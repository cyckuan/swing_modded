GENERAL MOTORS SEEKING GLAMOUR IN FUTURE MODELS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the shadow of some of the world's most prolific
entertainment studios, another hub of creative activity is taking
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the shell of the former Orowheat bread bakery and mill,
about a mile from Walt Disney and Warner Bros. studios, General
Motors is beginning work on its new Southern California design
center.
</P>
<P>
   The studio, which will employ some 30 people, is expected to
begin operating in six months.
</P>
<P>
   The site in North Hollywood will bustle with engineers creating
designs on sophisticated three-dimensional modeling computer
systems and sculptors designing automotive concepts the
old-fashioned way: creating them from clay.
</P>
<P>
   The new design center brings back some of the creative talent
behind GM's previous Southern California design center, the
Advanced Concepts Center that closed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Saucedo, the design center's director, contributed to GM's
designs for the Geo Storm, the Chevrolet Corvette and the Buick
Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Renewing its presence in Southern California is essential for
General Motors to revive the look of its cars, said George
Peterson, president of AutoPacific Inc., an automotive consulting
firm in Tustin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since they left Newbury Park, which was a substantial
faux pas on their part, GM has lost touch with the California
design ethic,'' Peterson said. ``GM can be criticized for the
styling of cars that can at best be described as pedestrian.''
</P>
<P>
   What designers are aiming for with the North Hollywood studio is
anything but dull, Saucedo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we put it here in North Hollywood is the
kind of multicultural atmosphere and how close it is to the
studios,'' Saucedo said. ``We wanted something that had some
character _ something that had some history.''
</P>
<P>
   The center will focus on the future, said Wayne Cherry, GM vice
president for design.
</P>
<P>
   Designers will be able to collaborate electronically with other
GM designers in Michigan, Italy, Mexico, Austria and China, Cherry
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to become the industry leader in product
innovation,'' Cherry said.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, GM must use the design studio in North Hollywood to
its full potential, Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM, in the previous iteration in Newbury Park, was not used to
the fullest extent of its capability,'' he said. ``It was a
lifestyle-monitoring studio doing some concepts. I hope the charter
for the new studio is much broader than the old studio's.''
</P>
<P>
   Saucedo said the studio will be a version of GM's Corporate
Brand Center in Warren, Mich., where advance concepts are created.
</P>
<P>
   Projects will be viewed on screens that give designers a
life-size view of the cars they are creating, said Rob McCann, who
will oversee the computer-aided design studio.

FIRST LADY AND CHARLIE ROSE: COOKING, BREVITY AND BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For nearly an hour in an auditorium at the 92nd
Street Y on Wenesday night, Hillary Rodham Clinton answered
questions about her politics and her husband, about her failures as
first lady and as a candidate for office, about Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and about her kitchen skills (or lack thereof).
</P>
<P>
   But even Charlie Rose, who interviewed her, could not prompt the
first lady to respond to a question that has dogged her since she
started traveling through New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is for you take some stands here: Are you a
Yankees fan or a Mets fan?'' Rose inquired, grinning as he leaned
way forward in his arm chair. ``You can't be both. It's not
allowable in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've actually given up trying to talk about that, because I
can't convince anyone that I cared about the Yankees,'' Clinton
responded as she smiled back at her interviewer. ``So I don't want
to go there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a notable moment in a session that marked a new stage in
Clinton's gradual emergence as the unguarded candidate: A
full-fledged interview, in front of a paying audience, albeit in
what for Clinton should be friendly territory, Manhattan's Upper
East Side.
</P>
<P>
   For much of it, Clinton was more revealing than usual. Still,
her instinct for caution exasperated Rose, whether it was in was
talking about the Yankees (who are her preferred team, an aide
later explained), her roundabout attacks on Giuliani or an attempt
to offer a sunny account of her years in the White House, an
assertion that led Rose to cut off his guest in mid-sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was good about the impeachment?'' Rose demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I have a very interesting take on that,'' she said,
referring to the impeachment in the House, and subsequent acquittal
in the Senate, of President Clinton. ``What was good about it was
that we protected and saved the Constitution. And that was a very
good outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, in recounting her unsuccessful campaign for
national health insurance in 1994, Clinton suggested that she had
come under less criticism once she faded back from public view.
``You know, Charlie, it was so interesting for me to learn that it
was more acceptable for me to work behind the scenes than
publicly,'' she said. ``It says that we have a real problem with. .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   Rose finished her sentence: ``Strong women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you say that,'' Clinton retorted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' prodded her host.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not budge. ``I think it's a problem with the role of
a first lady. Because it's not a job. It's a role.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose did have some success, though. For much of the campaign,
Clinton has declined to reveal any details of private conversations
with President Clinton. She let on Wednesday night that the
president had advised his wife to be less verbose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is incredibly helpful, because I have a tendency when I
talk to issues to go on and on,'' Clinton said. ``I say, `These
issues are complex,''' said Clinton, who is running for office for
the first time. ``And he says, `You've got to get it down to 10 or
15 seconds.'''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Clinton said her discussion of her kitchen skills in
the speech when she announced her candidacy, when she boasted of
making a ``mean tossed salad'' and a good omelette, had been
misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was a clear way of saying, `I can't cook,'''
she said. ``I thought it was a funny way of saying I can tear up
lettuce and break eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Break eggs?'' Rose repeated back to her. ``You just gave it
away.''

BIZARRE TIFF ENDS AS GOV. DAVIS APPOINTS S.F. MAYOR BROWN TO 
 RETIREMENT BOARD
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ Ending a bizarre tiff between two powerful
California Democrats, Gov. Gray Davis Wednesday appointed San
Francisco Mayor Willie Brown to the state retirement board _ a post
the mayor says he already held.
<P>
   In what Davis officials say was an embarrassing mixup, an aide
to the governor mistakenly sent Brown the paperwork necessary for
appointment to the board several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   A Davis spokesman said the appointment was not made until after
Davis and Brown met Wednesday afternoon for 45 minutes in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``All appointees of the governor represent his views _ not
theirs _ on the boards which they serve,'' said Davis spokesman
Michael Bustamante. ``They are not free agents. Appointments are
not made until the governor has a chance to talk personally with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brown was clear Wednesday morning, telling the Chronicle
that he had already taken the oath of office for the job, which
made him a member of the Public Employees Retirement Board, whether
Davis liked it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the oath of office and I am on the board,'' Brown said
in an interview before his meeting with Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' trip to see Brown in San Francisco Wednesday was not
originally on either man's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante said Davis, who had been considering Brown for the
post for some time, is now ``confident Brown will fairly reflect
his views on CalPERS.''
</P>
<P>
   The appointment comes at an awkward time for the media-sensitive
Davis. On Tuesday, a federal grand jury issued a subpoena demanding
information on Brown's dealings with the city's minority
contracting program.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment incident started last month when a Davis aide
called the CalPERS board seeking a telephone number for Tom Clark,
the board member Brown replaced, to tell Clark he was no longer on
the board.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Brown's appointment seeped out. A press release
announcing Brown's appointment was prepared by Davis' staff but not
released.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted by reporters, Davis said through a spokesman he
had not yet appointed Brown, a declaration they continued to make
throughout the day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Davis speak personally about it to Brown until Tuesday,
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called to say some staff person had inadvertently got in
front of him,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   But several legal sources contacted by The Chronicle said it was
too late for Davis to do anything but agree to the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's Feb. 9 oath of office as member of the Public Employees
Retirement System board is on file in the secretary of state's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is a dynamic addition to the 13-member board that manages
the largest public pension fund in the country, with assets
totaling more than $171 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the members are elected, four are set by law and three
are appointed. Brown is one of the governor's two appointments.
</P>
<P>
   One of the board members who likely will be least happy with
Brown's appointment is State Controller Kathleen Connell.
</P>
<P>
   Davis dislikes Connell, and acting at Davis' behest, the crafty
and persuasive Brown could undercut her influence on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Connell said she was ``glad'' to see Brown on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Brown would be carrying out Davis' wishes, Connell
said, ``I would hope we all implement a common vision here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown also has ties to State Treasurer Phil Angelides, a board
member and former head of the state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who skipped Wednesday's meeting of the retirement board,
could forge a bridge between Angelides and Davis that has not
existed before.
</P>
<P>
   Board members do not receive a salary.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Brown, whose job on the board is to represent local
governments, presides over a city that has its own retirement
system.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 2,000 of the city's employees are members of CalPERS.

 IN THE MARKET FOR A RICH SPOUSE?  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ My taste in TV viewing has risen to new depths.
</P>
<P>
   I watched ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' Tuesday
night, and I give it three thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty women competed, beauty-contest style, to be chosen to
marry an anonymous man. Mr. X made his pick, then the happy couple
was married onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers, I'm sure, were offended. They think the justice of
the peace should have said, ``I now pronounce you creep and
desperado.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``You may now kiss the bride, tell her your name and give
her a platinum card.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``Till sanity do you part.''
</P>
<P>
   It was beyond weird. Who would think a show this educational
would be on anything but PBS?
</P>
<P>
   I'm kind of proud, because I'm indirectly responsible for the
show. Several years ago, a writer named Michael Silver and I did a
one-shot pilot radio show here in San Francisco, and Mike Fleiss,
the executive producer and co-inventor of ``Who Wants to Marry,''
was our producer /co-conspirator.
</P>
<P>
   The show bombed like the Enola Gay, whereupon Fleiss fled to Los
Angeles and got into TV work and became rich and famous. He owes me
big.
</P>
<P>
   OBVIOUSLY, ``Who Wants to Marry'' will not be a one-shot wonder.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Fleiss if he would do a flip-flop show, with a
super-rich woman sorting through a field of hunky dudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already had three women come forward and offer to do
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, there was a prenup to Tuesday night's wedding. Or as
Fleiss said, ``There was paperwork in place for the protection of
both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Was the bride required to commit to a minimum length of
marriage? Nope. No cover, no minimum.
</P>
<P>
   And Fleiss says Mr. X didn't do this for a goof.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sincere in his desire to meet the right woman, and he
really felt it was his destiny to do it this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it beats hanging out in the Safeway produce aisle and
asking babes for tips on squeezing cantaloupes.
</P>
<P>
   SOMEBODY keep an eye on the cable cars and Coit Tower.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of America's home office in Charlotte, N.C., is
functioning as a black hole, sucking in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   BofA President Ken Lewis told the Charlotte Observer, ``We have
some very complicated businesses across America and I always
(would) rather have people closer to me than not. So every chance I
get to bring more things into Charlotte, I'm going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And most BofA things that are not in Charlotte are here in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is the bank's No. 2 exec and designated heir to the throne
of Hugh McColl.
</P>
<P>
   Hey Ken, feel free to take the Banker's Heart sculpture at
Kearny and California. You could use it as a paperweight.
</P>
<P>
   Or will you be needing it in S.F. as a wrecking ball?
</P>
<P>
   BELT-CINCHING, the BofA has a new travel policy that has caught
the attention of flying execs.
</P>
<P>
   Business fliers are reimbursed for airline tickets, but only the
amount of the lowest fare on any airline flying that route. So if
you pay $500 and the bank's computer finds a $300 fare on Acme Air,
you eat $200, even if you spent last weekend pruning the bonsai
plants around your neighborhood's Versateller ATM.
</P>
<P>
   I THOUGHT that was a wine rack: J.P. Murphy heard the traffic
reporter on KGO advise, ``If you're going on a ski trip, make sure
that your rental car has a ski rack.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy plans to give it a try, figures maybe it will work better
than just tossing the skis onto the top of the car and hoping for
the best.
</P>
<P>
   TO CLARIFY stuff you may have read here:
</P>
<P>
   I wrote that Michael Jordan could give trash-talking lessons to
Bill Bradley. Readers said, ``What? That well-mannered gentleman
Jordan?''
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Jordan was the NBA's foremost trash talker. Taunts, digs,
insults, challenges. Devastating, because he could back up his
words.
</P>
<P>
   And ... While the Coolidge did sink in WWII after the captain
steered his liner into a friendly minefield in the S. Pacific, the
captain was following the routing given him by our own Navy, a
reader points out.
</P>
<P>
   ALL YOU HEAR about the stock market whizzes is that they're
making money by the trunkful. What you don't hear about is the
pressure and tension involved.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning on the floor of the Pacific Exchange,
44-year-old John Lawson dropped dead of a heart attack. In a
cutthroat biz, Lawson was, I'm told, a sweetheart of a guy. Also a
devoted dad and an avid runner.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. BUSH isn't the only candidate who takes liberties with
the language. One reader has noticed that Al Gore always talks
about ``nuculur'' weapons and energy.
</P>
<P>
   And here come the judge: Harriet Hultquist found in her Solano
County sample ballot this statement from a candidate for Superior
Court judge: ``My wife and me have three daughters/ ...''
</P>
<P>
   The proper wording, of course, would be: ``My wife and me/have
daughters three.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
The Rockets still have quite a ways to go in their push to be a
.500 team, but they got a little closer Wednesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost seven feet closer, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Rogers, the 6-11 forward who has been recovering from
surgery to repair torn ligaments in his right thumb, practiced with
the team Wednesday, his first workout since being put on the
injured list Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   For Rogers, it was a welcome break from the tedium of watching
games from the sidelines, wishing he could get out and run with his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me it would take six weeks (to return), but to me,
whenever I feel like I can do something with it, I want to be out
there on the floor,'' Rogers said. ``I hate it. I hate watching
basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like sitting on the bench. I've been out of the game
for a long time, so the first time a doctor says it looks good (to
return), I'm going to get out there on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Not soon enough for the Rockets, who have spent much of the
season adding bodies _ mostly large bodies _ to the injured list.
And with back-to-back games against the Spurs _ at San Antonio on
Friday and Compaq Center on Sunday _ and their twin towers of Tim
Duncan and David Robinson, having a long body like Rogers back
would certainly help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy with him being here,'' said Rockets coach
Rudy Tomjanovich. ``I just talked to Keith Jones, our trainer, and
he feels right now that it isn't a physical deal as far as the
injury (keeping Rogers off the court), but it's just basketball,
when he can get ready. Possibly by Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, but not positively, everyone is quick to caution.
While Rogers is antsy about returning, the last thing he wants to
do is reinjure the thumb, causing yet another prolonged stay on the
injured list.
</P>
<P>
   But Rogers is still waging an internal war, doing everything
possible to hasten his return to the lineup, including a few things
he shouldn't have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cut casts off (his wrist and thumb),'' said Rogers,
laughing. ``You do whatever it takes to give you something to hold
on to. When I had that cast on, my hand started going dead and I
couldn't feel anything. That's not how I wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that in order for me to be effective, I have to be able
to do something with that ball in my hand, so I did a couple of
things I wasn't supposed to do, but it worked out for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rogers was right where he wanted to be Wednesday, back on
the court with the Rockets, he still is far away from where he
wants to be as far as his conditioning is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good,'' said Rogers of his first day back at practice.
``My timing is OK, but I know I have to get my conditioning back.
That's NBA condition. You always think you're in pretty good shape
because you run up and down and you're not really tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once you're banging, pushing and running, that's a whole
different game. That's what I'm working on now, trying to get back
in shape. But my timing is good compared to what I thought it would
be (after) not being able to use this hand at all. That's a plus
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   A minus for Rogers, however, has been the big-man rotation the
Rockets have employed _ one that has been working quite well of
late.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Cato starts at center and Matt Bullard at power forward,
with Hakeem Olajuwon and Kenny Thomas coming in off the bench.
Rogers, who was averaging 9.1 points before the injury, knows he's
going to have to work his way back into the game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the hardest thing in the NBA is trying to get back
into the rotation,'' Rogers said. ``I think that's going to be my
biggest fight right now, trying to get back in and fit in well with
what they're trying to do. They're out there, you're learning new
plays, so this is like starting all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A plus for me is that none of the plays were really run for
me. I got most of my points by feeding off somebody else, so I
think I can still bring that to the table as well as run the floor.
I'm not really threatened by any of this. I'm not worried about it
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich doesn't anticipate any problems in trying to get
playing time for the versatile Rogers, who can play any of the
three frontcourt positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``(When Rogers returns) we'll have an athletic, all-around
player that I thought was playing consistently for our team,''
Tomjanovich said. ``He had a lot of highs but not a whole bunch of
lows. I think he fits in our style of play and our system real
well.''

L.A. MAYOR NAMES CEO FOR KEY CONVENTION COMMITTEE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Frustrated at his lack of control in planning for
the upcoming Democratic National Convention, Mayor Richard Riordan
named one of his top aides Wednesday to serve as chief executive
officer for the Host Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Noelia Rodriguez, who has been Riordan's chief
spokeswoman since 1994, will replace Lucy McCoy, who is stepping
down as president of the group after more than a year of work that
included winning the bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for the mayor to increase his involvement and
he wants to be involved in day to day planning,'' McCoy said. ``And
it's appropriate for him to bring someone from his own staff in to
make that happen. The committee is in the final phase of its work
and the mayor wants to be involved. This is good overall for the
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's decision to install Rodriguez in the post came only
this week after more than a month of concern over the Host
Committee's work both in fund-raising _ it is still about $8
million short of its $33.5 million goal _ and in planning for the
mid-August convention.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor apparently also was concerned that he and the city not
be embarrassed during the event, as they were at the millennium
celebration on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 40, who came to work for Riordan from Southern
California Edison Co., is taking a leave of absence from her city
post to take on the DNC work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for me and, as we move from
planning to implementation, the mayor wanted somebody he has
confidence in to take it to the next stage,'' Rodriguez said. ``The
Host Committee is in good shape and the all the components are
there. It's just putting it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   She is to make the transition into the job over the next week,
and said she will continue to consult with the mayor on city
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``As one of my trusted advisers for six years, I know Noelia
possesses the strategic skills, public relations expertise and
tenacity to get things done,'' Riordan said. ``As CEO of L.A.
Convention 2000, she will serve me and Los Angeles well as we
finalize preparations to host the best convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Host Committee is separate from the group that is planning
the convention itself. The Host Committee is responsible for
bringing together the various city services that will be required _
police and traffic control, primarily _ as well as coordinate other
events related to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Mayors of cities that host such conventions normally play a very
active role. Los Angeles' situation is different in that the Host
Committee is a private organization; the city is to provide
services, but no funding. All the money is to be raised privately.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion is that Riordan is a Republican serving
as host to the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is a registered Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy said she will be working with Rodriguez on the transition
and will then return to her public affairs company.

HUMBLED DODGERS START OVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ In 47 days, the Dodgers can begin shedding
last season's disaster. Forty-seven days and the Dodgers, still
without a playoff win since 1988, open the season at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The path of optimism that leads to the start of the season
begins today as pitchers and catchers voluntarily report to
Dodgertown.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike a year ago when folks around here were pushing out
their chests and tempting the rest of the baseball world to take
their best shots, a humility has taken over. A 77-85 record and
third-place finish has that effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be more reserved,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone said. ``Last year we had a very talented group, but we found
out we weren't quite as good a team as we hoped to be. We don't
feel the pressure of expectations and high hopes that were created
by everyone last year.''
</P>
<P>
   After adding more than $120 million in free-agent contracts last
offseason only to fall flat, very little is expected of the Dodgers
this season. They traded Raul Mondesi for Shawn Green and shipped
Eric Young and Ismael Valdes to the Chicago Cubs for reliever Terry
Adams.
</P>
<P>
   After making big free-agent signings in 1998, the Dodgers were
less visible this time around when they signed reliever Gregg
Olson, veteran pitcher and Dodger favorite Orel Hershiser and
utility outfielder F.P. Santangelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some things that we needed, and I think you're going
to get a chance to see that,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``I think we have a chance to be a very good ballclub. How good? It
depends on the players. I wouldn't say we're as flush as the
Yankees or Cleveland (with talent and balance), but we've made
strides.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers went heavy on getting ``character players''
during the offseason, there are still plenty of questions that need
answers if they're going to compete for a postseason berth.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, can Mark Grudzielanek play second base? For
the second straight winter Grudzielanek worked with former big
leaguer Bucky Dent in Florida. But unlike a year ago when he
re-trained his brain to play shortstop, Grudzielanek had to learn
the basics of a new position.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also need to know if Alex Cora can hit enough to be
the everyday shortstop. Or will Juan Castro or Jose Vizcaino
surprise and win the job?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably going to live with Grud to make sure he can turn
a double play,'' Johnson said. ``I'm going to be breathing down on
Cora and Castro and Vizcaino. I'm going to be watching them closely
with my glasses on.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Grudzielanek have a new position in the field, but
he's also the favorite to replace Young at the top of the batting
order. It's a crucial spot to set up the trio of Gary Sheffield,
Green and Eric Karros, who combined to drive in 336 runs last
season.
</P>
<P>
   While second base and shortstop are question marks, third base
also could be a troubling situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers could still lose Adrian Beltre if an arbitrator
reverses commissioner Bud Selig's decision and grants the
20-year-old third baseman free agency. At that point, it may only
be a few weeks until the season begins.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers lose Beltre, Vizcaino and Kevin Orie would most
likely platoon at third.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how you plan for it, if we were unfortunate in
regards to keeping Adrian, you just can't replace a young,
athletic, talented player like that,'' Malone said. ``To me, you
can prepare all you want, but being prepared and replacing Adrian
Beltre are two different things. Being prepared doesn't mean we
have a suitable replacement.''
</P>
<P>
   While the corner positions in the outfield are set with Green
and Gary Sheffield, there's a battle looming in center field. Devon
White is on the trading block, and if he doesn't play well could
lose his job to Todd Hollandsworth, or find himself in a platoon
system. Either way, Johnson is eyeing his center fielder as the
Dodgers' all-important No. 2 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of important, catcher Todd Hundley is healthy after
struggling last year while recovering from shoulder surgery late in
the '98 season. After the fiasco that swirled around him for much
of last season, that should be welcome news for the Dodgers. And
Hundley won't have to spend a spring answering questions about when
he's going to finally get behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Like the position players, there are spots on the pitching staff
that have to be settled. The Dodgers traded Mondesi because he was
unhappy and Young to dump $9 million of salary and end a feud with
Johnson, but Malone and Johnson both said trading Valdes became an
option because of Eric Gagne's emergence last season.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen whether Gagne, a 24-year-old rookie
right-hander with five major league starts, can be the fourth
starter the Dodgers envision. There are also questions about the
fifth starter, a battle between long-forgotten Carlos Perez and
Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the team would like to see more development from Chan
Ho Park and Darren Dreifort. They combined to go 26-24 last season,
but neither pitched well until the Dodgers were well out of
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we recognized it's a lot harder to win than people
think because you can have a lot of talent, but you don't win for a
lot of different reasons,'' Malone said. ``We addressed that and
put together a team that will enable us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the Dodgers rate positionally heading into spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   Position Comment Rating
</P>
<P>
   First base Eric Karros can deliver 30 homers, 100 RBI in his
sleep. Settled
</P>
<P>
   Second base Mark Grudzielanek was fine at short, but can he
pivot on the double play. Suspect
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Alex Cora can field, but batting is the question. A
.143 average in 60 games. Suspect
</P>
<P>
   Third base If Adrian Beltre remains with club, all is fine.
Otherwise, Kevin Orie and Jose Vizcaino platoon. Unsettled
</P>
<P>
   Catching Todd Hundley worked on conditioning in the offseason.
How much did he improve? Unsettled
</P>
<P>
   Left field With transition to left field complete, Gary
Sheffield should flourish. Settled
</P>
<P>
   Center field GM Kevin Malone talked with Devon White about
expectations. White missed three weeks of `99 without going on
disabled list. Suspect
</P>
<P>
   Right field Shawn Green brings his 42 homers and 123 RBI into
the middle of the lineup. Settled
</P>
<P>
   Starters Kevin Brown, Chan Ho Park and Darren Dreifort are the
top three, but can rookie Eric Gagne be No.4? Unsettled
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Closer is Jeff Shaw, but how will trio of Alan Mills,
Gregg Olson and Terry Adams co-exist? Can Onan Masaoka be
situational lefty? Unsettled

at plate and in field. Settled

SCALABRINE CAUGHT IN DILEMMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC forward Brian Scalabrine admitted he has been
caught in a dilemma lately, worried about whether he should focus
on grabbing rebounds or blocking out the other team's top
rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine grabbed just three rebounds last week against UCLA
but said he was concentrating on trying to keep Bruins forward
Jerome Moiso away from the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make a decision,'' Scalabrine said. ``I can block
out and let (my teammates) go for a rebound, or I can go for the
ball. If I block out, I get chewed out for not getting rebounds,
but you have to make a decision. It's a Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine said if he just tries to block out, it allows forward
David Bluthenthal to grab more rebounds. Bluthenthal is averaging
10.6 rebounds in Pacific-10 Conference games, the best mark in the
conference. As for Scalabrine, he is averaging 6.1 rebounds in
conference games.
</P>
<P>
   No redshirt: If he doesn't return from his broken ankle, it
appears forward Jarvis Turner will be unable to redshirt. According
to NCAA rules, Turner would be allowed to play in six games, and
the senior appeared in seven games before his injury.
</P>
<P>
   Road test: Scalabrine said he did as little as possible over the
Trojans' eight-day break but is still unsure if he has regained the
bounce in his legs. After the loss to UCLA, he complained that he
could not drive to the basket, because he had trouble getting out
of ``first gear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually can't find out until the game starts,'' Scalabrine
said. ``They feel the same as before. In games, I can't get into
second gear. I'll find out (today).''
</P>
<P>
   In search of a win: USC has tried to keep a ``one-
game-at-a-time'' philosophy, even in the midst of its three-game
losing streak, but the Trojans (13-9, 6-4) realize the odds for a
victory this weekend are much greater against Arizona State than
No. 4 Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're preparing for Arizona, and we don't want to look ahead,
but I'll say this, the only thing is, I'm trying to get a split,''
Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   USC probably needs to win one more road game and its final four
home games to earn an NCAA berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just four more wins is really shady to get into the
tournament,'' freshman guard Nate Hair said.
</P>
<P>
   Just keep shooting: Hair is coming off one of his worst games of
the season, a 1-for-9 shooting effort against UCLA, but said he
hasn't lost any confidence in his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't shoot too well, but I don't anticipate doing that
again soon,'' Hair said. ``Coach Bibby tells everybody I'm going to
pull you out if you pass up an open shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hair said he is still recovering from the stress fracture he
suffered in his knee before the season, and it affects his ability
to drive to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have good days and bad days. Slowly, but surely, I'm coming
back,'' Hair said. ``I can't go to the hole and dunk like I used
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Added to list: Scalabrine is among 11 players that have been
added to the original list of 30 finalists for the Wooden Award and
Wooden All-American team.

PEERS AMAZED BY TIGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rain permitting, the Nissan Open will begin t oday
at Riviera Country Club, where, again, most of the buzz regards Tig
er Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The world's No. 1-ranked player captured the attention of
golfers everyw here -- and plenty of non-golfers as well -- by
winning six consecutive PGA Tour starts before Phil Mickelson
prevailed in last week's Buick Inv itational to end the tour's
longest win streak in 52 years.
</P>
<P>
   Woods fell five wins shy of Byron Nelson's PGA Tour-record
streak of 11 but not at all in the estimation of some distinguished
touring brethren who will join him this week at Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited that another friend of mine won last week,''
said David Duval, the world's No. 3-ranked golfer. ``But I was kind
of hoping to se e Tiger win again - I wanted to see him run that
record down.''
</P>
<P>
   That would have necessitated Woods running over Duval this week
as well, but that's the kind of interest Woods, 24, has created
after winning 17 times in less than five full seasons. ``You have
to see for your own eyes how good this guy is,'' said Ernie E ls,
the defending Nissan Open champion and a two-time U.S. Open winner
` `I look at him for motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   The motivation increased the last time he went head to head with
Woods. Els played his last three holes in 3 under par, only to have
Woods go 4- under in the same stretch and win the Mercedes
Championships for his fou rth win of the streak.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Open and Riviera record-holder Ted Tryba (61 last year)
offered t his during a rain break on the practice range Wednesday:
``As far as his winning the tournaments he's winning and how he's
winnin g, I think it's unbelievable. But then when I go watch him
play and I wa tch him hit balls and I watch him putt, it seems
pretty believable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now he's the best player in the world, and the question
we need to answer as players out here is, is going to get better or
is he going to come back to us? It's hard to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is hardly the only player of note at the Nissan , which
includes F red Couples, Justin Leonard, Mark O'Meara, Jesper
Parnevik, Steve Pate a nd Hal Sutton and many others who will play
in next week's Anderson Cons ulting Match Play Championship at La
Costa.
</P>
<P>
   But Duval, for one, doesn't tire of the talk of Woods: ``No, I
don't,'' said the man who was No.1 in the world before being rep
laced by Woods last year. ``Just because it's what needs to be
talked ab out at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be honest about this - he's doing some things all of us
wish we were doing, and it's neat stuff The buzz it's created and
was creating and does create is something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval got another feel for that Wednesday, while slogging up
Riviera's ninth fairway during a rainstorm. ``I looked over at No.
18. it's 11 o'clock, it's raining, it's cold and there's several
hundred people watching him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact he's had and is continuing to have - you see how
he's viewe d outside our game now. It's hard for me, a friend of
his, to grasp who he is and what he represents because he's become
such a big star, but I don't look at him that way. So it's just
kind of a weird deal for me, in a good way It's weird, but it's
cool to see.''
</P>
<P>
   If Duval feels conflicted about the larger-than-life persona of
his frie nd and rival, the ormer No. 1 feels absolutely certain he
and the rest o f the current PGA Tour participants are playing in
this league at the ri ght time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're very lucky to be a part of it right now, to be a
part of the game . I feel like I'm very lucky to be out here
playing against hi m and to be given the opportunity to compete
with him and to give him a good beating now and then. It's a neat
time.''

BRUINS RUNNING OUT OF TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The math gets simpler, the nerves get tighter and the margin for
error gets smaller with each defeat. The UCLA Bruins, losers of
four of their last five, are running out of time to secure an NCAA
Tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   At 13-9 overall and 4-6 in the Pac-10, the Bruins must win five
of their last eight games to reach the 18-victory plateau that
should secure an at-large bid.
</P>
<P>
   A breakdown of the remaining games makes tonight's matchup at
Arizona State critical to UCLA's postseason path:
</P>
<P>
   - Give the Bruins three home victories over Pac-10
bottom-feeders Oregon State, Washington and Washigton State, making
them 16-9 overall and 7-6 in conference.
</P>
<P>
   - Give them two losses at against heavyweights Stanford and
Arizona, both on the road, dropping their record to 16-11 and 7-8.
</P>
<P>
   - That means the Bruins must win two of three games against
Oregon (home), Arizona State (road) and Cal (road). If they fail
tonight, the pressure will be enormous against the Ducks and Bears,
and both beat the Bruins in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to try to get two wins back because of our earlier
losses,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``If we have the
Washington and Cal (defeats) back, then we're 15-7 and it's a
typical UCLA season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But because we lost to Cal and Washington, we're 13-9 and we
have a smaller margin for error. Our backs are to the wall a little
more. ''
</P>
<P>
   The players are aware of their predicament; they can't escape it
. But they refuse to play the numbers game or term individual games
``must wins.'' They claim to have Arizona State in the crosshairs,
nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get ahead of ourselves, that's when we tend to mess up
,'' guard Rico Hines said. ``When we think about North Carolina, we
lose to USC. We've got to get everybody on the same page and take
care of ASU.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie's, err, house: The Bruins held high-scoring ASU guard
Eddie House to 18 points last month in Pauley Pavilion. But they
're bracing for a huge game from House tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll come with more fire than last time,'' said UCLA guard
Ray Young, who played against House in high school in the Bay Area.
``He'll probably try for a 30- or 40-point game, and he's probably
due for a 3 0- or 40-point game.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU is 9-2 when House scores at least 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   A clarification: UCLA did not submit JaRon Rush's ap peal to the
NCAA last week, as previously reported. Instead, the Bruins filed a
supplemental report that answered lingering questions the NCAA h ad
about UCLA's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins expect to file the appeal of Rush's 29-game
suspension this week and hope to have a response next week.
</P>
<P>
   Giving back: UCLA assistant coach Michael Holton will give a
motivational speech Tuesday morning at Stephens Middle School i n
Long Beach. Holton, who attended Stephens as an eighth grader, will
address over 100 student-athletes. His theme: don't stop believing.

MCCAIN PICKS UP ENDORSEMENTS FROM TWO WHO HAD OPPOSED HIM
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Arizona Senator John McCain flashed his
conservative credentials in the heart of Republican South Carolina
Wednesday, touting his military background and the endorsements of
two party stalwarts who had opposed his candidacy prior to his New
Hampshire triumph.
<P>
   Former rival Gary Bauer, the Reagan administration official who
had championed socially conservative causes, and California
Secretary of State Bill Jones, who had previously endorsed Texas
Governor George W. Bush, both said that McCain now represented the
GOP's best chances of capturing the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That contention was buoyed by a New York Times/CBS poll that
found that voters' impressions of Bush had diminished so
substantially that after months of favorable ratings, as many
people now dislike him as like him.
</P>
<P>
   The developments came as McCain made a final push for votes just
three days before a primary that is critical to his uphill quest to
win the GOP nomination. McCain _ a former Navy Pilot and POW _
draped himself in patriotic themes, seeking a bond with residents
of the state with the highest number of veterans per capita.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bones of South Carolinians lie in quiet groves that once
were killing fields all over the world, where they sacrificed
usually in defense of somebody else's freedom,'' McCain told
students at Furman University. ``There is no more patriotic state
in America than South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in Saturday's primary _ in a state with fewer
residents than the Bay Area _ were evident in the frenetic pace of
Wednesday's campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   A big McCain victory, coupled with wins Tuesday in Michigan and
Arizona _ where he is ahead in polls _ could make the Arizona
senator hard to stop.
</P>
<P>
   But a victory by Texas Gov. George W. Bush could be enough for
the GOP front-runner to turn back McCain's insurgent bid. Bush led
the polls by huge margins as recently as last month. But McCain's
victory in New Hampshire on February 1 has given him a surge of
support, and a poll released Wednesday showed the South Carolina
race in a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where gospel music dominates the radio waves, the
Confederate flag flies over the Capitol dome, and Republican Strom
Thurmond has been elected to the Senate every six years since the
days when segregation was the norm, it is not surprising that
candidates are vying for the mantle of being the true conservative
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned Wednesday on the other side of the state,
emphasizing his experience as a chief executive in contrast with
McCain's legislative career. He cited his success reforming Texas'
schools, welfare system, tort laws, tax code and juvenile justice
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a person who's coming with a record of reform,'' Bush told
supporters in the low-country town of Beaufort.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has allowed surrogates to suggest that McCain is stained
with traces of liberalism, while national conservative icons like
Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson and radio talk show host
Rush Limbaugh have begun to take up a crusade against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain's voting record in Washington puts him squarely
in the GOP mainstream, some conservatives are angered by his zeal
for campaign finance reform and financial penalties against tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   McCain hopes Bauer's support will help him with social
conservatives, who have rallied behind Bush and former State
Department official Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, the former president of the Family Research Council, made
a ban on abortion and an emphasis on Christian values the central
part of his campaign, which he abandoned after coming in last place
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Joining McCain onstage at Furman University outside Greenville,
Bauer declared McCain ``the best shot we have to end the era of
Bill and Hillary and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour later in Los Angeles, Jones _ California's top elected
Republican _ reversed his early endorsement Bush, saying that he
now believes McCain is the best choice for California and the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain can beat (Democratic Vice President) Al Gore in
November,'' Jones said. ``I hope George Bush can beat Gore, but I
know McCain can.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' defection is more bad news for the Bush campaign, which
has seen its huge lead in California cut in half since McCain's
18-point victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush still has the overwhelming support of California's
Republican establishment including the backing of Insurance
Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush, the GOP's only other state
officeholder, 28 of the 32 Republican assembly members and 14 of
the 15 GOP state senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill wants to be on the winning team, he ought to stay
here,'' Bush said while campaigning in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign has spent $50 million trying to kill this
man (politically), but (McCain) won't go away because of the
message and the messenger,'' Jones said at a Los Angeles news
conference. ``I can understand why there are hard feelings (among
Bush supporters), but I didn't want this opportunity to pass me
by.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush once enjoyed an aura of invincibility, the New York
Times poll suggests that it has been greatly diminished by McCain's
success in New Hampshire. Nationwide, Bush is favored by 53 percent
of Republican primary voters as compared to 33 percent for McCain.
Just three months ago, Bush held a 68 percent to 8 percent lead.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1225 adults also found that McCain's message of
reforming campaign finance laws was far more popular than Bush's
plan to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bush's advantages is his huge campaign treasury, though
the Texas Governor was forced to respond yesterday to concerns that
he has already spent $50 million of the record $70 million he has
raised. Bush said the campaign was  &LR; is ``on plan.'' His aides
dismissed reports that he has hastily arranged fund-raisers next
week to buck up the treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bush's expenses was a 30-minute television commercial
featuring conversations with South Carolinians; it ran on three
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also has been all over radio and television _
and even the telephone lines _ with a spot featuring conservative
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, who praises Bush's ``strong pro-life record
in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain has been demonized by advocates of legal
abortions for casting 82 votes against a women's right to choose
during his 17 years in Congress, the National Right to Life
Committee is sending a mass mailing to South Carolina voters
warning about McCain's support for using tax dollars for fetal
research.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has dismissed the attacks from the anti-abortion group as
being motivated by his proposal for laws to govern campaign
spending, which the group fears would limit its influence.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted for Reuters by the Zogby Group shows Bush with
43 percent support, McCain with 40 percent and Keyes with 4
percent. The poll has a statistical margin of error of 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 607 likely voters shows Bush with a 2-to-1
advantage among Republicans, but McCain with a far larger advantage
among independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   All voters are eligible to participate in Saturday's Republican
primary, and the outcome will hinge on the number of independents
and Democrats who participate. In the 1996 GOP primary, 276,000
voters were cast. Officials expect 300,000 to 400,000 votes
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's hope that he can repeat his come from behind victory in
New Hampshire is evident in every speech he gives. At a morning
stop in Newberry, McCain mentioned New Hampshire 10 times in the
first nine minutes of his address.

JACQUELINE AURIOL, FRENCH FLIER AND TEST PILOT, DIES AT 82 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 7th graf to correct date of birth) 
 (DW) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jacqueline Auriol, the glamorous French flier who set several
speed records as one of the world's leading military test pilots in
the 1950s and '60s, died Saturday at her Paris home. She was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Auriol was born to the world of fine boarding schools and
country manors and married the son of the man who would become
president of France. However, she would eventually transcend her
role as the official tea pourer of Elysee Palace to succeed in a
field that had been almost entirely masculine, except for Hanna
Reitsch of Germany, a test pilot for the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Auriol's life was transformed when her face was crushed in a
1949 accident in a plane in which she was a passenger. She endured
33 plastic surgery operations over the next three years. (She did
not see her two sons, Jean-Claude and Jean-Paul, until her face was
as restored as possible. It seemed to work: a French newspaper
commented that her nose might now be American, but her smile
remained unmistakably French.) Rather than discouraging her, the
experience turned her resolve to achieving greatness in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Though she had learned stunt flying before her accident, her
goal became nothing less than breaking the sound barrier. She
watched the Vampire fighter being built in 1951 and eagerly
volunteered to be one of the first to fly it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day I experienced a sense of completeness,'' she told
Collier's magazine, ``an extraordinary sensation of power.''
</P>
<P>
   But she had to settle for being the second woman to break the
sound barrier, in 1953. The first was Jacqueline Cochran, an
American, earlier that year. The two Jacquelines were to become
famous rivals, as each in turn would edge beyond the other in
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Douet was born on Nov. 5, 1917, at Challans, a small
town on the Bay of Biscay. Her father, Pierre Douet, was a wealthy
shipbuilder. She spent most of her childhood at Nantes, then
studied art in Paris at L'Ecole du Louvre. On weekends, she would
ski in the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, she meet her future husband, Paul Auriol, through a
friend who was a ski champion. His father, Vincent, was a prominent
leader of the Socialist Party. Both families opposed an alliance
between Socialists and wealthy industrialists, so they insisted
they were too young to marry. She was sent to Sweden, while Paul
toured Italy.
</P>
<P>
   However, two years after their original meeting, they married at
a small mountain chapel. They divorced in 1967 and remarried in
1987. She was later widowed. Only her two sons survive her.
</P>
<P>
   When World War II broke out, she refused to leave France while
her husband was in the resistance movement. She lived in hiding
under a false identity. ``I began to realize that I loved danger,''
she told The Washington Post in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, her father-in-law became president and she, her
husband and Jean-Paul, her older son, moved into Elysee Palace. She
soon realized ``the parties and receptions were not enough to keep
my interest.'' At dinner one night, she sat next to a flying ace
and was so captivated by his stories that she asked if she and her
husband could take flying lessons from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult politically for my father-in-law because
so few women flew at this time,'' she said. ``I was pretty and I
knew I was pretty. There was publicity and I began to be heavily
criticized for my flying.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was that her husband gave up flying, while she
dropped out of the social and political life to devote herself to
it. Then the accident happened. She was a passenger when the pilot
attempted a dive and hit the water. He was barely hurt, but her
face and body were crushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was broken into a million pieces,'' she said. ``I had no
face, no nose, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   She needed a new purpose in life, and flying seemed to be the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the chance of my life to really become a good pilot,''
she said. ``Now that my beauty was gone I would have to derive a
reason for being from the plane which had taken it away.''
</P>
<P>
   As an aviatrix, as Current Biography listed her in its 1950s
coverage of her achievements, she flew more than 100 types of
aircraft. She received aviation awards from Presidents Truman and
Eisenhower. She was decorated with France's Legion d'Honneur and
wrote an autobiography called ``Vivre Pour Voler,'' meaning living
for flying. At her death, Jacques Chirac, president of France,
called her ``the incarnation of courage and modernity for the
French people.''
</P>
<P>
   Her conception of modernity did not include all of feminist
philosophy. ``These very feminist women irritate me when they say,
`Men hold me back,''' she said. ``It's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   But she never undervalued the effect of luck. She had a narrow
brush with death in 1956, for example, when her Mystere IV plane
went into spin and she managed to bring it back under control only
a few dozen yards from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was all worth it. In the Colliers interview, she spoke of the
rows of flowers on the grounds of Elysee Palace. ``Poor
creatures,'' she said, ``guardians and ornaments of the Elysee.
Once my life was like theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   She then smiled broadly. ``Perhaps I should teach them to fly,''
she said.

FAST FOOD TOPS WITH STATE'S SCHOOL KIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER   AND DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Taco Bell burritos, Domino's pizza and other fast
food have shoved aside healthier fare in many California high
school cafeterias, according to a statewide study released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 171 school districts throughout the state found
that 95 percent of high schools offered their students some type of
fast food, ranging from healthy snacks such as yogurt to fat bombs
like burgers. At 71 percent of the districts surveyed, fast food
accounted for 70 percent of all food sales in high schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Unified School District offers Taco Bell, Pizza
Hut and Subway Sandwiches menu items at local high schools and some
middle schools. But Carol Noelting, deputy branch director for food
service, said those items and other fast food _ including fruit,
cookies, yogurt and soda _ account for just 32 percent of high
school sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, researchers and dietitians already worried about the
growing obesity of American teens said fast food in the cafeteria
doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy for high school students to get fast food on
campus both the brand names like Pizza Hut and Domino's and the
nonbrand names _ that students just go for that first,'' said
Sharon Eller, a dietitian and spokeswoman for Project LEAN (Leaders
Encouraging Activity and Nutrition), a health advocacy group. ``We
may be teaching that health is important in the classroom, but as
soon as they walk out of the classroom, they can get fast food.''
</P>
<P>
   For students, choosing junk food is often a matter of
convenience and taste. Health concerns come somewhere after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the healthiest food, but it's not that bad either,''
said Jackie Dorfman, munching a Pizza Hut slice Wednesday at Canoga
Park High School.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the school districts polled said they included
fast-food items because students wanted them, nearly one-third said
they sell junk food to keep their budgets in the black. Many
reported using the money for facilities and athletic programs,
among other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That raises a lot of questions,'' said researcher Sarah
Samuels who conducted the survey for the nonprofit Sacramento-based
Public Health Institute. ``Do they need to make a profit? Or are
they so underfunded that they need to be making these choices?''
</P>
<P>
   The institute did not reveal which school districts took part in
the survey, saying researchers had promised districts
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Noelting said that at LAUSD schools, fast food serves as bait to
keep students in the cafeteria. That, in turn, increases the
chances that teens will start eating regular school lunches, which
must meet federal nutrition guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no profit in it for us,'' Noelting said. ``It's an
attraction to make sure they eat with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-food items can be the district's own. Los Angeles Unified,
for example, has its own brand of bottled water. But more than half
of the districts surveyed offered either Taco Bell, Subway,
Domino's, Pizza Hut or food from some other major brand.
</P>
<P>
   At Canoga Park High, students can buy Pizza Hut or Domino's
pizza as well as Subway sandwiches. Those items are sold at small
carts around campus so students can avoid long lines in the
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just buy it every day because it tastes good and it's not
too expensive,'' said LaRue Floyd, a sophomore. ``I wish they had
more stuff to choose from. There's nothing really good in the
cafeteria. If this is the only thing to choose from, then I'm going
to keep buying it.''

SHAW DELIVERS OFF THE BENCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE -- It takes a slump, foul trouble or injury to get
Brian Shaw into a game, but lately his play alone has been enough
to warrant more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly true Wednesday night, as Shaw contributed a
season-h igh-tying 10 points in 17 minutes off the bench in the
Lakers' 92-85 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really pleased with Brian Shaw's effort off the bench,''
coach Phil Jackson said after playing him the entire fourth
quarter. ``Our bench has been able to help us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's philosophy in such situations?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking to not make (Jackson) nervous, as he says I
always do when I'm on the court,'' he said. ``I just play solid
defensively and keep the ball moving. We have a tendency at times
to get stagnant and just kind of stand around and watch Kobe
(Bryant) do his thing or watch Shaq (O'Neal) do his thing. When I
come in I just try to make sure everybody touches the ball, it gets
from side-to-side in our offense, and pick up the tempo a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jackson favorite Ron Harper, slowed by any number of things
related to age, playing just 20 minutes, Shaw carried the load. In
a tight fourth quarter, he hit 2 of 3 shots for four points, adding
three rebounds, two assists and a blocked shot.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers up by just a point late in the game, Shaw hit a
20-foot jumper to make it 86-83 with 2:39 to go. Then he made a key
defensive rebound that led to an A.C. Green bucket that helped seal
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to have the opportunity to be out there in that
situation and for it to work out the way it did for us tonight,''
Shaw said. ``Hopefully it's somethign that I can build on, and
coach will have more confidence that I can come through in that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   No L.A. Toni: Jackson wasn't surprised at the news Wednesday
that Toni Kukoc had been traded by the Bulls to the Philadelphia
76ers . In fact, when Jackson spoke to his former pupil while the
Lakers were in Chicago, Kukoc said he felt something would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knew that it was imminent, that it was happening,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has previously been outspoken about his desire to
acquire Kukoc , but with warnings of tampering charges, he declined
to admit to any disappointment over the trade. Kukoc cannot be
traded again before the Feb . 24 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really guess I can't comment on that,'' Jackson said. ``I
just have to say that it was an interesting trade. I think it's
going to strengthen a couple teams. And Chicago's got some ducks in
a row. They want to hold all the balls (in the NBA draft
lottery).''

   DESIGN-LEGACY (New York) _ In London, Washington and, most
recently New York, attendance at the traveling exhibition on
Charles and Ray Eames, the post-war design mavericks, broke museum
records. But most people filing by to marvel at their plywood
molding experiments _ the prototypes that didn't quite cut it and,
eureka!, the ones that did _ were unaware that nearly every major
American institution had passed on the opportunity to buy the
Eameses legacy of furniture invention. The Museum of Modern Art and
the Metropolitan Museum of Art were among those that turned it
down, leaving the Eames family faced with huge inheritance taxes,
the threat of eviction and the prospects of selling off the
products, piecemeal, to resale stores. The preservation movement
that routinely takes up arms to protect buildings with an
established cultural significance has yet to take an active role in
saving America's modern design legacy. By Julie V. Iovine.

   METAL-INTERIORS (New York) _ Americans consumed 130 million tons

Armani offices and showroom, enough steel, aluminum and bronze has
gone in recently to make New York City the newest Rust Belt. And

 U.S. PORTS AWASH IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY  &HT;     By BILL WALLACE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ U.S. seaports are under siege by smugglers, drug
traffickers and other criminals, yet law enforcement agencies that
regulate them are understaffed and outgunned, U.S. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein told federal officials meeting here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug trafficking, alien smuggling, export of stolen
automobiles and international cargo theft are rampant,'' the
California Democrat told members of a federal task force
investigating seaport security issues during a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet, in spite of the fact that the major problems besetting
seaports all fall within the traditional jurisdiction of U.S. law
enforcement, no federal agency currently has comprehensive
authority to regulate activity at seaports.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was one of a host of speakers who turned out for a
day-long hearing held by the Interagency Commission on Crime and
Security in U.S. Seaports, a special working group made up of
representatives of 20 different federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's session was the second of three public forums to be
held by the commission. The panel, which was appointed by President
Clinton, began a detailed inquiry into law enforcement issues at
U.S. ports last summer and is scheduled to deliver a report
containing its findings and recommendations for reform to the
President in April.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks that kicked off the session, Feinstein said a series
of recent incidents at West Coast ports underscore the
vulnerability of U.S. ports in an age of transnational crime and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs Service inspectors had seized 132 kilograms of
opium last summer at the Port of Oakland, the largest opium seizure
in U.S. history, she noted. In addition, drug traffickers are
increasingly using regular freight cargo containers to ship cocaine
and other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There also has been an increase of alien smuggling in the last
few months at West Coast ports, including those at Los Angeles,
Long Beach, Seattle, Vancouver and Tacoma,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement sources tell her that such incidents are just
``the tip of the iceberg,'' said Feinstein, who is running for
re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein noted that American ports have too few Customs agents
for adequately monitoring incoming and outgoing shipments and often
lack modern crime fighting equipment such as scanners capable of
X-raying the contents of entire containers and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   She also said there is a lack of coordination of law enforcement
efforts by the organizations responsible for port facilities.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after Wednesday's hearing, U.S. Commissioner of
Customs Raymond Kelly, one of the three co-chairs of the
commission, acknowledged that stemming the tide of contraband and
human smuggling is a daunting task, but that the 201-year old
Customs Service is trying to figure out new and better ways to do
the job.
</P>
<P>
   He said the service had commissioned a Price Waterhouse audit of
its resources and functions in an effort to find ways to make the
agency more efficient, and is trying to find ways to finance new
technology it needs to improve its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need better information and we need better intelligence,''
he said. ``We need technology ... We need additional resources _
additional people to do the job.''

STORR OWNS CHICAGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO -- Kings goaltender Jamie Storr continued his mastery of
the Chicago Blackhawks in Wednesday's 4-1 victory at the United
Center .
</P>
<P>
   Storr raised his record to 5-1 lifetime against the Blackhawks
with a 1.25 goals against average. He defeated Chicago 3-2 on Nov.
16 even though the Hawks scored two goals in the final period and
outshot the Kings 23-1.
</P>
<P>
   Storr was sidelined with a concussion Dec. 18 when Chicago won 8
-4 in the middle of the Kings six-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it like it's me who won the game,'' said Storr
, who set a career high with his 13th victory. ``We play Chicago
well. They are physical, but we take it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Nov. 16 game, the Blackhawks came on in the third
period. Tony Amonte scored on a breakaway after the puck bounced
off the skat e of defenseman Rob Blake. Chicago later had several
excellent scoring c hances, but Storr, who made 25 saves, turned
them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lead and we held on to it,'' Storr said. ``This is
the first game of a big trip and we wanted to keep the momentum
going.
</P>
<P>
   Berg Sits: Defenseman Aki Berg, whose up and down season has
resulted in several benchings, was a healthy scratch against the
Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Berg did not play well last Monday against Calgary. Defenseman
Jaroslav Modry, whose only action the past month has come for minor
league Long Beach, played in place of Berg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he did it, but I'm not going to make too much
out of it,'' Berg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through the same thing when I played in New York,''
veteran Mattias Norstrom said. ``The most important thing when you
are sitting in the stands is not to sulk but to think how well you
will do when you get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Out: Third-line winger Craig Johnson missed Wednesday's
game due to a fluke injury that forced him to receive four stitches
to the middle finger on his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was cut when trying to open the window of his hotel room
. The window was broken and fell out of the sash, slicing his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray also elected to rest third-line winger
Marko Tuomainen, who is bother by a sore left foot. Donald Audette,
activated from injured reserve before the game after missing more
than a month with an left ankle sprain, took Johnson's spot in the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to be back after six weeks,'' Audette said. ``I've
stayed in good shape and I know that helped me tonight. I wanted to
be ready when I finally got back and I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Any Questions? Colin Campbell, NHL director of Hockey
Operations, and his assistant Mike Murphy will address the players
this afternoon at the team hotel in Detroit for an update on this
year's rul es changes.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial rules has involved goaltender
interference. Until this season, goals were disallowed when
offensive players were in the crease. But with scoring down, the
rules were relaxed and teams are complaining their goaltenders have
become easy targets.

LAKERS UP TO THE CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The Lakers snuffed out the hot-at-home
Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday, but it wasn't so much
team-versus-team as it was a series of personal challenges:
</P>
<P>
   Kobe vs. Eddie. Rice vs. the ghosts of past and future. Shaq vs.
himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was a clean sweep for the Lakers' three amigos as they used a
late defensive charge to grab a 92-85 victory at the soldout
Charlotte Coliseum. It was the Lakers' second fourth-quarter
comeback in as many nights, and fifth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   They got it when Kobe Bryant bested close friend and former
Laker Eddie Jones, outscoring him 26 to 18 in their first
head-to-head matchup.
</P>
<P>
   They got it when Glen Rice, who was buckling under the weight of
trade rumors and decreasing playing time, snapped out of his funk
to score 21 points against his old team.
</P>
<P>
   And they got it when Shaquille O'Neal, suddenly an ace
free-throw shooter, hit a pair of clutch shots from the line with
22.7 seconds left to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing special about beating ex-teammates or
ex-teams, Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just special to come here and win. It's a tough place to
play,'' he said. ``The guys have lost like three games here all
season long. So it was a big game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest play came from O'Neal, though not by design. With
the Lakers leading by 3 points, and 23.5 seconds left, they were
supposed to run down the clock before shooting. But they muffed the
inbounds play, O'Neal ended up with the ball and was instantly
fouled by ex-Laker Elden Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Swish. Swoosh. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal even left his hand dangling in the air after the second
shot for emphasis, then ran back to the bench for too many high
fives to count.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a gripping moment when Shaq has to go to the foul
line the last minute,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``We came back to
the bench, we said, `Don't worry about it, just go out there and
shoot them the way you've been shooting.' He did.''
</P>
<P>
   It capped a 26-point, 14-rebound night for O'Neal, who was
better from the line (6 for 9) than from the field (6 for 17). His
foul-shooting groove is now 32 for 41 (78 percent) over the last
three games.
</P>
<P>
   He's even enjoying such moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure did,'' he said. ``You see how I left my hand up there?
I ain't missing no more. I'm at a point in my life where it's time
to start concentrating now. So I've been concentrating these last
couple games and just developed more concentration, more confidence
and just keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been easy, it's just that I never cared before. I
never cared about shooting 80 percent,'' he said. And now? ``I
still don't care . I'm just taking my time, focusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing 90 minutes over two nights, O'Neal struggled from the
field but said it was due more to the Hornets' tactics than
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illegal defense, holding, fouling. The same (things) everyody
else does,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers trailed by six early in the fourth quarter, but
Robert Horry blocked Jones to spark a Bryant dunk at the other end
and the Lakers grabbed the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Hornets coach Paul Silas then rested Jones (who was 6 for 20),
and Bryant took advantage -- hitting three straight jumpers over
David Wesley for an 80-76 Laker lead, which they never
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Rice, playing in Charlotte for the first time since
forcing the Hornets to trade him last year, sent word through a
Lakers spokesman that he would not speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's starting to get his focus back,'' O'Neal said. ``I think
he's not bothered by whatever's going on outside of basketball,''
presumably constant trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Salley was constantly in his ear,'' Brian Shaw said. ``He
talked to him a lot on the plane last night. He knew he was going
to have a lot of emotion coming back and playing here. He just
wanted him to put all the trade rumor stuff aside and just go out
and do what he does.''

RADIO SIGNALS FROM MARS NOT FROM LANDER, NASA SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long radio search for messages from the lost Mars Polar
Lander ended Wednesday when NASA officials announced that the faint
radio signals they have tried to track apparently came from some
unknown source on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   One brief signal last month ``had all the earmarks'' of a
message from the spacecraft, said Richard Cook, the mission's
project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, ``and we felt
we had to check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   But weeks of detailed analysis showed that the signal didn't
come from Mars, and ``it is unlikely that we will attempt to listen
again,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The $165 million spacecraft was radioing steadily from space
December 3 as it flew on course toward its target near the Martian
south pole, but its signal vanished barely minutes before its
scheduled landing.
</P>
<P>
   The 150-foot radio telescope managed by SRI International on the
Stanford University campus picked up weak signals December 18 and
again January 4, and NASA officials called for help from scientists
and engineers at three radio telescope arrays in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the huge telescopes at Jodrell Bank in England, Westerbork
in the Netherlands and Bologna in Italy all failed to hear
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point I'm mystified,'' said Ivan R. Linscott, a senior
research engineer at Stanford who has led the effort at the big
Stanford dish-shaped antenna that is a familiar landmark above
Interstate 280 on the edge of the university campus.
</P>
<P>
   What finally convinced the experts that the mysterious signals
must have come from transmitters on Earth rather than from the
spacecraft was the continued stability of their radio frequencies,
Linscott said.
</P>
<P>
   If the signals had come from Mars, he said, their frequencies
would have varied wildly as they were buffeted by turbulence in the
electrically charged particles that stream from the sun in the
unending ``solar wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent experts named by NASA to a failure review board will
continue trying to determine what might have been the fate of the
lost spacecraft, but they can probably do little more than propose
speculative scenarios when they report next month, Linscott said.
</P>
<P>
   When the reports are in, NASA will have to decide whether
another orbiter and lander similar to the ones lost in December
should be launched in 2001, or whether new technology is needed and
the next Mars mission should be delayed until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The lost Mars lander was to have propelled two tiny
``microprobes'' into the soil of the target area in a search for
evidence of frozen water, and the lander itself would have
monitored weather in the south polar region, dig soil samples for
chemical analysis and photograph the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing series of Mars missions is designed to scout out
places on the planet where NASA hopes to send spacecraft to collect
samples of soil and small rocks and return them to laboratories on
Earth over the next decade.  &LR;

SPORTS COLUMN: WARD'S INJURY SWINGS THE MOOD FOR KNICKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs for rewriting throughout) 
(sw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the new, new National Basketball Association, you
really don't know exactly what is going to emerge from the runway _
the A effort or the B effort. The players themselves usually don't
know. They are just trying to keep healthy for the long march from
autumn to spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are inconsistent enough on their own, but now they
have external pressure on them. Charlie Ward fractured his right
pinkie in Wednesday night's game, which means the Knicks have to
replace 28 minutes a game at point guard for the next three or four
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They got the word minutes after they outlasted Minnesota, 93-89,
in a game that was more or less representative of the midwinter
trek to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had flown in from other cities on Tuesday night.
Minnesota had merely lost to Denver at home, but the Knicks had
been downright ghastly in Toronto. The Madison Square Garden factor
normally tends to energize both the Knicks and their visitors, but
Wednesday night's game was long on fouls and short on finesse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we would play hard tonight,'' the Knicks' coach, Jeff
Van Gundy, said with heavy emphasis on the word ``tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy added: ``But it's not about tonight. It's about
consistency. After good wins, how do we come back?''
</P>
<P>
   Then Van Gundy went out and got the news that his starting point
guard was hurt, which surely threatens any potential consistency
the Knicks have within them.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the Knicks. On Tuesday, Minnesota's young
star, Kevin Garnett, described the loop-the-loop logistics of the
league: there is always another game. Good grief, is there always
another game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these last few games show that when you relax and when
you don't come out with that focus or edge, you get beat up pretty
bad,'' Garnett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA's crazy like that,'' added the young sage from a
Chicago high school. ``You have one night when you're great and one
night when you're terrible. The best thing is that tomorrow is
another day.''
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistency in the league _ we are not talking here about
losing; we are talking about apathy _ is yet another symptom the
NBA is floundering right now. The television rating for the
All-Star Game last Sunday was the lowest since the game went on the
networks, down 35 percent from the last one, two years ago, when a
certain Michael Jordan still roamed the land. People are avoiding
pro hoops on Sunday afternoon in favor of Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night it was a distinct pleasure to push the clicker
and get away from Patrick Ewing's bemused scowl in search of George
W. Bush's characteristic smirk.
</P>
<P>
   The eminently clickable Knicks seem unable to put a few strong
games together, and Van Gundy does not want to blame road games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can lose the fight on the road, but when you have no
fight, that's a problem,'' Van Gundy said. ``Different guys take a
possession off. There is not a priority to set a tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Ward was hurt, Van Gundy was forced to take stock of
his team on Wednesday as the 76ers seemed to improve themselves by
trading for Toni Kukoc. If the Knicks have many more walkabouts
with Ward missing, they could be in jeopardy of losing the
home-court advantage in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Knicks had enough talent, Van Gundy screwed up his
face and remained silent long enough to make the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't separate talent from commitment,'' he said.
``Hustling is part of talent. It's all part of the same package.''
</P>
<P>
   He criticized his players for not being physical enough, despite
their reputation for aggression, most of which went north with
Charles Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are going in unimpeded,'' Van Gundy said, adding that his
players ``sort of got out of the way'' on layups Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The players seem mildly embarrassed but not to the point of
losing their cool or throwing themselves around on the floor after
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the Knicks who give off the stale aroma. The
new ownership of the Dallas Mavericks set a new low by renting the
definitive tired old act, Dennis Rodman, for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Although he can still rebound, Rodman basically stinks up the
league. He sat on the court, tossed his shirt, blustered, and later
suggested that he and Commissioner David Stern duke it out. On
Wednesday, he was fined $10,000 and suspended a game. It's really
the fault of the new owner, Joe Cuban, who hasn't been around long
enough to be embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   But hang in there. The playoffs are in two months. Charlie Ward
will be back by then.

RODMAN SUSPENDED ONE GAME, FINED $10,000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It didn't take long for forward Dennis Rodman to draw
the wrath of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   A week after playing his first game with the Mavericks, Rodman
has been fined $10,000 and suspended for one game. The penalties
stem from Tuesday's home game against the Milwaukee Bucks, when
Rodman verbally abused the officials and failed to leave the court
in a timely fashion after he was ejected with 7:13 remaining in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who has 29 rebounds in two games with the Mavericks,
will sit out tonight's 7:30 tilt against the Detroit Pistons at
Reunion Arena. The one-game suspension costs Rodman a game check of
$5,032, in addition to the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who has been heavily fined throughout his NBA career,
said he expected a fine or suspension after he used disparaging
remarks about NBA commissioner David Stern and the referees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fine, a heavy fine, I don't give a damn,'' Rodman said. ``Me
and David Stern need to clear our differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said \RTuesday\S night, let's get into a ring, and he
get naked and I get naked, and let's go on and get it on,
brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach Don Nelson said Rodman should have used better
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the commissioner will put on the boxing gloves
and box Dennis Rodman,'' Nelson said. ``I don't think that's going
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, he is in charge of Dennis' future, and a wise man
probably wouldn't jeopardize that. It's not a good idea to
challenge the commissioner. The commissioner will win every time.
Not in the ring; outside the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's suspension comes at a critical time. The Mavericks
trail Minnesota by seven games in the race for the eighth and final
playoff spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Mavericks were rolling along with 10 wins in 13
games before Rodman came on board. Since Rodman's arrival, some of
the players' minutes have been reduced, team chemistry has been
tampered with, and, more importantly, the Mavericks are 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Rodman thrusting the Mavericks into the national
spotlight in a negative light, the Mavericks must be privately
asking themselves if signing him was worth the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's a marked man,'' forward Cedric Ceballos
said. ``But in any given situation he does draw a lot of attention,
and they take that as a negative and don't want to see that
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's latest run-in started when he argued that the Bucks
should have been whistled for illegal defense. That drew a
technical from referee Ken Mauer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while Bucks guard Sam Cassell was preparing to shoot the
free throw as a result of Rodman's first technical, Rodman decided
to take a seat on the floor at the opposite end, near the
free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Referee David Jones noticed Rodman sitting down, then
immediately ejected him. Rodman proceeded to verbally abuse Jones
before leaving the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with the ejection if he sat in the middle of
the floor,'' Nelson said. ``I didn't see it. I was talking to one
of the referees at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who will be 39 in May, had five days off because of
All-Star weekend between his first and second games. Now, because
of his suspension, he'll have four days off before his third game,
Sunday in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play, and I want to help this team,'' Rodman said.
``It's a big challenge for me.''
</P>
<P>
   So is staying out of trouble with the NBA office. nn

STARS KILL OFF PENALTIES, PREDATORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In 47 seconds, the Stars saved 60 minutes. Their 3-0
victory against the Nashville Predators last night was won in the
span between the one-minute and 1:47 mark of the third period. The
Predators had a five-on-three power play in that time that the
Stars didn't just kill, but suffocated. ``I thought the kill at the
start of the third period brought it right back again,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said of the momentum that had been drained out
of the team in the second period. ``I thought our penalty killing
pretty much won the hockey game for us tonight.'' The Stars killed
off seven Nashville power plays. They've killed 71 of the past 74
they've faced. The crew of defenseman Richard Matvichuk, et al., is
doing what they do best, sucking the offense out of other teams.
``The Dallas Stars organization has proclaimed ourselves as the
defensive team of the NHL,'' Matvichuk said. ``And we've proven it
the last few years.'' A healthy dose of penalty kill along with
just enough of captain Mike Modano and backup goalie Manny
Fernandez proved it last night, putting them four points ahead of
the Phoenix Coyotes in the Pacific Division. They have a chance to
turn that into a six-point lead with a victory in tomorrow night's
showdown between the two division heavyweights. Modano scored two
of the Stars' goals, including a salty, back-breaking goal at 4:22
remaining in the third period. The goal was Gretzky and Jagr and
Lemieux all rolled into a three-second frame. Predators defenseman
Drake Berehowsky didn't have a chance as Modano danced around him
like Fred Astaire to get a wide look at the goal. ``I was just kind
of guessing,'' Berehowsky admitted. ``He had a lot of speed built
up, and I was just sitting back. I was trying to guess.
Unfortunately, he got off a good shot.'' He has been the Stars'
most-productive player since missing a game Jan. 15 with a mild
concussion. He has 16 points (eight goals and eight assists) in his
past 12 games. The statistic is even more impressive considering
the Stars have only 31 goals in that span, meaning he has been
involved in more than half of them. ``He's a dominant player right
now,'' Hitchcock said. ``He's a dominant player in a lot of
aspects. ... He's a dominant player in the full 200 feet of ice.''
It wasn't their best game, but it didn't have to be because once
again Modano was their best player. The good news for the Stars is
the last time the Stars played less than their best and won, they
came out the next game and took it out on Phoenix, kicking them
around, 2-0. The previous game against Atlanta, ironically, was the
closest Fernandez had ever been to a shutout; the Thrashers scored
with two minutes left. Last night Fernandez stopped 18 shots for
the first shutout of his NHL career.
``I think the guys felt a little bad about the last one. They kept
saying `I'm sorry,' '' Fernandez said. ``The first one is always
special when it's the first one. You get the first one out of the
way, and then you don't think so much about it and get reminded
every time about it. So now I'm just a regular goaltender now.''
The performance certainly wasn't anything new for Fernandez. He has
stopped 250 of the 263 shots he has faced in his past 10 starts.
His biggest saves last night were seconds apart midway through the
second period. Predators center Sebastien Bordeleau, with his feet
just on the edge of the crease, had two cracks at it. But Fernandez
stopped both, swallowing the second beneath his pads. Fernandez
said the key for him was Modano's goal 77 seconds into last night's
game on a play he created. He was bumping and grinding behind the
Predators' net before leaving the puck along the boards for winger
Brenden Morrow. Morrow dropped it to winger Jamie Langenbrunner,
who sent a no-look pass through the crease to Modano. He deked down
Nashville goalie Tomas Vokoun and then stuck it in for a 1-0 Stars
lead. Modano flashed this feisty style all night, including looking
like he might drop the gloves at one point in the third period. ``I
doubt it,'' Modano said with a chuckle. ``At times in the past, I
would try to hide and get away from the game. That's something I've
had to learn to deal with. It gets me in the game, challenges me.
When you get pushed like that into a corner, you fight back.'' The
game was the Stars' first of a string of seven games in 12 days, a
string that Hitchcock told him team before the game would be a
measuring stick. ``I still feel that way,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's
going to tell us a lot where we stand in this conference.'' nn

L.A. POLICE CHIEF CALLS FOR REBUILDING COMMAND STAFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a dramatic presentation to the City Council,
LAPD officials outlined a series of reforms Wednesday to prevent
the ``monstrous'' situation at the Rampart Division _ where
warnings were ignored or overlooked _ from occurring again.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Bernard C. Parks and his top deputies told the
council that the scandal already has led to implementing several
reforms in management and supervision. He pointedly noted that the
budget cuts imposed by the mayor and council over 20 years reduced
the number of command-level supervisors, a problem that became
critical in the patrol officer buildup in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The command staff needs to be rebuilt to previous levels and
internal affairs operations expanded sharply, he said. Changes in
state law and the City Charter are needed to use sting operations
and other methods to closely monitor officer conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could this go on?'' Parks asked. ``It's generally a lack
of oversight by command supervision all the way up through the
department.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronting pressure for an outside investigation of the LAPD,
Parks repeatedly reminded officials that it was the department
itself that began the investigation in 1998 as a result of cocaine
missing from evidence lockers.
</P>
<P>
   That led to the arrest of former Officer Rafael Perez, who has
since sought to reduce a projected 14-year prison sentence by
detailing a seemingly out-of-control anti-gang Community Resources
Against Street Hoodlums unit at the Rampart Division that assaulted
and shot gang members, planted evidence on them and lied in court
to win convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 1 priority is to make sure that those folks who were
imprisoned or are in jail because of this are set free,'' Parks
said, adding that criminal investigators have begun to move beyond
the investigation of Perez and are looking at other officers.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said officials were also looking at other CRASH teams and
all specialized units in the city to determine whether there are
other problems, as well as making changes to ensure there is
increased supervision of the units and that their roles are
clarified.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Mike Bostic, who has been in charge of a massive
Board of Inquiry project to be completed by March 1, said the
problems at Rampart should have been seen earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The systems were in place, but they were either overlooked or
ignored,'' Bostic said. ``This was a monstrous investigation.' As
part of the inquiry, profiles were conducted of Perez and 11 other
officers who have been fired or relieved of duty.
</P>
<P>
   In looking at their records from the time they applied to the
LAPD through their years on the force, Bostic said at least four of
them should not have been hired because of problems, particularly
involving debts, that should have been discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the department plans to administer polygraph tests to
all applicants to uncover these and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said he wants to see the department get the power to
periodically review the financial situation of officers as well as
stage periodic sting operations to uncover those who might have
gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the chief said he wants to expand the Internal
Affairs Group to the levels recommended by the Christopher
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems at Rampart was that the CRASH unit was in a
separate office with no direct supervision from anyone outside the
sergeant in charge of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Parks has already sent out an order changing that to require
that all CRASH units as well as specialized units such as narcotics
and vice report to a watch commander daily and also be involved in
roll calls.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue that needs to be addressed is the level of
supervision, Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   When the department began its massive buildup in 1994, the ratio
of officers to sergeants was seven to one. In 1994-95, the ratio
was lowered to eight to one, meaning less supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said the total number of supervisors dropped
dramatically after the 1978 passage of Proposition 13 and a series
of budget cuts in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we hired all these new officers, we never replaced the
supervisors,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a $9million package of reforming the department,
Parks said he wants to begin to replace those administrators to get
tighter controls.
</P>
<P>
   Council members, who had received the briefing in a closed
session two weeks ago, agreed under public pressure to Wednesday's
open meeting to review the state of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   They said they remained concerned about eliminating criminals
from the department and restoring public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Parks was asked whether a code of silence exists
within the Police Department in which officers refused to inform on
one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no different in this organization than in any other
organization,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Several council members expressed concern about public
perceptions of the scandal and efforts to fix the department.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who is campaigning for a state
Assembly seat, said she is constantly questioned about the Rampart
scandal and the fear people have of police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public wants to know how this was missed,'' Goldberg said.
``You had officers with tattoos, officers with gang initiations,
awarding plaques for shootings. I get told by people that they
don't trust the police anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying to me that they believe the presumption of
innocence is not there anymore. And it's not just the police. It's
the courts and the public defender and the District Attorney's
Office. They don't trust the entire justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who chairs the council's Public
Safety Committee overseeing the LAPD, said the city cannot tolerate
criminals within the police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with the criminality first,'' Miscikowski
said. ``We have to get rid of the corruption in these elite
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Laura Chick said she had raised questions at the
start of the LAPD personnel buildup over the need for greater
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiring all these officers meant more than just getting them
the equipment,'' Chick said. ``We were hiring officers and didn't
have the supervisors in place to train them.''
</P>
<P>
   The full Board of Inquiry report is to be released March 1 to
the Police Commission, which will then conduct its own analysis of
it. The City Council on Tuesday authorized providing whatever funds
are needed by the commission to conduct its review.

VICTORY KEEPS TEXAS ALIVE IN Big 12 RACE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Texas forward Gabe Muoneke justifiably was having a
hard time breathing as last night's pivotal match with Oklahoma
State moved into the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My asthma was acting up, but I wasn't about to tell coach
\RRick\S Barnes to let me sit,'' Muoneke said.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing. Muoneke breathed life into the Longhorns' continuing
hopes for a repeat Big 12 championship, leading the way to a 68-57
victory over the No. 8 Cowboys before an Erwin Center crowd of
15,525. The Longhorns avenged an earlier 73-65 loss in Stillwater.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off the bench for the third consecutive game, Muoneke
scored a game-high 17 points and passed out three assists to pace
No. 17 Texas (18-6) to a record fourth victory over a Top 10
opponent this season and their 10th consecutive victory at home.
The Longhorns are 6-0 at home in conference games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to protect your home court if you're going to win the
title,'' pointed out Texas center Chris Mihm, who recorded his 15th
double-double of the season with 15 points and 16 rebounds. ``This
is a huge game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns pumped their Big 12 record to 9-2 in pulling even
with OSU and staying a game behind leader Iowa State (22-3, 10-1),
which pulled off a big victory at Kansas last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised Iowa State won in Lawrence,'' OSU coach Eddie
Sutton said. ``I guess that means both of us better go up to Ames
and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas is at Iowa State Tuesday; OSU follows on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And as much as his offense was key, Muoneke also contributed to
a defensive effort that held OSU forward Desmond Mason to 12 points
after he had drilled Texas for 30 in the Cowboys' victory last
month. Texas also got another productive game from guard Darren
Kelly, who followed his clutch performance at Missouri Saturday
with a 14-point performance and a good defensive effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas was more aggressive this time,'' said Mason, who hit
four of 13 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns broke from a 29-27 halftime lead to a 48-35
advantage with a 12-2 run, during which Muoneke scored eight of his
13 second-half points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took what the defense gave me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mason singlehandedly brought OSU back by scoring seven points in
a 9-0 run with Muoneke and Kelly on the bench catching a breather.
Muoneke ended the run with a baseline slam and UT inched back up by
10.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton put the Cowboys into a zone to clog the middle after a
timeout with 6:58 to play. Texas scored only three more field
goals, but forward Chris Owens _ a 50 percent free-throw shooter _
hit six of seven from the line to help keep OSU at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Key was Mihm's rebound and follow layup after Owens' only miss
after six in a row with 1:57 left. That gave Texas a 64-55 edge and
OSU could not hit another shot from the floor, scoring only two
more points on a pair from the line by Glendon Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was really good,'' Barnes said of the 41.2 percent
defensive effort. ``It was a great college game. Both teams played
their hearts out and there were no easy baskets at any time.'' nn

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUSTIN _ As basketball arenas go, the Frank Erwin Center has always
been a great place to stage a boat show.
</P>
<P>
   While Duke's Cameron has always had its Crazies, the Drum has
been known to have its Doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   It has seen some good basketball teams, sure _ even championship
teams. But as often as the Longhorns have put together squads that
could threaten anyone in the land, the home floor hasn't exactly
been Cameron Indoor Stadium, or even Phog Allen Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more like a sort of Gracie Allen Fieldhouse, with
all its soft lighting, soothing surroundings, polite applause and
Geritol Generation season-ticket holders hollering at students to
sit down.
</P>
<P>
   But in barreled the No. 8-ranked Oklahoma State Cowboys on
Wednesday night, with old nemesis Eddie Sutton scowling and
prowling along the sideline, first place in the Big 12 potentially
on the line and emotions bubbling over.
</P>
<P>
   The Horns found themselves in the midst of their first truly
large home game in probably two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to tell our guys,'' Texas coach Rick Barnes
said. ``We lose this, we have no chance (at winning the conference
title).''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona game earlier this year? Most Texas fans remember
that day _ Dec. 4 _ for the football loss the Longhorns took from
Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship Game. The wins over DePaul,
Michigan State and Massachusetts? The first two came in Puerto
Rico, the last one on the road. And they were non-conference games
at that.
</P>
<P>
   This one was at home, and the Horns desperately needed it. This
one brought back memories of the Southwest Conference, of Abe
Lemons and Eddie Sutton. Of the kinds of games that fans used to
break down the doors hoping to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could feel the electricity when both teams walked into the
building tonight,'' Barnes said. ``It was a great college
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   It was two Top 25 teams and a potential payback game for a loss
Texas took in Stillwater last month. It was the league's best big
man, Texas' Chris Mihm, and a truly great scorer, OSU's Desmond
Mason.
</P>
<P>
   And it proved to be just what the Longhorns needed, a tense
68-57 affair, but a win that kept Texas in the conference race and
was the best basketball show Austin has seen in quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd was unbelievable tonight,'' said Texas forward Gabe
Muoneke, who came off the bench to be the hero of the night with 17
points on 8-of-12 shooting. ``They picked us up, and we played at a
higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns needed every bit of emotional surge, and if
they're going to have a legitimate shot at winning another Big 12
title, they're going to have to take this energy on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke clearly was the man Wednesday with an eight-point
explosion midway through the second half that broke open the game
and crippled the Cowboys' hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm, doing a sort of Shaq Diesel kind of thing to the middle of
the lane, did the rest. The two Texas big men combined for 32
points and 21 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a chance for us to move right back up top and show what
we could do,'' Mihm said. ``In this conference, if you're going to
expect to win the title, you're going to have to win all your games
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a night for Barnes to circle and perhaps remember
if this season gets even better, which it just might. The old place
showed it still has some rattle left in the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   And the Longhorns showed a 20-2 team that the conference title
remains theirs until someone takes it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'm going to find something wrong about this game
when I look at it on tape,'' Barnes said, ``but when we needed to
make plays, we made plays. It was obviously a big win.''
</P>
<P>
   There remains quite a tough road for the Longhorns in their
title quest, especially next week when they travel to Ames, Iowa,
to take on Iowa State in another showdown.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a team that continues to show it can get the job
done at home and on the road. This is a team that seems to have all
the right ingredients to make a run in the conference and NCAA
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The further we go down the road,'' Muoneke said, ``we're going
to have to keep doing the things we've been doing.''

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Tony Stewart won three events and finished
fourth in the Winston Cup points championship last season, things
no rookie had done before.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The one thing Stewart didn't have much of was competition from
other rookies, but don't expect a runaway winner this year. Stewart
and many other Winston Cup drivers believe the 2000 rookie class is
the best ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, I could be going to some of these guys for advice,''
Stewart said. ``So yeah, I would rate them pretty high. They have
quite a batch of credentials, and they're all here because they
deserve to be here. These guys have been quick in whatever type of
car they were driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven talented rookies are planning to compete in every Winston
Cup event this season, and all hope to be in the field for Sunday's
Daytona 500. They have little in common except for driving skill
and confidence in their ability.
</P>
<P>
   The group includes Dale Earnhardt Jr., Matt Kenseth, Mike Bliss,
Scott Pruett, Dave Blaney, Jeff Fuller and Stacy Compton. All seven
have been winners at other levels of racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the toughest year ever to be the best rookie,''
said Kenseth, who is driving the DeWalt Ford. ``There's always a
lot of pressure being a rookie in Winston Cup, but we have pressure
this year just competing with the other rookies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth and Earnhardt have received most of the attention among
the rookie class. They battled all last season for the Busch Grand
National championship before Earnhardt clinched his second
consecutive title.
</P>
<P>
   Both are in their mid-20s, and both have famous mentors helping
them. Kenseth is being guided by Mark Martin, who is the co-owner
of Kenseth's car with Jack Roush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be with Roush Racing if it wasn't for Mark
Martin,'' Kenseth said. ``He put this whole thing together. I'm
going to rely on him a lot this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt can rely on his father. Junior is seen as the heir to
his famous dad's racing legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a lot to learn,'' Junior said. ``And my dad tells
me I still have some straightening up to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Earnhardt, ``Little E'' to many people in the garage
area, has everything a rookie could hope for in a new team.
Budweiser will put up $50 million over five years to sponsor the
team owned by Earnhardt's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done pretty well for himself,'' Dale Earnhardt said of
his son. ``I try to advise him a little bit, but as far as telling
him to do this or don't do that, the biggest thing I've told him is
don't mess with Daddy out on the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior's success the last two years has drastically changed his
life, making him almost as popular with the fans as his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things I used to do that I just can't do
anymore,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``You learn to stick around your
real friends.''
</P>
<P>
   It might surprise some people to learn that Earnhardt's best
friend is Kenseth. When they are off the track, they don't talk
about racing.
</P>
<P>
   They are more concerned with the rest of the rookie field than
they are with each other. The group includes drivers with a lot
more racing experience than Kenseth or Junior has.
</P>
<P>
   Blaney, 37, is a former World of Outlaws series champion who has
been a Busch driver the previous two years, winning four poles last
season and finishing seventh in the points standings. He joins Bill
Davis Racing as Ward Burton's teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to be a contender in the rookie race,'' Blaney said.
``I don't know if anybody else expects it, but I do. We have the
team to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he thinks Blaney, like Stewart last year, will prove
he is better suited to the higher horsepower of the Winston Cup
cars than the less powerful Busch cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dave is going to surprise some people,'' Davis said.
``I think we are going to see three, four or maybe even five
drivers in contention for the rookie title.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss and Compton, two drivers making the transitions from the
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, also hope to be contenders. A lot of
NASCAR fans in Houston will be rooting for Bliss, who is the driver
of the Conseco Pontiac for A.J. Foyt's new team. Compton is driving
the Kodiak Ford for Melling Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, a veteran Busch driver and the oldest rookie at 42, is
getting more attention these days for his sponsor _ Viagra _ than
his driving skills, but he hopes that will change.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett, 40, is making the transition from CART with new Winston
Cup team owner Cal Wells III. Pruett was the fastest rookie
qualifier at Daytona last weekend with the 10th-best speed overall
at 189.470 mph in the Tide Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems strange to be called a rookie,'' Pruett said. ``I've
raced a long time in a lot of different series and have a lot of
experience, but there is certainly a lot to learn here. And this is
a tough rookie group, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the veteran Winston Cup drivers feel the same way. Jeff
Gordon, the 1993 Rookie of the Year, calls it ``a pretty impressive
class.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bobby Labonte: ``It's an incredible class of rookies.''
</P>
<P>
   The rookie class of 1979 included Dale Earnhardt and Terry
Labonte, but defending series champion Dale Jarrett thinks this one
is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is probably the best rookie class we've ever seen
come into Winston Cup,'' Jarrett said. ``They will be in contention
in a lot of races.''

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ There is one thing about defending a conference
championship.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title is yours until someone takes it away from you.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State has looked like it was capable of winning the Big
12 crown, even looked like the favorite to do so, but the title
still belongs to the Texas Longhorns _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a resounding effort from forward Gabe Muoneke, Texas
got a measure of revenge for an earlier loss in Stillwater with a
68-57 win over Oklahoma State on Wednesday before a season-best
crowd of 15,525 at the Erwin Center.
</P>
<P>
   No. 17 Texas improved to 18-6 overall and 9-2 in Big 12 play to
pull into a second-place tie with the eighth-ranked Cowboys (20-3).
Iowa State, which hosts Texas next week, leads the league with a
10-1 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at them being ranked No. 8 in the country, and we
don't think they were overrated, we just think that if they're No.
8, then we must be No. 7 or No. 9, because the two teams are that
close to each other,'' Muoneke said. ``We think they are one of the
best teams in the nation, and we feel we must be as well. We knew
if we could beat them, we could establish ourselves as one of the
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to show you can win games like this if you want to
make it to the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke finished with 17 points on 8-of-12 shooting to lead
Texas. Chris Mihm added 15 points and 16 rebounds and Darren Kelly
chipped in 14 points for the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke, who has come off the bench the past three games after a
run-in at practice with coach Rick Barnes, took over for a
2{-minute stretch of the second half to lead the Longhorns to the
win.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke had a steal and a long pass downcourt for an assist on a
Kelly dunk, then scored eight consecutive points in a 12-2 run that
gave the Longhorns a commanding 48-35 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got aggressive, and he was getting the ball really
deep, and when he gets the ball down that low you can't really stop
him,'' Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason said of Muoneke.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke said coming off the bench is a challenge for him in his
senior year, but his concern for what is best for the team is more
important than any selfish desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that I love it, but he (Barnes) has been doing
this for a long time and I'm not going to question his decision,''
Muoneke said. ``We're winning, and we won last year. He's come
through for me in every situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said it is Muoneke who is coming through for the
Longhorns in the most important stretch of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was great tonight,'' Barnes said. ``I like him coming off
the bench. I know what we're going to get from him. He changes the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that bothers me is people thinking he's not
starting because of some discipline problem from three games ago,
and that's not the case. People make too much about who's starting,
I think. Gabe's been great _ not good, but great about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who finished with just 12 points, answered the
Muoneke-led run by scoring seven points in a 9-0 blitz to get the
Cowboys back into the game, but Oklahoma State never got closer
than five points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys pulled within 55-50, Muoneke drove the lane
against a 2-3 zone for a scoop layup to make it a seven-point game
with five minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Owens, a 50.5 percent foul shooter entering the game, hit
five of six from the line in the final four minutes to help thwart
the Cowboys' comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Little was decided in the first half, as the two teams slugged
it out with neither taking charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys biggest lead was five points at 17-12, while the
Longhorns' best advantage was a three-point edge of 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Texas took a two-point advantage into the break on Ivan Wagner's
3-pointer with less than 10 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who had 30 points against Texas earlier this season, had
trouble getting free against the Longhorns' pressuring man-to-man
defense. With a variety of Longhorns chasing him, Mason took just
three shots in the first half and finished only 4-for-13 overall
from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desmond didn't play very well, and it's hard for us to win if
he doesn't play well,'' Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton said.
``When your top two scorers, (Joe) Adkins and Mason, go 7-for-25 on
shots, it's going to take you out of the game.''

BRUINS TIE MAPLE LEAFS
</HEADLINE>
 LEAFS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ It was the perversely perfect defining moment of this
misbegotten Bruins season: Rob Tallas, coach Pat Burns's gamble in
goal who had turned in a heroic, if adventuresome, performance,
skated to the bench 40 seconds into overtime with his reward for
his night's work, a fractured finger, spitting blood onto the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life in the breakdown lane. Even when the Bruins light a
spark for themselves, it explodes in their faces. That was the
unfortunate dividend to an otherwise heartening 3-3 tie with the
Northeast Division-leading Toronto Maple Leafs Wednesday night
before 19,304 fans at the Air Canada Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas, getting his first start since losing Jan. 11 to the
Leafs, 3-2, was as responsible as anyone for salvaging the vital
point, even if the belly flop and the desperation lunge were
integral parts of his 27-save repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   His celebration party consisted of an X-ray in the dressing room
while the game was still going on. It confirmed what he knew the
moment he stabbed Bryan Berard's slot blast with his glove hand: He
has a split fracture of the third finger on his left hand _ the
same finger whose tip was nearly severed Nov. 24 in Nashville and
required immediate surgery to be reattached.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the crack right on the picture,'' said Tallas, who
was wearing a blue splint on the finger. He will have a cast fitted
for it, and hopes to suit up for the Bruins' next game Monday in
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play happened so quickly, the puck was loose in front, and
he just one-timed it. I saw a flashback of Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
   And no more action in Toronto. But Tallas wasn't thinking of his
own misfortune as trainer Don Del Negro assisted him to the locker
room: ``I said to the trainer, `I'm just praying for Byron, because
this isn't fair.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, regular goalie Byron Dafoe was supposed to be getting
the night off after starting 15 straight games, including losses to
the New York Rangers (5-2) and Florida Panthers (5-1) last weekend.
That prompted Burns to turn at least for one night to Tallas in
hopes of trying something _ anything _ to resuscitate a team that
has plunged to 11th place in the Eastern Conference, which has room
for only eight in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, who had acknowledged before the game, ``Obviously, I
haven't been doing the job lately,'' had intended to use the
respite to get another vantage point in hopes that would help solve
his problems.
</P>
<P>
   The vacation ended with 4:20 left in OT as Dafoe immediately
donned his mask and hopped over the boards, having been transformed
from spectator to closer by one lightning Berard windup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell Robbie was in serious pain and I knew right away
I was going in,'' said Dafoe. ``I honestly felt quite relaxed. I
was only going in for four minutes. It wasn't like I had to stand
on my head for two periods.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that Dafoe took more drinks of water (2)
than the Leafs took shots at him (1). But that shot was a bullet.
At 1:15, Igor Korolev swooped in alone and launched a devilish
wrister that Dafoe went to his knees to smother. That was it for
the Leafs and Dafoe. A job well done, however briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every point is huge right now,'' Dafoe said. ``We'd obviously
prefer to have 2, but at least we weren't the team that gave up the
lead this time.''
</P>
<P>
   No, that dubious honor belonged to Toronto, which admittedly was
unaccustomed to being in front. The Leafs hadn't been ahead once in
losing their previous four games. But second-period goals by
Nikolai Antropov (3:55) and Yanic Perreault (16:27) had erased a
2-1 first-period Bruins lead achieved on tallies by Joe Thornton
(6:16) and Shawn Bates (16:50) sandwiched around one by Boston
castaway Dmitri Khristich (16:50).
</P>
<P>
   Maple Leafs All-Star goalie Curtis Joseph, who had revealed to
the Toronto media Tuesday that he was playing hurt _ ``I have a
bruised ego'' _ seemed about to find the cure.
</P>
<P>
   But with 13:28 left in regulation, Hal Gill passed across the
Toronto blue line to fellow defenseman Kyle McLaren, who wristed a
shot that appeared to be headed wide of the net.
</P>
<P>
   But center Andre Savage _ who had nearly been decapitated by a
Danny Markov high stick in the first period _ was poised in the
slot and thrust out his stick, redirecting the puck just past
Joseph's stick side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a good tip on it,'' said Savage. ``And even though we
didn't get the win, this is a positive we can build on.''
</P>
<P>
   That's if they can avoid dwelling on their wretched luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens,'' sighed Burns.
</P>
<P>
   It must be for a reason. Torture, perhaps?

TRYING TO HANDICAP SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MADNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Which Southern California team has the easiest
path to the NCAA Tournament? That's easy: Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to their record, schedule and power ratings, the Waves
are close to securing an at-large bid. If only UCLA and USC had it
so easy...
</P>
<P>
   With 3 weeks until Selection Sunday, here's a look at the local
contenders:
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine: The Waves are 19-6 overall and 9-1 in the WCC (tied
with Gonzaga). In itself, the record won't excite members of the
NCAA Tournament Selection committee. But the Waves will get bonus
points for a bold nonconference schedule (Kansas, Auburn, UCLA).
They are 26th in the Ratings Percentage Index, which closely
approximates the NCAA's power ratings ahead of Michigan State, Ohio
State, Utah, UCLA and Gonzaga and they're 33rd in the latest
Sagarin power ratings. (Teams in the 30s are usually good bets for
at-large bids.)
</P>
<P>
   The Waves can't afford a late-season collapse; a loss to Loyola
Marymount, San Diego or St. Mary's would crush their power rating.
But if they take care of regular-season business and finish 23-6,
they probably won't need to win the WCC tournament to get a bid.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA chances: Very good.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge: Despite victories over Oregon and Fresno
State, the Matadors have one path to the NCAA Tournament: They must
win the Big Sky tournament. With power ratings of 114th (Sagarin)
and 125th (RPI), they have no chance for an at-large bid.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, they're running out of time. At 14-7 overall and 6-4
in the Big Sky (third place), they trail first-place Eastern
Washington by two games with six to play. Don't forget: The
regular- season champ hosts the postseason tournament.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA chances: Slim.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State: The Beach might be the best team in Southern
California right now, but it has one of the toughest paths to the
tournament. The 49ers are 16-4 overall and 8-1 in the Big West.
They beat USC early in the season and had won 15 in a row until
last week's loss to Utah State.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a weak nonconference schedule (two non-Division I
wins: Cal State Dominguez Hills and Cal State Monterey Bay) the
49ers are 74th in the RPI and 46th in Sagarin. That's too low for
an at-large invitation, so they'll need the automatic bid that goes
to the winner of the Big West Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA chances: Solid.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA: Remember how soft the schedule seemed after early-season
victories over Iona, Fairfield and Morgan State? As expected, it
got tougher so much tougher, in fact, that it now stands as the
best in the Pac-10 and one of the top 10 in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins win five of their last eight to reach the 18-win
plateau, they're in the tournament, no questions asked. If they
finish 17-13 overall and 8-10 in the conference, the schedule just
might get them one of the last at-large bids. Their power ratings
are solid (32nd in the RPI and 39th in the Sagarin), and they have
three good wins (DePaul, Purdue and North Carolina).
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why the Bruins are in this predicament. The
losses to Colorado State and Washington are as inexcusable now as
they were at the time.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA chances: Decent.
</P>
<P>
   USC: Based solely on what they've done since Jan.1, the Trojans
(13-9, 6-4) would be in good shape. They've beaten Arizona and UCLA
in conference play, and they're one game out of third place.
</P>
<P>
   But their 7-5 nonconference record with no quality wins
</P>
<P>
   could keep them out of the tournament. They're 35th in the
Sagarin but 63rd in the RPI. In order to reach the magic 18-win
plateau, the Trojans must finish 11-7 in conference.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA chances: Decent.
</P>
<P>
   Selection Sunday preview: Cincinnati, Stanford, Arizona, Duke
and Michigan State are competing for the four No.1 seeds. Michigan
State has the least-impressive record, but the Spartans played a
brutal schedule and have the Big Ten tournament for a last-second
power-ratings boost.
</P>
<P>
   Teams competing for the No.2 and 3 seeds are Tennessee, Auburn,
Florida, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio State, Texas, Oklahoma State and
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Western Athletic Conference nor the newly formed
Mountain West have automatic bids. That's one less at-large berth
to go around.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Big East and SEC will fill
most of the at-large slots, but it doesn't appear any of them will
get more than six bids. The Atlantic-10 and Conference USA could
get just two or three bids each.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa is for real. So are Iowa State and Louisiana State. All
three could be fourth- or fifth-seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 definitely will get three bids (Arizona, Stanford and
Oregon). It should get four, and it might get five.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Pac-10: Commissioner Tom Hansen, working on behalf of
seven constituents, continues to push for a postseason tournament.
Problem is, his marquee schools, Arizona, Stanford and UCLA, are
opposed for academic, financial and competitive reasons. The
postseason tournament is a constitutional issue, so eight schools
must be in favor....
</P>
<P>
   Arizona beat Washington State last weekend for the 30th
consecutive game, a streak that dates to Jan. 1986. It's the
longest intraconference streak in the nation. The longest
nonconference streak belongs to Marquette, which has defeated
Wisconsin-Milwaukee 34 consecutive times.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has as many canceled flights this season (four) as
losses....
</P>
<P>
   Stanford power forward Mark Madsen on his rebounding: ``I'm
trying to be more aggressive going to the glass.'' That's like
Vince Carter saying he wants to jump higher....
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for the stretch run, Oregon gets David Jackson, a
transfer from Utah, back from knee surgery. Jackson was expected to
be the Ducks' sixth man when the season began....
</P>
<P>
   Trying to make his team tougher, Washington coach Bob Bender
ordered a 6 a.m. practice Monday....
</P>
<P>
   And finally: Stanford's field-goal percentage defense (33.8) is
on an NCAA-record pace.

DUCKS WIN IN OT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Guy Hebert has won more than his share of games for
the Mighty Ducks. For seven years the diminutive goalie has been a
tower of strength for a team that hasn't always provided him with
quality support.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night before 12,956 at The Pond it was the Ducks
who were forced to try and win one for their goalie. And thanks to
Oleg Tverdovsky that is just what they did. The Anaheim defenseman
combined with Paul Kariya for a breathtaking goal at 3:20 of
overtime to give the Ducks a 6-5 victory over the Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrik Olausson's power play goal at 14:00 of the third period
tied the game, 5-5, setting the stage for Kariya and Tverdovsky to
work their magic.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya made several nifty moves in the neutral zone and left a
drop pass for Tverdovsky, who used a brilliant inside-out move to
get around Daryl Shannon and easily beat goalie Fred Brathwaite who
didn't know where Tverdovsky was heading.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredible goal ... I've never seen a goal like
that,'' said Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg, a man not given
exagerations. ``Paul made about eight moves, Oleg made about eight
moves. Two great players made a play to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oleg came off the bench like he was shot out of a rocket, I
figured it was going in one net or another,'' said Hartsburg with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was Tverdovsky's eighth of the season, gave the Ducks
their second overtime win of the season and moved Anaheim
(25-26-8-1) within four points of seventh-place Colorado and kept
it five back of Edmonton, San Jose and the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably my best goal ever,'' said Tverdovsky. ``I
scored some like that in juniors ... but not on this level.''
</P>
<P>
   But the defensemen seemed more impressed by the way the Ducks
kept fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every point is crucial, we need every point,'' he said.
``Tonight we never gave up and we got rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks did their best to make things comfortable for Hebert,
giving him three leads to work with. But each time the crowd or
team looked like they might be able breath easy he let another
questionable goal in.
</P>
<P>
   One bounced off his glove, another off his stick and a third
went off his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim took a 4-3 lead into the third period only to have Jason
Wiemer bounce a shot off Hebert's shoulder into the net 33 seconds
after play began.
</P>
<P>
   Weimer then put the Flames on top with a power play goal at 9:28
. The shot bounced off Hebert's leg pad, but he really had little
chance on the play after two quick passes by Phil Housley and Marc
Savard got the puck to Weimer in prime scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   tainly wasn't Hebert's best night, but nobody was ready to
point fingers, especially after such an emotional victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't Guy's strongest game, but we on the game and that's
all that matters,'' said Kariya, who had a goal and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   Weimer's second goal looked like it might doom Anaheim's
chances, but after several close calls on goal-mouth scrambles, the
Ducks got just what they needed -- a power play of their own and
Olausson converted with the help of a Matt Cullen screen.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second power play goal of the game for the Ducks who
have scored power play goals in nine consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   The power play had given them a 4-3 lead with 28.5 seconds left
in the second period when Olausson's point shot bounced off Steve
Rucchin in the slot.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks won the battle of the bounces in the first period even
though it was Calgary that opened the scoring on Clarke Wilm's goal
at 8:26.
</P>
<P>
   Just 15 seconds after the Flames had taken the lead the Ducks
tied the game when Kevin Haller scored his second goal of the
season and first since the Ducks' home opener on Oct. 8. The
defenseman's shot from the left point went through traffic and
appeared to deflected off a Calgary defender and through
Brathwaite's pads at 8:41.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames recorded nine of the game's first 11 shots, but the
Ducks took the lead at 13:54 thanks to a good bounce and some
hustle by Paul Kariya. The Anaheim captain just barely held the
puck in the Ducks zone before he spun and flipped it toward the
net. The puck hit Housley's skate and bounced right to Rucchin, who
beat Brathwaite from the left circle for his 12th goal of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne also assisted on the play, extending his scoring
streak to 12 games and recording the 700th in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning from a staph infection in his left ankle Rucchin
has scored in nine of 11 games, recording five goals and 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was his best game of the year,'' said Hartsburg. ''He
played with the passion we need and he was a force each time he was
on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilm's goal began the strange series of the goals, when his
deflection hit the post. The center raised his arms thinking he had
scored and everybody seemed to pause just a moment. That split
second hestation was all that Wilm needed to knock home the rebound
for his ninth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary's second and third goals weren't so much strange as they
were downright discouraging. Anaheim dominated most of the second
period and nearly took a 3-1 lead on an early power play. Even the
Ducks much-maligned penalty killing unit, ranked 26th in the NHL,
easily killed off Calgary's 43-second two-man advantage and was
within five seconds of killing off the rest of the penalty time
when Hebert whiffed on Robyn Regeher's soft shot from the right
circle at 5:04.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's No. 1 line combined to give the Ducks a 3-2 lead at
10:15 when Rucchin did the dirty work along the boards, Selanne
provided the centering pass and Kariya the lightning-fast finish
from the slot for his 35th goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   After another good penalty killing effort Braithwaite stopped
Jeff Nielsen and Kariya on breakaways -- the Ducks' momentum
stalled again when Hebert let a soft shot by Cale Hulse bounce off
his stick and Jarome Iginla scored at 17:02.

   As Republicans John McCain and George W. Bush face off in South
Carolina, where the primary is only two days away, the Campaign
Countdown is in full swing. Laura Ingraham checks in this week with
a candid look at front-runner Bush's strategy _ or lack of same _
in pursuit of the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' Ingraham writes, ``Bush is where Bill Clinton was
in 1992, when he decided to appear on `60 Minutes' to face
persistent questions about his marital infidelity. He's where his
dad was in 1988, after he lost the Iowa caucuses and Bob Dole was
threatening to win the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, this is his moment of crisis, when he will either
rise to the challenge or fall into the heap of past would-be
nominees who simply weren't ready for political prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush is to recapture the mantle of the hard-charging,
principled, top-of-his-game front-runner,'' the author and MSNBC
host continues, ``he'll need to look inward. The Washington
Establishment, campaign consultants, his parents and Christian
conservatives are useless at this stage. Money and endorsements
can't help him now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person who can stabilize this suddenly shaky campaign
is that dynamic scrapper who dared to take on popular Democratic
Gov. Anne Richards of Texas and won, a committed, no-holds-barred
campaigner named George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingraham joins former Democratic vice-presidential nominee
Geraldine Ferraro _ her counterpart on Campaign Countdown, The New
York Times Syndicate's rotating weekly campaign-commentary column _
in calling it the way she sees it, telling it like it is about
liberals and conservatives alike.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro and Ingraham offer the kind of timely, hard-hitting
insider insights that your readers will want in the upcoming
election season, just in time for what is shaping up as the most
exciting presidential election in a generation.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Seeking alternatives to reparations
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it is because affirmative action is being dismantled by
the Reaganized and Bushified federal courts that an old idea _
compensation for the damage done to African-Americans over the 350
years of slavery and segregation _ is stirring again.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action opened long-blocked opportunities to a
shunned people who had been wounded and burdened uniquely. But
affirmative action is being called off before it can complete and
secure its ends, victim of a phony ``colorblindness'' whose real
blindness is to the manifest persistence of racism and its harms.
America the Good has never been much of a match for America the
Easily Distracted.
</P>
<P>
   So the case for reparations is being made anew not only but
chiefly by Randall Robinson, whose TransAfrica led a reluctant U.S.
government into policies that honorably helped to end apartheid in
South Africa. Robinson argues powerfully that black America remains
undermined by the inherited consequences of economic deprivation,
social dislocation and persistent racial abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a debt compounded over centuries that should,
Randall says, literally be paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't gonna happen. That's simply too big a can of worms for the
nation to dare open. Even to pry at it credibly would risk a
political recoil whose likely effects would further damage the
claimants.
</P>
<P>
   But the untenability of the idea does not mean that it isn't a
useful lens through which to view and understand _ and
understanding, to mitigate _ the debilities our tormented racial
history has left us.
</P>
<P>
   Since black America was finally freed by the Voting Rights Act
of 1965 _ the real emancipation _ it has narrowed gaps with white
America in education and income. But the gaps are not near being
closed and as long as they linger the disparities rack up
continuing social costs all Americans pay.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways, if we will have them, to hurry the lines
together.
</P>
<P>
   We could, for instance, rebuild the devastating criminal justice
system from the ground up to remove systemic racial inequities that
are producing black convicts in grotesque disproportion to black
crime. Education, much invoked but little honored as a remedy,
really could be a big part of the solution if we would treat its
failures as catastrophes like floods and tornadoes _ that is, with
emergency crews and aid, and cost be damned.
</P>
<P>
   And if not with broad reparations, then where direct harm can be
shown, financial compensation should be due. Fisk University's Race
Relations Institute, in an intriguing new project, is looking for
black families that can document they were forced from land or
property by threats or other illegal means, going back to the
1870s. Lawyers can't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   The real Martin Luther King Jr. _ not the sappy version we have
now for rote and easy admiration _ was toying in his last years
with schemes for a major redistribution of wealth. America, 135
years after the Civil War, is still holding out on those 40 acres
and a mule.

 &HT;    Roger, Susan, Springsteen and me
 &HT;    By Jeff Herrin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ We are a middle-age gang of jukebox
graduates and Duke Street Kings; Spanish Johnnys and late Juliets;
tramps like us and hey-Rosie-wontcha-come-out-tonights.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us are bald. Some of us are divorced. Not too many of us
pass for skinny any more.
</P>
<P>
   But in the right setting, under the right stars, an amazing
force takes hold of us with the opening notes of ``Tenth Avenue
Freeze Out.'' We're on our feet - 20,000 of us - singing the horn
parts. Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doooooooooooooh! One of
the most thrilling, godawfulest sounds I ever hope to hear.
</P>
<P>
   And I realize, as I look at these words, that there will be
hundreds of Rocky Mount citizens, thousands of North Carolinians,
1.2 billion Chinese who could read these paragraphs and wonder,
``What in the name of Hurricane Floyd is this guy going on about?''
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few who will simply nod their heads, roll down
the windows, let the wind blow back their hair. And those are the
ones who will understand right away the gratitude of Roger, a
history teacher who stood before me in a New Jersey parking lot
last summer, ready to trade a lung for what I was handing him:
</P>
<P>
   Admit One. Continental Arena. Section 114; Row 26; Seat 15.
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.
</P>
<P>
   There's a trace of lunacy in the fuel tank when an otherwise
mind-its-own-business couple drives eight hours in hopes of finding
two tickets to a show that sold out faster than I could write this
paragraph. But as Susan and I frequently told ourselves
(particularly after pulling onto the New Jersey Turnpike),
sometimes you have to do something crazy just to remind yourself
that you're still alive.
</P>
<P>
   I think Bruce would understand. I know Roger did.
</P>
<P>
   He had been No. 96 in a line of people waiting for a handful of
unclaimed tickets that went on sale the afternoon of the July 20
show. I was No. 34.
</P>
<P>
   Susan and I had vowed to avoid eye contact, maintain low
profiles, pretend we were French ... anything to keep the world
from knowing we were Southerners in the Land of Youse Guyz. But
much of Springsteen's music centers on the ties that bind. And six
hours of standing in a sweltering parking lot gets everyone
drinking from the same water bottle at one point or another.
</P>
<P>
   So ... Hi, Rog.
</P>
<P>
   He knew college basketball, loved Springsteen and needed a seat
in the house. How do you turn away a guy like that?
</P>
<P>
   I took his money, entered the Promised Land and bought three at
the window. The last-minute ticket allotment ran dry well before
No. 96 could have made it to the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Susan and I had found ourselves a new brother.
</P>
<P>
   It's a difficult obsession to explain. Springsteen put his hooks
in us in college, when so much of his music dealt with the
struggles we all face in growing up and finding out who we are.
</P>
<P>
   On a night in 1980 that now seems pretty darn close to magic, an
awkward college kid (that would be me) tried against all odds to
tell a girl how he really felt about her. I had all the grace of a
drowning man, but I somehow touched the life buoy of our guy's
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' I said after a long spell of flailing in water
over my head, ``there's this thing Bruce Springsteen wrote ...
`Thunder Road' ... he goes, `I know you've been hungry for words
that I ain't spoken, but tonight we'll be free. And all our
promises will be broken.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the goofiest moments of my life, but she stayed
with me anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So when tickets went on sale last weekend for Springsteen's
April 21-22 concerts in Charlotte and Raleigh, I tweaked my Web
browser, hit the speed dial, and somehow came up with seats at both
shows.
</P>
<P>
   I did it for a glimpse of my youth and for two more nights of
the best rock 'n' roll on the planet. I did it for Roger and for
all the tramps like us who will never shake this mania.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly I did it for Susan and me, for the promises we've
found and made on our own. Sometimes you have to do something crazy
just to remind yourself that you're still alive.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDs: This is File 1 of 2
</P>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call (404) 222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the large amount of money that Steve Forbes spent on his
presidential campaign tax deductible?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. IRS spokesman Mark Green explained that amounts incurred
by an individual seeking public office aren't deductible as
business expenses. The same goes for re-election campaign expenses
for an officeholder. Forbes was reported to have spent a total of
some $66 million on his campaigns in 1996 and this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Also not deductible, by the way, are expenses for the support
of, or opposition to, any candidate for public office. This means
that contributions, gifts, or any other amount paid for
``participation or intervention'' in any political campaign on
behalf of any candidate for public office cannot be claimed as a
deduction. This includes donations to a political party, committee,
group or candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A news magazine recently reported that Sally Hemings was a
half-sister of Thomas Jefferson's wife. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: It has been reported often that Hemings was the illegitimate
half-sister of Jefferson's deceased wife, Martha, the offspring of
a relationship between John Wayles and Elizabeth ``Betty'' Hemings,
a slave. Wayles was the father of Martha Wayles, who married
Jefferson. When Wayles died, Sally Hemings became Jefferson's
property when he inherited the Wayles estate in 1774.
</P>
<P>
   Details about Sally Hemings can be found at libraries. Among the
resources: ``Black Women in America/An Historical Encyclopedia''
and ``Notable Black American Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: An author in Britain named Irving sued an Emory professor and
her publisher for calling him a ``holocaust revisionist.'' The
trial was covered extensively for some days, then disappeared from
the news. What's the status of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The trial of historical writer David Irving's libel lawsuit
against Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt ended its fifth
week on Feb. 10. It is expected to continue until late March.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has been presenting a series of witnesses to
challenge Irving's merits as an historian, and to attack his
honesty as a writer. Under English libel law, attorneys
representing Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin Press, must prove
the truth of assertions contained in a book by Lipstadt that Irving
denied conventional accounts of the Holocaust and manipulated
historical facts to support his position.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt's book, ``Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on
Truth and Memory,'' was published in Britain in 1994. Irving says
the book misrepresented his position, damaged his reputation, and
generated waves of hatred against him. Lipstadt's lawyers accuse
him of being a liar and a falsifier of history.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In what years were the Susan B. Anthony coins produced for
general circulation?
</P>
<P>
   A: 1979-81, plus an uncirculated coin set in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After a commercial airplane crashes, and the flight number is
reported so often that it becomes etched in people's minds, are the
airlines required to retire that number?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the Federal Aviation Administration and the Air
Transport Association, there's no regulation requiring airlines to
retire numbers falling into that category, such as TWA 800. But
Diana Cronan of the Washington-based ATA said it's typical for an
airline to stop using a recognizable flight number ``after any
high-profile accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What ever became of Lenny Skutnik, the man who jumped into
the icy waters of the Potomac River in an attempt to save
passengers in the early-'80s crash of an Air Florida flight? He was
singled out by President Reagan in a State of the Union address,
but I haven't heard anything about him since.
</P>
<P>
   A: At last report, Skutnik was still working at the same job he
had at the Congressional Budget Office in Washington when the crash
occurred on Jan. 13,1982.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Skutnik was on his way to his home in Lorton, Va.
As he neared the crash site, he saw a woman, later identified as a
flight attendant, in the river. She appeared to be losing her grip
on a rescue line. He jumped into the frigid water and dragged her
to safety.
</P>
<P>
   His act of heroism didn't go unnoticed. His biggest moment in
the spotlight came less than two weeks later, during Reagan's first
State of the Union address, when Reagan was discussing heroes. ``We
don't have to turn to our history books for heroes. They're all
around us,'' he said, recounting Skutnik's lifesaving deed. Skutnik
was in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last year with the Washington Post, Skutnik said
the crash rescue incident, and the mention by Reagan, didn't change
his life. ``I got caught up in the moment, but I knew it would
eventually be over,'' he said. ``At first ... I had no control over
it. But then I got back to work, back to normal, and things didn't
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Delta Air Lines has restored an old DC-3 prop
plane that had been in its fleet years and years ago. Can the
public buy a ride on it?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. As Delta has explained previously, Ship 41, as it's
called, is being used only for major air shows and Delta-sponsored
events _ not for commercial or sightseeing flights.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Super Bowl Sunday next year is Jan. 28. When and how can fans
enter the lottery to try and get tickets?
</P>
<P>
   A: As you know, most Super Bowl tickets go to corporate sponsors
and other companies and individuals related to the business side of
the game. Another allotment is set aside for the competing teams. A
small percentage _ a National Football League spokesman wouldn't
specify exactly how many _ goes to the public through a random
drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 Super Bowl will be played in Tampa. Anyone wanting to
get into the pool of potential applicants should send a certified
postcard with name, address and telephone number to: NFL Lottery,
280 Park Ave., New York, NY 10017. The deadline is June 1. Those
whose cards are chosen will be notified ``around the first of
November,'' the NFL spokesman said. Price information will be
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an Internet site where I can look up Sen. John
McCain's voting record?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Web site of the non-partisan organization Project Vote
Smart _ www.vote-smart.org _ is a good place to start for voting
record information on any U.S. senator or House member.
</P>
<P>
   It displays a map of the United States. When you click on the
state you're interested in (Arizona, obviously, for McCain), you'll
find a wealth of data. Votes over a varying period on many issues _
such as affirmative action, gun issues, foreign aid, senior issues,
welfare and many more _ can be accessed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV commentator referred to the medal just awarded to Alfred
Rascon as the Congressional Medal of Honor. I thought it was just
the Medal of Honor. Who is right?
</P>
<P>
   A: You are. The proper name of the highest military decoration
that the United States grants to members of its armed forces is
simply the Medal of Honor. But the word ``Congressional''
frequently is added because the medal is presented by a high
official ``in the name of the Congress of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Rascon shielded men from grenade blasts in Vietnam 34 years ago,
but because of apparent administrative snafus, only now has he been
honored with the medal. It was approved by Defense Secretary
William Cohen in November and awarded to Rascon on Tuesday at the
White House by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose? Some time
ago I read that it was bought and moved by barge from California to
Oregon. Is it on display now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not yet. The Hughes Flying Boat HK-1 is still in pieces, but
is expected to be reassembled in stages and put on display, along
with 40-50 other vintage aircraft, in early 2001. The Spruce Goose
will be the centerpiece of a museum under construction at the Capt.
Michael King Smith Evergreen Educational Institute in McMinnville,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Thompson, spokesman for the facility, said workers hope to
start putting the Spruce Goose in place in August or September. The
fuselage first will be placed in a 7-foot pit, after which the
wings, and then the tail, will be attached. Other aircraft will be
placed around the gigantic HK-1, while others will be suspended
from the museum's superstructure.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the museum can be found online at
http://sprucegoose.org.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in obtaining a copy of President Clinton's
2001 budget. How do I get one?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2001,
and related Office of Management and Budget documents can be
purchased at any Government Printing Office bookstore. One is in
Atlanta (999 Peachtree St. NE, Suite 120; telephone 404-347-1900).
The documents are priced separately: $38 for the budget; $72 for
the appendix; $54 for analytical perspectives; $28 for historical
tables; $3.75 for A Citizen's Guide to the Federal Budget, Fiscal
Year 2001; $3.25 for The Budget System and Concepts, Fiscal Year
2001; and $17 for the budget on CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to buy it, you may be able to view the
material at a public library, said Linda Schimmel of Congressional
Budget Office Publications. Budget documents also can be downloaded
from the Internet at www.gpo.gov/usbudget.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Don McLean's song ``American Pie'' has been in the news
recently because of a remake by Madonna. Beyond the generally
understood explanation that the lyrics are about the early days of
rock and roll, what do the words mean? For example, who are ``the
father, son and the holy ghost''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Numerous interpretations have been offered about the 1971
song's lyrics. Many Web sites exist that attempt to explain it. One
_ www.americanpie2000.com/americanpie/ _ lists this as its
interpretation of the line in Verse 6:
</P>
<P>
   ``And the three men I admire most The Father Son and Holy
Ghost'' refers to Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper (J.P. Richardson) and
Richie Valens.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Web site explains, McLean has never provided an
explanation of the meaning of ``American Pie,'' which has added to
the song's mystery.
</P>
<P>
   This interpretation suggests that the entire song is a tribute
to Holly and a commentary on how rock and roll music changed in the
years since his death in 1959. In that view, McLean is lamenting
the lack of ``danceable'' good-time party music in rock and roll
and, in part, is attributing that lack to the absence of Buddy
Holly, et. al.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative explanation, on a different Web site, says McLean
was a Catholic, and Verse 6 deals with religion and godless acts.
So if you accept that, the words refer to the traditional Trinity
of Christian theology.
</P>
<P>
   A search engine such as Yahoo can link you to several resources
for ``American Pie.'' That way, you can take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to visit cemeteries where famous people, such as
Buddy Holly and Richie Valens, are buried. Is there a book with
that sort of information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several books with such information should be readily
available at libraries or bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books in Print (1999-2000)'' lists these titles, for example:
``Who Lies Where: A Guide to Famous Graves'' by Michael Kerrigan
(Trafalgar Square Publishing Co.); ``Discovering Famous Graves'' by
Lynn F. Pearson (Shire Publications); ``Final Curtain _ Deaths of
Noted Movie and TV Personalities'' by Everett Grant Jarvis (Carol
Publishing Group); and ``Final Curtain: Eternal Resting Places of
Stars, Celebrities, Moguls, Misers, Misfits &AMP; Their Stories'' by
Margaret Burk and Gary Hudson (Seven Locks Press).
</P>
<P>
   Some information is very specific. For example, ``Final Curtain
_ Deaths of Noted Movie and TV Personalities'' shows that Valens is
buried at Missions Hills Cemetery in Mission Hills, Calif., Section
C, at Curb No. 247, three rows in. It doesn't list Holly's burial
place, but the Buddy Holly Center in Lubbock, Texas, confirmed that
he's buried in the City of Lubbock Cemetery. Holly was born in
Lubbock.

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call (404) 222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When airline flights are long and nonstop, such as 16 hours
between Atlanta and South Africa, how does it work with the cockpit
crew? Are there regulations about how long they can be at the
controls?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. International carriers are bound by the regulations of
their respective countries, according to the Montreal-based
International Civil Aviation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the new South African Airways flights to and from
Atlanta, two sets of captains operate the aircraft on shifts, said
airline spokeswoman Ann Gillespie. She added that South African
Airways follows FAA guidelines, since the aircraft operate into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   FAA regulations specify that flight crews can fly for no more
than eight hours before they must be relieved, said agency
spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. Usually, she said, a crew member flies
the aircraft for several hours, then rests in facilities that are
required to be available while someone else is at the controls.
After resting, the first person returns to duty. The eight hours is
``actual flying time,'' by the way, and doesn't include preflight
preparations, Bergen said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it still possible to purchase official programs from the
Atlanta Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, as long as supplies last. The Atlanta Super Bowl Host
Committee suggests checking an online source,
www.officialstuff.com, which as of Feb. 9 indicated programs were
available for $19.95 (shipping and handling included). A spokesman
at National Football League headquarters in New York said programs
also can be ordered by calling 1-877-NFL-SHOP (1-877-635-7467).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported how to convert temperatures from
Celsius to Fahrenheit. Is there a similar formula for determining
wind chill?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but it's complex. A simpler way is to check a chart that
has temperatures in Fahrenheit ranging from, say, 45 degrees above
zero to 45 below, relating them to wind velocity.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the formula is complicated is that the wind chill
equivalents don't simply double if, for instance, the actual
temperature is steady but the wind speed doubles. Say the air
temperature is 25 degrees F and the wind velocity is 10 mph; the
numerical table puts the wind chill equivalent temperature at 10.
If the temperature is the same (25) and the wind velocity is
doubled to 20 mph, the wind chill equivalent is 3 below zero. If
the temperature is 25 and the wind velocity is 30 mph, the wind
chill equivalent is 10 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
   A chart can be found in World Book Encyclopedia, available at
any library. Look under ``Wind chill.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: On a recent episode of the TV game show ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' the name of the Michelin mascot was identified as
Bibendum. We thought it was simply ``the Michelin tire man.'' What
is the origin of the name Bibendum, and how was it chosen as the
mascot?
</P>
<P>
   A: The genesis of the name Bibendum came in February 1893, at
the conference of the Society of Civil Engineers of Paris, when
Andre Michelin introduced the expression that was to become a
Michelin motto: ``The tire drinks obstacles.'' A year later, at the
Exposition Universelle et Coloniale at Lyon, France, Andre and his
brother, Edouard, noticed a pile of tires of varying sizes. Edouard
remarked to Andre that if the pile of tires had arms, it would look
like a man. Thus was the idea planted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1897, illustrator Marius Rossillon, who went by the pseudonym
O'Galop, showed the Michelin brothers several ideas for publicity.
One was a sketch showing a drinker raising his arm, with the motto,
``Nunc est bibendum'' (``It's time to drink''), after a verse from
Horace. The line reminded Andre of the phrase ``The tire drinks
obstacles.'' So he ordered a poster from O'Galop, who created one
the following year using a character composed of tires and
repeating the ``Nunc est bibendum'' motto.
</P>
<P>
   The association was complete when, several months later, a race
car driver spotted Andre Michelin and shouted, ``There's
Bibendum.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently on the selection process for candidates
for the TV program ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Can you give
me similar information about getting on ``Wheel of Fortune''?
</P>
<P>
   A: A new system called the ``Wheelmobile,'' which will visit
several cities each month, is in the works. There's no schedule yet
for when and where it will be going, said a show spokeswoman. Her
advice: Watch local affiliates on which the program is broadcast,
and they will announce locations and schedules for the Wheelmobile.
</P>
<P>
   Once locations are established, people who want to be an
audience member or a contestant can go there and enter their names
and telephone numbers into a database. Names then will be chosen
randomly.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to make the system more equitable for people
nationwide, rather than having contestants and audience members
basically coming from the show's home base in Southern California,
the spokeswoman said. She added that nothing will happen soon,
because the show is scheduled to go on hiatus for a couple of
months.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the recent spell of cold and ice in Georgia damaged the
Vidalia onion crop?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lovers of the sweet onions will be happy to hear that the
worst of the harsh weather bypassed the exclusive growing area. A
spokeswoman at Morris Farms in east-central Georgia said a few
onions may have suffered, but the majority of the crop is expected
to be fine. She said the onions should be in grocery stores in late
April, and will be available through June, or even longer if kept
in cold storage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports indicate that oil found on a Russian freighter
originated from Iraq. How was that conclusion reached?
</P>
<P>
   A: The vessel carried a load of gas oil, a refined product often
used as diesel fuel. Samples were flown to the U.S. Customs Service
Laboratory in San Francisco, the routine procedure in cases of
suspected smuggling in the Persian Gulf. The sample's chemical
signature then was compared to those in a library of 3,000
reference samples collected worldwide. A positive match showed that
the tanker's cargo had originated as crude oil from an Iraqi well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We lost two pine and five maple trees as a result of ice
storms. They broke in two, so must be removed. Since none caused
damage to my home, my insurance company won't reimburse me. I have
a bid for $4,000 from a tree-removal company to remove the wood. Is
that deductible as a casualty loss on my income tax return?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some of it may be deductible, but several factors must be
taken into account, said IRS spokesman Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's a ``$100 rule,'' that must be applied, meaning
you reduce the figure to $3,900. Then you must apply another rule,
which requires calculating 10 percent of your adjusted gross
income. If that is less than $3,900, the resulting dollar figure
becomes the deductible amount. As an example, 10 percent of an
adjusted gross income of $10,000 would be $1,000. Subtract that
from $3,900, and the actual deductible amount is $2,900. On the
other hand, if the adjustable gross income is $50,000, there can be
no deductible, because 10 percent ($5,000) is more than $3,900.
</P>
<P>
   Green said full information on this subject can be found on page
6 of IRS publication 547, Casualties, Disaster and Theft.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know the next Super Bowl will be in Tampa, but have the
dates and locations of others after that been announced?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The next two will be in New Orleans, on Jan. 27, 2002;
and in San Diego, on Jan. 26, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that the Oscar statues are dipped in a 24-karat gold
solution. How much does it cost to produce them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Each statuette costs about $350 to fabricate, said John
Pavlik, communications director at the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 are made each year, he added, to ensure that there are
enough in case of ties, honorary or special achievement awards, or
other unforeseen circumstances. No one knows the exact number of
statuettes that will be presented until the envelopes are opened
March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Other factoids: Each statuette is made from the alloy britannium
and then is plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally 24-karat
gold. The original statuettes were solid bronze, and for a while
they were made of plaster. They stand 13 1/2 inches tall and weigh
8 1/2 pounds. To date, 2,328 have been presented. The official
name, by the way, isn't Oscar; it's the Academy Award of Merit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just got back from Florida, where I received the new $1
coins in change at two stores, Wal-Mart and Sam's Club. I was told
they had exclusive distribution of the coins for a limited period.
If true, how could the government favor one retailer over another?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was a practical reason. The U.S. Mint introduced the
new Golden Dollar in stages, one of which was an arrangement with
Wal-Mart and Sam's Clubs to put the dollar coins into their cash
drawers. Mint spokesman Michael White traced the initiative back to
the lack of acceptance of the earlier Susan B. Anthony dollar coin.
In 20 years, that coin ``never made it into the retail arena,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So this time around, with the new Golden Dollar, the Mint talked
with several retailers about ways to get them into cash drawers _
and consumers' pockets _ quickly. Wal-Mart and Sam's Clubs were the
first to agree with the Mint to begin using the coins, White said.
The Mint thought people would be more likely to get them quickly at
these huge retail outlets than at a bank, he added.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, the Golden Dollars were distributed in some boxes of
Cheerios. On Jan. 18, the Federal Reserve began receiving a supply.
On Jan. 27, the Federal Reserve began sending them to financial
institutions, and the Mint began offering the coins in rolls and
bags on its Web site. Wal-Marts and Sam's Clubs began distributing
them Jan. 30, with the promotion limited to February.
</P>
<P>
   March 1 is the target date for 200 million of the new coins to
be in general circulation.
</P>

   EDs: This is File 1 of 2
</P>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call (404) 222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the large amount of money that Steve Forbes spent on his
presidential campaign tax deductible?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. IRS spokesman Mark Green explained that amounts incurred
by an individual seeking public office aren't deductible as
business expenses. The same goes for re-election campaign expenses
for an officeholder. Forbes was reported to have spent a total of
some $66 million on his campaigns in 1996 and this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Also not deductible, by the way, are expenses for the support
of, or opposition to, any candidate for public office. This means
that contributions, gifts, or any other amount paid for
``participation or intervention'' in any political campaign on
behalf of any candidate for public office cannot be claimed as a
deduction. This includes donations to a political party, committee,
group or candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A news magazine recently reported that Sally Hemings was a
half-sister of Thomas Jefferson's wife. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: It has been reported often that Hemings was the illegitimate
half-sister of Jefferson's deceased wife, Martha, the offspring of
a relationship between John Wayles and Elizabeth ``Betty'' Hemings,
a slave. Wayles was the father of Martha Wayles, who married
Jefferson. When Wayles died, Sally Hemings became Jefferson's
property when he inherited the Wayles estate in 1774.
</P>
<P>
   Details about Sally Hemings can be found at libraries. Among the
resources: ``Black Women in America/An Historical Encyclopedia''
and ``Notable Black American Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: An author in Britain named Irving sued an Emory professor and
her publisher for calling him a ``holocaust revisionist.'' The
trial was covered extensively for some days, then disappeared from
the news. What's the status of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The trial of historical writer David Irving's libel lawsuit
against Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt ended its fifth
week on Feb. 10. It is expected to continue until late March.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has been presenting a series of witnesses to
challenge Irving's merits as an historian, and to attack his
honesty as a writer. Under English libel law, attorneys
representing Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin Press, must prove
the truth of assertions contained in a book by Lipstadt that Irving
denied conventional accounts of the Holocaust and manipulated
historical facts to support his position.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt's book, ``Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on
Truth and Memory,'' was published in Britain in 1994. Irving says
the book misrepresented his position, damaged his reputation, and
generated waves of hatred against him. Lipstadt's lawyers accuse
him of being a liar and a falsifier of history.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In what years were the Susan B. Anthony coins produced for
general circulation?
</P>
<P>
   A: 1979-81, plus an uncirculated coin set in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After a commercial airplane crashes, and the flight number is
reported so often that it becomes etched in people's minds, are the
airlines required to retire that number?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the Federal Aviation Administration and the Air
Transport Association, there's no regulation requiring airlines to
retire numbers falling into that category, such as TWA 800. But
Diana Cronan of the Washington-based ATA said it's typical for an
airline to stop using a recognizable flight number ``after any
high-profile accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What ever became of Lenny Skutnik, the man who jumped into
the icy waters of the Potomac River in an attempt to save
passengers in the early-'80s crash of an Air Florida flight? He was
singled out by President Reagan in a State of the Union address,
but I haven't heard anything about him since.
</P>
<P>
   A: At last report, Skutnik was still working at the same job he
had at the Congressional Budget Office in Washington when the crash
occurred on Jan. 13,1982.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Skutnik was on his way to his home in Lorton, Va.
As he neared the crash site, he saw a woman, later identified as a
flight attendant, in the river. She appeared to be losing her grip
on a rescue line. He jumped into the frigid water and dragged her
to safety.
</P>
<P>
   His act of heroism didn't go unnoticed. His biggest moment in
the spotlight came less than two weeks later, during Reagan's first
State of the Union address, when Reagan was discussing heroes. ``We
don't have to turn to our history books for heroes. They're all
around us,'' he said, recounting Skutnik's lifesaving deed. Skutnik
was in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last year with the Washington Post, Skutnik said
the crash rescue incident, and the mention by Reagan, didn't change
his life. ``I got caught up in the moment, but I knew it would
eventually be over,'' he said. ``At first ... I had no control over
it. But then I got back to work, back to normal, and things didn't
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Delta Air Lines has restored an old DC-3 prop
plane that had been in its fleet years and years ago. Can the
public buy a ride on it?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. As Delta has explained previously, Ship 41, as it's
called, is being used only for major air shows and Delta-sponsored
events _ not for commercial or sightseeing flights.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Super Bowl Sunday next year is Jan. 28. When and how can fans
enter the lottery to try and get tickets?
</P>
<P>
   A: As you know, most Super Bowl tickets go to corporate sponsors
and other companies and individuals related to the business side of
the game. Another allotment is set aside for the competing teams. A
small percentage _ a National Football League spokesman wouldn't
specify exactly how many _ goes to the public through a random
drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 Super Bowl will be played in Tampa. Anyone wanting to
get into the pool of potential applicants should send a certified
postcard with name, address and telephone number to: NFL Lottery,
280 Park Ave., New York, NY 10017. The deadline is June 1. Those
whose cards are chosen will be notified ``around the first of
November,'' the NFL spokesman said. Price information will be
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an Internet site where I can look up Sen. John
McCain's voting record?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Web site of the non-partisan organization Project Vote
Smart _ www.vote-smart.org _ is a good place to start for voting
record information on any U.S. senator or House member.
</P>
<P>
   It displays a map of the United States. When you click on the
state you're interested in (Arizona, obviously, for McCain), you'll
find a wealth of data. Votes over a varying period on many issues _
such as affirmative action, gun issues, foreign aid, senior issues,
welfare and many more _ can be accessed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV commentator referred to the medal just awarded to Alfred
Rascon as the Congressional Medal of Honor. I thought it was just
the Medal of Honor. Who is right?
</P>
<P>
   A: You are. The proper name of the highest military decoration
that the United States grants to members of its armed forces is
simply the Medal of Honor. But the word ``Congressional''
frequently is added because the medal is presented by a high
official ``in the name of the Congress of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Rascon shielded men from grenade blasts in Vietnam 34 years ago,
but because of apparent administrative snafus, only now has he been
honored with the medal. It was approved by Defense Secretary
William Cohen in November and awarded to Rascon on Tuesday at the
White House by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose? Some time
ago I read that it was bought and moved by barge from California to
Oregon. Is it on display now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not yet. The Hughes Flying Boat HK-1 is still in pieces, but
is expected to be reassembled in stages and put on display, along
with 40-50 other vintage aircraft, in early 2001. The Spruce Goose
will be the centerpiece of a museum under construction at the Capt.
Michael King Smith Evergreen Educational Institute in McMinnville,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Thompson, spokesman for the facility, said workers hope to
start putting the Spruce Goose in place in August or September. The
fuselage first will be placed in a 7-foot pit, after which the
wings, and then the tail, will be attached. Other aircraft will be
placed around the gigantic HK-1, while others will be suspended
from the museum's superstructure.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the museum can be found online at
http://sprucegoose.org.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in obtaining a copy of President Clinton's
2001 budget. How do I get one?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2001,
and related Office of Management and Budget documents can be
purchased at any Government Printing Office bookstore. One is in
Atlanta (999 Peachtree St. NE, Suite 120; telephone 404-347-1900).
The documents are priced separately: $38 for the budget; $72 for
the appendix; $54 for analytical perspectives; $28 for historical
tables; $3.75 for A Citizen's Guide to the Federal Budget, Fiscal
Year 2001; $3.25 for The Budget System and Concepts, Fiscal Year
2001; and $17 for the budget on CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to buy it, you may be able to view the
material at a public library, said Linda Schimmel of Congressional
Budget Office Publications. Budget documents also can be downloaded
from the Internet at www.gpo.gov/usbudget.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Don McLean's song ``American Pie'' has been in the news
recently because of a remake by Madonna. Beyond the generally
understood explanation that the lyrics are about the early days of
rock and roll, what do the words mean? For example, who are ``the
father, son and the holy ghost''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Numerous interpretations have been offered about the 1971
song's lyrics. Many Web sites exist that attempt to explain it. One
_ www.americanpie2000.com/americanpie/ _ lists this as its
interpretation of the line in Verse 6:
</P>
<P>
   ``And the three men I admire most The Father Son and Holy
Ghost'' refers to Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper (J.P. Richardson) and
Richie Valens.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Web site explains, McLean has never provided an
explanation of the meaning of ``American Pie,'' which has added to
the song's mystery.
</P>
<P>
   This interpretation suggests that the entire song is a tribute
to Holly and a commentary on how rock and roll music changed in the
years since his death in 1959. In that view, McLean is lamenting
the lack of ``danceable'' good-time party music in rock and roll
and, in part, is attributing that lack to the absence of Buddy
Holly, et. al.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative explanation, on a different Web site, says McLean
was a Catholic, and Verse 6 deals with religion and godless acts.
So if you accept that, the words refer to the traditional Trinity
of Christian theology.
</P>
<P>
   A search engine such as Yahoo can link you to several resources
for ``American Pie.'' That way, you can take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to visit cemeteries where famous people, such as
Buddy Holly and Richie Valens, are buried. Is there a book with
that sort of information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several books with such information should be readily
available at libraries or bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books in Print (1999-2000)'' lists these titles, for example:
``Who Lies Where: A Guide to Famous Graves'' by Michael Kerrigan
(Trafalgar Square Publishing Co.); ``Discovering Famous Graves'' by
Lynn F. Pearson (Shire Publications); ``Final Curtain _ Deaths of
Noted Movie and TV Personalities'' by Everett Grant Jarvis (Carol
Publishing Group); and ``Final Curtain: Eternal Resting Places of
Stars, Celebrities, Moguls, Misers, Misfits &AMP; Their Stories'' by
Margaret Burk and Gary Hudson (Seven Locks Press).
</P>
<P>
   Some information is very specific. For example, ``Final Curtain
_ Deaths of Noted Movie and TV Personalities'' shows that Valens is
buried at Missions Hills Cemetery in Mission Hills, Calif., Section
C, at Curb No. 247, three rows in. It doesn't list Holly's burial
place, but the Buddy Holly Center in Lubbock, Texas, confirmed that
he's buried in the City of Lubbock Cemetery. Holly was born in
Lubbock.

   Q: When airline flights are long and nonstop, such as 16 hours
between Atlanta and South Africa, how does it work with the cockpit
crew? Are there regulations about how long they can be at the
controls?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. International carriers are bound by the regulations of
their respective countries, according to the Montreal-based
International Civil Aviation Organization.

   In the case of the new South African Airways flights to and from
Atlanta, two sets of captains operate the aircraft on shifts, said

the aircraft for several hours, then rests in facilities that are
required to be available while someone else is at the controls.
After resting, the first person returns to duty. The eight hours is
``actual flying time,'' by the way, and doesn't include preflight
preparations, Bergen said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it still possible to purchase official programs from the
Atlanta Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, as long as supplies last. The Atlanta Super Bowl Host
Committee suggests checking an online source,
www.officialstuff.com, which as of Feb. 9 indicated programs were
available for $19.95 (shipping and handling included). A spokesman
at National Football League headquarters in New York said programs
also can be ordered by calling 1-877-NFL-SHOP (1-877-635-7467).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported how to convert temperatures from
Celsius to Fahrenheit. Is there a similar formula for determining
wind chill?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but it's complex. A simpler way is to check a chart that
has temperatures in Fahrenheit ranging from, say, 45 degrees above
zero to 45 below, relating them to wind velocity.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the formula is complicated is that the wind chill
equivalents don't simply double if, for instance, the actual
temperature is steady but the wind speed doubles. Say the air
temperature is 25 degrees F and the wind velocity is 10 mph; the
numerical table puts the wind chill equivalent temperature at 10.
If the temperature is the same (25) and the wind velocity is
doubled to 20 mph, the wind chill equivalent is 3 below zero. If
the temperature is 25 and the wind velocity is 30 mph, the wind
chill equivalent is 10 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
   A chart can be found in World Book Encyclopedia, available at
any library. Look under ``Wind chill.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: On a recent episode of the TV game show ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' the name of the Michelin mascot was identified as
Bibendum. We thought it was simply ``the Michelin tire man.'' What
is the origin of the name Bibendum, and how was it chosen as the
mascot?
</P>
<P>
   A: The genesis of the name Bibendum came in February 1893, at
the conference of the Society of Civil Engineers of Paris, when
Andre Michelin introduced the expression that was to become a
Michelin motto: ``The tire drinks obstacles.'' A year later, at the
Exposition Universelle et Coloniale at Lyon, France, Andre and his
brother, Edouard, noticed a pile of tires of varying sizes. Edouard
remarked to Andre that if the pile of tires had arms, it would look
like a man. Thus was the idea planted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1897, illustrator Marius Rossillon, who went by the pseudonym
O'Galop, showed the Michelin brothers several ideas for publicity.
One was a sketch showing a drinker raising his arm, with the motto,
``Nunc est bibendum'' (``It's time to drink''), after a verse from
Horace. The line reminded Andre of the phrase ``The tire drinks
obstacles.'' So he ordered a poster from O'Galop, who created one
the following year using a character composed of tires and
repeating the ``Nunc est bibendum'' motto.
</P>
<P>
   The association was complete when, several months later, a race
car driver spotted Andre Michelin and shouted, ``There's
Bibendum.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently on the selection process for candidates
for the TV program ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Can you give
me similar information about getting on ``Wheel of Fortune''?
</P>
<P>
   A: A new system called the ``Wheelmobile,'' which will visit
several cities each month, is in the works. There's no schedule yet
for when and where it will be going, said a show spokeswoman. Her
advice: Watch local affiliates on which the program is broadcast,
and they will announce locations and schedules for the Wheelmobile.
</P>
<P>
   Once locations are established, people who want to be an
audience member or a contestant can go there and enter their names
and telephone numbers into a database. Names then will be chosen
randomly.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to make the system more equitable for people
nationwide, rather than having contestants and audience members
basically coming from the show's home base in Southern California,
the spokeswoman said. She added that nothing will happen soon,
because the show is scheduled to go on hiatus for a couple of
months.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the recent spell of cold and ice in Georgia damaged the
Vidalia onion crop?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lovers of the sweet onions will be happy to hear that the
worst of the harsh weather bypassed the exclusive growing area. A
spokeswoman at Morris Farms in east-central Georgia said a few
onions may have suffered, but the majority of the crop is expected
to be fine. She said the onions should be in grocery stores in late
April, and will be available through June, or even longer if kept
in cold storage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports indicate that oil found on a Russian freighter
originated from Iraq. How was that conclusion reached?
</P>
<P>
   A: The vessel carried a load of gas oil, a refined product often
used as diesel fuel. Samples were flown to the U.S. Customs Service
Laboratory in San Francisco, the routine procedure in cases of
suspected smuggling in the Persian Gulf. The sample's chemical
signature then was compared to those in a library of 3,000
reference samples collected worldwide. A positive match showed that
the tanker's cargo had originated as crude oil from an Iraqi well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We lost two pine and five maple trees as a result of ice
storms. They broke in two, so must be removed. Since none caused
damage to my home, my insurance company won't reimburse me. I have
a bid for $4,000 from a tree-removal company to remove the wood. Is
that deductible as a casualty loss on my income tax return?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some of it may be deductible, but several factors must be
taken into account, said IRS spokesman Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's a ``$100 rule,'' that must be applied, meaning
you reduce the figure to $3,900. Then you must apply another rule,
which requires calculating 10 percent of your adjusted gross
income. If that is less than $3,900, the resulting dollar figure
becomes the deductible amount. As an example, 10 percent of an
adjusted gross income of $10,000 would be $1,000. Subtract that
from $3,900, and the actual deductible amount is $2,900. On the
other hand, if the adjustable gross income is $50,000, there can be
no deductible, because 10 percent ($5,000) is more than $3,900.
</P>
<P>
   Green said full information on this subject can be found on page
6 of IRS publication 547, Casualties, Disaster and Theft.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know the next Super Bowl will be in Tampa, but have the
dates and locations of others after that been announced?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The next two will be in New Orleans, on Jan. 27, 2002;
and in San Diego, on Jan. 26, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that the Oscar statues are dipped in a 24-karat gold
solution. How much does it cost to produce them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Each statuette costs about $350 to fabricate, said John
Pavlik, communications director at the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 are made each year, he added, to ensure that there are
enough in case of ties, honorary or special achievement awards, or
other unforeseen circumstances. No one knows the exact number of
statuettes that will be presented until the envelopes are opened
March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Other factoids: Each statuette is made from the alloy britannium
and then is plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally 24-karat
gold. The original statuettes were solid bronze, and for a while
they were made of plaster. They stand 13 1/2 inches tall and weigh
8 1/2 pounds. To date, 2,328 have been presented. The official
name, by the way, isn't Oscar; it's the Academy Award of Merit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just got back from Florida, where I received the new $1
coins in change at two stores, Wal-Mart and Sam's Club. I was told
they had exclusive distribution of the coins for a limited period.
If true, how could the government favor one retailer over another?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was a practical reason. The U.S. Mint introduced the
new Golden Dollar in stages, one of which was an arrangement with
Wal-Mart and Sam's Clubs to put the dollar coins into their cash
drawers. Mint spokesman Michael White traced the initiative back to
the lack of acceptance of the earlier Susan B. Anthony dollar coin.
In 20 years, that coin ``never made it into the retail arena,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So this time around, with the new Golden Dollar, the Mint talked
with several retailers about ways to get them into cash drawers _
and consumers' pockets _ quickly. Wal-Mart and Sam's Clubs were the
first to agree with the Mint to begin using the coins, White said.
The Mint thought people would be more likely to get them quickly at
these huge retail outlets than at a bank, he added.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, the Golden Dollars were distributed in some boxes of
Cheerios. On Jan. 18, the Federal Reserve began receiving a supply.
On Jan. 27, the Federal Reserve began sending them to financial
institutions, and the Mint began offering the coins in rolls and
bags on its Web site. Wal-Marts and Sam's Clubs began distributing
them Jan. 30, with the promotion limited to February.
</P>
<P>
   March 1 is the target date for 200 million of the new coins to
be in general circulation.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Oil cartels again pillage little guy's wallet
 &HT;    (For release Feb. 20, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The motorist tooling around in a 5,000-pound Lincoln Navigator
probably will not be fazed much by the breakneck increase in fuel
prices. After all, if you can afford a $46,000 vehicle, what's
another couple of bucks for gas?
</P>
<P>
   The American economy is good, the experts say; everyone
supposedly is rolling in money. Yeah? How about the little guy who
drives 20 miles to a factory job and back every day? How about what
he's having to pay for gasoline these days _ as opposed to his
income and current financial obligations?
</P>
<P>
   There are several types of motoring public in this country.
There are those in the gas-guzzling Navigators, Expeditions and
Broncos who can afford it. There are those who heeded the warnings
of President Carter a quarter-century ago and purchased more
fuel-efficient autos (example: Navigator, 12 mpg; Honda Civic, 25
mpg.) And there are those in the lower economic strata, driving 6-
or 10-year-old cars that drain gasoline quicker than you can say
OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   While the president is well-intending when he seeks to release
some of the U.S. emergency fuel supply, and to financially assist
people in parts of the country where the price of heating oil has
ascended beyond all reason, he is not addressing the issue.
</P>
<P>
   That issue is U.S. dependence on foreign oil. It is the same
issue Richard Nixon faced with the 1973 Arab oil embargo and it is
the same issue each succeeding president has encountered without
success.
</P>
<P>
   It may well be that fortunes are being made on E-trading and in
technology stocks, but people with fortunes _ or close to it _
really wouldn't be expected to pout much over a rise of about 30
cents a gallon in a short period. For the salaried, for those on
fixed income, this is very much a huge increase in the cost of
living.
</P>
<P>
   How we allowed ourselves to fall victim again to the oil cartels
is beyond me. Too much of what I hear from the men who would be
president is about abortion. Nothing they say or don't say is going
to change anyone else's mind on abortion; they ought to move on to
a new subject: What are we going to do about oil prices? Who did
this to us? And why? Can't we force their hands back to normality?
</P>
<P>
   An international boat show is taking place in Miami this
weekend. The front page of the local newspaper showed a full-color
aerial photo of a waterway crammed with luxury boats. The story
talked about a 60-foot sport fisherman costing $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, elsewhere in largely immigrant Miami, motorists are
seeking gas stations that might be charging a penny less than the
one down the street, the total difference in a 15-gallon tank being
less than a half-buck.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines, rather than cutting back on the peanuts and tuna salad
sandwiches, have added fuel surcharges to their ticket prices.
Mobile street peddlers are charging more for tomatoes today because
they are paying more for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   This is the stuff of which inflation is made. I don't need Alan
Greenspan to tell me that.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has to get a handle on energy, particularly
renewable energy. It has been too long since we were told that this
country needed to be less dependent upon foreign interests for our
energy, and to be more fuel efficient in our transportation modes.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has happened. In fact, we've drifted from a trend toward
fuel-efficient vehicles to one of gas-guzzling SUVs and minivans.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we're paying the price. Tomorrow, we'll be paying more.

 &HT;    Howls at the dog tracks
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHORTER, Ala. _ Virginia Fannin sells her share of Lance peanut
bars, fan belts, cigars and Cokes from the small, rural grocery
that bears her family's name.
</P>
<P>
   Like many in Macon County, however, Fannin knows that the
business that really puts food on the table sits down the road. In
other counties, breadwinners work at car factories. In Huntsville,
they make rockets. Here, they build dreams for $2 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   VictoryLand Greyhound Park rises from the dirt and asphalt less
than five minutes from the Fannin Grocery on a two-lane country
highway next to Interstate 85. In 1986, VictoryLand was the top
track in the nation, handling $188 million in wagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there. No use in lying about it,'' said Fannin,
echoing a truism of life for many in this county 15 miles east of
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   For years, though, VictoryLand has been off track financially.
Casinos in Mississippi have drained business for a decade.
Lotteries in Georgia and Florida have siphoned off patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Video gambling is the stopper, track officials claim. They want
to add poker, blackjack and similar games to keep the tour buses
from rolling to the Gulf Coast. Dog tracks in Rhode Island, Iowa
and West Virginia added video gambling machines after they faced
similar competition.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents claim the instant games are so addictive that they
call them the ``crack cocaine'' of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, former Gov. David Beasley called the games a
``cancer'' on society and vowed to eliminate them, then lost
re-election in 1998 after video poker supporters donated millions
to his opponent. Ironically, legislators have voted to ban the
games starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama Tourism and Marketing Committee will conducted a
public hearing Wednesday in Montgomery on a bill that would allow
Macon County residents to vote on whether they want video gambling
at their dog track.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a version of the bill passed a Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation would let residents in Mobile, Birmingham
and Greene County decide whether to allow video gambling at dog
tracks there.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Johnny Ford introduced the bill as local legislation for
Macon County. Traditionally, laws proposed for specific communities
have passed without debate from lawmakers in unaffected parts of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   But gambling opponents _ whose pressure led to the overwhelming
defeat of a statewide referendum last year that would have created
an Alabama lottery _ might not let the video gaming bills pass
without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by The Associated Press showed 49 percent in the
House and 45 percent of the Senate opposed the video gambling
bills. After the lottery's autumn defeat, pro-lottery lawmakers
want to rack up some anti-gambling votes before the 2002 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, who fought the lottery, says tracks are
exaggerating their financial plights. ``Any senator who votes for
gambling after the people rejected gambling last October is going
to do so at his or her risk,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   For VictoryLand, the issue is survival, said Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The track is the largest private employer in the county. It has
cut back to about 400 workers after hitting a high of 800 in the
late 1980s, including 500 full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, this is our Mercedes. This is our Honda,'' said Ford,
referring to automakers Alabama lured to other counties.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when you couldn't get a weekend room at the
Days Inn next to VictoryLand without a reservation. Up to 30
charter buses, many from Atlanta, would jam the parking lot. Even
during the week, matinee races would pack 'em in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you had the machines there, you wouldn't have to go to
Mississippi, would you?'' Fannin said from behind her grocery
counter. ``I'd vote for it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million people wagered $176 million in 1990 at
VictoryLand. Last year, just 305,000 customers bet $85 million,
according to industry spokesman Rick Heartstill.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the industry's slump nationwide, VictoryLand and
the Birmingham Race Course _ both owned by a Montgomery businessman
_ still ranked among the country's top 10 in wagering in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The track provides a big wad of cash for Macon County. Just
23,000 people live there. Per capita income is $14,300 _ among the
lowest in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   When the state Senate rejected a similar video gambling bill
last year, employees in the VictoryLand break room shook their
heads in resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no real industry here,'' said Charles Johnson, head of
the Macon County Racing Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Since the track opened in 1984, its revenue has helped generate
$37 million for the county school board, $6 million for the county
commission and $7 million for the city of Tuskegee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would hurt if they closed,'' said Vijay Patel, who runs the
Days Inn outside the track's gate. ``They pay a lot of taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent midweek matinee, a bus from East Point, Ga.,
pulled into the parking lot. Inside, the infield scoreboard
encouraged bettors: ``Avoid the last minute rush. Please wager
early.'' Down on the track, dog grooms dressed in navy blue
jumpsuits walk the greyhounds to eight metal starting boxes. They
slide shut metal doors behind the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   There's a slight pause. Then: Bing, bing, bing, bing.
</P>
<P>
   Like the gentle tone on an airplane alerting you the ``fasten
seatbelt'' light has been turned off, a bing tells you the
motorized lure the dogs will chase has started whipping around the
track. Race time is almost here. It will be over in less than 32
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pari-mutuel racing is suffering basically due to the new
competition because it's so quick. There's instant gratification,''
said Roy Berger, president of the American Greyhound Track Owners
Association, a group that represents all 49 of the nation's dog
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horses run about every 30 minutes,'' Berger said. ``One of the
reasons that dog tracks became so popular in the '70s and '80s was
because we could run two or three races in 30 minutes. Now, people
can pull the handle on a slot machine every 20 or 25 seconds.''

 &HT;    C'mon Regis, I want to be a millionaire
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I have an addiction. Actually, I have
several, but let's not go there. I have become obsessed with ``Who
Wants to be a Millionaire.'' I rarely miss an episode. One of my
proudest moments came when the million-dollar question popped up a
few weeks back, and I knew the answer before the four choices were
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far is the Earth from the sun?'' asked Regis Philbin, the
man with the solid-silk ties and gangster suits, finally free from
Kathy Lee Gifford, at least in prime time. He's bound to be doing
the happy dance every night.
</P>
<P>
   Easy, it's 93 million miles, I thought, while running a piece of
oak through the jointer-planer in my shop. Bingo. The actual
contestant and I got it right. I have no idea why I remembered that
piece of trivia, but I did. Thus the germ of an idea began to form.
</P>
<P>
   Playing at home, I am the king, impressing wife and children
with my alleged acumen. Being in the newspaper business gives you
is a treasure trove of useless information. ``You should try to get
on the show,'' the people with whom I live implore.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I say. I am a firm believer in the American way, which is
trying to beat long odds to become rich overnight. I still buy
lotto tickets, even though I know I have a better chance of being
killed by a falling buzzard. My brother says the lottery is
gambling for the mathematically challenged. So? I am mathematically
challenged. That's why I'm in journalism and not engineering. And,
by gosh, somebody has to win eventually. For $2 a week, I can dream
of being the next instant millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   I know enough about probability theory to never bet more than a
buck, at most two, on a 1-in-16 million chance of winning big
money. There is not a lot of difference between having those odds
or increasing them to 20-in-16-million by betting $20. But I can
lose a buck twice a week and not worry about it. Twenty bucks
starts cutting into the fluff money, the spare change spent on soft
drinks, video rentals and other non-essentials.
</P>
<P>
   So I made an effort to get on the show. The first night, I
dialed in for two hours, hitting the redial button while reading.
Busy, busy, busy. I never got through. The next night, I started
earlier and got connected after about five tries. Here we go, I
thought. I'm on the road to winning a million bucks before taxes,
which won't be enough to retire but ought to keep the wolves from
the door as I send a herd of children through college.
</P>
<P>
   It's all done by voice-mail. No live humans are involved at the
entry level. I entered my birth date and the last four digits of my
Social Security number. The object is to answer three questions,
which gets you to the next level. If you've watched the show, the
format is like the ``fast finger'' challenge by which Regis picks a
new contestant for the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   My question: Put the following words that form the title of a
famous children's book in the correct order, in 10 seconds: Mother.
Are. My. You.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. ``You Are My Mother.'' I punched the keypad on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   I was wrong. It's ``Are You My Mother?'' Y'all probably knew
that. I didn't. The rules banned me from playing until the next
day. Depression and embarrassment kept me away for about three
days. Then I tried again, getting through on the first try. It must
be a sign, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put the following words in the correct order: Bay, Bengal,
The, Of.'' Tough, huh?
</P>
<P>
   I got it wrong again, when I hit the wrong key on the phone pad.
I am notoriously bad at phone pads, which is one reason I despise
phone numbers that use letters, such as 1-800-The-Body. I am
keypad-challenged. Regis hung up on me again. I'm thinking that a
round of therapy may be in my immediate future, and then made the
mistake of telling my wife of my miscues. She laughed and made
large fun of me. I deserve this. Too much strutting in the living
room while popping off answers under absolutely no pressure. Call
it karma.
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened the third time. Once again, I knew the answer,
and once again messed up on the keypad. Regis said goodbye. I'm
hoping the computer doesn't keep a record of the mistakes, or I'll
never get on the show. Too dumb to live, the computer would say,
let alone be on ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not giving up hope. I will call back, once I've gotten over
the pain of earlier rejection. Easy money has a powerful allure.

 &HT;    Political rules reassert themselves
 &HT;    By Martin Gottlieb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For a while there, this political season was
upsetting the best _ and one of most unknown _ rules of
presidential politics. To wit, presidential nomination fights are
about credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about money, standing in the polls, personality, campaign
ability, the quality of a campaign organization, issues and
ideology. Ask only who is the closest thing to a president, the
most acknowledged national leader. If one person stands out, that
person will get the nomination. If not, there will be a scramble.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, presidents always get presidential nominations they
pursue. So do vice presidents: Richard Nixon, 1960; Hubert
Humphrey, 1968; George Bush, 1988. Even former vice presidents
always get nominations they pursue _ Richard Nixon, 1968; Walter
Mondale, 1984 _ unless extraordinary circumstances prevail.
Humphrey lost in 1972, but only because he didn't enter the race
until his chosen candidate, Edmund Muskie, self-destructed. And Dan
Quayle was so lacking in support in 1996 that he decided to not
even make the race; he tried in 2000, but only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   So Al Gore couldn't fail in 2000 without falling into the same
category as Quayle, where he really didn't seem to fit. And yet for
a while there it looked dicey. Bill Bradley took a good lead in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to hit a wall. The best bet is that the reason is
not that Gore finally got his act together, but that a sitting vice
president simply has a large, locked-in corps of
benefit-of-the-doubt support from the public on the basis of his
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a vice president or former vice president in
the field, a guy like the Bob Dole of 1996 has a great advantage.
He had been a leader of his party for many years in Washington, a
genuine national figure. He had once been the GOP nominee for vice
president and had been talked about for the presidency for years.
Some of his opponents had hardly been thought of as presidential
timber by anybody but themselves (Steve Forbes, Pat Buchanan, Lamar
Alexander).
</P>
<P>
   Dole pretty much breezed to the nomination, much like Ronald
Reagan in 1980, another year when there was no vice president in
the field. Reagan was the two-term governor of the largest state,
acknowledged leader of the then-soaring conservative movement, a
man who had almost been nominated for president in 1976. It was
simply his turn.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there's simply nobody like that in the race. In such
cases _ the Democrats in 1976, 1988 and 1992 _ there is a scramble.
The Republicans faced such a year in 2000 and decided they didn't
want a scramble.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP politicians and financial contributors decided that if
nobody in the field had national standing _ if nobody had the
respect of the American people that results from being nationally
visible for a long time without making a jerk of oneself _ they
would pick the guy who looked strongest in the polls and pretend he
did.
</P>
<P>
   In metaphorical smoke-filled rooms _ supposedly marginalized in
presidential politics with the modern advent of primaries _ they
invented George W. Bush as a national figure.
</P>
<P>
   But they couldn't quite make their support substitute for his
lack of pre-existing national standing. He isn't coasting, money or
no money, endorsements or no endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   If the John McCain phenomenon were happening in the Democratic
Party, it would be running up against the vice presidency and
having a lot more trouble. In the Republican Party, it is running
up against nothing in particular in the realm of presidential
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's credentials in the realm of national leadership aren't
exceptional, either. So there's a fight. But at least it's not in a
smoke-filled room.

 &HT;    Bush has gone from free agent to religious-right mouthpiece
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Phil Gramm, I was missing you so.
</P>
<P>
   For a Texas pundit, Gramm is like a mountain spring, always
there when the canteen rattles.
</P>
<P>
   When most of us were at a word loss for what happened on the way
to George W. Bush's inauguration, Gramm gurgled this:
</P>
<P>
   ``No Texan has ever done well in New Hampshire. Those people
expect candidates to grovel. Texans have many skills. Groveling
isn't one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Grovel'' is a good Gramm word. Very guttural.
</P>
<P>
   And what a man to bring up the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Texans too proud to grovel? In 1996 Gramm prostrated himself
before the religious right in a quest for the GOP presidential
nomination. His gain? After a staggering defeat in Louisiana, Gramm
was out of the race before he was off his knees.
</P>
<P>
   And now, who's hugging the floor in deference to the Christian
Coalition but George Bush?
</P>
<P>
   No one was in a better position, as a well-endowed,
well-endorsed candidate, to tell Coalition founder Pat Robertson to
go to hell, figuratively speaking.
</P>
<P>
   The last person you'd expect Bush to cozy up to would be the
airwaves kingmaker who sees a king in the mirror. Bush has openly
warred with the Christian Coalition for control of the Texas
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas isn't South Carolina after a stunning primary loss.
What disbelieving eyes are seeing, as the anointed GOP front-runner
struggles to right his vessel, is Bush in Robertson's servitude.
</P>
<P>
   Here we had Bush defending the character of the organization
against the criticisms of John McCain. McCain has ample reason to
criticize. Robertson effectively has called McCain a stalking horse
for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   This is fascinating because on the key social issues for the
religious right, particularly on abortion, they show scant
difference. One difference: McCain hasn't groveled.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference: McCain appears to be consistent, while Bush
is posing for voters in fuzz focus.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's debate, McCain pointed out that he and Bush both
support exceptions to a ban on abortion including cases of rape,
incest and the threat to a mother's life. Yet, McCain pointed out,
Bush supports the GOP platform, which would require a woman
impregnated by a rapist to bear the rapist's child.
</P>
<P>
   Either his rival hasn't read the platform, as McCain implied, or
Bush is just trying to play off as many sides as he can while
hoping that no one pays too close attention.
</P>
<P>
   As the religious right insists, the abortion issue has turned a
lot of GOP candidates once torn about abortion into springtime
zealots.
</P>
<P>
   No better example exists than Gramm. I remember asking him to
express a position _ any position _ on abortion a few years ago,
without success. Then Gramm ran for president and became, with the
Christian Coalition holding his coat, the most fervent
anti-abortion crusader imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is clear. Agents of zeal are crucial to winning
primaries and caucuses, be they Christian evangelicals or labor
unions. They are so crucial, apparently, that someone who won
distinction as a centrist and a consensus-seeker, like Bush, feels
he must abandon the middle and embrace extremists when the going
gets tough.
</P>
<P>
   What does the middle say about abortion? In the 1996 primaries,
exit poll after exit poll found a Republican majority opposing a
constitutional ban on abortion. This even as GOP candidates, with
an eye to the religious right, called for exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Democrats of the 1980s were the party in the throes
of ideological extremes when it came to electing presidents, so
today are the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can still win in South Carolina. The abdication of the hunt
by Steve Forbes may be his saving grace.
</P>
<P>
   Should Bush win the nomination, however, he has some groveling
to do to get back to the center.

 &HT;    Happy birthday: Many restaurants singing different tune
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you've ever eaten out, you know the drill: Right in
the middle of your surf-and-turf, some hapless diner is surrounded
by waiters belting out a happy birthday song.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the ``Happy Birthday'' song. Many restaurants have
replaced the century-old original with their own versions, which
have waiters singing a different tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea where it came from, but it's official
company policy for us to sing our own birthday song,'' said Janice
Dehnkamp, manager of an Atlanta-area Folks restaurant. ``I think
it's more fun. We sing it off-key on purpose, and then give away a
dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning the company's birthday song is also part of the
training ritual for employees of the Texas-based Metromedia
Restaurant Group, parent company for Bennigan's, Bonanza, Steak and
Ale and Ponderosa.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Chris Barnes said the song was created by employees in
the late '70s, and goes a little something like this: ``Happy,
happy birthday, on this your special day! Happy, happy birthday is
what we're here to say!''
</P>
<P>
   Though it can't be verified, Barnes claims the Bennigan's
version launched a smorgasbord of half-baked imitators at other
restaurant chains. ``I wouldn't say the other restaurants ripped us
off, but we invented it,'' Barnes asserted.
</P>
<P>
   At Macaroni Grill restaurants, classically trained servers
serenade customers with an operatic version called ``Buon
Compleanno'' _ in Italian. The Longhorn Steakhouse version is less
high-falutin'. In keeping with its countrified ambience, Longhorn's
birthday song ends with the poetic lyrics ``hot damn!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our customers wrote it on a napkin, and it just caught
on,'' said Longhorn spokeswoman Pam Davis. ``It fits our concept
and is user-friendly for servers who are too embarrassed to sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally conceptual is Red Lobster's birthday anthem, which ends
with a cheery invitation to: ``Come back soon and eat more fish.''
</P>
<P>
   The story behind the traditional birthday song, penned by
Mildred Hill and her sister Patty Smith Hill in 1893, is a
well-documented piece of American folklore.
</P>
<P>
   The song's longevity is a no-brainer: Everybody has a birthday.
Figuring out why so many pretenders to the throne have surfaced is
a little trickier.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurateurs say the songs are simply an effective
marketing gimmick that leaves customers with a catchy jingle
ringing in their ears long after they've dined on their
complimentary cupcakes. There's another possible reason, however,
and it involves copyright lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its age, the Hill sisters' original song is still under
copyright, which means if it is performed in a public place _ like
a restaurant _ the owner must pay royalties.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is taken seriously by the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers. The New York licensing agency
collects fees on behalf of Warner/Chappell Music, a Los Angeles
company that holds the song's copyright.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't sue based on one song. But we could,'' said
Vincent Candeloria, licensing director for ASCAP in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Howard, senior lobbyist for the National Restaurant
Association, said most restaurateurs understand they might be on
the hook if ASCAP took them to court for improper use of a song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restaurants that don't want to violate the law have avoided
the whole issue by just coming up with their own songs,'' Howard
said. ``It makes sense.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: HOW LONELY IS IT OUT THERE IN CYBERSPACE?
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Feb. 20. By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A half-century-ago, David Riesman, a Yale
sociologist, found in ``The Lonely Crowd'' that Americans had
shifted from lives guided by internal gyroscopes to ones steered by
the currents of peer pressure and the mass media.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Norman Nie, a Stanford political scientist,
released a study that found the Internet fostered social isolation
among Americans, auguring an online society drained of genuine
human relationships and meaningful emotions. Some reports viewed
his findings as a cyber-age update of ``The Lonely Crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Nie sees the Internet as but the latest in a series of
technological upheavals that have served to disconnect people,
allowing them to drift away into the amorphous world of cyberspace.
Such views are at odds with champions of change, who see
information technology as a tool that begets wider democracy,
greater freedoms, improved societal links and better financial
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The recent spate of hacker attacks against the Web proved
traumatic to Internet insiders because they fear people may turn
away from what they perceive to be a blighted medium at the very
point when it appears poised to make a great leaps forward.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Renaissance society never disavowed books, even when
they found them packed with lies and chewed by rats. In our own
times, nearly everybody has a phone, even if it spawns unwanted
calls, and a TV set, even if the fare is often bland.
</P>
<P>
   A more nuanced view of the Web is voiced by Jakob Nielsen, a
transplanted Silicon Valley guru. The mild-mannered Dane came by to
tout his newly published 420-page book, ``Designing Web Usability:
The Practice of Simplicity'' (New Riders), as a tool for making
``the world safe for humans again.''
</P>
<P>
   As a newspaper man who started out in this business not long
after ``The Lonely Crowd'' came out, it wasn't pleasant to hear
Nielsen assert that our ``legacy media'' are doomed when new
hardware arrives, within the decade, that supports full media
integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why,'' Nielsen asks, ``do you have to choose among (1) seeing
moving images of an event on TV, (2) reading the full story in the
newspaper, or (3) reading a reflective analysis of the underlying
issues in a magazine?''
</P>
<P>
   But Nielsen sees a ``glorious future'' for most folks working in
current formats. ``I believe,'' he writes, ``that this may easily
happen because interactive media are more engaging than passive
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Nie study finds online activity to be essentially
anti-social and, therefore, alienating in nature. By contrast,
Nielsen predicts that an easier-to use Web will usher in a golden
age of communication through its unprecedented many-to-many
approach. ``The current Web,'' he concludes, ``just scratches the
surface relative to what's possible once everybody in the rich
world is connected through a single network.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it's safe to predict that, on the Web of the
future, both ``The Lonely Crowd'' and the worried Nie update will
be available for most anyone to download or to read on line.

 &HT;    Crystal River: A home where the manatee roam
 &HT;    By Louis Hillary Park
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRYSTAL RIVER, Fla. _ With its colonial pillars guarding the
main entrance, the Plantation Inn fights to maintain a certain Old
South dignity, even as ugly strip malls proliferate along nearby
U.S. 19. For the most part, the folks at the inn are succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the lawns and golf villas looked a bit worn and
faded, the public spaces inside the inn are elegant. There are
leather and plush fabrics and two cozy bars _ the sports-oriented
Den and the Library, a more formal watering hole between the
hotel's restaurant and lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby staircase is of the sort that Scarlett O'Hara might
have favored. But fiddle-dee-dee, that's not all. More than a
million dollars' worth of renovations have added freshness to the
large, comfortable rooms. In my room, an armoire (housing a TV) and
multipaned windows gave the feeling of being in a friend's guest
room rather than an inn with 126 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Located on the Crystal River, the Plantation Inn is not so much
rooms, as it is a base for exploring outdoor activities on what's
called the ``Nature Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Take a guided fishing tour along the Crystal River or head out
into the Gulf of Mexico for saltwater fishing. You can pack your
own picnic or let your guide prepare lunch for you on one of the
secluded islands.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer swimming with fish to catching them, there's a
full-service dive shop on the grounds that offers instruction and
equipment rental.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular dive trips is to swim or snorkel with
the manatees in the Crystal River. The inn's brochure points out
that the river is home to more manatees than any other spot in
Florida. If you want to see manatees but not be in the water with
them, bring your camera as you walk along the river as it wraps
around the inn.
</P>
<P>
   The sea cows often can be seen meandering in the clear water.
Sit near the gazebo at sunset, and you'll find that the changing
light makes the reflection of each cloud a possible manatee
sighting.
</P>
<P>
   Is that one?
</P>
<P>
   I spotted three, maybe four. Or maybe none.
</P>
<P>
   Boat rentals and guided tours are available at the inn's marina,
allowing you to explore the extensive river system for an hour or a
day. Screw a telephoto lens onto your camera or take along
binoculars and enjoy the enormous variety of birds in the area.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer to stay close to the inn, there are all-weather,
lighted tennis courts, volleyball courts, croquet, shuffleboard and
an 18-hole championship golf course. I favored the golf, which is
within walking distance of the main building even when carrying
your bag. The pro shop is large and well-stocked, and features a
restaurant with decent clubhouse food and a friendly bar.
</P>
<P>
   For more formal dining, try the Plantation Room restaurant in
the main building. It overlooks the river, pool and the poolside
bar _ Alligator Annie's. The service was slow even though only a

 &HT;    What if you tried to change the world - and did?
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Simon &AMP; Schuster is betting a lot on
``Pay It Forward,'' and so far the book is living up to their
expectations. The Book of the Month Club has taken it, and Kevin
Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment are making the movie for
Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   And you can see why, for this is a powerful narrative with an
idealistic idea grounded in familiar characters.
</P>
<P>
   The story: A schoolteacher in a small California town gives his
class an extra-credit project: Come up with an idea that can change
the world.
</P>
<P>
   A boy named Trevor actually does. He devises a chain letter of
deeds _ one person does a nice thing for, say, three people, with
the proviso that they pay it forward, not back _ that is, those
first three each have to do a nice thing for three other people,
those nine each do something nice for another three apiece, and so
forth.
</P>
<P>
   The geometrical implications are obvious; at the 16th level,
about 43 million people are suddenly basking in random acts of
kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor's project doesn't start out well _ the first recipient of
Trevor's goodwill is a con on parole who collapses into recidivism;
the second is an old lady who dies. But just when Trevor is ready
to give up, his idea takes hold, is smelled out by an inquiring
reporter, and a worldwide movememt leads him to the White House and
a beaming Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those modern fables that seek to recapture the
messianic message of Frank Capra, circa ``Meet John Doe'' _ to
convince us that, beneath the vast panoply of avarice and cunning
on daily display, a single human being can make a difference, that
heaven can be right here on Earth. Catherine Ryan Hyde believes the
same thing Anne Frank did: that people are basically good at heart.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with most of these books _ ``The Christmas Box,''
``The Celestine Prophecy'' et al. _ is that they never quite get
where they're going. The ideas may be Capraesque, but the execution
isn't, and neither are the times. They're like Capra, but they're
not Capra.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your own emotional equation and vulnerabilities,
the reader either buys into them or not; questions of literary
quality seldom enter into such decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The characters of ``Pay It Forward'' are all overly familiar
types _ the Vietnam vet whose internal scars are even more horrific
than the external; the harried but well-meaning blue-collar mother;
the cynical, busted journalist _ but what Hyde does with them is
less familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay It Forward'' is much more subtly written than other
inspirational books, with believable dialogue and shadings that
make the characters seem more lifelike than they have any right to
be:
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't sure if he was asleep. She allowed herself to drift
into a feeling, a sense, that she somehow watched all this from
above. Not so much physically, but more in a sense of perspective
... She wondered if she would remember this feeling next time
something seemed, in the short run, to be going wrong. She knew she
probably would not. She knew people transcended that line of
knowledge all the time, but damned if they didn't tend to cross
right back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Until an ending that strikes me as an error in judgment _ let's
just say that Trevor is too rarified for this dirty world, just
like his most illustriously selfless predecessor _ Catherine Ryan
Hyde accomplishes a very difficult job, with an easy, benificent
wisdom about the ways of the world:
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't get,'' one character thinks, ``we see everywhere
we look. What we won't let ourselves do, be, we refuse to tolerate
in any other living soul.''

 &HT;    Biography follows life on an intrepid traveler
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``One life is an absurdly small
allowance,'' wrote Freya Stark in a letter to a friend in 1929, and
the woman who emerges from this quick-paced biography seems to have
lived hers like a whirling dervish.
</P>
<P>
   Stark was a fascinating, fearless, homely woman, made homelier
by a ghastly accident suffered at age 12, when her long hair was
caught in large, rapidly spinning power wheel in a mill owned by
her stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Before she could be freed, the remorseless wheel tore off half
her scalp, one of her eyelids and her right ear. She had to wear
her hair brushed over one side of her head for the rest of her
life, to hide the horrible scars.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I should really have liked, is to be very pretty,'' Stark
confided to a friend. She was ashamed of her plainness, yet it
proved a blessing in disguise: It drove her to excel in the
wilderness, far from domesticity.
</P>
<P>
   She learned Arabic, learned how to use a compass and sextant,
read and wrote voluminously, lived to be 100 and left behind 22
books and eight volumes of letters detailing her journeys to such
places as Luristan, Hadhramaut, Yemen, the Elburz mountains,
Ctesiphon, Baghdad and Oman. Some are still in print, and their
titles are stirring: ``The Valleys of the Assassins,'' ``Dust in
the Lion's Paw,'' ``The Minaret of Djam,'' ``Riding to the Tigris''
and ``The Southern Gates of Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   She traveled intrepidly, openly, as a woman, often alone,
through Muslim countries where women were little more than
property. She rubbed shoulders with bandits and devil-worshipers
out of the pages of Kipling. She was honored with the gold medal of
the Royal Geographic Society, performed valuable intelligence work
during World War II and championed the rights of Arabs in Palestine
_ views that made her extremely unpopular in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Biographer Jane Geniesse brings Stark thrillingly to life, yet
does not idolize or soft-focus her subject. She peers deeply into
Stark's personal life, bringing out shortcomings as well as
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Stark could be manipulative, jealous, mean-spirited, devious.
She tended to use people as long as they were useful, then drop
them. She was a self-promoter who often overdramatized her
achievements. She was almost never the first explorer to visit a
place, and often she wasn't even the first woman to get there.
Twice, she had to be ingloriously airlifted by the Royal Air Force
out of tight spots she'd gotten herself into.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evacuate! Evacuate! A maiden most immaculate!'' British
officials gibed behind her back.
</P>
<P>
   What Stark was, was a gifted gleaner. She came along in the late
afternoon of the British Empire and vacuumed up the last, rich
crumbs of discovery from regions of the world that had been poorly
mapped, or poorly understood, then made them come brilliantly alive
in trenchant, descriptive prose for armchair travelers back home.
</P>
<P>
   She reminds you, at times, of a female Richard Halliburton or
Lowell Thomas, though smarter and more complex. She was brave,
imaginative, fiercely competitive. Above all she possessed the gift
of firing the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Men found her fascinating, despite her looks. She attracted a
series of older men, scholars, aesthetes, authors, explorers and
businessmen, to act as her patrons and protectors, though when she
finally married, late in life, she chose as her husband a former
diplomat, Stewart Perowne, an agonized, guilt-ridden, closet
homosexual. The marriage lasted only a few months, and Geniesse
describes it with great feeling and understanding for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to feel,'' Stark wrote to a friend after her first few
successful journeys, ``that I had missed the real reason of life by
not marrying, and was out of the stream in a backwater, as it were.
But now I feel this is not so. I think that the human being is just
coming to that point where we are just stepping along into a wider
world, and need not fear being lonely, except in the way that
pioneers are lonely. Life is easier for married people: but I think
it ought to be if anything richer for us, as long as we take it
with full hands and not with the inferiority sense which has often
ruined the lives of spinsters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Though personally,'' she added, ``I would like to be
married.''
</P>
<P>
   If the book has a flaw, it is that it doesn't quote its subject
enough. Geniesse's excerpts from Stark's writings are tantalizing,
enough to make you greedy for more, but too few to satisfy
completely. Rather, she wings through the closing decades of
Stark's life in too great a hurry, disposing of whole journeys and
books in a few lines. The book is very smartly paced throughout,
never a dull moment, but at the end, the pace escalates from smart
to breakneck.
</P>
<P>
   Aged and laden with honors, Stark summed up the rewards and
penalties of longevity in a single, brilliant simile:
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting for death, my dear, is very much like being in an
old-fashioned steam train, setting out on a journey. You let down
the window by a leather strap, and your friends are on the platform
waving goodbye. And then the blasted train doesn't move.''

 &HT;    Turow providing competition to other `lawyer fiction'
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most authors of popular suspense and mystery novels seem to be
written by lawyers these days. Some are better than others, and of
course, some are worse. But they both seem to be selling well, so
it's no surprise that lawyers from coast to coast are trying their
wits and self-discipline at fiction.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about it, this should come as no surprise.
Lawyers are closely related to fiction writers as well as actors in
temperament and inclinations. In other words they're full of B.S.
and, if an audience gathers, can turn into extroverts regardless of
their private personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most widely known and maybe most popular
lawyer/novelist today is John Grisham, despite the fact that many
critics denounce his work as unworthy of serious consideration. I'm
not one of those. His stories keep me reading and that's one way to
judge good writing, in my opinion. Not the only way by any means,
but one of several to measure what someone has managed to put on
paper.
</P>
<P>
   But my favorite lawyer/novelists are Scott Turow and Robert K.
Tanenbaum. Both are head and shoulders above Grisham in most every
way you should judge a writer.
</P>
<P>
   Turow has recently come out with a new novel titled ``Personal
Injuries'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux). It's his fifth and, at
least at the present time (having just finished reading it), I rate
it as his best, although ``Burden of Proof'' and ``Presumed
Innocent'' are excellent, too. Well, heck, they're all excellent.
</P>
<P>
   As are all Turow's stories (and most of the other stories by
lawyer/writers), ``Personal Injuries'' is about the practice of law
and those who do it for a living. Probably the one thing, if there
is only one thing, that sets Turow's books apart from the others by
his fellow lawyer/writers are his characters. His books, that is to
say, are character-driven rather than plot-driven _ not that the
plots are weak. They aren't, but they usually have more to do with
the strengths and weaknesses of the characters than such stuff as
action and physical suspense. There's plenty of suspense, but most
of it, almost all of it in fact, is psychological and moral
suspense. How will the people you've come to know so well and care
for so much react when the chips are really down? How will they
respond to this or that temptation or action?
</P>
<P>
   In ``Personal Injuries'', Robbie Feaver (pronounced ``favor'')
is a highly successful personal injury lawyer. He is a womanizer
with a wife who has an incurable illness and grows weaker by the
day. He has a secret bank account where he sometimes deposits money
that makes its way to the pockets of judges who decide Robbie's
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Robbie is busted by a special government task force and, in
exchange for a promise of leniency, agrees to wear a wire as he
goes about the business of fixing his upcoming court decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a jerk and crook? The truth is the reader and FBI
agent, female, assigned to stick close to him to make certain he
does what he's supposed to do and doesn't blow his cover, slowly
learns to love the guy. Like the characters in the old Kris
Kristofferson song, he's a walking contradiction, partly truth and
partly fiction.
</P>
<P>
   This book is primarily Robbie's story, but it's almost equally
the story of Evon, the FBI agent whose life is changed forever by
her association with Robbie, but not in the way you'll assume in
the earlier stages of the story.
</P>
<P>
   I recommend this one without hesitation or reservations. If you
love finely tuned provocative writing, this one's for you.

 &HT;    Bush prefers big picture, delegating the details
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When he first ran for governor in 1994, George
W. Bush made the campaign appearances. But most of the campaign
nuts and bolts were delegated to key aides: political guru Karl
Rove, campaign manager Joe Allbaugh, press aide Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush became governor, Allbaugh became chief of staff and
Hughes, communications director. Rove directed Bush's political
operation as a consultant but spent a lot of time at the Capitol.
The trio became known as ``The Iron Triangle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was the big-picture guy, his staffers say, sitting in on
policy meetings. But he delegated most details of pet issues, such
as tax cuts, and all of the details of smaller ones not on his
priority list. Meanwhile, the governor pursued ``retail''
one-on-one politicking with legislators, using his prominence and
engaging personality to push his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has the same approach and same people in charge in his
presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, there's not any difference,'' said Allbaugh.
``Basically, he still sets the agenda and figures out the broad
goal that he's trying to achieve and directs staff to implement it.
That hasn't changed one bit, and it's been very successful for the
past six years that I've been lucky enough to be with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas at Austin government
professor and presidential scholar, wonders how much is Bush and
how much is his handlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the evidence that I can see seems to be that he delegates
to a degree that it's hard for me to see where his advisers end and
he begins,'' Buchanan said. ``It looks like a group project, and
it's hard to find evidence of his guiding hand. ... Other people
put words in his mouth all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's defeat by Arizona Sen. John McCain in New Hampshire's GOP
primary Feb. 1 shocked people inside and outside government who had
endorsed Bush The Inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were suggesting that what he should do when he got
whipped in New Hampshire was to fire a bunch of people,'' Buchanan
said. ``And he didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush, who believes in loyalty, consulted with the same
trusted staffers _ plus Mark McKinnon, who did TV ads in his 1998
re-election and is back for the big race. They retooled his
campaign to make him The Reformer With Results.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hires people that he believes in and trusts, and then he
delegates,'' said McKinnon. ``He doesn't micro-manage. He invests a
lot of trust and faith in people to do their job, but he expects
them to do it well, and he expects results.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he very much empowers people, and there is also not a lot
of second-guessing,'' McKinnon said. Bush is personally secure, so
``when things don't go well, there's not a lot of finger-pointing
and blame.''
</P>
<P>
   And so now the cautious campaign that had tried to keep the Bush
message focused on a few issues like tax cuts and compassionate
conservatism has decided it has no choice but to copy McCain's more
open-ended town-hall approach.
</P>
<P>
   Now the nation will see if Bush the Delegator can show enough
substance to compare well to Senate veteran McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although he's taking more questions, he's not as free-floating
by any means as John McCain,'' said Buchanan. ``He doesn't wing it
that much.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush was combative in Tuesday's CNN debate, at times
he looked frantic and desperate against McCain's seasoned debate
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Allbaugh insists Bush's delegative style isn't a campaign
defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's a very quick study,'' Allbaugh said. ``And the
volume of material he riffles through is just so large that I don't
believe that's a hindrance at all. The American public wants a
president to be as widely versed in as many issues as possible, but
I think they also understand that a president can't be an expert on
every issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're mainly interested in an individual who can
make good decisions based on sound judgment. And I would point to
the governor's last five years as Texas' chief executive officer as
the best preparation to become the president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The retooled Bush will find in the next few days whether he can
convince enough voters of that.

 &HT;    Better late than never: Man plays college basketball at 32
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael Baldwin was in Kitzinger, Germany, serving his
country as a member of the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   Future Lincoln County High basketball star Antonio Henderson was
a first-grader whose travel experiences had not yet included the
big city of Atlanta, some 120 miles west of his Lincolnton
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a decade and a half later, Henderson and Baldwin _
separated by 12 years and distinctive mindsets _ are together as
peers on the basketball team at Atlanta Metropolitan College.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Henderson, 20, one of the nation's leading
junior-college scorers with a 26-point average, who is the veteran
in organized basketball experience.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Henderson, a sophomore guard, says about Baldwin, ``He
brings a lot of maturity and continuity to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never played the game in the high school because back then I
wasn't interested,'' Baldwin said. ``I was not the player type, but
I could talk the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Since those days at Tuskegee (Ala.) Institute High in the
mid-1980s, the son of a career military man has gone through many
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, 32, is married and the father of three. He is studying
computer engineering while he continues his military connection
through the Army Reserve. He hopes to reap full retirement benefits
in six or seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I joined the Army in November of '85,'' said Baldwin, who was
following the lead of his father, Melvin, a missile expert. ``I got
interested in basketball after I got to Germany in June of '86. I
was a tank mechanic and when I wasn't fixing tanks, I was in the
gym. There was nothing else to do at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 5 and 190 pounds, Baldwin, still a teen-ager, found
that he had ``game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pickup basketball, then company league and
tournaments,'' he said. ``I found out that I pretty much had what
it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin continued to play frequently, even after marrying a
former Texas-El Paso track star in October 1991 while stationed at
Fort Bliss in Texas. And when daughters DeJonee, now 8, and Renee,
4, and son Michael Jr., 3, came along, Baldwin's interest in
basketball waned only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my experience in Germany, I began to wonder if I could
play at a college, any college,'' Baldwin said. ``To me, it really
didn't matter who I'd play for. I just wanted to be able to say
that at least I got a chance to play college ball for one year.''
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of wife Demetrice, who assured him that she
would give him full support, Baldwin decided in the fall to try out
for the team at Atlanta Metropolitan College. He already was taking
courses there, hoping to enroll later at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hesitant at first, but I told him to go for it, because
if he didn't he might regret it the rest of his life,'' said
Demetrice, who competed in the 400 meters, long jump and triple
jump at UTEP.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was really encouraging,'' said Baldwin, who moved his
family to Atlanta three years ago. ``She told me to just go out and
do what I had been doing on the court for the last 10 or 11
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, competing for a spot against players years younger, was
impressive enough to make the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lively body and he's extremely quick on his feet _
really talented for a guy who is 32 years old,'' Atlanta Metro
coach Robert Pritchett said. ``But what impressed me most was his
intensity. At his age, it's got to be his love for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said, ``We look at him, and we know when to stop
kidding around and get serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin acknowledges that, 20 games into his first and perhaps
last season as a college player, he is still trying to find his
place. Never mind that he has averaged seven rebounds and six
points while playing 25 minutes per game. A comfort zone on the
court has been elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't found my niche yet,'' he said. ``So I really
try to do the little things _ like take the charge, dive for the
loose ball and battle for every rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be construed as the downside of Baldwin's college
basketball experience. Part of the upside is the Baldwin cheering
section.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of the children can't wait to get to the gym on game
nights,'' Demetrice said. ``The most excited is Michael Jr., who
makes sure that everybody knows that that's his daddy on the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin said, ``I really thought it would be tough juggling
athletics, class work, fatherhood and wifehood. But it's been a lot
of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And inspiration, Pritchett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see a young family with that kind of togetherness and
commitment is quite refreshing,'' Pritchett said. ``It really
doesn't matter whether or not Michael plays after this season. The
kind of person he is, especially with his family, will probably
have a big impact on the rest of the players on the team a long way
down the road.''

 &HT;    Appealing options to swing (the clubs) on Nature Coast
 &HT;    By Louis Hillary Park
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CITRUS SPRINGS, Fla. _ If you want to play a devil of a golf
course, El Diablo is the place to go.
</P>
<P>
   Recently chosen by Golf Digest magazine as the No. 1 New
(Affordable) Course in America, El Diablo is 7,045 yards of
perfectly manicured fairways that undulate through the piney woods
like a rattlesnake on the prowl. Smooth and deliberate. And silent.
Situated in this tiny Central Florida hamlet with almost no
development around the course, El Diablo is as pristine and
beautiful as it is challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely critical as to what people see when they come
in here,'' says course superintendent and assistant manager Don
Maidlow, who built the first 27 holes at the ultra-exclusive Black
Diamond Ranch in nearby Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   But El Diablo is not the only quality course vacationers can
play in the area. Golden Ocala, just northwest of its namesake
city, has plenty of challenges of its own, plus borrows a few from
other, more famous courses including Augusta National, St. Andrews
and Baltusrol.
</P>
<P>
   Both courses are within an hour's drive of Crystal River and the
Plantation Inn. If you don't want to drive, the inn has a
well-staffed and maintained par 72 championship course that plays
host annually to the Florida Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a nine-hole executive course used by the teaching
pros at The Original Golf School, which makes its winter home at
the inn. Led by Jay Morelli, named the New England PGA Teacher of
the Year, the school prides itself on a 4-to-1 pro to student
ratio.
</P>
<P>
   While the pros at the Plantation Inn may teach weekend golfers a
better swing, El Diablo can teach humility to even
low-handicappers, but with six tees, the course can be a
comfortable fit for almost any level of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cater to the ladies,'' says Maidlow, who has planted 26,000
azaleas among the high rolling hills that give depth to some holes
and hilltop views to others.
</P>
<P>
   From the red tees, El Diablo plays at 5,144 yards, almost 2,000
yards shorter than from the gold. I played from the whites (6,232
yards) and it still was plenty of golf course, but a fair one.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Jim Fazio, older brother of the more famous Tom, the
course does not blind you with doglegs or force you to carry acres
of water to reach fairways. In fact, there is water on only one
hole, the signature 11th _ a 392-yard, uphill par 4. Instead,
Fazio, who also designed the new Trump International course in West
Palm Beach, used the natural contours of the rolling land and
well-placed native-sand waste bunkers to make this a thinker's
course.
</P>
<P>
   More of a rear-back-and-hit-it course, Golden Ocala has a layout
that can be overpowered by big hitters. With fairways that leave
room for error, the attraction of the 6,735-yard course is a chance
to play some holes the average golfer likely will never lay eyes on
except on television.
</P>
<P>
   Hole 6 replicates Augusta's 16th, and 11 and 12 are copies of 12
and 13 _ the Amen Corner of the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest hole on the course is No. 15, a copy of the fourth
hole at Baltusrol _ a 209-yard par 3. Hitting from an elevated tee,
you must carry a wide pond then hold the ball on a narrow green.
</P>
<P>
   After playing El Diablo or Golden Ocala, give yourself a break
and tee off at the Plantation Inn course.
</P>
<P>
   While beautifully maintained, it is typical of older Florida
coastal courses _ flat, short (6,161 yards from the white tees),
with tightly grouped fairways and greens. Water is the course's
biggest challenge, with hazards guarding 14 holes.

 &HT;    Gisele a favorite, but new crop of models set fashion runways
aflame
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the fall fashion shows wrapped up in Bryant Park
last week, we polled a dozen front-row habitues about which models
they favored and why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gisele, Gisele, Gisele. Who doesn't love Gisele?'' said
Glamour's Suzanne Yalof. (After a week of watching, editors get to
know models on a first-name basis _ that's how they're referred to
in the designer's program note.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Who couldn't be in love with Gisele?'' echoed Andre Leon
Talley of Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-brainer _ Gisele by far,'' said Linda Wells of
Allure. ``Aren't you going to get the same answer from everyone?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no. While the tanned, curvy cover girl, also the
hands-down favorite of photographers, topped almost everyone's
list, her skyrocketing fees meant she was seen far less this season
than last.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers reported that she stormed out of the Helmut Lang show
when the designer downgraded her number of appearances. Stephanie
Seymour and Claudia Schiffer, in rare runway showings, had to pick
up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   At other shows, lesser-known models stepped in her place.
``Gisele is amazing,'' said Evyan Metzner of Mademoiselle. ``But
she's everywhere, so it's nice to see new girls.''
</P>
<P>
   While they're all super-tall, downright skinny and blessed with
perfectly symmetrical features, what the models-with-the-mostest
share is their individuality. A trademark expression. A quirk of
personality that's communicated without a word. Simple stage
presence that never upstages the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   A look that says, again and again, ``Look at me.... And love
what I'm wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BOMBSHELL
</P>
<P>
   With a voluptuous figure that makes her stand out as a
well-nourished woman in a field of anemic-looking little girls,
Gisele Bundchen comes across as pure force of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``She radiates a light and optimism and sexuality,'' says
Vogue's Talley. ``And her body is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Ralph Lauren tapped her to wear a gold mesh bikini
top and gold leather skirt for Fashion Week. And Donna Karan
dressed her in a stretchy red halter dress. She's stayed busy the
rest of the year with back-to-back covers for Vogue, W and Harper's
Bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   It's her curvaceous body, though, that sends designers
scurrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designers tend to save their va-va-va-voom looks for her,''
says Cindy Weber Cleary of InStyle magazine.
</P>
<P>
   THE GROUNDBREAKER
</P>
<P>
   When she debuted several seasons ago, Sudan-born Alek Wek
changed standards of what was considered beautiful. Her distinctly
African features _ cherubic cheeks, broad nose and full lips _ and
coal-black skin stood out in a field of WASP-y American models. And
Alek's hair is cropped so short she almost appears bald.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dumbfounded at BCBG when she came out with hair,'' says
trend forecaster Tom Julian, who chose her as a favorite (Wek wore
a wig for the show). ``The clothes work for her, and she works for
the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Talley says, ``She's broken barriers not only of color but of
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Alek has worked for Gucci, Fendi, Galliano and Chanel, and has
inked contracts with Clinique and Moschino.
</P>
<P>
   (The scuttlebutt during Fashion Week was whether Alek has had
liposuction. Her formerly prominent behind is flatter now, but some
think it's just hard work at the gym.)
</P>
<P>
   THE NEXT BIG THING
</P>
<P>
   Like Gisele, Caroline Ribiero hails from Brazil, and she is
being heralded as the new face to watch. She's 5-foot-11,
swizzle-stick thin and with a face that can look sultry in one
show, regal in the next, and girl-next-door in the third.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike some mannequins, it's impossible to mistake Caroline
for anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love her kind of exotic looks,'' says celebrity stylist
Phillip Bloch.
</P>
<P>
   She has a face that resists easy categorization, he says.
``She's undefinable, and that's what I think is so beautiful about
her.''

 &HT;    Competition rocketing in Hollywood as studios seek galactic
blockbusters
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Forget the United States and Russia. The space
race is between Disney and Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   More than three decades after the Cold War contest to put the
first man on the moon, the rival studios are battling to land the
first of two big Mars movies in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling dramas _ Disney's ``Mission to Mars'' and Warners'
``Red Planet'' _ follow a tradition that in recent years has seen
competing films about asteroids (``Armageddon,'' ``Sudden
Impact''), volcanos (``Dante's Peak,'' ``Volcano''), Olympic runner
Steve Prefontaine (``Prefontaine,'' ``Without Limits'') and
computer-animated insects (``A Bug's Life,'' ``Antz'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission to Mars'' and ``Red Planet'' are just the first two
Mars-related movie projects cleared by Hollywood mission control.
Directors James Cameron (``Titanic'') and John Carpenter
(``Halloween'') also have Mars films in the works.
</P>
<P>
   A host of other space-themed films are also set to blast into
theaters this year, as studios attempt to cash in on the public's
fascination with the 1997 Mars Sojourner mission and the success of
blockbusters such as ``Apollo 13'' and ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black,'' a sci-fi horror movie about nasty nocturnal
aliens, opens today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' will star Clint Eastwood and Tommy Lee Jones
as retired astronauts called back into service, a la John Glenn.
John Travolta and Garry Shandling will play extraterrestrials in
``Battlefield Earth'' and ``What Planet Are You From?'',
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Disney-Warners race, ``Mission to Mars'' will touch
down first on March 10. Director Brian De Palma reportedly
delivered the sci-fi adventure, which stars Tim Robbins and Gary
Sinise, two months ahead of schedule. It was originally slated for
summer release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Planet,'' starring Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore, was
rumored to be rocketing to an even earlier launch date. Instead,
its release was recently pushed back to Nov. 10 from June 16.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mars movies deal with the first manned missions to Earth's
nearest neighboring planet and subsequent rescue attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Like NASA's real-life Mars missions, both have faced their share
of setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   De Palma stepped in when ``Mission to Mars''' original director,
Gore Verbinski (``Mouse Hunt''), departed over budget concerns.
Actress Connie Nielsen (``The Devil's Advocate'') replaced Monica
Potter (``Patch Adams''), who abandoned her astronaut suit for the
lead role in a romantic comedy, ``Head Over Heels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Planet,'' the feature debut of commercial director Antony
Hoffman, lost the NASA approval it shared with ``Mission to Mars''
in a dispute over a murder scene. Prickly stars Kilmer and Sizemore
have been feuding, according to set reports posted by Survive Mars,
a Web site devoted to the production of both films, as well as
Cameron's.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy Award-winning ``Titanic'' director is producing a
television miniseries and a short IMAX 3-D movie, which he will
direct, for 2001. Both of Cameron's projects deal with the first
manned mission to Mars _ and a subsequent rescue attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter is in pre-production on ``Ghosts of Mars,'' also due
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick countdown of this year's space movies. As with
NASA missions, launch dates are subject to change.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Pitch Black''
</P>
<P>
   Director: David Twohy
</P>
<P>
   Cast: Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David.
</P>
<P>
   Having learned nothing from ``Alien'' and ``Starship Troopers,''
space pilot Fry (Mitchell) crash-lands her vessel on a seemingly
uninhabited planet. The survivors include a lawman (Hauser) and his
murderous prisoner (Diesel). They must all band together once the
planet's sun goes down and its nocturnal inhabitants emerge. (Opens
today.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``What Planet Are You From?''
</P>
<P>
   Director: Mike Nichols
</P>
<P>
   Cast: Garry Shandling, Annette Bening, John Goodman, Greg
Kinnear.
</P>
<P>
   Shandling (HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show'') co-wrote this
battle-of-the-sexes comedy, in which he stars as an alien sent to
Earth to impregnate a woman (Bening) to perpetuate his all-male
race. His E.T. proves to be as inept at human courting and mating
as the typical earthling. (March 3)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Mission to Mars''
</P>
<P>
   Director: Brian De Palma
</P>
<P>
   Cast: Tim Robbins, Gary Sinise, Don Cheadle, Connie Nielsen,
Jerry O'Connell.
</P>
<P>
   When the first manned mission to Mars meets with a mysterious
disaster, a rescue mission is launched to investigate the tragedy
and bring back any survivors. As the Toronto Star put it, ``It's
pretty clear De Palma has decided to stop ripping off Hitchcock for
once so that he can remake Kubrick's `2001: A Space Odyssey.'''
(March 10)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Battlefield Earth''
</P>
<P>
   Director: Roger Christian
</P>
<P>
   Cast: John Travolta, Barry Pepper, Forest Whitaker, Kim Coates,
Kelly Preston.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta, a noted Scientologist, stars as the leader of an evil
alien race on a quest for global domination in this sci-fi thriller
based on a novel by Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.
Pepper (``Saving Private Ryan'') plays a young man who leaves his
desolate home high in the Rocky Mountains to take a final,
courageous stand. (May 5)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Space Cowboys''
</P>
<P>
   Director: Clint Eastwood
</P>
<P>
   Cast: Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, James
Garner, James Cromwell.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood and Jones spike their Tang with Geritol and blast off
for adventure as two aging NASA veterans recommissioned for one
last mission. Eastwood reportedly rejected the film's premise
before John Glenn's 1998 return to space at age 77, fearing that no
one would believe the notion of a senior citizen going into space.
(Aug. 4)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Red Planet''
</P>
<P>
   Director: Antony Hoffman
</P>
<P>
   Cast: Val Kilmer, Carrie-Anne Moss, Tom Sizemore, Benjamin
Bratt, Simon Baker, Terence Stamp.
</P>
<P>
   A team of U.S. astronauts, not sporting the NASA logo, makes the
first manned expedition to Mars in an attempt to colonize the
planet. When their equipment suffers life-threatening damage, the
crew struggles for survival on the hostile surface of Mars,
reportedly fighting each other _ and killer space worms. (Nov. 16)

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I have an addiction.
Actually, I have several, but let's not go there. I have become
obsessed with ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire.'' I rarely miss an
episode. (Gary Borders is editor and publisher of the Nacogdoches
Daily Sentinel.) EMBARGOED for Sunday. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ George W. Bush is the big-picture guy as Texas
governor, his staffers say, sitting in on policy meetings. But he
delegated most details of pet issues. Meanwhile, the governor
pursued ``retail'' one-on-one politicking with legislators, using
his prominence and engaging personality to push his priorities.
Bush has the same approach and same people in charge in his
presidential run. (McNeely, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Bush can still win in South
Carolina. The abdication of the hunt by Steve Forbes may be his
saving grace. Should Bush win the nomination, however, he has some
groveling to do to get back to the center. (John Young is opinion
page editor of the Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   GOTTLIEB-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ For a while there, this
political season was upsetting the best _ and one of most unknown _
rules of presidential politics. To wit, presidential nomination
fights are about credentials. (Gottlieb, Dayton Daily News) MOVED

   RESTAURANTS-BDAY _ Restaurants love to celebrate patrons'
birthdays. Oddly, though, many don't like to sing ``Happy
Birthday.'' One reason is that the venerable song is still
copyrighted, and restaurants could be sued. Another is that they
like to come up with theme songs for their own chains; Longhorn
Steakhouse's song ends with ``hot damn!'' and Red Lobster's
finishes with ``come back soon and eat more fish.'' (Harris,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 26. WITH PHOTO. MOVED

   TRAVEL-CROATIA _ DUBROVNIK, Croatia _ Dubrovnik's claim to fame

17th centuries. Today the main purpose of the walls is to provide
visitors a glimpse of a history. (Keller, Dayton Daily News

EDITORIAL: DEATH OF A GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Feb. 17:
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Esperanza Garden, a community garden on East
Seventh Street in Manhattan, was bulldozed after 22 years of
existence. Its destruction marked the latest battle in the
long-running war between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and community
advocates over the use of city-owned lots for community gardens.
City Hall contends that many lots were only lent to the
neighborhoods for gardens with the understanding that they would
ultimately be taken back. Now, the mayor says, the lot on East
Seventh Street should be sold to a developer to build low- and
middle-income housing.
</P>
<P>
   But the developer for this lot has set aside only 20 percent of
the planned housing units for low-income housing. The rest will be
made available as the market dictates. There are also provisions
for nearly 7,000 square feet of retail space and 5,000 square feet
of permanent open space. The fate of Esperanza Garden had been
decided during a series of public hearings intended, in the
administration's words, to balance competing interests, though it
is not clear how the users of a community garden can compete with
the economic clout of a developer.
</P>
<P>
   No city ownership right can quite absolve the mayor and his
administration of insensitivity in their handling of community
gardens. ``If you live in an unrealistic world then you can say
everything should be a community garden,'' the mayor said. But
their defenders do not claim that everything should be a community
garden. They only claim that such gardens, rare as they are, bring
vitality and a sense of purpose to neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict underlying the destruction of Esperanza Garden
seems more fundamental than a struggle between gardeners and
developers, green space and housing. It seems to be a conflict
about the expression of public will. In most cases, the mayor
clearly tries to take the broad view of what is best for most New
Yorkers. Not every community garden will survive in an economic
climate as ebullient and a housing market as tight as this one. But
the most meaningful definition of public value is not always the
broadest or most economically justifiable one. A patch of green or
a plot of flowers can often do more for a neighborhood than new
apartments and retail establishments.

Monday, Feb. 1, The New York times Syndicate is offering a
five-part feature, ``The Caldwell Journals,'' an account of major
moments in the civil-rights movement of the 1960s by Earl Caldwell,
the nationally acclaimed black journalist whose early career was
shaped by that dynamic era. Caldwell, a former New York Times
reporter, was witness to some of the most important events of the
last 40 years. He covered the riots that swept many American cities
during the summer of 1967. In 1995, the National Association of
Black Journalists presented Caldwell with its President's Award,
saying his record of professional achievement made him ``one of the
most important journalists in the last 50 years.'' Caldwell is
currently a writer-in-residence at the Robert C. Maynard Institute
for Journalism Education in Oakland, Calif., and is writing ``The
Caldwell Journals'' for the institute's Web site. For purchase

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART TWO: On a hot night in Harlem in July 1964, the
explosion came. After a white police officer had shot and killed a
black youth, riots erupted in the black neighborhoods in the
northeast _ a portent of what was to come. At the Democrat and
Chronicle, the city editor called Earl Caldwell to his desk. ``We
want you to go down to Harlem,'' he said. Although Caldwell had
visited New York, he had never been to Harlem. He grabbed a
notebook and a few clothes and headed for the airport, hoping that
his experience in Rochester had prepared him for the challenge in
New York City. Here, Caldwell describes what it was like for him
and other black reporters in Harlem during the riots, which raged
around them for three nights.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The rioting in Harlem came in furious bursts. Rocks and bottles
sailed from tenement roofs. Molotov cocktails exploded on streets
littered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Cops fired salvo after salvo into smoky, pitch-black skies.
Police cruisers, sirens wailing, roared in pursuit of hit-and-run
looters.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds lined the streets, sometimes as many as a thousand
people, all of them black. They screamed, jeered, ducked, dodged
and _ when turned on by riot-weary cops _ scrambled and ran.
</P>
<P>
   And there we were, smack in the middle of it, with notebooks in
hand, dashing at the heels of the crowds, observing the battles and
trying as best we could to record it all.
</P>
<P>
   Frenzied as it was in those moments of battle, that's all they
were, moments. They would rise like a storm and then, just as
suddenly, dissipate. And with every inevitable lull in the action,
attention turned to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' people demanded. Some would reach for the press
credentials that dangled from our necks.
</P>
<P>
   We tried to explain ourselves. ``We're press,'' we said. But
that was not nearly explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What press?'' our inquisitors fired back.
</P>
<P>
   In that back-and-forth, something that even we had not realized
came into focus. Harlem cops and black residents had seen black
reporters before. But almost without exception those reporters
worked for black newspapers, mainly weeklies. This time we
represented mainstream white-owned daily newspapers and radio
stations, a major first.
</P>
<P>
   A small colony of reporters who were black had arrived in the
big leagues of New York City journalism. And this took everyone by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Having come from Rochester, I was as astonished as the police
and the blacks on the streets to see at least a dozen or so
reporters, all black like me, representing large and powerful
organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated Press, the
New York Post, the Daily News, United Press International, Newsday,
and Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In that week, I came to know reporters such as Gerald Fraser,
Austin Scott, Ted Poston, Tom Johnson, Les Carson, Claude Lewis,
Ted Jones, Junius Griffin, Wally Terry, Paul Hathaway, Gene Simpson
and Stan Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And on the streets of Harlem, between bursts of rioting, we
acknowledged with one another that we were a part of a bit of
history.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that we were there. What was developing into one
of the biggest stories in America was largely in our hands. The
events unfolding on the streets of Harlem would make news all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been little more than a mere footnote but it was
still a piece of history in the making. Never had the major media
put so much of an important story in the hands of reporters who
were not white.
</P>
<P>
   Every chance they got, the cops would stare us down. It was as
though they could not accept that we were qualified and that our
reporting would be central to what people everywhere would read of
the Harlem riots.
</P>
<P>
   Some white reporters sought us out. They would shake our hands
and stay as close to us as possible. That put them closer to the
story. It also made them feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a white New York Times photographer was jumped by a mob
and beaten so badly that the bones around his eyes were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had two black reporters on the story, Junius Griffin
and Ted Jones, who set up a temporary bureau in the Theresa Hotel
at 125th Street and 7th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was a former Marine. He broke in as a journalist on
Stars and Stripes, the United States military newspaper. In Harlem,
he emerged a hero. He saw a group of blacks surround and threaten
three white reporters from the Journal-American, a Hearst
newspaper. He charged into the crowd, grabbed the reporters, and
walked them out unharmed. He knew that only a black reporter could
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jones made news too. He watched some cops chasing black
youths who had been throwing rocks and bottles. As the kids outran
the cops and got away, some in the crowd cheered derisively. In
frustration, the cops began to use their nightsticks at random.
Impulsively, Ted interceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people didn't do anything,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   When the cops ignored him and continued swinging their batons
wildly, he pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to beat these people,'' he insisted. ``You
cannot do that. You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' a cop barked, irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Ted grabbed his press card and held it out. ``The New York
Times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here,'' the cop ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and heavyset, Ted refused to budge. As the cops continued
their attack, he was knocked to the ground. He wasn't injured, only
shook up, but what happened to him became a part of the news story.
</P>
<P>
   The riots raged through three nights, and at the end of each
day, long after the crowds and the cops had drifted away, the
reporters would still be on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   We could sense that something enormous was happening and that it
was our destiny to be at the center of it. Hanging together, we
quickly discovered the many paths we'd taken to get where we were
at that moment and the circumstance of timing that had opened the
door for us.

   PRELUDE TO PART THREE: Hours after the Harlem riot, thousands of
blacks streamed into the streets of Rochester, N.Y., in frenzied
mobs. They were followed by a horde of reporters. Still in his
hotel room in Harlem, Earl Caldwell received a frantic phone call
from Dick Dougherty, the city editor at the Democrat and Chronicle,
who ordered him to return to Rochester to cover the breaking
events. Here, Caldwell describes the social unrest that gripped
Rochester after the street rioting ended, his chance to meet and
talk with Malcolm X, and one of the most important lessons he
learned about being a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened in Rochester before I was to say my last
good-bye. The riots had shifted the dynamic there. Blacks savored a
newfound power to force the white leadership to address
longstanding grievances. Whites were scared. Would future rioting
be confined to the ghetto, or would it spread downtown to white
areas of the city?
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties mounted when a coalition of religious groups brought
in Saul Alinsky, already a legend as a white organizer who taught
confrontational politics to ghetto activists. From this emerged
FIGHT, a militant direct-action group whose members were soon
marching into executive boardrooms demanding jobs and investments
in the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was getting a reputation. The ultimate confirmation of
that came when Malcolm X accepted an invitation to address a black
church there in February 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Malcolm was involved in a dispute with Elijah
Muhammad's black Muslim organization. Four days before his
scheduled appearance in Rochester, his home in Queens, N.Y., was
firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' Alex Haley told of how
Malcolm, ``barking commands and snatching up screaming frightened
children, got the family safely out of the back door into the
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm was sure that his enemies in Elijah Muhammad's group
were responsible for the attack. That feud seemed to be turning
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, there was speculation that the speech would be
canceled. But Malcolm arrived at Corn Hill Methodist Church on Feb.
16 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned when my editors assigned another reporter to cover
Malcolm's speech. They pulled me aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be trouble,'' I was told. ``We need you to handle
the street action.'' Although devastated, I accepted the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the speech, a huge crowd was at the church. A
source whispered to me that Malcolm X wanted to meet later with
some local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like you to be there,'' I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm delivered a powerful speech, which I watched from the
back of the church.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he stood up, he was saying, ``My reason for being
here is to discuss the black revolution that is going on, that's
taking place on this earth. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone jammed into the church hung on his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problems of the black man here in this country today
have ceased to be a problem of just the American Negro or an
American problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a professor, he delivered his analysis in lecture style.
Then, about halfway through, he zeroed in on his target of the
night: the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not against people because they're white. But we're
against those who practice racism. ... And because we're against
it, the press says we're violent. We're not for violence. We're for
peace. But the people that we're up against are for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice, at first professorial, began to rise. ``This is what
the racists have always done ... And then they use the press to
make (it) look like the victim is the criminal, and the criminal is
the victim. ... They take the press, and through the press they
beat the system ... They use the press to get public opinion on
their side. ... They take statistics, and through the press they
feed them to the public. They make it appear that the role of crime
in the black community is higher than it is anywhere else. ... And
the whites go along with it. Because they think that everybody over
there's a criminal anyway. This is what the press does.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of an hour, Malcolm X cited example after example
of how the press was used against black people. As he made his
case, many in the crowd stood and shouted their approval.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel relieved that I was not covering his speech. I
also realized that I could not go to his hotel later with the
others. He was so damning in his indictment that I was convinced
that the meeting would be a ``get the press'' session. As a
representative of the local paper, I did not feel that I should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I wanted to meet Malcolm, I did not go.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Feb. 21, a cold and snowy Sunday, I was at
work at the Democrat and Chronicle. Sundays were always slow and I
was standing in the wire room, watching the various stories come in
over the teletype machines.
</P>
<P>
   I was there when the teletype bell began to ring, alerting
editors that a very important story was about to move. And that
day, when the bell began to ring, I hovered over the machine and
watched in horror as the bulletin came in that Malcolm X had been
shot and killed just as he was starting to deliver a speech at the
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the lesson driven home was that a reporter's job
required toughness and that journalism was not the place for one
easily embarrassed or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake.

<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X was killed, two
reporters, Stan Scott and Gene Simpson, were right up front in the
Audubon Ballroom, so close to the podium that when the shooting
started, they had to dive to the floor for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Being there changed a lot for Scott and Simpson. But how they
came to be in the ballroom that afternoon played a large part in
ushering in a whole new era for black reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the epilogue to ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' the
writer Alex Haley explained that on the day he was killed, Malcolm
X had specifically ordered that no press be allowed inside the
Audubon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott and Simpson arrived for Malcolm's meeting, their
press credentials were in clear view. At the door, the men were
greeted by one of Malcolm's lieutenants. ``No press allowed,'' he
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the two stood pondering the ``no press'' edict.
Malcolm's aide pointed to their credentials and offered a
suggestion. ``Put 'em in your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They complied. ``As black citizens, you can go on in,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that afternoon Stan Scott and Gene Simpson got what
reporters dream of _ the experience of being there, of being
wherever it is at the precise moment that something truly important
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence in the Audobon Ballroom that day changed the two
reporters' professional lives, for the better. Scott, who was
working for United Press International, was lured away to join
WINS, New York City's leading all-news radio station. Simpson, a
reporter for WMCA radio, left to join CBS radio's all-news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than what happened to those news reporters
was the action taken by Malcolm X's supporters in the wake of his
murder. What the supporters did brought a swift, definable change
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's aides had concluded that their leader's ``no press''
order was proof that the time had come in which the black community
and black meetings should be off limits to white reporters. And
they also believed that if Malcolm had made an exception for black
reporters, so should they.
</P>
<P>
   So, grieving and wanting to honor their slain leader, they made
it their cause to keep white reporters out of meetings among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long after, as a reporter for the Herald Tribune, I
witnessed nothing more shocking than the tense confrontations that
ensued when white reporters showed up in Harlem and other black
communities to cover meetings and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did anybody ever bar them at the door. The reporters
would be allowed inside and even get seated. It was like baiting a
trap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting was about to begin, someone would shout,
``Wait, wait, wait,'' and, pointing toward the reporters who were
white, would ask: ``What are they doing in here?''
</P>
<P>
   And then the show was on. Voices got louder, people jumped to
their feet, and immediately they began shouting the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``White reporters out! White reporters out!''
</P>
<P>
   When the white reporters did not leave fast enough or dared to
argue a right to stay, they would be grabbed and roughly ushered
out the door. Those of us who were reporters and black discreetly
put our notebooks and pencils away, but we did not budge from our
seats and nobody ever tried to force us out.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, already embarrassed at being scooped by
UPI on the assassination of Malcolm X, responded by opening a news
bureau in the heart of Harlem. Gil Scott and Hollie West, both
blacks, were the two reporters assigned to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Scott, born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., began his career
in journalism in 1957 as a desk assistant at CBS. In 1959, he moved
to the Reporter-Dispatch in White Plains, N.Y., where he worked as
a sportswriter. His career was interrupted briefly when he was
recalled to active duty in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joined the Newark News, where he and John Dotson
were the only black reporters on staff. Gil Scott stayed there
until he was hired by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native, Hollie West, in 1963, became the first black
reporter on a daily newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area. That
paper was the Oakland Tribune. From Oakland, West went to New York
to work at the AP not long after Malcolm X was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the AP's Harlem bureau was up and running, the
summer of 1965 was fast approaching. Many news organizations
pondered the same question: ``What are blacks going to do?'' Little
did they know that black culture was about to take center stage.

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART ONE: In August 1963, tensions between blacks and
whites in many cities across the United States were on the rise.
Crowds converged on the nation's capital for the historic March on
Washington. Earl Caldwell, then a reporter for the Lancaster
Intelligencer-Journal, joined his parents in the living room of
their home in central Pennsylvania to watch Martin Luther King Jr.
deliver what many call his finest speech. Ten days later, a bomb
exploded during Sunday services at a black church in Birmingham,
Ala., killing four girls. Across urban America, black populations
became restless, and newspaper editors began searching for
reporters who could get inside the ``ghettos'' to gather stories
from black communities. The Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester,
N.Y., began to recruit Caldwell aggressively. In the fall of 1963,
he accepted the job. Here, Caldwell recounts his first assignment
for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The story was boxed across the top of the front page of the
Sunday edition. It was even above the masthead. Of all the stories
I had ever written, nothing came close to this, my first story as a
reporter at the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the story herald my arrival, but there was also a
photograph of me, which was a way of letting readers know that for
the first time the newspaper had a reporter who was black.
</P>
<P>
   I'd arrived in town expecting the newspaper to make good on a
promise. Back when they were wooing me, I was told that if I
accepted the job, they would have an apartment waiting in a luxury
building not far from the newspaper. When I got to town and
mentioned all of this, I got a blank stare. Nobody knew what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dick Dougherty came up with his idea. He was the city
editor, and on my first day at the D&AMP;C, he told me that of all the
complaints that he was getting from blacks, housing was the
biggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the housing here is really segregated,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that's true or not. You have to find an apartment. We
don't need to phony up anything. We can use your experience to tell
a true story of what the situation really is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you do it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty was a tall, thin guy whose hair was white even though
he didn't look to be a day past 35. His style was low key but very
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I had never reported and written a story about race, and what
Dougherty was suggesting caught me off-guard. But I was just
starting out on a new job; there was no way I was going to say no
to my city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty wanted two reporters on the story _ one white and one
black. The plan was for each of us to try separately to rent the
same apartment. The white reporter was Bill Vogler. He was a
veteran on the staff at the D&AMP;C and he liked the idea. The two of
us got newspapers and circled apartments in my price range. Then we
got started.
</P>
<P>
   After we had visited about five or six apartments, Vogler asked
me, ``Are you sure you're actually going into these places?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not understand. I would just reach the door and promptly
be told, ``The apartment has already been rented.'' Right after I
was told that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the
same place and be invited inside. He'd get a whole spiel on how
great the apartment was, why he'd like it and what the neighborhood
had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   My experience was so different that at times it would be
downright embarrassing. One building had a big sign on the lawn,
Apartment for Rent. I was heading up the sidewalk when a window on
the second floor opened. A woman leaned out and hollered: ``If
you're coming for the apartment, forget it. It's already rented.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I explained all this to Vogler, we kept going. We visited
apartment after apartment. It was always the same: no to me, yes to
him. I just kept making notes of everything that happened. At the
typewriter, I got my chance to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story was published, blacks began showing up
in the newsroom ``to meet Earl Caldwell.'' Some would barge right
past the receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   These were not ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Some people called these visitors troublemakers. They called
themselves activists, which meant they were in the forefront of
stoking, shaping and channeling the anger they said was growing in
Rochester's two black communities, the Third and Seventh wards.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper itself was a target of their anger. They said they
never saw reporters in their neighborhoods ``except when there's
trouble'' and accused the newspaper of not covering the important
issues in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   They looked to me to change that. They said that they expected
to see me in their communities, to tell the stories that were not
being told. The irony was that in a sense, my editor and the
activists were saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out what the facts are,'' Dougherty had
challenged me. ``We expect you to tell the story,'' the activists
said, inviting me to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   I was being handed what every reporter wants: a big and
important story.
</P>
<P>
   The front-page story of my experience in hunting an apartment
had given me the kind of notoriety that a reporter new in town
could only dream of. The reaction was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Once the story was published, so many whites called to offer an
apartment that I had to write another piece just to tell that
story. One very nice woman, also white, did rent me a place not far
from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had settled in, black folks still hung a nickname
on me. They called me boll weevil. The name came from the title of
a popular song, and when they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, ``Here comes boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home.'''

</P>
<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART TWO: On a hot night in Harlem in July 1964, the
explosion came. After a white police officer had shot and killed a
black youth, riots erupted in the black neighborhoods in the
northeast _ a portent of what was to come. At the Democrat and
Chronicle, the city editor called Earl Caldwell to his desk. ``We
want you to go down to Harlem,'' he said. Although Caldwell had
visited New York, he had never been to Harlem. He grabbed a
notebook and a few clothes and headed for the airport, hoping that
his experience in Rochester had prepared him for the challenge in
New York City. Here, Caldwell describes what it was like for him
and other black reporters in Harlem during the riots, which raged
around them for three nights.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The rioting in Harlem came in furious bursts. Rocks and bottles
sailed from tenement roofs. Molotov cocktails exploded on streets
littered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Cops fired salvo after salvo into smoky, pitch-black skies.
Police cruisers, sirens wailing, roared in pursuit of hit-and-run
looters.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds lined the streets, sometimes as many as a thousand
people, all of them black. They screamed, jeered, ducked, dodged
and _ when turned on by riot-weary cops _ scrambled and ran.
</P>
<P>
   And there we were, smack in the middle of it, with notebooks in
hand, dashing at the heels of the crowds, observing the battles and
trying as best we could to record it all.
</P>
<P>
   Frenzied as it was in those moments of battle, that's all they
were, moments. They would rise like a storm and then, just as
suddenly, dissipate. And with every inevitable lull in the action,
attention turned to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' people demanded. Some would reach for the press
credentials that dangled from our necks.
</P>
<P>
   We tried to explain ourselves. ``We're press,'' we said. But
that was not nearly explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What press?'' our inquisitors fired back.
</P>
<P>
   In that back-and-forth, something that even we had not realized
came into focus. Harlem cops and black residents had seen black
reporters before. But almost without exception those reporters
worked for black newspapers, mainly weeklies. This time we
represented mainstream white-owned daily newspapers and radio
stations, a major first.
</P>
<P>
   A small colony of reporters who were black had arrived in the
big leagues of New York City journalism. And this took everyone by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Having come from Rochester, I was as astonished as the police
and the blacks on the streets to see at least a dozen or so
reporters, all black like me, representing large and powerful
organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated Press, the
New York Post, the Daily News, United Press International, Newsday,
and Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In that week, I came to know reporters such as Gerald Fraser,
Austin Scott, Ted Poston, Tom Johnson, Les Carson, Claude Lewis,
Ted Jones, Junius Griffin, Wally Terry, Paul Hathaway, Gene Simpson
and Stan Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And on the streets of Harlem, between bursts of rioting, we
acknowledged with one another that we were a part of a bit of
history.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that we were there. What was developing into one
of the biggest stories in America was largely in our hands. The
events unfolding on the streets of Harlem would make news all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been little more than a mere footnote but it was
still a piece of history in the making. Never had the major media
put so much of an important story in the hands of reporters who
were not white.
</P>
<P>
   Every chance they got, the cops would stare us down. It was as
though they could not accept that we were qualified and that our
reporting would be central to what people everywhere would read of
the Harlem riots.
</P>
<P>
   Some white reporters sought us out. They would shake our hands
and stay as close to us as possible. That put them closer to the
story. It also made them feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a white New York Times photographer was jumped by a mob
and beaten so badly that the bones around his eyes were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had two black reporters on the story, Junius Griffin
and Ted Jones, who set up a temporary bureau in the Theresa Hotel
at 125th Street and 7th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was a former Marine. He broke in as a journalist on
Stars and Stripes, the United States military newspaper. In Harlem,
he emerged a hero. He saw a group of blacks surround and threaten
three white reporters from the Journal-American, a Hearst
newspaper. He charged into the crowd, grabbed the reporters, and
walked them out unharmed. He knew that only a black reporter could
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jones made news too. He watched some cops chasing black
youths who had been throwing rocks and bottles. As the kids outran
the cops and got away, some in the crowd cheered derisively. In
frustration, the cops began to use their nightsticks at random.
Impulsively, Ted interceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people didn't do anything,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   When the cops ignored him and continued swinging their batons
wildly, he pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to beat these people,'' he insisted. ``You
cannot do that. You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' a cop barked, irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Ted grabbed his press card and held it out. ``The New York
Times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here,'' the cop ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and heavyset, Ted refused to budge. As the cops continued
their attack, he was knocked to the ground. He wasn't injured, only
shook up, but what happened to him became a part of the news story.
</P>
<P>
   The riots raged through three nights, and at the end of each
day, long after the crowds and the cops had drifted away, the
reporters would still be on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   We could sense that something enormous was happening and that it
was our destiny to be at the center of it. Hanging together, we
quickly discovered the many paths we'd taken to get where we were
at that moment and the circumstance of timing that had opened the
door for us.

   PRELUDE TO PART THREE: Hours after the Harlem riot, thousands of
blacks streamed into the streets of Rochester, N.Y., in frenzied
mobs. They were followed by a horde of reporters. Still in his
hotel room in Harlem, Earl Caldwell received a frantic phone call
from Dick Dougherty, the city editor at the Democrat and Chronicle,
who ordered him to return to Rochester to cover the breaking
events. Here, Caldwell describes the social unrest that gripped
Rochester after the street rioting ended, his chance to meet and
talk with Malcolm X, and one of the most important lessons he
learned about being a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened in Rochester before I was to say my last
good-bye. The riots had shifted the dynamic there. Blacks savored a
newfound power to force the white leadership to address
longstanding grievances. Whites were scared. Would future rioting
be confined to the ghetto, or would it spread downtown to white
areas of the city?
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties mounted when a coalition of religious groups brought
in Saul Alinsky, already a legend as a white organizer who taught
confrontational politics to ghetto activists. From this emerged
FIGHT, a militant direct-action group whose members were soon
marching into executive boardrooms demanding jobs and investments
in the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was getting a reputation. The ultimate confirmation of
that came when Malcolm X accepted an invitation to address a black
church there in February 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Malcolm was involved in a dispute with Elijah
Muhammad's black Muslim organization. Four days before his
scheduled appearance in Rochester, his home in Queens, N.Y., was
firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' Alex Haley told of how
Malcolm, ``barking commands and snatching up screaming frightened
children, got the family safely out of the back door into the
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm was sure that his enemies in Elijah Muhammad's group
were responsible for the attack. That feud seemed to be turning
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, there was speculation that the speech would be
canceled. But Malcolm arrived at Corn Hill Methodist Church on Feb.
16 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned when my editors assigned another reporter to cover
Malcolm's speech. They pulled me aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be trouble,'' I was told. ``We need you to handle
the street action.'' Although devastated, I accepted the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the speech, a huge crowd was at the church. A
source whispered to me that Malcolm X wanted to meet later with
some local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like you to be there,'' I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm delivered a powerful speech, which I watched from the
back of the church.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he stood up, he was saying, ``My reason for being
here is to discuss the black revolution that is going on, that's
taking place on this earth. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone jammed into the church hung on his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problems of the black man here in this country today
have ceased to be a problem of just the American Negro or an
American problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a professor, he delivered his analysis in lecture style.
Then, about halfway through, he zeroed in on his target of the
night: the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not against people because they're white. But we're
against those who practice racism. ... And because we're against
it, the press says we're violent. We're not for violence. We're for
peace. But the people that we're up against are for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice, at first professorial, began to rise. ``This is what
the racists have always done ... And then they use the press to
make (it) look like the victim is the criminal, and the criminal is
the victim. ... They take the press, and through the press they
beat the system ... They use the press to get public opinion on
their side. ... They take statistics, and through the press they
feed them to the public. They make it appear that the role of crime
in the black community is higher than it is anywhere else. ... And
the whites go along with it. Because they think that everybody over
there's a criminal anyway. This is what the press does.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of an hour, Malcolm X cited example after example
of how the press was used against black people. As he made his
case, many in the crowd stood and shouted their approval.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel relieved that I was not covering his speech. I
also realized that I could not go to his hotel later with the
others. He was so damning in his indictment that I was convinced
that the meeting would be a ``get the press'' session. As a
representative of the local paper, I did not feel that I should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I wanted to meet Malcolm, I did not go.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Feb. 21, a cold and snowy Sunday, I was at
work at the Democrat and Chronicle. Sundays were always slow and I
was standing in the wire room, watching the various stories come in
over the teletype machines.
</P>
<P>
   I was there when the teletype bell began to ring, alerting
editors that a very important story was about to move. And that
day, when the bell began to ring, I hovered over the machine and
watched in horror as the bulletin came in that Malcolm X had been
shot and killed just as he was starting to deliver a speech at the
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the lesson driven home was that a reporter's job
required toughness and that journalism was not the place for one
easily embarrassed or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake.

</P>
<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X was killed, two
reporters, Stan Scott and Gene Simpson, were right up front in the
Audubon Ballroom, so close to the podium that when the shooting
started, they had to dive to the floor for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Being there changed a lot for Scott and Simpson. But how they
came to be in the ballroom that afternoon played a large part in
ushering in a whole new era for black reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the epilogue to ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' the
writer Alex Haley explained that on the day he was killed, Malcolm
X had specifically ordered that no press be allowed inside the
Audubon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott and Simpson arrived for Malcolm's meeting, their
press credentials were in clear view. At the door, the men were
greeted by one of Malcolm's lieutenants. ``No press allowed,'' he
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the two stood pondering the ``no press'' edict.
Malcolm's aide pointed to their credentials and offered a
suggestion. ``Put 'em in your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They complied. ``As black citizens, you can go on in,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that afternoon Stan Scott and Gene Simpson got what
reporters dream of _ the experience of being there, of being
wherever it is at the precise moment that something truly important
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence in the Audobon Ballroom that day changed the two
reporters' professional lives, for the better. Scott, who was
working for United Press International, was lured away to join
WINS, New York City's leading all-news radio station. Simpson, a
reporter for WMCA radio, left to join CBS radio's all-news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than what happened to those news reporters
was the action taken by Malcolm X's supporters in the wake of his
murder. What the supporters did brought a swift, definable change
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's aides had concluded that their leader's ``no press''
order was proof that the time had come in which the black community
and black meetings should be off limits to white reporters. And
they also believed that if Malcolm had made an exception for black
reporters, so should they.
</P>
<P>
   So, grieving and wanting to honor their slain leader, they made
it their cause to keep white reporters out of meetings among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long after, as a reporter for the Herald Tribune, I
witnessed nothing more shocking than the tense confrontations that
ensued when white reporters showed up in Harlem and other black
communities to cover meetings and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did anybody ever bar them at the door. The reporters
would be allowed inside and even get seated. It was like baiting a
trap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting was about to begin, someone would shout,
``Wait, wait, wait,'' and, pointing toward the reporters who were
white, would ask: ``What are they doing in here?''
</P>
<P>
   And then the show was on. Voices got louder, people jumped to
their feet, and immediately they began shouting the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``White reporters out! White reporters out!''
</P>
<P>
   When the white reporters did not leave fast enough or dared to
argue a right to stay, they would be grabbed and roughly ushered
out the door. Those of us who were reporters and black discreetly
put our notebooks and pencils away, but we did not budge from our
seats and nobody ever tried to force us out.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, already embarrassed at being scooped by
UPI on the assassination of Malcolm X, responded by opening a news
bureau in the heart of Harlem. Gil Scott and Hollie West, both
blacks, were the two reporters assigned to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Scott, born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., began his career
in journalism in 1957 as a desk assistant at CBS. In 1959, he moved
to the Reporter-Dispatch in White Plains, N.Y., where he worked as
a sportswriter. His career was interrupted briefly when he was
recalled to active duty in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joined the Newark News, where he and John Dotson
were the only black reporters on staff. Gil Scott stayed there
until he was hired by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native, Hollie West, in 1963, became the first black
reporter on a daily newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area. That
paper was the Oakland Tribune. From Oakland, West went to New York
to work at the AP not long after Malcolm X was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the AP's Harlem bureau was up and running, the
summer of 1965 was fast approaching. Many news organizations
pondered the same question: ``What are blacks going to do?'' Little
did they know that black culture was about to take center stage.

</P>
<P>
   Mylus Martin hastened the call that brought me to New York City
and the Herald Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966 and editors at the paper were in a
quandary. Claude Lewis, who had been recruited from Newsweek, had
left the Herald Tribune for a job at the Philadelphia Bulletin.
Lewis had been the reporter the Trib counted on to cover the
exploding story of race. Now, the editors wanted a reporter to
literally camp out in Harlem and other ``Negro'' areas of New York
to report and write about what was taking place. A white reporter
could not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the only reporter on the Trib, and he flat out
refused to cover the race story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I do,'' he argued. He said that he was trained
in music and that his skill was covering the arts. That was the
coverage he had come to the Trib to write, Martin said. ``Send
somebody else up to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's steadfastness brought the call that I had been waiting
for in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a problem covering that story?'' asked David
Laventhol, city editor of the Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. The story that Mylus Martin did not want became
the one that I could not get enough of. It was more than just a big
story. A massive redefinition of self was taking place in the
ghettos. Very little went unchallenged, and at the core was an
unprecedented embracing of blackness.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases ``Black is beautiful'' and ``I'm black and I'm
proud'' were said again and again on the streets. It was black
Africa, black America, black studies, black teachers, black
lawyers, black cops and black children. A whole world was exploding
around blackness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revolution. As reporters, we were on the inside,
watching it all and telling of it as it happened.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just about skin color. This fact hit me with a bang
when, while covering my Harlem beat, I met two brothers, Elombe and
Kwame Brath.
</P>
<P>
   The Braths had been putting on the ``Naturally'' shows for years
_ shows that focused on black hair styles and fashions _ without
many people noticing. Still they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   But this was 1966 and times were changing. ``Naturally 1966''
caused a sensation. The shows featured women who were called ``the
Grandassa models'' (named after ``Grassaland,'' the name that
African nationalist leader Carlos Cooks applied to Africa).
</P>
<P>
   The models had very dark complexions. And instead of
straightening their hair with hot combs, they wore ``naturals,''
later called ``Afros,'' which meant hair groomed and worn
naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandassa models were stunning. They were so dark that their
faces had a bluish shimmer. People described them as
``blue-black.'' You saw them and your mouth just fell open.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were ready,'' Elombe Brath recalled. ``The time was
right.'' And it was. A lot of women took to the ``natural'' look.
And nobody was neutral: You either liked it or you didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For us reporters, the ``race story'' was not simply about
covering riots. It was far more compelling than that, far more
socially significant. We realized we were at the eye of a profound
social shift.
</P>
<P>
   Our growing colony in New York City changed too, and in a
significant way. We were not all male anymore. Ruth Ross broke
through at Newsweek magazine. She started as a researcher in 1964.
In 1966, with the race story as important as any other, she became
the first woman to join our contingent as a reporter on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   And there was something else: A lot of black reporters also put
away the hot combs, the Dixie Peach, the Murray's hair dressings
and the stocking caps and showed up for work sporting ``Afro'' hair
styles.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a few newsrooms, all hell broke loose. At a TV
station where she was a reporter, Melba Tolliver was told that she
could not go on the air unless she first put on a scarf or
something to cover her Afro. She refused, but the station did not
back down until a black protest was mounted.
</P>
<P>
   At some other news outlets, editors ordered black reporters to
get hair cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible for me to separate myself entirely from the
movement that I had been thrust into. The ``roots'' that were being
examined were my roots too. And the activists pushing for this
change were young, many of them about my age. I gravitated to their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It rang true for me when they derisively attacked the word
``Negro'' (``knee-grow'') as something from cotton patches and
plantations. I was ready to shake ``Negro'' off too. The word
``black'' made sense. It linked black America to black Africa. I
wanted to be called black.
</P>
<P>
   I got rid of my hair grease and stocking caps. I let my hair
grow natural. The Afro I cultivated was modest, but that was the
way I wanted it. I could connect with the movement on the streets
and as a reporter, and still be considered promising by my white
editors at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they understood.

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART ONE: In August 1963, tensions between blacks and
whites in many cities across the United States were on the rise.
Crowds converged on the nation's capital for the historic March on
Washington. Earl Caldwell, then a reporter for the Lancaster
Intelligencer-Journal, joined his parents in the living room of
their home in central Pennsylvania to watch Martin Luther King Jr.
deliver what many call his finest speech. Ten days later, a bomb
exploded during Sunday services at a black church in Birmingham,
Ala., killing four girls. Across urban America, black populations
became restless, and newspaper editors began searching for
reporters who could get inside the ``ghettos'' to gather stories
from black communities. The Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester,
N.Y., began to recruit Caldwell aggressively. In the fall of 1963,
he accepted the job. Here, Caldwell recounts his first assignment
for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The story was boxed across the top of the front page of the
Sunday edition. It was even above the masthead. Of all the stories
I had ever written, nothing came close to this, my first story as a
reporter at the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the story herald my arrival, but there was also a
photograph of me, which was a way of letting readers know that for
the first time the newspaper had a reporter who was black.
</P>
<P>
   I'd arrived in town expecting the newspaper to make good on a
promise. Back when they were wooing me, I was told that if I
accepted the job, they would have an apartment waiting in a luxury
building not far from the newspaper. When I got to town and
mentioned all of this, I got a blank stare. Nobody knew what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dick Dougherty came up with his idea. He was the city
editor, and on my first day at the D&AMP;C, he told me that of all the
complaints that he was getting from blacks, housing was the
biggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the housing here is really segregated,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that's true or not. You have to find an apartment. We
don't need to phony up anything. We can use your experience to tell
a true story of what the situation really is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you do it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty was a tall, thin guy whose hair was white even though
he didn't look to be a day past 35. His style was low key but very
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I had never reported and written a story about race, and what
Dougherty was suggesting caught me off-guard. But I was just
starting out on a new job; there was no way I was going to say no
to my city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty wanted two reporters on the story _ one white and one
black. The plan was for each of us to try separately to rent the
same apartment. The white reporter was Bill Vogler. He was a
veteran on the staff at the D&AMP;C and he liked the idea. The two of
us got newspapers and circled apartments in my price range. Then we
got started.
</P>
<P>
   After we had visited about five or six apartments, Vogler asked
me, ``Are you sure you're actually going into these places?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not understand. I would just reach the door and promptly
be told, ``The apartment has already been rented.'' Right after I
was told that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the
same place and be invited inside. He'd get a whole spiel on how
great the apartment was, why he'd like it and what the neighborhood
had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   My experience was so different that at times it would be
downright embarrassing. One building had a big sign on the lawn,
Apartment for Rent. I was heading up the sidewalk when a window on
the second floor opened. A woman leaned out and hollered: ``If
you're coming for the apartment, forget it. It's already rented.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I explained all this to Vogler, we kept going. We visited
apartment after apartment. It was always the same: no to me, yes to
him. I just kept making notes of everything that happened. At the
typewriter, I got my chance to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story was published, blacks began showing up
in the newsroom ``to meet Earl Caldwell.'' Some would barge right
past the receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   These were not ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Some people called these visitors troublemakers. They called
themselves activists, which meant they were in the forefront of
stoking, shaping and channeling the anger they said was growing in
Rochester's two black communities, the Third and Seventh wards.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper itself was a target of their anger. They said they
never saw reporters in their neighborhoods ``except when there's
trouble'' and accused the newspaper of not covering the important
issues in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   They looked to me to change that. They said that they expected
to see me in their communities, to tell the stories that were not
being told. The irony was that in a sense, my editor and the
activists were saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out what the facts are,'' Dougherty had
challenged me. ``We expect you to tell the story,'' the activists
said, inviting me to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   I was being handed what every reporter wants: a big and
important story.
</P>
<P>
   The front-page story of my experience in hunting an apartment
had given me the kind of notoriety that a reporter new in town
could only dream of. The reaction was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Once the story was published, so many whites called to offer an
apartment that I had to write another piece just to tell that
story. One very nice woman, also white, did rent me a place not far
from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had settled in, black folks still hung a nickname
on me. They called me boll weevil. The name came from the title of
a popular song, and when they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, ``Here comes boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home.'''

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART TWO: On a hot night in Harlem in July 1964, the
explosion came. After a white police officer had shot and killed a
black youth, riots erupted in the black neighborhoods in the
northeast _ a portent of what was to come. At the Democrat and
Chronicle, the city editor called Earl Caldwell to his desk. ``We
want you to go down to Harlem,'' he said. Although Caldwell had
visited New York, he had never been to Harlem. He grabbed a
notebook and a few clothes and headed for the airport, hoping that
his experience in Rochester had prepared him for the challenge in
New York City. Here, Caldwell describes what it was like for him
and other black reporters in Harlem during the riots, which raged
around them for three nights.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The rioting in Harlem came in furious bursts. Rocks and bottles
sailed from tenement roofs. Molotov cocktails exploded on streets
littered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Cops fired salvo after salvo into smoky, pitch-black skies.
Police cruisers, sirens wailing, roared in pursuit of hit-and-run
looters.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds lined the streets, sometimes as many as a thousand
people, all of them black. They screamed, jeered, ducked, dodged
and _ when turned on by riot-weary cops _ scrambled and ran.
</P>
<P>
   And there we were, smack in the middle of it, with notebooks in
hand, dashing at the heels of the crowds, observing the battles and
trying as best we could to record it all.
</P>
<P>
   Frenzied as it was in those moments of battle, that's all they
were, moments. They would rise like a storm and then, just as
suddenly, dissipate. And with every inevitable lull in the action,
attention turned to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' people demanded. Some would reach for the press
credentials that dangled from our necks.
</P>
<P>
   We tried to explain ourselves. ``We're press,'' we said. But
that was not nearly explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What press?'' our inquisitors fired back.
</P>
<P>
   In that back-and-forth, something that even we had not realized
came into focus. Harlem cops and black residents had seen black
reporters before. But almost without exception those reporters
worked for black newspapers, mainly weeklies. This time we
represented mainstream white-owned daily newspapers and radio
stations, a major first.
</P>
<P>
   A small colony of reporters who were black had arrived in the
big leagues of New York City journalism. And this took everyone by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Having come from Rochester, I was as astonished as the police
and the blacks on the streets to see at least a dozen or so
reporters, all black like me, representing large and powerful
organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated Press, the
New York Post, the Daily News, United Press International, Newsday,
and Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In that week, I came to know reporters such as Gerald Fraser,
Austin Scott, Ted Poston, Tom Johnson, Les Carson, Claude Lewis,
Ted Jones, Junius Griffin, Wally Terry, Paul Hathaway, Gene Simpson
and Stan Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And on the streets of Harlem, between bursts of rioting, we
acknowledged with one another that we were a part of a bit of
history.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that we were there. What was developing into one
of the biggest stories in America was largely in our hands. The
events unfolding on the streets of Harlem would make news all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been little more than a mere footnote but it was
still a piece of history in the making. Never had the major media
put so much of an important story in the hands of reporters who
were not white.
</P>
<P>
   Every chance they got, the cops would stare us down. It was as
though they could not accept that we were qualified and that our
reporting would be central to what people everywhere would read of
the Harlem riots.
</P>
<P>
   Some white reporters sought us out. They would shake our hands
and stay as close to us as possible. That put them closer to the
story. It also made them feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a white New York Times photographer was jumped by a mob
and beaten so badly that the bones around his eyes were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had two black reporters on the story, Junius Griffin
and Ted Jones, who set up a temporary bureau in the Theresa Hotel
at 125th Street and 7th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was a former Marine. He broke in as a journalist on
Stars and Stripes, the United States military newspaper. In Harlem,
he emerged a hero. He saw a group of blacks surround and threaten
three white reporters from the Journal-American, a Hearst
newspaper. He charged into the crowd, grabbed the reporters, and
walked them out unharmed. He knew that only a black reporter could
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jones made news too. He watched some cops chasing black
youths who had been throwing rocks and bottles. As the kids outran
the cops and got away, some in the crowd cheered derisively. In
frustration, the cops began to use their nightsticks at random.
Impulsively, Ted interceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people didn't do anything,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   When the cops ignored him and continued swinging their batons
wildly, he pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to beat these people,'' he insisted. ``You
cannot do that. You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' a cop barked, irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Ted grabbed his press card and held it out. ``The New York
Times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here,'' the cop ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and heavyset, Ted refused to budge. As the cops continued
their attack, he was knocked to the ground. He wasn't injured, only
shook up, but what happened to him became a part of the news story.
</P>
<P>
   The riots raged through three nights, and at the end of each
day, long after the crowds and the cops had drifted away, the
reporters would still be on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   We could sense that something enormous was happening and that it
was our destiny to be at the center of it. Hanging together, we
quickly discovered the many paths we'd taken to get where we were
at that moment and the circumstance of timing that had opened the
door for us.

   PRELUDE TO PART THREE: Hours after the Harlem riot, thousands of
blacks streamed into the streets of Rochester, N.Y., in frenzied
mobs. They were followed by a horde of reporters. Still in his
hotel room in Harlem, Earl Caldwell received a frantic phone call
from Dick Dougherty, the city editor at the Democrat and Chronicle,
who ordered him to return to Rochester to cover the breaking
events. Here, Caldwell describes the social unrest that gripped
Rochester after the street rioting ended, his chance to meet and
talk with Malcolm X, and one of the most important lessons he
learned about being a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened in Rochester before I was to say my last
good-bye. The riots had shifted the dynamic there. Blacks savored a
newfound power to force the white leadership to address
longstanding grievances. Whites were scared. Would future rioting
be confined to the ghetto, or would it spread downtown to white
areas of the city?
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties mounted when a coalition of religious groups brought
in Saul Alinsky, already a legend as a white organizer who taught
confrontational politics to ghetto activists. From this emerged
FIGHT, a militant direct-action group whose members were soon
marching into executive boardrooms demanding jobs and investments
in the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was getting a reputation. The ultimate confirmation of
that came when Malcolm X accepted an invitation to address a black
church there in February 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Malcolm was involved in a dispute with Elijah
Muhammad's black Muslim organization. Four days before his
scheduled appearance in Rochester, his home in Queens, N.Y., was
firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' Alex Haley told of how
Malcolm, ``barking commands and snatching up screaming frightened
children, got the family safely out of the back door into the
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm was sure that his enemies in Elijah Muhammad's group
were responsible for the attack. That feud seemed to be turning
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, there was speculation that the speech would be
canceled. But Malcolm arrived at Corn Hill Methodist Church on Feb.
16 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned when my editors assigned another reporter to cover
Malcolm's speech. They pulled me aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be trouble,'' I was told. ``We need you to handle
the street action.'' Although devastated, I accepted the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the speech, a huge crowd was at the church. A
source whispered to me that Malcolm X wanted to meet later with
some local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like you to be there,'' I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm delivered a powerful speech, which I watched from the
back of the church.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he stood up, he was saying, ``My reason for being
here is to discuss the black revolution that is going on, that's
taking place on this earth. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone jammed into the church hung on his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problems of the black man here in this country today
have ceased to be a problem of just the American Negro or an
American problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a professor, he delivered his analysis in lecture style.
Then, about halfway through, he zeroed in on his target of the
night: the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not against people because they're white. But we're
against those who practice racism. ... And because we're against
it, the press says we're violent. We're not for violence. We're for
peace. But the people that we're up against are for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice, at first professorial, began to rise. ``This is what
the racists have always done ... And then they use the press to
make (it) look like the victim is the criminal, and the criminal is
the victim. ... They take the press, and through the press they
beat the system ... They use the press to get public opinion on
their side. ... They take statistics, and through the press they
feed them to the public. They make it appear that the role of crime
in the black community is higher than it is anywhere else. ... And
the whites go along with it. Because they think that everybody over
there's a criminal anyway. This is what the press does.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of an hour, Malcolm X cited example after example
of how the press was used against black people. As he made his
case, many in the crowd stood and shouted their approval.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel relieved that I was not covering his speech. I
also realized that I could not go to his hotel later with the
others. He was so damning in his indictment that I was convinced
that the meeting would be a ``get the press'' session. As a
representative of the local paper, I did not feel that I should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I wanted to meet Malcolm, I did not go.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Feb. 21, a cold and snowy Sunday, I was at
work at the Democrat and Chronicle. Sundays were always slow and I
was standing in the wire room, watching the various stories come in
over the teletype machines.
</P>
<P>
   I was there when the teletype bell began to ring, alerting
editors that a very important story was about to move. And that
day, when the bell began to ring, I hovered over the machine and
watched in horror as the bulletin came in that Malcolm X had been
shot and killed just as he was starting to deliver a speech at the
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the lesson driven home was that a reporter's job
required toughness and that journalism was not the place for one
easily embarrassed or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake.

writer Alex Haley explained that on the day he was killed, Malcolm
X had specifically ordered that no press be allowed inside the
Audubon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott and Simpson arrived for Malcolm's meeting, their
press credentials were in clear view. At the door, the men were
greeted by one of Malcolm's lieutenants. ``No press allowed,'' he
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the two stood pondering the ``no press'' edict.
Malcolm's aide pointed to their credentials and offered a
suggestion. ``Put 'em in your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They complied. ``As black citizens, you can go on in,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that afternoon Stan Scott and Gene Simpson got what
reporters dream of _ the experience of being there, of being
wherever it is at the precise moment that something truly important
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence in the Audobon Ballroom that day changed the two
reporters' professional lives, for the better. Scott, who was
working for United Press International, was lured away to join
WINS, New York City's leading all-news radio station. Simpson, a
reporter for WMCA radio, left to join CBS radio's all-news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than what happened to those news reporters
was the action taken by Malcolm X's supporters in the wake of his
murder. What the supporters did brought a swift, definable change
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's aides had concluded that their leader's ``no press''
order was proof that the time had come in which the black community
and black meetings should be off limits to white reporters. And
they also believed that if Malcolm had made an exception for black
reporters, so should they.
</P>
<P>
   So, grieving and wanting to honor their slain leader, they made
it their cause to keep white reporters out of meetings among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long after, as a reporter for the Herald Tribune, I
witnessed nothing more shocking than the tense confrontations that
ensued when white reporters showed up in Harlem and other black
communities to cover meetings and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did anybody ever bar them at the door. The reporters
would be allowed inside and even get seated. It was like baiting a
trap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting was about to begin, someone would shout,
``Wait, wait, wait,'' and, pointing toward the reporters who were
white, would ask: ``What are they doing in here?''
</P>
<P>
   And then the show was on. Voices got louder, people jumped to
their feet, and immediately they began shouting the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``White reporters out! White reporters out!''
</P>
<P>
   When the white reporters did not leave fast enough or dared to
argue a right to stay, they would be grabbed and roughly ushered
out the door. Those of us who were reporters and black discreetly
put our notebooks and pencils away, but we did not budge from our
seats and nobody ever tried to force us out.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, already embarrassed at being scooped by
UPI on the assassination of Malcolm X, responded by opening a news
bureau in the heart of Harlem. Gil Scott and Hollie West, both
blacks, were the two reporters assigned to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Scott, born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., began his career
in journalism in 1957 as a desk assistant at CBS. In 1959, he moved
to the Reporter-Dispatch in White Plains, N.Y., where he worked as
a sportswriter. His career was interrupted briefly when he was
recalled to active duty in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joined the Newark News, where he and John Dotson
were the only black reporters on staff. Gil Scott stayed there
until he was hired by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native, Hollie West, in 1963, became the first black
reporter on a daily newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area. That
paper was the Oakland Tribune. From Oakland, West went to New York
to work at the AP not long after Malcolm X was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the AP's Harlem bureau was up and running, the
summer of 1965 was fast approaching. Many news organizations
pondered the same question: ``What are blacks going to do?'' Little
did they know that black culture was about to take center stage.

   (ATTENTION EDITORS: For Black History month, which begins on
Monday, Feb. 1, The New York times Syndicate is offering a
five-part feature, ``The Caldwell Journals,'' an account of major
moments in the civil rights movement of the 1960s by Earl Caldwell,
the nationally acclaimed black journalist whose early career was
shaped by that dynamic era. Caldwell, a former New York Times
reporter, was witness to some of the most important events of the
last 40 years. He covered the riots that swept many American cities
during the summer of 1967. In 1995, the National Association of
Black Journalists presented Caldwell with its President's Award,
saying his record of professional achievement made him ``one of the
most important journalists in the last 50 years.'' Caldwell is
currently a writer-in-residence at the Robert C. Maynard Institute
for Journalism Education in Oakland, Calif., and is writing ``The
Caldwell Journals'' for the institute's Web site. FOR PURCHASE
INFORMATION _ on an individual part or the entire package _ contact

<P>
   Mylus Martin hastened the call that brought me to New York City
and the Herald Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966 and editors at the paper were in a
quandary. Claude Lewis, who had been recruited from Newsweek, had
left the Herald Tribune for a job at the Philadelphia Bulletin.
Lewis had been the reporter the Trib counted on to cover the
exploding story of race. Now, the editors wanted a reporter to
literally camp out in Harlem and other ``Negro'' areas of New York
to report and write about what was taking place. A white reporter
could not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the only reporter on the Trib, and he flat out
refused to cover the race story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I do,'' he argued. He said that he was trained
in music and that his skill was covering the arts. That was the
coverage he had come to the Trib to write, Martin said. ``Send
somebody else up to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's steadfastness brought the call that I had been waiting
for in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a problem covering that story?'' asked David
Laventhol, city editor of the Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. The story that Mylus Martin did not want became
the one that I could not get enough of. It was more than just a big
story. A massive redefinition of self was taking place in the
ghettos. Very little went unchallenged, and at the core was an
unprecedented embracing of blackness.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases ``Black is beautiful'' and ``I'm black and I'm
proud'' were said again and again on the streets. It was black
Africa, black America, black studies, black teachers, black
lawyers, black cops and black children. A whole world was exploding
around blackness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revolution. As reporters, we were on the inside,
watching it all and telling of it as it happened.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just about skin color. This fact hit me with a bang
when, while covering my Harlem beat, I met two brothers, Elombe and
Kwame Brath.
</P>
<P>
   The Braths had been putting on the ``Naturally'' shows for years
_ shows that focused on black hair styles and fashions _ without
many people noticing. Still they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   But this was 1966 and times were changing. ``Naturally 1966''
caused a sensation. The shows featured women who were called ``the
Grandassa models'' (named after ``Grassaland,'' the name that
African nationalist leader Carlos Cooks applied to Africa).
</P>
<P>
   The models had very dark complexions. And instead of
straightening their hair with hot combs, they wore ``naturals,''
later called ``Afros,'' which meant hair groomed and worn
naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandassa models were stunning. They were so dark that their
faces had a bluish shimmer. People described them as
``blue-black.'' You saw them and your mouth just fell open.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were ready,'' Elombe Brath recalled. ``The time was
right.'' And it was. A lot of women took to the ``natural'' look.
And nobody was neutral: You either liked it or you didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For us reporters, the ``race story'' was not simply about
covering riots. It was far more compelling than that, far more
socially significant. We realized we were at the eye of a profound
social shift.
</P>
<P>
   Our growing colony in New York City changed too, and in a
significant way. We were not all male anymore. Ruth Ross broke
through at Newsweek magazine. She started as a researcher in 1964.
In 1966, with the race story as important as any other, she became
the first woman to join our contingent as a reporter on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   And there was something else: A lot of black reporters also put
away the hot combs, the Dixie Peach, the Murray's hair dressings
and the stocking caps and showed up for work sporting ``Afro'' hair
styles.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a few newsrooms, all hell broke loose. At a TV
station where she was a reporter, Melba Tolliver was told that she
could not go on the air unless she first put on a scarf or
something to cover her Afro. She refused, but the station did not
back down until a black protest was mounted.
</P>
<P>
   At some other news outlets, editors ordered black reporters to
get hair cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible for me to separate myself entirely from the
movement that I had been thrust into. The ``roots'' that were being
examined were my roots too. And the activists pushing for this
change were young, many of them about my age. I gravitated to their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It rang true for me when they derisively attacked the word
``Negro'' (``knee-grow'') as something from cotton patches and
plantations. I was ready to shake ``Negro'' off too. The word
``black'' made sense. It linked black America to black Africa. I
wanted to be called black.
</P>
<P>
   I got rid of my hair grease and stocking caps. I let my hair
grow natural. The Afro I cultivated was modest, but that was the
way I wanted it. I could connect with the movement on the streets
and as a reporter, and still be considered promising by my white
editors at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they understood.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is a born-again Protestant who says Jesus Christ
is the philosopher who most influenced him. John McCain is a
born-again Protestant who testifies that his faith helped him
survive a POW camp. Al Gore is a born-again Protestant who says he
frequently asks himself ``W.W.J.D?'' And Bill Bradley is a
Protestant who, though he refuses to discuss his faith, belonged to
the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and evangelized his basketball
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant monopoly on this year's major presidential
candidates may seem an aberration. John F. Kennedy's election
supposedly cracked the religious wall in presidential politics, and
the overt prejudice that barred Catholics, Jews and Mormons from
national elective politics has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Jews, who used to obsess about the first Jewish president, no
longer think about the issue. Presidential campaigns have become as
ecumenical as a Unitarian seder. Since JFK, candidates have been
Mormon (Orrin Hatch), Jewish (Arlen Specter), Eastern Orthodox
(Michael Dukakis) and Catholic (Ted and Bobby Kennedy, Bruce
Babbitt, Pat Buchanan and -- surprise -- Alan Keyes, among others).
</P>
<P>
   The president on the TV show ``West Wing'' is even Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   But life is not imitating art. Though non-Protestants comprise
at least 35 percent of the American population, Kennedy remains the
only one ever elected president. And of the 14 major party nominees
since Kennedy's death, only Michael Dukakis was not a Protestant.
(Barry Goldwater's father was Jewish, though Goldwater was not.)
And there are good reasons to believe that the Protestant monopoly
will persist.
</P>
<P>
   America has not returned to the bad old days of know-nothingism
and anti-Semitism. The Protestant monopoly no longer stems from
prejudice. Americans insist they would vote for a presidential
candidate of almost any religious background. In 1937, 46 percent
said they would vote for a Jewish presidential candidate, and 47
percent said they wouldn't. In 1999, 92 percent said they would
vote for a Jew, and only 6 percent wouldn't. In 1958, 27 percent of
Americans said they would not vote for a Catholic. In 1999, only 4
percent said they wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Though folks probably pretend to be more tolerant than they are,
the virulent anti-Catholicism that cost Kennedy 2 million votes has
vanished, as has most anti-Semitism. No one would dream of hinting
that a Catholic president would take orders from the pope, as some
did in 1960. Mario Cuomo says he ``never even considered the
possibility'' of anti-Catholic prejudice when he was pondering a
presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   Recent non-Protestant candidates didn't fail because of
religion. Hatch was dreary. Specter was a pro-choice Republican in
a pro-life party. Ted Kennedy never recovered from Chappaquiddick.
Bobby Kennedy was murdered. Buchanan was too vitriolic.
</P>
<P>
   The free pass does not extend to all religions. Seventeen
percent of Americans won't vote for a Mormon, the same as in 1967,
the last time Gallup surveyed about Mormons. Gallup does not poll
about Islam or other religions, probably because not even optimists
believe a Muslim could be elected president now.
</P>
<P>
   As for atheists, forget it. Only 49 percent of Americans would
vote for an atheist presidential candidate _ compared to 59 percent
who would vote for a gay one.
</P>
<P>
   If prejudice isn't blocking a Catholic or Jewish presidency, why
hasn't there been one lately?
</P>
<P>
   First, evangelicals are a huge obstacle to a non-Protestant
Republican presidency. Evangelical Protestants comprise one-quarter
of the population, they favor Republicans by 2-to-1, and they are
concentrated in the Southern states that are the Republican base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the strength of evangelicals and the concentration of
the party in the South, it would be very difficult for a Catholic
to get the Republican nomination for president,'' says Catholic
University politics professor John White.
</P>
<P>
   This constituency is one reason why Bush _ not a Northern
Catholic such as John Engler of Michigan, Tommy Thompson of
Wisconsin, George Pataki of New York, or Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania
_ is the Republican governor running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Demography also damages the presidential prospects of Catholic
and Jewish Democrats. Jews and Catholics populate the Northeast,
but since the Dukakis debacle, the Democratic establishment has all
but abandoned Northeasterners as serious presidential candidates,
concluding that they are too liberal to succeed nationwide. This
eliminates the most promising Jews and Catholics from presidential
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two easiest groups to elect president,'' says University
of California, San Diego professor Sam Popkin, ``are Northeastern
Republicans and border state Democrats'' _ lefty Republicans and
righty Democrats _ virtually none of whom are Catholic or Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion undermines Catholic presidential candidates. A Catholic
candidate's abortion position, no matter what it is, would incite
far more anger than the same position taken by a non-Catholic. Most
Catholics are Democrats and are pro-life, but a pro-lifer can't win
the Democratic nomination. (Witness the ostracism of former
Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey.) And a Democratic Catholic candidate
who was pro-choice would be at odds with a noisy and powerful
church hierarchy and might lose some of the Catholic vote on which
Democrats depend.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican Catholic would have to be pro-life, and that would
bring its own difficulties. When a Protestant such as Bush says he
opposes abortion, most Americans assume that he won't do much about
it. If a Catholic pol said the same thing, voters might believe
that he would act on it. In a general election, pro-choice but
otherwise Republican voters would turn out heavily against a
pro-life Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   (Jewish candidates would be similarly lassoed by Israel. A
Christian candidate's position on Israel hardly interests anyone. A
Jewish candidate's position on Israel would polarize everyone who
has even the slightest opinion about it. But there is no
``Protestant'' issue that could trap a Protestant candidate.)
</P>
<P>
   Money handicaps non-Protestant candidates. Catholics, Mormons
and Jews are less networked than Protestant candidates. (The
Kennedys are the exception.) Dukakis raised millions from the
Greek-American community but lacked access to the old-line and
corporate cash that fed George Bush. George W. Bush got the nod
over the Catholic governors in part because he could raise millions
more than they could.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential monopoly also continues because of the style of
religion in American politics favors Protestants. Americans demand
public professions of faith from their presidential candidates.
Religion serves as a proxy for morality. As the wall between church
and state has crumbled, candidates have felt more obliged to
discuss their religion.
</P>
<P>
   Such God talk never occurred a generation ago. ``It was
inconceivable that Nixon or Eisenhower would talk about their
personal religion, but it is becoming de rigueur that a candidate
do that today,'' says Notre Dame history professor John McGreevy.
</P>
<P>
   This religious revelation benefits Protestants. Protestantism is
America's normal religion, practiced by 60 percent of the
population. Americans are more familiar with Protestant language
and concepts than Jewish or Catholic ones.
</P>
<P>
   More important, profession of faith is itself a Protestant idea.
The foundation of evangelical Protestantism is ``testimony'' about
your discovery of Christ. Such public testimony is anathema to Jews
and Catholics, who almost never talk about their personal
relationships with God.
</P>
<P>
   Protestantism is individualistic, while Judaism and Catholicism
are communal. A Protestant presidential candidate can speak about
her beliefs in personal terms without seeming to impose them on
others. Protestantism is an individualist faith fit for an
individualistic culture.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholicism and Judaism are ``we'' religions. Protestant
language tends to be personal and nonjudgmental. Catholic language,
by contrast, insists on absolute communal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic and Jewish candidates must choose either of two
approaches. One is to avoid talking about their faith. Dukakis
didn't even nod at our civic religion. He would have lost anyway,
but his relentless secularism undoubtedly cost him votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, though a Protestant, is hurting his campaign by
rejecting religious talk. Black voters, who tend to be religious,
are a core Democratic constituency, and Gore is wooing them by
riffing constantly about his religious journey. Political analysts
say that one reason Bradley may be polling so poorly among blacks
is that he refuses to discuss his faith.
</P>
<P>
   The other choice for Catholic and Jewish candidates is to speak
of their faith and hope it works. Some Catholics, notably Pat
Buchanan, have alienated voters with coercive, collective rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Catholic can only get elected president by talking like a
Protestant,'' says John Green, director of the University of
Akron's Bliss Institute.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, none of the obstacles to a Catholic or Jewish
president is insurmountable. But collectively, they block most
potential candidates from even considering a run, and they cripple
those who make the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would have to find a fairly conservative Catholic or
Jew, who's not from the Northeast, who is pro-choice but also
publicly religious, who is comfortable talking about personal
faith, and who is connected to lots of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would have to find a well-connected Catholic who can
thrill Southern evangelicals with his conservatism but won't scare
away moderates with his strong pro-life views. Good luck!
</P>
<P>
   There is a final way a non-Protestant could become president.
Either party might name a Catholic, Jewish, or Mormon vice
presidential candidate. After eight years as second fiddle, a
Catholic veep would be well-positioned for a presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   But that backdoor to the White House may be the only door open
to Catholics, Jews and Mormons for some time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Who says a ski vacation is only about skiing? Or about skiing at
all?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in the old days folks headed north just to strap on the
boards and point downhill, but that was before fitness clubs, hot
tubs, snowshoeing, and, yes, computerized indoor golf courses.
(Read on.)
</P>
<P>
   With the right planning, there's no need to ski at all on a ski
vacation, unless you really want to. Put another way, if you're
taking several days to ski with the family next week during school
vacation, there's plenty to do for all ages besides actually skiing
downhill.
</P>
<P>
   For example, virtually all major ski areas in New England, and
many minor ones as well, offer cross-country skiing. Killington,
Okemo, and Sugarbush in Vermont, Waterville Valley and Sunapee in
New Hampshire, Sunday River in Maine, and Wachusett in
Massachusetts, to name only a few, all have cross-country trails
and equipment rentals, if not right at the slopes, then nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Trail fees range up to about $15, with another $15 or so for
daily equipment rental.
</P>
<P>
   Most areas also have snowshoes for rent, and for that, one
doesn't even need a trail. Often, you can find little headlamps to
light the way through fields and woods during night snowshoe treks.
Rentals are usually about the same price as cross-country skis.
</P>
<P>
   Ice rinks abound, and fitness clubs are everywhere with workout
rooms, pools, hot tubs and daily membership fees. Sugarbush Health
and Racket Club, for example, (802-583-6300) charges $13 a day for
use of the pool, weight room, indoor and outdoor hot tubs, steam
and sauna rooms. Court time for tennis, racquetball, and squash is
$20 an hour, but then they knock the daily fee down to $9.
</P>
<P>
   Tubing on the slopes after the lifts close (free some places, as
much as $5 at others) is gaining ground as well, and nearly every
place has horse-drawn sleigh rides and hayrides. At Waterville
Valley, for example, sleigh rides leaving from the village square
are $10 for those 13 and older, $5 for younger children, and free
for the youngest children sitting on a parent's lap. (603-236-8175)
</P>
<P>
   At Stratton, weekend sleigh rides (adults, $17; children, $12;
under 2, free) include a bonfire with hot chocolate and s'mores.
(802-297-9210).
</P>
<P>
   Then there's golf. Really. Okemo just opened an astoundingly
high-tech Winter Indoor Golf Academy (802-228-1396) with an array
of virtual-reality gizmos, including a 700-square-foot indoor
putting green complete with undulations and breaks; a computerized,
full-swing simulator so you can pretend to play all the fancy
courses (try matching Tiger Woods's 31 on the back nine at Pebble
Beach); and a three-dimensional, computerized system to analyze,
and correct, your swing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Okemo spokeswoman Pam Cruickshank, the Vermont
resort joins Arizona, Florida, and Puerto Rico as the only spots in
the country with a setup like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many people are crossovers,'' says
Cruickshank. ``They're skiers and they're golfers, too. A lot of
people ski during the day, and then go to the golf course, play a
round of golf, and go out to dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   The simulator rents for $50 an hour, which can be split among
several golfers. Private lessons and clinics also are available.
All ages welcome.
</P>
<P>
   At the Balsams Wilderness resort, way up in New Hampshire near
the Canadian border, you could spend an entire ski vacation
indoors. (603-255-3400).
</P>
<P>
   Most people stay at the Balsams hotel, as there aren't many
options nearby. First-run movies show nightly in the hotel's
250-seat theater. Wine tastings and cooking demonstrations are
regular affairs. Several furnished fireplace areas provide what
Balsams spokeswoman Bonnie Clymer calls ``cozy nooks'' for reading
or playing board games. Ping-Pong and billiards are popular in the
game room.
</P>
<P>
   All the indoor activities, plus ice skating on a lighted rink
and snowshoeing, are included for those paying the $150-$170 per
person, per night, double occupancy room rate. (Children are $9 per
night, multiplied by their age.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We find half our guests come here and don't ski,'' says
Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   Killington opened an indoor climbing wall this year at Snowshed
lodge for all ages. Designed by Josh Bruckstein, co-owner of Green
Mountain Rock Climbing Center in nearby Rutland, the wall is 26
feet high and takes up the entire end of a large lunch room.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Bruckstein and Chris Borodenko, also a climber
and an artist who painted the wall to look like wintry New England
countryside, helped several people climb with ropes and harnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skiing is a lot more physical and requires coordination,''
said Heather Mellen, 25, a lawyer in the New York office of Boston
law firm Goodwin, Proctor &AMP; Hoar. ``This is more mind over matter.
So if you're getting too banged up as I was, this is a good
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Bryan Raiche's mother works at Killington, and
he'd been up the wall a couple of times before. Still, he said,
eyes wide after a brief climb, it felt ``pretty dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see me?'' he asked, full of pride. ``I didn't go all
the way up 'cause my feet couldn't reach the other ledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The wall costs $10 for three climbs.
</P>
<P>
   If that all seems a little much, though, for what is supposed to
be a week of crisp mountain air and winter sports, how about a
snowy hike through the state park at Wachusett (Visitors Center,
978-464-2879), a guided night snowshoe trek to the stone cottage in
which author Pearl Buck stayed near Stratton (802-297-2200), or
horseback rides through frozen woods from Edson Hill Manor
(802-253-7371) near Stowe, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Stowe, in fact, has among the most varied activities. In
addition to the horseback riding (all ability levels, 10 years and
older), the Helen Day Art Center off School Street is open
Tuesday-Saturday, noon-5 p.m. (802-253-8358) For the next several
weeks, a photo exhibit includes Eugene Atget's photographs of
Paris, Berenice Abbott's photos of New York City, and Jules
Backus's pictures of the stencil art of Paris. A $2 donation is
requested.
</P>
<P>
   From 8 a.m.-6 p.m. seven days a week, visitors to the Cold
Hollow Cider Mill in nearby Waterbury (802-244-8771) watch cider
being made while munching fresh donuts made on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest draw, however, and conceivably the most popular
tourist attraction in all of Vermont, according to Stowe's Kirt
Zimmer, is the Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice cream factory, also in Waterbury
on the Waterbury Stowe Road. Take the $2 tour weekdays, 10 a.m.-5
p.m., every hour and the half-hour, and get free ice cream samples
at the end. (802-244-5641)
</P>
<P>
   At Stratton, after the lifts close Tuesday and Saturday night,
ride up the mountain in a car towed by a snowcat to dinner at the
midpoint restaurant (802-297-2200). Watch the groomers, take in the
view, and learn what goes on at the slopes after the lifts close.
</P>
<P>
   Waterville Valley offers moonlit tours (or at least nighttime
tours) of the countryside on snowshoes or cross-country skis
(603-236-4666), and tubing from 5:30-9:30 p.m. at the main ski
area.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if skiing really is what you like, there's plenty of
that, even for spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Stratton, for example, has what they call a ``border cross
competition'' Saturday nights. Skiers, snowboarders, and ski
boarders (those people with a tiny snowboard strapped to each foot)
compete over an all-terrain course. You can watch from the
slopeside restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Or, any day in any lodge at any ski area, just find a window
seat and watch the crowd outside: the fashion, the falls, the
grace, the technique. It's terrific theater.

PUTIN RIVAL VOWS SOME DIRT FOR THE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russia's federal prosecutor, Yury Skuratov
presumably knew some of the Kremlin's deepest, darkest secrets.
Now, as a besieged outsider running for president, he is
threatening to tell all.
</P>
<P>
   His target: the acting president, Vladimir V. Putin, who is
heavily favored to win next month's presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   Of Russia's 15 presidential hopefuls, Skuratov's bid for the
Kremlin seems one of the most quixotic. Shunned by most of Russia's
political elite, he barely registers on most opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Skuratov, who lost his job as prosecutor last year after he
began investigating Kremlin corruption, said his campaign is less
about winning power than about telling the Russian people the truth
about Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a sober man, and I understand that my chances are not
great. But I want people to know what they are voting for. I want
them to know who Putin really is,'' Skuratov said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Skuratov, Putin serves the interests of a group of
politically connected businessmen and bureaucrats, known here as
``The Family,'' who wielded enormous influence under President
Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Putin ``part of the criminal group that rules Russia,''
Skuratov claimed to have compromising material on the acting
president that he would reveal during the election campaign. He
declined to give details.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Putin's personal involvement in corruption goes,
there will be a discussion about this in due time,'' Skuratov said.
</P>
<P>
   But in more ways than one, Skuratov has earned a reputation as
the prosecutor with no clothes.
</P>
<P>
   While the fight against corruption is the centerpiece of his
presidential campaign, he himself stands accused of graft.
Moreover, for months, Skuratov has teased the public with promises
to reveal dirt on Putin. But when asked for specifics, he has said
over and over that it was not yet time.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his term as Russia's top law-enforcement officer,
Skuratov was assailed by his enemies as a do-nothing prosecutor.
When he decided to take on official corruption, after Russia's
financial collapse in August 1998, he went all the way _
implicating Yeltsin, his closest advisers and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, he accused Yeltsin and his daughters of taking
bribes from a Swiss construction firm called Mabatex that had won
lucrative contracts to renovate the Kremlin. This month, Swiss
prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for a former Yeltsin aide,
Pavel Borodin, in connection with the Mabatex case.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov later claimed to have information that 780 current and
former government officials had used inside information to trade on
Russia's once-lucrative treasury bill market.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a hostile prosecutor, Yeltsin's inner circle moved
quickly to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   In a move widely seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to discredit
Skuratov, Russian state television aired a videotape last March of
a man resembling the prosecutor frolicking in bed with two
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin then suspended Skuratov after law enforcement officials
said the prostitutes had been provided by organized crime figures
seeking the dismissal of criminal cases against them.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov became the target of another criminal inquiry this
month alleging that he had received bribes in the form of free
business suits from Mabatex _ the Swiss construction firm that
Skuratov said bribed Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov has denied wrongdoing. He said that the videotape was a
fabrication and that the suits had been given to him as part of his
official Kremlin wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``These criminal cases are attempts to pressure me,'' Skuratov
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who vote for me will be voting against corruption. Any
fight against corruption needs to start at the very top, with the
Kremlin,'' Skuratov said, adding: ``We have a saying in Russian:
The fish rots from the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov is one of 15 people who have submitted the 500,000
signatures necessary to run for president. So far, Russia's
Electoral Commission has officially registered only Putin, the
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, the nationalist leader Alexei
Podberyozkin and the Kemerovo regional governor, Aman Tuleyev.

SKOCPOL ON MAKING THE SYSTEM WORK FOR WORKING FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALYSSA HAYWOODE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE MISSING MIDDLE 
Working Families and the Future of American Social Policy 
By Theda Skocpol 
Norton, 207 pp., $25.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a teenager struggling into baby clothes, America is making
do with undersized political ideas. Take the popular debates:
Welfare reform looks at a sliver of the population; promises of tax
cuts often focus on another small group, the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Those left out are described in the title of Theda Skocpol's new
book, ``The Missing Middle: Working Families and the Future of
American Social Policy.'' These people, Skocpol writes, ``are
working men and women of modest economic means . . . who do most of
the providing and caring for the children who represent the future
of American society, while paying the taxes that sustain
retirees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Missing Middle'' is a straightforward policy read. But
between the lines is a rousing warning: Don't settle for
``restricted politics,'' the circus train of stereotypes, quick
fixes, and shortsighted moralizing. Skocpol blames liberals,
conservatives, progressives, and politicians alike for their
political tunnel vision, and criticizes the stylish but sometimes
hollow rhetoric of the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The book's strength is its mix of analysis, journalism, and
common sense. Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology,
makes the social-scientific case to back up parents' experiences:
Government policies haven't caught up with today's challenge of
raising children and earning a living.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there's a ``historic formula for success in
American social policy.'' We just have to remember what worked and
why. Skocpol's examples include Civil War benefits, public
education, and the Social Security Act.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time in what sounds like a Tom Hanks movie, the
American Legion pushed for the historic and successful GI Bill. The
Legion was ``instrumental in persuading Congressional
representatives, including skeptical Southern conservatives, to
enact the very generous and comprehensive 1944 legislation.'' In
the 1910s and 1920s, organizations like the National Congress of
Mothers and the General Federation of Women's Clubs won programs
for mothers and children.
</P>
<P>
   These programs, Skocpol says, shared four traits: reliable
sources of public revenues; constituents from different social
classes; the backing of voluntary organizations that worked with
government; and the perception that they rewarded service or helped
people prepare for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Current events are analyzed in a chapter that dissects
stereotypes _ not of minorities but of the elderly. Skocpol
punctures the myth of fat cats cruising on golf courses while
Social Security checks fill their bank accounts and the American
Association of Retired Persons bullies Congress. This chapter could
stand alone as an invaluable example of how a kernel of truth _
that these days, benefits are skewed toward the retired elderly _
can explode into fabrications.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Skocpol briefly laments what might have been.
After the civil rights efforts of 1955 to 1965, there might have
been full-employment programs or universal health coverage _
dignified government support for all citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Her larger goal, however, is to expand the debate over what
might be; hence the appeal of her final chapter. Its list of
proposals presents political and logistical challenges. But even
those who disagree with Skocpol should be impressed by her breadth.
Her sweeping proposals expose a vast, largely ignored continent of
ideas. These include an AARP-type organization for parents;
universal access to paid family leave financed by employer
contributions and general tax revenues; and using the Social
Security Trust Fund to finance ``GI Bill-style loans'' to college
students that would be paid back through automatic payroll
deductions. Instead of being solely the art of the possible,
politics, Skocpol shows, can be the art of great possibilities.

SUN WILL SHINE ON LUNA ROSSA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I really haven't, as accused, waited to write an America's Cup
prediction column until all my colleagues of the Fourth Estate
wrote theirs, and then cued off their predictions. Yes, I have read
most of them. Almost all predict New Zealand will win this thing
over Italy, if not with ease, at least decidedly.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, the camps opened their gates and let the public
witness ``the dropping of the skirts,'' a curious sort of pre-Cup
holiday now institutionalized _ in sailing only of course.
</P>
<P>
   What it means is the secretive shrouds keeping the underside and
appendages of the IACC racing yachts hidden from view are finally
dropped away in a show of frankness aimed at surpressing the
espionage that in past Cups has proceeded at a feverish and
undignified pace.
</P>
<P>
   What we saw at ``Declaration Day'' is just what we expected. The
camps are using variations of the same narrow boat with bulb wings
placed in somewhat different positions: New Zealand has winglets
placed amidships on the bulb while Luna Rossa has chosen the more
conventional aft positioning.
</P>
<P>
   Can anything be gathered from a half-hour look at the two
undersides? Of course not. However long the ``experts'' looked and
debated the boats this week, there is only one way of knowing which
is faster: put them in the water next to each other. That will
happen Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It might be worth mentioning that after sailing 15 races against
each other, Luna Rossa and AmericaOne still have no clear answer as
to whether boat speed was the major factor in Prada's comeback 5-4
win over AmericaOne in the challenger finals.
</P>
<P>
   In some conditions, on some points of wind, Luna Rossa looked
quicker, but in other situations Paul Cayard and company had the
legs they needed to run away from Italy's red-trimmed silver
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   So we just might find that boat speed is not a factor in the
coming best-of-nine Cup match. Like the finals match, picking the
correct windshifts and crew work may easily trump the speed card.
</P>
<P>
   Before predicting the winner, let me bare my heart and say that
New Zealand is perhaps the sweetest place I have ever visited. The
lifestyle is gentle, intelligent, cultured. Kiwis are sports-minded
but prefer rational, thoughtful conversation to the kind of
mindless brawling that passes for discourse in our country. (No, I
will never listen to Howie Carr or Rush Limbaugh again.)
</P>
<P>
   From the country's stunning physical beauty to the South Pacific
climate, to the wonderful seafood and home-grown wines, New Zealand
should be the very next destination of anyone planning a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   So that's what my heart says: Let the Kiwis have at least one
successful defense of the Cup. The fabulous venue they have built
here will be the America's Cup standard from now on. They are
marvelous hosts, and the sailing waters here are challenging and
infinitely interesting.
</P>
<P>
   But rationality intrudes. I'm afraid the Kiwis will be slightly
off the pace for this America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago in San Diego there was absolutely no question
about how the script would play out. New Zealand had come to town
with boats from a different speed zone and everyone knew it. The
only question was: Could the US defender skippered by Cayard win a
single race in nine? Answer: No. Never, said Cayard, had he felt so
hopelessly unable to affect the outcome of a regatta in which he
sailed.
</P>
<P>
   It came to me while watching Race 8 of the finals. Prada was
down, 4-3, to AmericaOne and a loss would send them home. Never
since January 1998 had the Italians felt this kind of pressure.
Syndicate boss Partizio Petrelli had thoroughly scolded his team.
Tactician Torben Grael looked demoralized for having made the
losing call in Race 7. How could the Prada team come back, relying
on boat speed only?
</P>
<P>
   But rather than play it safe, Grael and Prada skipper Francesco
de Angelis came out superaggressive and tried to tag out Cayard in
the prestart. Then, catching AmericaOne too close to windward on
the second leg, they luffed Cayard into a penalty that won Luna
Rossa that critical race. They sailed with the kind of risky,
roughneck bravado that they learned from none other than Cayard
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all those days, in fact every day for over two years,
Team New Zealand has had only mock races. With no other defender to
spar with, the kind of battletoughness that the Prada team brings
into this match has simply been unavailable to the Kiwis.
</P>
<P>
   Luna Rossa designer Doug Peterson also designed Black Magic, New
Zealand's runaway Cup winner in 1995. He knows both boats
intimately, and though he is obviously not unbiased, he said, ``New
Zealand have a problem. They're on a completely different page.
They're going to look very bad very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Without wishing any such harsh judgment on Team New Zealand, my
pick is Prada's Luna Rossa, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh Luna Rossa (red moon), are you waiting for me?'' goes the
maudlin Italian folk song.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to it. We're going to hear ``Luna Rossa'' plenty in the
days ahead.

DIRECTORY PUTTING ITS SWITCH TO THE IPO TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet investors have no problems thinking outside the box.
But can they think outside the book?
</P>
<P>
   Switchboard Inc. of Westborough, Mass., the big telephone
directory service on the Internet, will be pitching its initial
public stock offering in a road show next week, with plans to hit
the market by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Switchboard, which urges its customers to ``think outside the
book,'' is looking to raise as much as $60 million in an IPO that
would value the company at about $284 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer,'' said analyst Suzanne Chase of Burnham
Securities, who follows Banyan Systems Inc. of Westborough, a
majority owner of Switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   By Internet standards, Switchboard is an old-timer, with a track
record that dates back to 1996. Hopes for an earlier public debut
were dealt a setback when Switchboard lost a critical Web
relationship in fall 1998 and dramatically redirected its business
last year.
</P>
<P>
   America Online killed a marketing agreement that had referred
AOL customers to Switchboard's directory and signed on with
competitor Infospace Inc. instead.
</P>
<P>
   About 45 percent of Switchboard's 1998 revenues were tied to
agreements with America Online. Traffic to the phone directory site
plunged when the relationship ended. Switchboard, which attracted
5.5 million unique vistors in October 1988, pulled in slightly less
than half that audience in December 1999, according to Media
Metrix, the Internet traffic tracking firm.
</P>
<P>
   Switchboard ranked a distant second to Infospace and its 6.9
million unique visitors among Web directory sites in December. But
fans believe the company did the right thing for its long-term
prospects by not paying up to keep the America Online pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of pie-in-the-sky out there, and when
everything shakes out, those who have build real business models
will survive _ and there's a phenomenal opportunity,'' Chase said.
``I believe Switchboard will be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the idea the Switchboard stock offering is any IPO
stick-in-the-mud. It is still contemplating a beginning stock
market value more than 30 times its total 1999 revenues of $8.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Switchboard redirected its business last year through two key
deals. Banyan sold a big piece of the company to CBS Inc. in June,
in return for $95 million worth of ads and promotion and $5 million
in cash. CBS now owns a 41 percent interest in Switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   The company also moved into the local advertising market in a
big way, lining up with Discover Financial Services to identify and
pitch merchant advertising accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Switchboard's directory to pull up all the hotels in a city
and a series of display advertisements appear on your computer
screen, along with all the listings.
</P>
<P>
   It's a way to dig deep down into the economy for new Internet
advertising, but Switchboard's strategy involves thousands of small
clients spending relatively short money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local (Internet) commerce and advertising have not developed
as quickly as many have liked,'' said Chris Charron, research
director of media and entertainment at Forrester Research in
Cambridge. ``Local marketers don't spend a lot of money on online
advertising, and they are slow to embrance online commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Charron said the slow growth of local advertising and the niche
nature of the Internet are two serious problems facing so-called
big-book telephone directories on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   He said companies like Switchboard will do well to repackage
pieces of their databases over and over to reach many small
targeted audiences on the Internet, ``slicing and dicing'' the
information it has already collected.
</P>
<P>
   Another key development for directory companies: wireless
communications. Infospace has respun its entire business as a
technical infrastructure for wireless Web services that most
experts believe will take off like a rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your cell phone for the Chinese restaurants in the area, and
a list pops up on the handset. Push a button, and the phone dials
you through.
</P>
<P>
   Switchboard doesn't describe any grand wireless plans in its
stock-offering documents, but analysts say it's still early in the
wireless game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this race for the wireless space is really just
beginning,'' Charron said.

SOUTH CAROLINA IS BESIEGED BY BUSH-MCCAIN WAR OF WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Donna Baker can hardly believe what is
happening on her television. Every time she looks at the screen,
there is an attack ad by George W. Bush or John McCain, or a news
story about the Republican presidential primary that invariably
focuses on the negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen so many ads. I don't even want to turn on the
television,'' said Baker, who lives in nearby Dorchester, South
Carolina. ``All the mudslinging. They think the average person is
stupid and doesn't know when to come out of the rain.''
</P>
<P>
   After a New Hampshire GOP primary that focused mostly on issues
and featured relatively few attack ads, the contest here is as
different as North and South. To hear some South Carolinians tell
it, this has become the political equivalent of Sherman's March,
with the candidates slashing and burning their way through the
state.
</P>
<P>
   It is anything but genteel.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly overnight, from the Low Country to the booming suburbs
upstate, South Carolina is being inundated with far more primary
advertisements than ever before. The campaigns, having long ago
purchased air time in Charleston and Columbia, recently began
gobbling up television advertising slots in neighboring North
Carolina and Georgia, hoping to reach residents there. The roads
are crawling with the biggest media contingent ever to hit the
state, all to record what is expected to be the biggest and most
important GOP primary turnout in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the federal spending limit for candidates in South
Carolina is about $1.5 million each, although additional spending
is allowed for many expenses such as bookkeeping and salaries.
Bush, who is avoiding the limit by rejecting federal matching
funds, plans to spend at least $3.1 million to buy ads.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has a $2.8 million ad budget here, according to his media
consultant, Greg Stevens. The Bush campaign says McCain's spending
violates the limit, but McCain aides said they are obeying the
limit because much of the ad budget is being spent in the
out-of-state media markets such as Savannah and Augusta, Ga., and
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   However the accounting is done, this sudden influx of at least
$6 million by the two campaigns into the radio and television
markets seems to have turned the South Carolina airwaves into a
nonstop political infomercial _ much of it ceaselessly negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never seen anything like it,'' the state's Republican
Party chairman, Henry McMaster. ``It is several times more intense
than before.'' The reason is clear to McMaster: ``The presidential
election is going to be decided here on Saturday. Whoever wins on
Saturday will be president.''
</P>
<P>
   While that prediction remains to be proven, there is no doubt
that South Carolina is awash in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   In prior campaigns, the primary was important, but the
candidates spent far less time here because they were competing in
numerous states at once in a shorter time period. This year, there
is an 18-day gap between the New Hampshire and South Carolina
contests, interrupted only by a minor Delaware primary that McCain
skipped. The result is that candidates are putting far more money,
time, and emphasis on the state.
</P>
<P>
   If either candidate loses by a significant margin, his
presidential hopes might be over.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to overstate how different the campaign has become in
South Carolina. In New Hampshire, McCain, a former Vietnam POW, was
fond of saying that he was waging a ground war, village by village,
holding 114 town meetings and spending 71 days in the state. While
he certainly faced criticism from Bush, the Texas governor did not
run a series of televised ads against him.
</P>
<P>
   But in South Carolina, with more than three times the population
of New Hampshire, McCain has held only 35 town meetings and has
visited the state for 30 days, campaign aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush has put aside his softer New Hampshire
advertising style and launched an airwaves war against McCain. That
prompted McCain to respond with an attack that likened Bush to
President Clinton. McCain later pulled the ad amid signs that it
was undercutting his reformer image and said he would not run any
more attacks during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how these ads will affect the election. In most
states, politics is about the future. But in South Carolina, it
often seems like it is about the past.
</P>
<P>
   Rare is the political discussion that doesn't eventually touch
on slavery, the Civil War, the civil rights movement, states'
rights, and the state's historic shift from the Democratic Party to
the Republican Party. Bush partisans say the state usually backs
the establishment candidate, while McCain supporters say the state
is a haven for mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Jim Miles, a McCain supporter who is the
second-ranking elected Republican in the state, said that
understanding the state's history is crucial. South Carolinians
have an affinity ``for the swashbuckling image. There is a sense of
independence here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ever forget,'' Miles said, ``this was the state that
fired the first shot'' in the Civil War, or the War Between the
States, as it is still called here.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the shots are mostly being fired over the airwaves. The
result is clear on leading newscasts such as WIS-TV in Columbia,
where the ads run regularly and the primary coverage is
all-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty much all presidential primary all the time,''
said WIS anchorman David Stanton, who said that both the ads and
the coverage are much more intense than past primaries. ``I don't
think there is any comparison,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the campaigns keep their exact spending private until they
file reports, the McCain campaign believes that Bush is running far
more advertisements. In the latest buy, Bush will air a 30-minute
informercial on some local stations.
</P>
<P>
   The radio airwaves also have been flooded. When a reporter drove
for two hours from Columbia to Greenville the other day, a flip of
the dial found repeated ads paid for by Bush that attacked McCain.
The ads, some of them running on religious broadcasts, charged that
McCain's tax plan would make it more difficult for people to make
tax-deductible donations to churches. (McCain says the plan would
only close a loophole used by the wealthiest donors.)
</P>
<P>
   Another round of ads, paid for by the National Right to Life
group, attacked McCain's position on abortion. During this
unscientific sampling, no pro-McCain ads were heard.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush broadsides clearly have rankled McCain, who spent much
of Tuesday's debate complaining about the attacks, which included
leaflets and telephone calls from the Bush campaign. With primary
day fast approaching, the question is whether the intensive
coverage and attacks will heighten or lessen turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, the voter who is disgusted with all the ads, said she
plans to ignore the attacks when she heads to the voting booth
Saturday. But, she said, repeating a phrase uttered often in New
Hampshire, ``I won't know who I'll vote for until I walk in
there.''

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Business calls are muffled or routed to his
cell phone. E-mail messages to his partners can only be sent via
special accounts. And letters and packages go directly to his
anonymous mailbox at a nearby post office.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Tseng is not a drug dealer or political dissident, but, for
much of the past year, the 20-year-old Harvard Internet
entrepreneur has been forced to act like one.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many schools throughout the country, the nation's oldest
university has long maintained, if not always enforced, stringent
rules against students running businesses in dorms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something they impress on us from the very
beginning,'' said Tseng, a cofounder of an online textbook sales
company. ``A lot of people here are pretty paranoid about the
rules, but it's hard to absolutely follow them.''
</P>
<P>
   Student-run businesses at Harvard are nothing new. The most
notable is Bill Gates's launching of Microsoft in the mid-1970s, an
endeavor that provoked administrators to reprimand Gates for using
university resources for personal profit.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter century after the billionaire's pioneering days at
Harvard, a mushrooming number of student-founded computer companies
on campus is forcing the university to reconsider its policy.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent student-faculty meeting, the Harvard College dean,
Harry Lewis, proposed rewording the severe language in the
university's student handbook to permit undergraduates to engage in
``modest'' business activities from their dorm rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become aware of the fact that a number of successful
businesses started when their founders were undergraduates and
posed no problems,'' said Lewis, referring to such
multimillion-dollar startups as Chipshot.com, a site selling golf
equipment. ``So we decided that a blanket prohibition was no longer
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, however, won't be a blanket endorsement for free
enterprise on school grounds. If the faculty approves Lewis's
proposal in a meeting later this spring, students will still have
to abide by a list of regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The young capitalists will have to get permission before doing
business in their dorms and avoid using their dorm addresses,
university e-mail accounts, or Web sites for business, and they
will still be prohibited from disbursing goods from their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When business-related activities are permitted, care must be
taken to avoid excessive use of university resources, misuse of
university facilities and information provided primarily for
Harvard's teaching and research missions, and activities that might
jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the university or its
property,'' the proposal states.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said there are at least three other lingering concerns
about revising the policy: Harvard's name could be expropriated or
entangled with student businesses; students might lose sight of
their primary goal of getting an education; and computer servers
and other resources could be bogged down by increased use.
</P>
<P>
   Student entrepreneurs discount the importance of such concerns
and say they doubt whether new rules will make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any changes will have little to no effect on student
startups,'' said Peter Weed, a senior who founded The Crimson
Business Group, a company that helps students launch new
businesses. ``Most of us already ignore the rules anyway. That's
part of the reason they're talking about changing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, in fact, has rarely taken disciplinary action against
students running business from their dorms. ``Typically, we notice
something, tell the student to stop, and the student stops,'' Lewis
said. ``So the problem goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Baker, a junior who runs Datesite.com, which boasted of
matching 175 couples only two weeks after launching last February,
said the proposed rules won't really affect him, since his company
is already established.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a bit worried about it last year,'' Baker said. ``But
we're settled now, and we have little need to use university
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Andrew Chung and Matthew Ebbel, whose Web business,
Collegebeans.com, undercuts university bookstores, say new rules
would help those in the early stages of a business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not that there are cameras or anything in the
room,'' Chung said. ``It's that You're always worrying you might do
something wrong that will jeopardize your degree. This should make
it easier on new startups.''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining why the university is considering relaxing its
rules after so many years, Lewis said that 70 percent of Harvard
students now hold jobs because of their financial aid requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those students, he said, work out of their dorm rooms,
designing or monitoring company Web sites. Those jobs, Lewis said,
``can't be distinguished'' from those of students who are
proprietors of their own Web-based companies.
</P>
<P>
   For Greg Tseng, the administration's change of heart is good
news.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his tiny dorm room, Tseng, a Harvard junior, clicks
on his Web site, Limespot.com. Just by pulling up his site's bright
orange opening page, he wonders whether he's violating university
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the problem now,'' he says. ``There's a lot of fear
you're going to do something that's going to get you in big
trouble.''

 UNDATED: ... vent-free units.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wright advises going to a specialty retail hearth store for
installation and service and, of course, purchase. ``You may pay a
little bit more, but they'll be able to give you a greater range of
options and what is most suitable for your square footage and
decor.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Wright says, with homes now so airtight, negative pressure
can build up and cause back-drafting down a traditional brick
chimney, introducing harmful exhaust into the home. Therefore, the
sealed gas-combustion units prevent such drafts and reduce concern
about air quality in a home.
</P>
<P>
   Another boost to the increasing popularity of gas fireplaces is
improvement in log technology. The first ``pretend'' logs only
glowed and had an odd, bluish flame. Today, logs have a more
authentic yellow, flickering flame with burning red embers
underneath that send off from 20,000 to 40,000 BTUs of heat an hour
(35,000 BTUs heat 1,500 square feet).
</P>
<P>
   To put gas logs, which are ceramic or glass, in an existing
wood-burning fireplace, you must by law disable the damper so the
flue remains open. There is loss of heat up the chimney, but this
can be lessened by installing glass doors when the logs are not
being used. To install the log unit, a plumber must drill into the
basement and hook up the gas logs to the existing gas line, says
Black Magic's Gignoux. The flames from these logs will be larger
and more realistic, but this is offset by the loss of heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People buy these for effect rather than for heat,'' says
Gignoux.
</P>
<P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Brian Cormack, a salesman at Affordable Windows and Doors in
Newton, Mass., says he bought a home nine years ago that had no
fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we added a family room, we really wanted a fireplace, but
couldn't afford the expense,'' says Cormack. ``I stumbled on a
direct-vent gas unit at the August West store in Hingham, Mass. It
would cost me one-third of what it was going to cost me to put in a
masonry fireplace. I put in a black granite hearth and surround and
it ended up costing me about $2,300 compared to $6,000 to $8,000
for a brick fireplace. We used it all the time. It was a great
source of heat and so easy to operate. I had a remote, so I just
clicked it on from my chair.''
</P>
<P>
   Cormack has recently moved to another home where there is no gas
line on the street. He has decided to install an electric
fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   Gas stoves are also enjoying a new popularity, according to
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are wonderful space heaters because the heat radiates
from six sides, they now have a wide expanse of glass in front, and
they're attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   And like fireplace units, they vent directly thereby avoiding
those tall, ugly pipes reaching up through the ceiling out to the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in New England aren't wild about putting a stove in the
living area,'' says Gignoux. ``But there are pluses _ a stove is
free standing with no mantel, hearth, or tile surround.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looks are important
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, he says, it's looks that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stove is like a piece of furniture,'' says Gignoux. ``Looks
are very important, and it is the woman who usually makes the
decision about what type of unit to buy. We have this very
efficient stove that just isn't selling well because people don't
like the look, even though it's a workhorse, very efficient, and
the cleanest burning.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright says that not enough attention has been paid to the
aesthetics of these units and that the industry must give the
consumer more options _ that manufacturers must offer five, six, or
seven choices instead of the present two or three.
</P>
<P>
   And for folks who must have wood burning in their fireplace,
there is also a solution that avoids the expense of brick and
mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hanna, partner in S. &AMP; H. Construction, lives on the second
floor of a two-family house in Cambridge where there was no
existing fireplace. He built out a wall, put in a zero-clearance,
metal firebox, framed around it, and then snaked a stovepipe up
through the third floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't like the idea of piping in gas,'' says Hanna.
``There's something real primal about a wood fire. It's warm and
hypnotic. We like hanging out in front of it. I order a cord and
have the kids carry the logs up from the basement. At night, I pull
the wire-mesh screen across, pull back the rug, and go to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Wright sees continuing improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``A microchip will be placed in the gas log units to regulate
the flame and more closely mimic real fire,'' says Wright. ``Plus
the new fires will begin slowly like a wood fire, roar when it
catches, and smolder in the end. These chip products will be on the
market within the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, there'll be fireplaces that are installed on an
outside wall that are glass on both the inside and outside _
thereby allowing people to enjoy a fire while sitting on a deck on
a cool summer evening.''

SHE'S HIGH PRIESTESS OF THE HOUSE-PROUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ &UR;  &LR; As soon as she saw the galley proofs of ``Home
Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House,'' trend-sensitive
domestic titan Martha Stewart invited author Cheryl Mendelson onto
her TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mendelson writes that good homemakers are good list
makers, Stewart asked for her lists. ``So I grabbed some from the
refrigerator. They were written on torn envelopes and whatever. But
when we started filming, they had copied out every item on my lists
in round handwriting on the nice type of yellow legal paper!''
</P>
<P>
   Mendelson is laughing as we sit at the small round kitchen table
in her Upper West Side apartment. A thoughtful and precise woman of
53 with cinnamon-colored hair and a passing resemblance to Susan
Sarandon, she is respectful of Stewart but offers an alternative
vision of homemaking, focused on making things work well, rather
than look good. In fact, Mendelson could be called the anti-Martha.
</P>
<P>
   The author, whose housekeeping encylopedia has been a surprise
bestseller (it's now in its seventh printing, with 160,000 copies
in print), gets her ``home comforts'' from a clean kitchen and
crisp linens on a freshly made bed rather than from fashioning wine
coasters from twigs and color coordinating candles with the
dinnerware. She even suspects that such craft and decorating
projects are often seized on as substitutes for housekeeping skills
by people who are trying to make their domiciles more homey, but
don't know how.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last couple of generations, Mendelson believes, the
very real know-how required for housekeeping has been devalued and,
to a large extent, lost, like a language people stopped speaking
and nobody wrote down. So she herself wrote it down. She spent
eight years researching and writing about subjects most people
avoid even thinking about. The results are more than 800
comprehensive pages on neatening, serving meals, laundering,
ironing, and cleaning, a kind of ``Joy of Cooking'' for housework.
It sounds dull, but actually makes almost hypnotic reading.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing many people want to know about Mendelson is
whether she's obsessive-compulsive. They assume she must be. In
fact, she says, a tad combatively, ``that's who they want me to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely manifesto
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In promoting her book, the author has found herself leading a
charge against the common cultural assumption that a person who
enjoys housework must be crazy. And ``Home Comforts'' has become an
unlikely manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   Her apartment kitchen is old-fashioned and cozy. It's bitterly
cold out, and she moves my chair next to one of the radiators so I
can warm up. (She believes a home should be, above all, welcoming.)
She makes a pot of good coffee, using a vacuum pot coffee maker.
(``Home Comforts'' has a section evaluating coffee-making
techniques.)
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen tablecloth is patterned with cheerful cherries.
Almost everything else is white. But the refrigerator casually
plastered with those lists and family photos in full view is
reassuring. A decorator recently told me it was tacky to put
anything on my own refrigerator, and I have been struggling with
this injunction ever since. Now I can't wait to get my magnets back
out.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Mendelson, a Harvard-trained lawyer with a PhD in
philosophy; her husband, a Columbia English professor; and their
8-year-old son share a large university-owned apartment with a
dining room, living room, kitchen, laundry room, two home-offices,
two cozy bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a long hallway.
</P>
<P>
   There is so little clutter the place looks almost
underfurnished. I'm aware of spaciousness and light, rather than
objects.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the apartment holds enough books to stock a library.
There are, by my count, 24 white floor-to-ceiling bookcases, all
installed by the Mendelsons. There are also about two dozen white
overhead cabinets in the kitchen, and half of these were added by
the family.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is everything in its place, but there's a place for
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost. There are three bikes in the dining room. ``We
have no place to put them,'' she shrugs. ``They flit around from
hallway to dining room to office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most housing was built when people owned many fewer things,''
says Mendelson. ``They just don't have the storage space that
people need today.'' My house was built in 1829, and I immediately
make a mental note to engage the services of a cabinetmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Mendelson learned housekeeping from her grandmothers when she
was growing up on a farm in the Appalachian corner of Pennsylvania,
where 19th-century ways survived into her 1950s' childhood.
</P>
<P>
   One grandmother was Italian, the other Scots-Anglo-Irish, and
they differed mightily on whether beds should be made up
immediately each morning or aired out, whether ironing was a waste
of time or the queen of household arts, whether sunlight should be
invited in or sealed out, and whether red-eye gravy or garlic
belonged in a healthful meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were always asking, very casually, as if it were
unimportant to them, `How does your other grandmother do it?' ''
recalls Mendelson with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   This rivalry launched Mendelson on the road to evaluating
varying homemaking techniques, and also to setting them in a
cultural context.
</P>
<P>
   After her family moved to the Florida suburbs, Mendelson focused
on academic achievement and tried to abandon, or at least hide, her
interest in domestic matters to fit in with her new world. It
seemed bourgeois and politically incorrect, especially to her first
husband. But after a period of ``antidomestic posturing,'' her true
nature reemerged. She recalls the nadir as the time she came home
to find their wet muddy dog and two belonging to friends romping on
their bed to her husband's complete indifference. She cried. ``It
was probably our only pair of sheets and I couldn't stand the
thought that I had no bed to sleep in.''
</P>
<P>
   What she has written, after divorce, practicing law (which she
found true drudgery), and remarriage, is partly a philosophical and
lawyerly argument in favor of good housekeeping, as well as a
how-to book.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A range of responses
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hot potato. I don't get an indifferent response. The
most excited readers are young, well-educated women who don't know
how to keep house. But some politically based women see it as
regressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendelson says her book is aimed at both genders and advises
couples fighting the chore wars to negotiate for maintenance jobs
that each enjoys. (According to a recent study, though men still do
much less housework than women, men now average 10 hours a week
compared with five in the prefeminist era of the early 1960s.)
</P>
<P>
   The Mendelsons split homemaking 50-50, each doing about 10 hours
a week, not including cooking time. (Her husband tells me he
especially enjoys neatening closets when putting off grading
students' papers.)
</P>
<P>
   The Mendelsons also have a weekly housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   They see no inconsistency in this.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does the basics, like dusting and vacuuming. But I do the
harder stuff. It's my house. I wouldn't ask any paid employee to
clean my kitchen floor on their hands and knees, but I'll do it
twice a month,'' says Mendelson. ``I do the tops of the
bookshelves, the corners, the backboards. But not every week! I do
one room a week, in depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Mendelson may not be obsessive-compulsive, but she has no
doubt that bad housekeeping can kill you. ``Home Comforts'' devotes
many pages to deadly bacteria, electrical safety, slips and falls,
proper disposal of hazardous household wastes, tap-water
temperature, and potentially lethal garage doors. This is a book
that tells you what to do if someone's clothing catches on fire.
Slightly unnerved after reading the dates on her food storage
chart, I realized I should toss every condiment I own, most of the
frozen food, and all of the jelly. Those pathogens are sending
their tentacles straight for the bottom of the jars.
</P>
<P>
   Mendelson is particularly focused on child safety. Her son's
room is probably the cleanest in the house. Many of her son's
classmates are ``little wheezers,'' she says, referring to the
increase in childhood asthma. ``It's important to reduce exposure
to allergens in children's rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   History of housekeeping
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She got the idea for her book from the antique homemaking
manuals she collects. ``Housekeeping changed tremendously between
1900 and 1950! People got electric lights, hot water,'' she says.
The biggest improvement was in laundry day, which actually used to
use up two days a week, one for washing, one for ironing.
</P>
<P>
   But except for the microwave, there was remarkably little real
improvement in homemaking between 1950 and 2000, she says. ``My
grandmothers would be completely comfortable here. The biggest
change has been the phenomenal growth of consumer goods. Those
great big houses won't make people happy. They'll need a lot of
help to take care of 10,000 square feet. People are better off with
2,000 to 3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Homemakers used to follow a standard weekly routine. Monday was
washday, and when Mendelson walked to school in rural Pennsylvania
on Monday mornings, ``every woman would be hanging out her first
load.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of cleaning as crisis management, Mendelson advises
easing into such a schedule: ``Habitual things don't feel hard.''
Her current routine is:
</P>
<P>
   Monday: washing and ironing.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday: cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday: odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday: marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Friday: minicleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday and Sunday: all done.
</P>
<P>
   She and her family also do morning and evening neatening
``blitzes,'' and she has boxes and drawers sanctioned as ``holding
stations'' for mail, school papers, and other objects waiting to be
sorted and shelved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of superficial neatness,'' Mendelson says.
``It's utilizing organizational systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The doorbell rings. As she strides down the front hall to
welcome another guest, Mendelson scoops up a visiting child's
backpack without slowing, tosses it against the wall, then sends a
wayward umbrella in the same direction with a quick, efficient
little kick.

FOR MAGAZINES AIMING AT YOUNG GUYS, IT'S FLESH WARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the flesh wars raging on America's newsstands, score one for
Gear magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Stuff magazine poses actress Alicia Witt in her underwear while
Maxim magazine uses barely bikini-clad model Kim Smith to front for
its swimsuit issue. Details goes with undressed actress Virginie
Ledoyen while the inaugural cover for FHM (For Him Magazine) opts
for actress Rachael Leigh Cook in a microscopic two-piece outfit.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the new issue of Gear with its career-altering
seminude shots of Jessica Biel _ teen star of the popular WB
family-values show ``7th Heaven _ that generated a buzz that
bounced from the New York tabloids to Newsweek. (On Tuesday, ``7th
Heaven'' executive producer Aaron Spelling filed a $100 million
lawsuit against Gear in connection with the photo spread and
accompanying article.)
</P>
<P>
   This glossy battle of pulchritude is not about the models and
actresses who adorn the magazines' pages, however. It's about the
young men who stare at them. In April 1997, a British import called
Maxim came ashore here, changing the face of both publishing and
pop culture. A philosophical descendant of the early Playboy
magazine, tamer than skin magazines, and less literary than GQ or
Esquire, Maxim became a magnet for 20-something professional males
who wanted frothier and fleshier lifestyle journalism. (The
magazine's unrepentent motto is ``sex, sports, beer, gadgets,
clothes, fitness.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tapping into the downscale side of an upscale urban
male,'' says Tony Silber, editorial director of Folio, the magazine
for magazine management. ``Nobody had ever tapped into that market
until Maxim.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then everyone's jumped into the fray. Last year, Maxim
unveiled sister publication Stuff and this past week, the US
version of the British magazine FHM was launched. A year-and-a-half
ago, Bob Guccione Jr., son of the Penthouse magazine publisher,
rolled out Gear. Conde Nast's Details _ which has tinkered with
different formulas over the years _ is now trying to evolve from
what its editor calls a ``Maxim look-alike mode.'' Such
high-mindedness, however, entails risk. When P.O.V. magazine
recently folded, some observers blamed it on a failure to compete
vigorously enough on the sex-and-suds front.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been some P.O.V.-like casualties, the new
wave of men's magazines still seems to be building. Three of the
entries are less than two years old, Gear just upped its
publication schedule from bimonthly to monthly, and Stuff is poised
to do the same. The magazines' combined rate base _ the circulation
figure they cite for their advertisers _ is closing in on 4
million, not counting FHM. According to figures at the end of 1999,
Maxim's 1.66 million circulation _ which more than doubled in a
year _ is greater than GQ's and Esquire's combined. And Brill's
Content magazine recently named Felix Dennis, the chairman of the
company that publishes Maxim and Stuff, to its list of 25
influential media movers and shakers.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, all these magazines are trying to answer the same
age-old question. What do (young) men really want?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be adults,'' says Steve Douglas, the general
partner of the Douglas Jones magazine consulting group. These are
``the men's magazines for the guys who don't want to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its fluff, the ``lad magazine'' genre that originated in
the '90s in Britain is attempting to fill a genuine niche in the
male reading market. The once powerful Playboy and Penthouse
magazines were waning, a victim of Internet porn sites and X-rated
videos. And the more highbrow men's publications _ what FHM editor
in chief Ed Needham likes to refer to as the ``cardigan and
slippers titles'' _ have never exactly taken that demographic group
by storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point (of the Maxim trend) is to . . . try to
determine the market for young men'' outside of sports or skin
magazines, says Douglas. They're ``trying to put the `guy culture'
into a printed version.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the temptation to lump all these magazines together,
there are differences of degree if not emphasis. Maxim, Stuff, and
FHM are largely viewed as the lighter fare while Details and Gear
are more likely to dabble in more serious journalism. The
scandalous Biel issue of Gear, for example, includes a lengthy
piece examining the murder charge against pro football player Rae
Carruth and a hard look at AIDS therapies.
</P>
<P>
   The magazines are willing to parse the distinctions even finer.
Steve Colvin, president of the firm that publishes Maxim and Stuff,
says Maxim's ``editorial turn is humorous, irreverent, knowing, and
succinct.'' Stuff editor in chief Andy Clerkson says his magazine
skews a bit younger and ``is more grounded in pop culture than
Maxim.''
</P>
<P>
   Details editor Mark Golin, who formerly toiled at Maxim,
dismisses that publication as ``a few jokes and some babes leaning
over.'' Details, he says, is now interested in producing a ``young
men's magazine that offers a little more substance,'' such as
``pursuing a guy's inner emotional life.'' Guccione calls Gear
``first and foremost an entertainment magazine'' with ``another
level of more solid investigative journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard not to notice some of the staples of this style
of journalism. There are a lot of features involving young women
who gather in a room, imbibe alcohol, and then discuss the do's and
don'ts of sex. Memorable sports brawls and tragedies are a favored
topic as are stories about escaping avalanches. There is plenty of
light service journalism with an emphasis on gadgets, gizmos, and
male fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing unites these competitors like the pages of
photographs of nubile and nearly nude women. One is tempted to say
the magazines are simply selling sex. But that's a harder sell when
every post-adolescent male is a few mouse clicks away from
no-holds-barred Internet porn and when their photos are no racier
than those in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about sex,'' says Needham. ``Sex is an ancient
physical act that various civilizations have struggled to come to
terms with. It's about sexiness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests sex without showing it,'' adds Steven Cohn, editor
in chief of the Media Industry Newsletter. ``In the old sex talk,
it maybe goes to third base and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Colvin espouses the idea _ certain to be disputed in some
quarters _ that these pictorials are more worshipful than
exploitive. ``The attitude of Maxim is `Hey, women are great,' ''
he says. ``We love women. They're better than us really.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the popularity of these publications, Guccione puts
it in terms that are more sociopolitical than sexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the nerve the genre has touched is the death of
political correctness,'' he says. ``It was seen for what it was,
empty rhetoric. It was a faux social movement. I think what
happened is men were made to feel dirty for having natural,
instinctive interest in sex.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one other subtle marketing mechanism embedded alongside
all the sexy pictures. In their own breezy fashion, these magazines
do dispense advice _ on relationships, fashion, and finance _ to
their readers. But they studiously avoid the preachier ``build
better abs'' or ``be a better lover'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   These magazines are ``about how to make relationships more
fulfilling (but) without the `honey, read this,' '' approach, says
Douglas. ``It's been very hard to write for the guys on lifestyle
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the latest British invasion here to stay, redefining once
and for all the men's magazine? The verdicts are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The category is hot as hell,'' says Douglas. ``The attempt to
break this category open . . . will be a breakthrough. It's been a
. . . project ever since Esquire launched.''
</P>
<P>
   Many estimates are bullish, suggesting the genre may have an
upside of 10 million-plus readers. Others aren't so sure. ``I've
been a little skeptical of it overall,'' says Cohn. ``The men's
advertising market is much weaker than women's.''
</P>
<P>
   The record in England _ where the ``lad mags'' are beginning to
level off _ may foretell its future here. The Maxim wave worked in
that ``suddenly, there was a magazine for guys who weren't looking
for journalism,'' but ``looking for a laugh,'' says Golin. ``Over
here, it's a larger country. It'll take them a little longer to
plateau.''

BUSH PUTS ON A MCCAIN MASK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRMA, S.C. -- The only question left before South Carolina votes
in 48 hours is which John McCain is going to win the pivotal
primary here.
</P>
<P>
   All remaining doubts that George W. Bush is no longer running as
himself went flying out the window in the hours before the
revealing debate Tuesday night among the real McCain, a
surprisingly effective Alan Keyes, and this character who has
remade himself into McCain Faux while trying to paint the real
thing as false.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor spent his public hours before the debate in
this small community near Columbia presenting what he insisted was
a new proposal on a subject he couldn't care less about: campaign
finance reform. This foray into McCain territory was the latest in
a slew of maneuvers since New Hampshire voted that are designed to
ape as much of the McCain campaign message as possible to blunt its
attraction and to slur the Arizonan as everything from a
cash-guzzling hypocrite to the true ``insider.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing amazes me any more in this age of short attention spans,
sound-bite coverage, and 30-second ads, but the extent of this
latest fraud is particularly stunning. The $70 Million Man has been
saying for months that he favors banning the unlimited cash gifts
known as soft money made by corporations and labor unions, but not
those made by wealthy individuals, thus preserving the part of the
status quo that has a documented record of producing the worst
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, he tried to package such absurd, ``new ideas''
as banning contributions from ``lobbyists'' to members of Congress
while it is in session, as if chief executives like Bush himself
could be trusted to take dough year-round. And, in another
gratuitous slap at legislators, he pretended to feel it is
``unfair'' that politicians can take surpluses from their campaign
funds and transfer them to jump-start campaigns for higher office
(as McCain did last year).
</P>
<P>
   McCain was right to call it a joke and right to say that Bush's
ideas would preserve the essence of the soft money system. Bush's
``proposal'' was a confession of just how much his victory here is
dependent on selling the idea that he is not all that different
from McCain, that he's a reformer, too. The fact that he would
judge it worth the ridicule to make such a proposal just four days
before the primary tells all about his fear that this race is
anything but decided.
</P>
<P>
   And in a race that is being decided at the last minute, it was
interesting that also-ran Gary Bauer endorsed McCain, citing not
the social issues on which he campaigned most strenuously but the
broader goals of reforming the money system and breathing new life
into the GOP. The truth is that so-called religious conservatives
are anything but monolithic this year, and Bauer has standing with
more populist activists who detest the establishment that Bush
represents.
</P>
<P>
   That goes double for Alan Keyes. In its preoccupation with
McCain, the Bushies forgot about Keyes, who has the potential to be
a thorn in their side in an election that might be decided by a
tiny number of votes. On Tuesday evening, Keyes's supporters were
thrice buoyed.
</P>
<P>
   First, Keyes did an excellent job as referee-judge when he
dissmissed the inevitable two minutes of bickering over campaign
tactics by Bush and McCain as a smokescreen for insubstantial
candidacies. He was so effective that the subject never arose
again, to the relief of the live audience of Bush-oriented
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Second, on Keyes's central issue of abortion rights, his
supporters felt Bush exposed himself as crassly political on an
issue they care about fervently. Like Bush, they favor no change in
the Republican platform's support of a no-exceptions constitutional
amendment outlawing abortion, but they view Bush's personal
advocacy of exceptions as hypocritical. His inability to explain
why he wouldn't work to advance his views is to them an example of
someone who sees abortion more in political than moral terms.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Keyes has won praise for his journey into the
fundamentalist lions' den at racialist Bob Jones University not
only to preach conservatism but confront the school over its ban on
interracial dating. Keyes's stance contrasted dramatically with the
see-no-evil visit by Bush earlier this month and his inability to
explain why he had a meeting with an organization whose policies he
disagrees with but refused to meet with the gay Log Cabin
Republicans. His false claim that the gay group was supporting
McCain only made the cynicism of his position more obvious.
</P>
<P>
   McCain lacked energy Tuesday evening. He also suffers from his
original decision to put negative commercials on the air here. But
the bottom line is that his opponent goes to the voters Saturday
with a truly bizarre pitch: Vote for me because I'm the real John
McCain and the real John McCain is an impostor.

MISSTEPS AREN'T SLOWING RUSSIA'S TEFLON LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   MOSCOW _ OK, so maybe raising the price of vodka in a land where
people on average drink 28 bottles of the stuff a year, but who
have little money to spare, was not the smartest thing for a
presidential candidate to do six weeks before election.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the message from Russia's acting president,
Vladimir V. Putin, who backed away Tuesday from his Cabinet's
announcement last week of a 40 percent price increase for a bottle
of vodka.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it was not the best move for a contestant in a
democratic election to announce, as Putin did last week, that he
would not tell voters his plans for Russia until after the vote, so
that it would not become ``an object of attack.''
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, maybe such distaste for debate solidifies
concerns among liberal Russians that this former KGB spy's
presidency might threaten the still-shaky elements of free society
established under President Boris N. Yeltsin's eight-year term.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be what Putin was saying when he announced that
he would unveil his political program next week.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good thing for Putin that he is so popular, that the
state-run media that back him are so powerful, and that his
opponents are so weak.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was propelled to acting head of state by Yeltsin's
resignation on New Year's Eve, Putin has been feeling his way,
committing gaffes with a frequency that would cripple a lesser
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another conclusion to be drawn from Putin's first
month as acting head of state: He is not really sure what he wants
to do.
</P>
<P>
   As one Putin adviser put it: ``First he should get elected, then
he will figure out what actions are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   This makes sense, argued two Putin advisers, who in keeping with
the campaign's clandestine style asked not to be identified. Putin
has never run for election and has little experience in politics,
although they say he has shown himself to be quick to recover from
his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's main job, the advisers said in interviews, is not to
alienate the Russians who might vote for him. That includes, his
advisers and, other analysts say, pretty much anyone, except for
Russia's relatively small liberal minority, whose members tend to
oppose the war in Chechnya and will probably side with another
candidate, Grigory Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from promising to keep up the military campaign in
Chechnya, the largely popular war that helped bring him to power,
and promising to strengthen the power of the Russian state both
inside the country and internationally, themes that have been
popular among Russian politicians since the mid-1990s, Putin has
avoided taking definitive positions on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he takes a stand,'' said an analyst at a think tank that
advises Putin, ``he'll lose part of his rating.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin remains purposefully vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any program should start from the revival of people's
morals,'' he told reporters after his candidacy was formally
approved. Denying that he has shrouded his political intentions, he
pledged to present a full'-issues platform next week.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Putin has been vague at best. He has promised to
strengthen government's role and develop a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   He has spoken of the need for a free press, but has praised the
state-owned media for supporting the war in Chechnya while
straining to limit coverage by the rest of the press.
</P>
<P>
   He has promised to fulfill Yeltsin's pledge to create a
professional army, but without abolishing the draft.
</P>
<P>
   He has suggested a referendum on lifting Soviet-era restrictions
on private ownership of land, without staking a firm position on
whether he supports the idea or not.
</P>
<P>
   He has talked about political stability and the need for foreign
investment, but has offered few clues on how he plans to provide
the first to attract the second.
</P>
<P>
   And, critically for the business ``oligarchs,'' as they are
called, who control Russia's most lucrative assets, Putin has
talked about guaranteeing ``equal privileges for all'' _ but has
promised not to probe the dubious privatization deals that
empowered them.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say this last promise is the main reason Putin was
plucked from among Yeltsin's cabinet to lead Russia. They say
Putin's main task is to preserve the oligarchs' power, and their
access to the state budget, two features of Yeltsin's Russia often
blamed for the economic stagnation of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is naive to expect that Putin will start dismantling the
robber capitalism system when its most symbolic figures are key
shadow players in Putin's game,'' a political analyst, Andrei
Piontkowski, wrote in The Russia Journal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is said to be affiliated with several well-connected
financial groups, especially the oil and financial conglomerate
Alfa Group and the oil major Sibneft, and the talk in Moscow is
that negotiations are underway with groups that backed Putin's
opponents in last December's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``For top-level politicians in today's Russia, affiliation with
oligarchs is like being in the Communist Party was under the Soviet
Union,'' the political adviser said. ``You can't get there without
it. Of course Putin will be thinking about the interests of
oligarchs. Right now, there is a battle among the oligarchs for
Putin's allegiance.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration adviser to Putin characterized the leader as a
novice politician in an unfamiliar position, likely to make
mistakes that occasionally alienate voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is natural, since he does not have a team of his own in
place, but instead is using a hybrid _ Yeltsin's old
administration, people he brought into government from Alfa Group,
his own confidants'' from his previous job as head of Russia's
Federal Security Service (the successor to the KGB), the adviser
said. ``The good news is that Putin seems to realize his mistakes
quickly and make the right response.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that a 40 percent increase in vodka prices was a
blunder, Putin said Tuesday that ``the government has taken no
decisions on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people in our country, unfortunately, cannot afford to
drink cognac or whiskey,'' he told reporters. ``Whether or not they
are celebrating a holiday, when it comes to hard liquor, Russians
drink vodka. That's why any issue concerning vodka cannot be
considered a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Putin's other ``mistakes'' and successful recoveries,
according to the adviser:
</P>
<P>
   --A suprise move to fire two senior military commanders in
Chechnya last month, at a time when Russia was bogged down and
needing a victory. (Putin fixed that a few days later by awarding
the commanders with medals.)
</P>
<P>
   --He hesitated before opposing a rule proposed by Russia's
Central Bank last month to require exporters to exchange all of
their hard currency earnings for rubles, instead of 75 percent; not
only did the business leaders oppose the idea, so did many ordinary
Russians, who keep their money in dollars to hedge against years of
sharp drops in the value of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   --He decided to form an alliance with the Communists in
parliament, which gave him control over the lower house but which
came off as a cynical and heavy-handed power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been done much more subtly, by getting liberal
factions involved in a power-sharing deal, which would have been
much less disturbing to people,'' said the political researcher who
works for Putin. ``This move made people fear that in Putin's
Russia, power will act without concern for procedures and
traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, after heated debate, parliament loosened its stance,
appointing two liberal politicians as deputy speakers. But a Moscow
political scientist, Sergei Markov, argued that Putin's Communist
courtship made a point with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forming a union with the Communists and snubbing the liberals
was a good way of showing most Russians that Putin is not a tool of
the liberals, but his own man, and someone closer to the way most
people feel,'' Markov said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar case is the story of Andrei Babitsky, a reporter for
the US-funded Radio Liberty, who disappeared in Chechnya after
Russian authorities there detained him, then said they had handed
him over to rebel fighters in return for Russian soldiers, then
denied doing anything to him.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups and journalists have protested that the
authorities decided to get rid of Babitsky for his hard-hitting
coverage of the setbacks and brutality of the Russian campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than explain the situation, Putin has casually brushed
off questions. His advisers do not see this as a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls show that people want order; the Kremlin has been able
to characterize Babitsky as someone who was working against the
Russian army in its effort to bring order to Chechnya,'' the
Kremlin official said. ``Liberals and free-press advocates are
offended, but their position in Russia is weak. Liberal values in
Russia have no strong support, and freedom of the press is a
fiction outside Moscow.''

MICROSOFT WHEELS OUT WINDOWS 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Microsoft Corp. is launching Windows 2000, its
most ambitious and complex software ever, a project that has taken
nearly four years and cost an estimated $1 billion in development
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   And if all goes well, users won't notice a thing.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Redmond, Wash., company's $200 million
marketing blitz, Windows 2000 is its most reliable operating system
to date, allowing users to run computers smoothly for months, even
years, at a time without crashing.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, it is supposed to be a crowning achievement, one
that is expected to bring the company $1 billion in revenue this
year, according to some Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of popping champagne corks, the company has been
busy this week putting out fires and trying to assure a skeptical
public of the worthiness of its latest product, aimed at business
users.
</P>
<P>
   Looming over Microsoft's parade are several clouds _ ranging
from competition from the upstart Linux operating system to reports
that the software may contain tens of thousands of bugs in its
massive program code.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has been dismissing these clouds, but their presence
has nevertheless dampened the company's stock price. Since last
Thursday, Microsoft shares have fallen 7.9 percent, closing Tuesday
at 97 5/8, down 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   The slide began Friday, when Gartner Group, an influential
research organization in Stamford, Conn., reportedly warned that
companies will be slow to adopt Windows 2000 because more than 10
percent of existing software may not be compatible with the new
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks came a day after Michael Dell, head of Dell Computer
Corp., told analysts he did not expect a ``massive immediate
acceleration'' in computer sales from Windows 2000. Gartner Group
analysts and Dell have since tried to clarify their statements,
insisting their comments were taken out of context. The market
reaction to Gartner's warning ``was way off the map,'' said Tom
Bittman, a research director at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   But the damage had been done. Microsoft shares tumbled nearly 6
percent to $99.94 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   More bad news came over the weekend. Reports surfaced about an
internal Microsoft memo that counted 63,000 potential bugs in
Windows 2000. The memo, unearthed by online publisher Sm(at)art
Reseller, set off a flurry of debate over what constitutes a bug.
Microsoft, acknowleging the memo, insists the 63,000 count included
thousands of minor comments or suggestions made by its automatic
bug-finder, a software tool called Prefix.
</P>
<P>
   ``That account was completely inaccurate,'' said Craig
Beilenson, Microsoft's lead product manager for Windows 2000.
``Prefix is so sensitive that it finds thousands of false
positives. It flags things that aren't really problems. It's
ironic, because hundreds of independent analysts have been saying
that Windows 2000 is a rock-solid product.''
</P>
<P>
   Beilenson pointed out that Microsoft sent out 750,000 test
copies of Windows 2000, its largest testing effort ever. Then
again, analysts say that's not surprising, given that Windows 2000
is the company's most complex software, with close to 30 million
lines of programming code.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to dispel doubts, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates is
expected to announce that Windows 2000 has been running on
thousands of its customers' computers for months, without major
glitches. Other issues remain, though.
</P>
<P>
   In the desktop arena, sellers of the upstart Linux operating
system have been making a small but noticeable dent in Microsoft's
share of the market, capturing just under 4 percent _ making it the
third most widely used operating system, after Microsoft's Windows
and Apple Computer's Macintosh OS, according to International Data
Corp. of Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   The rate at which businesses will leap to buy Windows 2000 is
expected to be fairly slow in the beginning, not only because of
the expense but because companies are loath to abandon their
existing computer systems and learn new ones.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly true of the market Microsoft is targetting
with two of the three versions of Windows 2000 being released: for
the larger, more complex, and more expensive computer systems
called servers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dominates the market for desktop operating systems,
with an 87 percent share. But it captured just 30 percent of the
dollars spent on server software last year, according to
preliminary estimates by IDC.
</P>
<P>
   Unix-based operating systems (sold by Sun Microsystems Inc., IBM
Corp., and Hewlett-Packard Co.) accounted for 53 percent of the
amount spent on server software last year, said Dan Kusnetzky, a
program director at IDC.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Microsoft is expected to take longer to make
headway in a market that already has significant competitors.
Gartner Group estimates 3 percent to 6 percent of servers will be
swtiched to Windows 2000 by the end of this year, but that the
figure will leap to nearly 50 percent by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are just going to be more cautious and take their
time,'' Bittman said, especially since Unix is widely viewed as
being more reliable than Windows 2000. ``Without a doubt, Unix is
far more stable. But it also costs more.''
</P>
<P>
   Systems running on Windows 2000, he said, can be 25 percent to
75 percent less expensive, primarily because Windows 2000 can run
on less expensive computers that use Intel microprocessors _
so-called Wintel machines _ rather than costly proprietary hardware
sold by Sun, IBM, and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is likely to try to exploit that cost difference in
its marketing of Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The cost message is resonating with Cormac O'Reilly, chief
technology officer for Getronics, an Amsterdam-based computer
services company wuth offices in Boston, where O'Reilly works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wintel is an extremely cost-effective platform when compared
with other architectures,'' said O'Reilly, whose company is
converting to an all-Windows system over the next two years. ``For
us, it's almost a 60 percent savings.''

WEB HACKERS MIGHT BE TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who's been hacking into eBay and Yahoo and other popular Web
sites? So far, nobody knows for sure: The technology required for
such denial-of-service attacks has been in the public domain for
months, easily accessible to any malcontent with a working
knowledge of computers. But experts in the Internet underground are
betting that the culprits are adolescent misfits looking for cheap
thrills and bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   They call them ``script kiddies,'' ``code kiddies,'' or ``packet
monkeys,'' brazen teen-agers who use other people's programs to
wreak havoc in cyberspace. To the lay Web user, these ``kiddies''
are mysterious and even dangerous figures. But in the hierarchy of
the hacking subculture, they're at the bottom of the food chain,
vermin who thrive on other people's skills. They're disdained by
serious hackers who view themselves as security vigilantes or
activists who hack with a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably kids in high school who aren't the tough
guys, the quiet shy kids who aren't in the `in' group,'' says Bronc
Buster, a well-known California hacker who broke into a Chinese
government site in 1998 to protest human rights violations. ``They
go home and get on the computer, and they can be the tough guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Such contempt is in the hacking world, where sharp divisions
exist between older and younger generations of self-described
computer geeks. In the realm of hackers, there are three types of
people. The ``black hats'' are criminals who break into computer
systems for malicious reasons, while the ``white hats'' are purists
who will not have anything to do with illegal activity. The ``gray
hats'' exist in the murky area between good and evil: These mature
hackers write programs that reveal security holes in computer
systems and post them publicly on the Internet, allegedly to draw
attention to the flaws.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``script kiddies'' then use those programs to
conduct attacks with no political or professional aim. ``Whoever is
doing this is unsophisticated,'' says Weld Pond, a research
scientist and a member of the veteran hacking group LOpht, which
recently merged with security firm (at)Stake Inc. of Cambridge,
Mass. ``They haven't had to figure out anything new. The guy who
designs the gun has to understand ballistics and internal
combustion; he has to be an engineer. But the person who goes to
the bank and uses the gun is just a hoodlum.''
</P>
<P>
   So why write the programs in the first place? Why put the
weapons in the hands of potential hoodlums? Seasoned scientists
like Pond contend that the only way to demonstrate a security flaw
is to write a program that shows how to crack it. ``It's like the
best way to build an alarm system may be to actually go to jail and
talk with the people who rob houses,'' he says. ``We're trying to
solve problems, not have a religious discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who call themselves ``hacktivists'' claim they write
programs to practice a sort of civil disobedience in cyberspace.
Carmin Karasic, a Quincy, Mass. digital artist, wrote a program
called Floodnet, a tool somewhat similar to the technology used
this week to disrupt Yahoo and the other sites. Floodnet enables
users to request a Web page repeatedly; if it is run simultaneously
by hundreds of users, it can flood a system, making it impossible
for other users to access the site. Karasic and her group, the
Electronic Disturbance Theatre, used the program last year to
target the Mexican government and protest the ongoing war in
Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a place for civil disobedience on line,'' says
Karasic. ``But I don't think you should do this sort of thing
unless there is some clear purpose, like attacking a Ku Klux Klan
site or something. But (the Yahoo attack) makes no sense. It sounds
like script kiddies who are doing it for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, these miscreants act to get attention, but so far, no
one has claimed credit for the recent disruption, which is arguably
the biggest attack in the history of the Internet. Several members
of the hacker underground said a few individuals claimed to know
the identity of the culprits on Internet Relay Chat, an underground
discussion system on the Internet frequented by hackers. But so far
no one has stepped forward; in past incidents when hackers defiled
Web sites, the perpetrators left their signatures on the sites, as
a sort of digital graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   But the people responsible for the attacks would not have gained
praise within their own community. They are being maligned not only
on Internet Relay Chat channels, but also in such on-line forums as
www.slashdot.org, where they were dismissed as ``lame'' people who
``have no life.'' The Internet underground has been trying to
dispel stereotypes of the hackers as something straight out of
central casting, the pasty-faced uber-geek, or the Lone Gunman in
``The X-Files.'' But this week's attacks perpetuated that image,
even within the clubby hacker subculture. ``The stereotypes are
kinda true,'' said Pond. ``We do sit behind the computer 25 hours a
day, getting up only to go to the bathroom and that kind of
thing.'' In this underground world, it can be difficult to tell the
good guys from the bad guys, the black hats from the gray hats.
``If you saw us walking down the street, you wouldn't be able to
tell who we are,'' Pond says. ``If you had a lineup of black hats
and gray hats, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.''

<P>
   Say the word ``fireplace'' and people get a dreamy, faraway look
in their eyes. Not so faraway that images of cavemen huddled before
a pile of burning sticks spring to mind. But back to festive family
holidays, midday warmups after sledding or ice skating, quiet
weekend mornings reading a novel, or intimate evenings with a loved
one sipping wine _ all before a fire crackling in a fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   A fire warms us. Pleases the eye. Smells good. Sounds great. The
connection between hearth and home is so powerfully primal that all
negatives seem to go, well, right up the chimney. People forget
long afternoons chopping and stacking; frigid trips to the
woodpile; tedious lighting and relighting; and the telltale black
holes burned into the living room rug from errant embers.
</P>
<P>
   But times are changing. Even king hearth, the reigning icon of
home, is no longer safe from technological attack. Fireplaces will
continue to be the focal point in a room, but they'll wear
different clothes and operate from a different source. And they
will not disappear _ even in hot and humid Florida, 90 percent of
home shoppers want a fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Hearth Product Association based in Arlington,
Va., the sale of gas fireplaces, stoves, and inserts has increased
dramatically in the past decade from 149,000 in 1992 to almost
800,000 in 1998, a jump of 417 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening in this industry can be summed up in one word
_ convenience,'' says Richard Wright, publisher and editor of
Hearth &AMP; Home magazine. ``It's similar, for example, to what's
happened to FedEx. Everyone was delighted when they came on the
scene and you could get a letter to its destination overnight. Then
along came the Internet. Now people use e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gas fireplaces are so easy and clean,'' says Wright. ``You can
come home, settle into your La-Z-Boy chair, and just flick a switch
on the wall or on your remote, and you've got a fire. Immediately
you have a fire. No fuss, no mess.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, ``70 to 80 percent of the population doesn't even
know these fireplaces exist.''
</P>
<P>
   They will.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cheaper than a brick chimney
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeannie Wahlberg, 35, says she had two criteria when she and her
husband, Bobby, a pipe fitter, moved to a new home with their four
young children _ a fireplace and a view of the ocean. She got the
ocean view in Quincy, Mass., but not the fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never considered a gas fireplace until my brother put one
in, and then a girlfriend did,'' says Wahlberg, a part-time
secretary in a law firm. ``I suppose we could have gone the brick
chimney route, but it would have been so expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our gas unit gives us extra warmth and is the focal point of
our living room,'' says Walhberg. ``It really is as beautiful as a
regular fireplace, and so much cleaner and easier to use. With four
kids, there's no way my husband and I can sit up at night and wait
for a fire to burn out.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more contractors say they are installing gas fireplaces
in new homes. More homeowners are converting their wood-burning
fireplaces to gas by putting in inserts or gas logs. And, because
these direct-vent fire machines are less expensive to install and
more economical than the brick-and-mortar fireplace, more and more
people are installing not one but multiple gas fireplaces in their
homes _ in bathrooms, home offices, bedrooms, and dens.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Dutton, interviewed before he left his position as service
manager of Architectural Fireplaces in New England, says he's seen
the switch to gas skyrocket in the past five years. Of the 40 to 50
fireplaces the company installs per week, 75 percent are now gas.
And these installations are not just in condos or inexpensive
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one site, the homes range from $800,000 to $1 million,''
says Dutton. ``Of the 30 homes at this particular site, only one
has a wood-burning fireplace. Two-income families just don't have
the time for chopping wood, storing it, maintaining a fire, and
cleaning up afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Efficient and versatile
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he adds, there is no heat loss up a chimney because gas
inserts and fireplaces are sealed. And they cost less to install
because there is no $5,000 to $6,000 brick chimney involved. Gas
units can be directly vented to the outside.
</P>
<P>
   They can also be placed virtually anywhere in a home or
apartment and can be finished with surrounds and mantels in keeping
with the traditional appeal of a fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``A gas fireplace still remains the focal point in a room,''
says Dutton. ``In higher-end homes, contractors are putting in
granite hearths, specialized tile and marble surrounds, and
beautifully carved mantels around gas units.''
</P>
<P>
   Gas fireplaces without ducting or trim are priced from around
$750 to $1,500 (this includes the unit and the logs), according to
Perry Gignoux of Black Magic Chimney and Fireplace in Cambridge,
Mass., whose installations are running 67 percent gas to 44 percent
wood. Gas inserts start at $800 and up. A licensed plumber is
required to do the venting and gas work, which can add another $700
or more. And if there's no preexisting fireplace, carpentry work
may include sheetrock and plastering, decorative masonry or tile,
and a mantel.

   Direct vent units work at 70-plus percent efficiency compared to
25 percent for wood-burning fireplaces (heat escaping up the
chimney), according to area retailers and suppliers. And because
gas units can be hooked up to a room's thermostat, they act as room
heaters and can be regulated. Depending on the size, the cost runs
from 20 to 40 cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   And they are safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a ton of safety devices on these units,'' says Paul
Bichun, acount executive for Fireplace Products Inc., which sells
top-of-the-line fireplaces and stoves. ``Massachusetts is one of
the strictest states in the nation as far as codes. Gas units shut
off if they are venting incorrectly or the wind blows out the
pilot. It's really safer to have one of these in your home than to
pump gas at a gas station.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus if the electricity goes off during a storm, a gas fireplace
will continue to work just like the gas stove in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   As for direct venting, Michael Dorion of Fireplace and Patio
Concepts by August West in Boston explains that the vent for these
fireplaces is made up of a tube within a tube. The air comes into
the outer liner for combustion and goes out through the inner tube.
There's no air from the house involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely sealed unit,'' says Dorion. ``You elbow the
vent up and directly out the wall and terminate it outside the
house. It looks very much like a dryer vent from the outside. But
most important, always hire a plumber who is familiar with these
units.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts does not allow vent-free units.

   TAFARA, Zimbabwe _ Dwarfed by a smoke-gray concrete factory
behind it, House No. 11130 sits on the edge of a cornfield, one of
many nondescript brick-and-mortar dwellings in this township
outside Zimbabwe's capital.
</P>
<P>
   But this house is different. The new home of Esther Daiton and
her nine children _ some hers, some those of adult relatives who
died of AIDS, some friends of the orphaned children _ is evidence
that Africa's tragic AIDS crisis is not beyond compassion's reach.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Esther, who has AIDS herself, was told in a
four-part Globe series last October. It prompted an outpouring of
generosity from people in Boston and beyond that fundamentally
changed the lives of her family.
</P>
<P>
   Barely two months ago they huddled against flooding rains in a
dingy wooden shack. Today they share four rooms, each larger than
the shanty they once called home.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, they ate butter sandwiches once a day; now they
have fresh food and meat and go to bed with their bellies full.
</P>
<P>
   The children used to spend their days scrounging for pennies and
waiting for death. Now they go to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never lived in a place like this before,'' Daiton said.
``We have running water and a flush toilet, food and medicine,
blankets, and $1,000 in a bank account.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet 27 years old, Esther has already experienced a lifetime
of loss. In the story of her family lies the devastation of a
continent: whole families lost to AIDS, millions of children
orphaned, governments in denial. Africa is the global epicenter of
the AIDS epidemic. More than 2 millions Africans die each year of
AIDS. One in four adults in Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, and
Swaziland carries the virus that causes the disease. By the end of
2001, 13 million children will be left parentless. Too many more
won't reach their first birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Esther had three children of her own. The youngest died in 1998
at 19 months. Two of her sisters, Naipiri and Maria, also died of
AIDS. So did Esther's third husband. And her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as she herself was sliding into the advanced stages
of AIDS, Esther traveled several hundred miles north to Malawi to
find her orphaned nephews and nieces. She walked, hitched rides
with truckers, and sometimes literally crawled. She had very little
money and almost no food. Not only did she find her sisters'
children, but she also took in three other AIDS orphans.
</P>
<P>
   Once back in Zimbabwe, they lived in a tiny room in a row of
shacks wrapping around the back side of her house. Esther and the
children had to sleep head to toe on a cold floor. They had no
electricity and no money. When she wasn't too sick to stand up, she
sold popsicles to buy bread.
</P>
<P>
   The response to her story was immediate. People sent checks,
letters with $10 notes, and care packages. Island Hospice, an
outreach program in Harare, the capital, helped Esther set up a
bank account and find a new place to live. She still has no
electricity, and the children still sleep on the floor. But the
roof doesn't leak, and Esther has already planted a vegetable
garden out front.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in Esther's life, however, are tenuous. She and the
children look strong and healthy. The money in her bank account may
be enough to pay rent and school fees for a year. But the
government has cut her from its social welfare program, and Esther
has no work. She's searching for an old, nonelectric sewing machine
so she can sew clothes and bedspreads to earn enough for the
family.
</P>
<P>
   And people in the community prey upon her new position. Last
month a woman dropped two children at the house and asked Esther to
look after them for a hour. The woman never returned, and Esther
had to track her down. Last week, two other women and a child were
evicted from a neighboring house, and moved in with Esther.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the longer term, everything is still very uncertain for
Esther and the children,'' said Colletta Peta, a social worker at
Island Hospice. ``But then, they have never lived like this before.
People can be so kind.''

A GOOD, CHEAP CLEANER FOR LAMINATE FLOORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have installed two laminate, faux-wood floors: one Pergo,
one WilsonArt. The spray cleaner sold by Pergo smells and appears
to be a solution of vinegar, alcohol, and water. Can you recommend
a homemade formula for cleaning these floors?
</P>
<P>
   DAVID SCHWOEGLER, &UR;  &LR; San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   A. Any heavy-duty cleaner such as Spic and Span will work well
with all laminate floors. Make a standard solution (for floors) of
Spic and Span and water, and wash the floors with this. Rinsing may
not be necessary (it seldom is with Spic and Span), but certainly
won't hurt. Almost any finish will dull from washing, but polishing
with a dry cloth will restore the gloss. There is nothing wrong
with the vinegar, alcohol, and water solution, except maybe odor,
which will dissipate quickly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to enclose an attached carport with full foundation. I
want to keep the gable roof, which runs into the roof of my ranch
house, to make the project less expensive. But contractors say they
can't dig the foundation hole with the roof in place. In other
words, they say the roof must go. My husband operates digging
equipment; could he shore up the roof and dig the foundation holes
himself?
</P>
<P>
   F.F., Everywhere
</P>
<P>
   A. It is not that the contractors can't, they don't want to. It
would be slow, fussy work _ and that costs money. Your husband, who
works with digging equipment, is a natural for the job. His first
assignment is to contact an architect or engineer to tell him how
to shore up the roof. That gabled roof is structural, a part of the
main house, and any structural work requires the approval of an
architect or engineer. It's the law. And, when digging out the
foundation, be mighty careful not to nudge any of the shoring posts
holding up the roof.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having a fence built with pressure-treated posts and
cedar rails and pickets. The fence man wants to put the posts in
concrete. Is that correct?
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT COMMITO, Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is not correct, in my opinion. In the old days, posts were
put in concrete for stability, but there was no way to keep water
from between the concrete and the post, so the posts rotted out
there in 10 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   Later, wooden posts _ be they pressure-treated, cedar, or any
wood _ were set in earth with several inches of gravel at the
bottom for drainage; the crushed stone helps keep water from
staying around the posts. And that is what your fence man should
do. Try to put the posts 3 feet into the ground; 2 feet is OK, but
not ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Since pressure-treated posts will not decay, there is no reason
to bury them in concrete.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a house full of radiators, and four nice radiator
covers. Is it still a good idea to put aluminum at the back of the
radiator? How about on the sides and under the top?
</P>
<P>
   PHIL NACHMAN, Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Any time you put reflecting metal such as those aluminum
sheets, you will get reflection of heat and light. Even shiny
aluminum foil will work. If you have a full enclosure, you can put
the metal on the back, sides, and under the cover. If you have only
a cover, then the metal goes behind the radiator and under the
cover. Dust the aluminum and keep it polished. A dirty and dull
metal will not do much good at all. The handyman has received a few
brickbats on this subject; one caller said that enclosures tend to
restrict the heat.
</P>
<P>
   They don't, if they have ample front openings. The right design
will increase the radiator's efficiency by distributing heat more
completely, without drafts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My back porch has teak floorboards and steps. The contractor
sealed the wood. Is that acceptable? And should I paint the deck
and steps?
</P>
<P>
   RICH LALLY, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, sealing is acceptable. No, do not paint; you will be
asking for a constant maintenance problem and ugly peeling.
</P>
<P>
   The sealer will make the wood water-resistant, which teak
already is to a great extent. To continue the sealing, it must be
done once a year, but at least there will be no peeling. You can
continue the sealing or simpy do nothing; the teak will turn gray
from weathering whether it is sealed or not. If you want a color,
use a semitransparent stain; one coat will do, and will last for
three to five years. The semitransparent stain will also seal the
wood.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I noticed in a recent column you responded to a query about
the need to protect cedar decking from the elements. Do the same
principles apply to redwood decking? Can I leave it year after
year?
</P>
<P>
   KATHLEEN SMALL, San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think I said that cedar deck boards need protection;
the idea was that you could seal them if you wish. Sealing might
make them more weather-resistant, but would have to be repeated
annually. The same applies to redwood. You can leave it or seal it;
it will make little difference.

OCTOBER SLIGHT STILL SMARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ It was just after noon and, by that time, the
temperature was well into the 80s. Tim Wakefield, his blue T-shirt
flecked with sweat, had finished his workout. He sat on a bench and
began to speak. You immediately noticed the contrast.
</P>
<P>
   Body language: Calm. Relaxed. At ease.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken language: Hurt. Underappreciated. Still sorting things
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to come to camp bitter over something that
happened four months ago,'' the Red Sox pitcher said.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about the strange experience he had in October.
Red Sox manager Jimy Williams told him he wanted to meet with him
in private. ``I thought he was going to tell me I was starting Game
1 (of the American League Championship Series),'' Wakefield said.
Instead, the manager told him that he would not pitch against the
Yankees; he was being left off the ALCS roster. The words surprised
him and stuck with him.
</P>
<P>
   He began the season as a starter. Tom Gordon was injured and
Derek Lowe was not ready to be a closer, so Wakefield became a
stopper. When Ramon Martinez could pitch only three innings in
early September, Wakefield became a long reliever (six innings of
scoreless relief). He never guessed that he would become a
spectator, too.
</P>
<P>
   A month and a half after the season ended, he was still trying
to understand why he wasn't asked to help during the season's most
important series. Williams called him at home so Wakefield would
know where to direct his displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said if I wanted to blame someone, to blame him,''
Wakefield said. But he isn't sure who made the playoff decision.
``I don't know,'' he said with a shrug. ``I just work here.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was precisely the problem in October: work. All men who
throw knuckleballs are used to the work. Lots of it. There are only
two knuckleballers in the Hall of Fame (Phil Niekro and Hoyt
Wilhelm). Niekro pitched until he was 48, threw more than 5,400
innings and had 19 seasons in which he lasted 200 innings or more.
So, no, you can't call these guys slackers. But they are certainly
among the most misunderstood athletes in sports.
</P>
<P>
   They grip baseballs with finely manicured fingernails. They
deliver the ball so slowly and smoothly that they look like
synchronized swimmers in their follow-throughs. They can pitch on
five days' rest, four days' rest or two days' rest. They can save a
tired staff. Unfortunately for them, they also happen to be the
masters of the most underrated pitching category: innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   Wins are supreme and strikeouts are sexy, but 200-plus-inning
guys are necessary. You know what 200-inning guys are? The
fullbacks of baseball. You don't realize how important they are
until you don't have one.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have already acknowledged the importance of Wakefield.
He is expected to be part of the rotation this year. Exclusively.
The Martinez brothers will lead the rotation, followed either by
Wakefield or Jeff Fassero. Wakefield said staying in a starter's
routine will be more pleasant than flopping between the bullpen and
rotation. He will also be helped by Niekro, who is expected to come
to City of Palms Park next week and be his tutor.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be the first time that has happened. In 1995, his first
season with the Sox, Wakefield would phone the Hall of Famer for
Knuckler Pointers. Phil and Joe Niekro also worked with Wakefield
after he was released by the Pirates. Phil Niekro briefly worked
with him in '98, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to (Phil) over the winter and saw him at his
brother's golf tournament,'' Wakefield said. ``I called him once.
He was a very busy person'' because of shows and appearances. It's
clear Wakefield is anticipating a nice knucklers' retreat when
Niekro arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he was talking about goals of 15-20 wins and 200-plus
innings. A lot of pitchers can't mention that number of innings so
casually, he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``But 20 years ago, guys threw 300 innings and it was no big
deal,'' he said. Later, he joked that his goal was to have 30
starts and 30 relief appearances in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   (Aren't you glad that we are even discussing baseball at this
point? I am thrilled to be here and, I promise, the 83-degree
temperature _ mostly sunny, 5 percent chance of rain _ only has a
little to do with it.)
</P>
<P>
   Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan bounced from pitcher to pitcher
and hitter to hitter Tuesday. He saw Williams's son, Brady, talking
with a few other players and shouted, ``You guys hitting?''
</P>
<P>
   Before they could answer, Kerrigan volunteered, ``I'll throw to
you.'' So they dragged out a batting cage and went to work.
Kerrigan watched young pitchers throw. He long-tossed with Brian
Rose and was so impressed with one pitch that he paused, shook his
head and said, ``Now that's beautiful.'' Eventually, he moved on to
Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   They were in the field together for a long while. Wakefield said
there was no ``clearing of the air'' over the October incident, but
you got the feeling something was said. By the end of the day,
things were back to normal. Someone asked Wakefield if he could
throw nine innings right now, on the spot. He smiled and said,
``Sure could.''

WORKING AT MARRIAGE . . . WITH CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, Mom and Dad, how was your Valentine's Day?
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 18-month-old twins, the last thing I wanted to do was
light candles and break out the china,'' says Megan Dupes of
Plymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance is at the bottom of the heap,'' says Barbara
Lynn-Davis of Cambridge, Mass., whose daughter just turned 1.
</P>
<P>
   That probably sums it up for most couples who are also parents.
Who has the time for romance? Who has the energy?
</P>
<P>
   Just because we are busy married people with children, however,
does not mean we are doomed to a romance-free marriage that grows
more distant or eventually fails. While studies show that having
children speeds the decline of marital satisfaction, it's not as if
not having children keeps a marriage alive: On average, all
relationships deteriorate over time.
</P>
<P>
   But there are 10 to 15 percent of parents who report an increase
in satisfaction in all aspects of their marriage after their
children arrive, says psychologist Kristin Lindahl of the
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, what do we have to do to be among them?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, these are partners who know better than to hope
that having a baby will salvage a bad marriage, says Lindahl. To
the contrary, these couples already have a strong marriage. They
face parenthood with realistic expectations, including knowing
their relationship will continue to change throughout the active
parenting years; function as a team and support each other; and
place a priority on working on their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It's this last piece that gets most couples in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking time for each other is probably the most important
thing you can do,'' says researcher Pam Jordan, a nurse and
associate professor at the University of Washington in Seattle who
counsels couples as they become parents.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, putting marriage before children is not part of
the American culture. ``It feels selfish,'' she says. Parents
typically tell her, ``How can we get a sitter when we've both been
working all week and the kids have been in day care and we haven't
had any quality time as a family?''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's answer is that time spent focused on each other is time
invested in your children. ``It's your relationship together that
creates a context for the family,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   There is such a high correlation between the quality of the
parents' relationship and children's well-being that researcher
Carolyn Pape Cowan can predict how young children will do in school
by looking at their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couples who take time to nurture each other are more able to
nurture their children. Couples who nurture each other also have
children who are less preoccupied with worry about family
dynamics,'' says Cowan. She and her husband, Philip, are in the
vanguard of research on how marriages thrive after parenthood and
have followed more than 200 couples for eight years, since the
birth of their first child. They are co-authors of ``When Partners
Become Parents,'' revised edition (Erlbaum), and co-directors of
Becoming a Parent Project at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the strain parenthood puts on partners doesn't
disappear once a baby sleeps through the night, or starts to talk,
or uses the potty. Pass one hurdle and new ones appear: which day
care, which preschool, what bedtime, what sport?
</P>
<P>
   How you cope with each new issue depends, to a large extent, on
the history partners have for dealing with conflict, says Jay
Belsky, who is also known for his research on the transition to
parenthood. He says couples whose marriage remains strong tend to
have:
</P>
<P>
   --Realistic expectations. ``In the old days, the wife expected
to do everything, and she did,'' he says. ``Today, she expects her
partner to do more, but she hasn't relinquished control
proportionate to her expectation.'' At the same time, Father is
happy to no longer have the pressure to always know best, but still
frequently wants to be able to exert that authority. ``Both sides
have given up territory,'' says Belsky, but they haven't
necessarily figured out how to work within the new landscape.
Resentment and anger build not only because there are different
expectations, but because the expectations don't get verbalized. In
the most typical scenario, it's the wife who feels put upon. ``She
thought they would be sharing equally,'' says Cowan. ``Most couples
can't and don't.''
</P>
<P>
   --A division of labor that feels equitable, even if it doesn't
look that way. Alan Dupes, for instance, doesn't pull much of his
share during the week: He works full time and goes to school three
nights. But he tries hard to take the twins on an evening or on
Saturday morning so Megan has time to herself. That may not seem
like much of a trade-off, but it means a lot to Megan, who handles
her frustrations by making sure she has emotional support (she's
active in the parenting programs at nearby Jordan Hospital, where
Alan has also attended dads' classes) and by telling herself he
won't be in school forever. ``We're a team,'' she says, ``and this
happens to be what we need to do right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That would draw kudos from Jordan. ``If you don't think of
yourselves as a team, it's a setup for blaming your partner for
things not being the way you want them to be,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   --Rose-colored glasses. ``Imagine you're the wife,'' says
Belsky. ``Your husband lets you sleep in, but you awake to discover
he dressed the baby in the same chocolate-stained top she wore
yesterday. You can say, `She can't wear that top, it's filthy!' or,
`Thank goodness she's dressed.' '' The difference, he says, is
between having a partner and a helper, between sharing and
micromanaging. To Belsky, this is the single most important trait a
couple can have. Megan Dupes agrees. ``Since Day 1, my theory has
been that whatever my husband does, it isn't wrong, it's just
different,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when these differences can be huge, of course,
because men and women look at parenting at least partly based on
the role models they were raised with.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a man looks at what he's doing, he's comparing himself to
his father, who didn't do anything with the kids,'' says Belsky.
``He's saying to himself, `Wow, what a great dad I am!' '' The
mother, meanwhile, is comparing what he does to what she does and
concluding, ``You don't do anything around here!''
</P>
<P>
   If couples could freeze-frame the moment and talk _ What made
you say that? What were you thinking? _ they might better
understand each other's perspective and defuse tension. Often,
that's all you need to do, says Belsky. He is the author of ``The
Transition to Parenthood'' (Delacourt) and a professor at
Pennsylvania State University, on leave at Birkbeck College in
London.
</P>
<P>
   As simplistic as it sounds, making time to talk is the antidote
every researcher recommends, beginning with the birth of the first
baby and never letting up.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan recommends formal, weekly dates. ``The idea is to not
lose touch as friends,'' she says. Otherwise, says Cowan, ``You
find yourselves on opposite sides of an issue with no idea of how
you got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because you make time to communicate doesn't mean it always
has to be heavy-duty or nonbaby conversation. Barbara Lynn-Davis
says that more often than not these days, she and husband Michael
Davis relate to each other through the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Alan and Megan Dupes haven't left the house as a couple in four
months, but they do have dinner alone four nights a week. Although
they purposefully set this up as a time to talk and reconnect,
they're often too exhausted even for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll eat in front of the TV,'' says Alan. ``But even that's
nice. Just to sit and be peaceful together.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Talk on the phone from work, send e-mail, find other small
gestures to express your love. Researcher Pam Jordan's favorite
anecdote is of a woman who would pack her husband's lunch each day,
then take a bite out of his sandwich. ``It was her way of saying,
`I'm with you even though I'm not with you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   --Don't wait for your partner to do something extraordinary to
praise him or her. Find something kind and supportive to say each
day.
</P>
<P>
   --A good way to get time together, especially an overnight, is
to trade babysitting with a neighbor or friend.
</P>
<P>
   --It's not unusual for many months to go by before some couples
resume sex after a baby is born. That typically doesn't create
lasting damage as long as you find other ways to be close, like
hugging and snuggling, and sharing how you feel emotionally,
researchers say.
</P>

WE BELIEVE IN MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our family's just wild about Harry. Potter, that is.
</P>
<P>
   I spend an afternoon a week with each of my grandchildren.
Jessie, 8, and I are in the middle of building a dollhouse while
Danny, 5, and I are exploding volcanoes, but after a while we set
aside our projects and head upstairs to curl up on my bed and enter
Harry Potter's world together.
</P>
<P>
   All of J. K. Rowling's books about the magic in our midst are on
the bestseller list. Is there anyone who hasn't heard about the
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Harry and his
friends study charms and spells while fighting off the evil forces
around them? The appeal of these books has been spread far and wide
by word of mouth, but the words out of my mouth are spoken aloud.
</P>
<P>
   These books are better shared than savored alone.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie and I are working on vocabulary, although she doesn't
know it. The story's so engrossing that she doesn't want to miss a
single nuance. Professor Binns, who teaches History of Magic, bores
his students into a ``stupor.'' Jessie wants to know what that is,
the difference between ``mortal danger'' and ``peril,'' and what it
means when Uncle Vernon shows no signs of ``relenting.'' Rowling's
vocabulary is challenging; ``valiant,'' ``demonic,'' ``artifacts,''
``slouched,'' ``torpor,'' ``spawn,'' ``jaunty,'' and ``dumbstruck''
all show up before Page 40, but these thrilling words not only
enhance Harry's adventures, but increase our pleasure in them. It's
as if Rowling has dipped her language in a tincture of magic. Each
meaning I disclose to Jessie adds to its enchantment.
</P>
<P>
   I simplify for Danny, skipping or switching to an easier
vocabulary. He'll hear them in context when his family listens to
the books on tape. Danny's interested in motivation, which often
baffles him. Why would Uncle Vernon, saddled with an unwanted
nephew for the summer, get meaner when he found out Harry wasn't
allowed to use magic outside school? Why would anyone think
children from old wizard families were better than those born to
Muggles, or ordinary folk? Danny wants to know why the kids try to
solve their own problems instead of going to adults for help. The
story can be dark and disturbing. He needs to be reassured
frequently that good will triumph over bad.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of Rowling's success is that she's dealing with real
life. Gussied up in outlandish costumes, it's still recognizable.
What does it do to some people when they have power over you? What
is snobbery all about? Why are people mean? Jessie and I are racing
through while Danny and I move more slowly. He wants to figure out
why Harry's friend Ron is ashamed of being poor and why Harry
hasn't given him some of the gold he's inherited from his parents.
As Danny comes to understand Harry's world, he's making sense of
his own. He's solving mysteries other than those of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, reading together isn't only preparing Jessie for the
verbal part of the SATs, or helping Danny come to grips with the
complex and scary world of the 21st century. We laugh a lot. And
we're starting to notice more and more magic in our world.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Danny showed up one afternoon with a lasso tied to
his belt. Why? He had no idea, but the chapter we read that day had
to do with Harry and his friend Ron having to de-gnome a garden, a
task similar to weeding. The technique involved catching the gnomes
and swinging them by their feet in great circles ``like a lasso,''
until they were too dizzy to find their way back to their
gnomeholes. Danny and I agreed it was no coincidence that he was
prepared to practice swinging imaginary gnomes in my living room.
Magic was clearly at work.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie and her mom, meanwhile, visited an antique dollhouse shop
in search of furniture. The old woman behind the counter sniffed
that Jessie was much too young to touch a single object in her
shop, but when Jessie turned on her charm, the old crone suddenly
smiled, shuffled into the back room, and located a small box of
dollhouse treasures she actually gave Jessie as a gift, including
three miniature books, one crystal goblet, and an ice cream cone on
a china plate. Surely, this was a witch who recognized a kindred
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``All kinds of strange things are happening to us these days,''
I confided to Jessie the other day. ``Our family may not be Muggles
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessie gave me a look halfway between faith and skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   She almost believes.

KEEPING VANDALS OUT OF YOUR PC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The message on the computer at my church wouldn't have meant
much to the ladies in the next room sorting canned goods for the
weekly food giveaway. But to me, it was like stumbling across a
serpent in a garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system's silent NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) Internet Server
is actively advertising its existence across the Internet and thus
inviting equally silent connection and intrusion into your
system,'' the message read.
</P>
<P>
   A fancy way of saying ``Busted!''
</P>
<P>
   I'd just used Shields Up, a fascinating free Internet service
run by programmer Steve Gibson that tests the security of
Internet-connected computers like the one at my church.
</P>
<P>
   I'd visited Shields Up at grc.com. A few seconds later, I got
the worrisome results. There on the screen was my name and the name
of the church's internal computer network, both available to any
cunning scavenger on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, our church computer is connected to the Internet
through a high-speed DSL line that can remain connected around the
clock, and thus constantly exposed to computer vandals. Good thing
I'm in the habit of switching it off when it's unattended.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, some cracker might have tried a bit of nastiness,
like installing a ``denial-of-service'' program and using it to
attack some other Web site. That's the trick used by the vandals
who made front-page news last week.
</P>
<P>
   So far, their planted programs have been found in the computers
of some major universities, rather than at Baptist churches. But as
millions of us start using DSL and cable modem connections to the
Internet _ leving our machines powered up and dialed in all the
time _ we too will become targets.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. makes it all too easy. The Windows 95 and 98
operating systems found on most home computers have a feature
called NetBIOS that's designed to let several machines at the same
location talk to each other. The trouble is that once you log onto
the Internet, NetBIOS exposes the contents of your computer to a
world of nosy people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the other major operating systems, like Unix, Linux, and
Apple Computer Inc.'s Mac OS, have flaws of their own. None of the
popular operating systems are ``hardened'' _ designed from top to
bottom to be extremely difficult to subvert. Hardened systems are
harder to use. So faced with this choice, software makers generally
opt for simplicity over security.
</P>
<P>
   The security holes can be plugged, though, with a piece of
software called a firewall. All the communications between your
computer and the Net travel through software settings called ports.
Each port has a number, and there are over 65,000 of them. But the
standard Internet services almost always use the same ports. Web
pages come through over port 80, for instance, while Usenet
bulletin board messages use port 119. A firewall basically opens
the ports for permissible types of data, like Web pages, and closes
the others.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, a gross oversimplification. Many a thick
book has been written on the finer points of firewall
configuration. Besides, a firewall won't do any good if someone has
already loaded a hostile Internet program on your computer, using
it to hammer some other server on the Net. Firewalls target bad
data coming in, not going out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a start. And there are some reasonably simple and
cheap firewalls for amateurs. The antivirus company Symantec Inc.
offers Norton Internet Security 2000, a $60 Windows program that
throws in antivirus protection and privacy defenses, such as cookie
blocking. Not only does it block the usual ports, but it can also
be used to detect programs on your machine that are making
unauthorized attempts to send data over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Zone Labs Inc.'s ZoneAlarm does the same, and it's downright
ruthless about it. The software is available at www.zonelabs.com.
The first time you run it, ZoneAlarm won't even let your browser
access the Web without permission. And yet ZoneAlarm is fairly
simple to use and has the advantage of being free for home and
nonprofit users.
</P>
<P>
   Just the thing to protect an innocent Baptist computer from the
wickedness of the Internet.

FINALLY, AN ORGANIZER WORTH FLIPPING OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before you purchase a 3Com Palm organizer, take a good look at
the Handspring Visor.
</P>
<P>
   The Visor personal organizer is a Palm clone, running the same
operating system as 3Com's esteemed palmtop computers.
Interestingly enough, the Visor was created by the same team that
invented the original Palm organizer _ Jeff Hawkins, Donna
Dubinsky, and Ed Colligan _ and who then sold their company to USR
Robotics (which was eventually bought by 3Com).
</P>
<P>
   According to Handspring's marketing materials, the Visor is
supposed to be true to the Palm tradition by being small, simple,
affordable, and connected. It does a better job at being true to
the Palm than the latest additions to the Palm family that 3Com is
hawking.
</P>
<P>
   The Visor has been on sale for several months, but the device
has only been available directly from Handspring's Web site
(www.handspring.com). Although Handspring said that I could expect
to wait between four and six weeks for the unit to arrive, the
top-of-the-line Visor I ordered came in less than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the Palm, the advantages of the Visor are speed,
memory, and price. The Visor uses a USB interface to synchronize
with your desktop computer, making the ``hot sync'' process roughly
five times faster than with the Palm. The basic Visor with 2MB of
RAM and a USB cradle costs $179. The Deluxe Visor comes with 8MB of
RAM and costs $249; this unit is also available in five colors:
graphite, orange, blue, green, and ice.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, 3Com's Palm IIIx comes with 4MB of RAM and costs
$299; the sleek Palm V organizer comes with just 2MB of RAM and
costs between $319 and $399; the Vx comes with 8MB of RAM but costs
as much as $499.
</P>
<P>
   The Visor comes with an improved version of the Palm's datebook
application and a nifty world clock application, as well as an
updated version of the Palm Desktop version 3.0. There's also a
microphone, although precious little software actually uses it.
</P>
<P>
   The Visor comes with a slot on the back that's supposed to make
expansion a snap. You can slide in more memory to either expand the
computer or give yourself a backup. But Handspring claims that
other cards will be available soon, with everything on them from
MP3 players to Global Positioning System receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Innogear has already announced a device called a
``SixPack'' that will include an analog modem, a cellular modem,
8MB of flash RAM, a vibrating alarm, a loud beeper, and a flashing
red light. The SixPack is the perfect device for communicating,
alerting, and backing up. Find out more at www.innogear.com/6.htm.
</P>
<P>
   But the most distinctive feature of the Visor is its case.
Picking up on the iMac fashion, the Visor and its cradle are
manufactured from colorful, semitranslucent polycarbonate. The case
is quite attractive. It's also quite strong. Although you can get a
wide assortment of leather cases for the Visor, my preferred case
is the polycarbonate shield that snaps in front, over the device's
fragile screen. It surely couldn't stop a bullet, but it feels like
it could easily stave off a few sudden impacts. My only regret is
that the shield is somewhat difficult to attach and detach. Another
problem: you can't synchronize the Visor with the shield in place.
</P>
<P>
   I was never a big fan of the original Palm until earlier this
year, when I started planning a tour to promote my new book. Each
day of my tour was scheduled by my California-based publisher. At
first we tried to make everything work by sending e-mail back and
forth. It was difficult: I could never make an appointment, for
fear that my publicist had already scheduled that slot. A few weeks
before the tour commenced, I decided to switch to Yahoo Calendar. I
simply set up a special account for the project and gave my
publicist the password. Because we were both using the same
calendar, we never double-booked.
</P>
<P>
   The week before the tour, I downloaded Yahoo's TrueSync software
so that I could synchronize the Palm with the Web-based calendar.
As a result, the rest of the tour went off like a charm: every
morning I would simply dial up my Internet service provider and
synchronize the Palm with Yahoo. A few minutes later, I would have
a detailed list of everywhere I was supposed to be during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Much to my surprise, switching from the Palm to the Visor was
reasonably painless. I simply synchronized the 3Com organizer,
installed the Visor software over the Palm software on a desktop
computer, and then synchronized the Visor. All of my appointments,
phone numbers, and other information transferred automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Besides trying to attract users, Handspring is doing a good job
courting developers as well. Developers are being encouraged to
sign up for the company's special programs, many of them free. And
unlike 3Com, Handspring is distributing free tools from Cygnus
Solutions for developing PalmOS applications. Although these tools
are available for the 3Com Palm as well, it's nice to see that
Handspring is pushing free developer tools, rather than the more
expensive tools that are the norm on the 3Com platform.
</P>
<P>
   Although I didn't like the Visor at first _ I preferred the Palm
III's flip-up cover to the Visor's removable shield _ I have grown
increasingly attached to the machine. It's substantially more
powerful than a 3Com Palm that costs nearly twice the price. It
synchronizes faster and I have a green one. What more could a busy
guy want?

   What's this? A brand new subcompact in an age of behemoths. A
stingy sucker of fuel in a time of massive swilling? A small
four-seater in a day when if you're not hauling eight or nine
people, you're just not in the flow?
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   They call it the Echo _ as in Echo Boomers, the children of Baby
Boomers _ and Toyota has this car aimed squarely at them. When
Toyota killed the Tercel a couple of years back, some wondered if
the car maker would be out of the subcompact arena. Since then,
Toyota obviously realized that as its Camry generation aged and
remained loyal, they'd need a subcompact to haul in younger
loyalists. This is it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wedge of a car that looks much like the Prius, the
soon-to-the-market electric/gasoline hybrid. Like the Prius, it's
got economy and environment written all over it. They should paint
them all one color: green.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, it is remarkable to see the cab-forward design
so common to big Chryslers featured in a subcompact. There's a
reason for this (more on that later). Its hood slopes up steeply as
the lines carry very high over the roof and drop down to a high,
chopped trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Climb inside, and the first thing you notice is the instrument
cluster: a crushed oval, slanted toward the driver, at center dash.
It's a simple, elegant little thing holding the speedometer, gas
gauge, and a ring of warning lights. The gauges are black-on-white
and wonderfully retro _ think Porsche or Chrysler 300M.
</P>
<P>
   The legroom up front is deceptively good, given that the dash
seems to rise straight up from the floor. There is surprising
legroom in the rear, as well, for the two passengers it holds back
there.
</P>
<P>
   The seats look low and flat as you gaze at them through an open
door, but when you climb into the driver's seat, you feel as if
you're sitting high, almost like in a van. This is where that
cab-forward treatment adds to the feel; you have to rise a bit to
even see the hood, giving that snub-nosed van aura.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to it is remarkable headroom _ think Ford Focus _ that
continues all the way back.
</P>
<P>
   You're dealing with an inexpensive car here, so don't expect
automatic windows. And in the two-door model tested, even the door
locks were manual, baffling my young friend and
mornings-to-the-school-bus passenger Diane Romano, all of 12, who
had to be shown that in some cars, you need to pull up the lock, as
opposed to clicking an automatic button.
</P>
<P>
   The seats were flat, firm, and wide enough to be supportive and
comfortable. The 60/40 split rear seat folds and gives entry to the
trunk, which is virtually cavernous for a subcompact car.
</P>
<P>
   It's powered by a 1.5-liter, DOHC, 16-valve, 4-cylinder engine _
all aluminum with steel liners _ that delivers 108 horsepower, 15
more than the old Tercel. Going green, it gave me just over 36
miles per gallon in a mix of highway, city, and country driving.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed manual transmission was tight and smooth, and the
engine, small as it is, handled upshifts with grace.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension has struts and an antiroll bar up front, with a
torsion beam axle at the rear. This is not an advanced system, but
we're looking to save some money here. You'd expect a car with this
setup and a high roofline to give you body roll when cornering at
speed, and that's what you get. But this was not meant to be a
sports car, not designed to be blasting through turns or weaving in
and out of traffic at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   It is meant to be reliable, comfortable, and utilitarian. The
Echo is all of these.
</P>
<P>
   It was remarkably smooth on my pitted country road, took frost
heaves with noticeable thumping sounds but no real jolts inside,
and moved in and out of highway traffic at good commuter speed.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the middle of what was a very windy week, it held its
own against the icy blasts thrown at it, keeping on line when you'd
expect a car this size to get tossed about some.
</P>
<P>
   It's got disc brakes up front, drums in the rear, and they are
plenty to bring this lightweight to easy stops. Antilock brakes are
an option, and I'd go with them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with a base price of $9,995, there are a lot of options
worth looking at (and I'm not sure you'll find one Echo out there
offered at $9,995). Good marketing starting point, but probably not
rooted in reality.
</P>
<P>
   The two-door I tested had among its options power steering, air
conditioning, an upgraded sound system, a sports package, an
all-weather package with heavy-duty battery, and intermittent
windshield wipers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these options you'd want anyway, which means you're up
over $12,000 _ still cheap in a day when $30,000 cars are
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   This car will compete with the Chevrolet Metro, Hyundai Accent,
and other subcompacts. But if you like comparison shopping, I'd run
this against the Ford Focus and then make my decision.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The porthole air vents at the sides and center of the dash.
Rotate them in any direction and you change air flow. Simple and
easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The front door on the two-door is a bit narrow so it's not as
easy as it should be getting into the front seat and downright
tricky getting into the rear.

FOR CAR SELLERS, IT'S SHOOTOUT TIME IN DOT.COM CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The inquiries come in an inexorable flow over the electronic
transoms of fax and e-mail. They are not about ABS, SUVs,
transmissions, tires, engines, nuts, bolts, child restraint seats,
or road rage.
</P>
<P>
   They are each, instead, the same question from some PR person
somewhere: Wouldn't you like to write a story about some new auto
Web site (kicktires.com, bounceonseats.com, snakeoil.com,
feelyoungagain.com, buycars.com)? They are so numerous I feel like
an armadillo on a Texas highway filled with roaring, 10-wheeled
dot-coms. I scuttle out of the way and let the traffic pass.
</P>
<P>
   It's shootout time in Dot-Com City, and customers, automobile
manufacturers, and dealers are either targets or caught in the
crossfire. It is the dealers feeling the heat the most right now.
They've got to have individual dot-com capabilities but they fear
what widespread dot-com trade could do to their business.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from this year's annual convention of the National Auto
Dealers Association indicate that, for the second year in a row,
dot-com business was the talk of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintive wail from dealers: Don't let us get dot-commed by
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Your local auto dealership is a tangible Web site that you visit
in person. You browse. Click onto a car by kicking the tires. Open
a window by pulling on a door handle and climbing inside. For FAQs,
turn to a salesman. If you like the answers, you click on OK. If
you don't, you are the curser. It has long been thus.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   And that has dealers trembling. There are now third parties,
many with virtually no retail auto sales experience, trying to get
into the business of selling cars directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   You would think that NADA, with nearly 20,000 new car and truck
dealers holding 40,000 separate franchises, would have met the
challenge head-on and immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a lag. First, they had to fight off a potential
threat from another flank _ the manufacturers, who as of last
year's convention were still threatening to take their cars to
consumers directly over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That threat arose even as dealerships were setting up their own
Web sites showing inventory, financing plans, prices for parts,
service specials, and other offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers, meanwhile, were giving potential consumers such
information as suggested retail price, options, vehicle specs, and
consumer advice.
</P>
<P>
   Some independent sites, operating with dealer cooperation,
became ``brokers'' for dealers who cooperated with them.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, consumer service sites _ such as Kelley Blue
Book _ made it possible for potential buyers to walk onto any
showroom better informed than ever and ready to move on at click
speed if they didn't like what they heard.
</P>
<P>
   It all had to make dealers nervous.
</P>
<P>
   They got some relief: Several states passed laws protecting
franchised dealers. And by the time this year's NADA convention
rolled around, big automakers such as GM and Ford were vowing to
stand by their dealers and not sell cars directly to consumers on
line nor to sell franchises to Web site operators. How long the
latter can last, I'm not sure.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, according to the Automotive News, many potential
e-dealers and many millions of dollars were in play at this year's
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the threat, the magazine posed, of a computer
billionaire buying up dealerships across the country and using his
own electronic engine to drive sales, ``selling vehicles nationwide
via flatbed truck.''
</P>
<P>
   It could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of convention participant Brain Stafford who
came to town representing Trilogy Inc., a Texas software provider
that already has jumped into appliances, employee recruitment, and
gift registration.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford has no auto retailing experience, Automotive News said,
but he did arrive ready for a shootout: He had $100 million stuffed
into his holsters, looking to corral automobile franchises, mostly
of the small, rural (read inexpensive) herd.
</P>
<P>
   This would provide a platform for sales that would at least
mimic manufacturer-to-dealer-to-customer.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how long the manufacturers' promises to not let the
franchises be sold to these dot-com providers would hold up in
court.
</P>
<P>
   After all, once the practice of established franchises selling
directly over the Internet has become commonplace _ and it is
happening already _ how can it be possible to keep out legitimate
business people who want to buy into the action and do the same
thing?
</P>
<P>
   Would it be fair to tell franchise holders that they cannot sell
the businesses they have bought and built to someone who will
operate them in many similar ways?
</P>
<P>
   And, once the ball is rolling, how long will manufacturers be
able to stick to a vow of no direct Internet sales as they watch
third parties doing what they could be doing themselves?
</P>
<P>
   It's a scary time for dealerships, no doubt. But it is not a
time for anybody to even blink, let alone bury their heads in the
sand.
</P>
<P>
   The dot-com shootout is under way and dealerships and
manufacturers, if they want to continue to be players, need to play
with their strengths.
</P>
<P>
   I see a parallel here with my business, newspapers. Information
is the foundation of this business. No matter how it gets
delivered, folks who can gather, organize, and cogently present
information are valuable. That's why combinations of print media
and Internet sites are valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Now look at auto dealerships _ the bricks, glass, repair shops,
showroom floors _ as the foundation of that business. True, the
manufacturers roll out the product, but once it leaves their hands,
it is doubtful that, even in a high-tech future, many people will
buy new models of autos based only on photos. They're still going
to want to at least go kick the tires _ even if they return home
and do the purchase on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the manufacturers are still going to need places that
will service and repair the products they sell.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no reason, even though it means monumental change,
that dealerships can't remain players in all these areas.

RETELLING OF CINDERELLA STORY TANTALIZES THE IMAGINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GLORIA MAZURE  
 c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hobbling home under a mackerel sky, I came upon a group of
children. They were tossing their toys in the air by turns telling
a story and acting it too.''
</P>
<P>
   The passerby, an old woman, pauses to rest, unnoticed by the
youngsters, and hears a play about a pretty girl _ scorned by her
two plain stepsisters _ who goes to a ball and meets a prince who
adores and romances her.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story that resembles her own. ``I can peer at it as if
at a painting, through the rheumy apparatus of the mind. ...''
</P>
<P>
   As the aged lady continues to listen, she is carried back on the
tale's threads to a corner of her memory. There, her own family
tale begins _ in a time without the magic of pumpkins and glass
slippers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus opens ``Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister'' (Regan Books,
368 pages, $24), a new book by Gregory Maguire that offers a
retelling of the Cinderella story.
</P>
<P>
   The tale, set against a backdrop of Holland in the 17th century,
is one of deception, beauty, enchantment and luck as an
impoverished widow and her two daughters are taken in by a Flemish
painter.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire quickly serves up a helping of adventures mixed with
fanciful situations and wry observations. ``In fairy tales, rats
turn into human beings. In reality,'' the author observes, ``it's
far more common for human beings to turn into rats.''
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a journey, tempest tossed on the shores of
imagined history, in which the reader bobs along in the wake of the
unexpected. The story's path, strewn with divergent whimsy, is
dappled throughout by a contrast of opposites. Calm becomes stormy,
plagues replace placid times, fabulous balls transform bad times.
We are drawn to anticipate one thing, and another comes to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The tale opens upon a weary trio _ Margarethe and her daughters,
Iris and Ruth _ as they arrive in a small town in the Netherlands
after escaping trouble in England. Their hopes of finding rescue
with a relative are quickly dashed and the abandoned trio turns to
village residents for help.
</P>
<P>
   They face slammed shutters and unhearing ears until the village
artist, Master Schoonmaker, offers them lodging in exchange for
errands and housekeeping. Among the artist's penchants are
recording the religious dictates of the times and portraits of the
wealthy, and documenting ``the gallery of God's mistakes.'' He also
does his part in sheltering and helping lost souls.
</P>
<P>
   After a time, Iris poses for the artist and gains, through an
artist's eye, new views on life. As the reader is drawn along, Iris
learns much about herself, art's hidden values and life's unwritten
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The story's scenes are all painted with a tincture of the times
_ settings, social structures, ways of life _ even the philosophies
of the day. We become privy to the ways and needs of the locale and
its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   An engaging array of people is depicted in bright, lively
descriptions, including those with shriveled arms, or humped backs,
or elderly moving like a ``splay-leg bug skittering over the
surface of a pond.'' This is a book for lovers of words.
</P>
<P>
   And also for lovers of high spirits. A wonderful tangle of human
foibles and weaknesses is wound in with the strengths and wonders
of the characters we meet.
</P>
<P>
   Fate swirls its cape over the story's vivid landscape of events.
When the town roads ice over, all the residents turn out _ boys and
men playing games, skaters twirling, oldsters falling, fieldmen
fishing. ``As far as the eye can see along the curve of the river,
tiny pegs of people, in black and gray and red.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the festivities, Iris greets an old woman she has dubbed
the Queen of the Hairy-Chinned Gypsies, who appears throughout the
book to sprinkle about her oblique wisdom. Iris teases the old
woman about her blustery fierceness and the idleness of the threats
she makes. In the book's cryptic mix of humor and counsel, the old
crone off handedly retorts, ``It's your job to change yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fate also changes lives. Iris uses her ability to speak English
and Dutch to befriend and tutor a merchant's beautiful daughter,
Clara. Later, through a tumbling of time, Clara becomes Iris'
stepsister.
</P>
<P>
   Margarethe sums up her change in social situation in becoming
betrothed to the well-off father of Clara as knowing ``when to
jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Maguire has a wonderful knack of turning the tables on
well-known fables _ and shifting our comfortably seated
expectations. He managed a similar sleight of mind two years ago in
his debut novel, ``Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch
of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Maguire beckons readers to leave the familiar niche of fancy and
fantasy and enter his realm of reality, where events alive with
village ways and new vantage points blend with history, religion
and, in this story, an artist's brush mirroring the human state.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of skimming the surface of a story to yield a bare-bones
philosophy, readers must look deeper into the times, traveling
through layers and a larger bite of history, its causes and
controversies. Nestling the stories in their era's events adds a
sense of reality and dimension to the characters, making it
possible to ponder the past as well as the characters' travails.
</P>
<P>
   But where does the familiar Cinderella story come in? During a
time of economic catastrophe, preparations for a grand ball
surround a visit by the famed, though aging, Marie de Medici. She
is coming to town to sit for a portrait and, perhaps, to procure a
bride for her nephew.
</P>
<P>
   The stirrings of the village gossip mill reach even the
beautiful Clara, always reclusive, who has taken refuge in the
kitchen as she grows up, finding comfort among the cinders. Iris
urges her stepsister, Clara, to venture out to the ball. When Clara
says she is not ready to be seen, Iris counters, ``Like me, you are
ready to look.''
</P>
<P>
   And, from there, the rest of the story is just a coach ride
away.

THE ECHO _ A SOUND CAR FOR A NEW GENERATION

   What's this? A brand new subcompact in an age of behemoths. A
stingy sucker of fuel in a time of massive swilling? A small
four-seater in a day when if you're not hauling eight or nine
people, you're just not in the flow?

 &HT;    CENSUS GOING ALL-OUT TO PROMOTE PARTICIPATION
 &HT;    920&AMP;add. For release Sunday, Feb. 20.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ How do you get millions of Americans to do
something they are not inclined to do?
</P>
<P>
   Begin with an advertising blitz, including precious TV air time
during the Super Bowl. Then call on the help of an even higher
authority, the kind who wear priestly robes and preach fire and
brimstone.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the U.S. Census Bureau wants all the help it can get,
even prayers.
</P>
<P>
   From the neighborhood church pulpit to network prime time,
chances are good that over the next month you are going to hear
about the importance of responding to the Census 2000
questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   This year's once-a-decade tally is the most complex and costly
ever. The bureau will spend $4.5 billion as it seeks to count some
275 million citizens and millions of undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high: Census data are used to determine how
congressional seats are apportioned and how billions of dollars in
federal money are distributed among the states.
</P>
<P>
   The count has become more difficult in rapidly changing America,
with a booming immigrant population unfamiliar with the census and
traditionally mistrustful of government. There's also a large
segment of middle America too busy and too easily distracted, who
are likely to allow their census forms to languish among the junk
mail before they get around to filling them out.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Census Bureau is using paid advertising
to get the message out after a disturbing drop in the mail-in
response rate. Only 65 percent of households responded in 1990 down
from 75 percent in 1980 and 78 percent in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is on to avoid a repeat of 1990, when an estimated
8.4 million people were missed, most of them minorities and
children. That cost some states additional congressional seats and
badly needed money for school, roads, parks and other social
services.
</P>
<P>
   Targeted, multi-lingual ads, aimed mainly at minorities who are
less likely to fill out the form, began airing last fall. The
prime-time push to reach them and a broader TV and radio audience
begins later this month. By March, the agency will become the
nation's third largest advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   Among the spots: a teacher conducts her class from a broom
closet, the result of undercounted children and thus the lack of
new and needed classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be able to get away from us,'' said Terry Dukes,
executive vice president of the ad giant Young &AMP; Rubicam, which is
managing the $167 million campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Census also is relying on the volunteered services of
clergy, schools, politicians, civic leaders, professional athletes
and others to spread the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a profoundly important issue. If we want to make good
decisions about where we're going, we first have to know exactly
who we are,'' President Clinton said from the White House last week
during an orchestrated Census event.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Patrick Flores of Texas, a leading spokesman for
Hispanic Catholics, will dedicate Mass on Sunday (Feb. 20) in San
Antonio to the census, a service broadcast weekly to some 8 million
Spanish-speaking viewers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Census Director Kenneth Prewitt will attend the service, and
address brief remarks to the two central themes: The count is
important to deliver tax dollars to your neighborhood, and
confidentiality is assured _ in other words, the Census Bureau will
not be sharing your identity with any other government agency.
</P>
<P>
   As the bedrock of community life, particularly in black and
Hispanic neighborhoods, churches across America will help deliver
the message. The Census Bureau has even provided ministers, priests
and rabbis with suggested announcements _ essentially talking
points from the pulpit _ on how to remind parishioners in March and
April of the need to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's join together in this important effort,'' the Census
Bureau recommends that the clergy tell their congregations on
Sunday, March 26. ``And make sure our community is represented in
the census.''
</P>
<P>
   The census has used churches, schools and community centers in
the past to promote its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Census in the Schools'' programs will reach some 1 million
classrooms in an effort to enlist children, particularly those in
immigrant and low-income families, to convince their parents to
fill out and return their Census forms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, other paid advertising and promotions are coming
from a variety of special-interest and minority groups with a stake
in seeing a better count.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of messages from myriad sources has the ad
professionals fretting that the result could be mind-numbing
overload. ``That is something that we're going to be watching
closely. ...That risk of: Will we get turned off? That's a good
question,'' said Dukes.
</P>
<P>
   But better too much than not enough, Census officials say. Among
the problems in 1990 was the Census Bureau's reliance upon donated
time for public service announcements, which mostly aired late at
night or at other periods of slim audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the agency's task was a decision by the U.S. Supreme
Court last year that raised the stakes by forbidding the Census
Bureau from using statistical models to fill the projected gaps in
the undercount for the purposes of reapportioning congressional
districts.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no guessing, however scientific it may be. The
Census Bureau must make every effort to count every man, woman and
child.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In October, the Census Bureau awarded its advertising contract
to Young &AMP; Rubicam, whose corporate clients include Ford and AT&AMP;T.
The ad agency set about formulating a campaign unlike any other it
has ever done.
</P>
<P>
   While most companies seek to sell their products to people who
are inclined to buy them, the Census Bureau needed to tailor its
message to people who are reluctant or uninterested in filling out
the questionnaire. Thus, the Census Bureau needed a different sales
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that kept coming back to us again and again in
our research is that being counted means absolutely nothing to
people. Of the people who think about it at all, only a very small
percentage of mainly older Americans consider it as a patriotic
duty. What motivates most people is: What's in it for me?'' said
Dukes.
</P>
<P>
   To build a demographic model of their target audience, the ad
agency turned to existing data on the types of people who do and
don't participate in their local PTA, those who try to avoid jury
duty and those who do it but don't necessarily want to.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they identified three distinct groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ The largest, 43 percent of the population, are dubbed
``undecided passives.'' They may fill it out or not, but feel no
compelling reason to do so.
</P>
<P>
   _ The second group, at 40 percent, are those most likely to
respond. These are mainly white-collar, middle- and
upper-middle-class homeowners familiar with the census.
</P>
<P>
   _ The third group, at 17 percent, are those unlikely to fill out
the form at all, including immigrants, Native Americans and others
highly distrustful of government.
</P>
<P>
   Young &AMP; Rubicam took the lead in producing the themes for its
campaign to reach broad and reluctant middle America. It also
coordinated the effort among four subcontractors, ad agencies which
specialize in reaching African Americans, Hispanics, Asian
Americans and Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   By late March, chances are that most Americans will have been
exposed to at least 50 census ads on TV, radio or in print. Among
minorities, the exposure rate is at least twice that.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the census campaign is like a election campaign.
The Census Bureau and its ad agency won't be able to fully gauge
its effectiveness until the returns are in.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of putting this campaign together was inventing it for
the first time, which is why research played such a big role. We
really don't have an opportunity to get it wrong. It's a big
number, and a big public number,'' said Dukes. ``We had to be very,
very smart about how we handled this.''

FOR CAR SELLERS, IT'S SHOOTOUT TIME IN DOT.COM CITY

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The inquiries come in an inexorable flow over the electronic
transoms of fax and e-mail. They are not about ABS, SUVs,
transmissions, tires, engines, nuts, bolts, child restraint seats,
or road rage.
</P>
<P>
   They are each, instead, the same question from some PR person
somewhere: Wouldn't you like to write a story about some new auto
Web site (kicktires.com, bounceonseats.com, snakeoil.com,
feelyoungagain.com, buycars.com)? They are so numerous I feel like
an armadillo on a Texas highway filled with roaring, 10-wheeled
dot-coms. I scuttle out of the way and let the traffic pass.
</P>
<P>
   It's shootout time in Dot-Com City, and customers, automobile
manufacturers, and dealers are either targets or caught in the
crossfire. It is the dealers feeling the heat the most right now.
They've got to have individual dot-com capabilities but they fear
what widespread dot-com trade could do to their business.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from this year's annual convention of the National Auto
Dealers Association indicate that, for the second year in a row,
dot-com business was the talk of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintive wail from dealers: Don't let us get dot-commed by
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Your local auto dealership is a tangible Web site that you visit
in person. You browse. Click onto a car by kicking the tires. Open
a window by pulling on a door handle and climbing inside. For FAQs,
turn to a salesman. If you like the answers, you click on OK. If
you don't, you are the curser. It has long been thus.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   And that has dealers trembling. There are now third parties,
many with virtually no retail auto sales experience, trying to get
into the buof selling cars directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   You would think that NADA, with nearly 20,000 new car and truck
dealers holding 40,000 separate franchises, would have met the
challenge head-on and immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a lag. First, they had to fight off a potential
threat from another flank _ the manufacturers, who as of last
year's convention were still threatening to take their cars to
consumers directly over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That threat arose even as dealerships were setting up their own
Web sites showing inventory, financing plans, prices for parts,
service specials, and other offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers, meanwhile, were giving potential consumers such
information as suggested retail price, options, vehicle specs, and
consumer advice.
</P>
<P>
   Some independent sites, operating with dealer cooperation,
became ``brokers'' for dealers who cooperated with them.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, consumer service sites _ such as Kelley Blue
Book _ made it possible for potential buyers to walk onto any
showroom better informed than ever and ready to move on at click
speed if they didn't like what they heard.
</P>
<P>
   It all had to make dealers nervous.
</P>
<P>
   They got some relief: Several states passed laws protecting
franchised dealers. And by the time this year's NADA convention
rolled around, big automakers such as GM and Ford were vowing to
stand by their dealers and not sell cars directly to consumers on
line nor to sell franchises to Web site operators. How long the
latter can last, I'm not sure.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, according to the Automotive News, many potential
e-dealers and many millions of dollars were in play at this year's
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the threat, the magazine posed, of a computer
billionaire buying up dealerships across the country and using his
own electronic engine to drive sales, ``selling vehicles nationwide
via flatbed truck.''
</P>
<P>
   It could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of convention participant Brain Stafford who
came to town representing Trilogy Inc., a Texas software provider
that already has jumped into appliances, employee recruitment, and
gift registration.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford has no auto retailing experience, Automotive News said,
but he did arrive ready for a shootout: He had $100 million stuffed
into his holsters, looking to corral automobile franchises, mostly
of the small, rural (read inexpensive) herd.
</P>
<P>
   This would provide a platform for sales that would at least
mimic manufacturer-to-dealer-to-customer.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how long the manufacturers' promises to not let the
franchises be sold to these dot-com providers would hold up in
court.
</P>
<P>
   After all, once the practice of established franchises selling
directly over the Internet has become commonplace _ and it is
happening already _ how can it be possible to keep out legitimate
business people who want to buy into the action and do the same
thing?
</P>
<P>
   Would it be fair to tell franchise holders that they cannot sell
the businesses they have bought and built to someone who will
operate them in many similar ways?
</P>
<P>
   And, once the ball is rolling, how long will manufacturers be
able to stick to a vow of no direct Internet sales as they watch
third parties doing what they could be doing themselves?
</P>
<P>
   It's a scary time for dealerships, no doubt. But it is not a
time for anybody to even blink, let alone bury their heads in the
sand.
</P>
<P>
   The dot-com shootout is under way and dealerships and
manufacturers, if they want to continue to be players, need to play
with their strengths.
</P>
<P>
   I see a parallel here with my business, newspapers. Information
is the foundation of this business. No matter how it gets
delivered, folks who can gather, organize, and cogently present
information are valuable. That's why combinations of print media
and Internet sites are valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Now look at auto dealerships _ the bricks, glass, repair shops,
showroom floors _ as the foundation of that business. True, the
manufacturers roll out the product, but once it leaves their hands,
it is doubtful that, even in a high-tech future, many people will
buy new models of autos based only on photos. They're still going
to want to at least go kick the tires _ even if they return home
and do the purchase on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the manufacturers are still going to need places that
will service and repair the products they sell.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no reason, even though it means monumental change,
that dealerships can't remain players in all these areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ How times have changed. Daniel Ortega, the
unrepentant Marxist and nemesis of President Ronald Reagan, is
getting his nose powdered.
</P>
<P>
   A film crew from Canada is doing a documentary on the Nicaraguan
Revolution. Ortega is wearing his favorite colors _ khaki pants and
a crisp T-shirt with the United Colors of Benetton printed across
his chest. But the former Nicaraguan revolutionary leader is
fidgety and uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long is this going to last?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers want the mustachioed, legendary bad boy of the
1970s Cuban-style revolution to look, well, not so revolutionary.
Speak from the heart, they urge him.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega, however, can barely crack a smile. For him, the
revolution is too recent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great challenge of the Sandinistas is to regain power. In
1990, we lost the revolution,'' Ortega, 54, said in an interview
after he finished with the film crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still looking to destroy us, but we are still in the
ring fighting to mend the course of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely the course will change. At the end of the Cold
War, after the crumbling of the Soviet Union and the Berlin Wall,
Fidel Castro's Cuba is the only Communist holdout in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua, once the flashpoint of Reagan's anti-Communist
agenda, has slipped from the world stage. The Contras _ the
U.S.-backed militants fighting Ortega and his revolutionaries _ and
other players of the long, messy war are but fading memories.
</P>
<P>
   But change comes slowly in this lush land of lakes and
volcanoes, of sweet rum and strong coffee, where decades of civil
war, dictatorships, earthquakes and hurricanes have conspired to
starve the masses _ and enrich a few.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the 21st century, transformation is creeping in
on Nicaragua, a nascent democracy of 4.7 million people, struggling
to rise above crippling poverty, the autocratic habits of its
political elite, a long history of U.S. intervention and the
devastation of Hurricane Mitch in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For Ortega and his Sandinista National Liberation Front, the
second-largest political party in the country, it has been a long
haul from guerrilla to legislator.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-aged Sandinistas, now wielding cellular phones
instead of machine guns, are not really in vogue. And Ortega has
lost much of his personal magic.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas land reform and literacy drives were among his goals,
Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman, of the center-right Liberal
Constitutional Party, has embarked on a free-trade course to
attract foreign investors and beef up the nation's primitive
infrastructure since taking office in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a firsthand look as the country makes the transition is
Oliver P. Garza, who was named U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, this country was almost a Cuban-model state,''
Garza said. ``Look how long it took the United States to become a
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All these countries are in a state of evolution. They need
time to grow,'' said Garza, a Texan who has been a diplomat in
Mexico, Colombia and Panama. ``We should not rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Second to Haiti as the poorest country in the Western
Hemisphere, Nicaragua has $6 billion in foreign debt, made harder
to pay since Hurricane Mitch, which caused $1.7 billion in damage
to roads and crops, not to mention lives and memories. About 18,000
people were left homeless, and 3,000 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman, calling his country's external debt ``eternal debt,''
says it is going to take 60 years to repay it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to demonstrate is that we are a serious
government,'' Aleman, 53, said in an interview. ``We are trying to
take care of rural poverty, create incentives for production,
investment, a basic market economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a caravan of speeding vehicles, sirens wailing and a cloud of
dust behind them, Aleman and a government entourage comb the rocky
countryside virtually every day, opening new schools, housing for
hurricane victims, electrical power plants and potable water
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Banners with his slogan, ``Works, Not Words,'' are up all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the fanfare is to ensure his party's victory in the
next election. Others disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he zipped through the community of El Tanque, 60 miles
northwest of Managua, and dedicated 167 cement-block homes for
hurricane victims.
</P>
<P>
   In this flat land, the cornfields are the only relief from the
sun. In the background is the San Cristobal volcano, which has been
spewing ash for two months. Next to it is the Casitas volcano,
where a white barren scar runs down the middle, evidence of the
mudslide that buried 2,000 when Hurricane Mitch blew into Nicaragua
and neighboring Honduras in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big tomb. Hundreds are still buried there,'' said
Red Cross worker Orlando Abellan.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of El Tanque are happy after Aleman's visit. They like
the new two-room homes, painted bright yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Alonso Rueda and his wife, Mariana Centeno, lost more than 50
family members when a river of mud swept down the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost everything: parents, children, cousins, nephews,''
said Rueda, 72. ``We rescued only two adults and four of our
children's children.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them is 10-year-old grandson Marvin, his body slashed with
inch-thick scars carved by debris.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Aleman makes routine rounds, he now is in Sandinista
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that boy Daniel (Ortega) cared more for the poor,''
said Mariana Centeno. ``We had more work. There were more jobs. Now
we have nothing, just what we can grow.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby town of Posoltega, several hundred people, mostly
farmers, are living in plastic tents donated by the Red Cross and
the U.S. government. They have been waiting for new homes for more
than a year. They watch the volcano with wariness and fear the
month of April, when rains begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gotten even a grain of rice,'' said 36-year-old
Justa Flores, who lives in a tiny tent with her husband and nine
children. ``I planted marigolds, so I wouldn't be surrounded by so
much misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever they can, families get odd jobs. They even return to
the volcano, where land is fertile, to plant maize, beans and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aid has been slow going. A lot of countries are
contributing aid, but the damage is such that it's going to take
time,'' said Ambassador Garza.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend among the poor is to occupy land anywhere they can.
I talked to one person who lost all his family except one. And he
still farms the land where his house was. Because it's theirs,''
Garza said. ``It's hard to get people out of flood plain areas.
Moving a whole town, it's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. government policy toward Nicaragua is to strengthen its
democratic institutions, and Garza has said there needs to be
``transparency'' in government _ that is, no corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan supported by the International Monetary Fund,
Nicaragua is a candidate for debt relief, a project under which
developed nations write off money owed _ albeit with strict
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States forgave most of Nicaragua's $248 million debt
after the 1990 election ousted the Sandinistas. Since 1998,
Washington has provided about $200 million for debt and hurricane
relief.
</P>
<P>
   But as democracy takes root, accusations of sleaze and illicit
enrichment abound.

 MANAGUA, Nicaragua: x x x illicit enrichment abound.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing has raised more suspicion than the recent deal Aleman
made with Ortega, once bitter enemies, to change 17 articles of the
constitution. Among them are immunity from prosecution for outgoing
presidents and vice presidents and a permanent seat in parliament.
The agreement also nudged aside so-called ``microparties'' that
received government funding, even if they weren't formal parties.
</P>
<P>
   The pact also reduced the percentage vote needed to win the
presidency, from 45 percent to 40 percent, which could give the
Sandinistas a better shot in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the deal creates a formidable two-party system that
an outsider could have a hard time ousting.
</P>
<P>
   Without the pact, Aleman said, he had no peace from the
boisterous Sandinistas, who were forever staging demonstrations
against capitalist changes, including the privatization of
government businesses. Since 1991, more than 350 state institutions
have gone public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were strikes, protests. So we called our opponents to
sit at the table and not at the barricades,'' Aleman said. ``That's
the way to act with the opposition _ civilized. Don't the
Republicans and Democrats make agreements all the time? Nicaraguan
people want to live in peace. Our only enemy is misery, poverty and
unemployment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Aleman said, the pact does not mean there is new-found
love with Ortega, who jailed Aleman during the Sandinista
government. Aleman's wife died of cancer while he was imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sandinistas now appear to be good, nice, more saintly than
Ghandi,'' the president said. ``But they will never again return to
power. I would rather die.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amid the controversy is a scandal involving Aleman himself, who
is accused by Comptroller General Agustin Jarquin of
influence-peddling and enriching himself.
</P>
<P>
   Jarquin filed charges in the National Assembly in January
accusing Aleman of using the presidency to buy thousands of
state-owned coffee plants and fruit trees at radically reduced
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm accused of buying property? It wasn't a gift. I didn't
steal it. I bought it. Is the president not a citizen?'' Aleman
said. ``My grandfather was a coffee grower. My father was a coffee
grower. I'm a coffee grower. If they are so ready to accuse me, let
them prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding irony to scandal is the fact that Jarquin, believed to
have political ambitions as well as popularity, just got out of
jail himself. He was placed under temporary arrest for allegedly
paying a reporter to investigate corruption under Aleman.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaraguans don't know what to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The economy and polls so far favor Aleman. Under his
administration the economy has grown 5 percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Managua, virtually destroyed by a 1972 earthquake and ignored by
years of civil war, is seeing a bit of a boom. Roads are being
paved, avenues widened and luxury hotels are going up.
</P>
<P>
   For Ortega, however, the capitalist road leads to corruption of
the rich and destitution for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   He admits mistakes. He's sorry he controlled agricultural prices
and did not allow a free market, and he said he failed in
consolidating land reform.
</P>
<P>
   As happened during Cuba's revolution, the Sandinistas
confiscated hundreds of properties from the wealthy and distributed
them among the poor _ and among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are about 800 cases in court, with Nicaraguans and
American citizens demanding the return of their properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not able to establish a socialist state, but we
started a liberal democracy, with all its negative elements,''
Ortega said. ``I'm not satisfied, but Nicaragua will never again
resort to arms to change a government. And we did that. We also
made the United States look differently at Latin America.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   After overthrowing in 1979 the U.S.-backed regime of Anastasio
Somoza, the patriarch of a family dynasty that ruled despotically
since 1937, the Sandinistas faced a more formidable enemy _ Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   He froze aid to Nicaragua in 1981, imposed a trade embargo and
forces in his administration embarked on the relentless Contra war,
financed by selling arms to Iran, to topple Ortega.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega won the presidency with 64 percent of the vote in 1984.
But the Contra war took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Sandinistas held new elections, which they lost to
a U.S.-funded coalition headed by Violeta Chamorro de Barrios,
widow of popular la Prensa newspaper publisher Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro, who had been killed by Somoza.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega said he lost for two reasons: the economic hardship of
the Contra war and the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama, which put the
fear of an almighty ``American empire'' into Nicaraguans. He said
his popularity dropped afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Sandinistas lost again to the center-right Liberal
Constitutional Party, a conservative group led by Aleman, the
former mayor of Managua, who won with 52 percent of the vote. The
Sandinistas came in second with 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Sandanistas have 36 seats in the National Assembly,
while Aleman's Liberals the presidency and 46 seats in the 90-seat
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sandinistas were organized to be in power, but not to be
an opposition party. They had no democratic training,'' said Sergio
Ramirez, a lawyer and former vice president under Ortega who broke
with the Sandinistas in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't understand the situation. They lost in 1990, lost
even bigger in 1996 and will lose again a fourth and fifth time,''
said Ramirez, now an author.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are now a traditional party,'' said Ramirez, who also
teaches literature at the University of Maryland. ``They don't have
the mythical sheen of the revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides a new political climate, Ortega was hurt by allegations
by his stepdaughter, Zoilamerica Ortega Murillo, now in her 30s,
that he had sexually abused her since she was 11.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega denies the accusation, calling it ``slander and infamy''
to hurt him politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been so hard on my family. Because she is not only
the daughter of my wife, she is the sister of my children,'' he
said. ``But I'm used to being accused of things all the time. I can
still give much to the country, with a lot of enthusiasm, vitality
and hope.''

   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ He's our man in Nicaragua, no stranger to
political intrigue, drug violence and international disputes.
</P>
<P>
   He is Oliver P. Garza, who was named U.S. ambassador last
September in one of the most troubled and poorest nations in the
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taken aback at what I saw from the ride to this
residence, at how much poverty you could see,'' Garza said from his
home. ``More in comparison to anywhere else I've been.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been to many places, having served as a diplomat in
Mexico, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, South Korea and Uruguay,
among others. A graduate of St. Mary's University in San Antonio,
ex-drug enforcement agent and veteran diplomat with a plenty of
experience in strife-torn countries, Garza hasn't wasted any time
in getting to know Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately delved into the subtle _ and not-so-subtle _
predicaments and complex politics of this emerging democracy mired
in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   He regularly meets with the president, with would-be presidents,
ex-presidents and players from all ideologies. He has visited
practically every corner of this New York state-sized nation,
talking to farmers, construction workers, housewives and hurricane
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Garza is one of the highest profile personalities in Nicaragua,
where the American government has been vilified or beloved,
depending on events of the times and who is in power.
</P>
<P>
   It is said there are two people here one visits to get things
done: Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, historically beyond
ethical reproach, and the U.S. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know now how the cardinal feels,'' said Garza, referring to
the long list of people who daily request an audience to complain
about this or that or to ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   One moment he is having a private lunch with President Arnoldo
Aleman, and the next he is receiving a shipment of U.S. aid for
victims of a devastating hurricane in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But first things first. His morning routine: up before 6 a.m., a
walk through the grounds _ hoping for a peek at the residential
peacock and giant lizard. Then he hits the newspapers and makes
coffee with his wife, Yolanda.
</P>
<P>
   He stunned the help by insisting on grinding and brewing his own
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   He comes to the post at a crucial time for Nicaragua, a
democracy only since 1990, when elections ousted the left-wing
government of the Sandinista National Liberation Front headed by
Daniel Ortega, who still aspires to regain power.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first people Garza went to meet was Ortega, a bitter
enemy of the United States since he was a teen-ager opposed to
American involvement in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandinista talk is still colored by revolutionary talk from
the Socialist line. They are looking to get back to power, but they
are going to have to adjust their words and economic outlook,''
Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sandinistas have changed, but you continue to see Daniel
Ortega going back to the same rhetoric, traveling to the old Soviet
block countries,'' Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Garza, the son of a farm laborer, has found an
admirer in Ortega, from humble roots himself.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the new ambassador, Ortega, who rarely smiles, got a
big grin across his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good meeting with Mr. Garza. I'm glad that we have
someone with Latin-American roots, a Hispanic, as ambassador,''
Ortega said. ``It will facilitate communication with the United
States, my country and the Sandinistas. We hope to maintain and
develop this relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sandinistas, once a large army of 80,000, have dwindled to
about 14,000. Garza said they pose no threat and have evolved
mostly as a police force, similar to what happened to Panama's
National Guard after the 1989 U.S. invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider the numbers that existed, Nicaragua has gone
far,'' the ambassador said. ``The army has been responsive to
democracy and civilian rule.''
</P>
<P>
   In a fledgling democracy, public bickering, accusations of
corruption and political maneuverings are all too common. They are
rampant now in Nicaragua.

   McCAIN-BUSH (Greenville, S.C.) _ John McCain, likening himself
to Ronald Reagan, appeals to Democrats and independents to join
Republicans to deliver him a victory in Saturday's crucial GOP
primary. Meanwhile, George W. Bush, campaigning in Florence, S.C.,
accuses McCain of riding a ``high horse on a low road'' by
continuing to distribute a flyer that says Bush's tax cut plan
would damage the future of Social Security. The latest polls show
the two in a statistical dead heat with turnout the likely
determining factor. By STEWART M. POWELL and DAN FREEDMAN.

   BUSH-SPEECH (Myrtle Beach, S.C.) _ We analyze George W. Bush's

agenda is drawing distinctions between him and John McCain. By DAN

After years of such stunts, however, it is clear the zealots have
already lost that battle. Women still like fur coats. So People for

YES, AMANDA PEET IS WEARING A GUN (AND THAT'S ABOUT IT)
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's about half an hour into ``The Whole Nine Yards.'' Matthew
Perry, who plays a neurotic Montreal dentist, has been waving his
arms and pratfalling all over the screen. Bruce Willis has been
striking terse, insinuating tough-guy poses as the hit man next
door. Michael Clarke Duncan, ``The Green Mile's'' gentle giant,
plays another professional criminal and has been filling up much
empty space.
</P>
<P>
   But just as you're about to write the film off as a desperate
``Analyze This'' wanna-be, an unexpected presence suddenly raises
it to an hilarious new level. Willis gets interesting. Duncan gets
interesting. Perry's slapstick becomes funny.
</P>
<P>
   It appears as if the whole movie has been lifted on the slender
shoulders of Amanda Peet. The self-effacing, 28-year-old actress
says no, of course not; she's working with comic masters here, and
she's just a stage-trained dramatic actress from one of those WB
network youth soaps.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the movie's writing and timing does get sharper right
around the time that Peet's perky character comes into her own. But
there's no discounting her contribution to that process, either.
Not since Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta debated the merits of
French fast food has so delightfully distinctive a contract killer
appeared on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonathan Lynn kept telling me that, if Jill weren't aspiring
to the profession that she is, she would be a cheerleader,'' says
Peet. ``Just bubbly and enthusiastic and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran British farce director Lynn (the BBC's ``Yes,
Minister,'' ``My Cousin Vinny'') knew that the part _ which, in
``Nine Yards''' ethically upside-down universe, is also the closest
thing to the movie's conscience _ required adroit presentation.
</P>
<P>
   And an extra something special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key to someone who is so fundamentally amoral is
that they must be played by an actress who you automatically
like,'' Lynn says. ``It's a beautifully written role, of course,
but Amanda brought what was there on the page to life with her own,
unique, quirky personality. And she has such charm.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, the actress says that she was just striving not to
look ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun to do but scary, because I had to figure out a way
not to show how silly I thought she was,'' explains Peet, whose
training included a stint with the legendarily serious acting
teacher Uta Hagen. ``I learned from Bruce and Matthew and Jonathan
about how important it was to bring precision to comedy
performance, building gags bit by bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Peet is hesitant to make a spectacle of herself. In
fact, while Jill's cheerful personality and oddball sense of right
and wrong make the performance memorable, audiences aren't likely
to forget the scenes Peet plays wearing nothing but a .38 and a
megawatt smile either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did full-frontal nudity on stage before,'' Peet reveals,
``and, really, I was the least nervous in that scene, the most
grounded. It's kind of like a counter-phobia feeling that I brought
to this. When the camera rolls, and you're with someone the
magnitude of Bruce Willis, you're already scared. But then, when
you do something that's even worse, it belittles the original fear.
In a way, that's very liberating.''
</P>
<P>
   And that registers fully on screen, despite obvious
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amanda was very relaxed about it,'' says Lynn. ``She must be
one of the very few people in the world who could play a nude scene
and be funny at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing ``Nine Yards''' uninhibited Jill was a behavioral 180
from Peet's day job on TV's ``Jack and Jill'' _ in which, as if to
prove the point, she plays Jack. And Jack, essentially, is a dull
girl, an uptight, aspiring New York journalist who, at midseason
anyway, is involved with someone but in love with someone else, an
upstairs neighbor played by Ivan Sergei (his character's last name
is Jillefsky _ get it?).
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack's sort of a control freak, a la Meg Ryan in `When Harry
Met Sally...,'' Peet says, invoking another idol in her vast
pantheon of role models. ``I try to be really anal, have a lot of
Post-It notes around and stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to play,'' she says. ``But no more or less so than
the woman in `Nine Yards.' What's fun is having a hook, a thing
that you can commit to. I want the opportunity to play characters
with doubts and flaws. There's a weird thing with actors, maybe
especially with women, that's all about being appealing. But I
think that's the biggest trap. Anything that gets you away from
that kind of vanity can only be good for your work.''
</P>
<P>
   Peet is well aware that there's irony in a statement like that
coming from one of network TV's pretty young faces. In fact, she's
too smart to miss the absurdities that are part and parcel of an
actor's life. The daughter of a Manhattan lawyer and a social
worker, she studied American history at Columbia University before
sharpening her focus on acting, which she'd been dabbling in since
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of rejection eventually led to stage work, appearances on
``Seinfeld,'' ``Law and Order'' and ``Spin City,'' and parts in
such films as ``One Fine Day,'' ``She's the One,'' ``Body Shots''
and last month's ``Isn't She Great.'' Although set in her hometown,
``Jack and Jill'' is the first job that's prompted cross-country
relocation.
</P>
<P>
   And Peet is seriously homesick. Although, typically, she takes
an absurdist view of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all like a suburb,'' she says of L.A. ``And when I see
palm trees, it's very strange, especially during Christmas and New
Year's. The cotton snow everywhere ...''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the weather's better.
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' she huffs with comic exaggeration. ``It's like a weird,
bad dream!''
</P>
<P>
   All right then. Peet does the petulant thing funny, too, and
we're likely to see more of that in her next movie, ``Whipped.'' A
comedy about three con men who all fall in love with the same
woman. The picture is currently rated NC-17 solely for its frank,
sexually charged language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bizarre that they're taking seriously the impact of
language in a movie that, tonally, verges on spoof,'' Peet says.
``The movie overtly does not condone or hero-ify what is being said
but rather makes buffoons out of the people who say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And because it also involves women talking very graphically
about sexual matters, that's probably particularly offensive to the
ratings board,'' she adds. ``We're not supposed to be discussing
those things _ or having any of those preoccupations.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ``Whipped'' controversy's final outcome may be, the
movie is a hit with Peet. She met her boyfriend, actor Brian Van
Holt (CBS' ``Love &AMP; Money''), on the production.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Peet hopes to develop her obviously natural
gift for comedy while nurturing and deepening her dramatic
abilities. She'll always be serious about acting, but she's
discovering that the only way to get better at it is to have
serious fun with the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comedy is so hard, but I'm learning more and more that so much
of it is about relaxation,'' Peet explains. ``For a long time, I
think I thought I was really good, but really I was terrible
because I was trying to orchestrate things. You can't do that,
because the camera sees it, and the audience sees it _ it takes you
out of the moment, and it's not fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell when an actor's really reveling in something and
when they're just planning and indicating what's happening. It's an
ongoing struggle to get that right, but I genuinely find it
fascinating.'' &QL;

DOUBLE `LAW &AMP; ORDER' and `X-FILES' MEETS `COPS' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHY FIGHT THE `LAW'?: The veteran on the force, ``Law &AMP; Order,''
teams up tonight with its promising rookie partner, ``Law &AMP; Order:
Special Victims Unit,'' for a two-part episode about abuse of power
that has more twists and turns than a Cirque du Soleil performance.
Jane Alexander stars as the matriarch of a powerful, politically
connected family with a tradition of tragedy, who steps between our
heroes (Chris Meloni and Mariska Hargitay of ``SVU,'' Jerry Orbach
and Jesse L. Martin of ``L&AMP;O'') and her daughter, whose role in the
murder of a womanizer gets murkier the deeper the investigation
probes.
</P>
<P>
   Superficially, the family resembles the Kennedys with its holy
triumvirate of political clout, legal woes and untimely deaths, but
given the manner with which the family uses its muscle to cow and
obfuscate the city's Powers That Be, it's telling that the family's
attorney is named Rumsey. Mobsters and hit men are also involved _
good thing conspiracy theorist Munch (Richard Belzer) is on hand to
sort things out. Screenwriters Robert Palm, Wendy West and Richard
Sweren (working off a story by Palm, Rene Balcer and franchise
creator Dick Wolf) keep the narrative convolutions fascinating,
sensational and miraculously straightforward. As usual with these
shows, the procedural is intelligently gripping from start to
finish. ``SVU'' kicks off the story at 9 p.m., followed by ``L&AMP;O''
at 10 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BAD BOYS?: On Sunday, ``The X-Files'' features its own crossover
_ with the reality series ``Cops'' _ and as unlikely as the pairing
seems (Fox's classiest show slumming with one of its dodgiest), the
eccentric experiment works. Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully
(Gillian Anderson) are drawn into the video camera's glare while
investigating a paranormal bogeyman of the sort that they're
well-acquainted with, though the camera crews decidedly aren't.
It's alternately funny and exciting, particularly when Scully tries
in vain to avoid the cameras, and when Mulder tries
(unsuccessfully) to keep from laughing while interviewing a
flamboyant couple named Steve and Edy. It's a clever entry in what
has been a sort of middling year for the show. &QL;

DO THE TIME, THEN THE CRIME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Rob Lowman's weekly video column. Note ITALICS below) 
 
 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Critics and legal experts were quick to point out that the basic
premise of ``Double Jeopardy'' was flawed. If you are convicted of
killing your husband and it turns out he's really alive, you can't
go ahead and kill him no matter how despicable he is.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that you can't be tried for the same crime
twice, killing your spouse after a first conviction would be
considered a second crime, and thus you (BEGIN ITALICS)can(END
ITALICS) be tried for it.
</P>
<P>
   But logic is not the strong suit of ``Double Jeopardy,'' which
will be in video stores Tuesday. It's a film you have to go with to
enjoy. Or (BEGIN ITALICS)to(END ITALICS), since the film did
surprisingly well at the box office, which means that the theme of
a woman who's wronged, goes to jail, pumps iron, gets released and
goes after the man who wronged her with a vengeance hit a nerve
with a segment of the moviegoing audience (mostly women, maybe?).
</P>
<P>
   But director Bruce Beresford and solid acting turns by Ashley
Judd and Tommy Lee Jones (doing a variation on his ``Fugitive''
character) manage to turn your attention from the convoluted plot
and implausibilities to create a relatively entertaining film.
</P>
<P>
   Beresford, who has directed better films (``Tender Mercies'' and
``Driving Miss Daisy''), wisely concentrates on Judd, who
throughout the film becomes a woman you wouldn't want to mess with
while keeping her nice suburban soccer mom credentials. Judd, who
has shown herself to be an interesting actress, seems to pull this
off with the force of her personality rather than acting skill.
It's too bad Judd is gravitating toward femme fatale roles (note
the recent ``Eye of the Beholder'') because she seems capable of
much more. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `JULES AND JIM'
</P>
<P>
   ``Jules and Jim'' is one of the great films from the French New
Wave, which produced such groundbreaking directors as Jean Luc
Goddard, Louis Malle, Claude Chabrol and Francois Truffaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jules,'' released in 1961, is perhaps Truffaut's most
memorable film, an extraordinary meditation on love and friendship.
Based on Henri-Pierre Roche's 1953 novel, it is the story of Jules
(Oskar Werner), a shy German Jew who befriends an outgoing
Frenchman, Jim (Henri Serre), in pre-World War I France.
</P>
<P>
   The two quickly become inseparable, sharing interests in art and
theater. When they are shown an ancient Greek statue of a woman
with an enigmatic smile, the pair agree that if they ever meet such
a real woman they would never let her go. Inevitably, she appears
in the form of Catherine (Jeanne Moreau) _ whose personality is
just as enigmatic as her smile.

   Roche (1879-1959), a critic for most of his life, wrote this
semi-autobiographical novel in his 70s. The clarity and simplicity
with which he distills this complicated love triangle is something
that only someone who has put years of distance between himself and
the affair could do. Truffaut (1932-1984) was a man much closer in
age to the two protagonists when he made the film. The filmmaker
brought his youthful exuberance to the story without sacrificing
its mature aspects.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps one of the most perfect adaptations of a novel in
cinematic history, though whether a film translates well to the
screen is a specious way to judge a movie. (All forms of art adapt
or are inspired by others. Only film suffers the burden of being
judged on its translation, proving two things: Film critics can
read, and they are too literal.)
</P>
<P>
   Truffaut's coup includes casting of the luminescent Moreau, who
Roche got to see pictures of just four days before he died. He
approved of Truffaut's Kate. &QL;

   CONGRESS-OUTLOOK (Washington) _ A month into this
campaign-compressed congressional year, it's hard to tell which
Congress will emerge: the incrementally productive one that is
working with the White House to pass a key China trade bill and
repeal limits on Social Security earnings, or the do-nothing one

   SCI-LIVER-DISEASE (Undated) _ After successful experiments with
mice, scientists say they have found what could be a promising way
to treat cirrhosis of the liver, an intractable condition that is
the seventh-leading cause of death in the United States. Reporting
in the journal Science, the researchers say they reversed symptoms

   ALASKA-AVALANCHES () _ At least 33 major avalanches have struck

awesome natural power is continually on display, has been
extraordinary. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

<P>
   RAIL-MERGER (Montreal) _ For much of the last century, the
Canadian National railroad helped define Canada. But now Canadian
National plans to merge with a giant American railroad, the
Burlington Northern and Santa Fe, and its focus has shifted to the
south. The merger underscores how far the formation of a true North
American economy has developed in the six years since the North
American Free Trade Agreement went into effect. Although they may
be less visible, the auto, banking, and telecommunications
industries already operate on a north-south axis and pay hardly any
attention to borders. Not everyone accepts the vision of the new
railroad or the changes it represents. In the United States,
shippers and unions want to derail the deal. In Canada, shippers
and farmers are concerned, while nationalists see the proposed
merger as the loss of a revered national symbol. By Anthony
DePalma.

<P>
   FED-GREENSPAN (Washington) _ Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the
Federal Reserve, warns that the economy is in danger of overheating
even after the central bank has raised interest rates. In comments
that are certain to bolster expectations that the Fed will continue
a series of quarter-point rate increases this year, Greenspan said
that there was ``little evidence'' that the economy is slowing and
that the prices of stocks, homes and other assets were being pushed
ever-higher and raising consumer demand beyond the economy's
ability to produce goods and services. Stocks, which had risen
sharply before his testimony on the back of a weaker-than-expected
producer prices report, reversed course after Greenspan's testimony
before the House Banking Committee. By Richard W. Stevenson.

NASDAQ composite was up 95 points. Treasury prices were mixed, with

Seng ended down 0.36 percent. Crude oil slipped below $30 a barrel,

JUDDS REUNITE AND ARE ON THE ROAD AGAIN

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional trim included) 
 
By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A quick check of the answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael, it's Naomi Judd and I'm calling earlier because I'm
excited. It's quarter after 10 a.m. I'll call you back.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to describe Naomi Judd isn't easy because she is a woman
who has lived many lives. A few identities can be tried on for
size, and all of them would fit well.
</P>
<P>
   _ Survivor: As a divorced mother of two in the mid-'70s who
broke free of an abusive relationship and took care of her
children, she could be said to have survived a rough single
motherhood. It's also a description fitting to her winning battle
with hepatitis C, which sidelined her from performing in 1991. Her
body is now rid of the affliction.
</P>
<P>
   _ Entrepreneur: After she and daughter Wynonna started singing
country lullabies as the Judds to anybody who would listen, the duo
landed a recording contract in 1983. Their first single, ``Had a
Dream'' (For the Heart), went Top 20 on the country-music charts.
Soon after, they had a string of eight consecutive No. 1 hits and
became the most successful female country-music duo in history.
</P>
<P>
   _ Proud: As in proud mama. Following Naomi's retirement from
performing, Wynonna continued with a successful solo career that
has included several platinum albums and three No. 1 singles from
her self-titled debut. She just released ``New Day Dawning.''
Naomi's other daughter, Ashley, has become a big-ticket movie star,
appearing in the movies ``A Time to Kill,'' ``Double Jeopardy'' and
the recently released ``Eye of the Beholder.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Plucky: After an eight-year hiatus, a healthy Naomi Judd
reunited with Wynonna in the studio, and the Judds recorded four
songs. The tracks _ including the Naomi-penned barn-dance romp
``Big Bang Boogie'' and a cover of Jesse Winchester's ``That's What
Makes You Strong'' _ are included as a bonus CD with Wynonna's
``New Day Dawning.''
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, on New Year's Eve, the Judds performed together for
the first time since 1991's farewell tour. They have extended the
tour through March. and included a date at the Houston Livestock
Show and Rodeo, where they will perform Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   All are apt descriptions, but none suit Naomi Judd as well as
``personable'' does. Her rags-to-riches-to-sickness-to-health story
is the stuff miniseries are made of and has given her a
spirituality and day-to-day joyfulness that most take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Another check of the answering machine 10 minutes after the
first message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael, have you seen `Eye of the Beholder' yet? It's really
good. This is Ashley Judd's mother _ sometimes known as Wynonna's
mother, too. So take your wife or poopsie-woopsie to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did I mention that she is market-savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Answering the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael, I finally found you ... ''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many situations that Naomi Judd can't relate to
because, at some time in her life, she has dealt with them all.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, she wears lavish designer gowns on stage now, but she
recalls living in Marin County in the San Francisco Bay area on
deloused mattresses while studying to be a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get back (to the Bay area), sometimes I'll rent a
hunk-a-junk car, go out with my hair up and no makeup on and visit
that old apartment,'' Naomi says. ``When I put on a $6,000 gown
now, I cackle because I remember when I had three dresses to my
name.''
</P>
<P>
   When she finally made it to the top of country music and had
wealth and all of life's comforts, she contracted hepatitis C,
sometimes referred to as chronic liver disease. There was no amount
of money that could help her because fewer than 10 percent of
hepatitis C cases make a complete recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Riches and celebrity couldn't save Naomi, but they were
certainly going to do all they could. After traveling the country
looking for cures, she now counts some of the leading surgeons and
hepatologists in the United States as friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very grim disease,'' says Naomi, who is now the
spokesperson for the National Liver Foundation. ``I think I've
become somewhat of an inspiration _ not to the patients, but to the
doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first to help Judd was a psychologist, Dr. Blair
Justice, who is based at the University of Texas Health Science
Center in Houston and the author of the book ``Who Gets Sick.''
Naomi met with him following a Houston concert on the Judds'
farewell tour.
</P>
<P>
   Justice had never heard of Naomi or the Judds, but he couldn't
believe that she was touring with hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to meet me after the show and he said, `You're not
going to put on pantyhose, brush your hair and perform,''' recalls
Naomi, who says she was fatigued at nearly every stop.
</P>
<P>
   She continues, ``Afterward he shook his finger at me and said,
`You little stinker. I know what you're doing. You are using this
support to keep you going.' And he was right.''

   Judd has other ties to Houston _ memories that make playing the
rodeo a joy even though the Judds won't have the time to perform
their whole show on their own stage.

   While she is now happily married to former Elvis Presley sideman
Larry Strickland, during a separation years ago, she went on a
blind date with ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons.

<P>
   Touring in 2000 is different for the Judds from what it was in
the old days. The women no longer move from town to town in the
``Judd-Mobile'' eating pinto beans and corn bread at truck stops.

   Naomi and Wynonna each have their own bus, and now Wynonna is
the single mom traveling with her two toddlers, Elijah and Grace.
She divorced her husband, Arch Kelley, last June.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi describes Wynonna's bus as a day-care center, while hers
is a peaceful valley of candles and aromatherapy. She's ecstatic to
be on the road again, happily married and enjoying the careers of
her daughters.
</P>
<P>
   At the New Year's Eve show in Phoenix, Naomi even joked with
Ashley about her roles in movies in which she plays murderers or
bares skin.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, it appeared that a rift was forming among the Judds
about morality, but on stage in Pheonix as 2000 rolled near, she
just shook her finger at special guest Ashley and said, ``You're
grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   After being broke and a single mom, after superstardom, after
critical illness, Naomi is just happy to be and is making no
promises about what the future might hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just keep putting one foot right in front of the other,''
she said. ``Right now I feel fab-u-lous.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the best word to describe her.

&HT;     NEW YORK CONSERVATIVE RECONSIDERS SUPPORT FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Frustrated by what he called a ``pattern of
pandering'' by George W. Bush, one New York congressman says he is
``seriously reconsidering'' his support for the Republican
presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Rep. Peter T. King said, a ``significant'' number of
Republicans in the state also are quietly questioning Bush's
viability in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing discontent,'' King, a conservative Republican from
Nassau County, said from his Washington office on Wednesday. But he
added: ``How far they're going to go, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   King's announcement came as Bush, the governor of Texas, faces a
hard-fought primary race in South Carolina after suffering a
19-point loss to GOP rival John McCain in New Hampshire two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Bush and McCain are locked in a statistical
dead heat, according to a Zogby International poll released
Wednesday. In New York, the Texas governor holds a 44-37 percent
edge over McCain, who was behind by 19 points last month, according
to a Quinnipiac survey.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican Party spokesman Dan Allen said he knew of no
New York Republicans who are backing away from Bush. ``I'm
surprised to hear that,'' Allen said of King's comments,
``especially considering how much support at the grass-roots level
that George Bush has. ... If anything, we've been getting even more
calls that people are gung-ho for him.''
</P>
<P>
   King said he was troubled by several recent Bush comments and
appearances _ most notably his visit to Bob Jones University, a
Christian institution in South Carolina that bars interracial
dating and has harshly criticized the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this whole pattern here of pandering to anti-Catholic
elements,'' said King, who is Catholic. Bush was also wrong, King
said, to align the Nation of Islam with faith-based organizations
during a television interview and to describe the Northern Ireland
peace process as ``falling apart'' in Tuesday night's GOP debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am seriously reconsidering my support,'' King said. ``I try
to have a sense of loyalty, but the loyalty is really being
stretched right now.''
</P>
<P>
   However, King said he was neither prepared to immediately break
ranks with Bush or to back McCain, the senior senator from Arizona.
King first came out for Bush for president in May as part of an
elaborate endorsement ceremony staged by New York Gov. George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the governor probably did the right thing at the right
time,'' King said. Asked if he thought Pataki still should support
Bush, King said only: ``The governor can think for himself.''

&HT;     `ALLY': JUST ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ We are watching ``Ally McBeal'' and trying (as
we always do) not to talk to the TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   We watch ``Ally'' now and then because it is a phenomenon. Its
characters, plot lines, special effects and peculiar buzzwords have
become a major part of the national cultural fabric.
</P>
<P>
   We do not watch ``Ally'' because it resonates for us personally.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this failure to connect is due to an age gap. Ally and her
eccentric pals are in their early 30s at most; we are 50.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe we don't connect because we have this quaint
idea that even a semi-comic show about a young, supposedly
intelligent woman lawyer ought to have more than just trace
elements of female input on its creative team of producer, director
and writer.
</P>
<P>
   We know that Ally's creator and Svengali, the prolific David
Kelley, has long insisted that his title character is not meant to
be anybody's symbol of new womanhood.
</P>
<P>
   But, as ``Ally McBeal'' has insinuated itself into the
collective consciousness _ and amassed a warehouse of Emmy, Golden
Globe and People's Choice awards _ we also know that SOMEHOW the
big-eyed, elfin Ally and other female characters on the show have
come to symbolize a brand of new womanhood: They are all fabulous
looking and as capable in their professional lives as they are
desperate, bumbling or coldly manipulative in their personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ally is such a part of the national Zeitgeist, we do
something different when we watch it: We keep our finger off the
remote control mute button and make ourselves listen to the
commercials. (We think you can tell almost as much about the makeup
of a hit show's audience from its ads as you can from the show
itself.) On this night, we are struck most by a light-beer
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not the one that features a pair of idiot, bar-camping
babes on the perpetual make. Neither is it one of a series in which
non-speaking (but always large-breasted), bar-camping babes simply
decorate the scene of ``Preppie Dudes Just Want To Have Fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this light beer commercial opens with a babe _ all
clingy dress, long legs and mounds of luxurious hair _ sitting next
to a good-looking man on a train.
</P>
<P>
   The man peruses the babe with a smarmy, arrogant glance that
immediately labels him as ``Loser.`` Then, with the assured aplomb
of James Bond, another good-looking man, sitting across the aisle
from the babe, orders a specific brand of light beer.
</P>
<P>
   The train enters a tunnel and the screen goes dark for a few
seconds. When the lights come on, the now-beaming babe has moved
across the aisle and has her arm linked through the arm of the man
who is drinking his light beer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite our best intentions, we begin to talk to the TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect,'' we groan. ``This is not only woman-as-trophy, it's
trophy that can be had for the price of a watery domestic beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not even the price of a beer! The woman has no beer. She's
starry-eyed and all-his just because HE'S drinking the watery
domestic beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, we remember reading a magazine article about what is
and is not intended by today's cooler-than-thou young advertising
wizzes. Most campaigns are meant as ``jokes, exaggerations,'' said
one successful wiz. Their primary aim is merely ``to grab
eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   That reminds us of something else Kelley told Goodman in 1998:
``It's not our intent that everyone is supporting Ally every week.
But at the end of the week ... you're still involved with her. You
may be frustrated for being so, but we hope the audience comes
back.''
</P>
<P>
   And so they have.
</P>
<P>
   After all, like the babes-and-beer ads, ``Ally McBeal'' isn't
about role models, aspirations or inspiration. It's just
entertainment. An exaggeration. All in harmless fun. Right? We must
remember not to take it so seriously.

 &HT;     APPLE PLANS HEFTIER iBOOK IN SHADES OF GRAY  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATT BEER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Apple Computer Inc. has announced improvements
to the company's product line, including a beefier iBook laptop
that has double the memory and hard-drive size of the previous
model.
</P>
<P>
   The new machine's gray-hued color theme runs counter to the
existing two orange and blue portables. The ``tangerine'' model has
been less popular than the ``blueberry'' version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have been cringing at the orange model,'' said Louis
Mazzucchelli, an Apple analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co. in
New York. ``This should get rid of those concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The new iBook (graphite in color) will sport 64 MB of RAM, a 6GB
hard drive and a 366 MHz processor. It is on shelves this week at a
cost of $1,800.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jobs, the company's chief executive, said Apple would
double the memory and disk size of the existing $1,599 tangerine
and blueberry iBook models without raising the price. The 300 MHz
processor also remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, who made the announcement in at a conference in Tokyo,
also introduced an upgraded Powerbook, the company's business-grade
laptop. The new machines will sport 500MHz and 400MHz processors at
$3,499 and $2,499, respectively. They will include high-speed
``firewire'' ports, with which users can transfer
professional-quality digital video to and from digital camcorders
or external hard drives, and built-in ``airport'' capability, with
which they can connect to the Internet wirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also announced a speed boost to its Power Mac G4 line. The
500MHz, 450MHz and 400MHz systems will be priced at $1,600 to
$3,500. Apple had bragged that the G4 had these speeds last year,
then had to trim the claims back by 50 MHz across the line because
of technical difficulties.

&HT;     ISRAELI COMPANY ACQUIRES DISTANCE-LEARNING SOFTWARE DEVELOPER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Stands for LEARNLINK)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DANIELLE T. FURFARO  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH GREENBUSH, N.Y. _ LearnLinc Corp., a North Greenbush
distance-learning software company, has announced that it is being
acquired by Gilat Communications for about $39 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   LearnLinc, one of the fastest growing software companies in the
Albany area, is the third company to be acquired in as many months
by the Israel-based company.
</P>
<P>
   When LearnLinc began negotiations with Gilat last month, the
local software company was only looking for venture capital,
according to Degerhan Usluel, the company's chief executive.
However, both sides quickly decided the companies should join
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that it made a lot of sense,'' Usluel said. ``It
will make us the strongest firm in the e-learning market in terms
of products, services and infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the acquisition, Gilat gains LearnLinc's learning
software, which enables an instructor and students to work together
on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw in LearnLinc an excellent group of product developers
who fit nicely into our overall strategic development,'' said Todd
Miller, vice president of business development at Gilat.
</P>
<P>
   The other companies acquired recently by Gilat were Utah-based
Allen Communications and Israel-based John Bryce Training, both of
which specialize in areas of distance-learning technology. Gilat
itself has pioneered distance learning by remote satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Gilat moved boldly in acquiring three companies in
such a short time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be an easy thing to digest,'' said Victor
Halpert, who analyzes Gilat for Salomon Smith Barney. ``But with
the proper management, it can be successful. Lots of traditional
CEOs wouldn't have made such a bold move.''
</P>
<P>
   LearnLinc will operate as a fully owned subsidiary of Gilat and
will remain in its North Greenbush office. It also plans to add
between 30 and 50 employees to its current base of 40 by the end of
the year. Companywide, Gilat has about 660 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1994, LearnLinc has facilitated on-line training for
many large U.S. corporations, including Aetna US Health Care,
Lucent Technologies and MCI WorldCom. Many colleges and
universities also use LearnLinc software.
</P>
<P>
   ``LearnLinc has been growing like crazy and were finding it hard
to keep up in terms of hiring people,'' said Jack Wilson,
LearnLinc's chairman and founder. ``This way, they will be able to
combine sales and marketing forces with the other divisions. It
will be one-stop shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger is expected to be finalized on Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Gilat Communications trades on the Nasdaq under the symbol
GICOF.

   MIAMI _ After three months of protests, political posturing and
nasty family squabbling, the case of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez heads to the hushed confines of a federal court here on
Tuesday(2/22).
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler will take up the question
of whether his court has jurisdiction over the boy and whether
Elian's Miami relatives _ who want him to remain in the United
States _ have any right to make claims on his behalf.

   Experts say the court hearing _ which could clear the way for
the boy to be returned to his father in Cuba _ comes none too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy has faced layer upon layer of stress,'' said Alan
Delamater, a child psychologist at the University of Miami. ``While
kids can be remarkably resilient, all in all I'd say there's a
significant toll on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found floating in an inner tube off the coast of Fort
Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day. His mother and 10 other people
drowned after their small boat capsized on an ill-fated trip from
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since his rescue, the boy has become the center of an
international tug-of-war, with the government Cuban President Fidel
Castro organizing massive rallies almost daily calling for the
boy's return to Cuba. In Miami, Cuban exiles _ not swayed by polls
showing most Americans favoring Elian's return _ have protested,
saying he should be kept here rather than sent back to an
impoverished future on the Communist island.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno upheld a decision
by federal immigration officials that Elian should be returned to
his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in Cuba. But Reno stopped short
of forcibly removing the boy from the Miami home of his
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who has cared for him since his
rescue from the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family then filed a federal lawsuit aimed at blocking
Reno's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's long-awaited hearing will take up a motion by
government lawyers to dismiss the case. Their primary argument is
that immigration decisions are a matter for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, and not the courts. They also contend the
Miami family has no legal standing because immigration officials
correctly ruled that Elian's father is the only one with the legal
right to speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the law is squarely behind the government's
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no question,'' said David Abraham, a
University of Miami law professor who specializes in immigration
matters. ``Immigration admissions decisions are not reviewable by
the courts. The law is clear and has been clear from the outset.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Miami family, however, argue that the boy should
be given the chance to apply for asylum in this country, and that
failing to do so denies him of his constitutional rights. They also
asked Hoeveler to honor a ruling by a Miami-Dade County family
court giving custody of Elian to Lazaro Gonzalez, or to appoint an
independent guardian to care for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has ignored the family court ruling, saying that
immigration matters are solely a federal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   If Hoeveler decides he has no jurisdiction in the case or the
Miami family has no legal standing, the family could appeal to the
11th Circuit Court in Atlanta. That process could take days, if not
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But if Hoeveler decides he has jurisdiction and the family has a
right to pursue the lawsuit, he would hold another hearing on the
merits of the case during the week of March 6.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the sparring over the boy has continued. Cuban
officials have charged that two of the great-uncles now caring for
Elian have been arrested for drunken driving, demonstrating their
lack of suitability to care for him.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel, has also written two letters to
Reno in recent weeks decrying the delays in the case, and asking
that the boy be moved to live with other Miami relatives who favor
sending him back to Cuba and allowing Cuban officials to visit the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has also repeatedly said he will not come to this
country to claim his son, and in his second letter to Reno said he
refuses to recognize the jurisdiction of U.S. courts over the
matter, dashing speculation that he might travel to Miami for the
court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives, meanwhile, have constructed a privacy
fence around their Little Havana home and asked that the media
scale back its constant coverage of the case. They have also
expressed outrage that one of Elian's grandmothers teased the boy
by biting him and unzipping his pants during a much-publicized
visit in early February.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, psychologists say Elian has suffered
enough trauma _ the loss of his mother, being left alone in the
ocean, the swarm of media following his every move _ to upset even
the most stable person.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface he may be doing well, but as far as the long
term, it's clear he will have a lot to deal with,'' said Wade Horn,
a child psychologist and founder of the National Fatherhood
Initiative, which promotes responsible fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern for him is what happens afterwards,'' Horn added.
``If he stays here, he could grow up with a tremendous sense of
guilt about not going back to his father. But if he goes, he may
come to resent losing the life he could've had here.''

   MIAMI _ After three months of protests, political posturing and
nasty family squabbling, the case of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez heads to the hushed confines of a federal court here on
Tuesday(2/22).
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler will take up the question
of whether his court has jurisdiction over the boy and whether
Elian's Miami relatives _ who want him to remain in the United
States _ have any right to make claims on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the court hearing _ which could clear the way for
the boy to be returned to his father in Cuba _ comes none too soon.

   FACES-EXHIBIT (New York) _ Everyone is cordially invited to a
reception at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It's a daily,
come-as-you-are affair, just a casual little party for friends you
haven't met. Or maybe you have met them. The faces certainly seem
familiar. The prettiest girl from high school is here, and that
smug 10-to-6'er she married. So is a distant, distant cousin, and a
barely remembered college chum, and even an old flame you'd prefer
to forget. And there are strangers who aren't really strangers.
Didn't you see that elderly gent in the subway and brush past that
unisex youth in the street? And who is that woman across the room
with the emerald necklace and stricken face? In fact, they are all
from another world, one that came and went 2,000 years ago.
Gathered together in a time-traveling exhibition titled ``Ancient
Faces: Mummy Portraits From Roman Egypt,'' they make a haunting
ensemble. By Holland Cotter.

 &HT;    CONGRESS URGED TO DEPORT ALIENS SUSPECTED OF TORTURE
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States should deport people responsible
for committing torture in their home countries, a congressional
panel was told Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, only aliens suspected of participating in genocide
may be excluded or deported.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., urged the House Judiciary subcommittee
on immigration to adopt his bill adding torture as a reason for
excluding or deporting aliens. A similar bill passed the Senate
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brutal criminals who have gone on violent rampages in Haiti,
Yugoslavia and Rwanda have been able to gain entry to the United
States through the same doors that we have opened to deserving
refugees,'' Foley said. ``We need to slam the door shut on these
thugs and rid our country of those who have already managed to make
their way here.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 7,000 human rights abusers may live in the United
States, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   He became interested in the problem after learning that Carl
Dorelien, a former Haitian paramilitary leader, lives in Port St.
Lucie, Fla., and won a $3.2 million lottery prize in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's bill also would shift responsibility for investigating
human rights abusers within the Justice Department from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to the Office of Special
Investigations, an agency that hunts down former Nazis living in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department supports broadening the reasons for which
human rights abusers may be deported, but opposes shifting the job
to the Office of Special Investigations.
</P>
<P>
   James Costello, an associate deputy attorney general, told the
panel that INS has extensive experience in monitoring modern human
rights abuses. In addition, he noted, INS has a wide network of
agents and immigration judges.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Krieger, president of International Educational
Missions, Inc., based in Boynton Beach, told the panel that INS has
done a poor job of removing human rights abusers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What of Rwandan war criminals, Cambodian, Sudanese, Somalian,
Congolese, Indonesian or Ethiopian?'' Krieger asked. ``What of
Haitian, Chilean, or Argentinean perpetrators of torture and crimes
against humanity? Why have any of them been allowed to enter the
United States and why have they been allowed to stay?''
</P>
<P>
   Foley said the Office of Special Investigations has a track
record of hunting down human rights abusers but that its function
is winding down as death claims more former Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   But Costello said the OSI's expertise is narrowly confined to
the Holocaust and does not extend to modern human rights abusers.

 &HT;    AS DEADLINE LOOMS, U.S. AND MICROSOFT SEEK DEAL
 &HT;    670&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates signaled Thursday
that bargaining on a settlement of the federal antitrust case
against the company had reached a crucial phase.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said on NBC's ``Today'' show that he had joined Steve
Ballmer, the company's newly named chief executive officer, in
``spending considerable time'' on seeking an accord ``because we
think it would be in everyone's interest if we could put this
behind us and get it settled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting all of our creativity into that,'' Gates said.
``We've got to make sure that consumers are still going to have the
benefits of our innovation,'' he added, but ``we're very
open-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have begun meeting face to face in settlement
talks at the Lawyer's Club in Chicago, and the negotiations now
include chief government litigator David Boies.
</P>
<P>
   The developments come just days before both sides are to appear
before U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson on Tuesday for
arguments on whether Microsoft broke antitrust laws by misusing its
Windows operating system to increase its share of other personal
computer software markets, particularly Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson already has issued ``findings of fact'' that Microsoft
does have an operating system monopoly, and has leveraged that
monopoly to stifle competition and harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   If he finds those actions broke the law, Microsoft would be
subject to penalties, possibly including a breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's newfound open-mindedness toward accepting a solution
that falls short of a full breakup is also evident in recent
e-mails to congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the company said it was willing to accept
``common-sense'' curbs on its business practices as the price of a
settlement. But any remedy that splits up the world's most valued
company would be ``extreme and unwarranted ...a regulatory death
sentence while the high-tech economy whizzes by on Internet time,''
one message argued.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after handing down his findings of fact, Jackson tapped
Judge Richard Posner, chief of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
7th Circuit, to informally broker a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Posner had been meeting with the government team each Monday and
Microsoft lawyers each Tuesday, but face-to-face talks began in
earnest this week, a sure sign that progress was being made.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers think a settlement might be imminent, or at least
that enough progress can be made for Jackson to postpone Tuesday's
oral arguments on the conclusions of law, which would lead directly
to a final ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there really is a delay due to the mediation by Judge
Posner, it must mean that they are very close to a settlement,''
University of Baltimore School of Law professor Bob Lande, who has
followed the case closely, said. ``If they are just talking,
putting forth the same old far-apart positions, they would just go
ahead with the oral arguments on the 22nd.''
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances, the government holds the high cards and need
not accept a weak settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Jackson's earlier findings, Gates and Ballmer face the
prospect that the flow of innovation, Microsoft professed stock in
trade, could be disrupted by the company's continuing legal woes,
including the prospect of widespread private civil suits.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department remains under considerable pressure
to settle as well.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than offering his backing, President Clinton has declared
his neutrality in the landmark suit, even though the officials in
charge of the prosecution _ Attorney General Janet Reno and Joel
Klein, who heads the Justice Department's antitrust division _ are
his appointees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without expressing an opinion on that case one way or the
other, I think what I favor is an American economy where people who
have good ideas and new messages they want to get out ought to have
some way to do that, if they can generate a following,'' Clinton
said in a CNN interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Klein has zealously sought to create an anti-Microsoft consensus
among technology industry leaders. But he has found few, if any,
top-level takers.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-December, Klein secretly assembled a blue-chip roster of
Microsoft critics at the Silicon Valley headquarters of Intuit.
They included such luminaries as Intuit's Bill Campbell, Sun
Microsystems' Scott McNealy, Oracle's Ray Lane, Netscape's Jim
Barksdale and Novell's Eric Schmidt, who joined by speakerphone
from his Utah home.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting failed to produce a joint statement. Moreover,
several other firms that have been stung by Microsoft's past
practices _ notably IBM, Intel and Gateway _ have also kept their
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Klein and Boies have been striving to keep the 19
states and the District of Columbia _ who, by Jackson's order, are
tightly joined to the case _ walking down the same settlement path.
</P>
<P>
   Several of these state attorneys general take only a scant
interest in the proceedings. But others _ notably Connecticut's
Richard Blumenthal, Iowa's Tom Miller and New York's Eliot Spitzer,
all Democrats _ have taken a harsh line.
</P>
<P>
   One possible defector is Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery,
a Republican. Writing recently in the Columbus Dispatch, David
Mayer, a professor of law at local Capital University, reported
that Montgomery ``is said to have serious qualms about the Justice
Department's plan to break up Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   But Klein's nuanced approach also has gained a fair share of
academic defenders. One of them is Robert Litan, director of the
economic studies at the Brookings Institution and a former deputy
assistant attorney general in the antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   As Litan sees it, the sole reasonable objection to the various
breakup options is that they could fracture the de facto global
Windows standard for personal computers powered by Intel
processors.

 &HT;    AS DEADLINE LOOMS, U.S. AND MICROSOFT SEEK DEAL
 &HT;    670&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates signaled Thursday
that bargaining on a settlement of the federal antitrust case
against the company had reached a crucial phase.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said on NBC's ``Today'' show that he had joined Steve
Ballmer, the company's newly named chief executive officer, in
``spending considerable time'' on seeking an accord ``because we
think it would be in everyone's interest if we could put this
behind us and get it settled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting all of our creativity into that,'' Gates said.
``We've got to make sure that consumers are still going to have the
benefits of our innovation,'' he added, but ``we're very
open-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have begun meeting face to face in settlement
talks at the Lawyer's Club in Chicago, and the negotiations now
include chief government litigator David Boies.
</P>
<P>
   The developments come just days before both sides are to appear
before U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson on Tuesday for
arguments on whether Microsoft broke antitrust laws by misusing its
Windows operating system to increase its share of other personal
computer software markets, particularly Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson already has issued ``findings of fact'' that Microsoft
does have an operating system monopoly, and has leveraged that
monopoly to stifle competition and harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   If he finds those actions broke the law, Microsoft would be
subject to penalties, possibly including a breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's newfound open-mindedness toward accepting a solution
that falls short of a full breakup is also evident in recent
e-mails to congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the company said it was willing to accept
``common-sense'' curbs on its business practices as the price of a
settlement. But any remedy that splits up the world's most valued
company would be ``extreme and unwarranted ...a regulatory death
sentence while the high-tech economy whizzes by on Internet time,''
one message argued.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after handing down his findings of fact, Jackson tapped
Judge Richard Posner, chief of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
7th Circuit, to informally broker a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Posner had been meeting with the government team each Monday and
Microsoft lawyers each Tuesday, but face-to-face talks began in
earnest this week, a sure sign that progress was being made.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers think a settlement might be imminent, or at least
that enough progress can be made for Jackson to postpone Tuesday's
oral arguments on the conclusions of law, which would lead directly
to a final ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there really is a delay due to the mediation by Judge
Posner, it must mean that they are very close to a settlement,''
University of Baltimore School of Law professor Bob Lande, who has
followed the case closely, said. ``If they are just talking,
putting forth the same old far-apart positions, they would just go
ahead with the oral arguments on the 22nd.''
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances, the government holds the high cards and need
not accept a weak settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Jackson's earlier findings, Gates and Ballmer face the
prospect that the flow of innovation, Microsoft professed stock in
trade, could be disrupted by the company's continuing legal woes,
including the prospect of widespread private civil suits.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department remains under considerable pressure
to settle as well.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than offering his backing, President Clinton has declared
his neutrality in the landmark suit, even though the officials in
charge of the prosecution _ Attorney General Janet Reno and Joel
Klein, who heads the Justice Department's antitrust division _ are
his appointees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without expressing an opinion on that case one way or the
other, I think what I favor is an American economy where people who
have good ideas and new messages they want to get out ought to have
some way to do that, if they can generate a following,'' Clinton
said in a CNN interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Klein has zealously sought to create an anti-Microsoft consensus
among technology industry leaders. But he has found few, if any,
top-level takers.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-December, Klein secretly assembled a blue-chip roster of
Microsoft critics at the Silicon Valley headquarters of Intuit.
They included such luminaries as Intuit's Bill Campbell, Sun
Microsystems' Scott McNealy, Oracle's Ray Lane, Netscape's Jim
Barksdale and Novell's Eric Schmidt, who joined by speakerphone
from his Utah home.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting failed to produce a joint statement. Moreover,
several other firms that have been stung by Microsoft's past
practices _ notably IBM, Intel and Gateway _ have also kept their
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Klein and Boies have been striving to keep the 19
states and the District of Columbia _ who, by Jackson's order, are
tightly joined to the case _ walking down the same settlement path.
</P>
<P>
   Several of these state attorneys general take only a scant
interest in the proceedings. But others _ notably Connecticut's
Richard Blumenthal, Iowa's Tom Miller and New York's Eliot Spitzer,
all Democrats _ have taken a harsh line.
</P>
<P>
   One possible defector is Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery,
a Republican. Writing recently in the Columbus Dispatch, David
Mayer, a professor of law at local Capital University, reported
that Montgomery ``is said to have serious qualms about the Justice
Department's plan to break up Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   But Klein's nuanced approach also has gained a fair share of
academic defenders. One of them is Robert Litan, director of the
economic studies at the Brookings Institution and a former deputy
assistant attorney general in the antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   As Litan sees it, the sole reasonable objection to the various
breakup options is that they could fracture the de facto global
Windows standard for personal computers powered by Intel
processors.
</P>
<P>
   Litan adds: ``In the short run, this is highly doubtful.''
Multiple ``operating systems companies would have strong incentives
to use the common (programming hooks) of the current Windows _ and
the new Windows 2000 _ so that each would have a full range of
applications programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the longer run,'' Litan concedes, ``standards might
diverge, but it is through that competitive process that innovation
occurs _ the major theme of Jackson's opinion.''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``COLORS OF THE MOUNTAIN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Da Chen (Random House, $25)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is that rarity in these times, a truly marvelous book. Da
Chen was born in 1962, in a tiny town in southern China, and his
memoir begins with his childhood stories of life during the
Cultural Revolution. Chen's grandfather had been a wealthy
landlord, reason enough to incur relentless mistreatment for him
and his family (he lived with Chen's parents and their five
children), as well as the loss of their house, land and most
possessions. Food was scarce, humiliation was waiting around every
corner, and the future seemed without promise. And yet, the view
through young Chen's eyes is remarkably cheerful, made so by his
curiosity and pugnacity and by his parents' enduring dignity in the
face of their dreadfully altered lives. This big-hearted and
sometimes even humorous story is written in simple, evocative
prose, and it ends as Chen leaves for college in Beijing. It's a
moving moment, but not the book's first _ we were misty before we
got past the dedication. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE BRETHREN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John Grisham (Doubleday, $27.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to mock a rich man, but we must give Grisham credit:
He doesn't take the advance and run. His new novel is inventive and
unpredictable, and very different from any of his previous books.
It focuses on three judges who are incarcerated in a
minimum-security prison for sins ranging from tax evasion to
driving drunkenly over two hikers in Yellowstone. In jail, they
preside over a ``court'' in which inmates file grievances against
each other (witnesses are expected to lie, and verdicts are quick
and without appeal). The judges also run a mail scheme in which
they pose as young, nubile inmates, bait wealthy men on the
outside, then blackmail them for the gay sex talk in their letters.
Trouble brews when they target Aaron Lake, U.S. congressman from
Arizona and the presidential candidate backed by the powerful
director of the CIA. Everyone's sleazy here, and the efforts at
damage control are complex and entertaining. When this one lands on
the bestseller lists, the honor will be deserved.  &QL; 
 &UR; ``MATCH WITS WITH MENSA'' &QL; 
 &UR; (Perseus, $19.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We have found our omnipotence, and it is in vocabulary _ we will
stomp all challengers into the ground. It was the only subject in
this book at which we showed any prowess, but thank God there was
something. The editors say they have assembled more than 800
puzzles. We were struck by the inordinate amount of yakking that
precedes them. You must wade through much discussion of a category
_ trivia, analogies, logic etc. _ and a sometimes lengthy list of
acknowledgments before you get to the tests themselves, which makes
us think that Mensa members need rest between bouts of mental
exertion. We were also struck by how much Mensa members _ to be
one, you must score in the top two percent of the population on any
standard intelligence test _ like to look at themselves in the
mental mirror. But we digress. Here is what the editors consider to
be a ``warm-up'' trivia question: ``Domenikos Theotocopoulus is
better known as who?'' The answer is El Greco, the painter. We
looked it up.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE WHITE DEATH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By McKay Jenkins (Random House, $23.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins calls John McPhee his mentor, and you can see McPhee's
influence in the way Jenkins comes at his subject _ avalanches _
from all sides. His main path is the story of five young climbers
who died in an avalanche on Mount Cleveland in Montana's Glacier
National Park in 1969. He mixes the personal stories of those young
men with fascinating information about snow, mountains, rescues and
survival. He shows us how terrifying it is to be caught under snow,
not knowing which way is up (the only way to tell, he says, is to
spit _ whichever way it falls, you should dig, if you can move, in
the opposite direction), how you increase your chances for survival
if you remember to shut your mouth (many victims are found with
their mouths full of snow), how your chances plummet if you are not
rescued within minutes. Dogs have found people alive in 15 feet of
snow, sniffing them out by their individual scents. Each living
person smells different, Jenkins says. All corpses smell the same.

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A'' CATEGORY 
 RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ He offers campaign finance reform. He does town
hall meetings to get close to voters. He comes off as a political
pugilist. He says he is a reformer who challenges the establishment
and the status quo. And he is an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Is this Arizona Sen. John McCain, candidate for the Republican
presidential nomination? No, it is Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who
has tried to transform his campaign into the same bus-riding
insurgency movement that has propelled McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the ``compassionate conservative?'' Now Bush is a
``reformer with a record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than emphasize his own strengths, he's trying to copy
McCain,'' said Jack Pitney, a government professor at Claremont
McKenna College in California. ``Next thing you know, he'll be
talking about his days as a prisoner of war.'' (Bush wasn't, McCain
was during the Vietnam conflict.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain face each other Saturday in South Carolina's
Republican primary, where the two candidates have about an equal
amount of support among GOP voters, according to recent polls. A
McCain win in South Carolina, combined with his 19-point victory in
New Hampshire on Feb. 1, could weaken nationwide support for Bush
and produce a wild and even nastier fight for delegates in
California and New York _ two voter-rich states that hold primaries
on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign says its message has been consistent
throughout the primary, although it acknowledges that Bush recently
has changed tactics and is getting closer to voters through a
series of town hall meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Governor Bush is trying to do is just hammer away at the
substantive issues and talk about his record and talk about his
results,'' said campaign spokeswoman Alixe Mattingly.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been a change in Bush over the past two weeks,
political analysts and campaign strategists say. While Bush and
McCain agree with each other on many issues, McCain's message of
challenging the Washington elite is hitting a responsive cord with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Tuesday's debate with McCain and former State
Department official Alan Keyes, Bush announced his own plan to
overhaul the way national campaigns are financed, perhaps trying to
capture the one issue most closely associated with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has followed up with an advertisement saying his plan is
``real reform'' compared with McCain's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   During the New Hampshire primary, McCain boasted he attended 114
town hall meetings, sometimes talking into the evening on any
subject that came up. Bush, however, was criticized for coming to
the state too late and not paying closer attention to rank-and-file
voters.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Bush campaign is touting one-on-one meetings with
voters in Florence, Conway and Litchfield, S.C. In the past, Bush
has confined his public appearances to orchestrated rallies and
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush hasn't abandoned his plan to cut taxes by $483
billion _ nearly double McCain's proposal _ Bush is no longer
exclusively pushing the cut in his advertising. In polls across the
country, voters are saying they believe using the federal surplus
to protect Social Security and Medicare are more important than
giving taxpayers a break.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign has highlighted protecting Social Security and
Medicare in promoting its tax cut, and now Bush has shifted to a
more balanced message in his advertising and during debates. The
Bush campaign may be taking a cue from the recent polls and from
the failed 1996 campaign of Bob Dole, who offered a large tax cut
to little avail.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is punctuating these tactical moves with a more aggressive
personal attitude. During the debate Tuesday in South Carolina, he
jabbed his finger, interrupted McCain and Keyes, scoffed, and tried
to dominate the conversation about as much as Keyes did. McCain,
who is trying to soften his image a bit, was more passive.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have noticed Bush's change in tone and message over the
past few weeks, and it looks a lot like McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign has for at least a year been on cruise
control, with every indication he was going to get the
nomination,'' said Dennis W. Johnson, associate dean of the
graduate school of political management at George Washington
University in Washington, D.C. ``It just looked like everything was
clear sailing and the need to have a really clear, sharp message
wasn't there until McCain came along. I think what you've seen is a
redefinition to make Bush seem more like McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Since South Carolina has an open primary, meaning that Democrats
can vote in the Republican election, McCain could benefit from
appealing to the outsiders. It has been his strategy all along:
Appeal to the independent-minded voters in New Hampshire and do the
same in South Carolina. Then use the momentum to win California.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   California Secretary of State Bill Jones, the state's highest
ranking Republican officeholder, cited McCain's ability to attract
Democrats and independents when he defected from the Bush camp this
week and endorsed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to tell if McCain's message will sell in
California. Unlike South Carolina, only votes from registered
Republicans count in the selection of delegates for the national
convention. That favors Bush, although McCain claims to have
convinced 30,000 supporters to register as Republicans and vote on
March 7.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign, meanwhile, continues to paint the Arizona
senator as an outsider, despite his 17 years in Congress and his
chairmanship of the Senate Commerce Committee. McCain doesn't mind
so much when U.S. senators and others speak ill of him, or when
Bush talks about being against the establishment and then touts
endorsements from the nation's governors and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the worst thing the establishment can say about John McCain
is the establishment doesn't like John McCain,'' said
communications director Dan Schnur, ``then we'll do OK.''

 &HT;    NEARLY 40 PERCENT OF HISPANICS HAVE NO HEALTH INSURANCE
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The number of uninsured Hispanics has nearly
doubled over the last decade to nearly 40 percent, a new study
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The study sponsored by the Commonwealth Fund, a private
foundation researching health issues, found that more than 11
million Hispanics under 65 are uninsured. Of those, 9 million live
in a family in which at least one member is employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the past year almost half of uninsured Hispanics have
not seen a doctor, filled a prescription, or received recommended
medical tests or treatment because of cost,'' said Karen Davis,
president of the Commonwealth Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-fourth of the nation's 44 million uninsured people
are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of uninsured Hispanics surpasses that of white adults,
about 15 percent, or black Americans, about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   California, Florida, New York and Texas, all states with large
concentrations of Hispanics, accounted for nearly 73 percent of all
uninsured Hispanics. Nearly one-third of all uninsured Hispanics
live in California and nearly one-fourth live in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of employer-sponsored insurance coverage is the primary
reason for the increase in the numbers of uninsured Hispanics, the
study reported. About 43 percent of Hispanic workers are covered by
insurance programs offered by their employer, compared with 64
percent of workers nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the Hispanic workers surveyed reported that their
employers did not sponsor an insurance plan, and 25 percent said
they were ineligible for the insurance plans that were offered
because they did not work enough hours per week or were still in
the waiting period for eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics today comprise an increasingly vital share of the
nation's work force, a share that is certain to increase in the
future. Yet they appear not to be receiving the same benefits as
other working Americans,'' said Cathy Schoen, vice president of
research and evaluation for the Commonwealth Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that Hispanics who were uninsured faced
financial difficulties. More than two-thirds of uninsured Hispanics
reported trouble paying their medical bills or have been contacted
by a collection agency about medical expenses.

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K'' CATEGORY 
 RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``COLORS OF THE MOUNTAIN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Da Chen (Random House, $25)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is that rarity in these times, a truly marvelous book. Da
Chen was born in 1962, in a tiny town in southern China, and his
memoir begins with his childhood stories of life during the
Cultural Revolution. Chen's grandfather had been a wealthy
landlord, reason enough to incur relentless mistreatment for him
and his family (he lived with Chen's parents and their five
children), as well as the loss of their house, land and most
possessions. Food was scarce, humiliation was waiting around every
corner, and the future seemed without promise. And yet, the view
through young Chen's eyes is remarkably cheerful, made so by his
curiosity and pugnacity and by his parents' enduring dignity in the
face of their dreadfully altered lives. This big-hearted and
sometimes even humorous story is written in simple, evocative
prose, and it ends as Chen leaves for college in Beijing. It's a
moving moment, but not the book's first _ we were misty before we
got past the dedication. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE BRETHREN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John Grisham (Doubleday, $27.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to mock a rich man, but we must give Grisham credit:
He doesn't take the advance and run. His new novel is inventive and
unpredictable, and very different from any of his previous books.
It focuses on three judges who are incarcerated in a
minimum-security prison for sins ranging from tax evasion to
driving drunkenly over two hikers in Yellowstone. In jail, they
preside over a ``court'' in which inmates file grievances against
each other (witnesses are expected to lie, and verdicts are quick
and without appeal). The judges also run a mail scheme in which
they pose as young, nubile inmates, bait wealthy men on the
outside, then blackmail them for the gay sex talk in their letters.
Trouble brews when they target Aaron Lake, U.S. congressman from
Arizona and the presidential candidate backed by the powerful
director of the CIA. Everyone's sleazy here, and the efforts at
damage control are complex and entertaining. When this one lands on
the bestseller lists, the honor will be deserved.  &QL; 
 &UR; ``MATCH WITS WITH MENSA'' &QL; 
 &UR; (Perseus, $19.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We have found our omnipotence, and it is in vocabulary _ we will
stomp all challengers into the ground. It was the only subject in
this book at which we showed any prowess, but thank God there was
something. The editors say they have assembled more than 800
puzzles. We were struck by the inordinate amount of yakking that
precedes them. You must wade through much discussion of a category
_ trivia, analogies, logic etc. _ and a sometimes lengthy list of
acknowledgments before you get to the tests themselves, which makes
us think that Mensa members need rest between bouts of mental
exertion. We were also struck by how much Mensa members _ to be
one, you must score in the top two percent of the population on any
standard intelligence test _ like to look at themselves in the
mental mirror. But we digress. Here is what the editors consider to
be a ``warm-up'' trivia question: ``Domenikos Theotocopoulus is
better known as who?'' The answer is El Greco, the painter. We
looked it up.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE WHITE DEATH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By McKay Jenkins (Random House, $23.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins calls John McPhee his mentor, and you can see McPhee's
influence in the way Jenkins comes at his subject _ avalanches _
from all sides. His main path is the story of five young climbers
who died in an avalanche on Mount Cleveland in Montana's Glacier
National Park in 1969. He mixes the personal stories of those young
men with fascinating information about snow, mountains, rescues and
survival. He shows us how terrifying it is to be caught under snow,
not knowing which way is up (the only way to tell, he says, is to
spit _ whichever way it falls, you should dig, if you can move, in
the opposite direction), how you increase your chances for survival
if you remember to shut your mouth (many victims are found with
their mouths full of snow), how your chances plummet if you are not
rescued within minutes. Dogs have found people alive in 15 feet of
snow, sniffing them out by their individual scents. Each living
person smells different, Jenkins says. All corpses smell the same.

<P>
   It was almost inevitable that Tom Hanks' new movie earn an Oscar
nomination as Best Picture _ it's a Stephen King adaptation by
writer/director Frank Darabont, the team that created the classic
``The Shawshank Redemption,'' and, well, it stars Hanks, winner of
two Best Actor Oscars in the 1990s. Hanks talks with New York-based
free-lance writer Ian Spelling about the new film, his reaction to
the Oscar talk, the challenges of creating distinct characters when
he himself has become so well-known and what lies ahead for an
actor who, at 43, has already reached the peak of his profession.

<P>
   Al Pacino has made a career of playing roles torn from the
headlines of the day, from ``Dog Day Afternoon'' and ``The
Godfather'' to ``Serpico'' and ``City Hall.'' Now he's tackling
what may be his most explosive subject ever _ a real-life look at
the tobacco controversy _ in the Oscar-nominated ``The Insider.''
Pacino talks with Chicago-based free-lance writer Cindy Pearlman
about the new film, his role as a real-life ``60 Minutes''
producer, the challenges of approaching a subject on which his
audience is likely to have strong, preconceived ideas and why it
doesn't bother him that ``60 Minutes'' stalwart Mike Wallace has
denounced the film. (slugged:

<P>
   Nominated for an Oscar as Best Actor for his performance as
imprisoned boxer Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter in ``The Hurricane,''
Denzel Washington makes no apologies for taking his work seriously.
Whether it was training relentlessly to make himself convincing as
a professional boxer or immersing himself in the history of
Carter's case, Washington went the extra mile to hone his
performance. The actor talks with Hollywood-based writer Ivor Davis
about the movie, the challenge of playing a real-life person who
remains alive and active, what he thinks Carter's story has to say
to Americans of all colors today and why he believes that he
himself only narrowly escaped a life of crime and prison. (slugged:

   Her performance in ``The End of the Affair'' has won Julianne
Moore an Oscar nomination as Best Actress, capping a busy year
which also saw her co-starring in ``An Ideal Husband,'' ``A Map of

writer Ivor Davis about the movie, the challenge she faced, as an
American, playing an Englishwoman opposite British star Ralph
Fiennes and how she approached the movie's torrid sex scenes.

   Hilary Swank has done soap opera in ``Beverly Hills 90210,''
shown her athletic prowess in the feature film ``The Next Karate
Kid'' and faced evil in the original film version of ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer,'' but her latest film is easily her most
challenging _ and has earned her first Oscar nomination. ``Boys
Don't Cry'' casts her as Brandon Teena, nee Teena Brandon, a woman
who disguised herself as a man and began a new life for herself in
small-town Nebraska, until hatred and intolerance brought this
real-life story to a tragic ending. Swank talks with New York-based
free-lance writer Ian Spelling about the film, the unique
challenges of playing a woman playing a man, her own experiences
with intolerance and why she thinks Brandon Teena's story had to be
told. (slugged:

   Michael Caine has never played an American before _ the accent
took him weeks of coaching to master _ but it was worth it to make
``The Cider House Rules,'' he says. The film casts him as a kindly
doctor who runs an orphanage, and also performs abortions on the
side to prevent unwanted children from being born. Caine talks with
Chicago-based free-lance writer Cindy Pearlman about the new film,
the horrendous experiences from his own childhood which drew him to
the role, why he's happier as an actor now that he's aged out of
leading-man roles and why he doesn't want to talk about the Oscar
chances for his performance in ``Cider House Rules.'' (slugged:

&HT;     STUDENTS CALL FOR DIVERSITY IN ADMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Student leaders at the University of
California at Berkeley have joined student body presidents at other
Pac-10 Conference schools to urge their campuses to increase
minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a resolution passed by the Pac-10 Student Body
President's Conference at UC-Berkeley two weeks ago, student
leaders on Wednesday called a ``day of action'' to make diversity a
priority for campus administrators.
</P>
<P>
   At a cold and wet Sproul Plaza, Patrick Campbell, president of
the campus' Associated Students governing body, addressed barely a
score of students and supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But he said no other campus held more significant meaning for
the affirmative action movement than Berkeley, flagship of the
University of California, which in 1995 banned the use of race and
ethnicity in admissions, and some say, triggered a nationwide
affirmative action rollback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a second-generation Bear and I love this university very
much,'' Campbell, 22, said, referring to Berkeley by its mascot.
``I believe in this university's motto, 'Let there be light,' and
its creed, 'Excellence through diversity,' and I will fight to keep
this university in line with its mission, motto and creed.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind him were rows and rows of empty plastic chairs _
symbolic, Campbell said, of the minorities who are n0t enrolled at
Berkeley because of the policy against admissions based on race.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1999, blacks, Hispanics and American Indians made
up 13.6 percent of new freshmen, up from 11.2 percent the previous
year, but well below the 21.5 percent in 1997 _ the last year for
which race and ethnicity were used as a factor in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   UC-Berkeley Chancellor Robert Berdahl has expressed support for
repealing the university's affirmative action ban, but UC regents
have thus far not considered such action.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley news conference coincided with similar activities
at the University of Washington, Washington State University, the
University of Arizona, Arizona State University, the University of
Southern California and the University of Oregon.

HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE SEEKS HALT IN ANTHRAX VACCINATIONS FOR MILITARY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)  (rk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House subcommittee Thursday released a scalding
critique on the Pentagon's effort to vaccinate American troops
against the biological agent anthrax, saying the program relies on
incomplete, outdated science and suffers from poor planning.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing its report, the subcommittee called on the Pentagon
to suspend the vaccination program until questions about its
effectiveness and adverse side effects are answered. Acknowledging
intelligence warnings of the possibility of an attack with anthrax,
it also recommended the Pentagon speed up research for a safer
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by the naticEP{ security subcommittee of the House's
Committee on Government Reform, represents another blow to the
Pentagon's anthrax program, which has faced delays, cost overruns
and occasional resistance from service members.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have repeatedly defended the vaccinations as
a safe, effective way to protect American troops from a biological
weapons attack using the deadly bacteria. In December, however, the
Pentagon was forced to halt new vaccinations because of problems at
the vaccine's manufacturer, causing further delays.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has said only a few hundred people in the military
have balked at the shots, but the instances have sometimes been
embarrassing. Only this week, the Air Force backed off its plans to
court-martial a major for refusing to take the shots and decided to
handle the case by an administrative hearing instead. And early in
1999, an airman with an untarnished record left the service under
``other than honorable conditions'' for refusing to take the
anthrax vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-page report released Thursday, the product of a year-long
review, could give momentum to efforts in Congress to force a halt
to the vaccinations. In the wake of growing protests from service
members, several House members have proposed separate bills that
would make the program voluntary or suspend it entirely until the
National Institutes of Health completed a study.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's development was the latest in a controversy that had
its beginnings in 1997, when Secretary of Defense William Cohen,
alarmed by reports that at least 10 countries have the ability to
make anthrax weapons, announced that he was ordering all 2.4
million active-duty and reserve troops to have the vaccinations.
They began a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is a naturally occurring bacterium that infects cattle
and sheep. When produced as dry spores, it can be incorporated into
one of the deadliest biological agents, capable of causing death
within days of being inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   Although no country has ever used anthrax in battle, the
Pentagon says that 10 countries, including Iraq and North Korea,
have the ability to make biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked early on that this might actually be a solution,''
said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., who joined three other Republicans
in releasing the report. ``But the more you dig into this the more
you realize this is more of a political solution than a substantive
medical solution to the question of chemical and biological
technology.''

   FACES-EXHIBIT (New York) _ Everyone is cordially invited to a
reception at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It's a daily,
come-as-you-are affair, just a casual little party for friends you
haven't met. Or maybe you have met them. The faces certainly seem
familiar. The prettiest girl from high school is here, and that
smug 10-to-6'er she married. So is a distant, distant cousin, and a
barely remembered college chum, and even an old flame you'd prefer
to forget. And there are strangers who aren't really strangers.
Didn't you see that elderly gent in the subway and brush past that
unisex youth in the street? And who is that woman across the room
with the emerald necklace and stricken face? In fact, they are all
from another world, one that came and went 2,000 years ago.
Gathered together in a time-traveling exhibition titled ``Ancient
Faces: Mummy Portraits From Roman Egypt,'' they make a haunting
ensemble. By Holland Cotter.

&HT;     OPPONENTS OF PROPOSED BAN ON GAY MARRIAGES LAUNCH TV ATTACK ON
THE MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By CAROL NESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Opponents of a ballot initiative to ban gay
marriages in California launched a TV ad campaign this week taking
on state Sen. Pete Knight, whose name the measure bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete Knight, the California politician behind Proposition 22,
may not like it that his son is gay. But he shouldn't make us vote
on his private problem ,'' says the ad. It began airing in
Sacramento Tuesday and in Los Angeles Wednesday and will hit the
San Francisco Bay area next week.
</P>
<P>
   Another 30-second ad by the No on Knight campaign takes a softer
approach, showing a photo montage of children and their parents and
asking, ``What if your child, or the child of someone you know,
turns out to be gay? Do you still want the best for them?'' The two
ads are the No on Knight campaign's answer to pro-Prop. 22 ads that
have been airing for almost four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, sponsored by Knight, a Palmdale, Calif.,
Republican, and conservative religious forces, would define
marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman - as
California law already does - and deny recognition of same-sex
marriages from any state that might legalize them in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Prop. 22 campaign also unveiled two new ads this week
that reinforce its message that voters must approve the measure if
they want to show their support for family and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The backers' first ad weeks ago was a direct appeal to Latino
voters, who may make up 16 percent of the electorate in the March 7
primary.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new ads depicts an African-American elementary school
teacher and appeals directly to parents and teachers about what
they want for their children. The second shows an elderly woman
going through mementos in her attic while she reminisces about her
own wedding day and talks about ``the way marriage has always
been.''
</P>
<P>
   The No on Knight campaign noted that state Superintendent of
Schools Delaine Eastin, the California Teachers Association and the
California Federation of Teachers have come out against Prop. 22.
</P>
<P>
   No on Knight campaign aides say they hope their TV ads will turn
public sentiment against the initiative, which polls have
consistently shown to be ahead with a majority of California voters
just three weeks before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the ads attempt to take the focus off the question of
whether gays should marry and to redefine the issue as one of
fairness, safety and non-discrimination, according to Ann Crigler,
director of the Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the highly charged, emotional feelings surrounding gay
marriage, I think it's probably wise for them not to take it on
directly,'' said Crigler, a professor with a specialty in political
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to shift the debate away from the way the Yes
on 22 people have framed it, which is to protect marriage, and
toward a question of treating people equally and fairly and
protecting people so there won't be acts of violence against
them,'' Crigler added.
</P>
<P>
   The No on Knight ad featuring the children says Prop. 22 ``could
increase anti-gay violence and (would) be used by extremists in the
Legislature to discriminate against gay people.'' The one that
takes on Pete Knight acknowledges that ``most people don't support
gay marriage'' but calls the initiative ``just more government
interference'' in people's private lives.
</P>
<P>
   Targeting Knight directly could prove to be a risky move,
Crigler said. Knight, the conservative senator whose son David is
gay and opposes his father's initiative, failed three times to get
the Legislature to pass a gay marriage ban before taking it to
state voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bringing a very personal family matter into the public
domain _ and in some ways they (the measure's opponents) are asking
that people not do that,'' Crigler said. ``So it could potentially
backfire on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Yes on 22 ads keep their agenda very narrowly focused,
she said. And using children and an elderly woman to deliver their
message is a shrewd move, she added.

   The irony is sweet. The smell of the potato plant could spell
the end for the dreaded Colorado beetle, which ravages millions of
dollars' worth of potato crops every year. Using powerful aromas
extracted from potato leaves, researchers in the UniS intend to
lure the insects to their death.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Dickens and his colleagues at the U.S. Agricultural
Research Service's field station in Beltsville, Md., have isolated
six compounds from spud leaves which draw Colorado beetles to their
meal. By measuring the strength of signals from electrodes
implanted in the beetle's antennae they screened for the most
active substances.
</P>
<P>
   The team then prepared a variety of mixtures of these substances
to see which blend worked best.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been an attractant for the Colorado beetle
before, so we're looking at something brand new,'' Dickens said.
</P>
<P>
   In experiments in the potato fields of Maine last summer, the
researchers found blends of two or three leaf substances which
worked well. The most successful blends all contained a volatile
leaf odor called (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate. ``We captured three
times as many insects in baited as in unbaited traps,'' says
Dickens. He expects the results to be published in the journal
Agricultural and Forest Entomology.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the researchers plan to try a ``push-pull''
approach. Working with the ARS team, Randy Alford of the University
of Maine has discovered that Colorado beetles detest limonin, a
bitter substance found in orange peel. Greenhouse experiments this
summer showed that beetles repelled by potatoes treated with
limonin are more likely to be attracted by the baited traps.
</P>
<P>
   An additional bonus was the discovery that the leaf odor
(Z)-3-hexen-1-ol attracts predatory insects which kill the beetles
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Colorado beetle bites the plant, that's released from
the wound site, attracting predators,'' Dickensm says. The
predators it attracts include the two-spotted stink bug (Perillus
bioculatus) and the spined soldier bug (Podisus maculiventris),
which pierce the body of the beetle and suck it dry.
</P>
<P>
   New weapons against the Colorado beetle are desperately needed,
according to Hans Vissen, an entomologist specializing in the
beetles at Plant Research International, a company in Wageningen,
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, the problem is so bad they can hardly grow potatoes
any more,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   John Pickett of the Institute of Arable Crops Research in
Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, says he is surpised these attractants
are so effective, because the same chemicals are produced by other
plants. Different proportions of attractants might let insects
discriminate between plants, he says. ``Maybe there's a blend which
tells the beetle that the plant is a potato.'' &QL;

   Plutonium from nuclear bombs exploded underground by India has
polluted Pakistan's nuclear test site 800 kilometers away,
according to sources in U.S. intelligence. If true, India has
breached its commitment to the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty, which outlaws explosions that contaminate foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan both carried out nuclear tests in May 1998. A
report in the industry newsletter, Nuclear Fuel, says that
plutonium was later found in samples collected by U.S. intelligence
agents from near the Pakistani site in the Chagai hills. They
initially thought that Pakistan had detonated a plutonium weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, analysis of the ratio of plutonium isotopes in the
samples by the U.S. Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico
has shown that it leaked from one of the Indian explosions in the
Pokaran desert, and was blown over to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds plausible,'' says Trevor Findlay from Vertic, a
nuclear test verification center in London. ``It is more likely
that the plutonium is from an Indian test than a Pakistani one.''

<P>
   Ever wondered why listening to loud music or singing at the top
of your voice is such fun? Scientists at the University of
Manchester say a pleasure-inducing hearing mechanism we've
inherited from our fishy ancestors could be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by psychologist Neil Todd, an expert in music
perception, has discovered that the sacculus, an organ forming part
of the balance-regulating vestibular system in our inner ear, is
tuned in to respond to sound frequencies that predominate in music
_ despite the fact that the sacculus is not thought to have any
hearing function.
</P>
<P>
   Even more curious, Todd says, our saccular frequency sensitivity
appears to mimic that of fish _ the only type of creature known to
use its sacculus for hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This primitive hearing mechanism from our vertebrate ancestors
appears to have been conserved as a vestigial sense in humans,''
Todd says.
</P>
<P>
   Because the vestibular system has a connection to the
hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for drives like
hunger, sex and hedonistic responses, Todd believes that people
might be getting a pleasurable buzz when they listen to music _
which could explain why music has developed into such a cultural
force. This buzz may mimic the thrills people get from swings and
bungee jumping, where motion stimulates the balance centre.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a proviso. The sacculus only appears to be
sensitive to loud volumes _ above 90 decibels. Despite this,
crooners could also love their own singing because sound levels in
the larynx have been estimated to be as high as 130 decibels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bloody loud in there,'' Todd says.
</P>
<P>
   Because the sacculus is buried deep within the ear, Todd and his
colleagues Frederick Cody and Jon Banks could not measure its

<P>
   Ever wondered why listening to loud music or singing at the top
of your voice is such fun? Scientists at the University of
Manchester say a pleasure-inducing hearing mechanism we've
inherited from our fishy ancestors could be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by psychologist Neil Todd, an expert in music
perception, has discovered that the sacculus, an organ forming part
of the balance-regulating vestibular system in our inner ear, is
tuned in to respond to sound frequencies that predominate in music
_ despite the fact that the sacculus is not thought to have any
hearing function.
</P>
<P>
   Even more curious, Todd says, our saccular frequency sensitivity
appears to mimic that of fish _ the only type of creature known to
use its sacculus for hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This primitive hearing mechanism from our vertebrate ancestors
appears to have been conserved as a vestigial sense in humans,''
Todd says.
</P>
<P>
   Because the vestibular system has a connection to the
hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for drives like
hunger, sex and hedonistic responses, Todd believes that people
might be getting a pleasurable buzz when they listen to music _
which could explain why music has developed into such a cultural
force. This buzz may mimic the thrills people get from swings and
bungee jumping, where motion stimulates the balance centre.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a proviso. The sacculus only appears to be
sensitive to loud volumes _ above 90 decibels. Despite this,
crooners could also love their own singing because sound levels in
the larynx have been estimated to be as high as 130 decibels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bloody loud in there,'' Todd says.
</P>
<P>
   Because the sacculus is buried deep within the ear, Todd and his
colleagues Frederick Cody and Jon Banks could not measure its
reaction to sound directly. But in regulating balance _
particularly head posture _ the sacculus evokes electrical signals
in certain neck muscles. So the team exploited this by asking
students to tense their neck muscles, and using surface electrodes,
they measured the extra signals produced when the sacculus responds
to sound rather than balance.
</P>
<P>
   In tests, 11 students listened to tone pips of varying
frequencies. Their saccular sensitivity ranged from 50 hertz up to
1000 hertz, with a peak between 300 and 350 hertz. On the musical
scale, middle C is 261 hertz. Male and female voices have frequency
ranges up to 200 and 400 hertz. The researchers will publish their

PLANKTON ESCAPE RAVAGES OF OZONE DEPLETION

   The ozone hole above Antarctica may not be damaging life in the
ocean below after all. If Californian researchers are right, then
increased ultraviolet radiation is having scarcely any effect on
the growth of marine plankton, the base of the ocean's food chain.
</P>
<P>
   The team, led by Kevin Arrigo of Stanford University in Palo
Alto, Calif. has created computer models of phytoplankton growth
over a year in the southern hemisphere before and after the ozone
hole appeared in the 1980s. They included such factors as the
position of the ozone hole, cloud cover, and UV-B strength _ the
type of ultraviolet radiation that increases as atmospheric ozone
declines.
</P>
<P>
   To find out what increased UV-B did to phytoplankton, the
researchers compared two models. One was based on data from 1992, a
year with a yawning ozone hole and the other with the same
parameters except for the ozone levels, which were taken from 1978,
a year of ``normal'' conditions before the hole appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Over the southern hemisphere ecosystem as a whole, they found
that primary phytoplankton production decreased by only about 1
percent in 1992, which is significantly lower than other estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Arrigo's work does not discount the results of a number of
studies showing that increased UV-B can stunt phytoplankton growth
by 10 percent or more in localized areas or in the laboratory. The
difference is that his study looked at the big picture of UV-B for
the whole ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In previous studies, researchers scaled up measurements of
plankton growth beneath the hole and elsewhere to calculate an
overall effect for the whole Southern Ocean. But although they knew
that factors such as cloud cover were important, they are difficult
to include in such calculations.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a cloudy day under a deep hole, there's still not nearly as
much UV flux as on a clear day with no hole,'' Arrigo says.
</P>
<P>
   Another important factor is that, at any given time, around 80
percent of the southern hemisphere's ozone hole is over ice. So
only a small fraction of phytoplankton in Southern Ocean waters
feels the full brunt of ozone depletion, he says. Both these
factors were incorporated into the new models.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Smith, at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
who did landmark research on the effect of increased UV-B on
phytoplankton, says that marine plankton have adapted to cope with
the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that the impact isn't going to be catastrophic,''
he says. ``We've had the ozone hole for a decade and a half and the
system is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Arrigo's results are good news, he says we shouldn't
stop worrying about ozone depletion, because phytoplankton is only
one component of the ecosystem. ``There may be species shifts going
on that no one is aware of,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And we shouldn't forget that Southern Ocean phytoplankton could
be stretched to their limit in absorbing ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they're keeping up,'' he says, ``but if the problem
gets worse who knows?''

DIANE KEATON'S MOVIE COMES CLOSE TO INSULTING ITS TARGET AUDIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the past couple of weeks, female writers have published
pieces in The New York Times Magazine and the Web 'zine Slate
bemoaning the state of ``women's'' entertainment. Neither seems too
happy with Oprah Winfrey's new Oxygen cable network, and Francine
Prose, in her Times piece, inveighs against the TV show
``Providence'' and the Meg Ryan et. al. movie ``Hanging Up.'' To
paraphrase Prose, the movie is condescending to and contemptuous of
its target audience.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably a little more well-meaning than that, but that
doesn't make it a better movie. ``Hanging Up'' was written and
directed by women, and stars three women, who are prominently
displayed on the movie poster in character-development shorthand:
Diane Keaton, in power suit and glasses, is the workaholic
overachiever; Lisa Kudrow, staring off into oblivion, is the
sorta-spacey one; and Ryan, bemused smile in place, is stuck in the
middle of a tangled life.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan is Eve Marks, a party planner whose father (Walter Matthau)
is dying and is suffering the lapses in lucidity that often follow
strokes. Sometimes he's charming and poignant, sometimes he's
amusingly irascible, and sometimes he's just plain cruel, although
he doesn't mean to be. He's a handful, and Eve, who is the only one
who sees him in the hospital, can't get her sisters to visit, much
less help out. She and her siblings communicate so much by
cellphone _ hence the title _ that it's amazing some cell provider
didn't offer to sponsor the movie.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for Ryan, whose likability makes us root for her
characters almost instinctively, we'd realize a lot faster that
someone needs to shake Eve and tell her to get a grip.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a phone rings, she freaks out and cries ``He's
dead!'' as if her father's illness were the only reason anyone
would call in her cell-happy life. She runs her own business, but
she's such a mess it's amazing that she can even find time to
shower, much less to keep her amazing house immaculate and her hair
so perkily disheveled. She has a husband (Adam Arkin) whose
moral-support method is to sternly make decisions for her; when he
leaves town, Eve nearly dissolves into a pile of Jell-O. She also
has an elementary-school-age son who shows up to do something cute,
then virtually disappears from the movie. Eve barely has a
conversation with the poor kid; maybe he's the one who's keeping
the house clean, just to get her attention.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan acts her heart out trying to make us like Eve, but she's
straining against the increasing cloyingness of screenwriters Nora
and Delia Ephron, whose own sibling rivalries had to be more
realistic than what we see here. Everyone in Eve's family has _ or
had _ a glamour job: older sister Georgia (Keaton) is a Grace
Mirabella-esque magazine publisher, younger sister Maddie (Kudrow)
is a self-absorbed and flaky soap-opera actress, and dad was part
of a screenwriting team _ and the Ephrons appear to believe that
dying parents affect only this class level. They also throw in a
divorce, represented in the form of a mom (Cloris Leachman, seen
far too briefly) who walked out on their dad and his shenanigans
long before he was sick.
</P>
<P>
   Not a trick is missed in the manipulation department _ ``Hanging
Up'' should have been called ``Pushing Buttons.'' But it's strange
to think that, with so much feminine talent involved, the
filmmakers couldn't see that they're delivering an anti-feminist
product and forcing their points about female solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   This is a real letdown from Keaton, who directs with the
nervousness and frenetic tics that are a hallmark of her acting
style; in performance, it can be beguiling, but as presentation,
it's maddening. It's as if she's always interrupting herself
because she can't decide what insight she wants to present next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanging Up'' is easier to take than two other current movies
directed by women, Jane Campion's bizarrely entertaining screed
``Holy Smoke!'' and Kimberly Peirce's dark and brutal ``Boys Don't
Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's only because it has less to say, and what it has to
say has been said before. You can give it points for not being
totally offensive, along the lines of the Fox show ``Who Wants to
Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' But at least ``Millionaire'' was
honest about its offensiveness; ``Hanging Up'' dresses its
offensiveness up in glamorous black and winsomeness and even fools
itself. Look closely, though, and you'll see that the empresses are
wearing no clothes.

`MISS JULIE' A MIX OF STAGE AND SCREEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Miss Julie'' is an intriguing cross between the
disciplines of theater and film. Directed by Mike Figgis (``Leaving
Las Vegas''), it has some of the most cutting dialogue since 1966's
``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''
</P>
<P>
   Although infrequently staged in the United States, ``Miss
Julie'' is a classic play often studied in drama classes and
performed in Europe. Written in 1888 by August Strindberg, it is a
one-act work, a three-person drama that dissects issues of class
and gender through a highly personal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of what Figgis calls ``political propaganda'' relevant to
the time and original location _ Sweden _ has been dropped. That
leavesa battle of wills, emotions and sexuality between the two
main characters.
</P>
<P>
   The title character is the immature and rebellious daughter of a
wealthy count. Jean is the count's calculating, cynical footman.
The third character, less seen, is Christine, the count's cook and
Jean's secret lover and fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Miss Julie'' is being released by United Artists, a
major Hollywood studio, it is a low-budget picture aimed at viewers
who enjoy live theater, where conversation dominates scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Julie is played by talented English actress Saffron
Burrows, who appeared in ``Circle of Friends'' and ``In the Name of
the Father.'' She's also the scientist about to be chomped on the
poster for ``Deep Blue Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean is Scottish actor Peter Mullan (``Braveheart,''
``Trainspotting'') who gave a fantastic performance in 1998's
little-seen Scottish drama ``My Name Is Joe,'' for which he won a
best-actor award at the Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The story takes place one evening after a party, in and around
the castle's huge kitchen. Miss Julie has taken a fancy to Jean and
brazenly comes into servant territory looking for him.
</P>
<P>
   The result is about 100 minutes of emotional dynamite as each
character tries to get the upper hand, either through seduction or
belittlement. Sometimes it's hard to tell which is which.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their language to each other, at its core, is really
shocking,'' Figgis said.
</P>
<P>
   Figgis, who was nominated for Academy Awards as both director
and writer of ``Leaving Las Vegas,'' also wrote the adaptation of
the play for this film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the contradictions in the male-female characters
were really interesting _ the way (one) turned left when the other
turned right,'' Figgis said.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a roller coaster in which, at first, one character
is on top and the other at the bottom. Then the sides are reversed.
Words and class are used as deadly blades to cut deep.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship spirals increasingly out of control. Jean, who
is smart, angry and opportunistic _ not to mention snobbishly
class-conscious _ alternately rejects, manipulates, mocks and
encourages Miss Julie. An easy judgment would be that Jean is
cruel. But Mullan finds that far too simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a million ways to play this character,'' Mullan
said, his Glasgow accent so thick it demands close attention,
especially since he speaks quickly. ``Cruel is the least
interesting side to me. Sad? Bitter? Lonely? Arrogant? Stupid? I
would apply those terms. I don't know if he's cruel. He's too sad
for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a mask he puts on whenever he thinks he's vulnerable.
He knows if he really opens up his soul, it leaves one option only,
and that's rebellion. Rebel against the class system ...rebel
against his own feelings of inferiority ... and he's not up to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he looks at Miss Julie, she is so beautiful, so
privileged, so articulate, so above him that he feels like
Quasimodo. He feels ugly in her presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when he sees a little avenue _ `Ah, for some bizarre
reason you find me attractive' _ he uses that.''
</P>
<P>
   To maintain the theatricality of the piece, Figgis applied an
unusual cinematic approach to filming. Most of the movie was shot
in long takes, with two cameras _ one operated by Figgis _ to
achieve a playlike feel and ensure the best material in the least
time. The film was shot in 16 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire set is in soft light so there is no shadow,''
Figgis said of his approach, which allowed the actors to roam with
relative freedom, not trying to hit prearranged marks to be in the
right light. ``The actors can go anywhere they want.''
</P>
<P>
   But the style also created some unexpected humor for the actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have two (sound) booms going whoosh and two boom
operators who haven't a clue where the other one is going _ whoosh,
whoom, swoosh _ and you see cameramen crashing into a wall and
pretending absolutely nothing has happened, and you are doing this
serious love scene or being all angst-ridden, it's riotously
funny,'' Mullan said.
</P>
<P>
   The technique paid off in unexpected ways. For instance, there
is an intense love scene in the middle of the movie. Figgis shows
it in split screen, from two cameras at once. It's an unusual and
somehow shockingly personal approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the scene to be really erotic, but I didn't want any
nudity; I didn't want it to be explicit,'' Figgis said. ``But I did
want it to be something very intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Both actors and director insist the technique came about by
accident. To save time and money, Figgis would play back scenes
from both cameras at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day they were looking at the love-making in this fashion
and they thought it was very powerful,'' Burrows said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised when I saw it. It's hard to imagine until
you see it what it will do to the eye. I find it very erotic. It
seems it's more than two images. It seems to multiply into more
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Figgis was delighted with the unexpected result.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw it on play-back, I was completely blown away. Maybe
it's that, in a sex scene, we are always put in the perverse
position of the uninvited voyeur. Maybe if you put two cameras in
there, it allows us to escape the awkwardness of watching something
we really shouldn't be watching.''

 &HT;    In best tradition of `Wall Street' greed, fast-talking stock
hustlers in the `Boiler Room' indulge their inner shark
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A study of young, muscle-mouthed stockbrokers aiming to make
their first million before getting their first wrinkle, ``Boiler
Room'' pays on-screen tribute to the two movies it most resembles:
``Wall Street'' and ``Glengarry Glen Ross.'' It translates the
cutthroat energy of those flicks into a bracing, boom-year reminder
that greed is still good _ so long as you don't get caught when you
pretzel the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Seth (Giovanni Ribisi) is a 19-year-old dropout, running an
illegal casino out of his Queens apartment. That doesn't exactly
thrill his judgmental father (Ron Rifkin), who actually is a judge.
So when one of Seth's gambling customers, Greg (Nicky Katt),
invites him to try his hand as a stockbroker, Seth sees it as a way
to get ahead and earn Dad's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The career move doesn't take him to Wall Street, but to an
innocuous office building on Long Island, home of the brokerage
firm J.T. Marlin. The name intentionally sounds a lot like Wall
Street's J.P. Morgan. If would-be investors accidentally think
they're dealing with that recognized firm ... well, it's not the
broker's fault, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Marlin is really a chop shop, where the guys cold-call would-be
customers and bully them with guy talk and reverse psychology until
they invest in the day's latest speculative stock. The goal: to get
rich as soon (and as easily) as possible. ``Nobody wants to work
for it any more,'' Seth says. The firm's center of operations is
called the boiler room, an apt name given the heat and sweat
generated by these guys (including Vin Diesel, Jamie Kennedy and
Scott Caan) as they work the phones.
</P>
<P>
   One of them explains it to Seth, saying, ``You can be whoever
you want to be on the phone.'' It's an excuse for the mild Seth to
turn into an alpha male. It also gives Ribisi a dynamic acting
range. He runs with it, letting us watch Seth discover his inner
shark as he masters the art of the sell: part performance art, part
relentless seduction.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Ben Younger experienced the sales pitch of a
boiler room recruiter in real life. His fascination with the
thrill-junkie life of these stock jocks is reflected in the
script's sharp, arrogant dialogue (including a rude phrase that
sums up the guys' rule of never doing business with women).
</P>
<P>
   The lively talk extends beyond the brokerage walls. When Seth
tells his father that he wants to talk about their
``relationship,'' Dad zings his choice of word: ``What, are we
dating?'' Speaking of Dad, the movie (just like ``Wall Street'')
gets hamstrung with a last-act focus on father-son conflict. Sure,
it's effective. It's also hokey.
</P>
<P>
   Some other minuses: Younger manufactures a cardboard romance
between Seth and the firm's secretary, a role that's only the
latest to reduce the talented Nia Long to sexy set decor. Other
characters (including the shadowy head of J.T. Marlin, Tom Everett
Scott) don't seem well-defined; it feels as though scenes have been
cut for length. Oh, and another thing: The movie shows that Younger
is making his debut as a director. While his script is taut, his
visuals are sometimes cruddy.
</P>
<P>
   The flaws are balanced by the film's bad-boy energy and the
actors' clear delight in their characters' tirades and
testosterone. The cast includes Ben Affleck as Marlin's senior
recruiter. Given to rat-a-tat proclamations about the rules of the
game, he's basically doing a riff on the tough-talking role played
by Alec Baldwin in ``Glengarry.'' In only a few minutes on-screen,
Affleck shows more vigor than in all two hours of his upcoming
action flick, ``Reindeer Games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and Ron Rifkin. Rated R for
strong language and some drug content. 1 hour, 59 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A high-powered descendant of ``Wall Street'' and
``Glengarry Glen Ross.''

 &HT;    Very little sparkles in Douglas' `Diamonds'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Diamonds'' could be described as a requiem for a heavyweight.
Not this film's aging boxer, but the actor who plays him, Kirk
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, alas, is a total lightweight, a well-intentioned but
clumsy vehicle for the remarkably game and courageous Douglas, who
has struggled back from a debilitating stroke he suffered a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a gee-who-thought-of-that? bit of typecasting, Douglas plays
Harry Agensky, a tough former welterweight champion who has
suffered a stroke. When we first meet Harry, he's dutifully going
through some demeaning but necessary speech-therapy exercises,
dispensed on video by a dismayingly cheerful young woman. Harry is
a survivor, but he's all too aware that he was a better boxer than
parent. Now that his beloved wife is dead, he's afraid he'll end up
in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the setup for a bonding trip with his estranged son, Lance
(Dan Aykroyd), and Lance's all-but-estranged son, Michael (Corbin
Allred). The old man insists that he knows the whereabouts of a
stash of diamonds he earned by taking a dive 60 years ago. So,
goodbye, Vancouver; hello, Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The multigenerational banter is excruciating; it makes lines
like ``suck face'' from the slightly similar ``On Golden Pond''
sound like Shakespeare. Further, when Douglas is off-screen, the
movie shrivels into dust. Aykroyd, so surprisingly touching as
another out-of-touch son in ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' is stiff, while
Allred spouts his dialogue as if he would really like a regular
spot on a hit TV series. The final blow to whatever dignity the
picture might have mustered is a coyly embarrassing trip to a
brothel where the madame (Lauren Bacall, providing another
much-needed beacon of professionalism) has a heart of gold, the
girls are all loving and compliant and the place itself looks like
a Victorian gingerbread house.
</P>
<P>
   Bacall provided similar distaff ballast in John Wayne's lovely
last film, ``The Shootist.'' Her role is small but invaluable, a
reminder of why legends become legends. But the movie's well-earned
raison d'etre is Douglas. The hair is gray, the shoulders slightly
hunched, the speech slurred. But Douglas is still Douglas.
Spartacus and the corrupt reporter in ``Ace in the Hole.'' Doc
Holliday and the doomed cowboy in ``Lonely Are the Brave.'' Van
Gogh and the honorable officer in ``Paths of Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the movie's treats is director John Asher's use of clips
from Douglas' breakthrough film, ``Champion,'' as ``flashbacks'' to
Harry's fighting career. (One drawback: That movie's vitality only
underscores this one's listlessness.)
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Douglas is a diamond in a rough script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamonds''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirk Douglas, Dan Aykroyd and Lauren Bacall. Directed
by John Asher. Rated PG-13 for profanity and sexual content. 1
hour, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The good news is that Kirk Douglas is back; the bad
news is that he's back in this.

 &HT;    Bright, breezy `Hanging Up' ultimately gets its wires crossed
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the impression fostered by the ads, ``Hanging Up'' looks
as if it comes from the same girl-movie ghetto as ``The First Wives
Club'' and ``Soul Food.'' It seems to be a sidesplitting comedy
about three sisters (Diane Keaton, Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow) trying
to get along by reaching out and touching one another over the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and if you really pay attention, you may notice their
irascible father (Walter Matthau), whose mortality is becoming
something of a strain, in the background.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, ``Hanging Up'' has a lot more in common with such
selfish-aging-parent-and-con-
</P>
<P>
   fused-adult-child movies as, well, ``Nothing in Common'' (Jackie
Gleason and Tom Hanks) or ``Memories of Me'' (Alan King and Billy
Crystal).
</P>
<P>
   The real focus here is on the increasingly dependent, certainly
dying father _ a once-successful screenwriter long ago divorced by
his wife _ and his love-hate relationship with his middle daughter,
Eve (Ryan).
</P>
<P>
   All three of his daughters are major achievers, 21st-century
style. But, tellingly, only Eve has managed to combine a career
(event planner) with a family. Georgia (Keaton), the eldest, is
some unholy cross between Gloria Steinem, Diane Sawyer and Barbara
Walters. She's too busy planning the fifth anniversary of her
magazine _ the aptly named Georgia _ to bother with doctors and
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Maddy (Lisa Kudrow), the youngest, is an adorable ditz with a
recurring role in a soap opera. Her most enduring emotional
involvement is with her oversized Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Eve, who, we soon see, was always Daddy's favorite
but never could come to terms with his selfishness and aggression.
The dual demands of his dementia and his inevitable death are, for
her, overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere beneath the insistently breezy script of the Ephron
sisters (Nora and Delia, who based the story on Delia's novelistic
memoir of their father's death) and Keaton's brisk direction,
there's a far more painful and genuine story. You can see it in
Ryan's raw emotional breakdowns, in the naked fear in Matthau's
eyes, in Keaton's deft sendup of what happens when the culture's
long-designated caregivers _ the daughters _ opt for a career over
bedpans and hand-holding.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this is a serious, worthy theme, in many ways as
old as ``King Lear.'' It's the sort of picture that can _ and does
_ handle some humor but, at heart, dares to ask some difficult
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the result is a decent, often entertaining yet
ultimately disappointing film. ``Hanging Up'' backs off when it
should've hung in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanging Up''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Diane Keaton, Meg Ryan, Lisa Kudrow and Walter Matthau.
Directed by Keaton. Rated PG-13 for profanity and mid sexual
themes. 1 hour, 32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Phone-ey at its core,
</P>
<P>
   but nicely acted.

 &HT;    Allen's `Lowdown' hits middling note
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You remember Emmet Ray, don't you?
</P>
<P>
   Of course you don't. Emmet Ray is a fictional character, a
legendary jazz guitarist from the 1930s, invented by Woody Allen
for his new mockumentary, ``Sweet and Lowdown.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Allen, who appears with a number of other
talking-head experts as part of the film's conceit, Ray (Oscar
nominee Sean Penn) was an eccentric genius who liked to shoot rats
in garbage dumps and watch trains for hours. He was also a great
guitarist, second only to genuine Gypsy legend Django Reinhardt, in
whose presence Ray has fainted. Twice.
</P>
<P>
   What we essentially learn about Ray is that, outside his music,
he was a selfish, womanizing, alcoholic, egotistical louse. But
with a guitar in his hands, he was transformed into a muse, an
artist, an angel of jazz. He sleeps with women, but his true love
is music. Notes one character before taking up with him, ``He can
only feel pain through his music. Such is the ego of genius. I must
get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman who almost changes his life is as sweet as he is
lowdown. She's Hattie (supporting actress Oscar nominee Samantha
Morton), a waiflike mute who suggests the girlish heroines of the
'20s _ the Gish sisters or Mae Marsh. Or, more eerily, Mia Farrow
in some of Allen's own films. But Hattie and Emmet's romance is
derailed. By his ambition, his unreliability, his abusiveness and,
most specifically, by a swank-looking debutante (Uma Thurman) with
pretensions of being a writer. She's not kidding when she says with
unadorned awe, ``Not only are you vain and egotistical, you have
genuine crudeness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet and Lowdown'' is slight and, as a faux documentary, it
can't begin to compare with Allen's imortal ``Zelig.'' But Penn,
who thankfully chooses not to do a Woody impersonation a la John
Cusack in ``Bullets Over Broadway'' and Kenneth Branagh in
``Celebrity,'' is superb. He smartly suggests that there must be
something inside this swine that allows him to create such
beautiful music, but he leaves it a mystery. Mostly, he's pure,
swaggering pork.
</P>
<P>
   Morton is touchingly delicate in a pretty ridiculous role, and
Thurman, for once, seems confident in her work, not her looks.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's still a whiff of Woody
self-justification. It's as if he finally got to write his essay
about the artist vs. the man and the whole Mia/Soon-Yi debacle. His
wife, Soon-Yi Previn, may not be mute, but ``Wild Man Blues''
showed that she is hardly a marvelous conversationalist. And when
Ray rails ``I made a mistake'' near the movie's end, you can't tell
whether it's an apology or a shut-up-already.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet and Lowdown'' is middling Woody. It looks good, thanks
to Zhao Fei, who used to work with Zhang Yimou (``Raise the Red
Lantern''). And it sounds good, thanks to guitarist Howard Alden,
who makes Penn's music. If a ranking is helpful, it's far better
than such recent work as ``Celebrity,'' ``Everybody Says I Love
You'' and ``Deconstructing Harry.'' But compared with Allen's work
in the late 1970s, '80s and early '90s, it's just a jazzy little
doodle of a picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet and Lowdown''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn, Samantha Morton and Uma Thurman. Directed by
Woody Allen. Rated PG-13 for profanity, sexual situations and
alcohol abuse. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Slight but likable if you can get past the
self-justification.

<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother'' R (profanity, sexuality, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cecilia Roth,
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Paredes
</P>
<P>
   and Penelope Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: foreign film. Spain's bad-boy filmmaker
Pedro Almodovar grows up with this humane celebration of nurturing
women. It's a virtually male-free fable with a title inspired by
that backstage classic ``All About Eve.'' ``Mother'' can wink at
its own campy sensibility while still grabbing you by the gut. Dark
and tender, the movie beautifully balances humor and heartache. In
Spanish with subtitles. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   8 Oscar nominations: picture, actor (Kevin Spacey), actress
(Annette Bening), director, original screenplay, cinematography,
film editing, original score. The ever-more-remarkable Spacey plays
a man caught in a midlife limbo in this scarily disturbing,
daringly hilarious, well-written and well-acted comedy-drama. It's
a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the Beautifully Screwed
Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``American Movie'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   featuring Mark Borchardt.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Smith's documentary is alternately hilarious and
horrifying as it chronicles Mark Borchardt's attempts to make his
autobiographical magnum opus, ``Northwestern.'' The 30-ish
Borchardt _ a high-school drop-out with three kids who still lives
with his mother _ is a not-so-young, incredibly selfish film geek.
``American Movie'' is funny, scary and as compulsively watchable as
a train wreck. (ERG) 1 hour, 44 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' R (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson
</P>
<P>
   and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: original score. A finely made adaptation of
Frank McCourt's popular memoir of growing up in poverty and death
in Ireland. Fans of the book will enjoy seeing their favorite parts
re-created onscreen. Others, who don't have the memory of McCourt's
lyrical prose whispering in their heads, might wonder what the fuss
is all about. (SM) 2 hours, 26 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jodie Foster
</P>
<P>
   and Chow Yun-Fat.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: art direction, costumes. Maybe we didn't
need another version, but this one is handsome and engaging. Jodie
Foster and Chow Yun-Fat star in this lavish, songless costume drama
that holds its own against the beloved 1956 musical ``The King and
I.'' (SM)2 hours, 20 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino,
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone takes on pro football's dark side _ pills, booze,
prostitutes, shady back-office deals _ and almost fumbles. The
jarring game visuals come at you nonstop. Al Pacino plays the coach
of the fictional Miami Sharks and argues constantly with young team
co-owner Cameron Diaz. Jamie Foxx plays a rising quarterback and
emerges as the best actor in the large cast. (Bob Longino) 2 hours,
50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beach'' R (violence, profanity, sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Leonardo DiCaprio
</P>
<P>
   and Virginie Ledoyen
</P>
<P>
   A secondhand plot. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a restless young man
who travels with other aimless, privileged young people to a hidden
paradise _ then screws it up. It's hard to get attached to
characters who care about only one thing: their next moment of
pleasure. The cinematography makes the most of exotic locations.
But all the beauty in the world can't camouflage the film's
gorgeous emptiness. (SM)1 hour, 59 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: director, supporting actress (Catherine
Keener), original screenplay. It's a loopy original. John Cusack
plays a quirky file clerk who discovers a door that leads into the
noggin of actor John Malkovich. Toying with big concepts _ the
nature of identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire, the
illusion of free will, it's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Giovanni Ribisi,
</P>
<P>
   Vin Diesel and Ron Rifkin.
</P>
<P>
   A high-powered descendant of ``Wall Street'' and ``Glengarry
Glen Ross,'' this study of muscle-mouthed stockbrokers aiming to
make their first million before getting their first wrinkle pays
onscreen tribute to those two movies. It's a bracing reminder that
greed is still good _ so long as you don't get caught when you
pretzel the rules. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' R (profanity, violence and grisly images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Double Jeopardy,'' this crime drama is, at its core, pure
pulp filmmaking. It delivers plenty of sucker punches. But thanks
to the film's two talented stars _ Denzel Washington as a brainy
quadriplegic detective and Angelina Jolie as his equally brainy
forensics cop _ this thriller's got enough electricity to make it
watchable. (Bob Longino)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   7 Oscar nominations: picture, director, adapted screenplay,
supporting actor (Michael Caine), art direction, original score,
film editing. John Irving adapted his own novel. In the first half,
Dr. Larch (Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal abortions in
his Maine orphanage. In the second, less-engaging half, Larch's
protege, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), runs off to learn about the
world. (ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamonds'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirk Douglas,
</P>
<P>
   Dan Aykroyd and Lauren Bacall.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, Kirk Douglas is back on screen after a serious
stroke. The bad news is, he's back in this. He plays an aging boxer
who convinces his estranged son (Dan Aykroyd) and loving grandson
to drive to Reno where he stashed some diamonds 60 years ago. The
bonding road-trip is excruciating and a visit to a brothel (run by
a very professional Lauren Bacall) is almost unwatchable. (ERG)1
hour, 37 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' R (scenes of strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore
</P>
<P>
   and Stephen Rea.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: actress (Julianne Moore), cinematography.
Neil Jordan's somber, velvety and often sensual adaptation of
Graham Greene's novel explores love both physical and spiritual.
While the movie doesn't skimp on humid clinches and bared skin, it
also summons up the intangible mysteries of sacrifice and devotion
to a higher power. (SM)1 hour, 49 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Eye of the Beholder'' R (language, sex, nudity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ewan McGregor
</P>
<P>
   and Ashley Judd.
</P>
<P>
   Boredom, like beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What begins
as a hypnotic riff on the old surveillance classic, ``The
Conversation,'' ultimately veers off into nowhere. Too bad because
the picture is as stylishly acted as it is directed. An isolated
British surveillance agent (Ewan McGregor) becomes more involved
than he intends in the case of a diplomat's son and a mysterious
femme fatale (Ashley Judd). (ERG)1 hour, 50 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia/2000'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated. Music from Beethoven
</P>
<P>
   and Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The entirety of this new ``Fantasia'' isn't worth one whirling
mushroom from the 1940 original. The movie lacks the wit, charm,
warmth, humor and awe of its predecessor, underscored by the
inclusion of one old segment, ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' Our
advice: Drop off the kids, shop the mall, then go rent the
original. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' PG (mild violence and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver
</P>
<P>
   and Alan Rickman.
</P>
<P>
   It'll beam you up, up and away. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and
Alan Rickman lead a small band of has-been sci-fi TV show actors
lured by misguided aliens into helping them save their far, far
away galaxy from an invasion of evil bug-lizards. Though it starts
slowly, ``Quest's'' completely cornball humor sometimes scores
direct hits. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' R (profanity and drug content,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality and suicide)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Winona Ryder
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: supporting actress (Angelina Jolie). Two
fine actresses, two fine performances. Based on Susanna Kaysen's
memoir about the two years she spent in the '60s at a mental
hospital, the movie goes for a rip-roaring tone reminiscent of
``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' Winona Ryder steadies the
movie, but Jolie provides the fireworks as a charismatic sociopath.
(ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   4 Oscar nominations: picture, supporting actor (Michael Clarke
Duncan), adapted screenplay, sound. A manipulative but meticulously
crafted, absorbing and beautifully acted adaptation of Stephen
King's prison novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose
latest prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Duncan, has mystical
powers of healing. (SM) 3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun Shy'' R (profanity, violence and brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Bullock and Oliver Platt.
</P>
<P>
   Stressed-out undercover drug cop Liam Neeson matches ulcers with
stressed-out junior Mafioso Oliver Platt in a deeply funky New York
comedy about murder, stomach disorders and male anxiety. It's
scattershot, but it scores a few surprising satirical bull's-eyes.
Love interest Sandra Bullock's screen time is unwisely minimized by
producer Sandra Bullock. (Bob Campbell, Newhouse News Service)1
hour, 42 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanging Up'' PG (profanity and mild sexual themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Diane Keaton,
</P>
<P>
   Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   Breezily written by the Ephron sisters and briskly directed by
Diane Keaton, the movie's ads want you to believe it's a
side-splitting sibling comedy about three sisters (Keaton, Meg
Ryan, Lisa Kudrow) trying to connect. However, it's really an aging
parent-confused adult child story in which Ryan tries to be all
things to her dying dad (Walter Matthau). (ERG) 1 hour, 32 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Smoke'' R (sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kate Winslet
</P>
<P>
   and Harvey Keitel.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Campion's movie is about how we blow smoke at each other
emotionally, spiritually and sexually. An Australian girl (Kate
Winslet) who's joined a cult in India is lured home by her family,
who hire a professional deprogrammer (Harvey Keitel). As the two
face off, the question becomes who will deprogram who. It's a
brutally primal battle of the sexes that makes Sam Shepard look
tame. (ERG)1 hour, 44 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' R (profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Vicellous Reon Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: actor (Denzel Washington). Washington
delivers his best performance in years as pugilist Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter, the middleweight contender wrongly imprisoned
for nearly 20 years in a triple murder. Though ably directed, the
film contains some fabrications to tell this otherwise compelling
true story. (Bob Longino)
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' R (profanity, drug use, sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julianne Moore
</P>
<P>
   and Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: supporting actor (Tom Cruise), original
screenplay, song. A mesmerizing tapestry about broken families,
love and forgiveness. Unfolding at fever pitch and studded with
small miracles of acting, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's
movie is exhilarating and exhausting, the sort of thing you live
through as much as watch. The payoff is well worth it. (SM)2 hours,
59 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries of Egypt'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Omar Sharif
</P>
<P>
   and Kate Maberly.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic's bigger-than-life Imax film offers many
breathtaking views of Egypt's natural and man-made wonders. There
is ample footage of giant pyramids, huge statues and redwood-tall
columns, all frequently displayed from ground view with a seemingly
you-are-there feel. Warning: Some of the narration is pure hokum.
(Bob Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Friday'' R (profanity, drug use, sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ice Cube
</P>
<P>
   and Mike Epps.
</P>
<P>
   A dumb comedy. The best that can be said for this sequel to
``Friday'' is that, unlike the first flick, the characters don't
spend most of the movie sitting on the front steps yacking and
getting stoned. They go elsewhere to get stoned. Lamely written,
it's a reminder that, while complex, mature and funny
African-American comedies are being made, there's always a market
for flatulence and dog poop jokes. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black'' R (profanity and sci-fi violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vin Diesel
</P>
<P>
   and Radha Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry aliens, stupid humans: the usual. ``Pitch Black'' is just
the latest sci-fi ripoff of ``Aliens,'' packed with caricatures. In
the movie's last hour, writer-director David Towhy pretends to
explore his stick figures' moral choices, and he forgets to deliver
the thrills. (SM) 1 hour, 47 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Play It to the Bone'' R (violence, sexuality, drug content,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Antonio Banderas,
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson and Lolita Davidovich.
</P>
<P>
   An entertaining take on boxing. Antonio Banderas' Cesar, a
Madrid-born boxer, now lives in Los Angeles and has become best
pals with Woody Harrelson's Vince, a Texas-born fighter. The first
half of the film is a road movie, with Grace (Lolita Davidovich),
Vince's former girlfriend and Cesar's current lady, driving them to
Las Vegas; it soon becomes a love story. (Kevin Thomas, From Los
Angeles Times.) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' R (profanity and strong horror violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette and Neve
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a scream any more, but it's a decent wrapup of the
series. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette
are all back and on the Hollywood set of ``Stab 3,'' ducking the
knife-swings of a killer clad in the familiar Halloween getup. The
new movie isn't as clever with its clues as the others, but it
manages to wheeze its way across the finish line, wrapping up the
trilogy in satisfying fashion. (SM)1 hour, 56 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Simpatico'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeff Bridges, Nick Nolte,
</P>
<P>
   Albert Finney and Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the world of horse-racing, this movie reminds you that
you can have the best bloodlines imaginable and sometimes the nag
still won't run. A blue-ribbon cast is wasted on a tale of old pals
with a shared shady past that still haunts them 20 years later.
Jeff Bridges is a wealthy Kentucky breeder; Sharon Stone his
doped-up, depressed wife; Nick Nolte a crumpled alcoholic
blackmailing Bridges. (ERG)1 hour, 40 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis,
</P>
<P>
   Haley Joel Osment
</P>
<P>
   and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   6 Oscar nominations: picture, director, supporting actor (Haley
Joel Osment), supporting actress (Toni Collette), original
screenplay, film editing. A surprising, spine-tingling gem.
Eight-year-old Cole (Osment) can see restless phantoms with their
skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film that speculates on
what the relationship between the restless dead and a liaison to
the living world might be. (SM) 1 hour, 47 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' R (violence and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp,
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: cinematography, art direction, costumes.
Tim Burton's latest is a blend of scary swordplay, witchcraft and
self-spoofing humor. Johnny Depp is effective as Ichabod Crane, who
investigates a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy Hollow. The
movie's comic relief balances the Headless Horseman's single-minded
attacks, which spare neither men, women nor children. (SM) 1 hour,
45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Day'' PG (mild peril and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chevy Chase.
</P>
<P>
   A lame kids movie about Syracuse schoolkids trying to extend one
out-of-school snow day into two. Chevy Chase plays a TV weatherman
suffering all kinds of humiliation and Chris Elliott appears as the
ominous Snow Plow Man with bad teeth. (Robert Denerstein, Denver
Rocky Mountain News)1 hour, 30 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: actor (Richard Farnsworth). David Lynch
shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film based on the true
story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Farnsworth), who drove his John
Deere riding mower more than 300 miles to reconcile with his
brother. It's a sublime celebration of America at its most
beautiful: kind, welcoming, gloriously eccentric. (ERG) 1 hour, 41
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geena Davis,
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lipnicki and
</P>
<P>
   the voice of Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: visual effects. Based loosely on E.B.
White's 1945 children's book, Stuart is a 3-inch-tall
computer-animated wonder voiced by Michael J. Fox. He brushes his
teeth, gargles and aw-shucks smiles with such convincing visuals
you'll swear he's the next best critter since ``Babe.'' But his
movie, at first charming and angelic, turns into slapstick. (Bob
Longino) 1 hour, 33 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet and Lowdown'' R (profanity, sexuality and alcohol abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring
</P>
<P>
   Sean Penn and
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Morton
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: actor (Sean Penn), supporting actress
(Samantha Morton). This jazzy little doodle of a mockumentary is
middling Woody Allen and, as such, mildly likable once you get past
the insistent whiff of self-justification. Penn is superb as a
legendary (and fictional) jazz guitarist in the 1930s who's an
angel with a guitar in his hands and a louse the rest of the time.
(ERG) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented ...'' R (violence, profanity, brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matt Damon,
</P>
<P>
   Jude Law and
</P>
<P>
   Gwyneth Paltrow
</P>
<P>
   5 Oscar nominations: supporting actor (Jude Law), adapted
screenplay, art direction, original score, costumes. A handsome but
flawed adaptation of novelist Patricia Highsmith's twisty thriller.
Matt Damon plays the title character, who travels to Italy to bring
back a rich man's son but ends up adopting his lifestyle and
committing murder. (SM) 2 hours, 18 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tigger Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature with
</P>
<P>
   Tigger, Pooh, Baby Roo, Piglet, etc.
</P>
<P>
   This charming animated feature clearly knows its intended tot
audience and takes care of them. The irrepressible, ever-bouncing
Tigger goes searching for his family and discovers his real family
isn't necessarily other Tiggers. Pooh, Piglet, Baby Roo and the
whole A.A. Milne gang are back, as are the Sherman brothers (``Mary
Poppins''), who wrote the sprightly songs. As Tigger himself would
say, it's tiggerific. (ERG) 1 hour, 16 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy'' R (for a scene of risque nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Broadbent
</P>
<P>
   and Allan Corduner.
</P>
<P>
   4 Oscar nominations: original screenplay, art direction,
costumes, makeup. You don't have to be a fan of Gilbert and
Sullivan's operettas to enjoy it. But a love of the theater can
help you appreciate Mike Leigh's meticulously detailed valentine to
performers of the 19th century. (SM)2 hours, 39 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' G
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation
</P>
<P>
   featuring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and Joan Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: song. More rock 'em, sock 'em fun than
families have seen in years. Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim
Allen) and old and new characters are locked in a delightful story
of toy rustling and what it means to love a child. It sports an
inspired, hilarious script and stunning visuals. (Bob Longino) 1
hour, 25 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whole Nine Yards'' R (sexuality, nudity, and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Perry
</P>
<P>
   and Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   A comedy with a body count and familiar mafioso premise, but
with enough twists to eventually overcome its familiarity. Bruce
Willis stars as a hit man. As in ``The Sixth Sense,'' he doesn't
seem to mind playing genial straight man to his funnier cast mates:
Matthew Perry, Patricia Arquette and Kevin Pollack. (SM)1 hour, 43
minutes. B

 &HT;    `Pitch Black' a dim rip-off
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We're hemorrhaging air,'' shouts docking pilot Fry (Radha
Mitchell) as her hole-riddled spaceship flames through a planet's
atmosphere like a hunk of intergalactic Swiss cheese. Air isn't the
only problem. ``Pitch Black'' starts hemorrhaging its brains and
any originality soon after the star cruiser crash-lands on an alien
desert floor.
</P>
<P>
   At first the nine survivors worry most about Riddick (Vin
Diesel), a murderous convict who has snapped his chains and is
playing cat-and-mouse games in the dunes. Soon, though, these folks
realize that there's something worse out there: sharp-toothed
beasties living in caves beneath the sand. The humans are fine so
long as it's daylight, and, hey, this planet has three suns. But
guess what: Here comes the first eclipse in 22 years, and the
humans are about to become monster hash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aliens,'' anyone? The sense of deja vu isn't helped by
Mitchell's Ripley-like role as a flawed heroine known by her last
name and hellbent on keeping her passengers alive. Plus, there's
the surrogate mother-child bond she develops with a stowaway kid.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, imitation equals flattery, right? The problem is,
``Aliens'' not only covered this territory already, it did so with
enough finesse to make it one of the best popcorn movies of the
past 20 years. ``Pitch Black'' is just the latest rip-off, packed
with caricatures. There's a fussy antiques dealer (Lewis
Fitz-Gerald), a tough geologist (Claudia Black), the edgy lawman
(Cole Hauser) transporting Riddick and a Muslim (Keith David) with
three young pilgrims. These four skirt the line of racist
buffoonery, praising Allah repeatedly, even when they're on the
verge of getting munched.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie's last hour, writer-director David Twohy pretends
to explore his stick figures' moral choices, and he forgets to
deliver the thrills. During the dull patches, you may puzzle over a
few details. For instance, what exactly do these monsters eat
during their 22-year hibernation periods? Sand? It's also annoying
that the number of creatures menacing the cast varies arbitrarily
from scene to scene.
</P>
<P>
   A nuanced actor even in a genre flick like this, Mitchell
(``High Art'') brings a (perhaps misplaced) emotional conviction to
her role. But the movie's real star is the hyper-muscled Diesel.
Jammed into a tank top and kept glistening wet, he's shot like the
sexiest new sport-utility vehicle to come off the assembly line. By
comparison, the computer-generated, winged critters seem puny. They
look like the offspring of a lizard and an anvil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vin Diesel and Radha Mitchell. Rated R for profanity
and sci-fi violence and gore. 1 hour, 47 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Hungry aliens, stupid humans: the usual.

 &HT;    Comedy keeps rolling as `Whole Nine Yards' goes the distance
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this age of mafiosi hiring shrinks on screens big and small,
Jimmy ``the Tulip'' Tudeski (Bruce Willis) is an old-fashioned hit
man: He doesn't sweat rubbing someone out, and he sleeps just fine
at night.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody who stops sleeping well is sad-sack dentist Nicholas
``Oz'' Oseransky (Matthew Perry). That's because Jimmy has moved in
next door in Oz's Montreal neighborhood, sporting an alias. When Oz
susses the killer's true identity, his shrew of a wife, Sophie
(Rosanna Arquette, working an amusingly grating Quebecois accent),
insists that he fly to Chicago, Jimmy's old stomping ground. Maybe
he can get a ``finder's fee'' for ratting Jimmy out to the guy's
mortal enemy, Hungarian crime lord Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak,
making the most of his accent, too).
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention that this is a comedy? The movie takes care of
laughs in its first half-hour by letting Perry do a bunch of
pratfalls (which he does expertly), but the script seems too
familiar. Luckily, as the plot kicks in, ``Yards'' gets better and
funnier, delivering enough twists (in plot and character
revelations) to overcome its tired premise.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes the statuesque Natasha Henstridge as Willis'
estranged wife, Cynthia; Oscar nominee Michael Clarke Duncan (``The
Green Mile'') as one of Janni's strongmen; and, in the movie's
funniest example of derailing our expectations, Amanda Peet as Oz's
perky dental assistant, who turns out to have an unexpected hobby.
They all get involved in a complex series of moves and
countermoves, centered on possession of a $10 million fortune that
Jimmy, Cynthia and Janni all have claim to. Each of them, natch,
wants to nab the full amount, the whole nine yards of the title.
Oh, and they each want to get rich without getting whacked.
Screenwriter Mitchell Kapner provides a witty touch by having Oz's
profession be not only a running joke, but a crucial plot point.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jonathan Lynn (``My Cousin Vinny'') keeps the comedy
rolling smoothly, pulling off the difficult task of keeping things
funny even as the movie starts racking up a sizable body count. (By
contrast, look at the way ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' turns into a mess in
its final reel.)
</P>
<P>
   As in ``The Sixth Sense,'' Willis doesn't seem to mind playing
genial straight man to his funnier cast mates. Perry strikes the
right balance between verbal and physical comedy. Henstridge
doesn't get a chance to be much more than the Girl, but Arquette
makes the most of an opportunity to mock her own sexy image. The
movie's nicest surprise is Peet, but if I spoiled it by telling you
why, you'd want to whack me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whole Nine Yards''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis. Rated R for sexuality,
nudity and violence. At metro theaters.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A comedy with a body count and a familiar premise,
but with enough twists to overcome its familiarity.

NO BLISS IN MARITAL `STORY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `THE STORY OF US'
</P>
<P>
   This movie's married couple seems to have big problems. But the
real problems are with the movie itself.
</P>
<P>
   Director Rob Reiner tries to meld drama and comedy but misfires
on both counts. His look at love on the rocks mixes crude humor
with the tone of television's ``Once and Again,'' with weepy
sensitivity intercut by the stars' confessionals to an unseen
listener.
</P>
<P>
   If only Katie (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Ben (Bruce Willis)
confided more in each other. They don't try hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   He's a clownish slob, and she's a dutiful neatnick, but they
seem to be deeply in love. As Rocky might say, they fill each
other's gaps.
</P>
<P>
   But for some reason, they allow trifles to come between them and
let stubbornness turn molehills into mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In short, you grow impatient with them as much as you pull for
them to pull it together.
</P>
<P>
   Overly anecdotal, the yarn zaps around in time, and its earliest
flashbacks are shaky. Pfeiffer can pass for younger than her 41
years, but Willis, when playing a comb-over 20-something, looks
exactly his age of 44.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reiner is poking us in the ribs with strained
sitcom-style moments that are too crude for the serious context.
</P>
<P>
   Most offensive are the uniformly blunt and irritating co-stars _
Paul Reiser, Rita Wilson and Reiner himself _ who overact badly as
the couple's unlikely friends. (You wouldn't want any of these
people in your face.).
</P>
<P>
   Yet the most awkward element is at the end, when the film's
theatrical trailer suddenly appears, almost in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   The clip is an effective funny-sad montage set against Mason
Williams' urgent ``Classical Gas.'' But to put the trailer in the
movie? Like Ben and Katie's split, it just doesn't feel right.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 1 1/2 stars.

</P>
<P>
   `THE MUSE'
</P>
<P>
   Albert Brooks is like the child you want to encourage, even when
he keeps falling on his face. He once aced tests and won football
games, but now he keeps fumbling the ball.
</P>
<P>
   As writer, director and star, Brooks has created charmingly
offbeat comedies with a real-life edge, from ``Real Life'' to
``Lost in America'' to ``Defending Your Life.''
</P>
<P>
   But his last film, 1996's ``Mother,'' was a poor relation, and
this one isn't much better.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is fun: A zestful woman (Sharon Stone) who claims to
be a goddess serves as muse for frantic Hollywood types seen in
cameos (Martin Scorsese, James Cameron).
</P>
<P>
   But Brooks simply takes that premise into a mundane comedy of
misery. He portrays a once-respected but now struggling
screenwriter who hooks up with Stone as a last resort. She moves
into his house, becoming absurdly high-maintenance while dispensing
common-sense advice that he interprets as brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   The pathetic, desperate Brooks bows to Stone's every whim, and
the nonsense goes on and on _ and on.
</P>
<P>
   Like his character, Brooks just isn't delivering the goods
anymore. Perhaps he needs to study this film and its failure and
think real hard _ unless he knows a true muse who can help.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 1/2 star.

 &HT;    Bush has gone from free agent to religious-right mouthpiece
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Phil Gramm, I was missing you so.
</P>
<P>
   For a Texas pundit, Gramm is like a mountain spring, always
there when the canteen rattles.
</P>
<P>
   When most of us were at a word loss for what happened on the way
to George W. Bush's inauguration, Gramm gurgled this:
</P>
<P>
   ``No Texan has ever done well in New Hampshire. Those people
expect candidates to grovel. Texans have many skills. Groveling
isn't one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Grovel'' is a good Gramm word. Very guttural.
</P>
<P>
   And what a man to bring up the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Texans too proud to grovel? In 1996 Gramm prostrated himself
before the religious right in a quest for the GOP presidential
nomination. His gain? After a staggering defeat in Louisiana, Gramm
was out of the race before he was off his knees.
</P>
<P>
   And now, who's hugging the floor in deference to the Christian
Coalition but George Bush?
</P>
<P>
   No one was in a better position, as a well-endowed,
well-endorsed candidate, to tell Coalition founder Pat Robertson to
go to hell, figuratively speaking.
</P>
<P>
   The last person you'd expect Bush to cozy up to would be the
airwaves kingmaker who sees a king in the mirror. Bush has openly
warred with the Christian Coalition for control of the Texas
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas isn't South Carolina after a stunning primary loss.
What disbelieving eyes are seeing, as the anointed GOP front-runner
struggles to right his vessel, is Bush in Robertson's servitude.
</P>
<P>
   Here we had Bush defending the character of the organization
against the criticisms of John McCain. McCain has ample reason to
criticize. Robertson effectively has called McCain a stalking horse
for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   This is fascinating because on the key social issues for the
religious right, particularly on abortion, they show scant
difference. One difference: McCain hasn't groveled.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference: McCain appears to be consistent, while Bush
is posing for voters in fuzz focus.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's debate, McCain pointed out that he and Bush both
support exceptions to a ban on abortion including cases of rape,
incest and the threat to a mother's life. Yet, McCain pointed out,
Bush supports the GOP platform, which would require a woman
impregnated by a rapist to bear the rapist's child.
</P>
<P>
   Either his rival hasn't read the platform, as McCain implied, or
Bush is just trying to play off as many sides as he can while
hoping that no one pays too close attention.
</P>
<P>
   As the religious right insists, the abortion issue has turned a
lot of GOP candidates once torn about abortion into springtime
zealots.
</P>
<P>
   No better example exists than Gramm. I remember asking him to
express a position _ any position _ on abortion a few years ago,
without success. Then Gramm ran for president and became, with the
Christian Coalition holding his coat, the most fervent
anti-abortion crusader imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is clear. Agents of zeal are crucial to winning
primaries and caucuses, be they Christian evangelicals or labor
unions. They are so crucial, apparently, that someone who won
distinction as a centrist and a consensus-seeker, like Bush, feels
he must abandon the middle and embrace extremists when the going
gets tough.
</P>
<P>
   What does the middle say about abortion? In the 1996 primaries,
exit poll after exit poll found a Republican majority opposing a
constitutional ban on abortion. This even as GOP candidates, with
an eye to the religious right, called for exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Democrats of the 1980s were the party in the throes
of ideological extremes when it came to electing presidents, so
today are the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can still win in South Carolina. The abdication of the hunt
by Steve Forbes may be his saving grace.
</P>
<P>
   Should Bush win the nomination, however, he has some groveling
to do to get back to the center.

`BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE': STRUGGLING TO RECONNECT WHAT CHAOS RIPS APART
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Beautiful People'' ends in a flurry of rapid cuts, with a
series of perfectly ordinary moments: a man reads a picture book to
a child; a family sets out on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wedding party, a birthday party and a raucous game of
cards around a hospital bed. Jasmin Dizdar's camera hurtles through
these scenes like a child in a toy store, grabbing at every detail
as though it were a shiny, precious prize.
</P>
<P>
   The screen hums with the vital cacophony of daily life, and
glows with the thick, bright colors of human emotion _ unspeakable
pain, inexplicable loss and sheer irrational pleasure at being
alive.
</P>
<P>
   And then the whiplash motion abruptly stops, as though
interrupted, and the last thing we see before the credits roll is a
wedding band on the hand of one of the card players. The ring comes
to us as a found image, but it is also a resonant symbol of one of
the movie's main themes: the desire for connection.
</P>
<P>
   The final sequence is so powerful because the movie, which
follows a scattered agglomeration of characters through
multicultural London, has been unsparing in its attention to the
ways human connections can fail.
</P>
<P>
   The man with the wedding ring is in the hospital because, in the
movie's opening scene, he was involved in a fistfight on a London
bus. All we ever learn about him is that he is a Croat, and his
antagonist, whom Britain's mischievous National Health Service
bureaucracy has assigned to a neighboring bed, is a Serb from the
same Bosnian village _ unless it's the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you're a Serb and he's a Croat?'' their kindly, officious
nurse inquires, trying to discover why one has repeatedly tried to
disconnect the other's oxygen lines and intravenous hookups. ``No,
no, no,'' her patient protests. ``It's completely different. I am
Croat and he is Serb.'' And then, like schoolboys, they fall to
arguing over who started it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful People,'' which takes place in 1993, acknowledges
both the fundamental ridiculousness of the Bosnian civil war and
its unassimilable horror. In another part of the same hospital, a
young refugee in the late stages of pregnancy begs her obstetrician
to kill the baby she is carrying, one conceived when she was
gang-raped by Serbian soldiers. When the baby is born, its mother
and her husband will name her Chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Later a BBC foreign correspondent, tormented by survivor's guilt
after his return from Srebrenica, storms into a hospital demanding
that someone amputate his leg. ``I hope your mother and father end
up in a U.N. safe haven,'' he says bitterly to the policeman who
sends him home.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist is soon told he's suffering from a disorder
called Bosnia syndrome, which is basically Stockholm syndrome in
reverse: a tendency to identify, morbidly and irrationally, with
the victims of catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Not that London itself doesn't offer ample opportunities for
heartbreak. The doctor who tries to help the rape victim and her
husband is powerless to stop the collapse of his own marriage. The
headmaster of the school that the doctor's children attend cannot
fathom why his son has taken up heroin and hooliganism.
</P>
<P>
   And another doctor, in love with one of her patients _ also a
refugee from the Balkan slaughter _ must confront the snobbery and
prejudice of her stuffy conservative family.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this movie, which arranges torn lives into a gaudy collage
of misery, is anything but grim. Its title _ at once sarcastic and
entirely sincere _ recalls ``High Hopes'' and ``Life Is Sweet,''
Mike Leigh's mordant anatomies of social and familial dysfunction
in late-Thatcherite London.
</P>
<P>
   Like Leigh in those films, Dizdar cuts between disparate and
complementary stories to get at the density and complexity of
contemporary urban life.
</P>
<P>
   But even in his first feature film Dizdar, a naturalized British
citizen who grew up in Bosnia and studied filmmaking in Prague,
directs with extraordinary exuberance and self-confidence, in a
style that combines documentary realism with a playful,
improvisatory sense of formal possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful People'' is not perfect. Because it is so heavily
populated, some of its characters are rather thinly drawn, and some
of its stories forced to unlikely conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the upper and lower extremes of the British class system,
the toffs and the yobs, so to speak, Dizdar's eye for the
particularities of character weakens, and he falls back on
stereotypes. But the actors _ none of them beautiful in the usual
movie star way, and few of them likely to be familiar to American
audiences _ manage to play even the sketchier parts of Dizdar's
script with intelligence and grace.
</P>
<P>
   A few false notes are to be expected in a composition of such
expansiveness and ambition. For all the sorrow it confronts,
``Beautiful People'' is, in the end, a boisterous love song _ a
funny valentine to London, to chaos and to human decency.
</P>
<P>
   `Beautiful People' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of intense brutality and
drug use.

   McCAIN-BUSH (Greenville, S.C.) _ John McCain, likening himself
to Ronald Reagan, appeals to Democrats and independents to join
Republicans to deliver him a victory in Saturday's crucial GOP
primary. Meanwhile, George W. Bush, campaigning in Florence, S.C.,
accuses McCain of riding a ``high horse on a low road'' by
continuing to distribute a flyer that says Bush's tax cut plan
would damage the future of Social Security. The latest polls show
the two in a statistical dead heat with turnout the likely

George W. Bush but also the whole Republican establishment,
including the party hierarchy and GOP leadership in Congress. By

agenda is drawing distinctions between him and John McCain. By DAN
FREEDMAN.

   McCAIN-VIETNAM (Columbia, S.C.) _ John McCain once said of his
wartime captors in Vietnam: ``I hate those gooks and I always

him _ not the Vietnamese people. Also, McCain says he is
``unstoppable'' if he wins South Carolina. By CLAY ROBISON and R.G.

`HANGING UP': CELL PHONE FROLICS, AND DEAR, DITSY DAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's clear that Eve Marks (Meg Ryan), a harried professional
party planner, has reached the end of her rope when she arrives
home one day to find a big shaggy dog munching on the telephone and
doesn't have an instant conniption. Eve, who practically lives on
the phone, hastily retrieves the instrument, then thinks twice and
tosses it back to the insatiable pooch, who resumes his meal while
she dashes around her fancy Los Angeles house ripping every phone
and fax connection out of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The doggie with the telephone is one of many desperately
lighthearted Hallmark moments in ``Hanging Up,'' a chilly
machine-tooled comedy adapted from Delia Ephron's 1995 novel and
directed by Diane Keaton. Frustrated cell phone communication among
the major characters is such a naggingly unfunny recurrent gag in
the film that by the time it's over, you wish that dog had devoured
every telephone on the set ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   With a screenplay by the author and her sister Nora Ephron (who
produced the movie), ``Hanging Up'' tackles the touchiest of
subjects, the decline and death of a parent, and efficiently
Ephronizes it into a series of cute, easy-to-swallow
pseudo-epiphanies. By the end of the story, the three daughters who
come together over the death of their irascible, alcoholic father
have transcended their simmering mutual resentments long enough to
indulge in a cheery Thanksgiving Day food fight where they
laughingly pour flour over one another's expensive outfits.
Liberation, in this ready-for-Lifetime movie, apparently means not
having to fret about your laundry bills.
</P>
<P>
   Eve ( Ryan) is the married middle daughter of a triumvirate that
includes Georgia ( Keaton), a high-powered magazine editor who
resembles a younger, softer-edged Gloria Steinem, and Maddy (Lisa
Kudrow), an insecure, budding soap opera actress. Their father, Lou
(Walter Matthau), a once successful screenwriter, is a crusty,
wisecracking old geezer who is rapidly losing his marbles from
drinking and age but still has plenty of fighting spirit. In other
words, he is Matthau as a grumpy older man.
</P>
<P>
   As Lou, whose biggest claim to fame was writing movies for John
Wayne, slips from absent-minded senescence into a coma, the movie
cooks up assorted tepid dramas to keep his three daughters in a
tizzy. Eve is arranging a big bash for a women's commerce
organization at the Richard M. Nixon Memorial Library, a sure-fire
comic site that the movie woefully underexploits for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   She is less than pleased when the organization's leaders
unanimously decide Georgia should be the party's keynote speaker
and miffed when Georgia's speech turns out to be a spontaneous,
weepy reflection on their father's death. Since Eve has been his
primary caretaker, she feels Georgia has appropriated and exploited
her grief in the same way that many years earlier she stole her
recipe for stuffing and published it in The New York Times. Of such
mountains are the movie's emotional molehills built.
</P>
<P>
   Eve is that familiar Meg Ryan alter ego, an officiously perky
wonder woman whose take-charge attitude masks a daddy's-little-girl
vulnerability. Georgia is that comforting cliche, the professional
dynamo with an empathetic heart palpitating under a gregarious but
steely surface. Maddy is the slightly lost baby of the family who
feels ignored and underappreciated. Ryan, Keaton and Kudrow do
their best to give these one-dimensional women some depth, but
they're struggling against a screenplay that reduces deep emotions
into low-cal, risk-free hissy fits that can be settled with a
misty-eyed hug.
</P>
<P>
   Using extended flashbacks and reveries, the movie tries to pack
as much biographical information as possible into 92 minutes, but
its very busyness ensures that the characters' feelings stay on the
surface. The closest the movie comes to real drama is a flashback
in which Lou drunkenly disrupts a children's birthday party. Its
primary indication of the passage of time is that Ryan's blond hair
keeps getting shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows, few events in life are more emotionally loaded
than the death of a parent. As sugarcoated and joke-encrusted as it
may have been, ``One True Thing,'' sparked by Meryl Streep's
astonishing portrayal of a dying cancer patient, stirred up enough
genuine human drama to qualify as a triple-hankie movie.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hanging Up,'' with its squalling cell phones and deathbed
Hollywood jokes about John Wayne and June Allyson, meeting your
maker is just another way of meeting cute. Give the movie half a
hankie.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Hanging Up'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It has some off-color humor and profanity.
</P>
<P>

WORDS AND DEEDS: WHAT JEFFERSON WROTE WILL OUTLAST WHAT HE DID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some words speak louder than action. Take, for example, these
enduring words that have echoed down through the generations of
this republic: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident that all
men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and
the pursuit of Happiness ...''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing that Thomas Jefferson did or neglected to do in his
private life or public service added to or detracted from the
potency of those profound and poignant syllables.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter, for example, that Jefferson took unto himself
a mistress of mixed white and black extraction and fathered
children by her, as depicted by the TV miniseries that ran on one
of the major networks this week. The words endure.
</P>
<P>
   It does not matter if there was a mutual sharing of affection
between Jefferson and Sally Hemings, or if the relationship was
only a case of a slave woman submitting to the desires of her
owner.
</P>
<P>
   The words of the Declaration of Independence endure and set
forth the bedrock ideal of American civilization. Even though a
slave owner who consorted with one of his female chattel wrote
them, their power was irresistible. They projected the abiding
principle that led ultimately to the abolition of slavery and of
codified racial segregation in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Because some people discern hypocrisy in Jefferson's having
owned slaves and having slept with at least one of them, they have
suggested that the Sage of Monticello really didn't intend those
words to mean what they say. But the fact is that Jefferson
included much stronger language condemning slavery in the original
draft of the Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Those condemnations were removed from the final draft at the
insistence of Southern slave masters and Northern maritime
profiteers. And Jefferson still did not make the language neutral
enough for them. Many of that ilk realized that the Declaration was
a strong indictment of slavery and lambasted against it for years.
</P>
<P>
   On several other occasions, Jefferson used his pen and the
authority of his office to strike out against slavery. For example,
in 1784 he proposed an ordinance that would have prohibited slavery
in all the new territories between the Appalachian Mountains and
the Mississippi River after 1800. That Northwest Ordinance failed
by one vote in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to that defeat, Jefferson wrote: ``The voice of a
single individual ... would have prevented this abominable crime
from spreading itself over the new country. Thus we see the fate of
millions unborn hanging on the tongue of one man, and Heaven was
silent in that awful moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Enduring words! One of his first acts in the Virginia
Legislature was to try to push through legislation to overturn a
law prohibiting inheritors of slaves from freeing them. In his
will, he did arrange for freedom for many of his slaves. But he was
too deeply in debt to free them all. Jefferson did make some
observations in his ``Notes on Virginia'' concerning the mental and
physical characteristics of blacks that from today's perspective
might be assessed as bigoted.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that blacks were deficient in depth of reasoning,
while saying that ``in memory they are equal to whites'' and that
``in music they are more generally gifted.'' Nevertheless, he
conceded that his assessments were based only upon that limited
information on the subject available at that time and upon daily
observations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion that they are inferior in the faculties of reason
and imagination must be hazarded with great diffidence,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   There are two schools of thought on Jefferson's 38-year
relationship with Sally Hemings. One holds that she was simply
exploited as a sex object, as was the case with most slave owners
and their black concubines. The other school holds that there was
mutual affection and respect in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The TV miniseries, a fitting Black History Month offering, makes
the latter assumption, which makes for a better story. And it's a
credible theory because Hemings is said to have been a dead ringer
for Jefferson's deceased wife, Martha.
</P>
<P>
   The resemblance was natural because Sally Hemings was Martha
Skelton Jefferson's half sister, both having shared the same
father. And Sally's mother was half-white. That made Sally a
quadroon, or what African-Americans used to refer to as ``light,
bright and damned-near white.''
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries is well-done. It brooks favorable comparison to
``Roots.'' It projects the hideous reality of slavery palatably and
treats America's third president and the author of the Declaration
of Independence as a man of wisdom and dignity with warts. But
whatever the impression of Jefferson the viewers are left with ...
the words endure.

THE COLOR OF EMPTINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The science-fiction thriller ``Pitch Black'' may be about a
planet that's immersed in darkness, but director David Twohy always
makes sure you have something to look at. Twohy and his crew put a
lot of thought into the visuals of this movie, half of which
actually takes place in daylight _ the harshest, whitest daylight
Twohy and cinematographer David Eggby can manage. Colors leach out,
faces distort, and at night, alien creatures become
glow-in-the-dark blurs.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't look like too many other movies. But it sure feels
like you've seen it before.
</P>
<P>
   Twohy, who delivered a nifty little science-fiction cult film
with 1996's ``The Arrival,'' gets ``Pitch Black'' off to a rousing
start with a spaceship crash punctuated with nerve-rattling
strobe-light flashes and furiously hyperactive editing. After the
dust settles, we're left with a motley crew of characters stranded
on a desert planet with three suns, and it's only a matter of time
before something starts making their stay unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   The key characters are a docking pilot named Fry (Radha
Mitchell), a macho lawman named Johns (Cole Hauser) and a convicted
murderer named Riddick (Vin Diesel, also on view this week in
``Boiler Room'').
</P>
<P>
   There are others _ most notably a Muslim cleric (Keith David)
and a fey antiques dealer (Lewis Fitz-Gerald) _ but Fry, Riddick
and Johns provide most of the bickering ... er, ``tension.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are bad enough already when the survivors discover that
the planet is inhabited by some nasty batlike creatures and some
even nastier ``Alien''-like creatures, each of which has a nose for
blood, a taste for human flesh and an inability to withstand light.
So everything is OK for our heroes as long as they stay in the sun,
right? Whaddaya think the odds are that they crashed hours before a
rare solar eclipse?
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Blair Witch Project,'' ``Pitch Black'' is meant to
play upon our childhood fear of the dark, not to mention our adult
fear of handheld shaky-cams. And Twohy's skewed visuals are
unnerving _ at first. But once you focus in on the characters, and
realize that you'd rather see (and maybe even root for) the
monsters, it becomes tough to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell plays spunky while modeling the latest in
midriff-bearing spacewear. Diesel, Hauser and Fitz-Gerald get their
share of macho and/or dry one-liners. Other characters wait to be
plucked off like secondary ``Star Trek'' guest stars. And everybody
gets a piece of dialogue along the lines of ``We've got to get off
of this rock!''
</P>
<P>
   It's passably entertaining, and genre fans who thought the
previews were cool probably won't be disappointed with Twohy's
warped imagery. But the script lifts from so many other sources
that it quickly becomes apparent ``Pitch Black'' was a good idea
with no other good ideas to back it up. It just doesn't stand up in
the cold light of day.

MAKING FUN OF BOY BANDS SHOULD BE MORE FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have seen my share of bad movies but few, if any, prepared me
for the utter, complete, sometimes cringe-inducing mess that is
``2gether,'' MTV's parody of the boy-band phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   And what is so disappointing is that the idea and the timing are
so right.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync have sold, between them, more
than 20 million CDs in less than two years, almost exclusively to
little girls who love their fresh-scrubbed good looks and endless
stream of bland, first-makeout-session-friendly, faux-soulful tunes
about the vagaries of teen romance.
</P>
<P>
   This music is, for the most part, dreck: hollow, dumbed-down and
marketed with ruthless efficiency, which is certainly a winning
formula for much of what is successful in pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Point being, the current crop of cutie-pie boy bands is ripe for
the picking; they practically beg to be made fun of, as did heavy
metal in the '80s and hip-hop in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for ``2gether,'' the first film from MTV's
Original TV Movies division, parodies of both of those genres _
``Spinal Tap'' and ``Fear of a Black Hat'' _ have set a standard
that director Nigel Dick and ``writers'' Brian and Mark Gunn never
come close to reaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spinal'' and ``Fear'' were gleefully vicious in their
disassembling of bloated metal bands a la Uriah Heep and the
mechanizations behind flash-in-the-pan hip-hop acts. They pulled no
punches and got the details right _ and seeing just how close they
could come to the real thing was at least half the fun, if not
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``2gether'' can't decide whether it wants to be sweet or nasty
and mainly chooses the former, dumbing down its subject matter and
undercutting whatever glib knowingness (which is to say, value as a
parody) it might have had as a result. Dick and the Gunn brothers
want to make us laugh at boy bands, but they refuse to go in for
the kill (or to get a lot of details right) and end up oozing as
much vanilla as the wussy music they're trying to thumb their
collective nose at.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins with music manager Bob Buss (Alan Blumenfeld)
getting fired from his job with chart-topping boy band Whoa! on the
eve of a big show in Boston. And it is only here, as
Buss/Blumenfeld explains the makeup of boy bands (you have to have
the rebel, the cutie, the shy one, the older brother and the
heartthrob) that the film works.
</P>
<P>
   This takes approximately five minutes, and the next 77 are a
wash. The plot, such as it is, involves Buss wanting to assemble a
boy-band within a week so he can open for Whoa! in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   So we're treated to a road trip, a trip to a karaoke bar, a
jealous girlfriend, coming up with the band name _ 2gether, of
course _ a disastrous first gig, a defection among the ranks, a
chance meeting in an all-night truck stop with the guys in Whoa!
(gosh, they're jerks _ ``can you believe it?!?!?)'' and
(ohmygoshnoWAY!) a triumphant show.
</P>
<P>
   Please. The dialogue is dreadful, the acting more so. Only Alex
Solowitz as the Kid Rock-ish ``rebel'' Mickey Parke seems to really
commit himself to his role _ which is, basically, being a
pseudo-playa moron. How hard could this have been?
</P>
<P>
   There are more holes in the plot than in the Dallas Cowboys'
offensive line. How, for example, would a fat, balding guy such as
Doug Linus (Kevin Farley; yep, Chris' brother) even be
``considered'' for such a group? There are more ridiculous gaffes _
one near the end involving the girlfriend and a tape of 2gether
songs that made me laugh out loud _ but you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Also undercutting the film's premise is that almost all of the
major characters stop what they're doing and explain what's going
on TO THE CAMERA. This is a huge parody no-no; we're never told who
this camera crew is or why they would following around an
unemployed former manager as he tries desperately to rebuild his
career. The film would have been much better _ and far, far more
believable _ without this treatment. As it is, it's just something
else that takes away from the believability of the entire project.
</P>
<P>
   The film does have one might-have-been-redeeming quality: The
music itself. Songs such as ``Say It (Don't Spray It)'' and
2gether's big hit ``U + Me Us (Calculus).'' Both are just about
perfect in their cookie-cutter blandness but both, unfortunately,
underscore just how unrealized the film around them is.
</P>
<P>
   MTV is obviously trying to show us how hip it is for parodying
the very acts it has helped to become enormously wealthy, but it
drops the ball early and often. ``2gether'' just isn't convincing
and smartly snarky enough to do what it sets out to do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``2gether''
</P>
<P>
   Monday: 7 p.m. on MTV. The film will run commercial-free. A
soundtrack album of 10 original songs is available now.

HOST OF NPR'S `MARKETPLACE' FUMBLES ON DOCUMENTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm a big fan of ``Marketplace,'' National Public Radio's
business news show.
</P>
<P>
   The award-winning show is informative, snappy, humorous and
human, and after listening to it for a half-hour, you pretty much
know all the big business news of the day and have probably picked
up a few smaller gems to share with your spouse at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   So I was looking forward to reading the new book by David
Brancaccio, the host and senior editor of ``Marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Brancaccio makes his show lively, entertaining and informative.
He takes what many consider dry, boring news and gives it an
``Entertainment Tonight'' spin.
</P>
<P>
   And he is a seasoned newsman with a master's degree in
journalism from Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   So I am disappointed to confess that I wasn't bowled over with
``Squandering Aimlessly: My Adventures in the American
Marketplace,'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 283 pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   His premise was good. Brancaccio tells readers that the book
idea came about because in his high-profile job, (''Marketplace''
has 3.7 million listeners), people constantly ask him what they
should do with their extra money.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a time of great surplus for some, this is an acute
occupational hazard, like that of the chiropractor at a convention
of contortionists,'' he writes. ``I need to answer the question for
myself before I could have anything meaningful to say about other
people's money.''
</P>
<P>
   So Brancaccio took off, literally, to find his financial
``street smarts.'' He took 10 trips over 16 months to discover what
to do with that bonus, severance check, inheritance, lottery win,
tax refund or other capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   He chose 10 categories on which to base his trips: taking a
shopping spree, doing good, starting a business, gambling, giving
it away, investing in the markets, buying a house, going back to
school, retiring early and saving for a rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   His trips included a day of shopping at Minnesota's Mall of
America; a talk with socially responsible investors in Jackson
Hole, Wyo.; gambling and talking with two former professional
gamblers in Las Vegas; visiting Wall Street; attending classes at a
country music school in Levelland, Texas; and hanging out at the
Biosphere in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The travelogue is interesting to a point, but the book lacks
basic research to bolster its premise. Brancaccio goes to the mall,
for example, but doesn't tell readers how big it is or how much
consumers are spending annually at malls or how much square footage
of retail space there is per person in this country (an
astronomical number, by the way, compared with 20 years ago).
</P>
<P>
   At the country music school in Levelland, he found many
interesting characters who abandoned solid careers for an almost
whimsical lifestyle. Yet Brancaccio doesn't mention how many people
nationally have returned to school for a career change or even how
many are enrolled in South Plains College, one of the few places
that offers a degree in country music.
</P>
<P>
   Without much work, you can find statistics and analyses on just
about anything. If Brancaccio had backed his stories with numbers,
his book would have been far more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   A classic example of how an author can engrossingly entwine
travel with big-picture analysis is Bill Bryson's ``A Walk in the
Woods,'' about his experience walking the Appalachian Trail.
Besides the fascinating, detailed account of his walking
experience, Bryson crams the book with more historic,
environmental, social and scientific information than anyone can
remember but that adds eye-widening appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Brancaccio has not provided much of a big picture, and that
leaves the reader wanting much more.
</P>
<P>
   Next time you go on the road, Brancaccio, take a researcher with
you, and don't forget to plug in the numbers.

BROODING `SUICIDE PACT' A BRIGHT SPOT IN HARD ROCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question surrounding Therapy? and its latest CD, the
just-released ``Suicide Pact _ You First,'' is not whether it's one
of the best hard-rock records of the past five years (it surely
is), but whether it will get the airing it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   For those who remember, the band _ born 10 years ago in Belfast,
Northern Ireland _ was briefly on the cusp of stardom in the United
States, thanks to the success of 1992's ``Nurse'' and 1994's
``Troublegum'' CDs, tours with the Rollins Band, Helmet, Jesus
Lizard and Swervedriver, and a growing horde of fans who loved the
nasty, snarling, compact songs of vocalist/guitarist/lyricist Andy
Cairns.
</P>
<P>
   Therapy? was that rare combination of intelligent lyrics,
vicious metallic attack and pop smarts, born of the same sort of
lust for The Big Riff and the confessional anger and sadness that
fueled Husker Du, Joy Division and Big Black. For one brief moment
_ amid the buzz that surrounded ``Troublegum,'' still one of my top
five hard-rock records _ they grasped the brass ring.
</P>
<P>
   And then it all went _ well, if not south, then certainly
sideways. According to Cairns, that CD was a ``one-off'' pop record
_ if pop records can include songs about knife wounds, paralyzing
frustration, murder fantasies and utter, black despair.
</P>
<P>
   Their label, A&AMP;M, wanted hits, but they wanted to make darker,
more interesting records. As a result, the next CD, ``Infernal
Love,'' got no push at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't know how to market us; Green Day and Offspring
were big at the time,'' Cairns says by phone from London. ``And
they wanted us to compete with Metallica and Aerosmith! We were
treading water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Infernal Love'' bombed in the United States, and its
follow-up, 1998's ``Semi-Detached,'' was released just as A&AMP;M was
being absorbed into Polygram via its merger with Seagram's.
</P>
<P>
   It was never released in the United States and didn't fare that
well in Europe, where the band has always been more popular.
Therapy? found itself without a label, and with a not-so-great CD
in the racks and no profile in the States. Cairns had been a very
hard partier, but he eased back, cut down and fell in love with a
woman named Kristina. The band made ready to record again _ it just
didn't know for whom.
</P>
<P>
   But the day they began recording ``Suicide'' in England, they
signed a worldwide deal with Ark 21, a wide-ranging label that's
also home to Austin's Wayne ``The Train'' Hancock. A new lease on
life beckoned, and they banged out ``Suicide'' in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just decided we might as well just wipe the slate clean and
do what we wanted to do,'' Cairns says. ``We made a very noisy,
garage-y, underground record, and it was great fun. We just worked
on instinct, tossed about some lyrics, and didn't try to steer the
songs somewhere they weren't meant to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Suicide'' is an expansive, articulate, roaring beast of a CD,
hard rock for people who think and prefer real life to fantasy.
Martin McCarrick's cello and second guitar are integrated into the
songs better than on ``Infernal Love'' or ``Semi-Detached,'' and
the songs have a dark, brooding tone; it's easily their best work
since ``Troublegum,'' although far different, and will probably end
up on my top 10 list for the best CDs of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal with Ark 21 means that the band will once again
tour the United States with an intensity not seen since 1995.
Cairns, married for more than a year, just celebrated the birth of
his first child, Jonah, in October, and says he's put the days of
``just going from one party to another'' behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a single man, I'd worry 24 hours a day about music. Now
that I have other things in life, I make the most of my creative
time,'' he says. ``I've sorted myself out, and I've totally gotten
back into music.''
</P>
<P>
   The first signs of Therapy?'s rebirth are the release of
``Suicide'' and a showcase set at South by Southwest in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to start from scratch in America,'' he says.
``What I'd like to do is establish a true fan base, have small
places rammed full of fans, make a lot of friends, do it the honest
way. All of our favorite bands are American _ we're not trying to
resell you something you've already got.''

`BOILER ROOM': SELL ENOUGH DICEY STOCKS TO RUBES, AND YOU CAN BUY
FERRARIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About a third of the way into ``Boiler Room,'' Seth Davis
(Giovanni Ribisi), a young stockbroker-in-training at a
fly-by-night company called J.T. Marlin, drops by a co-worker's
house for an evening of pizza and beer.
</P>
<P>
   The house, a huge, expensive stucco affair somewhere on Long
Island, is completely unfurnished except for a tanning machine, a
leather couch and a big-screen television set, around which the
power players of hard-sell stock trading, all men in their early to
mid-20s, are gathered. They are watching a tape of ``Wall Street,''
and it's clearly a movie they've seen many times before, since they
all seem to have the whole script committed to memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room,'' written and directed by Ben Younger, 29, is
both an homage to Oliver Stone's 1987 fable of innocence corrupted
by avarice and a critique of it. The baby sharks of J.T. Marlin
like to play Gordon Gekko karaoke, bloviating along with Michael
Douglas' mephistophelean arbitrageur and mocking his windy
grandiosity. Compared to them, though, the reptilian Gekko is a
great intellectual and a devoted humanitarian. His mantra, ``greed
is good,'' strikes a sententious, faintly absurd note in the amoral
world of ``Boiler Room,'' in which greed is simply axiomatic.
</P>
<P>
   When Gekko thundered ``I own!'' he meant he controlled large and
consequential pieces of the world: companies, factories, the lives
of thousands of workers. But Jim Young (Ben Affleck) _ Marlin's
designated drill sergeant and, at 27, one of its wise old heads _
prefers to boast about his Ferrari, his mansion and his toys.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gekko, Jim and his conferees, who rake in millions peddling
dicey stocks over the phone to suckers in the hinterlands,
represent the seductive power of unadulterated capitalism. Not that
anyone needs much seducing these days.
</P>
<P>
   Seth's voice-over at the start of the film conjures instant
Microsoft millionaires and lottery winners, and he cites Notorious
B.I.G., the avatar of hip-hop in its high-living, money-loving
``playa'' mode, on the allure of easy money. Seth, a college
dropout who runs an illegal 24-hour casino in his Queens apartment,
knows all the specs on the new Ferrari, even though he's still
driving his mother's Volvo wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Wall Street,'' ``Boiler Room'' tells the story of an
ambitious young man's rise, fall and redemption. And like Charlie
Sheen's Bud Fox, Seth carries some heavy Oedipal baggage _ a
troubled relationship with his demanding, disapproving father (Ron
Rifkin) _ onto the trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   But at its best, which is awfully good, ``Boiler Room'' avoids
the thumping moralism that has made Oliver Stone the least
misunderstood director in Hollywood. It's less about selling your
soul than about feeling your oats.
</P>
<P>
   In its close attention to the hard-sell ethos of buying and
selling, lying and cheating, ``Boiler Room'' calls to mind another
movie its characters occasionally quote, James Foley's 1992
adaptation of David Mamet's play ``Glengarry Glen Ross.'' (At times
it hews a bit too close for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck's role _ to say nothing of his suit, his hair and his
handsome hint of jowliness _ seems to have been traced over the
outline of Alec Baldwin in that earlier movie.) Younger is, like
Mamet, a passionate anthropologist, and he possesses an ear for the
idioms and speech patterns of his chosen subculture that Mamet
might envy.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Marlin, despite the phony blue-blood name, is miles from
Wall Street, somewhere off Exit 53 of the Long Island Expressway,
to be precise. It is populated not by well-connected MBAs but by
outer-borough strivers, sons of the white ethnic middle class
weaned on movies _ ``Goodfellas'' as much as ``Wall Street'' _ and
on rap music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room'' registers how completely the styles and
attitudes of several generations of hip-hop stars, from Slick Rick
to Puff Daddy, have permeated white youth culture. Younger's
filmmaking style, with its fast, fluid cutting and its layered,
improvisatory rhythm, is the perfect visual correlative to the
movie's soundtrack, which boasts a canny mix of old and new school
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   For Seth, selling stocks is ``the white-boy way of slinging
crack rock,'' and he and his crew clearly believe that trading
bogus shares in iffy companies gives them the sexual potency and
outlaw chic of the pimps and drug dealers who are their favorite
archetypes of rap mythology.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys were mackin' it hard,'' Seth marvels when he first
sees the rows of expensive cars in the Marlin parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   He might be talking about the cast of ``Boiler Room.'' Ribisi
uses everything he has _ his creaky voice, his oddly shaped face,
his pallid skin _ to deliver a perfectly balanced, beautifully
nuanced performance. He captures Seth's man-child suavity as well
as his childish sensitivity, and the sweetness underneath his
cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every other performance in the movie is as good as
Ribisi's. Nicky Katt, who played a scarily articulate hit man in
``The Limey,'' is almost unrecognizable here as Greg, a moody,
sarcastic broker who fancies himself Seth's mentor. His performance
is complemented by the work of Vin Diesel, who may be the sexiest
ugly man in movies since Anthony Quinn, and by Scott Caan (son of
James), who plays Sonny Corleone with a broker's license.
</P>
<P>
   Nia Long brings wit and patience to the underwritten role of
Marlin's receptionist and Seth's love interest, a black woman
surrounded by white guys trying to act like homeboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room'' reflects the sensibility of the generation it
holds up to critical scrutiny, and it's a cunningly ambiguous act
of self-portraiture. Younger presents a world ruled by a gang of
lawless, soulless children, like the island of lost boys in ``Peter
Pan.''
</P>
<P>
   But his film also shows us a group of actors, and a filmmaker,
with soul to spare and talent to burn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Boiler Room' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It includes a steady stream of obscenities and
shocking displays of naked greed. &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Confederate flags for everybody
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ People ask what I think about the Confederate
flag flap. I tell them not much.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the truth. I don't spend much time thinking about the
Confederate flag, or what it represents then and now. It neither
inspires nor inflames me. I could say the same about the Lone Star
flag.
</P>
<P>
   The American flag, however, is something else again. I can tear
up singing ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' as I watch Old Glory waving
in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   The more I travel in other parts of the world, the more America
means to me, and the flag for which it stands, indivisible.
</P>
<P>
   What the Confederate flag stands for is what's currently
dividing this nation's people _ meaning as it does, for some, the
heritage of the Old South; for others, the racism of neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Same flag, same flagpole, diverse reactions _ and you ain't just
whistling ``Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   Which sort of brings me to my point. As you may or may not know,
the song of the Old South, ``Dixie,'' was appropriated by Union
forces during the Civil War, such was its stirring strains.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, even today, you'll find these alternative lyrics in
the archives of patriotic songs, the way the North sang it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Way down South in the land of traitors,
</P>
<P>
   ``Rattlesnakes and alligators,
</P>
<P>
   ``Come away, come away, stay away, Dixieland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where cotton's king and men are chattel,
</P>
<P>
   ``Yankee boys must win the battle,
</P>
<P>
   ``Come away, come away, stay away, Dixieland.''
</P>
<P>
   If I had been a Union soldier in the time of the Civil War,
that's the version I would have sung.
</P>
<P>
   And if I were an African-American in these times, I think I
would appropriate the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   Certain modifications, of course, would be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Picture the battle flag of the Confederacy _ blue bars of white
stars crossed on a blood-red field _ which speaks volumes of the
heritage of the Old South.
</P>
<P>
   Now picture the battle flag of the Confederacy _ the same blue
bars, the same white stars, the same blood-red field, but
surrounded by a huge black circle with a slash through it. That
would speak volumes as well.
</P>
<P>
   If I were an African-American, I'd probably fly that flag over
the headquarters of the NAACP, on the grilles of 18-wheelers driven
by black truckers, on the walls of black-owned restaurants and
other private businesses _ all the places where you see the
traditional Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   And even on a separate but equally prominent flagstaff over the
Capitol building of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Would it outrage white Southerners who revere the flag of the
Old South?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. That's the whole idea.
</P>
<P>
   Because if nothing else, it would accomplish this much:
</P>
<P>
   Those white Southerners, who say they can't understand the rage
of African-Americans when the Confederate flag is displayed in
public places, would now know exactly how it feels.

 WE ASKED FOR 'EM, WE GOT 'EM: THOSE READER
IDEAS CAME ROLLING IN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By
KATHY HARRIS c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   The readers have spoken, and they feel strongly about the design
of the Texas quarter, to be introduced in 2004. In a previous
article, we offered some wacky ideas about the upcoming Texas
quarter just for fun, but it's time to get down to business, before
a posse is formed. As promised, here is the top vote-getter from
readers, along with some other ideas (we're impressed!):
</P>
<P>
   1. A longhorn in some form or fashion was the top pick. Caleb
Miller, 13, of Fort Worth even suggested a longhorn standing in a
field of bluebonnets. A perfect combo, Caleb. If only we could get
Lady Bird Johnson to campaign for this one. We also liked the
design turned in by Rick Pinner of Whitney, which combines stars
and a longhorn. It's clean, it's classy, it's TEXAS. Runner-up
artist honors go to Robert Barnes of Fort Worth, who packed more
things on a quarter than seemed humanly possible, including
bluebonnets, a cattle skull, prairie cactus, a lone star, and the
words ``prosperity,'' ``diversity,'' ``industrialization,'' ``Sam
Houston'' and ``Stephen F. Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Sure, we remember the Alamo, and so do you, because it came
in a close second among readers. It's not that we have anything
against the Alamo. We're just not sure there are enough Daughters
of the Republic to guard each quarter if the Alamo makes it onto
the coin. Runner-up to the Alamo was a lone star. OK. It is the
Lone Star State, but do we really want to start a trend of state
quarters reflecting the state nickname? Imagine how obnoxious those
Missouri folks would be, always saying, ``Show me the money.''
</P>
<P>
   3. The Dallas Cowboys may be ``America's Team,'' but several
readers made the case for the real thing on an American quarter.
Mary Anne Miller of Fort Worth conjures up a nice image of a cowboy
on his horse, overlooking a valley full of longhorns. Too bad we
can't capture the Texas sunset or a wide-open blue sky in the
background. No matter. They'll just have to make the Texas
half-dollar, instead. After all, if everything is bigger in Texas,
its coin should be, too.
</P>
<P>
   4. Thinking about cowboys gets us thinking about chuck wagons,
which gets us thinking about corn bread, which gets us thinking
about ... ribs. Sonny Norrell of Fort Worth thought of a plate of
ribs, too. And what better way to wash them down than with a frosty
Big Red? Our state quarter would be the only mouth-watering money
out there!
</P>
<P>
   5. Willard H. Jordan of Mineral Wells points out that one of
America's biggest heroes is from Texas. Audie Murphy, the most
decorated combat soldier at the time of his death in 1971, was born
near Kingston. What better way to remind Americans that they owe
their freedom to servicemen and servicewomen like Murphy than by
putting his face on the Texas quarter.

`KIRIKOU AND THE SORCERESS': CAN-DO AFRICAN BOY WINS AND EVIL
SORCERESS LOSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mother, bring me into the world,'' demands Kirikou, the infant
protagonist of the animated fable ``Kirikou and the Sorceress.''
Like its tiny hero, ``Kirikou'' proceeds at its own pace, and that
pace is a more willful and slower piece of storytelling than
children are accustomed to getting from American animated films, in
which emotional crises are worked out like story problems (if Buzz
and Woody need to get to point A ...).
</P>
<P>
   The director Michel Ocelot's belief in his film is as winning as
his title character's confidence, even though ``Kirikou'' is
probably a story more suitable for younger children than for older
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Kirikou tells his mother when he's ready to be born and then
pops out, a rambunctious can-do charmer who's constitutionally
incapable of being defeated. This fairy tale, based on a West
African legend, sends its indomitable little-boy hero with a ridge
of sculptured hair atop his head on his way to outwit the evil
sorceress Karaba and her minions: grim, obedient fetish objects and
a thirsty beast that consumes all the water in sight.
</P>
<P>
   It's wonderful and rare to see an African landscape rendered for
an animated film and not have any of the characters voiced by white
mainstream American movie stars, or hear any Broadway
approximations of African music. The rhythms of ``Kirikou'' are
aided by the lyric pulse of Youssou N'Dour's score, which lends the
story an airy exuberance. The music does some of Ocelot's work for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Ocelot's style of illustration often uses a regal rigidity. His
characters are frequently captured in profile, rendered as if they
were pictograms created by the artist Romare Bearden. It's a
full-scale delivery of animation with its own cultural imperative.
</P>
<P>
   This gives the movie an odd delicacy, especially in scenes when
``Kirikou'' is most effective, as when Karaba's fetish figures _
blockish and frightening _ charge onto the screen. This scene and
shots of Karaba _ her burning amber eyes match the gold jewelry she
wears, tribute she has forced villagers into surrendering _ have a
haunted serenity, instead of the anarchic pop-pop-pop that even the
most tepid American feature-length cartoons provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kirikou and the Sorceress'' has a modesty of scale that limits
its power, even with the occasional glimpses of fairy-tale horror
(with a primal earthiness reminiscent of ``Princess Mononoke'')
that peek through. The formality of both the dialogue and the
visuals also vaguely suggests the earliest Japanese anime to reach
America, stuff like ``Astro Boy'' or ``Gigantor,'' though stripped
of the action.
</P>
<P>
   It's more a piece to admire than to be involved by, yet it's
easy to imagine children hypnotized by a hero tinier than they are
when ``Kirikou'' is continually loaded into the VCR. &QL;

`PARIAH': ENTERING THE RANKS OF RACISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Pariah,'' which begins a weeklong engagement at the Screening
Room in New York Friday night, opens with the voice of the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. warning that ``racism is a sickness unto
death.'' But this new film by Randolph Kret mistakes the study of a
particularly virulent set of symptoms for a diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the Southern California skinheads who
rampage through the movie are sick people. When they are not
spewing obscenities at blacks, gays and one another or committing
acts of wanton brutality against blacks, gays and one another, they
are apt to be recalling lives of loneliness and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But having discovered these pathologically angry souls, Kret,
who directed ``Pariah'' from his own script, seems unsure about
what to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   What he tries to do is send an outsider into their ugly little
world. Steve (Damon Jones) is a quiet white grad student type whose
world is shattered when the skinheads attack him and his
African-American girlfriend, Sam (Elexa Williams).
</P>
<P>
   Sam, gang-raped while Steve is forced to look on helplessly,
goes home, cuts her wrists and dies. Steve decides to take revenge.
But first he shaves his head, dons red suspenders and an angry
scowl and decorates his arms with Nazi tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of an ordinary, tolerant white person going undercover
into a world of extreme race-hatred is a promising one. (It was the
subject of Costa-Gravas' interesting 1988 film ``Betrayed,''
starring Debra Winger and Tom Berenger.) But to bring the idea to
life requires a script and an actor capable of conveying the
psychological complications such a journey must entail.
</P>
<P>
   Steve's motives are never made very clear. Why didn't he call
the police? (The answer seems to be that Los Angeles, despite being
overrun by gangs of marauding youths who carry out their attacks in
broad daylight, doesn't have any.)
</P>
<P>
   And why, if he's so inclined, doesn't Steve just track his
assailants down and kill them? Why would he want to make friends
with them first? His decision is presented as if it were the most
natural response to what has befallen him and yet on reflection it
seems completely absurd.
</P>
<P>
   For his part Jones, a slow-moving, passive screen presence,
doesn't adequately register the nuances of guilt, rage and
curiosity his character needs to hold our interest or elicit our
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Nuance is not something Kret has much use for. The lives of the
skinheads are so nasty and brutish that it seems hard to imagine
that any young person, however alienated or ideologically zealous,
would want to go near them.
</P>
<P>
   And in a misguided attempt to give the film some political
balance and complexity, Kret conjures up a group of hyped-up,
violent young black men (the only black male characters in the
movie), who drive around the city terrorizing whites and who
introduce gunfire where before there had been bats, fists and
knives. This gang and the mob of vengeful gays who later lay waste
to the skinheads' crash pad are on hand to make the point that the
world is trapped in a cycle of retributive violence.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that ``Pariah'' is a relentlessly violent
film. It is also simplistic, repetitive and morally confused. Kret
clearly wants to generate an atmosphere of assaultive intensity,
but after a while the raised voices and pounding fists induce a
kind of weary numbness.
</P>
<P>
   The only real charge comes from the soundtrack, which features
some terrific songs by antiracist hardcore bands like Minor Threat,
Social Unrest and the Wives.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the attack on Steve and Sam, the scenes of
violence tend to be sloppily filmed and loosely edited, and the
sheer number of them further dilutes their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Matters are not helped by the acting, which ranges from almost
credible (Aimee Chaffin as the chief skinhead's moll; David Lee
Wilson as his sociopathic sidekick) to unwatchable (Ann Zupa as a
neurotic fat girl; Anna Padgett as a skittish junkie; Brandon
Slater as the gang's mentally retarded mascot).
</P>
<P>
   Racist extremism is a problem. We need movies that address it.
Chances are you already agree with these propositions. All
``Pariah'' succeeds in doing is screaming them at you, at maximum
volume, over and over and over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This film is not rated. &QL;

`SHRUB': A TEXAS-STYLE BASHING: DOUBLE-TEAMING `DUBYA' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Shrub,'' the title of this new book about George W. Bush, says
it all: the dismissive nickname, first coined by former Gov. Ann
Richards of Texas, is a tip-off that this isn't going to be a
nonpartisan assessment of this Republican presidential candidate;
it's going to a sassy, sarcastic indictment of Bush and his
policies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the book reads like a long, editorial rant against
Bush's political record, a rant that's sometimes persuasive,
sometimes unfair, if almost always entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Ivins, a columnist for The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and
Lou Dubose, editor of The Texas Observer, make no secret of their
liberal bias in the pages of this book. ``The dirty secret of Texas
government,'' they write, ``is that we keep our `low tax, low
services' tradition going by cheating the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   They depict Bush as a ``wholly owned subsidiary of corporate
America'': ``We don't think this is a consequence of political
calculation; it is more a consequence of his life experience,
political thinking and party affiliation. We can find no evidence
that it has ever occurred to him to question whether it is wise to
do what big business wants. He is perfectly comfortable, perfectly
at home, doing the bidding of big bidness.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the legwork of other reporters from both the national and
Texas press as a springboard for their commentary, Ivins and Dubose
argue that as a candidate Bush benefited, at crucial points in his
career, from family influence and the largess of corporate
interests. They observe that most of the money for his failed oil
business ventures was raised during the years when his father ``was
either running for president or serving as Ronald Reagan's vice
president,'' and contend that he sold his stock in one of those
companies shortly ``before news of the company's precarious health
was made public.''
</P>
<P>
   He ``walked away from the whole mess,'' they coyly add, ``with
more money than Bill Clinton ever dreamed of making on a little
real-estate deal now known as Whitewater.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush's foray into baseball, which enabled him to turn a
$600,000 investment in the Texas Rangers into a $15 million profit,
Ivins and Dubose write that ``the team increased its book value
from $83 million to $138 million by convincing the city of
Arlington there would be no more baseball unless local taxpayers
sprang for a new stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, they observe, this anti-tax politician personally
benefited when residents of Arlington, worried about losing their
franchise to another city, voted ``to add a half-cent to one of the
highest sales taxes in the nation in order to raise the $191
million needed to build the Ballpark at Arlington.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the view of Ivins and Dubose that George W. Bush _ or
``Dubya,'' as they call him _ has successfully straddled ``the
divide between the Christian right and the economic conservatives
in the Republican Party'' by giving the members of the Christian
right ``just enough to keep them in line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks the talk but rarely walks the walk,'' they write, and
still gets the support of the Christian right because it wants to
be on the side of a winner. These observations, needless to say,
went to press before Bush's loss to John McCain in the New
Hampshire primary, a loss that has not only put Dubya's
front-runner status in question but has also heightened his tilt
toward his party's right wing.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Ivins and Dubose argue, Dubya's real concerns have
less to do with ``God, guns and gays'' than with the issues
``dearest to the business community,'' namely ``tort reform, lax
regulation of industrial polluters, tax cuts for the oil and gas
industry, electricity rates that place the interests of industry
far above the interests of consumers, and privatizing welfare for
huge profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking care of business, they argue, is Dubya's No. 1 priority,
a position that has had particularly serious consequences, they
contend, in the area of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   As governor of ``the state with the highest volume of air
pollution in the nation,'' Ivins and Dubose write, Bush
``accommodated the state's biggest polluters'' by implementing a
program of ``voluntary compliance.'' The companies that helped to
design that voluntary program, they add, showed their support for
Bush by contributing $260,648 to his 1998 gubernatorial campaign,
and $243,900 to his presidential campaign within a month of the
opening of his exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that even more financial support (as much as $4.5
million by one estimate) has come to Bush from business, medical
and real estate groups intent on promoting tort reform that would
help insulate ``corporate interests from lawsuits filed by
consumers, workers, injured parties and the survivors of those
killed through malice or negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   In depicting Bush as a friend of big business, who is ``blind to
the difficulties of life in the nation's underclass,'' Ivins and
Dubose rely upon a blend of sarcasm and down-home Texas invective
to make their points. Though this makes for a highly readable
narrative, it can also backfire on the authors when they overstate
their points.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing Bush's reported distaste for reading policy books,
for instance, it seems quite gratuitous to add that ``people who
have read only one book can be quite dangerous _ witness Timothy
McVeigh and all those poor citizens who read Ayn Rand and are stuck
like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus.''
</P>
<P>
   The one area in which Ivins and Dubose give Bush high points is
education, writing that ``he has been attentive, consistent, and a
hard worker to make public schools a higher priority for the
state.'' But they add that the weakness of the Texas governorship _
the office, they write, ranks ``behind lieutenant governor,
attorney general, comptroller and land commissioner'' in terms of
actual power _ means that ``it is impossible to give him the lion's
share of the credit for any single initiative _ too much of the
heavy lifting has been done by others.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, they argue, Bush's record as governor indicates
that ``he doesn't know much, doesn't do much, and doesn't care much
about governing.'' So much so, they conclude, that ``it's kind of
hard to figure out why he wants a job where he's expected to
govern.'' &QL;

   LEBANON-U.S. (Beirut, Lebanon) _ A week after Israeli aircraft
destroyed three Lebanese power plants in retaliation for guerrilla
attacks that killed Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, popular
anger erupted Thursday outside the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. Hundreds
of Lebanese students joined with other protesters in throwing rocks
and tomatoes at Lebanese army and police detachments, which
responded with batons, tear gas canisters and high-pressure water
hoses. The protests appeared to have been organized with the help
of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Party of God, whose guerrillas
have mounted an offensive in the south that has killed seven
Israeli soldiers in less than three weeks. By John F. Burns.

mice that have been artificially given cirrhosis. If it works in

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
said Thursday that the powerhouse economy shows few signs of
slowing despite four interest rate increases over the past eight
months, and he warned that the central bank will probably raise
rates further to avert a buildup of inflation pressures.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to the House Banking Committee, Greenspan said the
current combination of strong growth, low inflation, declining
unemployment and improving efficiency among businesses and workers
was unprecedented in the half century he has spent monitoring the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But he stressed that the good times could fall victim to
gradually mounting inflation pressures if the Fed did not act to
take some steam out of the expansion, which this month became the
longest on record at eight years and 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed next meets to consider monetary policy on March 21, and
economists said the tone of Greenspan's testimony Thursday all but
ensured that the central bank would act then to raise its benchmark
federal funds target rate by another quarter of a point, to 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also used his appearance to reiterate his position
that the federal budget surplus should be used to reduce the
national debt rather than for tax cuts or new spending. He said the
recent turmoil in the bond market caused by the gradual reduction
in the quantity of Treasury debt was having no effect on the Fed's
ability to slow the economy through increases in the short-term
rates it controls. And he said he was somewhat worried by the
recent sharp rise in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   But his focus was on the risk that the economy was simply too
strong for its own good.
</P>
<P>
   The strains on the economy might soon become evident in the
labor market, he said, where a rapidly declining pool of jobless
workers could force employers to begin raising wages at a pace that
could ignite a widespread and destabilizing rise in prices.
</P>
<P>
   But he traced the underlying problem to the stock market.
Buoyant stock prices, he said, were fueling consumer spending and
business investment to such a degree that overall demand in the
economy was outstripping supply.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to resolve that fundamental imbalance, he said, was
to sharply curtail the relentless rise in equity prices.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in blue chip stock seemed to heed his warning, sending
the Dow Jones industrial average down during the day. But as they
have repeatedly over the past few years, investors in technology
stocks thumbed their noses at Greenspan by driving the Nasdaq index
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little evidence that the American economy, which grew
more than 4 percent in 1999 and surged forward at an even faster
pace in the second half of the year, is slowing appreciably,''
Greenspan said at the beginning of his twice-a-year testimony to
Congress on the economy and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the very factors underpinning the nation's
remarkable economic performance _ falling joblessness, accelerating
productivity, an improved outlook for corporate earnings _ ``are
also engendering a set of imbalances that, unless contained,
threaten our continuing prosperity,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures on the economy have been eased so far by a surge
in imports, which have made up for the inability of domestic
producers to keep up with demand, and by the willingness of people
who had not previously been in the labor force to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   But those ``safety valves,'' he said, could not contain
inflationary pressures forever, especially since the rate increases
so far have done little to rein in growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's policy-setting federal Open Market Committee ``will
have to stay alert for signs that real interest rates have not yet
risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line with that of
potential supply, even should the acceleration of productivity
continue,'' Greenspan said. ``Achieving that alignment seems more
pressing today than it did earlier, before the effects of
imbalances began to cumulate, lessening the depths of our various
buffers against inflationary pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of rebalancing the economy, he said, would be limiting or
ending the rise in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not necessarily imply a decline in asset values _
although that, of course, can happen at any time for a number of
reasons _ but rather that these values will rise no faster than
household incomes,'' Greenspan said.

<P>
   A-TWANI, West Bank _ Life in a cave was good for Ibrahim Abu
Jundiyeh, but his family lost even that meager existence in the
fight for the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy. We were joyous in the cave. We had our land,''
Abu Jundiyeh said. They had rugs on the dirt floor, an entrance of
stone blocks and a few hundred square yards for his wife, 11
children and their livestock to spread out.
</P>
<P>
   But they were among about 450 people, according to the Israeli
human rights group B'Tselem, that the Israeli army has evicted from
caves in the rocky Hebron hills since October.
</P>
<P>
   The families say they had been in the caves for generations.
Now, many have gone to tents and borrowed homes in the villages
nearby, some of the poorest in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   They complain that many of their goats and sheep, which shared
their large caves at night, have died from cold. The children have
coughs too, after months of winter rain and two snowstorms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather die than live like this,'' said Abu Jundiyeh,
50.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Army officials said Abu Jundiyeh and the others had to
be moved because they were in a military zone set aside for
light-weapons target practice. Palestinians say they never hear
weapons firing and claim such military zones are just excuses for
land confiscation.
</P>
<P>
   The cave dwellers appear to be caught amid the jostling of the
Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Under Oslo, Israel is withdrawing from land in the West Bank
captured in 1967. But there are about 150 Jewish settlements,
really housing developments, spread throughout the area.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements are part of the battle for ``facts on the
ground'' in the West Bank. The idea is that final rulings about who
gets land will be determined by who is living there at the time.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say the settlements create obstacles to a peace
agreement. Under pressure to stop their growth, the Israeli
government last fall evicted militant settlers from about a dozen
new outposts they had established.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Jundiyeh's eviction _ and subsequent arrest for eight days
when he refused to move _ came Nov. 16, just a few days after
Jewish settlers were evicted from the Ma'on Farm settlement nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The army told the settlers they could not stay in a firing
range, and the leaders of the 170,000-strong settler movement
pointed to the several hundred cave dwellers, demanding they be
cleared out too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a war going on for my country,'' said Yehudit Tayar,
spokeswoman for the settlers leadership council. ``The decisions
that are going to be made are going to be very dependent on where
everybody is.''
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Dror, spokesman for the Israel's military administration
of the West Bank, said that other cave dwellers in firing ranges
have been evicted over the last several years. They are regularly
allowed back to tend their fields.
</P>
<P>
   He says the cave families have other homes and are only in the
tents because Palestinian leaders want to use them as facts on the
ground against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But, some of the army's harshest critics come from Israel
itself. Israeli peace groups, for example, have helped Palestinian
groups provide tents and medical care to the cave dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, seven Israeli writers signed a public plea for
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to let the cave dwellers go home.
The list included literary notables as Amos Oz and A.B. Yehoshua.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel ashamed about what we are doing, for what our army
is doing,'' said author David Grossman, who signed the letter. ``I
have seen a lot of injustice in the last 15 years, but it is very
rare that you see such an injustice so clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said that even if the cave dwellers have other homes _
and many deny that they do _ cave life has been their chosen way
for generations.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Mahmoud Hussein Hamamdeh, lost two caves where his
family and livestock lived. Now, he is borrowing a dirt-floor,
stone house here in A-Twani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will wait to return to my land,'' he said, ``Or, I will die
here.''

`PITCH BLACK': DARK AND DISMAL DOINGS ON A PLANET WITH THREE SUNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end)

<P>
   With his elephantine glare and trapezius muscles that could
support a Mack truck, Vin Diesel, who appears in two films opening
Friday, is definitely the flavor of the movie weekend. In ``The
Boiler Room'' he is a hulking illegal stock trader who would be
right at home in the world of ``The Sopranos.'' And in the snazzily
atmospheric sci-fi horror film ``Pitch Black'' he is Riddick, a
fiendishly grinning murderer with a nose for menstrual blood. In
the movie's opening scenes, in which Riddick tears off his
manacles, he suggests a bone-crushing hybrid of Hannibal Lecter,
Harry Houdini and Hulk Hogan stomping out of a leather fetishist's
private dungeon.
</P>
<P>
   But in both roles Diesel finds ways to insinuate glints of
humor, intelligence and even a grudging sweetness. As styles of
macho, shaved-headed antihero go, he is a new variation on
something familiar. Think of Telly Savalas as a hip-hop thug, and
you'll get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, of course, no one's trapezius muscles could
actually handle a Mack truck. But the combination of Diesel's
massive shoulders and good-natured sarcasm go a long way toward
carrying ``Pitch Black'' above the muscle-bound fray. Narratively
speaking, the movie isn't much more than a flickering montage of
scary action sequences set in the nightmarish murk of a remote
planet after the crash landing of a spacecraft that kills most of
the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But in evoking a fear of darkness and of shrieking batlike
things slicing at you when the lights go out, the movie shrewdly
taps into the lurking primal terrors of anyone who ever had to
sleep with a night light. If ``Pitch Black'' goes where ``The Blair
Witch Project'' has gone before, it has millions of dollars at its
disposal to give that unnamable menace a shape as well as a sound.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the list of survivors besides Riddick, who is being
transported from one prison to another, are his sullenly handsome
guard, Johns (Cole Hauser), and the spacecraft's attractive docking
pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), who become the quarreling de facto
leaders of an escape plan. The remaining survivors, a loose rainbow
coalition, range from a Muslim cleric to a fussy English
antiquities dealer whose stash of fine wine comes in handy as
lighting fuel when a solar eclipse (the planet has three suns)
plunges the wasteland into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black,'' directed by David Twohy, from a screenplay he
wrote with Jim and Ken Wheat, tweaks this formulaic
escape-from-hell story with just enough original touches to give it
a lift. Hauser's Johns may look heroic, but he turns out to be no
Luke Skywalker when he is discovered injecting morphine into his
eyeball. And while Mitchell's Fry fits the image of a Little Fixit
Superwoman who will lead everyone to safety, she turns out to be a
bit of a bungler.
</P>
<P>
   One of the movie's most ingenious touches is to make the
carnivorous monsters, who come out only at night, all things to all
fantasies. When first encountered, they are wriggling subterranean
octopuses that shoot shiny tubular tentacles out of holes in the
desert and pull their prey underground. Once the planet's sulfurous
yellow daylight ends, they swarm above the desolate desert-scape in
chattering armies. When deprived of human prey, they begin to
attack and devour one another while in the air, raining down bluish
blood and entrails on those below. But the clearest glimpses of
them come through Riddick's surgically improved, radarlike night
vision, in which they resemble shark-toothed flying starfish. The
movie also shows the humans through the creatures' eyes as shadowy
line drawings.
</P>
<P>
   One thing ``Pitch Black'' can't do is begin to create the
engulfing sense of total darkness that its title promises. Even
when the survivors' lights begin to fail (among the unforeseen
meteorological events on this supposedly parched planet is an
unexpected cloudburst), the humans are clearly visible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as their lights begin to flicker, and the ravenous
creatures gather on the edge of darkness, you have an ominous sense
of what the world must have been like before electric light gave us
the illusion of rationality, a time when our demons couldn't be
instantly banished with the flick of a switch.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Pitch Black'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and some
gory violence.

 &HT;    PALESTINIAN CAVEDWELLERS OUSTED IN MIDEAST BATTLE FOR 'FACTS ON
THE GROUND'

<TEXT>
<P>
   A-TWANI, West Bank _ Life in a cave was good for Ibrahim Abu
Jundiyeh, but his family lost even that meager existence in the
fight for the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy. We were joyous in the cave. We had our land,''
Abu Jundiyeh said. They had rugs on the dirt floor, an entrance of
stone blocks and a few hundred square yards for his wife, 11
children and their livestock to spread out.
</P>
<P>
   But they were among about 450 people, according to the Israeli
human rights group B'Tselem, that the Israeli army has evicted from
caves in the rocky Hebron hills since October.
</P>
<P>
   The families say they had been in the caves for generations.
Now, many have gone to tents and borrowed homes in the villages
nearby, some of the poorest in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   They complain that many of their goats and sheep, which shared
their large caves at night, have died from cold. The children have
coughs too, after months of winter rain and a snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather die than live like this,'' said Abu Jundiyeh,
50.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Army officials said Abu Jundiyeh and the others had to
be moved because they were in a military zone set aside for
light-weapons target practice. Palestinians say they never hear
weapons firing and claim such military zones are just excuses for
land confiscation.
</P>
<P>
   The cave dwellers appear to be caught amid the jostling of the
Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Under Oslo, Israel is withdrawing from land in the West Bank
captured in 1967. But there are about 150 Jewish settlements,
really housing developments, spread throughout the area.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements are part of the battle for ``facts on the
ground'' in the West Bank. The idea is that final rulings about who
gets land will be determined by who is living there at the time.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say the settlements create obstacles to a peace
agreement. Under pressure to stop their growth, the Israeli
government last fall evicted militant settlers from about a dozen
new outposts they had established.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Jundiyeh's eviction _ and subsequent arrest for eight days
when he refused to move _ came Nov. 16, just a few days after
Jewish settlers were evicted from the Ma'on Farm settlement nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The army told the settlers they could not stay in a firing
range, and the leaders of the 170,000-strong settler movement
pointed to the several hundred cave dwellers, demanding they be
cleared out too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a war going on for my country,'' said Yehudit Tayar,
spokeswoman for the settlers leadership council. ``The decisions
that are going to be made are going to be very dependent on where
everybody is.''
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Dror, spokesman for the Israel's military administration
of the West Bank, said that other cave dwellers in firing ranges
have been evicted over the last several years. They are regularly
allowed back to tend their fields.
</P>
<P>
   He says the cave families have other homes and are only in the
tents because Palestinian leaders want to use them as facts on the
ground against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But, some of the army's harshest critics come from Israel
itself. Israeli peace groups, for example, have helped Palestinian
groups provide tents and medical care to the cave dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, seven Israeli writers signed a public plea for
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to let the cave dwellers go home.
The list included literary notables as Amos Oz and A.B. Yehoshua.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel ashamed about what we are doing, for what our army
is doing,'' said author David Grossman, who signed the letter. ``I
have seen a lot of injustice in the last 15 years, but it is very
rare that you see such an injustice so clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said that even if the cave dwellers have other homes _
and many deny that they do _ cave life has been their chosen way
for generations.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Mahmoud Hussein Hamamdeh, lost two caves where his
family and livestock lived. Now, he is borrowing a dirt-floor,
stone house here in A-Twani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will wait to return to my land,'' he said, ``Or, I will die
here.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Confederate flags for everybody
 &HT;    (Fixes grammar and clarity in 3rd and 7th grafs.)
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ People ask what I think about the Confederate
flag flap. I tell them not much.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the truth. I don't spend much time thinking about the
Confederate flag, or what it represents then and now. It neither
inspires nor inflames me. I could say the same about the Lone Star
flag.
</P>
<P>
   The American flag, however, is something else again. I can
become teary-eyed when we're singing ``The Star-Spangled Banner''
as I watch Old Glory waving in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   The more I travel in other parts of the world, the more America
means to me, and the flag for which it stands, indivisible.
</P>
<P>
   What the Confederate flag stands for is what's currently
dividing this nation's people _ meaning as it does, for some, the
heritage of the Old South; for others, the racism of neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Same flag, same flagpole, diverse reactions _ and you ain't just
whistling ``Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   Which sort of brings me to my point. As you may or may not know,
the song of the Old South, ``Dixie,'' was appropriated by Union
forces during the Civil War, such were its stirring strains.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, even today, you'll find these alternative lyrics in
the archives of patriotic songs, the way the North sang it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Way down South in the land of traitors,
</P>
<P>
   ``Rattlesnakes and alligators,
</P>
<P>
   ``Come away, come away, stay away, Dixieland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where cotton's king and men are chattel,
</P>
<P>
   ``Yankee boys must win the battle,
</P>
<P>
   ``Come away, come away, stay away, Dixieland.''
</P>
<P>
   If I had been a Union soldier in the time of the Civil War,
that's the version I would have sung.
</P>
<P>
   And if I were an African-American in these times, I think I
would appropriate the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   Certain modifications, of course, would be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Picture the battle flag of the Confederacy _ blue bars of white
stars crossed on a blood-red field _ which speaks volumes of the
heritage of the Old South.
</P>
<P>
   Now picture the battle flag of the Confederacy _ the same blue
bars, the same white stars, the same blood-red field, but
surrounded by a huge black circle with a slash through it. That
would speak volumes as well.
</P>
<P>
   If I were an African-American, I'd probably fly that flag over
the headquarters of the NAACP, on the grilles of 18-wheelers driven
by black truckers, on the walls of black-owned restaurants and
other private businesses _ all the places where you see the
traditional Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   And even on a separate but equally prominent flagstaff over the
Capitol building of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Would it outrage white Southerners who revere the flag of the
Old South?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. That's the whole idea.
</P>
<P>
   Because if nothing else, it would accomplish this much:
</P>
<P>
   Those white Southerners, who say they can't understand the rage
of African-Americans when the Confederate flag is displayed in
public places, would now know exactly how it feels.
</P>

`THE WHOLE NINE YARDS': A SCHLUMPY DENTIST AND HIS WISE-GUY
NEIGHBOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Whole Nine Yards,'' Matthew Perry can be seen in the
kind of role Bruce Willis used to get in the beginning of his film
career (in movies like ``Blind Date''): the likable loser who just
wants to do what's right. And Willis has graduated, if that's the
word, to playing the kind of grinning tough guy he used to mock on
the old ``Moonlighting'' television series.
</P>
<P>
   Perry is Oz, a nice-guy dentist so beaten down by his bored,
pouty harridan of a wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), and his
mother-in-law, who ridicules him mercilessly, that he's given to
fits of anger. After he pulls out of his driveway, Oz just starts
pounding the interior of his car with his fists, or his forehead.
Collecting himself, he drives off and a few yards later begins
flailing away at the steering wheel again.
</P>
<P>
   When the confident Jimmy ( Willis) breezes into the house next
door, decked out in ensembles from the Danny Aiello collection _
open two-toned sport shirts exposing fresh white undershirts _ Oz's
anxieties are ratcheted up several points on the Richter scale. It
turns out Jimmy is Jimmy (the Tulip) Tudeski, a former Chicago
organized crime figure who ratted out his associates. Sophie
coerces Oz into giving Jimmy's location away to Jimmy's old mob
boss, the peculiarly accented Janni (Kevin Pollak).
</P>
<P>
   Oz is scrambling to dig himself out of a financial crater his
father-in-law left behind; he sighs, ``I'm worth more dead than
alive.'' Sophie, playing both sides, wants a hit on him. And Jimmy,
with his bark of a laugh, sets Oz's knees to knocking whenever he
turns up.
</P>
<P>
   It's an intricate sprawl of a plot, ``The Whole Nine Yards,''
with hit men, love interests (Jimmy's ex-wife, played by Natasha
Henstridge, is part of the story, too), large sums of money and
allegiances constantly in motion. The mountainous Michael Clarke
Duncan plays a hit man so big he's like a ZIP code with a pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who resembles a puppy that benefits from rather chic hair
care products, shows the knack for slapstick that he employs on the
sitcom ``Friends,'' flinging himself about as if trying to take a
bullet for his president. His real talent is verbal finesse, which
he doesn't get to exploit; some of his line readings on ``Friends''
are so precise that it takes a moment for them to register. (He can
do almost as much with a nervous pause or stammer as Woody Allen.)
Wrapping a tanned arm around Perry as he prepares to take him for a
drive, Willis coos, ``It won't kill you.'' Perry mutters,
``Promise?''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is another Jonathan Lynn identity-crisis comedy; he
directed ``My Cousin Vinny'' and ``Trial and Error,'' with Michael
Richards, which may have been the biggest misuse of the wide screen
in the history of big lenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yards'' is minus the verve of someone who can take a simple
idea to the extreme; it must have been directed by a sleepwalker.
Despite Perry's plucky slapstick and the treacherous gunplay that
accounts for the second half of the movie, ``Yards'' is
underwhelming, amusing only in fits and starts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few things in the film's favor is that it's actually
set in Montreal instead of pretending to take place in an American
city. (For once, the Canadians don't try to hide their fluted
vowels.)
</P>
<P>
   The real star of ``Yards'' is Amanda Peet, playing Jill, Oz's
receptionist, a young woman with a keen affinity for the mechanics
of murder. Her smile has the warm wattage of Julia Roberts, with a
grin so prominent and appealing that you almost expect a joke to be
played off of it, since this is a movie about a dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Jill has the same sunny, eager interest in her boss as in
Jimmy's career as a hit man; she doesn't make distinctions about
anything she likes. She comes to represent an ideal _ loyalty _ but
does so with such blithe commitment that she's like grapefruit
sorbet: she cleanses the palate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The Whole Nine Yards' is rated R (under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nudity,
violence and language particular to gangsters. &QL;

DETAILS COUNT   IN   RENOVATION OF THE WHITE HOUSE BLUE ROOM

<TEXT>
<P>
   This year is the 200th anniversary of Abigail and John Adams'
move into the White House. As its first residents, they had very
little furniture, and Adams complained about the spartan
surroundings. The current White House curator, Betty C. Monkman,
said that at the top of her wish list for future acquisitions would
be ``something _ anything _ associated with the Adams family, be it
silver, furniture or a portrait of Mrs. Adams.''
</P>
<P>
   Monkman knows what she needs. She has just completed a book on
the historic furnishings of the White House, which Abbeville Press
and the White House Historical Association will publish in
September.
</P>
<P>
   It is the antiques in the White House that determine its
decoration. Take the Blue Room, which was recently renovated at a
cost of $358,358. (The money was raised by the White House
Endowment Fund, a nonprofit charity and subsidiary of the
historical association.) The entire project was driven by the
design of a suite of French furniture that President James Monroe
ordered in 1817.
</P>
<P>
   History buffs will recall that the White House was designed in
1792 by James Hoban, an Irish architect turned Southerner who won a
design contest advertised in newspapers. (The ad was written by
Thomas Jefferson, then secretary of state, who also entered the
contest but lost.) The oval Blue Room was placed on the State
Floor, where public receptions are held.
</P>
<P>
   The British sacked and burned the White House in 1814, but it
was rebuilt in 1817. James Monroe, a Virginian, and his New
York-born wife, Elizabeth, were the first residents of the rebuilt
mansion. As American minister to France, Monroe had lived in Paris
for years. As president he ordered 2 sofas, 2 screens, 6 footstools
and 38 chairs from Pierre-Antoine Bellange (1758-1827), a master
Paris cabinetmaker patronized by Napoleon, Louis XVIII and Charles
X.
</P>
<P>
   He also ordered a marble-top table and a pier table, the only
two pieces of furniture that have remained in the White House
continuously since 1817, according to Betty Boyd Caroli, author of
``Inside the White House.'' He specified mahogany, but Bellange
delivered gilded beechwood, decorated with carved sprigs of olives,
telling Monroe that mahogany was not appropriate for a presidential
palace. Cynics think the French were unable to obtain mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   When the Monroes left the White House, they took some of the
Bellange suite with them. Presidents were allowed to remove
furnishings until 1961, when Congress made all objects belonging to
the White House ``inalienable'' parts of its permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   President James Buchanan sold the rest of the Bellange chairs at
auction in 1860, when Empire furniture went out of style, and
replaced them with a Victorian Rococo Revival suite.
</P>
<P>
   Kaki Hockersmith, the Little Rock, Ark., decorator commissioned
by Hillary Rodham Clinton to help redo the White House in 1992,
said three of the original Bellange chairs were acquired in 1961
and 1962. One of the original bergeres and three more chairs were
bought in 1972, during the presidency of Richard M. Nixon. (Nixon
sponsored the largest program of antiques acquisition for the White
House, guided by Clement E. Conger, the curator who assembled the
fine collection of American antiques that grace the diplomatic
reception rooms at the State Department.)
</P>
<P>
   With several of the Bellange pieces in hand, Hockersmith went
about redoing the Blue Room, which had last been refurbished in
1972 and was quite shabby from the onslaught of 1.5 million
sightseers a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were considerations of style, color, paint finishes,
wallpaper and carpets,'' said Hockersmith, who was required to
consult regularly with the Committee for the Preservation of the
White House. The first lady is chairwoman of the committee, which
also includes the director of the National Trust for Historic
Preservation; Jonathan Fairbanks, a former curator of decorative
arts at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston; curators from the
Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library in Delaware; and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge was to decorate around the French furniture,''
said Monkman, who is also on the committee. ``We wanted a sense of
how French decor would have been done in a ceremonial house in
1817.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Thomas Savage Jr., a committee member who runs Sotheby's
educational programs, added: ``We tried to create a room that would
speak eloquently to the Bellange furniture. We wanted the room to
be evocative of the high-style taste of the Monroe era.''
</P>
<P>
   The first consideration was color, as the room had been many
shades over the years, including robin's-egg blue. ``Mrs. Clinton
wanted a more vibrant blue,'' said Hockersmith, who is also
decorating the Clintons' new home in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked a blue that was known on the Continent at that
time,'' Savage said. ``But we also had to consider how the color
would look on camera, which is very tricky. Receptions in the Blue
Room are often televised, so we had to make some concessions for
modern living.''
</P>
<P>
   After long deliberations Hockersmith ordered $112,000 worth of
sapphire-blue silk with gold medallions for the Bellange chairs and
blue and gold silk for the draperies from Scalamandre.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the wallpaper. Wendy Cooper, a curator at Winterthur,
and Richard Nylander, director of the Society for the Preservation
of New England Antiquities, joined Hockersmith for a day at the
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in Manhattan, looking at
period wallpapers and documents. For the side walls they chose a
document from an 1820 New England house belonging to the society
and a swag border and dado from original French wallpapers of 1815.
</P>

   ``Mrs. Clinton said the swag border didn't look quite right,''
Hockersmith recalled. ``So we took away part of the brown shadow,
and it suddenly looked like real fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   The wallpaper had been done originally as a block print.
Brunschwig et Fils had to transfer it to silk-screen, a process
that took weeks. Hockersmith ordered $24,215 worth of the
wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   The blue rug with the center medallion is a copy of a period
carpet from England that was French-inspired. ``It's an 1820s
design,'' Nylander said. ``We chose it to coordinate with the
furniture.'' Hackersmith ordered a copy from Stark Carpet, at an
estimated cost of $48,500.
</P>
<P>
   So it went. Decision after decision. It took years to complete
the Blue Room. ``It looks spectacular now,'' said Stuart Feld,
president of Hirschl &AMP; Adler, who sold the White House two pairs of
French sinumbra lamps from the 1820s and is a frequent visitor.
``I've known a succession of curators there,'' he said. ``They are
less likely to spring for an antique unless it has a direct
connection to the White House. But they are always interested in
anything that was there once.''

`NOT ONE LESS': A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER IS PUT TO THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By A.O SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zhang Yimou's ``Not One Less'' enlarges the possibilities of
filmmaking even as it grounds itself in one of cinema's oldest,
most basic principles: the camera's ability to document reality.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang is best known for heart-wrenching, visually stunning
period dramas like ``Raise the Red Lantern'' and ``Shanghai
Triad,'' and for his association with Gong Li, one of the
outstanding film actresses of our time.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Not One Less,'' he has chosen to work with a cast of
ordinary villagers and city dwellers _ schoolchildren, shopkeepers
and minor functionaries _ most of whom play themselves. And he has
restrained his painterly temperament _ the sense of color and
composition he used to magnificent effect in movies like ``Ju Dou''
and ``Red Sorghum'' _ preferring simply to observe the ragged
textures and jerky rhythms of daily life in a poor, dusty corner of
modern China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not One Less'' is, among other things, about scarcity. In one
early scene, an elderly teacher painstakingly counts out 26 pieces
of chalk, one for each day of the month he will be absent. When the
chalk is broken and trampled because of the carelessness of his
temporary replacement, you feel an almost sickening sense of waste.
And later you feel something like awe at the sight of 27 children
sharing their reward for a hot day's Sisyphean labor in a
brickyard: two lukewarm cans of Coca-Cola, which is all they can
afford.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its deliberate austerity, ``Not One Less'' is
extraordinarily rich. And despite the look and pace of raw
documentary film, the movie is a splendid, assured piece of
storytelling. Its narrative emerges slowly and organically from a
mass of observed detail so that it feels like a series of events
the camera has discovered out in the world, rather than like the
realization of a scheme the filmmaker has devised beforehand in his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of ``Not One Less'' is Wei (Wei Minzhi), 13, a
primary school graduate who has been pressed into service as a
substitute teacher in the Shuiquan Primary School. She stands a few
inches taller than her charges, and it is hard not to hear more
than a trace of irony in their voices when they address her,
according to the dictates of courtesy and custom, as ``Teacher
Wei.''
</P>
<P>
   Her main qualifications, other than the fact that no one else
wants the job, are an innate, unsmiling bossiness, neat handwriting
and her ability to perform, in a tentative, quavering voice, one
song about Chairman Mao.
</P>
<P>
   The film's first half is like a cinema-verite debunking of every
uplifting heroic-teacher melodrama from ``The Corn Is Green'' to
``Dangerous Minds.'' Teacher Wei writes lessons on the blackboard,
her students copy them into notebooks and everybody seems pretty
miserable. Pedagogical rapport is out of the question: either Wei
succeeds in browbeating her pupils or they succeed in humiliating
her. (The impulse to abuse substitute teachers seems to transcend
cultures.)
</P>
<P>
   Especially successful is Zhang Huike, who drives Wei to
paroxysms of frustration. (The class clown is also, apparently, a
universal archetype, unless young Zhang Huike has access to pirated
satellite broadcasts of ``The Simpsons.'')
</P>
<P>
   But then Zhang Huike is sent to the city to work off his
parents' debts. Wei, who has been promised a bonus if she can keep
her class intact (this is the source of the film's title), sets out
to bring him home. And the movie, which has so far been a slow,
touching study of village life, becomes something else: a work of
lyrical realism that has some of the shattering, redemptive power
of Vittorio De Sica's ``Bicycle Thief.''
</P>
<P>
   Wei Minzhi's performance, if that is the word for it, slowly
takes on a heroic cast. Her character is composed of equal parts
pigheadedness and cluelessness, which is to say that she's 13 in a
way that anyone who knows a real 13-year-old, or has been one, will
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Her sense of how the world works is based on instinct, wishful
thinking and second-hand information, and is almost entirely at
odds with the way the world works.
</P>
<P>
   The long second half of the film, in which Wei fruitlessly hunts
for Zhang Huike on the bewildering streets of the provincial
metropolis of Jiangjiakou City, is almost unbearable. Why doesn't
she just give up and go home? Only an infernally stubborn,
hopelessly ignorant child would persevere in the face of a world so
huge, so unyielding and so casual in its cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Wei might be the younger sister of the title character in ``The
Story of Qiu Ju,'' Zhang's 1992 film, which starred an almost
unrecognizable Gong Li as a pregnant farmer's wife pursuing an
apparently hopeless cause through China's implacable legal
bureaucracy. Like Qiu Ju, Teacher Wei will not take no for an
answer, and the force of her will transports this movie beyond
naturalism into the realm of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not One Less'' earns its emotional payoff the hard way. It may
be the greatest film ever made about obstinacy, which it reveals to
be not only a virtue, but also a species of grace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This film is not rated. &QL;

   DOW _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan removed any doubt
on Thursday that interest rates on business and consumer loans _
the kind that sustain economic growth _ are headed higher. In his
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, Greenspan said the U.S. economy is
still growing too fast even after four short-tern rate hikes since
last June. He added that the Fed will stick to a policy of
``incremental interest-rate increases'' this year to avert
inflation _ even though he added that, at the moment, ``inflation
has remained largely contained.'' The prospect of higher interest
rates sent financial and other interest-sensitive stocks lower,
dragging down the Dow Jones industrial average. But technology
stocks advanced on profit gains. (Walker, Atlanta

competitive industry that was the promise of airline
deregulation.'' The airlines say the site would be independently

<P>
   FILM-MEG-RYAN-INTERVIEW _ She's Megnetic _ at least that's kind
how Meg Ryan is described by her ``Hanging Up'' co-star Lisa
Kudrow. While Ryan is still making movies, it's motherhood and
coffee-drinking, in that order, that take priority most days. By
Glenn Whipp (moved on the ``e'' entertainment wire).
</P>
<P>
   FILM-PEET-FEATURE _ Amanda Peet is the bright (and occasionally
naked) spot in ``The Whole Nine Yards.'' She's also got a day job
as the Jack in ``Jack and Jill'' on the WB. By Bob Strauss (moved
on the ``e'' entertainment wire).
</P>
<P>
   TV-PICKS _ Daily News TV critic David Kronke picks the ``Law &AMP;
Order''-meets-``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit'' crossover and
an ``X-Files''-meets-``Cops'' blend as two shows to look out for
this weekend (moved on the ``e'' entertainment wire).
</P>
<P>
   FILM-PITCH-BLACK-REVIEW - Down-on-their-luck space humans
crash-land on a desert planet populated by strange, dangerous
things. You've seen it before. ``Pitch Black'' doesn't do it
particularly worse or better than the median ``Alien''-attrition
norm. By Bob Strauss (moved on the ``e'' entertainment wire)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-BOILER-ROOM-REVIEW - ``Boiler Room,'' a high-energy look at
a group of Generation-X stock swindlers, is a modestly entertaining
film that's mostly derivative of other, better movies like ``Wall
Street'' and ``Glengarry Glen Ross.'' But at least first-time
writer-director Ben Younger is smart enough to acknowledge those
sources, while simultaneously bidding to become part of the greed
canon. By Glenn Whipp (moved on the ``e'' entertainment wire).
</P>
<P>
   FILM-NINE-YARDS-REVIEW - ``The Whole Nine Yards'' isn't as funny
as ``Analyze This,'' but after a slow start it develops into its
own kind of farcical good time. And its extreme nature actually
adds to the laughs _ what you're expected to buy into here is often
so dark, the only honest response to it is in gasping chuckles. By
Bob Strauss (moved on the ``e'' entertainment wire).
</P>
<P>
   FILM-NOT-ONE-LESS-REVIEW _ A sweet and winning tale of an
innocent girl's fierce determination, ``Not One Less'' finds
Chinese director Zhang Yimou embracing the very same themes he did
eight years ago in ``The Story of Qiu Ju.'' Only here, Yimou has
cast the film entirely with non-professionals, with all
participants roughly playing the same roles they have in life. By
Glenn Whipp (moved on the ``e'' entertainment wire).
</P>
<P>
   FILM-HANGING-UP-REVIEW _ The unsurprising news that families can
drive you nuts is unnecessarily emphasized by the shrill clan
depicted in ``Hanging Up.'' By Bob Strauss (moved on the ``e''
entertainment wire).
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-ASLEEP-AT-THE-WHEEL _ Already the recipient of six Grammy
Awards, Asleep at the Wheel could be forgiven for being at bit
jaded about the chance to double that number with its half-dozen
nominations for Wednesday's awards ceremony. By Fred Shuster (moved
on the ``e'' entertainment wire).
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-DISCS-REVIEWS _ CD reviews by Daily News staff (moved on
the ``e'' entertainment wire).
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-COLUMN _ ``Double Jeopardy,'' with Ashley Judd and Tommy
Lee Jones,'' and a re-release of the Truffaut's ``Jules and Jim''
are two highlights of this week's upcoming VHS and DVD releases. By
Rob Lowman (moved on the ``e'' entertainment wire).
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-SONGS _ Hap Palmer takes traditional kids' favorites like
``Old McDonald,'' ``Itsy Bitsy Spider'' and ``Bingo,'' and updates
them with new verses to help young ones learn their numbers,
letters and colors. By Nancy Hewitt (moved on the ``e''
entertainment wire).
</P>
<P>
   TV-SUNDAY-REVIEWS _ Sweeps brings us ``Little Richard,''
starring Leon as the flamboyant rocker, ``The Wishing Tree,'' with
Blair Underwood as a magical, mute forest-dweller, and ``Flowers
for Algernon,'' with Matthew Modine updating the role that earned
Cliff Robertson an Oscar in 1968's ``Charly.'' By David Kronke.
EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, FEB. 20. (moved on the ``e'' entertainment
wire).
</P>
<P>
   GAME-ZOBMONDO _ You don't really have to swallow worms or eat
boogers anymore now that you're grown. But you can still take these
and other such dares (in spirit, anyway) with a new board game,
Zobmondo, created by a former business student at UCLA. By Phil
Davis (moved on the ``e'' entertainment wire).

   DOW _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan removed any doubt
on Thursday that interest rates on business and consumer loans _
the kind that sustain economic growth _ are headed higher. In his
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, Greenspan said the U.S. economy is
still growing too fast even after four short-tern rate hikes since
last June. He added that the Fed will stick to a policy of
``incremental interest-rate increases'' this year to avert
inflation _ even though he added that, at the moment, ``inflation
has remained largely contained.'' The prospect of higher interest
rates sent financial and other interest-sensitive stocks lower,
dragging down the Dow Jones industrial average. But technology
stocks advanced on profit gains. (Walker, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

   ASTA-TRAVEL _The nation's largest travel agent group wants the

competitive industry that was the promise of airline
deregulation.'' The airlines say the site would be independently
managed to ensure neutrality. (Thurston, Atlanta

<P>
   AND BARDOT CREATED SIZZLE
</P>
<P>
   It has become a flood: Brigitte Bardot videos. By the end of
April there will be 10 Bardot films in recent release, an absolute
outpouring for a figure who, though she more than made a mark for
herself in the 1950s as the liberating ``sex kitten'' of French
film, hardly has the retrospective potential of, say, Humphrey
Bogart (the subject of an 18-film video reissue next month).
</P>
<P>
   Movies by the bunch are often linked to commemorative occasions,
and in this case the death last week of Roger Vadim, the French
director who helped make Bardot famous, might have served the
purpose. But the Bardot video wave had already begun in October
with ``Une Parisienne'' (1957), a bedroom farce with Charles Boyer,
and ``Plucking the Daisy'' (1956), with Bardot as a frisky romance
novelist who is shipped off to a convent, both released by Home
Vision.
</P>
<P>
   In November came ``The Night Heaven Fell'' (1958), directed by
Vadim, in which Bardot makes a long sexual getaway with a
good-for-nothing (Stephen Boyd) who has murdered her uncle and
seduced her aunt.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Home Vision will release Vadim's ``Don Juan''
(1973), with Bardot as a MademoiselleDon Juan, and his film ``And
God Created Woman'' (1956), in which Bardot's wild dancing and
frank sexuality electrified French film and helped make it
something of a sensation in the United States. In that film, in
garb ranging from scanty to nothing, the young Juliette (``pouty''
and ``saucy'' being two favorite adjectives applied to Bardot
characters) keeps a rich old womanizer (Curt Jurgens) dangling
while having an affair with the brother (Christian Marquand) of her
brooding, long-suffering husband (Jean-Louis Trintignant). ``And
the devil created Bardot,'' someone wrote in the French press.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly, although Bardot never made apologies for cutting a wide
sexual swath. In April, Anchor Bay will release a documentary,
``Brigitte Bardot: Take One,'' in which the actress, now 65, takes
a guileless and pleasantly offhand view of her celebrity. Vadim
calls her a ``royal personality, with her very direct humorous
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Bardot, who came from eccentric but strait-laced parents, was
married to Vadim when they made ``And God Created Woman.'' But
earlier the very notion of the director had upset her father. ``Dad
had a gun in his office, and he showed it to Vadim and said, `If
you touch her, I'll use it,''' she recalls in the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Her relationship with Vadim, a legendary lover and husband of
one screen goddess after another, ended during the filming,
although they continued to work together. Other Bardot films coming
from Anchor Bay include Vadim's ``Please Not Now!'' (1961), a
comedy; ``Come Dance With Me'' (1959); and ``Naughty Girl'' (1956).
</P>
<P>
   Jay Douglas, Anchor Bay's chief movie buyer, said there was no
special occasion for the Bardot titles. Last year he and some
associates had been discussing the greatest of the century in
various categories, and the topic of sexiest women came up. ``And
Bardot has been underexposed on home video,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLE JEOPARDY
</P>
<P>
   In the pretty Northwest, a pretty art dealer (Bruce Greenwood)
with a pretty wife named Libby and a cute son hatches an insurance
scheme that makes it appear that Libby murdered him on their nice
new sailboat. The jury buys it, but this being the movies, Libby
walks free in six years and into the custody of a parole officer
named Travis (Tommy Lee Jones).
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that her supposedly dead husband took off with her
best friend (Annabeth Gish), Libby gives Travis the slip and takes
off to locate the fellow and reclaim her son. But all the
Hitchcockian games are ``more memorable for their settings, like an
elaborate New Orleans cemetery, than for their sense,'' Janet
Maslin wrote in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1999. Paramount. $107.37; DVD, $29.95. 106 minutes. Closed
captioned. R. Release date: Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS
</P>
<P>
   Full of early-'70s irreverence, Alan Rudolph's film plunges into
1950s greed with the wild exuberance of Kurt Vonnegut's 1973 novel.
A model of grotesque self-promotion, the suburban car dealer Dwayne
Hoover (Bruce Willis) has an alienated neurotic for a wife (Barbara
Hershey), a would-be lounge singer for a son (Lukas Hoss) and a
closet transvestite for a partner (Nick Nolte). But while a
sterling cast pumps a lot of adrenaline into the caricatures, the
satire now seems overheated in a movie that ``looks and feels like
a frantic, live-action psychedelic cartoon'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   _ 1999. Hollywood. $104.16. 110 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   BEST LAID PLANS &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Barker's thriller mixes two friends (Alessandro Nivola and
Josh Brolin) and an available young woman (Reese Witherspoon) who
has a sexual encounter with one of them but turns out to have been
the girlfriend of the other. In any event, she ends up gagged and
handcuffed in a visually ambitious but exasperatingly written film
that aspires to the chilly moral ambiguity of ``The Usual
Suspects'' but too often ``seems to be playing ethical dress-up
with film noir crises it can't fully embrace'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   _ 1999. Fox. $104.16; DVD, $34.98. 90 minutes. Closed captioned.
R. Release date: Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   JOE THE KING
</P>
<P>
   Frank Whaley's sincere but wobbly first film does a good enough
job of conveying the embarrassment, panic and despair of a young
boy (Noah Fleiss) growing up dirt poor in a strife-torn household
in upstate New York in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Val Kilmer and Karen Young are the embattled parents who
alternately take out their frustrations on each other and the boy,
who is left to skulk miserably and take up petty crime. Whaley
elicits fine performances.
</P>
<P>
   But individual monologues seem oddly disconnected in a movie
that ``feels unglued, as if crucial sequences had been left on the
cutting-room floor'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   _ 1999. Trimark. $79.99; DVD, $24.99. 100 minutes. Closed
captioned. R.

<P>
   IT HAPPENED HERE and WINSTANLEY. This week two acclaimed films
by Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo are available at reduced prices.
What would have happened if the Nazis had overrun Britain? ``It
Happened Here'' (1966, 96 minutes) vividly imagines such an
occupation. In ``Winstanley'' (1975, 96 minutes), an English
Reformation-era religious sect tries to establish itself on land
coveted by neighboring villagers. In both films, Lawrence Van
Gelder wrote in The New York Times, `` Brownlow and Mollo recreate
a convincing milieu, disdain simplistic reasoning and heroics, and
demonstrate that the riches of a film reside not in its budget but
in the talent and dedication of those who make it.'' Milestone.
$29.95 each. Information: (800) 603-1104.

FLIGHT DELAYED?: WHAT THE AIRLINE OWES YOU AND WHAT MIGHT YOU GET
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   I was trying to get home from Europe, which required changing
planes in Philadelphia. Which was OK, because it was better than
one of the other options, which involved a stop in Tunisia. (Don't
ask.)
</P>
<P>
   It was even OK when the flight from Philadelphia to Fort
Worth-Dallas got canceled because of airline snafus after a
snowstorm. I spent the night at a comfortable airport Sheraton, at
the airline's expense; they also gave me a dinner voucher and a
long-distance phone card and booked me on their first flight to
Fort Worth the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just the beginning. Almost 24 hours later, I did
end up in Texas _ in Houston. (Again, don't ask.) Which was better
than the alternative: spending another night, this time at my own
expense, in Charlotte, N.C. (stop asking), and taking my chances on
getting onto one of the next day's Fort Worth flights.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I got all the way home _ you really don't want to
hear that part _ I was more confused than ever about this: When
your flight is canceled, just exactly what does the airline owe
you? Meals, phone calls, an overnight stay in a plush airport
hotel, a flight somewhere else _ or nothing?
</P>
<P>
   A review of the policies of 10 major U.S.-based airlines reveals
that you might get all of the above. Or some of it. Or maybe zip.
</P>
<P>
   And possibly during the same trip.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, what you get depends on the reason your flight was
scratched. (The airline's fault, you win. The weather, you lose.)
</P>
<P>
   But unofficially, it may also depend on which airline you're
flying, how much you spent on your ticket, whether you fly the
airline frequently, whether you have special needs or are traveling
with children or older people _ and, possibly, the mood of the
people making the decisions that day at that airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you find, when you start looking at it, is that they're
pretty vague promises,'' says Ed Perkins, a consumer advocate for
the American Society of Travel Agents. He is also the former editor
of the Consumer Reports Travel Letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody comes out and says, we will give you a
hotel room. What they say is, we will do whatever is appropriate,
which is simply a way of getting off the hook. ... What you get is
pretty much up to the airline.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the major airlines _ American, Southwest, United,
Delta, TWA, US Airways and the like _ voluntarily adopted plans
aimed at improving customer service. The plans were a kind of
compromise after months of discussion among airline leaders,
legislators and the federal Department of Transportation, and they
cover such topics as the airlines' plans to improve the
availability of airfare and delays information to passengers, calls
for a government review of liability limits for lost luggage, and
improving airline responsiveness to complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are supposed to make this information available to
the public; you can download the plans on each airline's Web site.
These plans also detail what can happen in the case of a flight
being canceled or delayed.
</P>
<P>
   But the only situation that is covered by law is when you lose
your seat on a domestic airline flight because of overbooking.
(Fewer than one in 10,000 domestic passengers is involuntarily
bumped, according to 1999 statistics from the federal Department of
Transportation.)
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, the rules are pretty cut-and-dried: If you get
involuntarily bumped from an overcrowded flight and get to your
final destination more than an hour late, you are paid the cost of
the one-way fare or $200, whichever is less. If the delay is more
than two hours, that amount is doubled.
</P>
<P>
   (This deal applies only if you hold up your end of the bargain.
For instance, if you showed up at the gate late, even if the flight
hadn't departed, you'll likely be out of luck.)
</P>
<P>
   But all other cases are, to some degree, open to interpretation.
Most airlines follow a policy roughly similar to this:
</P>
<P>
   When a flight is canceled or delayed, the airline first tries to
reroute you on their next available flight. If the delay is the
airline's fault, and you can't get to your destination that day,
they'll put you up at a hotel for the night, provided a room is
available. They'll also try to help with meals or other
incidentals. Sometimes, that means they might hand out free
sandwiches and soft drinks in the boarding area; sometimes they'll
give you vouchers to take to airport restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   If the airline doesn't consider the delay to be within their
control _ for instance, if an airport is closed because of ice or
there is a problem at the air-traffic control tower _ you're on
your own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do whatever we need to do to take care of the passenger
if it's something within our control,'' says Mark Kienzel, a
spokesman at Fort Worth-based American Airlines. But ``when it
snows 4 feet in Buffalo there's not much we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   That said, what actually happens can be much murkier _ depending
on who's traveling.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent traveler Judy Goldschmidt, a tourism worker in
Philadelphia, recalls that about a year ago, thunderstorms caused
her to miss a connection between St. Thomas and Philadelphia; she
spent the night in Puerto Rico at her own expense. But she met a
group, which included a passenger using a wheelchair, that received
hotel accommodations, dinner and breakfast, all paid for by the
same airline that had declined to help her.
</P>
<P>
   On a different trip last month, Goldschmidt had to pay for her
room when she got stuck in Florida because of a blizzard on the
East Coast. However, she met other passengers stranded by the same
snowstorm _ but traveling from international destinations _ who
received rooms and meals from the same airline.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the airlines don't agree that some passengers get
preferential treatment _ ``We view all of our customers the same,''
says Beth Harbin of Dallas-based Southwest, famous for its
all-coach policy.
</P>
<P>
   But others say it does happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do try to reward the loyalty of our best customers, those
who have shown they will fly on us often, and we do try to reward
the customers who are spending the most,'' says Kurt Ebenhoch, a
spokesman at Chicago-based United Airlines. Though the airline has
policies on what's given out when, gate agents are given more
leeway with first-class passengers and frequent fliers, among
others, he says.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the airlines say their goal is to minimize the
number of cancellations in the first place _ and to deal with
stranded or delayed passengers more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past year, for instance, United has introduced
portable checkout units that are brought into the gate area during
delays or cancellations. They allow more gate agents to work at the
same time, moving lines along faster, Ebenhoch says. The airline
also has introduced a paging system for Internet-enabled
passengers; go to their Web site before your flight, and you can
arrange to be paged in case of gate changes, delays or
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines point out that the percent of delayed and canceled
flights has hovered at about the same rate for years, somewhere
around 20 to 25 percent. Only a small percent of those flights are
actually canceled.
</P>
<P>
   That does not take into account, however, that airlines are much
busier than a decade ago. About 10 years ago, the flight load, or
average passenger level, was about 60 percent. Today, it's 70
percent or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Cancellations ``may not happen more often (today), but it
probably takes the airlines longer to work out all the kinks,''
says Perkins. ``There aren't as many empty seats, so if your flight
is delayed or canceled, it takes longer to get everybody home.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   So when you run into delays, what other outs do you have?
</P>
<P>
   For one, you can try to get there on another airline. Most major
airlines have interline agreements with other carriers, which means
they will accept each other's tickets if the airline authorizes
such a transfer.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't work with everybody. Southwest, for one, doesn't
have such arrangements with other airlines; if they can't get you
to your destination, they won't send you to another airline, and
other airlines won't accept your Southwest ticket. Southwest counts
on being able to get passengers there through its large number of
daily flights to most of its destinations, says spokeswoman Harbin.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents say your best bet is often pre-planning. Try to
avoid the last flight of the day, avoid connecting flights in
airports with a tendency toward weather problems, and be ready to
negotiate with gate agents if there's a delay, says Steve Loucks,
director of public relations for the Carlson Wagonlit Travel chain.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, an airline ticket is a contract, points out consumer
advocate Perkins. So, if you don't get the service you contracted
for, you have the right to sue. Don't expect to recover damages _
``You can't really say, `I missed the flight and lost a
million-dollar business deal, so you owe me a million dollars,' ''
Perkins says.
</P>
<P>
   But if you file in small claims court, you stand a fair chance
of recovering costs directly related to the canceled flight,
Perkins says. This might include the cost of a hotel room, meals,
transportation, long-distance phone calls and/or an additional
higher-priced airline ticket.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Perkins says he has heard of few travelers who
actually go to all that trouble. Which is easy to understand. If
you've ever had to spend an extra 30 or 40 hours on the road, like
I just did, by the time you get home, you'd rather just forget the
whole thing.

NAVIGATING YOUR OPTIONS WHEN YOUR FLIGHT IS CANCELED
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. Try to avoid booking the last flight of the day to your
destination, particularly at times of the year when weather might
cause delays. And if you have a choice, avoid making connections in
cities where weather is more likely to create problems.
</P>
<P>
   2. If your flight gets canceled, be assertive, but stay polite.
The gate agents didn't make the decision to ground your plane and
they don't have the power to fix it or change the weather _ but
they do have the power to get you home more quickly, or to make you
more comfortable while you're stranded.
</P>
<P>
   3. If the lines to talk to a gate agent are long, go to a phone
instead, and call the airline or a travel agent to check your
options. Speed counts when there's a crush of canceled flights, as
flights and hotel rooms fill up quickly, says consumer advocate Ed
Perkins. And it probably will be faster to re-book on the phone
than to wait at the gate. In any event, the more specific
information you have about other flights, the better.
</P>
<P>
   4. Don't be afraid to ask to be put on another airline instead.
The airline will prefer to book you on its next available flight,
but most major airlines have interline agreements that allow them
to transfer you to another carrier, says consumer advocate Ed
Perkins. (If you do this, make sure you get the airline to validate
your transfer, so you don't have to pay anything to the new
airline.)
</P>
<P>
   5. Know the basic rules of what the airline owes you. If a
cancellation is the airline's fault, you ought to get lodging and
food on its dime. It it's anything else _ from weather to air
traffic control problems to airport delays _ the airline probably
owes you nothing, but may be willing to accommodate some requests.
It never hurts to ask. In addition to rooms and meals, many will
give away long-distance phone cards worth up to $10 and toiletry
kits for those who can't reclaim baggage.
</P>
<P>
   6. If you're not given free accommodations, ask for a list of
hotels that offer ``distressed passenger'' rates; these are
discounts offered to passengers stranded by weather or other
airport problems. Some airlines may help you book a room at one of
these hotels.

weather and airline foul-ups, a trip home from Europe that was
supposed to take about 18 hours took me nearly 60, involving one
canceled flight, one diversion, several delays and a free night in
a Philadelphia hotel. But it raised this question: When your flight
is canceled, just what do airlines owe you? Hotel accommodations,
meal vouchers, long-distance phone calls _ or nothing? We check
with the major domestic airlines to see what their policies are. By

`FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON': GETTING SMARTER ISN'T NECESSARILY GETTING
HAPPIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Program notes at end of review. Time, channel are for New York

(af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlie Gordon is a tough role for any actor. Oscar voters
recognized that and gave Cliff Robertson the best actor award for
the 1968 film ``Charly.'' (Spelling consistency has never been the
entertainment industry's strong suit.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Matthew Modine takes on the challenge in a CBS movie,
``Flowers for Algernon'' (the title of the Daniel Keyes novel on
which both films are based), and while he does an admirable job,
the resulting film makes Robertson's achievement seem all the more
astonishing in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie is a mentally retarded man who is asked to participate
in an experiment. He undergoes surgery that gradually increases his
IQ, not to make him normal but to turn him into a genius. The
experiment works, and it changes his life in innumerable ways, some
of them unwelcome. And, it turns out, there's a catch.
</P>
<P>
   In the new film, which has its premiere on CBS on Sunday night,
Charlie's first glimmer of recognition comes when his fellow bakery
employees make fun of him, as they always have, and he realizes he
doesn't think the idea of ``pulling a Charlie Gordon'' is so funny
anymore. He is feeling the first taste of dignity, born of new
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   When the transformation results in a romance with his teacher,
Alice (Kelli Williams of ABC's legal drama ``The Practice''),
Modine's Charlie remains childlike and gentle. In the same
situation, Robertson's character took on a more traditional
masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years later, what is remembered about Charly is his
subtle but excruciating emotional evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations and reactions of today's Charlie seem
one-layered, and his brilliance often comes across as just
obnoxious. That's especially true when he turns film critic after
seeing ``Anna Karenina'' with Alice. ``They reduced the novel _
excuse the cinematic reference _ to black and white,'' he
pronounces.
</P>
<P>
   Some attitudes in ``Flowers for Algernon'' seem dated and
offensive now. Ron Rifkin, as the doctor conducting the experiment,
refers to Charlie as ``one of nature's mistakes.'' But the film has
its charms. The love scene between Charlie and Alice is discreet,
tender and very touching, and the story succeeds in being a
tearjerker.
</P>
<P>
   Algernon, incidentally, is the lab mouse who undergoes the same
surgery as Charlie. He has problems, too. &QL;

   NBC has been shameless in recent seasons about exploiting
viewers' musical memories in order to boost ratings. ``Little
Richard,'' the network's latest effort in that area, may be uneven
and at times lazy, but at least it conveys a frank, joyous love of
its subject. Or maybe the credit for that should go to the film's
star.
</P>
<P>
   The actor known as Leon plays Ricardo Wayne Penniman, who in the
early 1950s (as he will enthusiastically remind you) may have
invented rock 'n' roll. He captures Little Richard's enthusiastic
narcissism as well as his magnetic stage presence.
</P>
<P>
   The story follows the singer from Macon, Ga., to New Orleans to
international fame. It begins as a father-and-son drama, focusing
on the parent's reaction of horror to the child's effeminacy, and
makes strong points about racism before turning into a traditional
rags-to-riches story. (He presents his mother with a big pink
mansion and buys lots of clothes.)
</P>
<P>
   But ``Little Richard'' does a good job of celebrating the energy
and excitement of early rock 'n' roll. Even if the crosscutting
between Richard's and Pat Boone's versions of ``Long Tall Sally''
goes on a little too long, it's priceless. In the end, Leon and
Little Richard have something crucial in common: just a little
touch of star quality. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A winter storm will bring a potpourri of precipitation to the
Northeast and Great Lakes on Friday as low pressure tracks
northeastward from the Ohio Valley. At daybreak, snow will be
falling at a fast rate from northern Pennsylvania to northern
Illinois. During the day, warmer air will stream up and over a
layer of subfreezing air, causing the snow to change to sleet in
portions of the interior Northeast. Precipitation will commence as
snow Friday morning along the Northeast seaboard but will change to
rain near the coast. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 10 inches are
expected during Friday and Friday night from near Chicago to near
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, humid air streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico
will fuel numerous showers and thunderstorms from the Tennessee
Valley to the middle Ohio Valley on Friday. Some of the storms may
be severe, replete with damaging winds and hail. A few of the
showers and storms will reach the Carolina coast by evening.
Unseasonably warm air will continue to cover Texas and the
Southeastern states. Amid plentiful sunshine, afternoon
temperatures will reach well into the '70s across the region with
80-degree readings across most of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Sinking currents of air associated with high pressure will
promote sunshine and seasonable temperatures from the Northwest to
the northern Plains. Generally dry weather will also prevail
farther south across California and the Southwest though spotty
snow showers will pepper many of the west-facing mountain slopes of
the central Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Caboose Storm
</P>
<P>
   The storm system that will produce wintry precipitation across
the Northeast on Friday marks the last in a series of Pacific
disturbances to streak across the nation in the speedy southern
branch of the jet stream. Typically, such a ``caboose'' jet stream
disturbance marks the end of the existing weather pattern and a
switch to a new regime. Indeed, instead of the current pattern of
two swift tributaries of the jet stream, the southern branch will
weaken, slowing the eastward progress of Pacific disturbances,
while the northern branch recedes northward, virtually locking cold
air in Canada.

&HT;     GO FUR IT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When animal rights zealots opposed to the wearing
of fur disrupted the recent spring New York fashion extravaganza
with their familiar scare tactics, they were figuratively beating a
dead horse _ or rather a dead mink.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators leapt up, waved banners reading ``fur shame,'' and
tossed a tofu pie at the runway. But the rude antics didn't stop
the parade of fur-trimmed clothes, which were wildly applauded as
they came down the runways.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward a resigned spokesperson for People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals (PETA) called it ``our last hurrah.'' It was a
graceless and overdue retreat from a socially worthless enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago, however, PETA and its allies sent the
fur industry into a slump with a brash crusade to persuade or
frighten women into dumping their elegant and warm fox, raccoon,
sable and mink coats in favor of wrapping up in wool. (Sheep are
politically correct, being luckier than other animals prized for
their coats. After they are sheared, they live on to be sheared
again.)
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive campaign, marked by sneak attacks that spattered
paint on women wearing fur coats on the streets, intimidated
individuals and the industry for awhile. But gradually the feminine
desire for beautiful outer garments has overcome feelings of guilt
about wearing the pelts of murdered animals.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost a half-century since Richard Nixon saved his
own political skin by immortalizing his wife's preference for a
``good Republican cloth coat.'' He was sending a message of false
humility, not one of outrage over animal assassination. In any
case, Patricia Nixon promptly donned a mink after they finally made
it to the White House in 1968 and cloth coats have not been
identified with Republicans since.
</P>
<P>
   The last straw for PETA was a referendum last year to force
fancy Beverly Hills shops to attach labels to fur coats describing
the POSSIBLE (not necessarily actual) murderous methods by which
pelts meet their fate. The idea was that if purchasers saw tags
describing cruelty to animals, the fur industry would go out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Hills may be full of spoiled rich folks, but they are
not fools. They rejected the nuttiness and with that elite
endorsement fur has soared again.
</P>
<P>
   Coat sales have rebounded. One industry report says sales are up
25 percent over last year. Supermodels who used to pose nude in
anti-fur advertisements are now seen shamelessly flaunting mink.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the economy. Maybe it's resentment against the
moralizing of single-minded zealots. Maybe it's just the sheer joy
of wearing a nice fur.
</P>
<P>
   So PETA is shifting its energies to a new target. Now PETA has
announced it is going after leather, also the product of skinning
dead animals. Leather, by this logic, is just hairless fur.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is particularly upset about the apparently
brutal methods in India of slaughtering cattle, whose processed
hides are shipped to the United States and Europe. A video of
alleged Indian cattle torture is circulating in Britain to try to
arouse animal lovers. Cattle in the United States are killed in a
more humane way.
</P>
<P>
   This may also be the beginning of a broader campaign against
eating meat; how can you oppose the use of an animal's outside
while enjoying its cooked insides? These PETA people really think
big.
</P>
<P>
   But tackling leather, let alone meat-eating, is going to be a
tough sell. A really tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   Fur is a luxury. We can do without it, even if we fantasize
looking gorgeous in a fluffy Russian red fox hood, just like Julie
Christie in the classic film ``Doctor Zhivago.''
</P>
<P>
   But leather is an accessory necessity and is more versatile than
cotton, canvas, rubber or tree leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Think purses, belts, shoes, watch straps, luggage, billfolds,
vests.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone for wooden shoes? Plastic handbags? Rope belts? Ugh. For
kindergarten kids, maybe. Not for adults.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion industry is currently in love with leather jackets,
coats, pants and boots. Suits with pockets and cuffs trimmed in
leather are hot. Very handsome they are, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the shoe problem is the real stickler here. Going barefoot
is not a culturally acceptable alternative in boardrooms or most
places outside the beach. Sneakers also have their social
limitations. Comfortable, yes. Appropriate everywhere, no.
</P>
<P>
   Both the clunky shoes and stiletto heels now favored by
fashionable women require leather soles, no matter what strange
nonsense dictates the design of the rest of the shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement of PETA's new campaign would seem a tad awkward.
Will this lead to a rash of purse-grabbing, with the culprits
explaining that they were merely doing research into the question
of leather vs. plastic _ not stealing the money inside?
</P>
<P>
   Will advocates creep along the floor of movie theaters peering
at the soles of feet stretched out along the aisles, to nab those
violators who aren't decked out in canvas and rubber-soled Dockers?
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean anyone approves of cruelty to animals. But a
wholesale assault upon legitimate industries that provide a product
people have liked and used for centuries is not a productive way to
advance a cause. It is only a maddening nuisance.

   &UR; POLLS SHOW BUSH AND McCAIN IN CLOSE S.C. RACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By STEWART M. POWELL and DAN FREEDMAN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C.2000 _ Hearst Newspapers &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   FLORENCE, S.C. _ With polls showing Texas Gov. George W. Bush
slightly ahead two days before South Carolina's Republican
presidential primary, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. urged Democrats and
independents Thursday to join Republicans to help him win.
</P>
<P>
   Launching a final 48-hour cross-state dash from the piedmont to
the seashore and back again, McCain asked for the support of
conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a party that welcomes the Reagan Democrats of old''
McCain told a rally in Greenville, in northwestern South Carolina.
``I want a party that says, `Come on in, come on in, there's room
for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused McCain of continuing negative ads despite McCain's
promise not to do so. Bush described as `factually untrue'' a
McCain campaign flyer that says Bush's tax plan would fail to put
`one red cent'' into saving Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted that his plan would funnel $2 trillion of the
projected $4 trillion federal budget surplus into debt relief and
restoring the financial health of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Greenville, McCain defended his advertising as
`an accurate representation'' of Bush's tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days before the Saturday primary, polls showed Bush
with a slight lead in a close race race. The latest Palmetto Poll,
released Thursday, showed Bush leading McCain by two percentage
points, 49 percent to 47 percent, with a 3.3. percentage-point
margin of error. Former Reagan administration official Alan Keyes
trailed far behind with four percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll _ directed by David Woodard, a political scientist at
Clemson University _ also projects turnout of between 350,000 and
370,000, which would be a record. In 1996 when former Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole beat conservative commentator Patrick
Buchanan, 276,000 ballots were cast.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard said turnout would be the key. Bush is running way ahead
in most polls among Republicans and if turnout stays in the 350,000
range, `Bush should be OK,'' Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   But if turnout goes over 400,000 with independents and Democrats
turning out in large numbers to participate in the open primary,
`Bush could be in trouble,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the Charleston Post and Courier and WCBD-TV showed
Bush with 45 percent and McCain with 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters `I feel like we have a good chance. I'm
taking nothing for granted, however.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, `I actually thought I'd win New Hampshire. I
guess I'm not a good forecaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that, win or lose in South Carolina, he intends to
continue his campaign in upcoming primaries in Michigan and Arizona
next week.
</P>
<P>
   With polls give Bush a big edge among Republican voters, McCain
is banking on support from independents and Democrats, the same
kind of voters who propelled McCain to a landslide victory over
Bush in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been sort of criticized by the fact that we are
attracting independents and Democrats,'' McCain told an
enthusiastic audience of veterans in Spartanburg, S.C. ``I'm proud
that anyone would flock to our banner. This is about the future of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain told reporters later: ``We used to proudly call them
Reagan Democrats and I'd like to reassemble that coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator has started making more frequent off-hand
references to his distinguished 22-year Navy career in the final
days of a campaign in a state with the highest proportion of
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a Navy pilot shot down over North Vietnam and imprisoned
for five years, is being accompanied by fellow POWs. ``If you see
any really old guys, you'll know I was in prison with them,''
McCain told the rally in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   McCain tells audiences of incidents at book signings for his
autobiography, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' where ordinary veterans
come forward with mementos of their service to the nation. He jokes
that his wife Cindy believes he may be running for president
because of the ``knocks on the head'' he suffered during torture by
North Vietnamese guards.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They look as if they're waiting to be immortalized by
Norman Rockwell, these open-faced Brooklyn lads, but it's clear
that they've got the itch, and bad. Restless, randy, hungry for
action: you've seen their kind before in American musicals, ready
to erupt into violent dance and show-stopping anthems of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, when this quartet sings, in the opening minutes of
``Saturday Night,'' a 40-some-year-old show that is just now having
its official New York premiere, the voices are often soft and
reflective, and the melody they carry keeps sliding away from
forthright buoyancy, as if retreating from hope.
</P>
<P>
   It's a charming, even funny number about nothing more serious
than being single and not having a date. But its wistful quality is
bottomless. When the singers observe that ``alive and alone on a
Saturday night is dead,'' the hyperbole is sincerely felt.
</P>
<P>
   That mood tinges all of ``Saturday Night,'' which opened
Thursday night at the Second Stage Theater here, lending a gentle
power to a show with a slight, contrived book and a decidedly dated
air. It also sets off echoes sure to stir the hearts of aficionados
of the American musical.
</P>
<P>
   The title song of ``Saturday Night,'' written for characters on
the cusp of adulthood, was created by a young composer on the edge
of maturity. Stephen Sondheim, then in his mid-20s, had been given
his first chance to write the complete score and lyrics for a
Broadway show. The musical, which was tabled after the death of its
40-year-old producer, Lemuel Ayers, would remain unproduced for
four decades, itself a story of hopes brightening and dimming.
</P>
<P>
   During its long consignment to limbo, Sondheim quickly graduated
into shiny success. He also continued to write about the pain of
hoping to connect. ``Alone is alone, not alive,'' goes a lyric from
``Company,'' the show that established his reputation as the bard
of urban anxieties. Look closely and you'll see the same yearning
face in ``Saturday Night.''
</P>
<P>
   The startling, expressive talent that gives voice to that
yearning may still be embryonic in ``Saturday Night,'' but it is
definitely there. Kathleen Marshall, the inventive choreographer
(``Kiss Me, Kate'') and the artistic director of the Encores!
musical concert series, has staged ``Saturday Night'' with an
understanding that it has to be treated delicately for its
particular and prophetic charms to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   This tale of coming of age in Flatbush on the eve of the 1929
stock market crash is burdened with a sluggish book by Julius J.
Epstein and characters who suggest a middle-class answer to the
Bowery Boys. It is not made for slam-bang showmanship. Overselling
its tame-seeming streetwise comedy and tentative love story would
sink it.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, Marshall has encouraged her fresh-faced cast, led by the
Australian cabaret star David Campbell and Lauren Ward (``Violet,''
``1776''), to shimmer instead of dazzle. Marshall's choreography
correspondingly emphasizes imaginative wit over calisthenic flash.
It is as if the production were introducing a shy but very talented
child, who must be coaxed instead of pushed into the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Like Derek McLane's sets, which present a vision of New York as
storybook-innocent in its way as that of the movie ``Stuart
Little,'' the overall production has an aura of nostalgia that's
knowing without being snide. Based on ``Front Porch in Flatbush,''
an autobiographical play by the brothers Julius J. and Philip G.
Epstein (screenwriters on ``Casablanca''), ``Saturday Night''
follows the fortunes of a group of Brooklyn chums eager to get
lucky, both financially and sexually.
</P>
<P>
   At their center is the charismatic Gene ( Campbell), at the
house of whose conveniently absent father much of the action takes
place. An order clerk on Wall Street, Gene has been infected with
get-rich fever and a taste for glamour. Trying to crash a dance at
the Plaza Hotel, he meets a fancy Southern debutante type who turns
out to be Helen ( Ward), just another pretender from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The central, oddly gnarled plot is about how Gene's aspirations
to grandeur get him into trouble. It is not, to tell the truth, a
gripping or believable story, and its adult version of adolescent
humor, wide-eyed with the hint of a leer, must have seemed stale
even in the 1950's.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the show's message _ abandon ambition, be yourself
and stay at home _ is a downer, given the subliminal ache of
longing that informs so much of the music. You get the idea that
most of these characters will indeed spend all their Saturday
nights at home in Brooklyn. No matter what the script intends, this
does not register as a gladdening thought.
</P>
<P>
   But the composer of ``Saturday Night'' is already aware that
``happy endings can spring a leak,'' as a Sondheim lyric from a
later show observes. It's the tug between the conventional
all-American hominess of the script and the suggestions of
ambivalence in its score that make ``Saturday Night'' more than a
dismissible piece of juvenalia. The show has dreary stretches, but
it leaves a sweetly haunting afterglow.
</P>
<P>
   As orchestrated by the extraordinary Jonathan Tunick, a longtime
collaborator of Sondheim's, the score seems forever balanced
between wise-guy jauntiness and lyric gravity. It's an appealing
combination that gives us, on the one hand, several truly exquisite
ballads (``So Many People,'' ``What More Do I Need?'') and, on the
other, comic treats like the ensemble number ``That Kind of a
Neighborhood,'' a paean to life in Brooklyn that anticipates the
satiric lyrics of ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see glimmers of the hungry words to ``Some People'' from
``Gypsy'' in ``Class,'' Gene's hymn to upward mobility, a song
notable for underpinning brassy affirmation with minor-key doubts.
And the pastiche master that Sondheim would prove himself to be in
``Follies'' is prefigured here in the piano rag of the overture and
the wonderfully droll crooner piece ``Love's a Bond,'' which
translates the language of romance into that of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim's celebrated verbal dexterity comes through slyly in
the sustained financial metaphors of that song, performed in wry
period style by Donald Corren, with simple language in deft
combinations. (``This bond if you get it/is stable and yet it/will
grow if you let it/mature.'') Not every set of lyrics is that
smooth. But who else would manage to find an internal rhyme for sex
in the middle initial of Francis X. Bushman, the silent movie star?
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday Night'' has been given full productions only twice
previously, at the Bridewell Theater in London (1997) and by the
Pegasus Players in Chicago (1999). In introducing the show to New
York, Marshall doesn't make the mistake of deconstructing something
that most people haven't seen in any form. There's neither
retrospective winking nor heavy-handed dragging of dark emotions to
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the approach is largely to let the score set the tone
for everything else in the show, starting with the soft-pedaled
whimsy of Marshall's choreography. There's a delightful sequence in
which Gene's pals float through a Park Avenue apartment on roller
skates brandishing the accouterments of high-society life and a
winningly graceful and unsalacious interpretation of ``Exhibit A,''
a lesson in the art of seducing a girl, adroitly performed by
Christopher Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In vocal terms, it's hard to imagine a better cast. Michael
Benjamin Washington, Kirk McDonald, Greg Zola and Joey Sorge bring
just the right sharpness and restraint to the intricacies of the
twice-reprised title song. Clarke Thorell and Andrea Burns, as the
show's token married couple, generate a spontaneous feeling of
speech in singing a duet about their first date.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, the image of the Arrow Shirt man come to life, looks
perfect for a magnetic leader of a fledgling white-collar pack, and
as expected, he sings with clear and appealing tunefulness. What he
fails to convey, crucially, is his character's explosive, unstable
side; this Gene is too easy to domesticate.
</P>
<P>
   Ward isn't entirely comfortable with the comic Southern accent
of her first song, which has to be exaggerated for the number to
work. Once that's out of the way, she inhabits her sketchily
written character with a thoroughness that makes her the focal
point of every scene she's in. And she brings a fine emotional
elegance to her love songs.
</P>
<P>
   There is also one heart-stopping scene in which the faces of
Campbell and Ward betray almost too much. ``Saturday Night'' ends,
as musicals of its period usually did, with a finale promising
domestic bliss for its leading lovers. But it's the number that
concludes the first act that you're more likely to remember.
</P>
<P>
   It happens just after Gene has announced to his friends his
intention of marrying Helen, a declaration that takes everyone,
including Helen, by surprise. As the ensemble rousingly sings of
the pros and cons of marriage, it hoists the lovers onto its
shoulders. Gene and Helen exchange a glance just then, and it is
filled with naked terror. Relationships are scary things. Sondheim
has spent much of his subsequent career exploring this basic truth.

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Danny Glover in
a scene from ``Freedom Song.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Danny Glover has always been a magnetic performer, but lately
he's taken it to a new level.
 &HT;    The actor recently had screws removed from his foot and ankle
following surgery, and he's promoting the healing process by
resting his bare feet and ankles in a round, metal tray that
generates a magnetic field around them.
 &HT;    It's a strange contrast to the rest of the luxurious suite at
The Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena, Calif., where Glover is promoting
``Freedom Song,'' a Turner Network Television movie about the
civil-rights movement set to air on Feb. 27.
 &HT;    The saga of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's
efforts to integrate Southern towns and enfranchise
African-Americans in the early 1960s isn't actually as far removed
from turn-of-the-millennium Pasadena as one might think, Glover
believes.
 &HT;    ``I lived this history,'' he says, ``because the other
revolutionary thing that happened at that time in the '50s and '60s
was television.
 &HT;    ``I saw this stuff on television every night,'' he recalls. ``I
saw the Montgomery boycott _ I was 8 years old, but I knew about
those things. My parents were postal workersand talked about those
things and joined organizations. As a child it became part of my
cultural reality, even though I grew up in a city that was
considered very progressive, San Francisco.''
 &HT;    Glover plays Will, a solid, hard-working citizen of the
fictional town of Quinlan, Miss. The civil-rights movement has
arrived in the person of an SNCC organizer, and Will's teen-age son
_ played by Vicellous Reon Shannon, who co-starred in ``The
Hurricane'' (1999) _ joins the campaign, even though in doing so he
jeopardizes his relationship with his father.
 &HT;    ``Will is in the middle of a typical father-son relationship _
one in which the father wants to nurture and protect the boy and
doesn't want him to get hurt,'' Glover says. ``He knows his son
will have to fight his own battles, as every generation does, but
he's also aware that his son might become a casualty in those
struggles, so he's very worried.''
 &HT;    Will's experience is much like that of many African-American men
in the postwar years, the actor adds.
 &HT;    ``African-American soldiers came back from World War II and
said, `In France I was treated as a human being, in England I was
treated as a human being _ and when I came back, black men still
wearing their uniforms and medals were being burned and lynched and
castrated,''' Glover says. ``Will knows he's entitled to more, but
at the same time, because of having to protect his family, he loses
that sense of entitlement in the face of intense fear.''
 &HT;    Glover, who achieved the kind of fame and fortune accorded very
few black actors when he teamed with good friend Mel Gibson for
four ``Lethal Weapon'' movies beginning in 1987, says his own
political activism began at San Francisco State University.
 &HT;    ``I was a student activist before I was an actor,'' Glover says,
his words tumbling over one another in recollected excitement.
``Thirty years ago I was involved in issues like ending apartheid,
developing an ethnic-studies department, fighting for the
liberation of the African colonies. I was always involved, whether
it was with the McGovern campaign, the radicalization of the
civil-rights movement, the Vietnam War or the Black Panther Party _
all of that was part of my culture. The first acting I did was in
radical agitprop theater.''
 &HT;    Now a star, Glover hasn't strayed far from those roots, acting
in and often producing several films and television movies aimed at
educating African-Americans about their history.
 &HT;    He's also an outspoken critic of the lack of minority faces in
network-television shows, but decades in the entertainment business
have left him a cold-eyed realist as well.
 &HT;    ``The networks deal primarily in making money,'' he says. ``If
the demographics show that the people watching my show may be 30 to
40 percent black, and only 10 percent of them are going to go out
and buy the products advertised on the show, why would they waste
their time with them?
 &HT;    ``Network people are not mean-spirited,'' Glover adds, ``but
they have a cultural framework in which they work, and that
cultural framework is that African-Americans are still second
bananas. We may have African-Americans elected to high office and
African-American millionaires, but 51 percent of the incarcerated
population are still African-Americans, and African-American
unemployment is still double digits.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Glover says he isn't an angry man. The father of a
22-year-old daughter, he considers himself a constructive
pragmatist, interested in change instead of conflict for its own
sake.
 &HT;    Not long ago the actor stood helplessly on a New York street as
taxicab after taxicab passed him by _ because, he was sure, they
are reluctant to pick up black passengers. Instead of launching
legal action or holding a protest rally, he filed a complaint with
the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission and began a much-needed
dialogue with the drivers _ most of whom are themselves minority
members.
 &HT;    ``It was not my intention to instigate any punitive action
against the cab drivers,'' he says. ``I said from Day 1 I wanted to
begin a discourse between the drivers, the taxicab owners and those
people who are the victims of this kind of racial profiling.
 &HT;    ``It's about more than me,'' Glover adds. ``It happens thousands
of times a day to people who are not as conspicuous as I am. And I
felt only through a discourse could we put all of our feelings on
the table.
 &HT;    ``My intention was to do something we don't get to do very often
in a very polarized society _ talk to each other and understand and
have compassion for each other.''
 &HT;    Next up for Glover is ``Boesman and Lena,'' co-starring Angela
Bassett and due out later this year. Based on the Athol Fugard
play, it was shot in South Africa.
 &HT;    Some people point to stars such as himself and Bassett as proof
that there's no systemic discrimination against blacks in today's
Hollywood, but Glover begs to differ.
 &HT;    ``Every actor has a difficult time at the beginning,'' he says.
``The only difference between me and a white actor is that I had to
create a space for me to even be in the industry. The white actor
has a space _ whether he gets in or not depends on certain
variables, but they're not the same variables I had to deal with.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, we've done well, the handful of us who've made it,'' he
concludes, ``but that doesn't absolve us of the responsibility. We
are the exception, not the rule.''

<P>
   When Richard Charlton-Jones was cataloging some old master
paintings at Benacre Hall, a Palladian villa near Lowestoft in
Suffolk, England, he spotted a small wood panel painted with a
Madonna and Child flanked by a pair of angels. It was small,
measuring only 8 by 10 inches, and was painted on gold ground.
</P>
<P>
   Charlton-Jones, a director of the old master paintings
department at Sotheby's in London, said he found the work a bit
perplexing. ``It was obviously very old and rare,'' he said. ``I
took it back to London and began researching it.''
</P>
<P>
   After putting the work to sophisticated tests to determine the
age of the wood and the pigments, he discovered that the panel
dated from the late 13th century and that the pigments were
Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many parallels to Cimabue,'' he said, referring to
the Italian painter and mosaicist who predated both Giotto and
Duccio. ``I got nervous and took it to Dillian Gordon, the curator
of early Italian paintings at the National Gallery in London, who
had just acquired two early pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The two experts studied the work together and concluded that it
was by Cimabue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Madonna and Child Enthroned With Angels'' will be
auctioned at Sotheby's in London on July 6. It is expected to fetch
$3.2 million. This will be the first time a Cimabue has been
offered at auction.
</P>
<P>
   The work, Charlton-Jones said, is part of a small tabernacle, a
portion of which is in the Frick Collection. Even though the
similarities were striking from photographs, he and Gordon took the
panel to New York to study alongside the one in the Frick. They
asked curators from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to examine the
two panels with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two were virtually the same size,'' said Charlton-Jones.
While the Frick panel has been the subject of scholarly debate and
is only labeled ``Tuscan school,'' Charlton-Jones said he was now
certain the two were part of the same tabernacle.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's portion probably formed the top left, which depicted
scenes from the life of Jesus, and the Frick's is thought to have
been from the bottom right.
</P>
<P>
   The angels, the Virgin Mary's throne and the drapery are all
identical in style to another Madonna and Child by Cimabue that is
in the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   ``This painting is one of only seven or eight independent panel
paintings by Cimabue that survive,'' Charlton-Jones said. ``And
this is the only one in private hands.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Owned to Loaned
</P>
<P>
   In what it described as a ``sensitive solution,'' the Israel
Museum announced this week that it had transferred one of its
prized paintings, Pissarro's ``Boulevard Montmartre: Spring''
(1897), to Gerta Silberberg, the daughter-in-law of Max Silberberg,
a Jewish industrialist and collector from Breslau, Germany, who was
killed in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Silberberg is now considered the legal owner of the painting,
but she has agreed to let the museum keep it on its walls as a
long-term loan.
</P>
<P>
   Records that were opened after the Silberberg estate made a
claim to the painting in 1998 showed that it had been sold at
auction in Berlin in 1935 and passed through several owners until
1960, when the Manhattan gallery Knoedler &AMP; Co. sold it to John and
Frances L. Loeb, New York philanthropists.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we got the claim in July, we began investigating
it,'' said James Snyder, the Israel Museum's director. The museum
even brought in Joachim and Lionel Pissarro, great-grandsons of the
artist who are authorities on his work, to help.
</P>
<P>
   The Loebs had promised the painting to the museum in 1985 to
honor Teddy Kollek, the former mayor of Jerusalem who is the
museum's founder and honorary president, on the institution's
20th-anniversary. It entered the museum's collection after Loeb's
death in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Silberberg recovered a van Gogh drawing, ``Olive Trees
With the Alpilles Range in the Background,'' that had been hanging
in the National Gallery in Berlin. In December she sold it at
Sotheby's in London.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer was Ronald Lauder, who donated it to the Museum of
Modern Art, of which he is chairman. He paid $8.5 million, a record
for a van Gogh drawing. Silberberg said she planned to use some of
the proceeds to finance a search for other missing works. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Prize for Pixels
</P>
<P>
   The Tate Gallery in London has the Turner Prize, and the Solomon
R. Guggenheim Museum in New York has the Hugo Boss Prize. Now the
San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has come up with the Webby Prize
for Excellence in Online Art, a $50,000 award to be given annually
for a body of work that is primarily experienced online.
</P>
<P>
   The international competition is open to anyone who wants to
enter. Entries will be accepted from Tuesday to March 14.
Guidelines are available on three Web sites: www.webbyawards.com,
www.sfmoma.org and www.iadas.net.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will be chosen by a panel that includes Gary Hill,
the Seattle video artist; John Maeda, a professor of media arts and
sciences at the MIT Media Lab; Machiko Kusahara, a media art
curator and assistant professor in the Graduate School of Science
and Technology at Kobe University in Japan; and Femke Wolting, the
curator of the Exploding Cinema, the experimental film division of
the International Film Festival in Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will be announced on May 11 and will be featured on
the museum's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pushing online art to the forefront,'' said Benjamin
Weil, the museum's curator of media arts. ``It's hard to tell, but
we'll probably get about 1,000 applications. We're hoping to
discover work we haven't been aware of. This is a new form of being
informed.'' &QL;

   Getty's Choice
</P>
<P>
   The J. Paul Getty Trust has named Thomas Crow director of the
Getty Research Institute. Crow, who has been the chairman of the
Yale University art history department for four years, will replace
Salvatore Settis, who resigned last year. &QL;

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BEACH,' starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton and
Robert Carlyle. Directed by Danny Boyle (R, 120 minutes). DiCaprio
plays Richard, a young American vacationing in Thailand who is
given a map that leads him to an island paradise. All of DiCaprio's
charisma and the director's savvy are used to divert us from the
fact that there's not much going on here. While DiCaprio shows some
talent, the movie is simply a Colors by Benetton take on ``Lord of
the Flies,'' with the imperious paradise ruler (Swinton) holding
court as the Promised Land crashes around her. Richard finds
himself living the aphorism that has ruined the life of so many
film protagonists: paradise breeds callousness, a marginal
rethinking of beware of the things you want, for you shall have
them (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of last year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,' starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron
and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes).
Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue of
abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a
Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely
World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the
world. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an
orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs
abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple
(Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but
smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 1940s
``David Copperfield'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `EYE OF THE BEHOLDER,' starring Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd.
Directed by Stephan Elliott (R, 105 minutes). McGregor is a British
surveillance expert and Judd the serial-killing femme fatale he
falls in love with (while observing her kill a boyfriend) in this
ludicrous psycho-thriller. As McGregor's character, known only as
the Eye, follows the object of his obsession from city to city, the
movie tries futilely to capture some of the mystique of
``Vertigo.'' But the film, by the director best known for ``The
Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,'' is so garish,
disjointed and incoherent that it feels like an extended music
video posing as a movie (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `GIRL, INTERRUPTED,' starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie.
Directed by James Mangold (R, 120 minutes). Except for being
several years too old for the role, Winona Ryder, an actress who
oozes high-strung intelligence, is ideally cast as Susanna Kaysen,
a college-age girl who lands in a Massachusetts mental institution
in 1967 after a halfhearted suicide attempt. (The movie is based on
Kaysen's memoir.) The period details are perfect, and Ryder has the
courage to make her character a pain in the neck. But the small,
introspective movie is nearly stolen by Jolie as a charismatic,
brutally truth-telling sociopath who becomes Susanna's best friend
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE GREEN MILE,' starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan,
David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written
and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the
death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments,
the director of ``The Shawshank Redemption'' could have managed
more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock.
Still, this long film is vivid and well played. Smooth ensemble
acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic condemned man
(Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities, which gives the
film its mixture of religious overtones and mild horror. Hanks, as
a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectedly good that it's
redundant to say so (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GUN SHY,' starring Liam Neeson, Oliver Platt, Jose Zuniga and
Sandra Bullock. Written and directed by Eric Blakeney (R, 102
minutes). Last spring saw both a film comedy (``Analyze This'') and
a cable series (``The Sopranos'') about gangsters forcing
themselves to unload to a shrink. This year, in ``Gun Shy,'' we get
a shaken undercover fed, Charlie Mayo (Neeson), seeing a
psychiatrist on the down-low. Charlie, a wreck who has lost his
nerve after he was exposed during an undercover operation, is
assigned to a job that involves his acting as an organized-crime
envoy. He moves between the preening Fidel (Zuniga), a yuppie
Colombian thug, and Fulvio (Platt), whose vulgar pride in his
violent streak is perverse. Blakeney has come up with one of the
subtlest and most inspired comedies you'll see this year in his
feature-film writing and directing debut (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `HOLY SMOKE,' starring Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel. Directed
by Jane Campion (R, 95 minutes). Having roamed so gorgeously
through North Africa as a young hippie mother in ``Hideous Kinky,''
Winslet this time appears in India as Ruth Barron, a headstrong
young Australian seeking enlightenment. Eventually Ruth's mother
coaxes her home, where a ``cult exiter'' named P.J. (Keitel) is
waiting to wean Ruth from her Indian guru. But as the film moves
from its early mix of rapture and humor into this more serious,
confrontational stage, it runs into trouble. It doesn't help that
Winslet's obvious strength and beauty leave Keitel's P.J. looking
overmatched (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HURRICANE,' starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman
Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Hurricane Carter, a
middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a
triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy ballad of a
movie redeemed by Washington's moving, bone-deep portrayal of the
boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast and loose with
the facts, giving far too much credit to the members of a Canadian
commune who took up Carter's cause and all but eliminating his
heroic co-defendant, John Artis, from the story. And the minor
characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man
heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still
inspiring (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `SCREAM 3,' starring David Arquette, Neve Campbell and Courteney
Cox Arquette. Directed by Wes Craven (R, 116 minutes). At this
point it goes without saying that the ``Scream'' movies are like
episodes of ``Scooby Doo.'' Like the others, ``Scream 3'' belongs
on the Cartoon Network. This time for a better reason: the film is
funny and brisk, with enough good lines to make the comedy more
satisfying than the somewhat routine but still unsettling jolts to
the spine. Craven and his group recognize that the franchise's real
competition is not the recent hit films ``The Blair Witch Project''
or ``The Sixth Sense'' but rather ``Scream'' itself. ``Scream 3''
doesn't skimp on jacked-up scares, but it's as much a personality
show as it is a slasher film (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY,' starring Matt Damon, Jude Law,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written
and directed by Anthony Minghella (R, 135 minutes). There are
diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look in this
glittering thriller. Proving that the brilliance of ``The English
Patient'' was no fluke, Minghella shapes a hypnotic, sensually
charged adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's fascinatingly reptilian
murder story. The traffic-stopping cast includes Damon as the
dangerous chameleon of the title and, in a star-making role, the
English actor Jude Law as a rich dilettante who exerts a homoerotic
magnetism. Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness of a
fine character actress, while Blanchett makes the delirious most of
her role as a needy American post-debutante. As the story's odious
playboy-snob, Hoffman is scene-stealingly wonderful. Gorgeously
photographed in Italy by John Seale (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TITUS,' starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming,
Harry Lennix and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Directed by Julie Taymor (R,
160 minutes). Taymor, the theater director and puppeteer who
created transfixing stage pictures in ``The Lion King'' and ``Juan
Darien,'' has turned Shakespeare's goriest tragedy, ``Titus
Andronicus,'' into a powerful contemplation of murderous revenge
enacted throughout history. Hopkins is ghoulishly funny and tragic
as the title character, whose political stupidity sets in motion a
devastating chain reaction of killing, torture and retaliation.
Lange is Tamora, the captured Goth empress who strikes back.
Although the movie's British theatrical and American film acting
styles don't mesh, Taymor's vision is realized with a shattering
force in time-traveling imagery that blends ancient Rome with
Mussolini's Italy and contemporary cyberpunk flash (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `TOPSY-TURVY,' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent.
Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Leigh's grandly
entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of those films that create a
mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities,
much as ``Shakespeare in Love'' did last year. Instead of a
love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched
personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the
composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing,
frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they
held sway (Maslin).

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Well, Miramax is doing it again. Can no one stop
this?
</P>
<P>
   The little-independent-that-could, now an independent-minded cog
in the Disney empire, has dominated the Academy Awards for a
half-dozen years or so, with best-picture Oscars in 1997 for ``The
English Patient'' and in 1999 for ``Shakespeare in Love.'' In this
year's tight race, with no film dominating the proceedings and no
clear favorite in any major category, it was always assumed that
one or two dark horses could emerge in the nominations, announced
on Tuesday. But very few expected that Miramax's ``Cider House
Rules'' would not only get a best-picture nomination but would also
be tied for second (with Michael Mann's ``Insider'') in total
nominations, seven. ``Cider House,'' playing on only about 800
screens at the moment and just beginning its wide theatrical run,
now stands to capitalize on the momentum of the nominations and
could suddenly become a serious contender for best picture as well
(although the top nomination-getter, ``American Beauty,'' with
eight, remains the narrow betting favorite in Hollywood).
</P>
<P>
   Miramax has drawn criticism in previous years for its aggressive
Oscar tactics, with some studio executives grousing that it was
buying gold statuettes with expensive ad campaigns and plentiful
screenings for academy voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miramax, I think everyone agrees, has taken the lead in how to
market a film to the academy,'' said John Ketcham, a producer of
``The Hurricane,'' which many expected to do very well in this
week's nominations but came away with only one, for Denzel
Washington's lead performance.
</P>
<P>
   But Miramax executives contend that the film, not their
campaign, carried the day. And the creative forces behind ``The
Cider House Rules,'' almost giddy with delight over the unexpected
shower of nominations, were also eager to connect the strong
showing to the way the film has played to audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen people watch the movie, and I've seen people get
emotional about it, and that's all anyone could wish for,'' said
Richard N. Gladstein, the film's producer. ``Actually, this is more
than anyone could wish for.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did ``Cider House'' do so well, while ``The Hurricane''
didn't? Many in Hollywood were attributing the latter film's poor
showing to charges that the movie had misrepresented crucial facts
in telling what is billed as a true story, a charge that the
director, Norman Jewison (an academy favorite who was not nominated
on Tuesday, as many had expected), and the producers vehemently
deny. ``I think the academy is a fickle group,'' Ketcham said.
``They picked films they thought were better. I'm not going to say
they made wrong choices or blame it on the controversy. It may have
hurt us, it may not have. Everybody is welcome to their opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time ``Hurricane'' was embroiled in controversy,
``Cider House'' was ducking one. The film, which on one level is an
argument for abortion rights, has somehow managed to escape being
dragged into the presidential race. John Irving, who wrote the
novel on which it is based as well as the screenplay, half-jokingly
said he wouldn't mind a little controversy if it meant drawing more
people into theaters to see the film. ``Now that Gary Bauer is out
of a job,'' Irving said, referring to the conservative candidate's
withdrawal from the Republican presidential race, ``I think it
would be great if he saw the film and attacked it.'' Something
Different
</P>
<P>
   Richard Farnsworth admits it: he was up at the crack of dawn on
his 60-acre ranch in Billy the Kid country, up along Bonita Creek
at the foot of the Mescalero Apache reservation in New Mexico. ``We
were watching the Oscar nominations on the TV,'' he said. ``Heard
the whole thing, then somebody called right after.''
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth, a veteran stunt man who says he's semiretired from a
belated acting career, was nominated for best actor for his
performance in ``The Straight Story,'' David Lynch's subtle saga of
an elderly man who drives a lawnmower across two states to visit
his estranged brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm 80 years old in a couple of months,'' Farnsworth
said. ``So I'm quite excited about all of this.'' Extraordinarily
soft-spoken, with liquid blue eyes and a sprawl of white hair,
Farnsworth said he had seen only one David Lynch movie before
accepting the role (``It was `Elephant Man,' way back when, many
years ago'') and was aware that the director was known for darker,
more disturbing fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were about four days into shooting it, and I think we knew
we had something really different,'' the actor said. ``We didn't
know what, exactly, but the crew was getting really excited. When
you've been at this as long as I have, you know that when the crew
gets excited, you must have something.''
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth said he would attend the Oscar ceremonies on March
26. He's looking forward to it. But even more, he's looking forward
to a hip replacement operation in a few weeks. ``I'm on one cane at
the moment, unlike the fellow in the movie, who was on two,'' he
said. ``But after the operation, then I'll be able to go out riding
horses again.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconciliation
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Friedman said the most intense moment for him this week
came at the end of the first Berlin Film Festival screening of
``Paragraph 175,'' the documentary he made with Rob Epstein about
Nazi persecution of homosexuals. An elderly Alsatian man, Pierre
Seel, who bitterly describes his concentration camp experiences in
the film, walked onto the stage. It was a particularly emotional
moment because in the film Seel had said he would never forgive the
German people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made this great, long speech, and there was so much
applause, it was a real moment of reconciliation,'' Friedman said.
``The place erupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman and Epstein, who also made the ``The Celluloid
Closet,'' a documentary about homosexuals and the movies, have
already struck a deal for ``Paragraph 175'' _ named for the portion
of the German legal code that allowed persecution of gays _ to be
released at the Film Forum in Manhattan in September. And they say
they are still working, with the full cooperation of HBO, which
financed the film, to secure theatrical showings.
</P>
<P>
   They had made ``Paragraph 175'' without German financing. So
they were a little worried about the reception they might get in
Berlin. (The film had already been screened, to much acclaim, at
the recent Sundance Film Festival in Utah). The reaction was
generally positive, they said, although some complained that
Americans, not Germans, had made the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our response is that there are many films to be made; this one
was ours,'' Epstein said. ``It did feel like we'd struck a nerve,
though.''

 &HT;    THE 'OTHER CHOLESTEROL' LINKED TO HEART DISEASE
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Within a few years, scientists say they will know
whether a naturally occurring human protein they could not even
measure a decade ago is causing as many as 50,000 heart disease
deaths every year among Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The substance is homocysteine, and studies indicate that between
30 and 40 percent of heart disease victims have elevated levels of
it in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, hundreds of researchers in the United States and
other countries are scrambling to determine whether homocysteine is
responsible for those cases of the disease or is simply a
``marker'' that coincides with the disease but does not cause it.
</P>
<P>
   If homocysteine, also linked to stroke and even Alzheimer's
disease, is found to be responsible for the diseases, there is a
simple and inexpensive treatment: folic acid and other B vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will know in three to five years,'' pioneer homocysteine
researcher Rene Malinow said Thursday at the annual meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two important questions that need answers,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   _ Should blood tests be performed on everyone to see if they
have elevated levels of the substance?
</P>
<P>
   _ If a person has an elevated level, should that person be
treated with vitamins?
</P>
<P>
   Malinow said between 15 and 20 clinical trials, involving more
than 200,000 patients, are under way to determine whether the
incidence of coronary heart disease goes down after vitamin
treatments lower homocysteine levels.
</P>
<P>
   Malinow, Cleveland Clinic cell biologist Donald W. Jacobsen and
Aleksandar Rajkovic of Baylor College of Medicine will lead a
symposium Friday on whether a growing understanding of homocysteine
will fundamentally change public health policy and medical
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires certain
food manufacturers, especially bakers and millers, to supplement
their products with folic acid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 260 million people in the United States involved in a
huge experiment,'' Malinow said. ``We may already have started
having a significant impact on these diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen said a Harvard University researcher studying a rare
genetic condition that leaves some people unable to rid their
bloodstreams of homocysteine noted in the 1960s that these people
had an increased risk of coronary heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   However, the researcher's suggestion that the protein might be
responsible could not tested until the 1980s, when the Cleveland
Clinic and other research centers developed ways of testing for it.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen said homocysteine may cause deterioration of veins and
arteries because it is toxic to other substances in the cells.
</P>
<P>
   It also leads to the development of hydrogen peroxide in cells,
he said, and hydrogen peroxide breaks down into superoxide and
hydroxyl, two highly reactive free radicals.

McCAIN BATTLING TO WHIP GOP INTO LINE 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ John McCain's ``national crusade,'' as he
grandly styles his campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination, is a multifront battle that seeks more than just
capturing the White House.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is fighting not only George W. Bush but also the regular
order within their party. The Arizona senator sometimes spells it
out plainly for audiences: ``There's no doubt what we're trying to
do is bring about a new Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign represents the clearest threat to the
Republican establishment, including the party hierarchy and GOP
leadership in Congress, in a quarter century. Not since Ronald
Reagan challenged President Ford for the Republican nomination in
1976 has the party's institutional power structure come under such
a sustained attack from within.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts see McCain making a virtue of a necessity as he
assumes a war footing against his party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no choice,'' said Stephen Wayne of Georgetown
University in Washington. ``All of the establishment is with
Bush.'' A majority of Republican governors, senators and members of
the U.S. House have endorsed the Texas governor. But McCain's
message is still alluring for nascent reformers who have joined his
effort, such as Knox White, mayor of Greenville, S.C. In endorsing
the senator, White called for a house-cleaning after eight years of
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this means shaking up the political establishment, then so
be it,'' White said. ``I think it needs a shaking up.''
</P>
<P>
   In almost every campaign speech, McCain calls for breaking ``the
iron triangle'' of Washington, which he identifies as lobbyists,
money and legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Congress is in the grip of the special interests,'' McCain
says. His campaign, the senator contends, is ``all about getting
the government out of the hand of the special interests and back to
you'' through overhaul of campaign-finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would ban the unlimited and unregulated contributions
that individuals and political action committees, usually
representing corporations or unions, can pour into the parties _
so-called ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush contends McCain's major campaign-finance proposal,
co-sponsored with Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisc., would leave
Republicans vulnerable because it would still allow labor
organizations to use dues in political campaigns without explicit
permission from union members. McCain says he could back such a
plan if corporations also had to get permission from individual
stockholders before making ``soft money'' contributions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's proposal puts him on a collision course, should he be
elected president, with virtually every element of the party and
its funding base.
</P>
<P>
   The senator relishes the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, I'm proud, I'm proud, I'm proud that anyone would
flock to our banner because our banner really is all about the
future of America,'' McCain said Thursday at a VFW hall in
Spartanburg, S.C. ``And it's about the future of my Republican
Party because my Republican Party, to some degree, has lost its
way. I want it to be a reform party. I want to be a party that's an
inclusive party.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown's Wayne said the Republican establishment has ``every
reason to be worried'' by the prospect of a McCain presidency.
``He's unpredictable. He doesn't take orders. He gives orders.''
</P>
<P>
   In long bus rides across the South Carolina countryside between
campaign stops, the senator has held forth on what a McCain
presidency would mean for GOP powerbrokers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though McCain claims to have ``very cordial'' relations
with Republican leaders, such as House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, he said they would have to change their method of
operation if he is elected and his reforms enacted.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked if McCain expected DeLay to give up his
close relationship with business lobbyists, who then direct big
campaign donations to Republican campaign committees, the senator
was unambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can have a lot to do with them, but he can't have the kind
of money that's the mother's milk of his whole operation,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that McCain can run the moneychangers out of the
political temple amuses some analysts. Merle Black, a political
scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, said the notion is ``so
ludicrous it's just unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain has been in Congress almost 17 years and is
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he likes to picture
himself as a maverick outsider, a classic pose for a national
candidate who lacks much establishment backing.
</P>
<P>
   The insider-outsider split is nothing new in a contest for the
Republican presidential nomination, most recently in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan insurgency failed that year but triumphed four years
later as the former movie actor and California governor won the
nomination and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The split is not unknown in the Democratic Party, when John
Kennedy, an outsider in the Senate, took the 1960 nomination from
consummate insider Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had these tensions for quite a while,'' Wayne said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his fight against money in politics, McCain
lashes out against other standard operating procedures in
Washington, including what he sees as the venality of some
congressional chairmen and leaders.
</P>
<P>
   McCain regularly rails against military weapons systems, which
the Pentagon says it does not need but which are products of
congressmen's home states. A favorite target is a helicopter
carrier ship built near the Mississippi home of Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's critics contend that's pretty rich from a man who has
prospered under the system and is chairman of a committee that has
jurisdiction over virtually every industrial enterprise in the
nation. McCain regularly taps many of those interests for Senate
campaign contributions, some of which he rolled over into his
presidential campaign account.
</P>
<P>
   The senator is undaunted, arguing ``everybody but the old bulls
... would say, `Thank God''' if the system is reformed.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is regularly disdainful of congressional intentions. When
telling a meeting of the American Association of Retired Persons to
be wary of promises that Social Security revenues will be
safeguarded, he sounded this alarm: ``Lock boxes get picked by
master thieves, and Congress is full of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Were McCain to make it to the White House, he would undoubtedly
have his strong partisans out in the country. But whether the
nation would have the same feeling for _ and would politicians have
the same fear of _ McCain as they did regarding Reagan in the early
1980s remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his supporters have formed an intense bond with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But whether that could translate into whipping Congress _ or
even the party _ into line is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing he can do about the Republicans'' already in
Congress ``anymore than Clinton could do anything about the
Democrats,'' Wayne said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sees it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elections have a powerful effect on politicians,'' he said.
``We wouldn't have a big problem controlling Republicans on Capitol
Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   But it likely would be, as McCain calls his campaign, ``a wild
ride.''

 &HT;    Bush, McCain similar on issues
 &HT;    By Jena Heath and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _They don't walk alike. They don't talk alike.
But get past the style to the substance and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain think a lot alike, at least more
so than their TV ads suggest.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of some key issues and a look at their respective
tenures in office show that their biggest difference is in style _
and that may matter most as the two battle for victory in
Saturday's key South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not huge differences,'' said John Zogby, a
nonpartisan pollster who said his surveys show that voters are
going on gut when it comes to evaluating the two candidates. ``Both
are pro-life. Both are in favor of a tax cut. Both represent maybe
different rungs on the ladder of Republican orthodoxy. ...The
biggest issues are the images and biographies of the two
candidates. ... The real issues come down to style, image.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain hold similar or identical positions on key
issues. They both oppose abortion except in cases of rape, incest
or danger to the woman's life. Neither would make opposition to
abortion a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees. Both support the
North American Free Trade Agreement and want to see China admitted
to the World Trade Organization. Neither has put forth environment
or health care proposals as detailed as those advanced by Vice
President Al Gore or U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Both men say the citizens of South Carolina should decide
whether to keep flying the Confederate flag over the Statehouse _
not a national issue but an explosive one in the Palmetto State.
</P>
<P>
   Their similarities have left the two Republicans scrambling to
prove how different they are from each other. In tax-averse New
Hampshire, the battle was over tax cuts, with Bush pushing a
five-year, $483 billion plan. McCain, meanwhile, pitched a tax cut
half that size, arguing that it would do more to preserve Social
Security and shore up Medicare. McCain beat Bush by double digits.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Bush is marrying his new, reformer image with
the kind of anti-abortion, pro-God rhetoric that appeals to the
conservative GOP voters he will need on election day. Earlier this
week, he unveiled a campaign funding reform plan, much of it around
since last summer, that resembles McCain's with a key exception _
it would not limit soft money contributions from individuals.
</P>
<P>
   William Connelly, a political scientist at Washington &AMP; Lee
University, said the candidates' differences on campaign finance
reform are a powerful symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``In-kind contributions, soft money, these things make the
American people's eyes glaze over,'' Connelly said. ``I don't think
the arcana of campaign finance reform is really the issue. ...
McCain is the unClinton, the authentic, clean man of principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland, D-Georgia, backs Vice President Al Gore for
the White House, but he, too, admires McCain as a person and
politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is a Republican conservative, but he is a reformer when
it comes to making the government work and when it comes to
campaign finance reform and tobacco,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tennessee, said McCain and Bush have
similar beliefs on issues. Where they differ is in style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think personal characteristics are more important than ever
before,'' Thompson said. ``After the last seven years people
</P>
<P>
   are looking for someone they can admire, look up to. People look
at John and see him as a chance to do something _ that is the core
</P>
<P>
   of his appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, Bush's point-man on Capitol Hill, said that
it is not just McCain's temper and personality that disturb him
about McCain _ it's the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a number of large issues, he simply is not in step with his
own party,'' Coverdell said. Specifically, he said McCain looks
more like Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts on
campaign finance reform and like Sen. John Kerrey, also a Democrat
from Massachusetts, in his quest to regulate tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's Senate supporters solidly back their man despite his
similarity with Bush on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it interesting that the Republican Party establishment
that chose Bush as the knighted one has ignored the experience of
John McCain,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican. ``On
basic Republican issues, I see no difference between the two.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are fault lines, and they are showing in not-so-subtle
ways. Bush is getting help from tobacco and anti-abortion groups,
which are running radio ads against McCain in South Carolina.
McCain drew the ire of the tobacco industry when, in 1998, he tried
to usher a tobacco bill through the Senate that would have raised
taxes by more than $1 a pack. Groups opposed to abortion have
attacked him for reversing his opposition to fetal tissue research
in 1992 after a friend died of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that neither man cleaves to the far right wing of
the Republican party, said Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist at
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either one of them is a classic idealogue like
Jesse Helms is, like Gary Bauer is, like Alan Keyes is,'' he said.
``They both ... take standard party positions ... but I don't
believe that this stuff burns near their heart in the same fervent
way it does standard ideologues. The big differences between them
have to do with iconoclasm versus conventionality.''

REFORMERS AND OLD GUARD VIE IN IRAN'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ At the age of 19, Abdi Manoumshah found himself
at the epicenter of revolution. An Iranian army officer, he was on
guard duty outside the U.S. Embassy in the fall of 1979 when
student firebrands seized what they called the ``nest of spies''
and took U.S. diplomats hostage. Loyal to the new Islamic Republic,
he stepped aside.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, he has fought in the war with Iraq,
abandoned a law practice because it could not provide for his
family, and tried to sustain the hopes kindled in those heady days
when the powerful were humbled by the powerless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the revolution would change things, but in a
different direction, not where we have ended up,'' said Manoumshah,
a pensive man of 40 who runs a tiny three-table restaurant shop
near Tehran's central bazaar. ``We wanted freedom to think and act
as we liked. That is very much what people are asking for now.''
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary elections on Friday have emerged as a
referendum to define just whose ideals were at the heart of the
Iranian revolution 21 years ago. The vote has become, as well, a
popularity poll for President Mohammad Khatami, the reformist
theologian who was swept into office in 1997 but has yet to realize
much of his liberal social agenda or achieve his stated goal of
improved relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For Iranians like Manoumshah, who is a Khatami supporter, the
election for the parliament, or Majlis, is a way to release the
religious monopoly's brakes on everything from a free-market
economy to a free press. ``If the president has the Majlis behind
him, nothing can stop him,'' he said. ``And if he can achieve just
50 percent of what he has talked about, he will be a great
success.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Old Guard that has resisted all reconciliation with the
West and Western culture remains a powerful force. It lost the
presidential election two and a half years ago, but has not lost
power _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's promises to open Iranian society have already alarmed
those right-wing forces, which include elements in the security
forces blamed for killing several reformers last year, the
state-sponsored vigilante groups that attacked student
demonstrators last summer and the conservative clerics who have
closed down a succession of independent newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election of President Khatami opened a vista, and from
that time on, people started to criticize the system more
objectively,'' said Hermezans Vavand, a professor of international
relations at Tehran University. ``The conservative movement then
hardened its positions and reacted with violence toward anyone who
was critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a great number of them are time-servers and
opportunistic,'' he added. ``They might end up getting on the
bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Whichever ideological faction wins control of parliament, it
will face the same mundane problems that have dogged Iran for
years. Its economy has not grown fast enough to keep up with its
ballooning population growth, with unemployment and poverty on the
rise. Nearly 38 percent of its population is 15 or younger, a group
that will also strain the job market. Much of Iran's production,
meanwhile, is in the hands of secretive religious foundations that
pay minimal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has proposed widespread privatization of industries that
were nationalized after the revolution, and he has had some success
in pushing his economic plans through parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the Majlis has been fairly cooperative with him,''
said Ardavazd Baghoomian, who has served in parliament for 16 years
in one of two guaranteed seats allotted to the country's 200,000
ethnic Armenians. ``But if Khatami had a majority, he might have
been able to push through more fundamental changes.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the political factions vying for seats in parliament
have talked about an economic plan, either for or against
Khatami's. But the reformers have said they want to open the way
for a frank, even impertinent public debate on all matters of
public policy.
</P>
<P>
   They have talked of reforming the court system, encouraging the
formation of a range of political parties, and openly permitting
satellite dishes and other elements of foreign culture that are
officially prohibited but widely embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the powers of parliament are limited, although in many
ways untested. It approves and can also impeach ministers. It
approves the budget and economic policy. But no law is enacted
unless it is also affirmed by the 12-member Council of Guardians,
experts in Islamic law who have acted as a reactionary damper on
change.
</P>
<P>
   But a victory for the reformers in parliament could upset even
this venerable institution of the religious right wing. While half
of the council's members are appointed by the supreme leader, the
other six are selected by parliament itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reforms will be done slowly, step by step,'' said Mohammad
Reza Khatami, the brother of the president and one of the reform
candidates for the parliament in Tehran. ``It's hard to say now in
what order they would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The one-week election campaign has skirted some of the more
volatile issues that many Iranians avidly discuss in private,
particularly the constitution designed by the revolutionary leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that assigns ultimate authority over
religious matters, foreign policy, security and much of the
judiciary to a nonelected supreme leader. The current leader is
Ayatollah Ali Khameini, who has condemned liberals, although not
the president, as the agents of evil foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns of all factions have dealt with generalities:
helping young people, improving the economy, upholding Islam. Many
candidates have also tried to capitalize on Khatami's image as an
intellectual and a good-natured man, unlike the stern ayatollahs of
the revolution whose pictures adorn buildings all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian news agency IRNA reported this week that 12
candidates in the northern Iranian city of Meshed were arrested on
charges of election fraud because their campaign materials
understated their true ages.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and parliament
speaker, has also tried to present a kinder face. He sent flyers to
more than 2 million households in Tehran that show him bareheaded,
without his black clerical turban, lounging in a garden with a
little boy. ``I will stay with you in winter and deliver you to the
spring,'' the leaflet said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even the conservatives have flung around the word ``freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problems with the idea of freedom,'' said Mohammad
Reza Bahonar, a member of the current Parliament and a key
strategist for the conservative faction. ``Our main slogans during
the revolution were independence, freedom and an Islamic republic.
After all, God created people as free beings.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani has become a pivotal figure in the campaign because
he has been endorsed by several conservative factions even as the
reformers vilify him as a man with no ideals. To many ordinary
Iranians, however, he represents stability and a familiar face for
a transitional time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of this right-left fight, which is really
among the clergy and not relevant to the general public,'' said
Sohrab Alizadeh, who is running a lonely and underfinanced race as
an independent environmentalist in Tehran. ``But Rafsanjani has
been in power since the revolution, so in a way people feel like he
has to be kept in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 38 million Iranians are eligible to vote, and
strategists in several parties have said a high turnout will favor
the reform candidates, as it did Khatami in his presidential race.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government first announced that the ballots from 36,000
polling stations across the country would be counted by computer,
but the clerical body that oversees the elections said late this
week that they would be counted by hand. Strategists for several
parties said the final count may not be known for at least a week.
</P>
<P>
   Some 6,000 people are running for the 290 seats, although the
exact number was not known Thursday because hundreds of candidates
dropped out during the campaign week. And the day before the
campaign began, a council of clerics dropped 777 candidates from
the ballot, citing their views on the relationship between religion
and government. Still, with so many candidates _ up to 100 for each
seat in some districts _ pinpointing their positions based on their
backgrounds has been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Those running as pro-Khatami candidates or making speeches in
their support include former government officials forced out of
office for espousing a free press; a film director who hopes that
economic reform will revitalize the struggling Iranian cinema; a
cleric whose job is to safeguard Khomeini's writings; a
post-revolution intelligence chief; a writer who led the student
hostage-takers in 1979; and a number of high-ranking religious
figures.
</P>
<P>
   No one exemplifies this jumble of pedigrees better than Zahra
Eshraghi, a 37-year-old employee of the Ministry of Interior. She
is married to the president's brother and has campaigned with him.
She is also the granddaughter of Khomeini, known as the Imam and
the virulently anti-Western hero of the revolution and founder of
the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important is that if the reformers win, there will be
a good balance between the Majlis and the government,'' Eshraghi
said. ``We have had a Majlis that was very monotone, with all the
same kind of people. We should have a Majlis that is in keeping
with the times.''
</P>
<P>
   She has campaigned for her husband and the reform list of
candidates and said her grandfather would approve of her husband's
bid, just as he had encouraged her to marry into the Khatami
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of President Khatami,'' she said, ``is the same
as the governments of the period of the Imam. The Imam himself had
a high degree of trust for Khatami.''

NORRIS COLUMN: WHAT ARE THOSE BOND BUYERS SMOKING? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market is worried that Philip Morris _ under attack
from all sides _ is going to die. The bond market is quite
unconcerned. Somebody is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   So the question for today is: Will Big Tobacco go bankrupt? Will
those who despise it _ a crowd that includes a growing number of
lawyers and politicians, not to mention some former customers who
are dying of cancer _ manage to drive the companies into the
ground?
</P>
<P>
   The stock market clearly is worried. You have to go back decades
to find big stocks that are as cheap as Philip Morris and R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco are now. Both trade for around five times profits.
The dividend yield on Reynolds stock is over 15 percent, while that
on Morris is about 10 percent. If Philip Morris' very profitable
tobacco business somehow vanished overnight, leaving it with only
the profits from its other operations, including Miller beer and
Kraft foods, the stock would no doubt rally significantly.
</P>
<P>
   The big risk is not the latest crop of suits, from tobacco
farmers and cigarette wholesalers claiming price fixing, but from a
pending Florida class action filed by smokers. There is talk of a
punitive damage award of $100 billion or more within a couple of
months.
</P>
<P>
   And yet over on the bond market, a Philip Morris bond that
matures in 2027 is trading at a yield of 8.5 percent. That's a
couple of percentage points more than the yield on similar Treasury
bonds, but it's far below the rate you'd expect if default was
deemed likely.
</P>
<P>
   That split opinion reflects the differing realities of the
cigarette business. Cash flows remain strong, in part because
addicted customers are loyal customers. But the class action
lawyers are circling, and the stocks keep falling.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to measure just how much investors fear bankruptcy
is the way the two Nabisco stocks trade. One, Nabisco Holdings, is
a pure play on Nabisco, maker of Oreos and Ritz Crackers. The
other, Nabisco Group Holdings, is the same thing. But it may have
some residual liability if R.J. Reynolds is driven into bankruptcy,
because it is a former parent of Reynolds. Nabisco Group now sells
at a 50 percent discount _ up from 21 percent last summer _
reflecting nothing but the fear of a Reynolds bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   In the cloud of litigation, it is easy to forget that cigarettes
are here to stay. Largely because of payments under the industry's
settlement with the states, cigarette prices rose 32 percent last
year, but the number of cigarettes sold fell just 8 percent.
Prohibition wouldn't work, and while education about the risks has
cut smoking _ per capita consumption is half what it was 40 years
ago _ those who smoke now do so despite both scorn from others and
a knowledge of the risks. If Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds were
driven into bankruptcy, their shareholders and bondholders might be
wiped out, but the companies would be reorganized and keep selling
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   If you accept that, there is no particular public interest to be
served by bankrupting the companies. To the contrary, it is in the
interests of the states to keep the companies in business and able
to make settlement payments.
</P>
<P>
   Those buying tobacco stocks now are placing a reasonable bet
that the companies will survive, and that the legal cloud will
eventually dissipate. It is a risky _ but probably very profitable
_ investment. Those buying Philip Morris bonds, on the other hand,
are taking virtually the same risk, but with a far smaller reward
if they are right.
</P>
<P>
   It sort of makes you wonder what the bond buyers are smoking.

 &HT;    Emery pilots warned of safety problems
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney and Wes Hills
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _Wednesday's fatal crash in California of an Emery
Worldwide Airlines DC-8 en route to Dayton follows more than two
years of safety warnings by Emery pilots, according to internal
records obtained by the Dayton Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The four-engine freighter jet crashed into an auto salvage yard
Wednesday about 13 minutes after taking off at 7:30 p.m. local time
from Mather Field in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The crew was attempting to return to the airport after declaring
an emergency and reporting that the airplane had ``an extreme
center of gravity problem,'' according to the National
Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the accident.
That could mean, among other possible causes, a shift in load,
incorrect cargo weight or mechanical problems, Preston Hicks of the
NTSB said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were trying to locate the plane's flight data
recorder and cockpit voice recorder in the smoking wreckage, Hicks
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, carrying a load of transmission fluid, clothing and a
small packet of detonators for auto air bags, was at 800 feet when
it tried to return for an emergency landing. The airplane, bound
for Emery's air freight hub at Dayton International Airport,
erupted in flames and spread fire across the salvage yard.
</P>
<P>
   All three crewmembers died in the crash. An Emery spokesman
identified them as Capt. Kevin Stables, 43, of Berlin, N.Y.; First
Officer George Land, 35, of Placerville, Calif., and Second officer
Russell Hicks, 38, of Sparks, Nev. No one on the ground was
injured, Emery spokesman Jim Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Emery's first fatal airplane crash. Emery began flying
cargo in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Emery called the DC-8 ``the backbone of
Emery's air cargo fleet. The company has 38 DC-8s in its fleet and
they are a very reliable aircraft for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not determined the cause of the crash, but in
the past two years Emery pilots have complained of improper loading
as a safety concern in both internal ``flight debrief'' reports and
in letters to the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Emery pilots and the company are in the process of negotiating
the pilots' first labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   The identification number on the plane that crashed was N8079U.
In August 1998, the same plane was forced to return to Tampa
International Airport in Florida after one of its engines flamed
out, according to the pilots' flight debrief report on the incident
filed with Emery.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident at Mather Field last May, the plane's
crew became trapped in the cockpit when the cockpit doorknob broke
off, according to the flight debrief report on the incident. The
previous crew had written up the doorknob in the maintenance log,
but a mechanic had written ``cockpit door ops OK,'' the report
said. The flight was delayed for three hours while a contract
mechanic went to a Home Depot store for parts, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The same airplane had problems with cabin pressure and a deicing
system last May, according to a pilot report by Emery Capt. Mark
Luthi. But on Thursday, Luthi said the DC-8 that crashed ``was one
of our better planes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there was ``no way to speculate'' about what caused the
airplane to crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News last June reported that the FAA is
investigating an Emery manager's allegations of numerous violations
of federal hazardous materials regulations, including shipping
hazardous materials without adequate documentation, failing to
notify pilots of hazardous cargo on board their aircraft and
concealing problems from FAA inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Emery's Allen Thursday declined to discuss the pilots' safety
complaints. In a prepared statement given the newspaper late last
year, Emery said the pilots' safety concerns ``are either old news
and have since been reviewed by the FAA, or are presently under
review.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, our safety record speaks for itself,'' said Rocco A.
Sacci, Emery's director of corporate communications. ``The FAA's
looking at us all the time. They're looking at all the airlines all
the time. This is a heavily regulated industry. We are in
compliance with the requirements of the FAA.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Emery pilots have filed reports with the
company about overloaded airplanes, engines quitting on takeoff,
brakes failing on landing, loss of hydraulic pressure in flight
control systems, and broken navigation gear.
</P>
<P>
   The reports also include allegations that maintenance crews
sometimes kept airplanes flying by signing off faulty equipment as
repaired, or repeatedly putting off maintenance on items that
continued to fail in flight. In at least two cases, pilots refused
to fly an airplane after they discovered that repairs had not been
made.
</P>
<P>
   FAA safety managers said they have investigated many of the
pilots' reports, some of which remain under investigation. The
complaints have not resulted in any enforcement actions by the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   However, FAA safety managers last year said the FAA ``is
focused'' on Emery's airline operations.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the agency launched its second major inspection of
Emery Worldwide, known as a ``regional airline safety inspection,''
in less than a year. The second inspection coincides with the
transfer of Emery's airline certificate _ and the responsibility
for inspecting Emery _ from an FAA district office in San Jose,
Calif., to Cincinnati. The FAA is still investigating issues that
arose in last year's inspection, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the incidents still under investigation is one from June
14, 1999. A DC-8 loaded with auto parts at Flint, Mich., ``barely''
got off the ground before reaching the end of the runway, according
to a crew report sent to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting the airplane was heavier than their paperwork said,
the captain increased the airplane's landing speed when it arrived
in Dallas, Texas, according to the report. After landing, the
captain had the cargo weighed and found it to be nearly 7 tons
heavier than stated, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Had the crew used the weight figures ground loaders provided to
calculate their landing speed, the airplane would have descended
too quickly and ``we could have ended up in the approach lights,''
the captain reported.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA safety manager said the agency verified the heavier
weight and is still investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Another in-flight emergency occurred over Dayton's northern
suburbs early on June 13, 1998, when the main cargo door on an
Emery DC-8 flew open just as the airplane was taking off, according
to a report Rachford submitted to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Emery Capt. Thomas G. Rachford reported the airplane resisted
his efforts to raise or lower its nose or turn in either direction.
He also heard a loud roar. Moments later, the Dayton air traffic
control tower told him the jet's main cargo door was ``full open.''
Without awaiting his response, the tower declared an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Rachford tried to return to the airport, but the large cargo
door jutted from the plane's side like a second rudder. As it
turned, the DC-8 swayed and ``made a horrific noise'' as the cargo
door slammed against the plane's upper side, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned the door could rip off and smash into the wing or
tail, Rachford said he landed the airplane as quickly as possible.
Only when the plane touched down did the door-open warning light
come on, according to crew reports. An FAA investigation never
found what caused the door to open.
</P>
<P>
   Rachford, who is also chairman of the Emery pilots' unit of the
Air Line Pilots Association labor union, has been pressing the FAA
to scrutinize Emery more closely.
</P>
<P>
   In a September 1998 letter to a FAA safety manager then in
charge of safety inspections for Emery, Rachford wrote: ``I can't
say it any clearer: This airline is going to put a hole in the
ground and kill someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the pilots' reports last September, FAA safety
managers said they weren't alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it routine, I wouldn't call it particularly
alarming,'' said David Gilliom, Los Angeles-based flight standards
manager for FAA's Western Pacific Region. Gilliom's region included
the San Jose office that oversaw Emery until last December, when
the FAA transferred that responsibility to its Cincinnati district
office.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliom could not be reached for comment Thursday, and a FAA
spokeswoman said the agency would likely not make any additional
comment because of the crash investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Rachford said Emery pilots have had little to show
from their discussions with the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were given a lot of meetings and a lot of opportunity to
talk at a lot of levels, but there has been zero action,'' he said.
``What's it going to take, one of these things going into a
schoolyard?''
</P>
<P>
   Emery Worldwide, a unit of CNF Transportation Inc. with $2.2
billion in revenues last year, is one of the largest U.S. air
carriers specializing in heavyweight freight. Its dramatic growth
in the 1990s made it one of the Dayton area's biggest business
success stories. Its two major Dayton-based operations _ its North
American air freight hub and Emery Worldwide Airlines, its airline
subsidiary _ have swelled its work force to 4,200 from 1,600 in
December 1997. The growth has spurred Dayton to plan for $1.2
billion in airport improvements over the next 20 years.

 &HT;    Emery pilots warned of safety problems
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney and Wes Hills
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _Wednesday's fatal crash in California of an Emery
Worldwide Airlines DC-8 en route to Dayton follows more than two
years of safety warnings by Emery pilots, according to internal
records obtained by the Dayton Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The four-engine freighter jet crashed into an auto salvage yard
Wednesday about 13 minutes after taking off at 7:30 p.m. local time
from Mather Field in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The crew was attempting to return to the airport after declaring
an emergency and reporting that the airplane had ``an extreme
center of gravity problem,'' according to the National
Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the accident.
That could mean, among other possible causes, a shift in load,
incorrect cargo weight or mechanical problems, Preston Hicks of the
NTSB said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were trying to locate the plane's flight data
recorder and cockpit voice recorder in the smoking wreckage, Hicks
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, carrying a load of transmission fluid, clothing and a
small packet of detonators for auto air bags, was at 800 feet when
it tried to return for an emergency landing. The airplane, bound
for Emery's air freight hub at Dayton International Airport,
erupted in flames and spread fire across the salvage yard.
</P>
<P>
   All three crewmembers died in the crash. An Emery spokesman
identified them as Capt. Kevin Stables, 43, of Berlin, N.Y.; First
Officer George Land, 35, of Placerville, Calif., and Second officer
Russell Hicks, 38, of Sparks, Nev. No one on the ground was
injured, Emery spokesman Jim Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Emery's first fatal airplane crash. Emery began flying
cargo in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Emery called the DC-8 ``the backbone of
Emery's air cargo fleet. The company has 38 DC-8s in its fleet and
they are a very reliable aircraft for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not determined the cause of the crash, but in
the past two years Emery pilots have complained of improper loading
as a safety concern in both internal ``flight debrief'' reports and
in letters to the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Emery pilots and the company are in the process of negotiating
the pilots' first labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   The identification number on the plane that crashed was N8079U.
In August 1998, the same plane was forced to return to Tampa
International Airport in Florida after one of its engines flamed
out, according to the pilots' flight debrief report on the incident
filed with Emery.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident at Mather Field last May, the plane's
crew became trapped in the cockpit when the cockpit doorknob broke
off, according to the flight debrief report on the incident. The
previous crew had written up the doorknob in the maintenance log,
but a mechanic had written ``cockpit door ops OK,'' the report
said. The flight was delayed for three hours while a contract
mechanic went to a Home Depot store for parts, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The same airplane had problems with cabin pressure and a deicing
system last May, according to a pilot report by Emery Capt. Mark
Luthi. But on Thursday, Luthi said the DC-8 that crashed ``was one
of our better planes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there was ``no way to speculate'' about what caused the
airplane to crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News last June reported that the FAA is
investigating an Emery manager's allegations of numerous violations
of federal hazardous materials regulations, including shipping
hazardous materials without adequate documentation, failing to
notify pilots of hazardous cargo on board their aircraft and
concealing problems from FAA inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Emery's Allen Thursday declined to discuss the pilots' safety
complaints. In a prepared statement given the newspaper late last

and have since been reviewed by the FAA, or are presently under
review.''

 &HT;    Backstreet Boys come back for more
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine if the St. Louis Rams were so pumped about their Super
Bowl victory that they decided to put their uniforms back on,
return to the Georgia Dome and sell tickets. That's essentially
what's happening Saturday as the nation's hottest concert act, the
stylishly syncopated Backstreet Boys, bring their record-breaking
tour back to Atlanta for yet another sold-out night of pyrotechnics
and pop hits.
</P>
<P>
   Although billed as the ``Into the Millennium Tour,'' the show is
basically the same one the Boys staged at Philips Arena in
November, except with twice as many fans to squeal through the
20-song set. The original allotment of tickets sold out almost
immediately, but additional seats have been put on sale.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who missed the Boys on their last visit, here's
a preview of what's likely to happen when 65,000-plus fans
experience them in the Dome:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The crowd: The seats will be filled mostly by elementary
school children and teenage girls holding teddy bears and green
glow sticks. (A lot of their 30-ish parents will be along, too _
and they secretly know the words to all the hits.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The setup: The concert is ``in the round,'' which means the
stage will be set up in the center of the Dome, allowing the Boys
to point and wink at all four corners. Binoculars are recommended.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Intermission: Comes after a short opening act, about 20
minutes _ plenty of time to purchase items such as a BSB ``Comin'
Atcha'' T-shirt ($19.99), fingernail tattoos ($3.99) or a
millennium pencil ($5.99).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start looking for the BSB when: The lights dim and the theme
from ``Star Wars'' booms through the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  First sighting: After a parade of dancers arrives carrying
lighted poles, look up. The Boys materialize high above the crowd,
suspended near the ceiling. On boogie boards. Really.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Boys: A.J. McLean (22), Nick Carter (20), Brian Littrell
(24), Kevin Richardson (27) and Howie Dorough (26).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Also onstage: Ten dancers and a six-piece band.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most screams: The group's blond cherub, Carter, gets them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most sentimental moment: During a tune called ``The Perfect
Fan,'' the Boys haul five mothers and daughters onstage, dance with
the girls and present a rose to each of the moms.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Words most frequently used in BSB lyrics: ``Body,''
``everybody,'' ``backstreet,'' ``back,'' ``backstreet's back'' and
``sex-yoo-aahll.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The reviews say: The show is Disney meets Motown, with The New
York Times, Newsweek and others giving the Boys high marks for
their professionalism and ability to entertain. In short, they're
winning almost everybody over. Even cynical critics.

 &HT;    Casting an eye on the purposes of `Principle'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 20.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gadflies get around, and no one circulates like Stanley Fish. An
index to any of his books _ but especially ``The Trouble With
Principle'' _ tells you how widely the former chairman of Duke
University's once-notorious English department ranges when he's on
a roll. From a literary critic you expect Jacques Derrida and
Michel Foucault to make their obligatory appearances. But Fish
casts his net wide, and no one acquainted with him is surprised to
find Sam Peckinpah turn up in a disquisition whose serious purposes
extend well beyond ``The Wild Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports, film, TV and radio, politics and journalism _ Fish is
fluent wherever he goes. Had he waited a few months before
publishing ``The Trouble With Principle,'' you could be dead
certain that the place in the index between the names Steven
Rockefeller and Ellen Rooney would be occupied by one John Rocker.
The title of his most recent book was ``There Is No Such Thing as
Free Speech, and It's a Good Thing Too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fish, who first made a name for himself as a Milton scholar,
escaped the ghetto of academic literary criticism several years
ago, turning up in respected law reviews, on the op-ed page of The
New York Times and, now, in the rarefied realm of political theory.
He is where he had been headed all along.
</P>
<P>
   Politics was always at the heart of Fish's criticism _ not party
politics but the subtler politics that underpins the principles we
profess to uphold. His rhetorical style is surgically precise, and
in ``The Trouble With Principle'' it is his best friends who are
put under the knife _ liberals comfortable with beliefs whose
rightness they take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Agile in the art of arguing
</P>
<P>
   Full disclosure: Fish and I once sparred in print a few years
ago _ enjoyably, I thought _ and he subsequently went on to stiffer
competition, debating Dinesh D'Souza on affirmative action and
campus speech codes before college audiences. That he would be
invited to D'Souza's wedding says something about his civility but
also his intellectual penchant for getting about.
</P>
<P>
   In the art of argument, he is formidably skilled if, sometimes,
given to the sophist's sleight of hand. He will unravel your every
position, reducing it to words of reversible meanings, while
resisting a firm stand of his own _ except that free speech is a
hollow concept. As a legal matter, he is of course right, the point
having been made long ago by Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black.
</P>
<P>
   Free speech advocates pay homage to Milton's ``Areopagitica,''
but tolerance had its limits for Milton, too. ``Everyone,'' he
wrote, ``should be allowed to speak and publish, except of course
Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   As statehouse politicians are fond of saying, ``It depends on
whose ox is being gored,'' and Fish understands why all is
relative. He offers, as an example, the shocked reaction of
Westerners to the death sentence conferred on Salman Rushdie for
``The Satanic Verses'':
</P>
<P>
   ``When the novelist Paul Theroux encounters a Pakistani with an
advanced degree in science who nevertheless declares `Rushdie must
die,' Theroux responds in true boutique multiculturalist fashion by
setting him `straight' and informing him (as if he were a child)
that his are `ignorant and barbarous sentiments.' (I bet that
really convinced him.)''
</P>
<P>
   The argument Fish proceeds to make is not that Rushdie deserves
to lose his head, but that multiculturalism _ like free speech, or
abortion rights, or democratic elections _ is a two-way street: We
respect other cultures so long as they do not offend our own. And
the flip side: Freedom of speech is fine when it serves our
purposes, but it cannot be absolute. It is defensible, he might
have said, provided it does not offend. But offend whom?
</P>
<P>
   A critique of liberalism
</P>
<P>
   ``The Trouble With Principle'' is a shrewd, unsparing critique
of liberalism by a man most people assume to be one of them. Where,
Fish asks, ``do I stand on the substantive matters ... abortion,
the death penalty, welfare reform, affirmative action, the line
between church and state, environmental regulation, and so on?
Stephen Macedo (a political scientist) once ventured a guess ...
when he said that Fish is in favor of affirmative action, abortion
rights, and equal treatment of gays and lesbians and he generally
opposes university speech codes. Well, as the great singer Meatloaf
might put it, two out of four ain't so good. I am in favor of
affirmative action and gay and lesbian rights; but I do not support
abortion rights (although what I would support in this vexed area
is not clear to me), and I disfavor speech codes only in those
contexts where the good they do (by my lights) will be outweighed
by the trouble and litigation they produce. ...''
</P>
<P>
   He stands, he means to say, not on principles for their own sake
but for the larger purposes they serve. The problem, in politics,
is that there is no guarantee of agreement on those purposes. To
fall back on the principles that underpin them is to take up
residence in magnificent sand castles.

<P>
   For better or worse, he's as unpredictable and venturesome at
age 67 _ in ``Gertrude and Claudius,'' his slim new novel _ as he
was at 27, when his ``Rabbit, Run'' heralded a great literary
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gertrude and Claudius'' is very clever and elegantly crafted,
but sometimes seems more like a daring academic exercise than a
full-bodied, satisfying read. It's a prequel to ``Hamlet'' in
narrative prose. Peppered with the well-researched sights and
sounds of medieval Denmark _ right down to the feast menu of
brine-injected ham and goose-in-honey _ it tells a fanciful back
story of the forbidden romance between the melancholy prince's
mother and uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare cast them as fleshy sensualists who married hastily
after Claudius murdered Hamlet's father with an earful of poison.
Updike's take, though, is in many ways sympathetic. Perhaps because
of his own guilt (achingly obvious in the Maples stories, for a
start) over leaving his family for the woman who became his second
wife, Updike sees the lusty Danes as much sinned against as
sinning. Thwarted at every turn by a domineering
king-husband-brother, King Hamlet, they stoically fulfilled their
duties and denied their desires as long as they could, and then
fell into a middle-aged affair all the more torrid for its delay.
</P>
<P>
   The peaceful close of the tale is shot through with irony: our
knowledge that Shakespeare's drama _ and its bloody comeuppance for
the lovers _ waits just around the dark bend of the forest trail.
</P>
<P>
   There are interesting, subtle undercurrents here. In the
tradition of Tom Stoppard's play ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are
Dead,'' Updike salutes Shakespeare with one hand _ treating his
fictive world as a real, solid launch pad for his own story. With
the other hand he rips open that classic with new perspectives on
its events, using the recurring image of the hooded falcon to
remind us that each storyteller can only give us his one special
frame.
</P>
<P>
   The book is divided into three sections, each assigning
characters with different names, some from the original Hamlet
story of Norse myth (where Gertrude was called Gerutha, for
example), some from Renaissance versions in German and French. At
first the device seems like a gimmick: showoffy bookishness. But as
the tale goes on, hearing the ever-changing names takes on a
mysterious, dreamlike air, as if we're watching the morphing of
mythic heroes with a thousand faces, in Joseph Campbell's phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, adultery is Updike's rut. He's written
brilliantly on it many, many times, and it feels too narrow a
subject for the breadth of his mind. Needled by critics for this
repetitiveness, Updike responded powerfully with ``In the Beauty of
the Lilies,'' his multigenerational epic of 1996, and, to a lesser
extent, with 1997's ``Toward the End of Time,'' which at least set
its suburban hanky-panky in the eerie aftermath of a nuclear war.
But let's face it, some breathless passages of ``Gertrude'' (``She
would have lain down in warm mud for him, even the mud of the
pigsty, to enter the exaltation she found in his brute love'')
sound like a parody of pulp romance.
</P>
<P>
   Such lapses are outnumbered by flights of ravishing beauty. Here
is Updike on the northern lights: ``Their evasive faint peacock
colors, violet and turquoise, a far-off music of phosphorescence.
They undulated along their vertical folds with a kind of beckoning
motion, fading and returning.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the last third of a passage that no one _ no one
_ could have written in precisely that way except John Updike.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, don't be put off too much by the still-youthful
experiments of this rascally old master. He still writes like an
angel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  FICTION
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude and Claudius. By John Updike. Knopf. $23. 212 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Even in this eccentric prequel to ``Hamlet,''
Updike's dazzling style is intact.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST LOOK
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt from ``Gertrude and Claudius'':
</P>
<P>
   She broke the silence his own had pointedly suggested. ``My
lord?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, my queen? It is late. A king needs to greet the sun as an
equal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you feel guilty?''
</P>
<P>
   She felt his body stiffen, his breathing skip a breath. ``Guilty
concerning what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, what else? _ guilty concerning our, our coming together
while ... Hamlet was my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudius snorted and hugged tighter his accumulating nugget of
fatigue, making their bed of goose down emphatically heave. ``The
old Norse rule is, what you cannot hold is not yours. I took from
him a property he didn't know he owned _ territory he had never
plowed. You were a virgin to unbridled love.''
</P>
<P>
   And, though she felt this was not entirely true, it was true
enough to rest on, and they fell asleep in unison.
</P>

Journal-Constitution, profiled John Updike in 1998.

 &HT;    From blues poets to book authors, three films trace region's
literature
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 20.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If H.L. Mencken were alive to see Ross Spears' documentary film
trilogy on Southern literature, the acerbic journalist surely would
change his mind about the region he described in 1917 as ``the
Sahara of the Bozart.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambasting the South as a ``gargantuan paradise of the
fourth-rate,'' Mencken observed: ``Once you have counted James
Branch Cabell you will not find a single Southern prose writer who
can actually write.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments were mostly true in 1917, Spears says, but
shortly after World War I the South underwent an amazing literary
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Spears' three 80-minute films trace this resurgence and bring to
life William Faulkner's famous line, ``The past is never dead, it
isn't even past,'' through an effective use of narration, author
interviews, archival photographs, dramatic re-creations, and the
writers' own words. Former U.S. poet laureate Rita Dove's narration
connects the accounts of individual writers.
</P>
<P>
   The first film in the ``Tell About the South'' series covers
1915 to 1940 and includes segments on Jean Toomer, the Vanderbilt
poets, the Mississippi Delta blues poets/singers, Zora Neale
</P>
<P>
   Hurston, Thomas Wolfe, Margaret Mitchell, Erskine Caldwell and
others. Blues composers such as Robert Johnson were included
because, as novelist Shelby Foote says in the film, the blues is
``real poetry. It has terrific emotion to it.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparing the blues poets to the Fugitive poets of
Vanderbilt, Spears emphasizes his point that Southern literature
was a partnership of blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Fugitive poets epitomized the cutting edge of high art,
the blues poets raised African-American folklife to the level of
genius,'' Dove notes in the film. ``Two rich cultures on parallel
tracks, often hidden from one another, but never completely out of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   The second film, ``Prophets and Poets,'' tells the stories of
Richard Wright, Eudora Welty, Robert Penn Warren, Flannery
O'Connor, Ralph Ellison and other writers in the 1941-1962 period.
And the third film, ``Let Freedom Ring,'' covers 1963 to the
present and includes interviews with Alice Walker, William Styron,
Ernest Gaines, Reynolds Price, Pat Conroy, Lee Smith and others.
</P>
<P>
   Recently completed, ``Let Freedom Ring'' will have its world
premiere Saturday at a screening of the trilogy at the Rialto
Center for the Performing Arts. Plans are to air all three parts of
the series on PBS stations late this year or early in 2001, Spears
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite an undertaking,'' says Spears, whose 1980
documentary on author James Agee is the only film biography of an
American writer nominated for an Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   Spears and company began working on the project, funded
primarily by the National Endowment for the Humanities, in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first things we did,'' Spears says, ``was assemble
a fine group of consultants, including Louis Rubin, Robert Coles
and Henry Louis Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was a matter of convincing some of the more
reclusive writers to agree to on-camera interviews. Cormac McCarthy
turned them down, as did John Grisham. Alice Walker consented only
after two years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people we interviewed have died,'' Spears says,
``including Cleanth Brooks, Margaret Walker, Willie Morris and
Andrew Lytle. We were fortunate to be able to talk with them when
we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The next challenge was creating a visually interesting film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to use a lot of their own words, of course, and I
tried to find the right voice to speak those words by listening to
people audition. These were relatively unknown readers, but their
voices combined with the words of the writer to evoke the
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears also used dramatizations from some of the works to create
matching images. ``We did that with Zora Neale Hurston and Jean
Toomer. And with Flannery O'Connor, we used stills that looked like
her characters.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Spears' goals was to show how Southern literature was
really an African-American and European-American creation. ``I
tried to stress that in each of the three parts by pairing a black
writer and a white writer. Each presented a portrait of the
20th-century South from somewhat different angles.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to comparing the Fugitive poets and the blues poets
in Part 1, Spears pairs Thomas Wolfe and Zora Neale Hurston because
they had much in common. Both were larger-than-life characters,
they were born around the same time, both moved to New York, and
both went back to their roots in order to create their work.
</P>
<P>
   If there was ever a genius, Alice Walker says in the film,
Hurston was it. ``She came out of Florida with one dress and one
pair of shoes, and created this whole world, which is not there
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Prophets and Poets,'' Spears compares Robert Penn Warren
and Ralph Ellison ``because both were Southerners who moved to the
North and became friends. Both were highly intellectual, well-read,
extremely ambitious men of letters. Each is known for one big, big
novel.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Let Freedom Ring,'' William Styron is juxtaposed with
Ernest Gaines to highlight the differences and similarities in
their lives and the way their careers evolved. Styron's father was
a slave owner, and Gaines' father was a slave.
</P>
<P>
   The first two films have garnered a number of positive reviews.
Lewis Simpson, emeritus editor of the prestigious Southern Review,
praised ``Tell About the South'' as ``a great story about a
remarkable group of storytellers told by another remarkable
storyteller.''
</P>
<P>
   And, at Georgia State University, Faulkner scholar Thomas L.
McHaney lauded the film as a ``unique history of the great
literature of the South not only because it makes so many voices
visible, but it lets us see and hear the writers and then the
writers who talk about the writers. It's unique because it presents
together, better than any book I know, more of the great Southern
voices, black and white, that made and remade the literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was reluctant to tackle such a complex project at
first, Spears acknowledges that it was an ideal project for him. A
native of Tennessee, Spears has maintained an interest in Southern
literature ever since his days as a student of Reynolds Price's at
Duke University. After graduating from film schools in North
Carolina and California, Spears produced a documentary in 1979 on
the life and work of his favorite writer, James Agee. Other films
followed on the Civil War, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and one
family living in poverty in America.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hollywood directors, documentary filmmakers don't make a
lot of money, Spears says. ``I operate on grants and I pay myself a
salary, but mostly it's a labor of love.''
</P>
<P>
   This project should have a larger audience than his other films,
Spears says, because he is marketing the films, along with study
guides, to colleges. ``We've never done this before, but it looks
like they're really going to be useful.''
</P>
<P>
   His main purpose, he adds, is spreading the word about the South
and its writers. And, despite the increased homogenization of the
region, Spears and the scholars he interviewed predict a bright
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus is that the South is still a very distinctive
region and there are many great Southern writers out there. I'm not
sure there's anybody on the level of Faulkner, but maybe there is.
Time will tell.''

 &HT;    Jacksonville Symphony sets big anniversary fest
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb.20
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra, a golden anniversary
means a golden opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   A regional orchestra that serves North Florida and the ``First
Coast'' _ so called because it's where Juan Ponce de Leon landed in
1513 _ the JSO is serving up a 50th-anniversary festival that
outshines what a lot of major musical ensembles do for significant
dates.
</P>
<P>
   Between Tuesday and March 5, travelers to the city can partake
of a banquet of concerts by the JSO and visiting ensembles,
including the Minnesota Orchestra (Thursday-Friday) in a first-ever
visit to the area by a major symphony. Those same days, on street
corners and in workplaces and schools throughout the city, JSO
musicians in small ensembles will offer a series of informal
chamber concerts dubbed ``Art Attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The JSO has an acclaimed American composer, 1998 Pulitzer Prize
winner Aaron Jay Kernis, in residence during the festival, and his
work will be featured in two programs. Kernis is also the judge of
a Florida composers' competition called ``Fresh Ink,'' and those
who wonder how he'll come to terms with untried music can watch the
process at open rehearsals of the orchestra Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The capstone of the first week will be a reunion concert Sunday
of JSO music directors and musicians. The new music director,
Brazilian conductor Fabio Mechetti, who took over the podium in
time for the golden-anniversary year, will play host to
predecessors Roger Nierenberg and Willis Page, and some 30 former
players are expected to return.
</P>
<P>
   The second week offers the lively show ``Swingtime!'' (March 3).
The JSO's showcase concert is March 4, a performance of Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony. And the festival ends with show biz on March 5: a
concert of ``50 Great Years of Music and Movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Above and beyond the music, another reason to check out the
festival is the chance to experience music in the 2-year-old,
1,800-seat, $33 million Robert E. Jacoby Symphony Hall in the
Times-Union Center for the Performing Arts. One of the few U.S.
performance spaces dedicated to orchestra music, Jacoby Hall was
acoustically designed by R. Lawrence Kirkegaard of Chicago. He's
the acoustical consultant who advised the ASO on its plan last
summer to build a new concert hall, which ultimately failed because
of fund-raising problems.
</P>
<P>
   Many at the reunion concert may regard it as something of a
miracle, for in its 20th year the JSO was all but dead. The New
York Times wrote its obituary in 1970, using it as a case study in
regional orchestra economics. After a year without music, the city
got its act together and resurrected the orchestra, which in 1972
went to New York and Washington, playing concerts that proved that
reports of its death had been greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Today it has an annual operating budget of $6.6 million, 52
full-time musicians, its own hall and a vigorous season of about
100 concerts a year, reaching audiences of 175,000 (including
schoolchildren) annually.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Atlanta, where sports is king and any of what
economists call ``multiplier factors'' (dollars returned to the
community through taxes, tourism and recreation associated with
sports activities) are incidental, Jacksonville's sports boom
helped fund its arts boom.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the city passed a $230 million bond issue _
to be repaid out of sales tax revenues _ to bring the Gator Bowl up
to pro football standards, and in 1995 it acquired the Jacksonville
Jaguars. But $22 million of the bond issue went to build Jacoby
Hall and refurbish the existing theaters in the Times-Union Center.
And bond issue money is also being fed into libraries, hospitals
and neighborhood projects.
</P>
<P>
   So all is well _ or getting better _ in the city surrounded by
paper mills. And, for a little orchestra with a near-death
experience in its not too distant past, the JSO is putting on a
great big show to celebrate half a century _ minus the year 1971 _
of music.
</P>

 &HT;    Pseudonym, new heroine let Trocheck stretch
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the biggest-selling books of the last decade was about an
antiques dealer and a murder in Savannah. New York agent Stuart
Krichevsky is not saying that ``Savannah Blues'' will be another
``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' but the debut novel by
Mary Kay Andrews has all of the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for publication in spring 2001, the novel features
Eloise Foley (Weezie to her friends), an antiques ``picker'' who
finds damaged or unrecognized treasures at junk shops, estate
sales, or even in the trash, and sells them for their true value.
As the novel opens, Foley, who is going through the divorce from
hell, takes an unauthorized ``sneak preview'' at an upcoming estate
sale and gets more than she bargains for when she discovers the
bloody corpse of her ex-husband's fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Susan Isaacs for the `Ya-Ya's' set,'' says Krichevsky,
who sold ``Savannah Blues'' and a second book to HarperCollins for
what he describes as ``a substantial six-figure advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews is a pseudonym for Atlanta mystery writer Kathy Hogan
Trocheck, who began her career as a crime reporter for The Savannah
News-Times, and covered the Jim Williams murder trial for The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution. That case became the basis for John
Berendt's best seller.
</P>
<P>
   And it was in Savannah that she bought her first antique, the
beginning of a 20-year habit as an amateur picker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go on book tour, I'm always out junking,'' says
Trocheck, whose new Callahan Garrity mystery, ``Irish Eyes,'' hits
the stores next week.
</P>
<P>
   Trocheck says she'll continue to write her Atlanta-based mystery
series under her own name. ``But writing as Mary Kay Andrews will
allow me to write bigger books with broader themes, always with a
strong Southern protagonist,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Kay Andrews is a combination of my children's names. And,
this way, with a surname starting with `A' I'll be at the top of
the shelf in bookstores, instead of down on the floor with the
`T's. My readers don't like to squat to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Trocheck will sign copies of ``Irish Eyes'' at 7 p.m. Feb. 25 at
Final Touch Gallery &AMP; Books, 133 E. Court Square, Decatur,
404-378-5300.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Readers' choices: Saul Bellow is not known as a populist
writer, but the novelist garnered the most votes for the New Yorker
magazine's lifetime achievement award this week. More than 25,000
readers cast ballots for the new awards, established to honor the
magazine's 75th anniversary. Other winners include Edward Said for
``Out of Place,'' his memoir of his Palestinian childhood, Annie
Proulx won in fiction for ``Close Range'' and first-time novelist
Jhumpa Lahiri won the best debut award for ``Interpreter of
Maladies.'' Winners received $10,000.

<P>
   &QR;  Politics and prose: Jeffrey Archer (``Kane and Abel''), whose
novels have not met expectations recently, is being pressured by
HarperCollins to publish his controversial memoirs as a means of
recouping some of the multimillion-dollar advance the publisher
paid the British author in 1995. If Archer tells all in his
autobiography, some expect the truth to be more sensational than
his fiction. Archer, a former member of Parliament and a close
friend of former Prime Minister John Major, was expelled this month
from the Conservative party for five years after it was revealed
that he asked a friend to lie in court during a libel trial 12
years ago.

   NEW YORK _ With one production of ``The Wild Party'' under way
and the second beginning to strut its stuff, speculation was rife
this week that both shows might soon be playing on Broadway
simultaneously. If everything fell into place, this could set up
the tantalizing possibility that two shows with the same name and
source material would vie for best musical at the Tony Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The source is Joseph Moncure March's poem ``The Wild Party''
(1928), which tells the story of jazz-era bohemians on the prowl
during a debauched soiree.
</P>
<P>
   The early word from those who have seen Andrew Lippa's ``Wild
Party'' at the Manhattan Theater Club, where it began performances
in late January, has been predominantly positive. This buzz
apparently has not escaped Theater Club officials and Jeffrey
Seller and Kevin McCollum, the commercial producers who have
shepherded the work since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   While the future of the Lippa version depends on reviews _
opening night is Thursday _ plans are in place for the off-Broadway
show to move to a Broadway stage, most likely the Richard Rodgers.
While the show is scheduled to run until April 2 at the Manhattan
Theater Club, an official there said discussions were under way to
bring it to the Rodgers in early May, just before the Tony
deadline. He added that some members of the technical staff had
already examined the Rodgers with an eye toward adapting the
current set to a larger stage.
</P>
<P>
   This would require the Rodgers' tenant, ``Footloose,'' to close
or move to another theater (with some sort of incentive likely).
Michael David, a producer of that show, said through a spokesman
that neither option had been discussed, and added that the show, in
its 16th month, was profitable week to week. Another consideration
for ``Wild Party'' producers is that any run at the Rodgers would
be limited, for ``Seussical'' is to take up residence there in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The tentativeness of a prospective move seemed to make most of
those involved media shy. The Nederlander Organization, which owns
the Rodgers, offered no comment. Barry Grove, the Theater Club's
executive producer, said only that he was ``investigating the usual
options for life after this production,'' a statement corroborated
by McCollum.
</P>
<P>
   Producers were less coy at the Papp Public Theater, in the East
Village, where ``The Wild Party,'' by Michael John LaChiusa and
George C. Wolfe, entered its sixth week of rehearsals. Plans there
are clear: the show opens on Broadway on April 13 at the Virginia
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday rehearsals were opened to the media, and while the
newly minted Oscar nominee Toni Collette was on display, the
reigning diva was Eartha Kitt. Kitt, looking closer to 30 than 70,
seemed to sum up the mood of both ``Wild Party'' camps as she
purred through the song ``Moving Uptown'':
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear you're moving uptown/ I'll move with you.''
</P>
<P>
   New Lead in `The Dead'
</P>
<P>
   It is a plum role in a surprising hit: Gretta Conroy, the female
lead and wife of Gabriel Conroy in ``James Joyce's `The Dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   And if she weren't hopping to another Broadway show, Blair Brown
would probably be content to play it till the end.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown has another role waiting: Margrethe Bohr, wife of the
physicist Neils Bohr in Michael Frayn's World War II moral drama
``Copenhagen.''
</P>
<P>
   So a search started for a new Gretta, spurring one of the
hottest guessing games on Broadway, with names like Stockard
Channing, Betty Buckley and Patti LuPone tossed about.
</P>
<P>
   But the search is over. (Wasn't that quick?) Beginning on March
13, Faith Prince will step into Blair's role, opposite Christopher
Walken. Prince won't have much time to breathe; she's currently in
Drama Dept.'s production of ``The Torchbearers,'' and will be there
through March 4.
</P>
<P>
   Curtains for Beckett
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that an ambitious plan to renovate Theater Row is
moving forward, Ludovica Villar-Hauser, the producer of the play
``The Countess,'' said Thursday that her show had been asked to
vacate its theater, the Samuel Beckett, by March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Papert, president of the 42nd Street Development Corp.,
which owns Theater Row, on 42nd Street west of Ninth Avenue,
confirmed her report Thursday. The Beckett will be gutted and
several other theaters demolished to make way for a 499-seat
theater, jointly sponsored with the Shubert Organization and housed
in a new residential apartment tower. Also on the drawing boards
are four 99-seat theaters and a 199-seat theater.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``The Countess,'' Villar-Hauser said it was close to
getting a new home. The show's 300th performance was last week.
</P>
<P>
   Taking Title(s)
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Fiennes has a thing for title roles. On film, he's been
Onegin in ``Onegin'' and the English patient in ``The English
Patient.'' Onstage he's taken title roles as a suicidal Ivanov and
a homicidal Hamlet, for which he won a Tony in 1995. Now comes word
that he will take on two more titles, playing the protagonists of
the Almeida Theater Co.'s productions of Shakespeare's ``Richard
II'' and ``Coriolanus,'' coming in the fall to the Brooklyn Academy
of Music.
</P>
<P>
   The plays, directed by Jonathan Kent, will be presented in
repertory from Sept. 6 to Oct. 1. Tickets go on sale on April 1.
Speaking from London, Kent said the plays continued the company's
work begun with ``Hamlet,'' which he directed. ``Both plays are
about power and both about men who, because of a quirk of
character, are unable to exercise that power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ The Roundabout Theater Co. will present the New York premiere
of ``Hotel Suite,'' a play made up of scenes from three Neil Simon
suite plays. John Tillinger directs; performances begin on May 19
at the Gramercy Arts Theater.
</P>
<P>
   _ And downtown, another suite story: casting is complete for
``Noel Coward Suite in Two Keys.'' Judith Ivey has joined Hayley
Mills and Paxton Whitehead. The play opens on April 10 at the
Lucille Lortel.

   NEW YORK _ The Robert Lehman Collection does not have a
spectacular profile at the Metropolitan Museum, but it relates
(often discreetly) to many of the museum's more conspicuous
departments.
</P>
<P>
   When it opened 25 years ago, it formed almost a separate museum
within the museum. Not everyone liked that idea at the time, and
not everyone likes it now. But such has been the enormous and
unpredicted expansion of the rest of the museum that the Lehman
Collection now leads a specific life all its own. And from time to
time it puts its greatest strengths on view, as is now the case
with ``Northern Renaissance Drawings and Illuminations.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection as a whole is the subject of a majestic
continuing series of catalogs. Sixteen were announced. Seven have
been on sale for some time; two more have just appeared. One is
Volume 4 in the series (``Illuminations''). The other is Volume 7
(``15th- to 18th-Century European Drawings: Central Europe, the
Netherlands, France, England'').
</P>
<P>
   Their publication is being marked by extensive but never
overloaded exhibitions in the Lehman wing that relate to one or
another of the new catalogs. Visitors can sit down and consult the
two new catalogs at their leisure.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the abundance of information on offer that I cannot
recommend this too highly. Volume 4, in particular, was worked over
for many years. In the words of Professor Egbert Haverkamp-Begemann
of New York's Institute of Fine Arts, it ``combines new insights
with judicious reformulation of known data.'' Many of the
illuminations are among the micromasterworks of Western European
art.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lehman is known to have seen illuminations as the natural
extension and corollary of the early Italian paintings that he and
his father collected in the early part of the last century. Their
jeweled color, their abundance of well-judged detail and the
instinctive poetry that characterized their every touch are a
privilege to witness.
</P>
<P>
   It was also characteristic of Lehman that when dealing with
drawings he never ran for cover at the words ``possibly by,''
``attributed to,'' ''follower of,'' ``circle of'' or even ``copy
after.'' He knew how much there is to enjoy, and to learn from, in
drawings that were once attributed to a great name but have lost it
somewhere along the road. Authenticity can be disproved, but the
first shock of enjoyment cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, on the other hand, authenticity holds firm. This is
true of the seven drawings by Rembrandt in the collection.
Havekamp-Begemann says in his foreword to the newly published
Volume 7 of the Lehman drawings catalog that they are ``impressive
not merely for their sheer number, particularly since in recent
decades a better understanding of the distinction between
Rembrandt's own world and that of his pupils and imitators has
drastically reduced the number of his accepted works, but also, and
especially, they stand out for their quality and significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Any group of Rembrandt drawings that begins with ``The Last
Supper, After Leonardo da Vinci''(one of Rembrandt's largest) and
ends with the wonderfully mischievous ``Satire of Art Criticism''
would arouse notice anywhere. So would the Rembrandt ``Two
Cottages,'' which Havekamp-Begemann describes as ``a brilliant
combination of the summary and the specific.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other great names, that of Durer ranks high among the
draftsmen now on view in the Lehman wing. There is a particular
intensity about the sheet that has on one side a self-portrait of
Durer that relates to his self-portrait of 1493 in the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side is something rather extraordinary in its way:
a group of six pillows. All of them have been punched and pulled
into strange shapes by Durer. One or two can be read as faces, but
disagreements on this subject are brisk.
</P>
<P>
   Names are not everything in drawing. The monumental drawing of
St. John the Evangelist, which Lehman bought late in his life, has
not as yet been identified beyond ``Upper Rhine, Switzerland (circa
1480).'' But he is a splendid, committed, boisterous evocation of
Christ's favorite disciple, who did not hesitate to drink poison
when challenged to do so (and survived).
</P>
<P>
   Another example is a really very peculiar drawing of ``Men
Shoveling Chairs,'' which is here given to the circle of Rogier van
der Weyden. It is a study for one of three capitals made from 1445
to 1450 for the town hall in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   This was the time when van der Weyden had the title of town
painter in Brussels. The nature of his duties is not quite clear,
but it is an ``educated guess'' to suppose that he knew the
sculptor concerned, or least knew of the project. In any case, this
is a drawing with a subject like no other.
</P>
<P>
   The Lehman is generally one of the quieter parts of the Met. Nor
was it intended to draw an overflow audience. But I often wonder
how many of those visitors who crowd into the rooms of French 19th-
and early 20th-century painting at the Met have seen the paintings
by Cezanne, van Gogh, Renoir, Sisley, Signac, Seurat, Matisse,
Vuillard, Bonnard and Balthus that can be found at the top level of
the Lehman wing.
</P>
<P>
   They are missing something. As a brief introduction to that
period in French painting, this is in a high class.

WATER RATIONING ORDERED IN GALVESTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KEVIN MORAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ Emergency water rationing was ordered
Thursday after three valves in the city's antiquated water system
broke, reducing water pressure in Galveston Island's most populous
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory rationing _ including a ban on watering lawns, washing
cars and filling swimming pools _ could be in effect through the
weekend or beyond, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of emergency is expected to last several days,''
Mayor Roger Quiroga said.
</P>
<P>
   Voluntary rationing had been instituted on the tourist center
after a pair of decades-old valves on the mainland end of the
city's water supply line broke late Wednesday. Quiroga declared an
emergency after another valve at a pump station near the island's
airport broke Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston, a city of 64,000, is about 45 miles southeast of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Water pressure to the sprawling University of Texas Medical
Branch campus in the city's east end dropped to about 25 percent
below normal for this time of year, but not lower than on some days
at the height of the summer tourist season, said Dennis Bailey,
UTMB maintenance and utilities manager.
</P>
<P>
   Booster pumps in campus buildings struggled to maintain normal
service to upper floors but water continued flowing, Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some pumps that have dropped out because of dips in
pressure and we've had to go start the pumps back up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guests attending a conference at the city's tallest hotel, the
16-story San Luis Resort and Conference Center, experienced no
discomfort from the situation, general manager Paul Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a full house, and we've got plenty of pressure to
our guest rooms,'' he said. ``Really, everything's normal here. I
haven't had one guest complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Like UTMB, the San Luis and all other businesses were ordered to
cease landscape watering.
</P>
<P>
   Rationing violators are to be issued warnings for first offenses
but will face citations and possible fines for repeat offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's two valve failures occurred while crews were
preparing to connect a new water pipeline, already laid across the
bay, into a mainland feeder line that runs to Virginia Point, an
area adjacent to the north end of the I-45 causeway that connects
Galveston Island to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the valve failures had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Water continued to flow to the island through a 100-year old,
30-inch clay pipe that is known to have leaks. Water pressure on
the west end of the island, from Jamaica Beach to San Luis Pass,
remained stable.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency situation was declared after an old valve at a
pumping station near the airport broke early Thursday, officials
said. That break widened the area that was experiencing
water-pressure problems but was unrelated to work on the new bay
pipeline, city spokesman Wes Swift said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just old valves,'' he said. ``It just reflects our
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   While the malfunction near the airport was not expected, Swift
said, ``The two on Virginia Point are near where we were connecting
the old water line to the new water line.''
</P>
<P>
   The new 36-inch line across the bay is complete, he said, but
the process of attaching it to the current water system is not
finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that as long as people stick to the emergency
measures, we'll be OK until we get the water line and the system
back to normal,'' Swift said. ``It will probably be two or three
days at the minimum.''

CELTICS HOPE DEFENSE CONTINUES TO SHOW THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Oh, sure, they're all
preaching the defense gospel now.
</P>
<P>
   Win one hotly-contested road game and they're all PhDs in
Preventology. Meanwhile, the coach can only hope and pray that what
he saw Tuesday night in Salt Lake City will be on display both
Friday night against the Golden State Warriors and also in the
remaining four games of this tough road trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics scored 68 points in the second half against the Jazz
in that 101-99 victory, but everyone was saying that it wasn't
about the offense, that the Celtics' offense can normally take care
of itself, that what really got the job done was some outstanding
defensive sequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play good defense, it shows what can happen,'' said
Paul Pierce. ``If everybody gives a concentrated effort on defense,
we can be a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they know what has to be done,'' added coach Rick
Pitino. ``Defense is 50 percent hard work, but the rest is talent
and athleticism. It's being able to move your feet quickly, and we
don't have that much athleticism in that department. So we have to
do it as a team, using energy, smarts and knowing the other team's
plays. That's what we did the other night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pierce injury situation, which was somewhat cloudy the day
before, was much clearer Thursday. After sitting out the Wednesday
practice at the Golden State facility in downtown Oakland, he
underwent an MRI on his right knee. He was back in action when the
team worked out at the University of San Francisco's Memorial
Gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a mild right MCL (medial collateral ligament) sprain,''
reported trainer Ed Lacerte.
</P>
<P>
   Not to suggest that Pierce has a disproportionate significance
to this fragile team or anything, but the Celtics have only
triumphed in one game this season without him. ``With a healthy
Pierce, we'd have won three or four more games,'' Pitino confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say three. That would make them 25-25 and put them at
either the eighth or ninth spot in the East, depending on which
games they were. Make it four, and they'd be in the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the Pierce story is to avoid becoming the lunch
meat in-between two rather large slices of bread named Olden
Polynice and Vitaly Potapenko, whose combined weight is somewhere
in the vicinity of 550 pounds. ``I got caught between them sometime
in the second half,'' Pierce explained. ``I can't remember exactly
when. It was sore in the morning. But later in the day it felt
different.''
</P>
<P>
   The MRI, according to Lacerte, was ``to rule out anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics will become the first team to see the new-look
Warriors, who have been bolstered by the addition of Larry Hughes
and Billy Owens, the former a second-year player of great promise,
and the latter, who, five teams and a reasonably tarnished
professional reputation later, returns whence he cometh nine years
ago. The pleasant cost to Golden State was erratic and hyperkinetic
malcontent John Starks. You want to talk about smiles all around .
. .
</P>
<P>
   Pitino figured he already had enough to worry about after
watching the Warriors take mighty Portland to the wire for the
second night in a row. The Warriors lost, 92-83, at home on
Tuesday, and then hung in until the final nine seconds before
losing a 99-95 rematch the following night up in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a very physical basketball team,'' Pitino analyzed,
alluding to the likes of Jason Caffey and Erick Dampier. ``They
battled Portland on equal terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Before overnighting a crying towel to the mentor, however,
consider that the Celtics will have the good fortune of playing
this 12-37 team without its best player. Antawn Jamison has a bad
knee, and unless he is planning a quick trip to Lourdes, is not
scheduled to play.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison or no Jamison, Hughes or no Hughes, Rick Barry or no
Rick Barry, the Warriors can be had, but the Celtics must apply the
lesson they learned in Salt Lake City. ``It's obvious that what we
need is defense,'' reminded Pierce. ``We are last in the league (in
opponents' field goal percentage), but we know we have the
potential to play good defense. We've got to be consistent every
night. Guys have got to get it into their heads that it's not going
to be the offense pulling us through. We've got to play the defense
_ every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen, brother.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How appropriate that the Celtics should spend Thursday and
Friday practicing in a building unofficially known as ``The House
That Russell Built.'' When Bill Russell was busy leading the San
Francisco Dons to the 1955 and 1956 NCAA championships, the school
had no true home court, schlepping around the Bay Area in such
venues as the venerable Cow Palace. This gym was built in 1958, and
there is a picture in the lobby trophy case of a smiling Russell,
shovel in hand, helping to break ground. That said, wouldn't it be
nice if the USF officials would rectify the egregious mispelling of
No. 6's middle name on two separate plaques inside the building?
They've got it as ``Fenton'' when it's ``Felton.'' C'mon, guys.
Jesuits are supposed to be more precise than that . . . Sorry,
Pervis watchers. Rick practically promised an Ellison sighting
against the Jazz, but Mr. Dreadlocks instead racked up DNP No. 25 .
. . If you're going to be in the neighborhood, plenty of good seats
will be available. This is an ultra mortal lock . . . Cheer up. At
least one station put here is selling its highest grade of gas at
$1.99 a gallon, and some are in the high $1.80s.

&HT;     BUSH'S STUMP SPEECH: PARTLY PERSONAL, PARTLY POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: DATELINE subs for Myrtle Beach, S.C.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By Dan Freedman  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONWAY, S.C. _ Start with a joke about a woman who voted for
someone else, add dollops of ``what's in my heart'' and views on
education, taxes and national security, and you get the standard
stump speech by Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The speech, repeated over and over at rallies all week across
South Carolina, is a variety-pack of soft humor, applause lines and
attempts to define differences between him and Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The speech is not written down and never has been, according to
Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes. It is an amalgam of past speeches
from his days on the Texas gubernatorial campaign trail in 1994 and
1998, and new lines calculated to fight off McCain's strong
challenge to his position as the Republican presidential
frontrunner ever since the Arizona senator swamped him in the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing the two neck-and-neck just 24 hours before
South Carolina's Republican primary, Bush is pulling out all the
stops.
</P>
<P>
   He has ratcheted up his Texas-southern accent several degrees.
`Heah me out, now,'' he tells crowds when he's discussing what he
views as a crucial point.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes spontaneity creeps into the boilerplate. Speaking
at an upscale shopping center in Hilton Head Island against a
backdrop of pricey power boats moored nearby, Bush recalled his own
upbringing in Midland, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have scenes like this'' on the West Texas plains,
Bush says. ``We only saw (such luxury) in National Geographic.''
There is no hint of irony in his voice over the fact of his own
well-to-do upbringing as the scion of the wealthy Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the time, the Bush script follows a much-practiced
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   He always starts with a tale from his unsuccessful 1978 bid for
Congress from Midland. After his defeat, a woman came up to him and
told him she voted for his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't she vote for him? Bush inquired. ``Because you didn't
ask me,'' she replies. ``So I'm here asking for your vote,'' Bush
says, exuding full warmth.
</P>
<P>
   He segues to the story about how he proposed to his wife Laura,
on bended knee, and how she made him promise that she would never
have to give speeches. ``That's the only political promise I've
ever broken,'' he confesses. This line elicits anything from a
barely audible chuckle to a loud guffaw.
</P>
<P>
   Then he gets down to the business at hand, talking about his
qualifications to be president based largely on his five years as
governor of Texas. ``I'm a uniter, not a divider somebody coming
from outside (Washington).''
</P>
<P>
   The implication is that McCain is a Washington insider, having
served in Congress 18 years. Sometimes Bush is not subtle: He calls
his rival ``Chairman,'' a reference to McCain's chairing the
powerful Senate Commerce Committee, which oversees regulation of
much of American industry.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the outcome of the South Carolina primary Saturday,
it marks ``the beginning of the end of the Clinton era in
Washington D.C.,'' Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   The serious part of his speech is always a discussion of
``what's in my heart'': the importance of family and parenting and
of how he would honor the office of the president _ a line
delivered with an unspoken, but clearly understood, reference to
Bill Clinton and his personal peccadilloes.
</P>
<P>
   Children and education are always high in the Bush stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters should not be placed in school according to age but
how much they know, and students should get the help they need in
order to achieve. ``There are no second-rate children in America,''
Bush says. ``There are no second-rate dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly adds he is not running for ``national
superintendent of schools.'' The answer to educational
under-achievement is local and state school officials raising
academic standards and being held accountable for making sure
students don't lag.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's on to taxes and the budget. Bush has taken some hits
from McCain, who accused him of pursuing reckless tax cuts instead
of salting the budget surplus away for Social Security and debt
repayment. Bush denies the charge and touts his tax-cut plan,
saying, ``It's not Washington's money; it's the people's money,'' a
line that is generally a crowd-pleaser with conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Next is national security and foreign policy. Bush sees the
post-Cold-War world as a place of uncertainty, a place where ``even
though the evil empire has passed, there's still evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding the U.S. military is a top priority. He favors
deploying an anti-missile defense system as well as raising pay and
improving conditions for men and women in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   This area is a steep climb for Bush. McCain, a Navy flier and
former prisoner of war in Vietnam, is a heavy hitter in foreign and
military affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush reminds the crowd of his days as an F-102 fighter pilot
in the Texas Air National Guard, saying `I'm not conceding the
veterans' vote to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he winds up his speeches by thanking the people who are
undecided _ those he calls the ``tire-kickers'' _ for coming and
for letting him tell them ``what's in my heart.''

<P>
   Friday's parliamentary elections in Iran cast light on the
unique predicament of a country struggling to survive the misrule
of a clerical theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   If the so-called reformers backing President Mohammad Khatami
gain a majority of seats in Parliament, as they are expected to,
they will diminish somewhat the hardliners' dominance and do so in
accordance with the will of a voting majority. But decisive power
will still remain in the hands of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, and his fellow conservatives who control the judiciary,
the police, the secret services, the army, and everything having to
do with foreign and security policy.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's uniqueness, on display in these elections, is of a
religious dictatorship allowing itself to be changed from within by
democratic means.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, who was elected president in 1997 with 70 percent of
the vote, has been laboring to instill a form of ``glasnost''
within the Islamic revolution. He speaks of creating space for the
flourishing of civil society, of constructing the rule of law, and
of permitting young people and Iranian women to breathe free of the
totalitarian controls imposed by zealous mullahs and their
vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev, in the Soviet Union, discovered that there
could be no halfway house between democracy and the power system
built by Lenin. Khatami and his supporters are launched upon a
similar voyage. If they are to eliminate the corruption and
incompetence of the mullahs who are strangling a statist economy,
if they are to attract foreign investment and integrate Iran into
the international community, sooner or later the reformers will
have to remove the hardliners from their commanding positions in
the economy and the government.
</P>
<P>
   This will not be easy. It is hard to imagine such a
transformation being accomplished peaceably, through democratic
means alone. Indeed, the current system allows no such change in
the principle of rule by the supreme Islamic jurisprudent,
Khamenei. As long as that principle holds, electoral exercises such
as Friday's balloting serve as a safety valve to let off some of
the steam of popular discontent, while preserving the power system
built by Ayatollah Khomeini.

SCANDAL IN GERMANY IS OPPORTUNITY FOR AMBITIOUS BAVARIAN LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The ambitions of Edmond Stoiber, the conservative
premier of Bavaria, to lead Germany have never been much of a
secret. But with the Christian Democratic Union in turmoil, he has
abruptly emerged as a formidable national force.
</P>
<P>
   Stoiber, whose politics stand at the right edge of mainstream
German conservatism, heads a sister party of the Christian
Democrats called the Christian Social Union. Up to now, his party
has managed to avoid the financial scandal ravaging the party of
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   With these credentials, Stoiber has been much in evidence of
late, castigating the Social Democratic chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder, for isolating Austria for including Joerg Haider's
anti-immigrant Freedom Party in a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have insulted the people of Austria,'' Stoiber said this
week. At the time of the Austrian election last year in which the
Freedom Party took 27 percent of the vote, Stoiber was the only
prominent German politician to congratulate Haider and suggest his
party was now eligible for government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Stoiber does not want to be a candidate for chancellor,''
the leading economic daily, Handelsblatt, said Thursday. ``He wants
to be chancellor.''
</P>
<P>
   This evident ambition alarms the governing German coalition of
Social Democrats and Greens, especially at a time when Haider's
success has illustrated the appeal of a nationalist right. This
week, Joschka Fischer, the foreign minister, accused Stoiber of
``playing a role in giving birth'' to the Austrian coalition.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Stoiber saw Haider's electoral success as a
legitimate basis for entering the government, but the Bavarian
leader has at the same time been at pains to say that he ``does not
want anything to do with Mr. Haider politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoiber's domestic position has been considerably strengthened
by the crisis of the Christian Democrats and by the abrupt
resignation on Wednesday of their leader, Wolfgang Schauble, who
had been tainted by accepting illegal party financing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the candidates to succeed Schauble are in their 40s and
relatively inexperienced, giving added authority to the 59-year-old
Stoiber, who has been successful in making Bavaria one of Germany's
most prosperous states.
</P>
<P>
   Combining a conservative social message that is highly cautious
about immigration with a go-ahead approach to new technologies,
Stoiber has stretched his appeal from young Bavarian professionals
to the state's reactionary traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   He was much in evidence Thursday, doling out advice on how to
choose a successor to Schauble. ``We need to take our time,''
Stoiber declared. ``Quality is more important than speed right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``The new party leader must have great powers to
integrate the regions, north and south, east and west, young and
old. And he must above all be able to integrate the liberal center
and the conservative side of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   It was notable that Stoiber used the masculine pronoun ``he'' in
his description of the ideal candidate. He is known to be fiercely
opposed to Angela Merkel, the progressive general-secretary of the
Christian Democrats and one of the favorites to succeed Schauble.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Christian Social Union has played a background
role behind its much larger, more centrist partner, the Christian
Democrats. But in 1980, the two allied parties did field a CSU
candidate in the race for chancellor _ Franz Josef Strauss. He lost
to Helmut Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Stoiber has his mind on this precedent at a time when
his partners have never been so weak. ``The chaos among the
Christian Democrats has made the Christian Social Union much
stronger than ever before,'' the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper
commented Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But several potential problems may hurt Stoiber. One is the
traditional uneasiness in the rest of Germany over electing a
chancellor from Bavaria, a very large and overwhelmingly Catholic
state. Another is his recent support for Haider's inclusion in
government.
</P>
<P>
   A third is the fact that Karlehinz Schreiber, the fugitive arms
dealer who gave cash to Schauble, is known to have had close links
to the Christian Social Union. He has said he has other secrets to
reveal and has given money to ``other parties'' apart from the
Christian Democrats.

   FED-GREENSPAN (Washington) _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, said Thursday that the powerhouse economy shows few signs
of slowing despite four interest rate increases over the last eight
months, and he warned that the central bank will probably raise
rates further to avert a buildup of inflation pressures. In
testimony to the House Banking Committee, Greenspan said the
current combination of strong growth, low inflation, declining
unemployment and improving efficiency among businesses and workers
was unprecedented in the half century he has spent monitoring the
economy. By Richard W. Stevenson.

   IRAN-ELECT (Tehran, Iran) _ Iran's parliamentary elections on
Friday have emerged as a referendum to define the ideals at the
heart of the Iranian revolution 21 years ago. The vote has become,

reformist theologian who was swept into office in 1997 but has yet
to realize much of his liberal social agenda or achieve his stated
goal of improved relations with the United States. By Susan Sachs.

   MCCAIN-CHAIRMAN (Greenville, S.C.) _ In their spirited primary
battle, George W. Bush uses the sobriquet ``The Chairman'' to tar
John McCain as a Washington insider. But a close examination of
McCain's record as chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce
Committee shows that he defies easy labelling. He has angered and
perplexed many of the Washington agencies and special interests
that he oversees from his perch as chairman. His leadership of the
commerce panel and style as chairman are also interesting
indicators of how he might lead if he ever makes it to the White
House. By Stephen Labaton.

   SCI-LIVER-DISEASE (Undated) _ A new possible approach to
treating cirrhosis of the liver, the seventh leading cause of death
in the world, has emerged from studies of telomerase, a recently
discovered agent that indefinitely prolongs the life of human cells
grown in the laboratory. So far the treatment has worked only in
mice that have been artificially given cirrhosis. If it works in
people too, it would offer a new way of tackling a major and so far
intractable disease, as well as of averting liver cancer, the
leading cause of cancer cases worldwide, 80 percent of which derive
from liver cirrhosis. By Nicholas Wade.

 &HT;    CLINTON URGES U.S. AID, INVESTMENT IN AFRICA
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ AIDS will soon double child mortality and reduce
life expectancy by 20 years in Africa unless America takes the lead
in helping Africa find a cure, President Clinton told a group of
advocates for the continent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst burden in life that any adult can bear is to see a
child die before you,'' said Clinton, who was joined by Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright and Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater at the first National Summit on Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The president, speaking before some 2,500 business and
government leaders from the United States and Africa, also said
America must take the lead in ending Africa's bloody conflicts and
get involved with the continent because ``Africa does matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, breaking away from prepared text, said the worst
problem in Africa now is that many children have lost their parents
to to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. He said last year, a
staggering 10 times as many people died of AIDS in Africa than was
killed in all of the continent's wars combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do something about this,'' said Clinton, who was
commended by former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew
Young for doing more for Africa than any American president since
Jimmy Carter. ``I know there are cultural and religious factors
that make it very difficult to tackle this issue from a preventive
point of view. ... But the real answer is to stop people from
getting the HIV virus in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Health officials battling the dread disease have blamed
promiscuity in some African societies, as well as sexual practices
that can make it easier for infection to enter a woman's
bloodstream, for the rapid spread of the disease. And many people,
especially women, engage in unprotected sex because they can't
afford condoms or can't get their partners to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton: ``We shouldn't pretend that we can give injections
and work our way out of this. We have to change behavior,
attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the five five-day national summit here hope to
draft a plan that will guide U.S. foreign policymakers in helping
Africa solve its problems with more than just the AIDS epidemic,
but such as encouraging open trade, democracy and peace.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, most of the world's conflicts pale in complexity
before the situation in the Congo where at least seven nations and
countless armed groups are fighting in a ``desperate struggle that
seems to bring no one victory and everyone misery, especially the
innocent people'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They deserve a better chance,'' he said of the people of
Congo, whose conflict has been dubbed as Africa's first world war.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary Albright, who also addressed the conference, said she
recalled visiting African countries and holding a little boy whose
arm had been cut off by rebels and wondering who did he hurt.
</P>
<P>
   She criticized Sudan's human rights record, urged adversaries in
Congo and Sierra Leone to live up to peace agreements they signed
and noted the world's failure to stop the 1994 genocide of more
than 500,000 mostly ethnic Tutsis in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of Africa's problems, she said, ``We should roll up
our sleeves, not throw up our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Albright and the president said it is time that Americans
stop ignoring the African nations because ``Africa is a cradle of
humanity..... but it is also a cradle of humanity's future.''
</P>

   ``In this world we can be indifferent or we can make a
difference,'' Clinton said. ``Americans must choose when it comes
to Africa to make a difference, because we want to live in a world
... of people who live on the cutting edge of a new economy, and
others who live on the very edge of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Americans know about African nations' conflicts,
famine and poverty, but little about the progress that is being
made. He said they don't know about thousands of African soldiers
who are trying to end the conflicts as peacekeepers, and that
Nigeria alone, despite all its difficulties, has spent $10 billion
in the peacekeeping efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they have asked is that we support their own efforts to
build peace and to make it last. We in the United States should be
willing to do this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has stopped short of recommending a
full-fledged peacekeeping force and instead proposed a protection
force for 500 unarmed military observers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has asked Congress to pay about $42 million of the
estimated $160 million cost of the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to continue working on these things as long as I am
president,'' Clinton said. ``The United States will be a friend for
life.''

 &HT;    CLINTON URGES U.S. AID, INVESTMENT IN AFRICA
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

   WASHINGTON _ AIDS will soon double child mortality and reduce
life expectancy by 20 years in Africa unless America takes the lead
in helping Africa find a cure, President Clinton told a group of
advocates for the continent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst burden in life that any adult can bear is to see a
child die before you,'' said Clinton, who was joined by Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright and Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater at the first National Summit on Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The president, speaking before some 2,500 business and
government leaders from the United States and Africa, also said
America must take the lead in ending Africa's bloody conflicts and
get involved with the continent because ``Africa does matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, breaking away from prepared text, said the worst
problem in Africa now is that many children have lost their parents
to to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. He said last year, a
staggering 10 times as many people died of AIDS in Africa than was
killed in all of the continent's wars combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do something about this,'' said Clinton, who was
commended by former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew
Young for doing more for Africa than any American president since
Jimmy Carter. ``I know there are cultural and religious factors
that make it very difficult to tackle this issue from a preventive
point of view. ... But the real answer is to stop people from
getting the HIV virus in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Health officials battling the dread disease have blamed
promiscuity in some African societies, as well as sexual practices
that can make it easier for infection to enter a woman's
bloodstream, for the rapid spread of the disease. And many people,
especially women, engage in unprotected sex because they can't
afford condoms or can't get their partners to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton: ``We shouldn't pretend that we can give injections
and work our way out of this. We have to change behavior,
attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the five five-day national summit here hope to
draft a plan that will guide U.S. foreign policymakers in helping
Africa solve its problems with more than just the AIDS epidemic,
but such as encouraging open trade, democracy and peace.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, most of the world's conflicts pale in complexity
before the situation in the Congo where at least seven nations and
countless armed groups are fighting in a ``desperate struggle that
seems to bring no one victory and everyone misery, especially the
innocent people'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They deserve a better chance,'' he said of the people of
Congo, whose conflict has been dubbed as Africa's first world war.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary Albright, who also addressed the conference, said she
recalled visiting African countries and holding a little boy whose
arm had been cut off by rebels and wondering who did he hurt.
</P>
<P>
   She criticized Sudan's human rights record, urged adversaries in
Congo and Sierra Leone to live up to peace agreements they signed
and noted the world's failure to stop the 1994 genocide of more
than 500,000 mostly ethnic Tutsis in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of Africa's problems, she said, ``We should roll up
our sleeves, not throw up our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Albright and the president said it is time that Americans
stop ignoring the African nations because ``Africa is a cradle of
humanity..... but it is also a cradle of humanity's future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this world we can be indifferent or we can make a
difference,'' Clinton said. ``Americans must choose when it comes
to Africa to make a difference, because we want to live in a world
... of people who live on the cutting edge of a new economy, and
others who live on the very edge of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Americans know about African nations' conflicts,
famine and poverty, but little about the progress that is being
made. He said they don't know about thousands of African soldiers
who are trying to end the conflicts as peacekeepers, and that

build peace and to make it last. We in the United States should be

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five years in the making, the Rose Center for Earth
and Space _ a $210 million successor to the old Hayden Planetarium
_ will open Saturday, offering visitors a virtual journey through
time, space and the mysteries of the cosmos. It promises to be a
fantastic voyage, but as with any trip, expect a few rough spots.
</P>
<P>
   The domed Space Theater, which is the centerpiece of the Rose
Center, the latest branch of the American Museum of Natural
History, offers synthetic views of the cosmos far more detailed
than the most elaborate Hollywood productions. With the help of a
supercomputer, a state-of-the-art Zeiss star projector, an advanced
laser system, a gigantic data base (in which the motions and
distances of thousands of stars are cataloged) and the hemispheric
Space Theater itself, the builders have created a marvelous
celestial playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   For the extra $9 adults pay to see an 18-minute-20-second Space
Theater show, they take a spectacular virtual ride through the
universe. The audience seated under the dome whizzes past Mars,
Jupiter and Saturn and on into interstellar space toward the
constellation Orion. The recorded voice of Tom Hanks calls
attention to points of interest along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the stellar nursery below Orion's belt, where newborn
stars are seen condensing from vast clouds, the Space Theater
travelers pass through wispy images of green-tinted gas and surge
onward toward the distant reaches of the Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling at many times the speed of light (in violation of the
laws of relativity), the audience then hurtles past clusters and
superclusters of galaxies, finally reaching the outermost precincts
of the known universe, where bright filaments trace a web of
billions of galaxies woven in complex patterns.
</P>
<P>
   For the homeward journey, a fanciful black hole providentially
appears overhead, sweeping the audience into its maw and providing
a psychedelic light show and a thunderous roar along the way.
(Never mind that sound cannot exist in the vacuum of space, or that
a real human being entering a real black hole would be ripped to
shreds by the hole's gravitational field; after all, this is
theater, not astronomy.)
</P>
<P>
   The sky show occupies the upper half of the center's 87-foot
diameter sphere; the lower half is devoted to a very brief light
and sound show depicting the Big Bang _ which, for this visitor,
turned out to be a bit of a bust. It is big on pyrotechnics but not
on explanations, creating more dazzle than enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on a rim inside the darkened lower hemisphere, the
audience looks down and hears the voice of Jodie Foster say that
the universe began with a gigantic explosion. As a prelude to this
great event, spectators are shown bright little rosettes flashing
on and off at the bottom of the bowl. These little blips are
puzzling. Perhaps they are intended to suggest virtual particles in
the quantum ``foam'' of empty space, spontaneously popping into and
out of existence, perhaps they have some other meaning, but they
are not explained.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes an ear-splitting crash, a bright flash, some colored
streamers, and some more garish lights. That's about it. There's no
attempt to address the obvious (although unanswerable) questions
posed by the Big Bang theory: What, if anything, preceded the
genesis explosion, and what, if anything, made it happen? For that
matter, why did the Big Bang theory gain the almost universal
support of astronomers?
</P>
<P>
   Between the upper and lower levels of the Rose Center is a
spiral walkway (reminiscent of the Guggenheim Museum) with a
splendid gallery of 220 astronomical photographs arrayed in order
of their distances in time and space from the Big Bang to the
present.
</P>
<P>
   The spiral ramp itself is one of many devices incorporated in
the Rose Center to impart a sense of scale _ in particular, an
appreciation of the staggering dimensions of the universe. The
length of the walkway, nearly 100 yards, represents a span of
around 13 billion years, at the end of which is a single hair, the
thickness of which represents the duration of human history.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most interesting photographs along the walkway show
the results of gravitational lensing, an effect not explained until
we reach a little enclosure called the Black Hole Theater on the
lowest level of the center. Modest in size, this presentation is
nevertheless richer in content than most of the rest of the Rose
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Using very effective animation, the film explains not only how
black holes are created and what they do but also gives viewers the
flavor of relativity theory, of the genius of Einstein and of the
bizarre distortions enormous masses cause in nearby space-time.
</P>
<P>
   The brief show demonstrates how a massive foreground object like
a large black hole or a galaxy can warp rays of light from a very
distant object in the background, in somewhat the way a telescope's
glass lens collects light and focuses it. Gravitational lensing,
sometimes manifested as bright arcs of light appearing in telescope
images, has revealed exceedingly distant galaxies and quasars that
would otherwise have remained undetected. Some are shown in the
center's picture gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Center also contains curiosities, including a sealed
ecosphere in which little crustaceans and various plants live
isolated from the outer world, thriving on each other and the light
that shines on their transparent globe.
</P>
<P>
   As fearsome as ever, the 15-and-a-half-ton Willamette Meteorite
salvaged from the old Hayden Planetarium rests on a new stand on
the ground floor of the Rose Center, reminding visitors of the
destruction wrought from time to time when such monster projectiles
hit the earth. Interactive television monitors are everywhere, and
a remote-controlled robot entertains young visitors.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   All this is dazzling, but for visitors who knew and loved the
Hayden Planetarium built in 1935, a certain human touch seems to be
missing from its successor.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing the new planetarium lacks the big orrery that was
a feature of the old planetarium. Operated by clockwork and
old-fashioned ceiling tracks, models of the planets and some of
their moons slowly circled a golden sun around the base of the old
planetarium, giving viewers a general idea of the solar system's
layout, relative distances and orbital speeds. Alas, the old
planetarium's orrery broke down several years before the building
was demolished in 1995, and it was not recreated for the new Rose
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the special effects used at the old planetarium came to
seem crude and creaky; as the planetarium went into its terminal
decline, its black-light murals of astronomical subjects seemed as
dated as the fading 20th century itself. But there was something
appealing about the star shows that bridged the chasm between puny
humanity and the awesome immensity of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding the rim of the old dome were silhouettes of
Manhattan's skyline, reminding audiences that what they were about
to see would mirror the real sky overhead. Little lighted signs
around the dome's rim marked the points of the compass, making it
easier for spectators to find familiar constellations. Narrating
the sky show was not a recorded movie star but a real astronomer at
the controls of the star projector, wielding a flashlight pointer
to call attention to objects under discussion, clearing his throat
from time to time, and sometimes even cracking a joke.
</P>
<P>
   The old planetarium mostly depicted things that anyone standing
under a dark sky could see with the naked eye or a small telescope.
In the old planetarium, volunteers instructed classes in mirror
grinding and the construction of telescopes, and experts told
stargazers planning to look up at a real sky where they should look
for Mars, the Pleiades and the galaxy we used to call the Great
Nebula in Andromeda; it wasn't glitzy NASA-style animation, but it
was participatory astronomy for the common man.
</P>
<P>
   As the theater lights went down and the stars came out, the
planetarium's low-fidelity speakers used to play a bit of Brahms' E
minor Symphony, a wonderful musical setting for things vast and
mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   Well, times change. Don't let that stop you from visiting the
Rose Center and enjoying a great show.
</P>

   SARASOTA, Fla. _ It's a new year and Monica Seles has a new
coach, a new racket ... and the same old frustrating problem.
</P>
<P>
   The next tournament Seles plays will be her first of the year.
Injury has once again interrupted her drive back to the top of
women's tennis. It's been that way, it seems, for part of every
year since her career was disrupted in the spring of 1993 when she
was stabbed by a crazed fan at a tournament in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   This time she has been kept off the court by a stress fracture
in her right foot, which has been slow to heal. The injury was
costly. It kept Seles out of the Australian Open, the first Grand
Slam event of the year and a tournament she has dominated over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of wondering whether to go or not go,'' Seles,
26, said. ``At the end we decided that I have taken this much time
off and, that for one tournament, it was not the worth the risk.
Especially to go that far.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Sarasota resident believes she is ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played for so long, I am really itching to go
back.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears her 2000 debut will come either at Scottsdale, Ariz.,
the week of Feb. 28 to March 4, or at Indian Wells, Calif., March 6
to 19. She then would play at the Ericsson Open on Key Biscayne,
March 20 to April 2.
</P>
<P>
   Seles has been through this enough not to expect to step in and
cruise to titles. She knows she will have to play her way back into
tournament-level shape. She will do that with a focus on being
ready for the French Open, the next of the four Grand Slam events,
the last week of May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it will be tough to go back the first two weeks,'' she
said. ``I'm looking forward to playing, but realistically I will be
getting ready for the Grand Slam tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   How far she must go to be a threat to win her 10th Grand Slam
title remains to be seen. Seles says her game is ``OK'' at the
moment. But she really doesn't know for certain at what level it is
because she has not been able to practice much because of her foot
problem.
</P>
<P>
   When she is able to get on the court to practice, she has a
couple of new things working for her. She now has Bobby Banck as
her main coach. She is also using a smaller racket in an effort to
get more power on her serve.
</P>
<P>
   Banck is a popular guy. He had been working with Mary Joe
Fernandez, one of Seles' best friends on the tour. Tennis is
currently on the back burner for Fernandez as she plans her April
wedding to Tony Godsick, who works for the International Management
Group and has represented Seles.
</P>
<P>
   Banck began working with Seles after the U.S. Open and the
partnership is thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is great to have someone that understands the game,'' said
Seles, who also hits with Jimmy Arias. ``Bobby brings a lot of
consistency to my game and we are trying a few new things in terms
of when to hit certain shots. We are also trying to get a little
more power and placement on my serve.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Seles has given up her favorite racket, one that
she took a lot of good-natured abuse for using the past several
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things where you picked up a racket and
loved it,'' Seles said. ``People always gave me a hard time but, to
this day, I love that racket.''
</P>
<P>
   But, at 130 square inches, it was far too big and Seles was
having difficulty controlling points against the big hitters. The
new Yonex is 110 square inches. And one benefit of the time off was
that it gave Seles time to adjust to the new racket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little time I have been able to play with it, I can
already feel a huge difference,'' Seles said.
</P>
<P>
   The time off also gave Seles a chance to travel to Washington
last week to speak in front of congressional leaders while
accepting the annual Flo Hyman Award, presented during National
Girls and Women in Sports Day on Capitol Hill. The award was
presented for her ability to overcome adversity and return to her
sport.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, though, she would rather stay busy
playing tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was tendinitis in her left forearm that disrupted
her schedule, during a year in which she had some success but just
one title. She also had a couple of firsts she would rather forget.
She suffered her first-ever loss at the Australian Open, an event
she won four times. She had become the first player, male or
female, to win as many as 33 matches at a Grand Slam tournament
before losing. She also suffered her first loss in Federation Cup
play after 10 straight wins.

   SC-VOICES (Columbia, S.C.) _ No one who has spent much time
talking to South Carolina voters the last couple of days would
hazard a guess as to the likely winner of Saturday's pivotal
Republican primary here. That's because it's so hard to judge
exactly who will vote. All the polls show that Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas is the heavy favorite of the Republicans, but Sen. John
McCain of Arizona is preferred by most independents and Democrats,
who are free to vote in the Republican contest, the only one
scheduled on Saturday. But who will turn out? In detailed
conversations with voters in five locations across the state, from
the wealthy enclave of retirees at Hilton Head to the conservative
heartland of Greenville and the upstate region surrounding it, no
clear pattern emerged _ except this: it is an agonizingly close
race, one that often divides best buddies and married couples. By

   MCCAIN-CHAIRMAN (Greenville, S.C.) _ In their spirited primary
battle, George W. Bush uses the sobriquet ``The Chairman'' to tar
John McCain as a Washington insider. But a close examination of
McCain's record as chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce
Committee shows that he defies easy labeling. He has angered and
perplexed many of the Washington agencies and special interests
that he oversees from his perch as chairman. His leadership of the
commerce panel and style as chairman are also interesting
indicators of how he might lead if he ever makes it to the White
House.

&HT;     BILL AIMS TO REDUCE MEDICAL ERRORS THAT KILL THOUSANDS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying she was ``shocked'' to learn that up to
98,000 Americans die each year from mistakes made by hospitals and
doctors, Rep. Constance Morella, R-Md., on Thursday introduced a
bill aimed at encouraging hospitals to share information about
their errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at these numbers, I see that more people die from
avoidable medical mistakes each year than from highway accidents,
breast cancer or AIDS,'' she said at a news conference announcing
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Morella said that virtually every other industry collects,
analyzes and distributes data on accidents occurring at different
companies to prevent other firms from making the same mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the available technology to stop putting patients at
risk as mistakes are repeated,'' she said. Noting that often
doctors are unable to learn from the mistakes of others because of
the current failure to share information, she said, ``I was simply
shocked to discover that this was happening'' and that so many were
dying as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Morella said her legislation would give hospitals and health
care professionals the incentive to voluntarily report mistakes and
problems encountered on the job by protecting the confidentiality
of data collected on medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, this information would not be subject to
subpoena or discovery in any administrative or civil proceeding
unless it becomes a matter of public knowledge through other
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the protection afforded by this simple but important
legislation, hospitals and health care professionals fear that
information reported might ultimately by subpoenaed and used in
lawsuits against them, which would lead to very little information
sharing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Morella emphasized, however, that ``if a hospital does something
wrong and a patient starts asking the hospital itself for
information, my bill won't help the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals nationwide have been trying to implement new patient
protections after a study last November by the Institute of
Medicine reported that between 44,000 and 98,000 hospitalized
Americans die each year because of medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine is part of the National Academy of
Sciences, a private organization chartered by Congress to advise
the government on scientific matters.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, medical errors include such events as
botched surgeries, doctors prescribing the wrong drugs and nurses
causing infections because of poor hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   Many errors, the report said, could be prevented if only
hospitals analyzed patterns of problems and put in safety nets.
Unfortunately, health workers often refuse to disclose errors for
fear they'll be sued or fired, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Cousins, vice president of U.S. Pharmacopeia, a Rockville,
Md., group that has developed a national anonymous database on the
Internet for hospitals to share information on medical errors, said
Morella's legislation is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials ``have told us time and again that they would
be willing to participate, but only if they can be sure the
information they provide will remain anonymous,'' said Cousins,
whose not-for-profit group is composed of about 500 members
representing health care professionals, hospitals and government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins said nearly 100 hospital throughout the country take
part in her group's database, called MedMARx, but that the number
likely would increase dramatically if Morella's legislation were
passed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its report, the Institute of Medicine recommended the
following measures: _ Congress should establish a federal Center
for Patient Safety that would cost $35 million to start and would
eventually spend $100 million a year in safety research. That
represents just a fraction of anestimated $8.8 billion spent
yearly as a result of medical mistakes, the report calculated.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government should require that hospitals, and eventually
other health organizations, report all serious mistakes to state
agencies so experts can detect patterns of problems and take
action. About 20 states now require error reporting, but the
penalties they impose vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   _ State licensing boards and medical accreditors should
periodically re-examine health practitioners for competence,
stressing safety practices. Standardized guidelines for medical
equipment and treatment can help doctors keep up. _ Medical
professionals should change the ``culture of secrecy'' that
surrounds medical mistakes, encouraging doctors to discuss errors
as well as near-misses so problems are fixed.

   British filmmakers and performers _  &UR; Michael Caine &LR; ,  &UR; Jude &LR; 
 &UR; Law &LR; ,  &UR; Janet McTeer &LR;  and  &UR; Samantha Morton  &LR; _ were big winners in

to being ignored or asked to leave restaurants.''

<P>
   The return of U.N. arms inspectors to Iraq would do more harm
than good.
</P>
<P>
   This is true no matter how robust is the successor to the U.N.
team that originally worked to disarm Iraq _ that is, the new group
led by Hans Blix, former head of the International Atomic Energy
Agency and chairman of the new U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Simply discovering and destroying Iraq's biological, chemical
and nuclear capabilities is not enough to stop Iraq over the long
term if Iraq is able to simply rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   If inspectors return to Iraq, President Saddam Hussein is again
likely to refuse to cooperate, leaving the United States almost
alone in seeking punishment including military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, besides gaining the complicity of officials at
the United Nations, Iraq has also gained the tacit _ and at times
overt _ support of several major powers: notably Russia, China and
France.
</P>
<P>
   Even more dangerous, however, is the possibility that Saddam
WILL cooperate with the new inspectors. This would spell not only
an end to inspections but also an end of sanctions. And then Iraq
would be free to reconstitute its arms programs _ a clear and
present danger to the entire Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising as it sounds, an impasse will better position the
United States to hamper Saddam's quest for weapons of mass
destruction _ and to avoid being a part of the deliberate flouting
of U.N. resolutions and arms-control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   In the final years of the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM,
which was dispatched to disarm Iraq after the Persian Gulf war,
Saddam chose his provocations according to his own lights,
disrupting inspections or otherwise egregiously violating
agreements when he felt global support for his cause was strong or
when domestic concerns led him to pick a fight abroad.
</P>
<P>
   If the inspections resume, and Saddam picks a particularly
sensitive moment _ say, a setback in the Arab-Israeli peace process
or a burst of internal discontent in Saudi Arabia _ to be defiant,
the necessary diplomatic support for U.S.-led strikes to ensure
compliance may not be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Today's politicians and pundits who champion a resumption of
inspections say that, first, it will lead to the end of Iraq's
clandestine arms projects. Some inspections, they say, are better
than none and besides, it is impossible for Iraq to sustain an
impasse for very long. All three assumptions are false.
</P>
<P>
   The nominal success of inspections today would give Saddam a
free hand to develop bombs tomorrow. A new round of work would
probably not unearth much. U.N. workers would likely discover only
what Saddam wanted them to, or at best marginally improve our
knowledge of what is going on, leaving Iraq's existing lethal
capabilities untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is likely to again find itself in a nasty dilemma
comparable to what it faced on the eve of the Desert Fox airstrikes
in December 1998, when UNSCOM was finally withdrawn. The options:
Either ignore Saddam's deception and pave the way for declaring
Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction, or use force to demand
access.
</P>
<P>
   Past shows of force against Iraq, however, have brought at best
limited progress on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   A more fundamental concern is that if Iraq were allowed to
forbid the conduct of ``any time, any place'' searches and instead
to control their timing and location, it could eventually get a
passing grade for disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam could then push to have Iraq certified as free of
nonconventional arms, which would end the sanctions that keep
Saddam in his box. Better an impasse than a sham.
</P>
<P>
   Before the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the world knew little of
Iraq's efforts beyond the fact that it had a chemical-weapons
program _ used with gruesome effectiveness against its own Kurdish
population and against Iran during the eight-year war. Information
discovered after the Persian Gulf conflict indicated that Iraq was
close to producing a nuclear weapon and had vast stores of chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the United States and its allies mistakenly believed
that Operation Desert Storm had destroyed much of Iraq's
threatening capability. As Defense Secretary Richard Cheney
testified in the immediate aftermath of Desert Storm, ``Saddam
Hussein is out of the nuclear business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Iraq's arsenal proved far more extensive than Western
leaders initially suspected _ and the job for inspectors more
onerous too.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Saddam blocked the inspectors' access, lied to
them about the existence of his deadly weapons programs and
otherwise made a mockery of the whole system. Iraqis repeatedly
stopped the U.N. team at the door and simply moved any sensitive
documents out the rear exit.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's interference was hardly subtle, and its pretexts for
noncompliance were often pathetic. But except for the United States
and Britain, the major powers would not back up the beleaguered
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the work was going full-bore, its effectiveness was
limited. Finding hidden weapons in a vast area is exceptionally
difficult, particularly biological weapons, which require
relatively limited infrastructure and can be easily concealed as
legitimate medical or research facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the U.N. inspectors were never led to a real
success: a complete accounting of Iraq's secret programs and the
destruction of all its proscribed weaponry. Baghdad revealed almost
none of its activities willingly and often lied about destroying
parts of its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of Iraq's biological weapons effort became clear
only after the August 1995 defection of Hussein Kamel al-Majid, a
former general and son-in-law of Saddam who had headed the
clandestine weapons projects. Likewise, the defection of Wafiq
al-Samarrai, the former chief of military intelligence, led to the
revelation that Iraq had manufactured and loaded onto delivery
systems the lethal chemical agent VX _ a surprise to UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq almost certainly still has a small stockpile of chemical
weapons and limited quantities of biological agents and seed stock.
Yet Iraq implausibly insists that its nonconventional weapons
programs have been terminated and therefore demands that sanctions
be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Although assessments vary, Iraq would probably need only a few
years to build a nuclear weapon after sanctions were lifted. Its
biological programs could be resumed in a matter of days. Producing
chemical agents such as mustard gas and sarin would take only a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   So not only sanctions but also strict controls over Iraqi
imports are still crucial to stop proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions have cut Iraqi state revenues by $10 billion to $15
billion a year, slashing the regime's assets. Equally important,
sanctions have sharply restricted what Iraq can buy. If Iraq cannot
acquire dual-use items that can be used for both weapons and
legitimate civilian purposes, developing weapons of mass
destruction will be far harder. An Iraq that can trade as a
``normal'' nation is an unnerving prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Russia is an aggressive advocate of Iraq's cause and a
full-throated critic of inspections and sanctions. France and China
also oppose U.S. policy and _ except for a handful of traumatized
gulf emirates, especially Kuwait _ the Arab states often hesitate
to support U.S. strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatically, it would be difficult and, indeed, foolish for
Washington to openly oppose renewed inspections. But U.S.
policy-makers should recognize that compromises, which offer the
false promise of progress, will in fact lay the groundwork for Iraq
to go its own way.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has spent what limited money he controls on the tools of
war and on lavish rewards for his loyal followers, not on the
well-being of the Iraqi people. Money earmarked for humanitarian
purposes often goes unspent. The regime smuggles humanitarian goods
out of Iraq to sell on the black market. And Iraqis living in the
parts of northern Iraq under U.N. control fare far better than
those under Saddam's political thumb.
</P>
<P>
   If sanctions were lifted, there is little reason to expect that
Saddam would start spending revenue generously on the Iraqi people
and every reason to believe he would blow it on Iraq's lethal toys.
</P>
<P>
   To counter legitimate humanitarian concerns about the harm done
by halting the transfer of some dual-use items _ such as chlorine,
which can be used for both chemical weapons and water purification
_ Washington should push for more international supervision of
Iraqi imports. If the world community can confidently purchase,
transfer and install water-treatment facilities without worrying
that Iraq will divert them for military uses, it could send the
requisite dual-use items.
</P>
<P>
   Such humanitarian acts, however, require that control remain in
international hands lest Saddam's goons swipe the technology. Iraq,
not the United States, is the main barrier to such a shift.
</P>
<P>
   In a wider sense, however, the stumbling blocks in this
diplomatic dance lie not with Iraq but with the U.S. allies and
other major powers who are so anxious to resume trade with Baghdad.
Indeed, America's greatest obstacles are the efforts by France,
Russia and other defenders to readmit Iraq into the community of
nations without requiring it to adhere to international norms.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, standing alone may be self-defeating, despite its
moral attractiveness. But the perfect should not become the enemy
of the good. Renewed inspections would, however unwittingly, help
Saddam develop his weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing inspections may require Washington to stake out some
unpopular diplomatic positions, but given the stakes involved, the
danger of offending Saddam's defenders is easily worth the risk.

LEBANESE STAGE ANTI-U.S. PROTESTS AT EMBASSY NEAR BEIRUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Popular anger erupted outside the U.S. Embassy
Thursday, a week after Israel retaliated against Lebanon for
guerrilla attacks that killed several Israeli soldiers. Hundreds of
Lebanese students joined with other protesters in throwing rocks
and tomatoes at Lebanese army and police detachments, which
responded with batons, tear gas canisters and high-pressure water
hoses.
</P>
<P>
   The protests appeared to have been organized with the help of
Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Party of God, whose guerrillas have
mounted an offensive in southern Lebanon that has killed seven
Israeli soldiers in less than three weeks. In a fiery speech
Wednesday, the Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, citing
official U.S. statements that supported the Israeli bombing, called
on this nation of 3.5 million people to boycott the U.S.
ambassador, David Satterfield, whom he described as ``the
U.S.-Israeli ambassador in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassy protest ended with slight injuries to a handful of
students who were taken with bloodied faces from the scene, several
hundred yards from the heavily fortified embassy compound in Aukar,
a northern suburb of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers promised to sustain their campaign, and Lebanese
government leaders added their own momentum by issuing statements
condemning Israel and the United States with equal vehemence for
Israeli air strikes that destroyed three power plants and cut
halved electricity supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the embassy played down the protests, saying they
posed no threat to the embassy or its staff. ``The staff remained
calm and confident throughout the demonstration,'' an embassy
statement said. ``We support the right to freedom and expression
and assembly. We look to and have every confidence in the
government of Lebanon's commitment to preserve law and order and
protect the safety of diplomatic missions and personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The official calm appeared to mask at least some degree of
anxiety, because even limited violence directed against U.S.
installations was bound to summon up memories of the violence
suffered by Americans in the Lebanese civil war in the 1980s. In
1983, more than 260 Americans died in Hezbollah-directed terrorist
attacks, including truck bombings that destroyed the U.S. Embassy,
then situated on the seafront in western Beirut, and a compound
near the airport that housed a U.S. Marine detachment. In 1984, a
second attack on the embassy caused nine additional deaths.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Selim al-Hoss issued a statement urging action to
restrain Israel by the United States and France, the former
colonial power in Lebanon, which issued a statement condemning the
bombing. Hoss cited the Israeli cabinet's decision this week to
empower a three-member committee headed by Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to order immediate retaliatory strikes if any more Israeli
soldiers died.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in Israel have said the order authorized new strikes
against targets like power plants, roads and bridges, as well as
against military assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new development shows the unlimited arrogance of Israeli
power,'' Hoss said. Citing a 1996 agreement under which Israel and
Hezbollah agreed not to fire at civilian targets or to use
civilians to shield their attacks, the Lebanese leader said the
United States had a special responsibility to restrain Israeli
attacks on nonmilitary targets, ``as Israel uses American weapons
in its aggression against civilian targets in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli accounts said U.S.-made F-16 fighter-bombers fired the
missiles that destroyed the plants.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   From an U.S. standpoint, the student protests showed the value
of moving the embassy from its former downtown location. In Aukar,
the predominantly Christian suburb surrounding the new embassy, the
compound has been built to specifications drawn up after the wave
of attacks on U.S. diplomatic installations in the 1980s. Embassy
buildings and staff accommodations stand well back from the
perimeter fence, offering protection against truck bombings and
lesser violence like stone throwing.
</P>
<P>
   The protests Thursday began with 30 busloads of demonstrators'
arriving at barbed-wire barricades erected by Lebanese forces. The
demonstrators, many covering their faces with the Palestinian-style
red and grey scarves, moved forward repeatedly against the
barricades, shouting, ``Death to America!'' and, ``Death to
Israel!'' Some demonstrators set a U.S. flag alight and threw it at
the security forces.

GAINESVILLE IS A MECCA FOR WORLD-CLASS RUNNERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BOB ARNDORFER   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ You may see them as a blur in the woods,
spinning nonstop around a high school track, or ascending en masse
one of Gainesville's steep hills.
</P>
<P>
   They're the runners, shod in high-tech sneakers, who set a fast
pace in Gainesville and its outskirts. Many run just for fitness
and fun, but among the vast community of hobbyist runners is a
sizable enclave of people who make their living running. They're
some of the fastest people in the world, and for part of the year
they call Gainesville home.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Ukraine is very cold and a lot of snow,'' said Tatyana
Pozdnyakova, 44, who for the last four years has been ranked No. 1
in the world among distance runners in her age division. ``I like
the Gainesville area because it is nice place for running.''
</P>
<P>
   Pozdnyakova is among an estimated 40 international distance
runners who winter here to train for races throughout the United
States and Europe. With its mild winter climate, relatively flat
terrain and countless miles of jogging routes, Gainesville long has
been a mecca for runners. It ranks with Boulder, Colo., and Eugene,
Ore., as prime destinations for world class runners.
</P>
<P>
   But weather and landscape are only part of the reason for the
community's 30-year-long popularity among professional runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tradition is a big factor,'' said Doug Brown, head coach of
the University of Florida's track and cross country teams. ``Since
the early 1970s Gainesville has remained on the map as a place for
world-class distance runners. It started with Jimmy Carnes, who
found support for runners and encouraged athletes to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnes was a former University of Florida track coach who helped
found the Florida Track Club, which began as an organization for
elite runners but today has 700 members in several states who run
mostly for fun. Among the Olympians and other track luminaries
Carnes enticed here were Barry Brown, Jack Bacheler, Marty Liquori
and Frank Shorter, the 1972 Olympic marathon gold medal winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time in the early 1970s there were 40 world-class
people running at 6:15 every morning around Gainesville,'' said
Liquori, 50, who came here in 1972 and liked it so much he stayed.
``Then Shorter won the gold medal in '72, and things really grew
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, it was primarily American runners who trained
in Gainesville's runner-friendly atmosphere. Today, there's a boom
in international athletes who have discovered the area,
particularly Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bumped into a Russian coach at a race somewhere who was
looking for a place to train,'' said Liquori, a founder of the
Athletic Attic sporting goods chain who co-produces the monthly
``Running &AMP; Racing'' program for ESPN. ``I encouraged him to come
here and he brought three people with him. That was in 1988. The
next thing you know there were about 12 Russians here. Since then a
lot of Russians have come here to train.''
</P>
<P>
   Pozdnyakova, who lives in nearby Newberry with her husband/coach
and their 13-year-old son, first came here in 1996. Before then,
she said, she trained at an indoor track in the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very hard for me,'' she said. ``It's a lot better to
be able to run outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Pozdnyakova runs twice a day, every day, usually on the track at
Newberry High, racking up 110 miles a week. In the summer she lives
and trains in New York, where the climate is less oppressive.
</P>
<P>
   Other distance runners favor the soft trails and natural beauty
at San Felasco Hammock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love the scenery out there,'' said Donna Cohen, executive
director of the Florida Track Club. ``It's a very popular place to
run.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Pozdnyakova plans to compete for the $4,000 purse
in the 5K Great Gainesville Road Race, the showcase event among the
20 local races the Florida Track Club puts on each year. Also
scheduled to race Saturday is Andrey Kuznetsov, a 42-year-old
Russian who won the last two Boston Marathons in the Masters
Division for runners 40 and older. He now trains in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Liquori said Boulder's altitude and hilly terrain makes it an
important summer training ground for a lot of runners, but Boulder
has become expensive. Although good distance runners can earn from
$500 to $7,000 in a weekend, lucrative races aren't held every
weekend, and winning is never guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a lot of these people expense is a factor, and the cost
of living down here is so much cheaper than Boulder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Waitz, husband of retired marathoner Grete Waitz, said
Gainesville is the most convenient training ground for European
distance runners. He and his wife, who won the New York Marathon
nine times before retiring in 1990, moved here in 1988 so she could
train. They bought a home here and divide their time between
Gainesville and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Waitz said the East Coast location is attractive to
Europeans and so is the excellent medical community.
</P>
<P>
   Grete Waitz, who promotes races and is under contract with
Adidas, left this week for Norway to coordinate the Grete Waitz
Run. It's the world's largest women-only race, Jack Waitz said, and
in 1997 attracted 47,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   That's an indication of the popularity of running in Europe.
Sometimes that popularity has driven competitors to places like
Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are huge stars in their countries,'' Liquori
said. ``They can't go out of the house without getting mobbed. In
Gainesville they're totally anonymous, and can get on with their
training in peace.''

GERMANY DELAYS TAX PLAN TO END CROSS-SHAREHOLDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ A tax proposal aimed at dismantling the
cross-shareholdings of corporate Germany will become effective one
year later than originally planned, the government said Thursday, a
move that sent down stock prices of German banks and insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But economists and political experts predicted that the
proposal, which lifted the German stock market when it was
announced just before Christmas, does not appear to be in any
fundamental danger.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would allow companies to sell their holdings in other
companies without having to pay taxes on the capital gains. Though
seemingly somewhat esoteric, the measure is expected to reshape the
corporate landscape here because it will allow Germany's biggest
banks and insurance companies to sell their huge stakes in each
other and in the country's biggest manufacturers. They will then
presumably be able to make more profitable use of the money that
had been tied up in these long-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank AG and insurers like Allianz AG and Munich Re have
more than $100 billion in such holdings, and the cross-holdings
have slowed corporate takeovers and other forms of restructuring.
But the banks and insurers have been loath to sell the holdings,
which were accumulated over many decades, because they would face
tens of billions of marks in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, officials at the German finance ministry confirmed
that the law would become effective in 2002 rather than 2001.
Shares of major financial institutions declined on the news,
because it will delay their ability to cash in many of their
long-held profits. Allianz fell 4 percent, to 354 euros, and shares
of Deutsche Bank were down 1.2 percent, to 80.4 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Werner Becker, an economist at Deutsche Bank Research, said the
delay reflected compromises between the government of Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder and skeptics in his Social Democratic Party. But,
he added that ``these are small problems'' and that support for the
measure seems to remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   Holger Schmieding, an economist at Merrill Lynch, agreed. ``This
is a technical matter rather than a political action,'' he said.
``The government wants a significant tax reform and it wants to
encourage the restructuring of the German economy.''

 &HT;    EDITORIAL _ Gunshot issue is just one nagging question about
Mount Carmel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If it wasn't a whitewash, it's a batch of laundry
gone bad. The American people have never gotten sufficient answers
about the horrific events that ended with an inferno and the deaths
of 76 people at the Branch Davidian compound, April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of attention has been focused on a couple of questions in
recent weeks. Both are troubling and in need of answers, but they
are only two among many.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the attention is on whether or not federal agents
fired on the Branch Davidians that day as armored vehicles pounded
at their residence. It is right and proper that a re-creation is
being staged to test the concerns voiced by two film documentaries
that flashes on an infrared tape show gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 100 such flashes are seen on that tape, leading all
civilized observers to hope that the flashes are something other
than gunfire. Even one gunshot would have been too much unless
agents were defending their lives. After all, the intent of the
operation supposedly was to safely flush the Branch Davidians out
of their shelter, not to massacre them.
</P>
<P>
   Another much-publicized issue is the use of incendiary tear gas
canisters, which at first the FBI denied using but which in fact
were used. Could they in any way have started the fire? It appears
not, since they were fired on exterior targets. But we need to know
for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Once and for all, what was the role of the Delta Force, the
military team summoned to Mount Carmel on the trumped-up pretext
that the Branch Davidians were producing drugs? Federal officials
say that the military unit simply was observing. Truth or lie?
</P>
<P>
   _ What was the aim of the armored vehicles ramming the building?
Was it simply to insert tear gas? Was it to open a hole out of
which people would escape? Or was it to terrorize and destroy?
</P>
<P>
   _ What is the forensics evidence? Several died of gunshots on
April 19. Were these wounds all of the victims' own hands or those
of fellow Branch Davidians? Or is there evidence that the gunshots
came from outside? Troubling questions surround the remains of
Jimmy Riddle who, in addition to being shot in the head, appears to
have suffered bodily mutilation that some people theorize came from
being run over by an armored vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike an airplane that explodes over the ocean, all of the
evidence sits before us on solid ground in this case. The most
highly advanced society, with the best justice system in the world,
should be able to answer all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   A civil suit by the survivors and an independent probe into the
events should go a long way to answering some of these questions.
U.S. District Judge Walter Smith has ordered a simulation of the
infrared effects. He should allow press representatives to witness
the re-creation if for no other reason than to assure the American
people that this phase is no whitewash.

FEDERAL WATERWAY POLLUTION AT RECORD RATE, EPA SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government is polluting the nation's waterways at a
record rate, violating the landmark Clean Water Act more frequently
than private companies and six times as often as in 1993, according
to a new report by the US Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four out of ten federal facilities, primarily those
operated by the Department of Defense and Department of Energy,
were in significant violation of the water pollution law in 1998,
the last full year examined by the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, three out of ten private facilities and those
operated by local governments failed to comply with the law during
the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Most disturbing to environmentalists is the fact the federal
government's record of polluting lakes and rivers continues to
worsen. In 1993, for instance, only 6 percent -- or less than one
in ten -- of the federal facilities were polluting waterways.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the EPA's Federal Facilities Enforcement Office
highlights the system of special exemptions and loopholes that
often allow the government to pollute with little fear of any
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies are exempt from many of the penalties levied
under the Clean Water Act against private companies, a situation
which Congress has failed to remedy and which critics say has
received little attention from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal facilities need to pay penalties just like
everyone else,'' said Nancy Stoner, a former EPA enforcement
official who now directs the Clean Water Project for the Natural
Resources Defense Council, a Washington environmental group. ``They
need to be accountable like every other source in the country.
Their record has been abysmal for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Snyder, the director of the EPA office that produced the
report, said government failure to comply with clean water
regulations stands out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the decline in Clean Water Act compliance is linked
with (agencies) not being subject to penalties,'' he said. ``We
think there is something there. The ability to assess penalties
influences those statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series last November, The Boston Globe cited other
exemptions and the lack of enforcement that serves to benefit
government agencies that violate the nation's environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the EPA found that federal agencies had a much
better record when it came to complying with laws in which they
were subject to the same level of enforcement as private companies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the law governing the handling and disposal of
hazardous waste was changed in 1992 so that federal agencies faced
the same penalties as private businesses. In the years since the
change, the record of government compliance has increased steadily
and is now similar to that of the private sector, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of federal agencies failing to comply with the Clean
Water Act is symptomatic of generally lax enforcement against
polluters, critics contend.
</P>
<P>
   A second report, issued Thursday by the US Public Interest
Research Group, a non-profit watchdog organization that has pushed
for tougher enforcement of environmental laws, concluded state
agencies and the EPA have failed to deter businesses and government
agencies from fouling waterways across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The report, entitled `Poisoning Our Water: How the Government
Permits Pollution,'' found that large companies and sewage
treatment plants dumped nearly 270 million pounds of toxic
chemicals into US waterways during 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the blame for the widespread polluting can be directed
at the state and federal agencies charged with enforcement, the
report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most obvious explanation is that government enforcement of
the Clean Water Act has been weak,'' the report charged. ``EPA and
many of the delegated state agencies charged with implementing the
Act have lacked both the resources and the political will to
enforce the law aggressively and provide a critical deterrent
against illegal pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to EPA officials for comment on the report were
not returned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report also chides the federal government for failing to get
tough with its own agencies that are polluting rivers, lakes and
oceans. ``Considering that the federal government is supposed to be
responsible for implementation of our Clean Water Act and therefore
should be setting an example, these figures are particularly
alarming.''

2000 MAY BE A VINTAGE YEAR FOR NASCAR ROOKIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JODY ROYCE   Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Rookies are not supposed to have an impact
on the Winston Cup series. That perception changed after Tony
Stewart finished fourth in the series' point standings last season.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 rookie class may be the best group since NASCAR was
formed in 1949. Only the 1994 class could be compared.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton won the rookie award that year, beating out older
brother Ward and several others. Other drivers who were rookies in
1994 and are still on the circuit include John Andretti, Joe
Nemechek and Jeremy Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony proved himself and I'm sure he's going to be one to
contend this year,'' said Dale Earnhardt, the 1979 rookie of the
year and seven-time Winston Cup champion.
</P>
<P>
   Other top rookies are Rusty Wallace in 1984 and Jeff Gordon in
1993. Six have gone on to win Winston Cup titles. Earnhardt is the
only driver to win a series title after winning top rookie honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anybody is going to top what Tony Stewart did
last year,'' Gordon said. ``That was pretty amazing. If anybody can
do it, it's this rookie class.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven drivers are contending for the 2000 honor. The three most
notable are Dale Earnhardt Jr., Matt Kenseth and Scott Pruett.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt and Kenseth finished first and third, respectively, in
the 1999 NASCAR Busch Grand National Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the attention is on Dale Jr.,'' Gordon said,
adding that Matt Kenseth is also talented with the advantage of
having Jack Roush behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Those two are likely to swap paint for that title. Both drivers
ran in five Winston Cup races in 1999 and each garnered a top-10
finish in September.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. was 10th in the Exide 400 at Richmond, Va., the
one where Stewart picked up his first Cup win. Kenseth had a fourth
in the MBNA Gold 400, won by Roush Racing teammate Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come into the sport they're a lot more in tune and
smarter with what's going on with Winston Cup racing and the
cars,'' the elder Earnhardt said. ``It's really not like being in
the dark when they hop in a Winston Cup car.''
</P>
<P>
   Pruett, 39, who drives for Cal Wells, has the most diverse
background of the rookies. He's a veteran road racer with a victory
in the Daytona 24-hour, has driven and won in the IROC series and
had two wins and four poles in 125 starts in the CART-FedEx series.
</P>
<P>
   But this battle is more than just a three-man race. Jeff Fuller
and Dave Blaney also make the jump to the Cup cars from the BGN
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Blaney will join Ward Burton and make Bill Davis Racing a
two-car operation. The 1995 World of Outlaws champion improved from
29th in the 1998 BGN points standings to sixth in BGN last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rate them pretty high because I'll probably be going to
those guys for advice,'' Stewart said. ``What our team did last
year, there's a good possibility that it could be overshadowed
pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuller spent five seasons in the Busch Series, but saw his
chances take a step backward this week. In a two-car crash Monday
morning with Greg Sacks, the front of Fuller's Pontiac burst into
flames.
</P>
<P>
   The last three Rookie of the Year winners have benefited from
being part of multi-car operations. Stewart hooked up with Joe
Gibbs Racing and Bobby Labonte last year. In 1998, Kenny Irwin
joined Dale Jarrett for Robert Yates. Mike Skinner became a
teammate of the elder Earnhardt in 1997 for Richard Childress. Two
drivers are coming from the Craftsman Truck Series, which runs its
season opener, the Daytona 250, Friday at Daytona International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Compton will try to revive Harry Melling's career as a
Winston Cup owner. Melling prospered in the 1980s with Bill Elliott
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar No. 14, synonymous with four-time Indianapolis 500
champion A.J. Foyt, now exists on the Cup circuit with Mike Bliss
at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss has competed in the Truck series since its inception in
1995 and has finished in the top 10 in the points standings all
five seasons. He was runner-up to Jack Sprague for the championship
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 and 1988, Pruett won IMSA's GTO drivers' championship.
He captured the Trans-Am series title in 1982 and 1994. In his
first appearance at Daytona International, he won the IROC opener
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 he co-drove the winning Nissan 300ZX at the Rolex 24
Hours of Daytona, sharing the cockpit with Paul Gentilozzi, Butch
Leitzinger and Steve Millen.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to the CART champ-car series in 1989, when he was
co-rookie of the year at the Indianapolis 500. His career almost
ended in 1990 when he shattered both legs in a crash in the
preseason test of an Indy car at West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Pruett was chairman of the Championship Drivers
Association, which represents CART and IRL drivers on safety issues
and manages a benevolent fund that supports injured drivers and
their families.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Over the objections of China (population 1.2
billion), the Security Council cleared the way Thursday for the
Pacific island nation of Tuvalu (population 10,000) to become the
189th member of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly is expected to admit the new country
formally later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly spokeswoman, Shirley Brownell, said that the
organization was trying to place a call to Tuvalu through Fiji on
Thursday to tell the Tuvaluans the good news. Tuvalu, which
occupies nine coral atolls halfway between Hawaii and Australia, is
the fourth small Pacific nation to apply to join the organization
recently. Last year Nauru, Tonga and Kiribati became members.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu, with no point of land higher than about 15 feet, is one
of the countries most threatened by rising seas caused by global
warming. A diplomat from another small island nation suggested that
Tuvalu may have decided that now was a good time to join the United
Nations, which took up the problems of small island states at a
special assembly session last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly a British colony known as the Ellice Islands, Tuvalu
became independent in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council vote Thursday was 14-0 with one abstention
_ China's. Tuvalu, with a total land area only one-tenth the size
of Washington, D.C., has diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which
China considers a breakaway province. China said Tuvalu was in
violation of the U.N. resolution recognizing Beijing as China's
sole representative.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has now grown from 51 members at its founding
in 1945 to nearly four times that number.

YATES HAS THE CARS TO BEAT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAT ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Robert Yates sat on the steps at the back
of Dale Jarrett's hauler, totally unconcerned with the fact that he
is a marked man. For a long time, Robert Yates Racing has been one
of the most respected names in NASCAR, although the battle to stay
on top hasn't been easy.
</P>
<P>
   It began in 1989 when Yates bought the team from Harry Ranier,
urged on by Davey Allison. Yates and Allison were competitive
almost from the start, and they continued their upward surge when
Larry McReynolds signed on as crew chief in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the dark days. In rapid succession, Allison was killed
in a helicopter accident at Talladega, Ala., in 1993 and then his
replacement, Ernie Irvan, almost lost his life in a wreck at
Michigan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Yates brought in Jarrett, but with all the strife the team had
been through, it didn't take right away. The team was not able to
run at the level to which Yates was accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   When Irvan returned fulltime in 1996, Yates expanded to two
cars, pairing Jarrett with young Todd Parrott and putting Irvan
back in his primary car. Immediately Jarrett rocketed to the front
while Irvan's team struggled, although he was able to win a race, a
source of pride for Yates.
</P>
<P>
   While Irvan's 1996 victory brought closure, in some sense, to
the dark days that had enveloped the team in tragedy, it didn't
completely end them. It was a constant source of frustration for
Yates as he watched Jarrett and Parrott flex their muscles while
his other car scrambled.
</P>
<P>
   But here this week, seven drivers and about as many crew chiefs
after Allison, it looks like Yates, who won the Winston Cup
championship with Jarrett in 1999, now has a one-two punch to
contend with.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Yates brought in respected veteran Ricky Rudd and
another bright young crew chief, Michael McSwain, to take over
Allison's former entry.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, things have clicked. Come Sunday, Jarrett and Rudd will
start one-two in the Daytona 500 and if they finished that way, it
wouldn't surprise a lot of people in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   The close-knit, family atmosphere that drew Jarrett's team
together is now also evident in Rudd's operation, and that's why
Yates is a marked man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets down to what gets the job done, and you have to bring
the right stuff and then hope you can come down here and know what
you're doing,'' Yates said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the time the 1999 season ended, maybe earlier, Yates
pointed his team at this objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the cars had a little less drag this year, and we
really worked on building quality pieces,'' Yates said. ``We worked
hard on the aero package, and Ford's been good to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd never took a vacation. He worked every day on the cars.
We knew we had a chance to do something special this year, to get
both cars on the front row, and that's a coveted objective.''
</P>
<P>
   So Yates now looks to have not one, but two cars to beat, and
the word is out. Catch them if you can.

BRADLEY ATTACKS GORE ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bill Bradley turned a Dorchester neighborhood into a
backdrop Thursday for his attack on Vice President Al Gore's gun
control record, rankling some residents who wanted to focus more on
the community's renaissance than its violent past.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, seeking a friendly haven in his embattled quest for the
presidency, also encountered a protesting priest who interrupted
his speech to demand a private meeting on the widening gap between
the nation's rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   In one of Bradley's last stops in Massachusetts before the
Democratic primary on March 7, the former New Jersey senator also
brushed aside the latest national poll, which shows him trailing
Gore by nearly 40 points, the widest margin in several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a normal bump from New Hampshire,'' Bradley
told reporters outside the Codman Square Health Center. ``It lasts
about two weeks. Now we're in the third week.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bradley launched his ad campaign for the March 7
primaries with a 30-second spot promoting his support for abortion
rights. The ad does not mention Gore or the vice president's past
opposition to federal funding for abortions, but highlights
Bradley's role as the only candidate who ``has been pro-choice for
everyone all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a crowd of about 150 inside the health center,
Bradley renewed his call for the mandatory registration and
licensing of all 65 million handguns in the country. Gore has
recommended registering and licensing all new handguns, a plan that
Bradley depicted as too timid to combat the nation's gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says it's impractical, it's too hard to do,'' Bradley said
of Gore's response to his proposal. ``I guess that's the difference
in our views of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's spokesman, Doug Hattaway, countered that ``people are
tired of politicians who make promises they can't deliver, and that
is a real difference.''
</P>
<P>
   As a prelude to Bradley's speech, several Dorchester residents
recalled some of Codman Square's past horrors. Among the speakers
were Joseph Chery, who lost his teenage son to gun violence, and
Louray Barton, who had two stepsons shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Barton cited her son in the audience. He ``lost two brothers,''
she said. ``He was very, very young when he lost the first. He was
becoming a man when he lost the second. I will not lose him. We
need to continue to talk about this peril in our neigborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   But others wanted to talk about issues such as education and
community investment. ``I feel dirty,'' said Gerard Hurley, a
security guard, after Bradley's speech. ``The criminals don't even
make up 1 percent of the population, and we're making a big
hullaballoo about them. What about the 99 percent who are not
criminals and are out there working?''
</P>
<P>
   Several other residents voiced similar feelings to reporters and
City Councilor Charles Yancey, a Gore supporter who arrived at the
end of Bradley's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``My constituents tell me they're a little concerned about
reinforcing the stereotype of a comunity of color being tied to
crime and violence,'' Yancey said, though he acknowledged that Gore
and President Clinton have used the same neighborhood to promote
antiviolence themes.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare disruption of a Bradley stump speech, the Rev. John
Doyle, pastor of St. Peter's Church in Dorchester, sprang to his
feet, complained that Bradley's staff had twice failed to grant him
a meeting they had vowed to schedule with Bradley, and demanded a
response. Doyle is part of the Greater Boston Interfaith
Organization, which wants a law requiring all businesses that
receive federal subsidies to pay a minimum ``living wage'' of
$25,000 plus health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not appear ruffled by the interruption. He agreed to
a half-hour meeting with Doyle, and the pastor said afterward he
was satisfied with Bradley's response.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley began the day by shaking hands ouside the Park Street
MBTA station. From Dorchester, he launched a bus tour south on
I-95, with stops in Providence, Old Saybrook, Conn., New Haven, and
Purchase, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   At Hope High School in Providence, Bradley, a member of the
basketball Hall of Fame, held drills with the girls' and boys'
basketball teams and spoke values he learned from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Those values, he said, included resilience, so that times of
adversity ``are not like a hammer hitting a clay pot, shattering
it, but like a hammer hitting metal and tempering it, making it
stronger.''

BANGKOK BUSINESSMAN HELD IN ALLEGED SMUGGLING

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Bangkok businessman accused of plotting to smuggle
night vision goggles and blueprints of a US military aircraft to
the Pakistani Army was ordered held without bail Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Reynolds, 33, a British citizen now living in Thailand,
was arrested Feb. 5 by US Customs agents who lured him to Boston
for a meeting at an undercover export company they had set up to
stop the illegal shipment of defense items.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has banned military exports to Pakistan since
1990 because of the country's failure to restrict nuclear testing
and development. Tension between Pakistan and neighboring India has
continued to escalate.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries tested nuclear devices in 1998 and declared
themselves nuclear powers. Earlier this month, Pakistan test-fired
a new missile that officials said improves accuracy and can hit
targets 60 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who is charged in a federal complaint with conspiring
since September 1998 to export defense items to Pakistan, was
ordered detained Thursday by US Magistrate Judge Robert Collings.
</P>
<P>
   The court appointed public defender Owen Walker to represent
Reynolds. Reynolds described himself as the owner of a company that
sells aircraft parts, but said he cannot afford to hire a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Walker declined to comment Thursday on the charges against
Reynolds and did not argue against Reynolds's etention.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant US Attorney Despena Billings told the judge that the
charges against Reynolds could carry a lengthy prison term, and
that prosecutors believe he may flee if released.
</P>
<P>
   US Customs agents in Boston set up an undercover company in June
1998, according to an affidavit by Special Agent Richard C.
Krueger, after a witness told them that he had been contacted over
the Internet by Hassan Ahmed, of the Sun &AMP; Star Co. in Pakistan,
who wanted to buy night vision goggles for the Pakistani Army.
</P>
<P>
   Agents purporting to work for the undercover company
corresponded by e-mail, fax, and telephone with Ahmed, who said his
company specialized in supplying spare parts for military
aircrafts, weapon systems, and ground support equipment, the
affidavit says. .
</P>
<P>
   After acknowledging that he knew it was illegal to export the
goggles to Pakistan, Ahmed told the undercover agents that he
wanted to ``proceed cautiously'' and asked them to negotiate with
Reynolds, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   During recorded conversations, Reynolds said that he was a
purchasing agent for Pakistan concerns and boasted that he knew top
officials in the United Kingdom's Department of Trade and
Industries who could help him.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Reynolds sent $10,980 to the undercover company
for one pair of night vision goggles and asked it to send them to
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds also used the undercover company to purchase drawings
of Lockheed's C-130 aircraft from an unnamed US company for $18,000
last October, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit says an undercover agent asked an employee of the
company whether the boss knew where the blueprints were going and
was told, ``Absolutely . . . He knows about Jonathan (Reynolds),
trust me. I'd be . . . dead . . . if he didn't.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everyone is cordially invited to a reception at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. It's a daily, come-as-you-are affair,
just a casual little party for friends you haven't met.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe you have met them. The faces certainly seem familiar.
The prettiest girl from high school is here, and that smug
10-to-6'er she married. So is a distant, distant cousin, and a
barely remembered college chum, and even an old flame you'd prefer
to forget.
</P>
<P>
   There are strangers who aren't really strangers. Didn't you see
that elderly gent in the subway and brush past that unisex youth in
the street? And who is that woman across the room with the emerald
necklace and stricken face? An Anne or an Alice, she looks
overwhelmed. By what? You should go over and talk to her, but she's
off in a world of her own.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they are all from another world, one that came and went
2,000 years ago. Gathered together in a time-traveling exhibition
titled ``Ancient Faces: Mummy Portraits From Roman Egypt,'' they
make a haunting ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   The show, a collaboration with the British Museum, where it
first appeared in a different version in 1997, concentrates on 70
portraits painted in Egypt during the first few centuries of Roman
rule, which began with the death of Cleopatra in 30 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rome controlled Egypt as it controlled much else, through a
policy of calculated multiculturalism. Egyptian customs were
tolerated; Romans brought practices and beliefs of their own.
Before long, things shaded together. The mummy paintings are traces
of that process in action.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pictures are done on wood panels in encaustic, a
glossy, durable wax-based medium, or in lighter, fleeter tempera.
In style, they adhere to a classical Greek tradition of realistic
portraiture, often depicting their subjects _ in this case a
colonial elite that took its fashion cues from Rome _ nearly
life-size and in three-quarter view.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, these paintings had a distinctly un-classical
function. They were made to be placed at head level on the outside
of cloth-wrapped mummies as part of Pharaonic mortuary rites
focused on the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings have long captured the European imagination,
particularly since the late 19th century, when scores of them came
to light in an oasis area known as the Fayum. Until recently, they
have been generically referred to as ``Fayum portraits,'' although
they have also been found at other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Were they painted from life? Many seem too vivaciously singular
not to have been. Yet the flimsiness of the panels and signs of
haste in execution suggest that they were not studio portraits
later adapted for burials. More likely, they were done just before
or after a death. Some faces _ like that of the woman with the
emerald beads _ convey physical and psychological signs of mortal
illness.
</P>
<P>
   The Met's theatrical installation begins slowly with a few
sculptures demonstrating the Egyptian-Classical blend. Next comes a
quick, sunny peek at everyday life in Roman Egypt, with a selection
of cosmetics jars, combs and whatnots, and a clay model of what
could be a three-story town house in Murray Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Then the lights go down and the walls turn dark to suggest the
twilight zone of the hereafter. And personalities start to appear,
at first in the form of funerary masks made of plaster or
cartonnage (plaster and linen mixed), some mass-produced and,
others customized and elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   One torso-length mask, rectangular and hollow like the hood of a
car, has a painted doll-like female face with feathery eyebrows and
Maria Callas eyes. Nearby, a similar mask is fitted over the mummy
of a woman named Artemidora, whose face is pleasantly goofy. She
wears an Egyptian wig pulled down over tight Italian curls.
Egyptian deities in gold applique march around her pillow.
</P>
<P>
   This bulky visage is exchanged on a mummy in the next gallery
for a gently flexed limewood panel inserted into the linen
wrappings. It depicts a young man or boy with short hair and the
ghost of a mustache. His lips and brown eyes have a sulky
spoiled-child look, but there's something complicated going on.
He's tired and dulled, reproachful but resigned.
</P>
<P>
   His is the first of dozens of portraits that line the walls of
the rooms from this point on. Many come, as his does, from a Roman
cemetery at Hawara near the Fayum. And each, like his, hints at
lives we can only guess at now.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, with a sturdy neck, a cap of frizzed hair and a
candid, unfazable gaze, could be a suburban mom. A brunette with
the coiffure of a Victorian belle smiles a faint, secretive smile;
she's a Michelle Pfeiffer look-alike. A third woman, her tiny face
shaped like a peach, lifts her chin as if overhearing a
conversation. Her thick earrings of gilded stucco catch the light.
</P>
<P>
   Hairstyles and jewelry have been studied to establish a
chronology for the portraits, although dating, especially of the
tempera paintings, is hotly debated. Everyone agrees, though, that
the art reached a high point during the reigns of the Roman
emperors Hadrian (A.D. 117-38) and Antoninus Pius (A.D. 138-61).
Examples from these periods at the Met bear this out.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of male portraits alone is astonishing. Most of the
sitters are young: a perky corporate type; a pumped-up Adonis, his
shoulders bare; a masher with sideburns and bottle-green bedroom
eyes. Whether the prevalence of youthful faces points to a high
rate of early deaths in the population or reflects a preference for
idealized likenesses is unknown. But when an older face appears, it
delivers a shock of surprise.
</P>
<P>
   This is the effect of a portrait of one middle-aged man,
full-bearded and deeply tanned, with a star-shaped ornament in his
hair. Part of his magnetism lies in the way he is painted, with the
thick, jittery, hatched strokes of a van Gogh. But his insistent
stare _ unwavering, unregretful _ is what clears a space around
him. The show's label says he might be an Egyptian priest, which
feels right, although the hypnotic icons of the later Byzantine
Christian church are surely here in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery at Hawara didn't have a monopoly on portraits. One
of the show's most entrancing images, on loan from the Louvre, was
found at Antinoopolos, a settlement on the Nile some distance from
the Fayum and named by the Emperor Hadrian for his lover, who had
drowned in the river.
</P>
<P>
   It is a portrait of a young woman on a cedarwood panel from
around A.D. 130. Her face, rendered with a fine brush, is a perfect
oval. Her black hair is pulled back behind her large ears and
secured with a gold pin. Her mouth is petite; her eyes, their
lashes individually incised, are enormous. She wears pearl-drop
earrings and her neck appears to be swathed, as if against a chill,
in a filmy cloth-of-gold scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Cassatt would have adored this face, so modern, so
intelligent, so self-contained. If she had painted it she would
have skipped the gold leaf, which, anyway, was added after the
picture was completed. In the ancient world, gold was a potent
symbol. An incorruptible substance, sun-bright, it ensured
immortality, even divinity, to its wearer. Gilding was sometimes
added to portraits after their insertion into the mummy wrapping as
a finishing farewell touch. That seems to have been the case here.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet divinity does not seem to be a state aspired to by most of
the people in this show, which has been organized by Dorothea
Arnold and Marsha Hill of the Met's department of Egyptian art.
They are more like the cast of characters from a Trollope novel
than a pantheon of gods, an assemblage of socialites and
burgomasters, philosophers and jocks, folks who eat breakfast and
fall in love, swing deals, have airs and relish a joke.
</P>
<P>
   They probably hoped to extend their palmy existence
indefinitely, and they have done so in ways they could not imagine
through this show and its catalog. (The book, a version of the
British Museum original, has some editorial glitches: certain
numbers cited in essays don't correspond to entries in the new
edition. But the writing is good, and there's a useful recap of the
latest thinking on the business with dates.)
</P>
<P>
   They have also found a receptive audience in the present.
Portraiture has come back into vogue, and interest is strong, as
one sees both in the work of young artists and in recent or
scheduled museum shows of Chuck Close, Alice Neel and Andy Warhol,
not to mention Picasso, Renoir, Sargent, van Gogh and Ingres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ancient Faces'' is installed at the Met in the galleries that
Ingres vacated, and chronology aside, it's a logical succession.
Ingres and the unknown mummy portraitists both turned a realist's
hand and eye to the privileged faces of their place and time.
(Ingres even had a Roman emperor, sort of, as a sitter: Napoleon
Bonaparte.)
</P>
<P>
   But there were differences. Ingres slaved for perfection, an
exactitude so controlled it veered into the surreal, and he took
his time with it. The mummy painters by necessity worked fast, so
fast that, for all their skill at turning even the most
idiosyncratic facial feature (an unfortunate nose, a droopy eye)
into an asset, they let feelings of all kinds _ despair,
bafflement, anger _ slip through.
</P>
<P>
   Ingres' portraits are ``masterpieces''; maybe that's why they
appear locked in their time in the past. Real people don't look
like this. They _ we _ are blurrier, sketchier, constantly in
formation. The mummy portraits are by contrast very up and down in
terms of technique and observation, some quite fine, others barely
workaday. That's why they make us feel we are among equals. The
reception the Met has given for them is a quiet one _ silent,
actually. But it is the kind of silence, un-self-conscious but
emotion-tinged, that falls among friends.

 &HT;    Family's fight gets national attention
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The staffs of every major presidential candidate
have called 2-year-old Kaitlynn Bogan's parents in West Alexandria
after the family told Vice President Al Gore last week about its
battle over health insurance, Kaitlynn's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a rare disease, Kaitlynn's diet is limited to an
expensive synthetic baby formula for which health plans rarely pay.
The Bogan Baby Bill, introduced by Ohio Rep. Gene Krebs, R-Camden,
as House Bill 218, would require private health plans to pay for
such medically necessary formulas.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore arrived for his Dayton campaign visit on Feb. 9, ``he
came off the plane and came right up to us,'' mother Lydia Bogan
said. ``He said, 'I know who you are.' (U.S. Rep.) Tony Hall
(D-Dayton) had given him information about us. We talked for
probably four minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few days, Bogan said, she talked to the
presidential campaign staffs of Republican candidates Texas Gov.
George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain, and played phone tag
with the representatives of former senator Bill Bradley, Gore's
chief rival for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's people called me and asked for a picture of Kaitlynn to
put in his campaign headquarters in Nashville,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she said the television newsmagazine shows
20/20 and 48 Hours accelerated their efforts to complete stories
about the Bogans and similar families.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 Ohio babies are born each year with disorders that
make all foods toxic, Krebs said, and state-funded health plans
cover the formula's $1,000-a-month cost for about 2,000 of them.
Nearly all babies outgrow the disorder after a year, but Kaitlynn
has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting incredibly interesting,'' Bogan said, ``because
it's like a bidding war. The Republicans don't want the Democrats
to take it for their issue, and the Democrats don't want the
Republicans to take it. We're getting support from both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, however, the Bogan Baby Bill is stalled in the Rules
and Reference committee, chaired by House Speaker Jo Ann Davidson,
R-Reynoldsburg. It has passed the Insurance Committee with some of
the House's most conservative Republicans joining the 14-4
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not going to do anything in Ohio, we're going to
call in the national people,'' Bogan said. She said her recently
formed Mothers Aligned for Medical Advocacy (MAMA) has heard from
parents with similar stories across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was ``noncommittal'' about taking action on the issue,
Bogan said, ``but he said this is not just an Ohio problem. This is
a national problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on her conversations with lawmakers from both parties,
Bogan expects the subject will become part of ongoing congressional
discussions on patients' rights legislation. The health plans
covering about half of privately insured Ohioans fall under federal
jurisdiction, not state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue's not going to go away,'' Bogan said of health
insurance reform. ``This is the heartbeat of the American people. A
lot of people are very upset about health care.''

BANGKOK BUSINESSMAN HELD IN ALLEGED SMUGGLING

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Bangkok businessman accused of plotting to smuggle
night vision goggles and blueprints of a US military aircraft to
the Pakistani Army was ordered held without bail Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Reynolds, 33, a British citizen now living in Thailand,
was arrested Feb. 5 by US Customs agents who lured him to Boston
for a meeting at an undercover export company they had set up to
stop the illegal shipment of defense items.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has banned military exports to Pakistan since
1990 because of the country's failure to restrict nuclear testing
and development. Tension between Pakistan and neighboring India has
continued to escalate.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries tested nuclear devices in 1998 and declared
themselves nuclear powers. Earlier this month, Pakistan test-fired
a new missile that officials said improves accuracy and can hit
targets 60 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who is charged in a federal complaint with conspiring
since September 1998 to export defense items to Pakistan, was
ordered detained Thursday by US Magistrate Judge Robert Collings.
</P>
<P>
   The court appointed public defender Owen Walker to represent
Reynolds. Reynolds described himself as the owner of a company that
sells aircraft parts, but said he cannot afford to hire a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Walker declined to comment Thursday on the charges against
Reynolds and did not argue against Reynolds's etention.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant US Attorney Despena Billings told the judge that the
charges against Reynolds could carry a lengthy prison term, and
that prosecutors believe he may flee if released.
</P>
<P>
   US Customs agents in Boston set up an undercover company in June
1998, according to an affidavit by Special Agent Richard C.
Krueger, after a witness told them that he had been contacted over
the Internet by Hassan Ahmed, of the Sun &AMP; Star Co. in Pakistan,
who wanted to buy night vision goggles for the Pakistani Army.
</P>
<P>
   Agents purporting to work for the undercover company
corresponded by e-mail, fax, and telephone with Ahmed, who said his
company specialized in supplying spare parts for military
aircrafts, weapon systems, and ground support equipment, the
affidavit says. .
</P>
<P>
   After acknowledging that he knew it was illegal to export the
goggles to Pakistan, Ahmed told the undercover agents that he
wanted to ``proceed cautiously'' and asked them to negotiate with
Reynolds, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   During recorded conversations, Reynolds said that he was a
purchasing agent for Pakistan concerns and boasted that he knew top
officials in the United Kingdom's Department of Trade and
Industries who could help him.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Reynolds sent $10,980 to the undercover company
for one pair of night vision goggles and asked it to send them to
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds also used the undercover company to purchase drawings
of Lockheed's C-130 aircraft from an unnamed US company for $18,000
last October, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit says an undercover agent asked an employee of the
company whether the boss knew where the blueprints were going and
was told, ``Absolutely . . . He knows about Jonathan (Reynolds),
trust me. I'd be . . . dead . . . if he didn't.''

Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Front-runners Al Gore and George W. Bush are finding the
national polls friendlier these days than the polls in the primary
states in which they're battling right now. Bush retains a healthy
lead over John McCain in the Republican presidential race, say two
national polls. Bush leads McCain 58 percent to 31 percent in a
CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll and leads by 20 points in a CBS-New York
Times poll. Gore led Bill Bradley by about 40 points in both polls,
a strong position he has had in many polls since winning in Iowa
and New Hampshire. Both polls have a margin of error of 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   HIGH HORSES AND LOW ROADS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush accused John McCain on Thursday of running as a
``high horse'' candidate while using ``low road'' campaign tactics.
``This is a man who says he's going to do one thing and does
another,'' Bush said, referring to McCain's vow last week to end
negative advertising. ``You can't have it both ways in the
political process. You can't take the high horse and then claim the
low road.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN'S `SEMINAL EVENT'
</P>
<P>
   John McCain said his campaign would prove ``a seminal event'' in
American politics, promising to attract independents and Democrats
for a general election coalition. ``If we win here, I don't see how
we can be stopped,'' McCain said Thursday at a Veterans of Foreign
Wars post in Spartanburg, S.C. Two new national polls Thursday _
CNN-USA Today-Gallup and CBS-New York Times _ show McCain faring
better than George W. Bush in a matchup with likely Democratic
nominee Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   FIRING AWAY ON GUN CONTROL
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley promoted gun control today in a Boston neighborhood
plagued by shootings. As he toured the Codman Square Health Center,
Bradley heard from a woman who lost two stepsons to gunfire.
Bradley called for licensing all handguns and dismissed as
ineffective Al Gore's plan to register only new gun purchases.
Bradley also stepped up his criticism of Gore's mixed record on
abortion with a new ad suggesting the vice president played both
sides of the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   CHEERS FROM GAY ACTIVISTS
</P>
<P>
   In a rousing finale to two days of barnstorming New York state,
gay activists cheered Bill Bradley as the candidate most
sympathetic to their concerns. Ethan Geto, who introduced Bradley
at the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in Manhattan,
cited Bradley's early opposition to President Clinton's ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military, his call for
adoption rights for gay couples and his proposal to expand
protections of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   EARLY SHIFT AT THE SHIPYARD
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO leaders took Al Gore to shake hands with workers during
an early morning shift change at the Avondale shipyard in New
Orleans on Thursday morning, introducing some of the voters they
hope will back their endorsement of Gore for president. Gore was
welcomed with a cheer when he arrived outside the shipyard gates at
7 a.m., accompanied by AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. Last fall,
the Avondale shipyard workers won a six-year campaign to unionize _
a victory the labor movement has highlighted as proof of union
tenacity and power.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET AROUND CAMPAIGN FUNDING LIMITS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, his once-massive campaign war chest down to $20
million, has some extra millions set aside from his top political
donors that could give him a boost if he manages to survive the
challenge from John McCain. Bush's financiers have built a separate
$5.2 million ``soft money'' fund that Bush could use in the general
election. Here's how it works, according to Knight Ridder
Newspapers: Bush operators created a fund-raising organization last
year that enabled donors to contribute up to $25,000 a year to
state Republican parties, much more than the $1,000 maximum each
donor could legally contribute to the Bush for President Committee.
If Bush gets the GOP nomination, the money could be used in his
fall campaign. If he loses, of course, he'd be giving McCain a nice
little gift.
</P>
<P>
   WINTER CAMPAIGN OF HIS DISCONTENT
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by what he called a ``pattern of pandering'' by
George W. Bush, one New York Republican congressman says he is
``seriously reconsidering'' his support for Bush. Moreover, Rep.
Peter King said, a ``significant'' number of other Republicans in
the state also are quietly questioning Bush's viability in the
presidential race. ``I'm hearing discontent,'' King said, but
added, ``How far they're going to go, I don't know.'' King said he
was troubled by several recent Bush comments and appearances _ most
notably his visit to Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C.,
which bars interracial dating and has harshly criticized the Roman
Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   IS HE OR ISN'T HE A CONSERVATIVE?
</P>
<P>
   There have been increasing attacks on John McCain by some
Republicans for being a GOP moderate who compromises frequently
with Democrats, or even a ``closet liberal.'' But, says the Chicago
Tribune, those charges are not supported by the votes he cast
during his career in the House and Senate. A Tribune examination of
hundreds of McCain's votes during the past 17 years leaves little
doubt that he does belong in the conservative camp. In the words of
Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), McCain's record follows ``a
conservative line with a populist bent to it.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW ADS FOR CLOSING DAYS
</P>
<P>
   Closing out the South Carolina race, John McCain returned in a
new TV commercial to the themes that launched his campaign. In the
ad, the announcer says McCain has ``the character to do what's
right'' and ``the courage to fight for it.'' The announcer declares
McCain is ``a Republican like Ronald Reagan who can win.'' George
W. Bush also has a new ad that continues to hammer McCain for
negative campaigning, even though McCain stopped running such ads
last week. It also accuses McCain of bashing Bush in a television
interview.
</P>
<P>
   A STRUGGLE TO CATCH ON
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is voicing disappointment with his inability to
capture public attention and, in particular, to connect with black
voters. Responding to questions while campaigning in upstate New
York, Bradley acknowledged that time is running out before the
decisive primaries March 7 in 15 states. He conceded that he has
had little success in reaching voters since the New Hampshire
primary Feb. 1, when he came within 4 points of Al Gore. If Bradley
is to gain ground, he needs to break through to black voters, a
core Democratic constituency. To date, Gore has enjoyed
overwhelming support among African-Americans. ``I feel a little
disheartened by those numbers,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   THE BEST-LAID PRIMARY PLANS
</P>
<P>
   After considerable calculation last year, Michigan Gov. John
Engler and GOP lawmakers moved up the state's Republican primary by
a month, to Feb. 22. The reasons were twofold: Elevate Michigan's
standing in the selection process and deliver a big, early victory
for George W. Bush. But Engler may have misjudged the impact of
Michigan's open-primary status, and now is conceding that Bush
could lose if large numbers of independent voters and Democrats
flock to the polls to support John McCain. ``I think it will be
close,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   WOULD THIRD TIME BE A CHARM?
</P>
<P>
   Just days after followers of Ross Perot ousted Jack Gargan, the
Reform Party chairman who was loyal to a Perot rival, Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura, party leaders launched a petition drive to
draft the Texas billionaire for a third presidential try. ``There's
beginning to be an upswell among the grass roots in the party,''
said national secretary Jim Mangia. Perot finished with 19 percent
of the vote in 1992 and 8.5 percent in 1996. He would face former
GOP candidate Pat Buchanan for the party's nomination and the $12.6
million in federal matching funds that come with it.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY MEN MUSTER UP
</P>
<P>
   Battling the advantages George W. Bush has with money,
Republican leaders and the regular party organizations, John McCain
has been making up for it by building a nationwide campaign
organization using established veterans' groups. He calls it his
``Patriots Network,'' and if he beats Bush in South Carolina, the
former Navy pilot and POW will have a lot of veterans to thank.
There are 400,000 veterans in the state, the same number of people
expected to vote Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ALL FIRED UP UPSTATE

   Bill Bradley accused Al Gore of ignoring western New York and
other places left out of the economic boom while courting votes
elsewhere for the big March 7 primary. Going all out in New York,
Bradley spoke in Rochester, where he portrayed Gore as a latecomer
to an area that has not shared deeply in the past decade's economic
good times.

   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader plans to announce his candidacy
for president on Monday, CNN reports. Nader, 65, will campaign for
nomination of the Green Party, a small party best known in
California where it has elected more than a dozen local officials.
It would be Nader's third campaign for the White House. He ran as a
write-in 1992 and as the 1996 Green Party nominee, getting 684,902
votes nationally and 2 percent of the vote in California.

<P>
   SHOW OPEC WHO'S THE BOSS?
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani blasted President Clinton, his
Senate opponent's husband, for not releasing the nation's oil
reserves to reduce heating oil prices. ``What's happening right now
to our home heating oil prices is outrageous,'' Giuliani said at a
Plattsburgh restaurant as snow fell outside and the temperature
hovered in the 20s. ``He could stand up to OPEC and he's refusing
to do that,'' Giuliani said of the president. Meanwhile, Clinton on
Wednesday released $125 million in emergency aid to help the poor
pay their heating bills.
</P>
<P>
   YEAH, THEY KNOW WHAT SHE MEANS
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, was on Rudy Giuliani's turf, laying
out her goals during a ``60 Minutes II'' interview in front of a
Manhattan audience. Journalist Charlie Rose asked what she would do
if she lost to Giuliani. ``Well, I am going to win,'' she said
without hesitation. She also said she did not plan to use the
Senate as a springboard to return to the White House as president.
``I want to serve my full six-year term, and I have learned that
senators have a whole lot more privacy than presidents,'' she
added, getting a laugh from the mostly friendly audience of about
900 people.
</P>
<P>
   NOW SHE'LL HAVE TO REPORT ALL THOSE TIPS TO THE IRS
</P>
<P>
   That upstate New York waitress who didn't get a tip from Hillary
Clinton last week when the Senate candidate's breakfast was comped
by the restaurant, has been flooded with cash from sympathizers.
Trish Trupo, 31, has gotten nearly $1,000 in gratuities from
strangers as far away as California who read about the first lady's
faux pas in newspapers and on the Internet. ``I'm a little blown
away,'' said Trupo, a single mother who works for $2.90 an hour
plus tips at the Village House Restaurant in Albion, N.Y.

   JUMPING ABOARD THE MCCAIN TRAIN
</P>
<P>
   Rumors abound in California, according to the Christian Science
Monitor, that Secretary of State Bill Jones, who dumped George W.
Bush and endorsed John McCain, made the switch because he saw how
many Democrats reregistered as Republicans, indicating swelling
interest in McCain. Those numbers will be released next week.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK ON THE HOME FRONT
</P>
<P>
   A group critical of social conservatives says George W. Bush,
who bills himself as the ``compassionate conservative,'' has
ignored child poverty issues at home. Samantha Smoot, executive
director of the Texas Freedom Network, a social-issues watchdog
group, said Texas' poor ranking on a variety of issues, coupled
with Bush's recruiting of social conservatives in South Carolina,
is hypocritical. Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said the governor
has worked with the Legislature to make sure all Texas children
have access to quality education and health insurance.

   KIDS JUMPING THROUGH HOOPS

<P>
   If a preteen vote existed, Bill Bradley might have wrapped it up
with his new TV ad starring Michael Jordan. The other day in
Buffalo, N.Y., Jordan's name was invoked twice by Bradley
supporters introducing the candidate. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan
(D-N.Y.), told the crowd his grandson, Michael, 8, was not
interested in politics until the basketball great endorsed Bradley.
Same thing with City Councilman Byron Brown's son, Byron III, 9.
``My only wish,'' Bradley said, ``is that 8- and 9-year-olds could
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   TIME OUT TO PLAY VICE PRESIDENT
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore took a vice presidential detour Wednesday to view
tornado-ravaged Camilla, Ga. His campaign paid for his trip to
Georgia, but taxpayers paid to take him from Macon to Albany and
then for a helicopter to Camilla. Gore spokeswoman Laura Quinn said
Gore did not want to go so near the destruction ``and not have the
administration give it its full attention.''
</P>
<P>
   HE'S HER SON, AND SHE LOVES HIM
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush, mother of the candidate, took a swipe at John
McCain and the media in an interview with the Arizona Republic. The
former first lady said McCain's campaign has ``been boosted by
reporters looking to generate excitement'' in the race. Barbara
Bush: ``Without sounding like I'm whining, I feel (McCain) had
enormous help from the press, because he's become sort of a star
figure with them.''
</P>
<P>
   IT'S HIS MEDIA, AND HE DOESN'T LOVE IT
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes traveled to New York to receive endorsements from the
Congress of Racial Equality and Jews for Morality. While there, CNN
reported, Keyes couldn't resist a swipe at reporters, categorizing
the New York press as ``basically Communist-style media.''
</P>
<P>
   IN A STRONG ECONOMY, TAXES AREN'T AS BIG AN ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, polls have found that although tax cuts
were the top priority for Republican voters, they were far less
popular among ticket splitters, whose votes are critical for party
success. Taking care of Social Security ranked first with them. The
dilemma is now at work to the detriment of George W. Bush and to
the benefit of John McCain. In other words, a candidate can't just
say ``My tax cut is bigger than your tax cut'' and expect results.
``There's no doubt that the whole issue of tax cutting does not
resonate like it did in the 1980s,'' said Bush spokesman Ari
Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   SORRY AL, BILL SLIPPED UP
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton still has time to register to vote for wife
Hillary in the Nov. 7 Senate election in New York, but he can't
vote for Al Gore in the state's important March 7 presidential
primary. Jenny Palazola of the Westchester County voter
registration office told the Washington Times that Clinton did not
register to vote in New York by the Feb. 11 deadline for the
primary.

GORE REASSURES UNIONS ON TRADE PACTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ With organized labor expected to flex its muscle
on his behalf in the upcoming presidential primaries, Al Gore
reassured union leaders Thursday he would fight for them on such
thorny topics as trade pacts with China.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO leaders emerged from a meeting with the vice president
convinced that Gore would place more safeguards for labor and the
environment in trade pacts than President Clinton has.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has committed himself to being stronger on
core labor standards in future trade agreements when he is
president,'' said John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, after the
executive council meeting with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's opponent, Bill Bradley, campaigned Thursday at a
community center in Dorchester, Mass., one of Boston's poorer
neighborhoods, where crime remains a presence and adolescents can
get a gun more cheaply than a pair of sneakers, and he reiterated
his gun-control proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is now lobbying Congress to approve
normalizing trade relations with China, a move opposed by unions
who claim they would have to compete with an exploited work force.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said he will not defy his boss on the pact; however, if
it is not approved by Congress this year and he is elected
president, he will rework the agreement to include provisions that
meet union approval.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders say Gore will help them if he wins the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference between being Number One and Number
Two,'' said Sweeney, who also accompanied Gore early Thursday to
greet shipyard workers as they changed shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's assurance to the unions that he will help them next year
could undermine the Clinton's administration's ability to sell the
China trade deal this spring to wavering members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor is expected to mount a lobbying effort to defeat
the measure and may use Gore's pledges as an argument to members of
Congress to delay consideration until after next November's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to give the Gore administration an opportunity
to deal with this,'' said George Beck, president of the United
Steel Workers union, who attended the meeting with the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   While the vice president did not address the media after the
labor meeting, his spokesman Chris Lehane said Gore had promised
unions that he would integrate their demands into future trade
pacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore supports China's ascension into'' the World Trade
Organization, Lehane said. ``But he has also said as president in
terms of future trade agreements he would look at labor
environmental and human rights agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO, which endorsed Gore last fall, has marshaled its
troops to help the vice president beat Bill Bradley in key states
in the upcoming March 7 primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rosenthal, political director of the AFL-CIO, said union
members comprised as much as a third of Democratic primary voters
in California, 28 percent in New York, and 39 percent in Ohio. Each
of those states holds its primary March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders said Bradley and Gore had similar pro-labor voting
records when they were in the Senate. But Sweeney said that it was
much tougher for Gore to take such stands because he represented
Tennessee, a more conservative state than Bradley, who retired as
senator from New Jersey in 1996.

SEN. KENNEDY TO SEEK HEATING OIL RESERVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as the Clinton administration said Thursday
that oil prices will soon stabilize, Congress is preparing to
consider measures designed to curb future spikes in the price of
home heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Early next week, Senator Edward M. Kennedy will introduce a bill
requiring wholesalers to keep a reserve of heating oil on hand as a
cushion against shortages and price run-ups. And a bill filed last
fall by senators from New York and Maine would make it easier for
the president to ease prices under certain circumstances by
releasing oil from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   News of Kennedy's bill comes as US Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said the oil market ``is starting to stabilize.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe . . . that prices will stabilize. Heating oil
prices are already going down,'' Richardson said on the ABC
television program ``Good Morning America.'' His comments came one
day after Richardson attended a ``heating oil summit'' in Boston,
where he told consumers, truckers, and political leaders that the
administration was ``caught napping'' as heating oil prices nearly
tripled in the Northeast the past month.
</P>
<P>
   Oil heats a far larger percentage of homes in the Northeast than
elsewhere in the country. Analysts say prices have spiked because
of a slowdown in production by members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, and because suppliers were caught
short-handed as a relatively warm winter turned suddenly colder.
Moreover, tankers had a hard time moving heating oil to ports
because of frozen rivers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has already said he will release $125 million
in emergency funds to help low- and middle-income people pay
heating oil bills, and he plans to ask Congress for $600 million in
additional funds.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Kennedy will introduce a bill giving the US energy
secretary new powers to require that heating oil wholesalers keep
reserves at a certain level. Those reserves would be built in the
summer months, when prices are low and supplies plentiful, and
could be drawn down during the winter if supples become low.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would affect only large wholesalers, including the 20
or so operating in Massachusetts, and not small distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The energy secretary already has authority to require petroleum
producers nationwide to maintain reserves, a Kennedy aide said. The
bill would augment those powers so that the secretary could also
focus on heating oil supplies in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Producers oppose the bill, saying that the government should not
meddle in the market.
</P>
<P>
   If required to hold reserves, said Michael Shanahan of the
American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, a wholesaler might be
caught with a big supply during a collapse in price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market falls out. You're sitting there holding oil that
you bought at one price, and now it's worth less. You have to take
a loss,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Shanahan said, it costs money to store oil, and so the
Kennedy bill would raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   A Kennedy aide said the bill was written so that the cost of
holding oil in reserve would add no more than a penny per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy aides also argued that people who heat their homes with
natural gas and electricity already have certain protections under
federal law. Electric utilities are required to keep a reserve on
hand in case of plant malfunctions, they said, and natural gas
suppliers must meet pipeline capacity requirements so that
bottlenecks do not develop, which would raise prices. Kennedy's
office said the bill extends similar protections to users of home
heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York,
and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, have filed a bill that
would ease the rules regarding the release of oil from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton so far has resisted releasing oil from the reserve as a
way to lower prices, despite growing political pressure. Kennedy
and Schumer have called for him to do so, and New York Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani has begun airing television ads on the issue as
campaigns against Hillary Rodham Clinton for a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   The Schumer-Collins bill would allow the president to release
oil from the government reserve when US oil and gas prices rise
sharply because of ``anticompetitive practices'' by foreign
producers.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan of the petroleum trade group said the reserve ``was not
created to be used to affect the market directly, and to affect
supply and demand.'' Rather, the government created the reserve so
the nation could continue essential functions in case of a Mideast
war or political disruption, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law states that the reserve is ``only for national
supply emergencies,'' Richardson said. ``This is a price problem. .
. . The United States doesn't try to manipulate markets. . . . We
don't try to manipulate the price of oil.''

 &HT;    Fed asked to block airline Web site
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's leading travel agent group is asking the government
to block the creation of a new travel Web site co-owned by numerous
airlines, including Atlanta-based Delta.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Travel Agents asked the U.S. Justice
Department to halt formation of what it termed the ``monster
airline Web site.'' ASTA said the site would lead to price-fixing
and violate antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This joint site is a clear attempt on the part of the airlines
to lure consumers onto the Web with lower prices and drive all
their competitors out of business, resulting in complete and total
domination of the public airways,'' ASTA President Joe Galloway
said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, United, Continental and Northwest announced plans in
November to create a jointly-owned, independently-managed travel
Web site to compete with sites such as Travelocity and Expedia.
Delta and other airlines would maintain their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 other airlines have since joined the project. The
still-unnamed site is expected to be running later this year. The
participating carriers say the site will be airline-neutral,
offering unbiased comparative fare information. It also will offer
cruise, hotel and rental car information.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta spokesman had no immediate comment on the ASTA
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents have long viewed airline moves onto the Internet
as designed to pull travelers away from agents and control the flow
of comparative price information. ASTA, which is primarily composed
of midsize and smaller agencies, has also bitterly protested cuts
in the commissions airlines pay to agents.
</P>
<P>
   In its complaint to the Justice Department, ASTA said the
airlines involved in the Web site are ``acting in unison and the
Web site has no apparent purpose but to destroy competition once
and for all and restrict the availability of independent sources of
information for the traveling public.''

 &HT;    Coke board moves Daft, Stahl into top spots
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Doug Ivester passed the Big Red baton Thursday to Doug
Daft.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Ivester retired as chairman and chief executive
officer of Coca-Cola two months earlier than originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   Daft had actually been running the company since becoming
president and chief operating officer in early December after
Ivester stunned the world of Coke by announcing he would be
prematurely retiring at the April 19 shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Doug Daft clearly running the company, it must have been
uncomfortable and unrealistic for Doug Ivester still to have the
CEO title,'' said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage
Digest. ``This move makes everything clean as a whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's board of directors finalized the transition at a
meeting Thursday. With Daft rising to the top spot, the board also
elected Jack Stahl president and chief operating officer two months
earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board of directors had asked me to stay on through April
to ensure a smooth management transition,'' Ivester said in a
statement. ``That transition is complete, and I am very confident
that the Coca-Cola Co. is in very good hands under the leadership
of Doug Daft and Jack Stahl.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester's retirement compensation package will be revealed in
the company's proxy statement, scheduled for release in early
March. Ivester, 52, will be a consultant to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Daft, 56, has thoroughly reorganized the company since December,
decentralizing operations and announcing 6,000 job cuts, including
2,500 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to all employees Thursday, Daft said he wants the
company to develop ``qualities that will make us winners in the
marketplace. Nimble, agile, innovative, creative, responsive and
trusted _ these are the qualities that will drive our success in
the markets of today and tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But, so far, Daft's moves have not helped the company on Wall
Street. The stock has fallen nearly 24 percent since the December
announcement of the leadership change. On Thursday, it fell XXX to
close at XXX.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Bill Pecoriello of Sanford Bernstein believes the stock
will start making significant advances in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are completely focused right now on the
restructuring itself and not on the long-term benefits of the
restructuring,'' Pecoriello said. That mentality will change, he
predicted, once the market starts to concentrate on the likelihood
of strong earnings growth in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the board also increased the quarterly dividend to
17 cents a share, from 16 cents. The dividend is payable April 1 to
shareholders of record as of March 15.

 &HT;    SUV owner to feel it at the pump
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    and Karl Ritzler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ David Mullin just pumped $49 worth of gasoline into
his Chevrolet Suburban at the local Texaco station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am upset about these increases, but I realize I can't do
anything about them,'' said the salesman who fills the tank about
every five days. But he has no plans to trade the big sport-utility
vehicle in on something smaller and more fuel-efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this car. It gives a good ride. It is safe. There is
room enough to haul things. I would keep it even if gas went up to
$3 a gallon _ but it does cut into my spendable income.''
</P>
<P>
   As the price of gasoline has climbed to record levels in the
past week, and up 40 cents a gallon overall since last year, owners
of big sport-utility vehicles don't plan to change vehicles. But
they might join other drivers in changing some driving habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will change the way they drive, not change their car.
It's smarter economically,'' said Jim Hall, vice president for
industry analysis with AutoPacific Group in Detroit. Those steps
might include making fewer or shorter trips and slowing down on the
interstate.
</P>
<P>
   In the current economic boom, people just don't care that much
about gasoline prices, said Mark Bowen, general manager for
Hyundai, Subaru and Oldsmobile for the Ed Voyles automotive group
of dealerships in Smyrna. ``The increase in gas prices hasn't hurt
big car sales, and it hasn't helped small cars either,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, gasoline prices have risen at a time when dealers have
high inventories of sport-utilities. Analyst Matt Darnell with J.D.
Power and Associates in Detroit doesn't blame gas, though. ``The
market is maturing, and the rate of sales growth is slower,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As more competitors enter the segment, as they have over the
past year, there will be fewer sales per model.
</P>
<P>
   People love the size, style and image of sport-utilities in
spite of what it costs to fill them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing eats gas, but I love it,'' declared Phyllis Crews
of Dunwoody, who spent $28.90 Wednesday topping off her 1999 Land
Rover. She paid $46,000 for the four-wheel-drive model with a V-8
engine. ``It is my favorite thing I have ever driven.''
</P>
<P>
   When you're driving vehicles that have sticker prices
approaching $50,000, an extra $10 to $20 a week for gas may not
seem like that much. Even at current prices, Hall noted, gasoline
is cheaper than Perrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers need to perceive constant high (gasoline) prices for
a long time'' before it influences their car-buying decisions, said
Darnell.
</P>
<P>
   He and other experts don't see prices staying at higher levels
for a long period.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel that fuel prices will come down again, and they
will,'' said Hall. ``The (OPEC oil) cartel can't hold the prices up
for very long; some guy will break it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tori Young, whose family has run a service station at Mount
Vernon and Chamblee-Dunwoody roads since 1975, thinks the situation
will get worse before it gets better. ``People ask me every day
when prices are going back down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who drives a big sport-utility herself, said Amoco told
her to raise her price by 3 cents a gallon at midnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Young said, people still have to drive.

 &HT;    Greenspan sees rate increases
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan removed any doubt
Thursday that interest rates on business and consumer loans are
headed higher.
</P>
<P>
   In his semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress,
Greenspan said the U.S. economy is still growing too fast despite
four short-term interest rate increases since June.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little evidence that the American economy, which grew
more than 4 percent in 1999 and surged forward at an even faster
rate in the second half of the year, is slowing appreciably,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Fed will stick to a policy of ``incremental
interest-rate increases'' this year to avert inflation _ even
though, at the moment, ``inflation has remained largely
contained.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no `irrational exuberance' speech, but the message was
the same: there will be more rate hikes on the horizon,'' said
Prudential Securities analyst Bryan Piskorowski. He was alluding to
Greenspan's famous 1996 charge that speculation in stocks was a
threat to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of higher interest rates sent financial and other
interest-sensitive stocks lower, depressing the Dow Jones
industrial average. But the Nasdaq composite surged 2.7 percent to
its first finish over 4,500 as technology stocks continued to
advance on strong profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on the 30-year Treasury bond fell, benefiting, analysts
said, from the current low inflation environment and the prospect
of Fed protection against renewed inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's statements overshadowed another piece of good news:
the government's report that wholesale prices were unchanged in
January after rising 0.1 percent in December. The core rate _ minus
food and energy costs _ fell 0.2 percent vs. a rise of 0.1 percent
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's testimony contained his strongest statements yet
that something more than a 1 percentage point increase in
short-term rates will be needed to restrain the economy and head
off an outbreak of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised the target rate for its overnight federal
funds to 5.75 percent in four quarter-percentage-point steps since
June. But the economy, measured by gross domestic product, rose
from a 3.7 percent annual rate in the first quarter to an estimated
5.8 percent in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has maintained all along that the economy must slow to
an annual growth of 2 percent to 2.5 percent to maintain job growth
without causing inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Fed was in this situation was 1994-1995, when
it raised the federal funds rate 3 percentage points to 6 percent.
Annualized GDP growth dropped in that same period to 0.8 percent
from 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy rallied briskly from the 1995 low and produced
four straight years of 4 percent annual growth through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan reiterated his earlier explanation that the economy
expanded without serious inflation thanks to strong productivity
gains.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, corporate profit growth encouraged investment
in the stock market, where the wealth effect of the long-running
rise in share prices buoyed the economy by encouraging consumers to
spend beyond their annual incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historical evidence suggests that perhaps 3 to 4 cents out of
every additional dollar of stock market wealth eventually is
reflected in increased consumer purchases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said it isn't necessary for stock prices to come down,
as long as the market grows ``no faster than household incomes.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest inflation threat, according to Greenspan, lies in
the tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point in the continuous reduction in the number of
available workers willing to take jobs . . . wage increases must
rise above even impressive gains in productivity,'' he said. ``This
would intensify inflationary pressures, or squeeze profit margins,
with either outcome capable of bringing our growing prosperity to
an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also warned that some of the other forces that held
consumer prices down in recent years are disappearing, including
foreign economic weakness that resulted in a flood of cheap
products into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong growth in foreign economic activity is expected to
continue this year, and, other things equal, the effect of the
previous appreciation of the dollar should wane, augmenting demand
on U.S. resources and lessening one source of downward pressure on
our prices,'' Greenspan explained.

BUSH, MCCAIN BATTLING TO A DEAD HEAT IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Two days before the Republican showdown at
the polls here, John McCain waved his self-described positive
campaign like a banner, while Texas Governor George W. Bush accused
him of being a ``high horse candidate'' who's really taking the low
road.
</P>
<P>
   A new tracking poll by John Zogby showed a dead even race
Thursday, with 43 percent for Bush and 42 percent for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign and its surrogates took pains throughout the
day to equate a vote for McCain with a vote for positive
campaigning. On the banks of the Reedy River, inside an open-air
pavilion, Mayor Knox White denounced the barrage of television
commercials, push-polling, brochures and e-mails coming from the
Bush campaign before several hundred flag-waving supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sick and tired of negative campaigning!'' he thundered.
</P>
<P>
   And Representative Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina
Republican, said the Bush campaign is giving 1,001 reasons not to
vote for McCain, in ways that suggest he is not a good man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks in South Carolina are smarter than they say we are,''
Graham said to cheers and applause.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his supporters are hoping that by Saturday, enough
voters will be as sick of the saturation, negative commercials as
Jennifer Jerozal, a new stay-at-home mother from this northwest
corner of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Jerozal had initially planned to vote for Bush, thinking he
seemed ``strong.'' But she got fed up with the political ads, and
was impressed when McCain took his attack ad down and vowed to run
only positive commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had enough bad examples for our children,'' she said,
cradling her six-month-old daughter, Catherine, with a McCain
sticker centered on her white-knit bonnet. ``This is my deciding
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain officials say they are hoping Bush steps up his attacks
and are fearful that the governor might turn positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to throw some more at us,'' said Rick Davis,
McCain's campaign manager, as he examined polling data showing the
senator moving up despite the onslaught. ``Hit us again, come on,
be mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the state in Myrtle Beach, Bush continued to accuse
McCain of distributing a flier riddled with false statements,
including a charge that Bush would squander the budget surplus
instead of preserving Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the Straight Talk Express might've lost a
wheel,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing factual about this,'' he continued, holding up
a copy of one leaflet. ``The senator's got to understand: He can't
have it both ways. He can't take the high horse and then claim the
low road.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he did not know if his campaign is still
distributing the flier, but insisted it is accurate and fair.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also faced questions Thursday about his dwindling campaign
funds for a second day in a row. He was clearly irritated by a
question about how he planned to handle the federal budget when it
appeared he could not effectively manage his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give people their money back,'' Bush snapped,
referring to his tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of relatively heavy campaigning for Bush. After
appearing on ``Good Morning America'' and ``The Early Show,'' Bush
held a question-and-answer session in Florence before flying to
Myrtle Beach, with two more events scheduled for later in the day.
Both drew sizable crowds, but at both early events, large numbers
of people left before the end. The later events were well attended
and the ctrowds were enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed unfazed by the mild reaction of some of his
audiences. He also seemed relatively confident about recent reports
Democrats might flood the Republican primary to vote for McCain. If
they did so, Bush said, it would be in order to boost the candidate
less likely to beat a Democrat. Cross-party voting is allowed in
the South Carolina primary but voters cannot register on the day of
the election.
</P>
<P>
   Former South Carolina Governor Carroll Campbell, campaigning
with Bush as he has for the last two weeks, said it was impossible
Democrats were genuinely interested in McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only possible they're scared of Bush,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, continued to talk of re-creating Ronald
Reagan's governing coalition of Republicans, independents and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In Spartanburg, McCain called the election Saturday a seminal
event that could restore young people's confidence in government.
And he said he was beginning to see the crowds and feel the
enthusiasm that built for him in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we can lose here and go on,'' McCain told the veterans
eating pancakes at the local VFW. ``This campaign is not over until
March 7 with California and a number of other states. But I'll tell
you what, friends, we win here, I don't see how we can really be
stopped.''

GORE, UNIONS AT ODDS OVER CHINA TRADE STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Al Gore and labor leaders Thursday clashed over
the Clinton-Gore administration's plan to grant permanent trade
status to China, but both sides agreed on one goal _ getting the
vice president elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with AFL-CIO leaders for the first time since the
powerful labor group helped his campaign last fall with its
endorsement, Gore sympathized with their opposition to the
administration's push to establish normal trade relations with
China, according to some who attended the two-hour closed door
meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating previous statements, Gore promised that as president
he would require future trade agreements with China to include the
labor, environmental and human rights provisions in the core
agreements _ as the unions want _ rather than in side agreements _
an approach President Clinton has taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has committed himself to being stronger on
core labor standards in future trade agreements when he's
president,'' said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Gore could join Clinton in pushing the current
agreement with China while promising to be stronger if elected
president, Sweeney said, ``That's the difference between being
number one and number two.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sweeney spoke to reporters, Gore press secretary Chris
Lehane made clear that the vice president supports the current
trade agreement with China ``and is optimistic that it will get
through this legislative session.''
</P>
<P>
   While not offering specifics on how Gore will aid Clinton in
promoting the bill in Congress, Lehane added: ``He's the vice
president. He'll work with the administration in the appropriate
way. As we move down the road, we'll see'' what the appropriate way
is.
</P>
<P>
   George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America,
said labor unions would launch an all-out campaign to get the
legislation on China delayed until next year in hopes that Gore
will be elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor intends to see that this is defeated,'' Becker said.
``We would like to give the Gore administration the opportunity to
deal with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore can ill-afford alienating union members, a majority of whom
support core labor standards and environmental protections as part
of future labor agreements. Their turnout will be crucial to Gore
in several states in the March 7 primaries _ including in
California, New York, Ohio, Maryland and Massachusetts _ and they
were decisive in his victory in the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of two unions _ the Teamsters and the United Auto
Workers _ which have not endorsed Gore, skipped Thursday's meeting
with him. About 400 union leaders attending the 13-state Eastern
regional meeting of the Teamsters hosted Gore's rival for the
Democratic nomination, former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, at a
meeting in Atlantic City, N.J., earlier this week, giving him a
standing ovation and an impromptu endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Before his meeting with labor leaders, Gore shook hands with
workers during an early-morning shift change at the Avondale
shipyard, where workers last fall won a six-year campaign to
unionize. Later, he made the first trip of his presidential
campaign to Mississippi, addressing several hundred supporters on
the topic of health care for children in Jackson.

CLINTON CITES AFRICA'S UNHERALDED ACHIEVEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After being greeted by the banging of ``talking
drums'' from Ghana and Gambia traditionally used to herald the
arrival of a great leader, President Clinton Thursday told 2,300
delegates attending the National Summit on Africa that Americans
``must choose, when it comes to Africa, to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly the plan of the delegates, including 50 from
Massachusetts, who will be spending the next three days here
working out a national agenda to advance African economic, health
and security interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was warmly received in a large convention hall,
said Africa may suffer from a great number of crises, but it also
has achieved great accomplishments _ most of them overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen thousands of triumphs, large and small,'' he
said. ``I wish every American knew last year the world's fastest
growing economy was Mozambique. Botswana was second, Angola fourth.
. . . People know all about Africa's conflicts, but how many know
that thousands of African soldiers are trying to end those
conflicts as peacekeepers?''
</P>
<P>
   The conference is the result of five years of planning and
hundreds of community meetings around the country in hopes of
building an African lobby that would give the continent something
it has always lacked: clout in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts delegation, like those from the other 49
states, came carrying a plan of action promoting three strategies,
including campaigns aimed at defeating the AIDS pandemic; elevating
women's groups as key players on issues of peace and security; and
developing business relationships between Africa and the US East
Coast using models from US-Asian partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to start building the internal capacity nationally . .
. to move forward and implement our agenda,'' said Jemadai Kamara,
a University of Massachusetts professor heading the state
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Herman J. Cohen, former assistant secretary of state for African
affairs in the Bush administration, said in an interview that he
remembered when, in 1977, then-US Ambassador to the UN Andrew Young
told him that the US lobby for Africa ``needed to be able to get
5,000 faxes on the desks of every member of Congress whenever they
had an urgent issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never gotten to that point,'' said Cohen, who was
attending the conference. ``Will this summit bring it together? I
hope so. I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, delegates heard several stirring speeches, including one
by the chairman of WorldSpace Corp., Noah A. Samara, an Ethiopian
native who talked about the power of individuals and small groups
to ``change the state of affairs in our world.''
</P>
<P>
   Samara put up a satellite over Africa that gives direct audio
and multimedia broadcasting to hand-held receivers. He and a few
others raised over $1 billion in private capital toward a goal of
``an information-affluent African society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no fear to stand alone in my conviction that Africa
will overcome its problems,'' he said. ``The question for us is not
whether the inevitable will happen; but whether our fingerprint
will be among that small group of thoughtful, committed people who
actually changed the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The audience stood and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton arrived, to strains of ``Hail to the Chief,''
followed by the banging of the drums.
</P>
<P>
   He called for more open markets to Africa, including passage of
an African trade bill now mired in a conference committee in
Congress; more debt relief atop a US $500 million commitment, which
will make only a small dent in the billions of dollars in debts
carried by African nations; spending more money on education;
fighting killer diseases of AIDS, tuberculosis and maleria; and
pushing African leaders to end the wars that currently afflict 11
of the continent's 54 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at length on the AIDS crisis. He said, slowly,
``AIDS is going to reduce the life expectancy in Africa by 20
years. . . . In Africa, there are companies that are hiring two
employees for every job on the assumption that one of them will
die.''
</P>
<P>
   He said even if an AIDS vaccine were developed, that wouldn't
solve the problem. He said African leaders must emphasize
prevention to a far greater extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how hard or delicate or difficult this is,'' he
said. ``This is your children's lives we're talking about. . . . We
shouldn't pretend that we can give injections and work our way out
of this. We have to change behavior, attitudes.''

U.N. POSTS FULL-TIME ADVOCATES FOR CHILDREN AT LOCATIONS ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ For the first time in the history of its
international peacekeeping missions, the United Nations has begun
assigning full-time advocates of children to operations centers
abroad, the secretary-general's special representative on children
and conflict said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows increasingly horrific reports from a range of
U.N. agencies and private relief organization of the plight of
children in an era of brutal civil wars, and two years of lobbying
the Security Council by the secretary-general's representative,
Olara A. Otunnu, a former diplomat and ex-president of the
International Peace Academy in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the first advocate for children was assigned to
Sierra Leone, where children as well as their parents have been
mutilated by a vicious rebel army that has also dragooned young
people into service as soldiers or virtual slaves. Two other child
advocates will take part in a peacekeeping operation in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   All three are officials from UNICEF, the U.N. children's fund.
Future appointments are to be drawn from a larger pool of eligible
child advocates from within and outside the United Nations,
including from private relief organizations, Otunnu said. All
peacekeeping operations will have one or more advisers on children.
</P>
<P>
   Otunnu, whose formal title is special representative of the
secretary-general for children and armed conflict, has insisted
that his child advocates be part of a regular peacekeeping staff
with a seat at the table of the leader, civilian or military, of
the mission in any country.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the protection and welfare of children to be taken
seriously, and not be marginalized, we must have within the central
political structure a representative, an advocate, whose charge is
making sure that the head of mission will have to coordinate these
issues,'' said Otunnu, a former foreign minister of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   He described the roles of the child protection officer as
adviser to the head of a mission, coordinator of all
child-assistance groups and strong advocate for whatever programs
are necessary to aid children, including education and relief
projects to deal with not only physical problems but also mental
trauma. Child advocates have the power to report violations against
children by U.N. troops and other officials.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, the first child advocate, Bituin Gonzales of
the Philippines, has begun to look at ways to help traumatized and
toughened former child soldiers get special educational attention.
She has also explored the use of local radio to announce and
promote her work, she said in messages to Otunnu.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Otunnu is also using electronic media to spread the
word about his projects. He has arranged videoconferencing with
schools in the metropolitan area to tell American children about
the hardships and suffering of children abroad. He said that he
hopes to set up a network of children, parents and teachers here
and abroad to keep the issue alive.
</P>
<P>
   Otunnu said that in a world of satellite television, public
opinion matters to even the roughest rebel armies, who are
circumspect in admitting to what they do to children when he meets
their leaders on his frequent trips to war zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a changing normative mood worldwide, he said. ``Some
things are unacceptable. Some things are beyond the pale. None of
these actors, whether they are insurgencies or the state, are
outside the orbit of international influence. They are all touched
in a major way by international public opinion; they feel it.
Tomorrow they know that if they want to be Mr. President or Mr.
Prime Minister at some level international acceptance and
legitimacy matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Otunnu, who has met government officials and rebel leaders
involved in wars in Sri Lanka, Somalia, Sudan, Congo, Sierra Leone
and Colombia, is struck by the dissonance between their lofty
statements of their aims and the brutality around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have a vision of a better society,'' he said. ``I
tell them, I take you at your word. But if this is you vision of
your society, how could you achieve this by what you're doing now,
by destroying the children?''
</P>
<P>
   Otunnu, who grew up in Uganda but is now a citizen of the Ivory
Coast, said that it doesn't go very far to wave international
conventions at combatants in a civil war, however important
treaties are. Those, he said, are only one of two ``pillars of
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other pillar, which we must never, ever forget, speaks
directly with a resonance to most people around the world, and that
is what is grown on the local soil,'' he said. ``We must reach out
and recognize and strengthen the traditional norms that provided
for the protection of children and women - the taboos, the
injunctions. For many of these people that grabs them, that calls
them to order.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in the society in which I grew up, not in any of the
societies I have been visiting, which have been torn asunder by
war, was war traditionally a free for all,'' he said. Chiefs,
elders and religious leaders know this, he added, and they need
support.

 &HT;    Conservative Christian votes take center stage before S.C. GOP
primary
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ As Saturday's Republican presidential
primary turns into a holy war for conservative Christian votes,
Baptist church deacon Walter Holmes figures John McCain is
benefiting from two endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   One came from Republican primary dropout Gary Bauer, the social
conservative who campaigned with McCain on Thursday, a day after
declaring him the GOP's best hope for regaining the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The other endorsement was Christian Coalition founder Pat
Robertson's backing of McCain rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes believes that endorsement will help McCain, not Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Pat Robertson is a loser in politics,'' said Holmes,
73, attending a McCain rally Thursday outside Spartanburg. ``That
could hurt Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final furious days of campaigning, McCain is counting on
such seemingly unconventional wisdom to win in South Carolina,
where the nationally waning Christian Coalition still claims strong
support.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say a victory by McCain in the neck-to-neck
primary would signal growing political diversity among South
Carolina's conservative Christians.
</P>
<P>
   It also would suggest lessening influence by the state GOP's
conservative standard-bearers, including Bush supporters such as
former Gov. Carroll Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian Coalition is not as unassailable as some people
think,'' said Laura Woliver, a University of South Carolina
political scientist. ``I think there is some splintering going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ralph Reed, former Christian Coalition president now
advising Bush, said the conservative Christian vote ``is still very
critical'' and will determine who wins the South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win only with it, but you can't win without it,''
said Dee Workman Benedict, who helped organize Steve Forbes'
campaign in South Carolina before he dropped out earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict, 54, of Greenville, now supports McCain, reflecting a
split among Forbes' former supporters in the state.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is banking on traditional support from conservative
Republicans, McCain is appealing to conservative Democrats,
independents and former supporters of Forbes and Bauer, as well as
moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of party affiliation, registered South Carolina
voters can participate in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Christians cross party lines in the state.
According to analysts, they're expected to make up a third of
Saturday's turnout.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his supporters appealed to those voters in a flurry
of stops Wednesday and Thursday in the Upstate, the buckle of South
Carolina's Bible belt.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, McCain and his wife, Cindy, accompanied state House
Speaker Pro Tem Terry Haskins to Hampton Park Baptist Church in
Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones III, president of Bob Jones University, is a member of
that church, the closest McCain came to reaching out to Jones'
influential network of alumni and other supporters.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain criticized the fundamental Christian college's ban
on interracial dating and marriage, Jones said he would not be
invited to speak on campus.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain won easily in New Hampshire's primary, Bush made
his first South Carolina campaign stop at the college. Pundits saw
it as a gamble by Bush that he would be more likely to appeal to
Christian conservatives than offend critics of the dating ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conservative Christian vote is going to be split between
Bush and McCain over social issues,'' said Haskins, 45, a
Greenville Republican who graduated from Bob Jones University in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion and other right-to-life issues have emerged as the most
volatile, with McCain supporters accusing Bush backers of
misleading negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee and its state affiliate,
South Citizens for Life, are airing radio commercials and mailing
fliers accusing McCain of voting to ''use tax dollars to pay for
experiments that use body parts from aborted babies.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups' ads and mailings also accused McCain of making
''conflicting statements'' about his stance on Roe v. Wade, the
1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are driving up McCain's negatives,'' said Holly Gatling,
executive director of South Carolina Citizens for Life.
</P>
<P>
   Haskins said McCain is being ''undermined by a systematic,
underground effort,'' including a widely distributed e-mail in
which Bob Jones University Professor Richard Hand denounced McCain
as bent on ''partying, playing, drinking and womanizing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If those things he said about John McCain were true, Gary
Bauer would not be supporting him, and neither would I,'' Haskins
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bush forces in the state have been trying to demonize
McCain, with some success, but it is starting to backfire,'' said
Benedict, the former Forbes' official.
</P>
<P>
   Haskins said Bauer's endorsement should offset criticism of
McCain as soft on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator McCain has looked me in the eye, looked the American
people in the eye, and said that he thinks Roe v. Wade was wrongly
decided,'' Bauer said during McCain's campaign stop outside of
Spartanburg. ''I take him at his word.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he plans to help McCain ''in any way I can,'' but
that he didn't think McCain's campaign would need to tap into his
fund-raising network.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not think he has a money problem, quite frankly,'' Bauer
said. ''The reaction after New Hampshire has been so dramatic, on
the Internet and otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Forbes' supporter, Christian Coalition official Bette
Cox, said she couldn't support McCain because he ''flip-flops'' on
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of Christian Coalition county chairmen are
supporting Bush,'' said Cox, 56, chairman of Florence County's
Christian Coalition and first vice president of the state
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   She said the coalition also opposed McCain's campaign reform
proposal because it would hurt fund-raising by such groups.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is so vehement in its opposition to McCain's brand
of campaign reform that the group ''overstepped the line'' in
endorsing Bush, said Lois Eargle, the coalition's chairman in
Myrtle Beach.
</P>
<P>
   She said coalition fliers have misrepresented McCain's position
on abortion. She was so disgusted by such tactics that she plans to
resign from the coalition after South Carolina's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the criticism is about campaign finance, then attack him on
campaign finance, not right to life,'' said Dan Griffith, a former
Forbes supporter who resigned last week from South Carolina
Citizens for Life.

   McCAIN-BUSH (Greenville, S.C.) _ John McCain appeals to
Democrats and independents to join Republicans to propel him to
victory in Saturday's GOP primary. Meanwhile, George W. Bush
accuses McCain of riding a ``high horse on a low road'' by
continuing to distribute a brochure that says Bush's tax cut plan
would harm Social Security. The latest polls show the two in a

NASDAQ HITS RECORD BUT `OLD ECONOMY' STOCKS GO NOWHERE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shrugging off the ever more likely prospect of
additional interest rate increases this spring, technology stocks
powered the Nasdaq market to a record Thursday as turnover surged
past 2 billion shares for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index jumped 121.27 points, or 2.74
percent, to 4,548.92.
</P>
<P>
   However, other stocks, particularly those of the so-called Old
Economy, languished once again, with the Dow Jones industrial
average losing 46.84 points, or 0.44 percent, to 10,514.57, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index barely managing to stay in
positive territory, rising 0.59, or 0.04 percent, to 1,388.26.
</P>
<P>
   The latest government report of minimal inflation spurred a
general early rally but Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, soon dampened sentiment with an unusually direct warning
that higher rates would be needed to slow an overheated economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For once, I thought I understood what he was saying _ that he
will continue to increase interest rates until job creation slows
down,'' said Robert Bloom, president of Friends, Ivory &AMP; Sime, an
investment management company. As a result, Bloom added, stocks are
now on the defensive and 2000 is ``a year to try to preserve
gains.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip index, which had been up more than 110 points,
swung to a loss of nearly 107 points at midday and then clawed back
part way in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart and other retailers were once again prominent
casualties; the giant discounter dropping 4 3/8, to 48 3/8, 31
percent below its Dec. 31 peak. Gap lost 6 7/8, to 42 1/8, and
American Eagle Outfitters 4 15/16, to 20 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were also weak, especially American Express,
which sank 5 29/32, to 147 15/16, and was the biggest factor in the
Dow's decline. Bank of New York, at the center of a
money-laundering case, fell 2 7/16, to 35 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   But technology, both in the Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell
2000 _ the latter up 1.95 percent, to a second consecutive record _
was largely untouched by concern over how hard rising rates, when
they kick in, will brake the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, introducing Windows 2000, climbed 2, to 99 5/8;
Intel, 2 13/16, to 110; Qualcomm, 8 1/8, to 130; Cisco Systems, 3
21/64, to 130 1/2; Juniper Networks, 20 3/4, to 241 1/4; and eBay 4
9/16, to 145 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick, though, skidded a second day as the online
advertising company faced a federal investigation into its
collection of data on Internet users. The shares fell 15 3/4, to 90
3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision Systems, the top operator in the New York City area,
fell 2 5/8, to 68 3/8, after reporting a widened fourth-quarter
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid, facing a fraud investigation, fell 1/2, to 6 5/8, down
from more than 45 a year ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ In a shocking development, Dale Earnhardt
ended the Twin 125 qualifying races whining instead of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's streak of 10 consecutive qualifying victories came
to an unceremonious end as he finished 11th in his heat yesterday.
The seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion claims he never had a
chance, because of Chevrolet's alleged disadvantage that is
compounded by NASCAR's new shock rule.
</P>
<P>
   Ford drivers Bill Elliott and Ricky Rudd won yesterday's races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't worried about the streak,'' Earnhardt said. ``That's
the worst racing I've seen at Daytona in a long, long time. They
took NASCAR Winston Cup racing and made it some of the sorriest
racing. They took the racing out of the drivers' and the crews'
hands. We can't adjust. We can't make our cars drive like we want.
They just killed the racing at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ``[NASCAR founder] Mr. Bill France Sr. probably rolled over in
his grave if he seen that. This is a joke to have to race like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt started ninth and moved up as high as sixth before
dropping back to 11th. He had the second-best finish among
Chevrolets in his 28-car qualifier, but in the second qualifier,
Earnhardt's teammate, Mike Skinner, finished second in a Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt will start 21st Sunday, his worst starting position in
the Daytona 500 since 1984. After NASCAR chief operating officer
Mike Helton announced that the ruling body will not implement rules
changes between now and then, Earnhardt's GM Goodwrench team
counted itself out of Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to win the Daytona 500,'' team owner Richard
Childress said, ``and we absolutely don't have a chance. No chance.
It'd be like putting my grandson in there fighting Muhammad Ali in
Ali's young days. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just disappointed they let this thing get this far out of
hand. We spend millions of dollars trying to race, and they've let
this thing get so far out of hand that the competition isn't good.
The show isn't good.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's new shock and spring rules were intended to smooth the
ride for drivers and slow the cars by eliminating custom-made
shocks at the series' restrictor-plate races. At Daytona and
Talladega, teams are required to use NASCAR-issued shocks and a
specific spring rate.
</P>
<P>
   Crew chiefs complain that the new shocks package affects their
ability to adjust their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt said he had a push in his car, because the new shocks
create an air lift in the front end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've basically got what we're dealt, and it's pretty hard to
get around it,'' said Kevin Hamlin, Earnhardt's crew chief. ``Their
cars [Fords] don't push as bad, because they have a little more
downforce in the nose it seems like. ... We're just kind of
fighting a losing battle right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt lost twice yesterday. His streak ended, and he failed
to convince NASCAR officials that rules changes are necessary for a
competitive race Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dale Earnhardt is driving the car, we've got a chance to
win anytime,'' Hamlin said. ``But he can't do but so much. We have
to give him something he can drive in. We are kind of at the end of
our barrel of tricks right now.'' nn

JEWISH CONSUL ISSUE FANS AUSTRIA DEBATE IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BENJAMIN WALLACE-WELLS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The lushly appointed downtown offices of the Austrian
consulate are open from 11-1 three days a week, but the consul
general can't see many visitors then because he is praying. And in
the reception area there is a neat array of black kippahs so
visitors can cover their heads before meeting the consul.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange twist that has drawn outrage from some local Jewish
leaders, Austria's honorary consul to New England happens to be a
rabbi and publisher of the region's leading Jewish newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Yitzchok A. Korff, a Hasidic with a congregation in Newton
who has a reputation for unorthodox political views, is the local
representative of a country whose new government has been condemned
by the United States, the European Union, Israel, and a host of
Jewish organizations worldwide for the anti-immigrant views and
past pro-Nazi comments made by one of its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Some local Jewish leaders say they can not understand how a
learned Jewish cleric could associate with a nation they believe
has not come to grips with its own Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany has gone through 55 years of very deep acknowledgement
of its history,'' said Martin Kaplan, a Boston attorney and a
nationally-known Jewish leader. ``Austria hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Korff, who also is an attorney and holds a doctorate degree
in international relations, believes it would be foolish to cut off
ties with Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``One does not educate, sensitize others to issues, or resolve
differences by removing oneself, building walls, or cutting off
communication,'' Korff said in written responses to questions
submitted by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Korff was asked by Austria's ambassador to the United States to
become honorary consul in 1987. His predecessor, Edward
Masterman,had resigned in protest when Kurt Waldheim, who served in
the Nazi party, was elected President.
</P>
<P>
   Several local Jewish leaders believe the participation of the
far-right Freedom Party in Austria's governing coalition shows the
country tolerates prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austria pretends to be the first victim of Nazi Germany when
perhaps it would be more accurate to call Austria Nazi Germany's
first collaborator,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Lawrence Lowenthal, Executive Director of the American
Jewish Committee's Boston chapter: ``To this day I don't understand
why Rabbi Korff agreed to be the Austrian consul to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   But Korff says Austria's recent behavior towards Jews,
particularly its welcoming of Jewish refugees from the former
Soviet Union, ought to weigh heavier in public opinion than events
of half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Post-war Austria has consistently and repeatedly been of
assistance and support to Jews and the Jewish community in Austria
and internationally,'' Korff said, ``from nurturing and aid to the
Austrian Jewish Community and its institutions to serving as a
welcome respite and refuge for thousands upon thousands of Jews
from the former Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union on their way to
settling in Israel, the United States, and other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sarna, chair of the Near Eastern and Judaic Studies
departments at Brandeis University, says there has been a
historically close relationship between Jews and Austria that
predates the Nazi era and which might help explain Korff's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly true that in the Austro-Hungarian empire under
(Emperor) Franz Joseph, Hasidim thrived,'' Sarna said. ``Franz
Joseph, unlike Tsar Nicholas of Russia, was seen as highly
benevolent. Long after his death, there were still Austrian Jews in
America who celebrated his birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   That Korff would be caught up in part of what has become a major
international firestorm is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   He hails from a long line of locally controversial Hasidic
rabbis. His grandfather Jacob I. Korff, worked on a proposal to
``buy'' Jews from the Nazis during the Holocaust by getting
American organizations to give money to Nazi Germany in exchange
for the safe return of Jewish concentration camp prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   His uncle, Baruch Korff, made headlines during the Watergate
crisis for defending President Nixon against calls for his
resignation.

   Y.A. Korff was a prominent Boston attorney who was married to
the daughter of Sumner Redstone, the chief executive of Viacom. But
in 1992 he divorced, reconnected with his religious roots and
became a full-time Hasidic rabbi. The Hasidim are among the most
Orthodox of Jewish denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Korff maintains that his decision to stay on as Austria's
diplomatic liaison to Boston is consistent with his own religious
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Representing Austria) is consistent with our primary calling
as rabbi and with the philosophy of open communication and outreach
that is a hallmark of our Jewish heritage,'' he said.

INDIA'S WAR GAMES HEIGHTENS TENSIONS WITH PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ More than 100 Indian tanks are churning up
billowing clouds of sand as they rumble across the Rajasthani
desert this week in war games about 60 miles from India's border
with its longtime foe Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month before President Clinton visits the region, the
Indian military's very public rehearsal of its limited-war strategy
is yet another sign of the heightened tensions between these
nuclear-armed neighbors, whose leaders have recently been speaking
about the possibility of nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is wrestling with whether Clinton
will stop in Pakistan to meet briefly with its army chief, who took
power in a coup four months ago. Fearful that India and Pakistan
are headed for more armed conflict, South Asia experts are divided
over whether a presidential visit would help rein in Pakistan's
provocative military tactics in the disputed Himalayan territory of
Kashmir or would legitimize military rule in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   At India's invitation, military attaches from 22 countries,
including the United States, have been flown to the desert this
week to watch India's exercises, which began Monday and are to end
on Saturday. Mock battles have featured offensive strikes and the
rapid deployment of the tanks, 20,000 troops and 40 fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   India's defense minister and its army chief said last month that
India must be prepared to wage an intense but limited war with
Pakistan if the need arises, even in the shadow of the nuclear
threat. Indian army officers said that this week's exercises are
not meant to be provocative, but are the kind of routine practice
that keeps their men and machines from getting rusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You train for that, you prepare for that,'' one senior officer
said in an interview at army headquarters here. ``There's nothing
aggressive about that.''
</P>
<P>
   India notified Pakistan of the exercises two weeks in advance,
but Pakistani military officials said they nonetheless see the
exercises as muscle-flexing by India. ``We are vigilant,'' Brig.
Rashid Qureshi, a spokesman for the Pakistani military, said in a
telephone interview from Rawalpindi. ``We are monitoring what
they're doing. And if it's felt that Pakistan needs to take
safeguards, I'm sure it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between India and Pakistan have been in a worsening
spiral since last summer, when Pakistani forces infiltrated
Indian-held Kashmir _ the disputed territory that Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright recently called ``the fuse'' in this
troubled relationship _ and Indian troops battled to drive them
out.
</P>
<P>
   The Dec. 24 hijacking of an Indian Airlines commercial jet _
which India claims was masterminded by Pakistani military
intelligence agents _ further deepened animosities, particularly
because the Indian government was harshly criticized at home for
freeing three jailed militants opposed to Indian rule of Kashmir to
win release of more than 150 hostages.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan, which started high-level peace talks a year
ago, broke off negotiations last summer and the gap between them
just seems to keep widening. Pakistan's military ruler, Gen.
Pervaiz Musharraf, said he wanted to meet with India's prime
minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, but only if Kashmir is the main
item on the agenda. Vajpayee said he is willing to talk to Pakistan
only if he sees evidence that it is reining in what it regards a
terrorist violence in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir, claimed by both countries, is now divided by the
so-called Line of Control into portions held by India and Pakistan.
Every few days, militants who Western intelligence analysts say are
supported by Pakistan kill a few Indian soldiers or security agents
in Indian-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, which followed India in testing nuclear weapons in May
1998, has been unwilling to promise that it will not use nuclear
weapons first. It is far smaller than India and has weaker
conventional forces.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview with Doordarshan, India's state television
station, taped on Feb. 4 and broadcast Feb. 7, Musharraf said
nuclear weapons should not be used but raised the possibility that
they would be used if Pakistan's ``national integrity is
threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say there are chances,'' he said. ``If at all India
escalates on the Line of Control in Kashmir, there can be
chances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, who usually speaks in measured phrases, spoke harshly
on Feb. 6 at a memorial for Indian soldiers killed last summer in
Kashmir, saying that India would strike back if Pakistan hit first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan is threatening a nuclear war, but do they even know
what it means?'' he said. ``They think they will drop one bomb and
they'll win and we'll lose. This won't happen. We have said we
won't be the first to use nuclear weapons, but if anyone uses them
against us, we will not wait for our annihilation.''
</P>
<P>
   India's strategy since the hijacking ended on Dec. 31 has been
to isolate Pakistan. It has argued vehemently that the United
States should declare Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism. And
officials here have made it clear that they do not want Clinton to
visit Pakistan or to try to inject himself into efforts to resolve
India's differences with Pakistan over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to expressions of alarm in Washington about the state
of relations between India and Pakistan, Vajpayee last week
categorically stated that no other country would be allowed ``to
meddle in our bilateral relations or problems.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an interview published Thursday in the French daily Le
Figaro, Vajpayee advised President Clinton to skip Pakistan. He was
quoted as saying ``a visit to Pakistan while this country is under
military dictatorship and sponsors Islamic terrorism around the
world would be very badly received by Indian public opinion.''

COMMENTARY: WHO WANTS TO BE A VOTER? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Station WTAT-TV scored a big coup on the
evening news this week when its resident psychic announced the
winner of the upcoming presidential primary. Somewhere between a
story about a fire and a report on child molestation, Lou Wright
(``Elvis' personal psychic'') took viewer calls and delivered
predictions about financial windfalls and the imminent arrival of
curly-haired suitors before raising her thumbs and revealing that
``it's McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an excellent example of the Fox Network approach to news
gathering _ low-cost, to the point and celebrity-related. After
all, if you want people to pay attention to public affairs, you
need creative packaging. This is the same theory that persuaded a
TV station in Russia to have its newscaster do a striptease while
she read the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But in South Carolina, we are once again discovering that what
American voters actually want is real elections, with decent
candidates and competition and a chance to influence the outcome.
People here are so stunned and excited about their primary, you'd
think it involved the Nasdaq, or women vying for the right to marry
a total stranger on network television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics isn't usually a hot-button issue in this market,''
said Don Feldman, the WTAT news director, between attempts to
explain that Wright is not a central feature in his operation.
``I've never seen this much interest.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is the hot ticket of the moment, but he's relatively
unchanged by his celebrity. For better or worse, he's set in his
ways, with three basic notes _ ironic humor, intense sincerity and
a fumbling, testy evasion that comes up whenever he's feeling
cornered. When he started running for president, McCain had a stump
speech he delivered so badly the staff couldn't find any good
moments to put in the TV ads. But now he basically gives a
collection of his answers to the questions he heard in New
Hampshire, and it works pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, however, is adaptive as all get-out, and since
his New Hampshire debacle he's taken on McCain's coloration. He now
promises audiences never to tell a lie, talks about campaign
finance reform and portrays himself as the anti-establishment
outsider, an especially tricky move for a candidate seen so
frequently in the company of Strom Thurmond. ``I just want to
remind you I'm a person who's coming in with a record of reform,''
he told a crowd in Beaufort, in case they had not noticed the huge
``REFORMER WITH RESULTS'' banner hanging behind him. He even
casually mentions that he once flew jets for the Air Force,
although failing to add that said flying occurred in the Texas
National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   He has taken up McCain's town-meeting format with a vengeance,
and is actually very good at it, sounding more human and
unprogrammed. ``I don't know about the South Carolina lynching
law,'' he told a woman who asked a rather incoherent question about
racial issues. ``But I can't imagine it's a good law, so I don't
support it if it is a law.''
</P>
<P>
   After all this mutation, the one clear distinction that voters
can still grab hold of is taxes, where Bush favors a huge,
Reaganesque cut that gives big breaks to the wealthy. But the
voters seem to prefer McCain's more modest program targeted toward
the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Bush is painting himself as a profile in courage, a
man driven by principle to force a huge tax break down the
electorate's throat. ``They say the polls don't show people want a
tax cut,'' he told a well-heeled crowd in Hilton Head. ``I don't
care about the polls. I care about what's right.'' Since Bush never
refers to the wealthy as the wealthy (think ``entrepreneur'') he
can describe his tax break for rich people in terms that make him
sound like Pitchfork Ben Tillman. ``Cut taxes for everyone! Not the
favored few!'' he cried to a blue-collar crowd at a Beaufort youth
center. The audience responded enthusiastically, possibly unaware
they were the ``favored few'' in question.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush doesn't win on Saturday, I foresee him campaigning in
the Michigan primary with a comb-over of thinning gray hair. He
will take questions for seven or eight hours every night, and then
invite voters to watch him flog the Republican congressional
leadership at a pillar.

JEWISH CONSUL ISSUE FANS AUSTRIA DEBATE IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BENJAMIN WALLACE-WELLS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The lushly appointed downtown offices of the Austrian
consulate are open from 11-1 three days a week, but the consul
general can't see many visitors then because he is praying. And in
the reception area there is a neat array of black kippahs so
visitors can cover their heads before meeting the consul.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange twist that has drawn outrage from some local Jewish
leaders, Austria's honorary consul to New England happens to be a
rabbi and publisher of the region's leading Jewish newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Yitzchok A. Korff, a Hasidic with a congregation in Newton
who has a reputation for unorthodox political views, is the local
representative of a country whose new government has been condemned
by the United States, the European Union, Israel, and a host of
Jewish organizations worldwide for the anti-immigrant views and
past pro-Nazi comments made by one of its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Some local Jewish leaders say they can not understand how a
learned Jewish cleric could associate with a nation they believe
has not come to grips with its own Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany has gone through 55 years of very deep acknowledgement
of its history,'' said Martin Kaplan, a Boston attorney and a
nationally-known Jewish leader. ``Austria hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Korff, who also is an attorney and holds a doctorate degree
in international relations, believes it would be foolish to cut off
ties with Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``One does not educate, sensitize others to issues, or resolve
differences by removing oneself, building walls, or cutting off
communication,'' Korff said in written responses to questions
submitted by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Korff was asked by Austria's ambassador to the United States to
become honorary consul in 1987. His predecessor, Edward
Masterman,had resigned in protest when Kurt Waldheim, who served in
the Nazi party, was elected President.
</P>
<P>
   Several local Jewish leaders believe the participation of the
far-right Freedom Party in Austria's governing coalition shows the
country tolerates prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austria pretends to be the first victim of Nazi Germany when
perhaps it would be more accurate to call Austria Nazi Germany's
first collaborator,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Lawrence Lowenthal, Executive Director of the American
Jewish Committee's Boston chapter: ``To this day I don't understand
why Rabbi Korff agreed to be the Austrian consul to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   But Korff says Austria's recent behavior towards Jews,
particularly its welcoming of Jewish refugees from the former
Soviet Union, ought to weigh heavier in public opinion than events
of half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Post-war Austria has consistently and repeatedly been of
assistance and support to Jews and the Jewish community in Austria
and internationally,'' Korff said, ``from nurturing and aid to the
Austrian Jewish Community and its institutions to serving as a
welcome respite and refuge for thousands upon thousands of Jews
from the former Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union on their way to
settling in Israel, the United States, and other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sarna, chair of the Near Eastern and Judaic Studies
departments at Brandeis University, says there has been a
historically close relationship between Jews and Austria that
predates the Nazi era and which might help explain Korff's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly true that in the Austro-Hungarian empire under
(Emperor) Franz Joseph, Hasidim thrived,'' Sarna said. ``Franz
Joseph, unlike Tsar Nicholas of Russia, was seen as highly
benevolent. Long after his death, there were still Austrian Jews in
America who celebrated his birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   That Korff would be caught up in part of what has become a major
international firestorm is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   He hails from a long line of locally controversial Hasidic
rabbis. His grandfather Jacob I. Korff, worked on a proposal to
``buy'' Jews from the Nazis during the Holocaust by getting
American organizations to give money to Nazi Germany in exchange
for the safe return of Jewish concentration camp prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   His uncle, Baruch Korff, made headlines during the Watergate
crisis for defending President Nixon against calls for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Y.A. Korff was a prominent Boston attorney who was married to
the daughter of Sumner Redstone, the chief executive of Viacom. But
in 1992 he divorced, reconnected with his religious roots and
became a full-time Hasidic rabbi. The Hasidim are among the most
Orthodox of Jewish denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Korff maintains that his decision to stay on as Austria's
diplomatic liaison to Boston is consistent with his own religious
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Representing Austria) is consistent with our primary calling
as rabbi and with the philosophy of open communication and outreach
that is a hallmark of our Jewish heritage,'' he said.

 HORSE RACING REPORT-TEX 
Derby bets starting to come earlier 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe some people will argue that horse racing isn't a sport _
or not much of one compared to football, basketball or baseball _
but anyone who has handicapped a race knows there aren't many games
as great as this one.
</P>
<P>
   We know this to be true because it's a lot easier to regain your
temper while tearing up a losing mutuel ticket than it is after you
tried to wrap a 5-iron around a tree trunk. And there's a remote
chance that you can outsmart your 8 year old at the track but never
at his home computer game.
</P>
<P>
   The horse racing game is great, and it gets better at this time
of year. Believe it or not, there are a few imaginative types
involved in horse racing. They are the ones who presented the
Kentucky Derby Future Wager last year.
</P>
<P>
   Another round of investing in largely unproven 3 year olds
started when this year's Future Wager started yesterday at Lone
Star Park at Grand Prairie and racetracks in more than 20 other
states.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're spending any amount of time in the Cincinnati
area, you can play the ``Road to the Derby Challenge'' at Turfway
Park. It really took a lot of imagination to figure this one out:
Guess the winners of 23 key Kentucky Derby prep races and the
winner gets $5,000, second place a trip to the Belmont Stakes and
third place a trip to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Someone ought to do some skull work on this one and figure out a
way to put it on the Internet, or at the hometown racetrack at
least, so everyone can play.
</P>
<P>
   These games add to the interest in the Triple Crown series.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of waiting for the major prep races to find the
contenders and waiting for the Derby to talk about them,
handicappers are searching out maiden races and allowance events to
find live horses even before the prep races start.
</P>
<P>
   Those imaginative guys with the Derby Future Wager ought to do
the same thing. There are at least three horses that will be a drag
to this wagering pool.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Chief Seattle ought not to worry if he can make it
to the Derby: He has to make it out of Dubai first. Mull Of Kintyre
only has raced in the United States once. Scottish Halo is trying
to stay sound and still hasn't raced this year.
</P>
<P>
   Horses such as Country Only (winner of the Whirlaway at
Aqueduct), Un Fino Vino (an honest, if unsensational type who's an
allowance winner at Gulfstream) and either Rupert Herd or
Grundlefoot (they race at Gulfstream tomorrow) would be more
compelling betting interests at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe people thought that the person who paid for the $10,000
bet on the field in the opening moments of the Future Wager last
year was a knucklehead, beating down his odds before things got
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   But the only knuckleheads turned out to be the rest of us who
could not figure out the math and see that a group of more than 300
horses in the field was a big overlay against 23
moderately-talented horses listed as individual betting interests
in each of the pools.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on the field being overlooked again this year.
LONE STAR RECRUITS
</P>
<P>
   Applications for stalls at the Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie
thoroughbred season are not due until March 1, but it looks if
there is plenty of interest despite competition from the re-opening
of Arlington International Racecourse. Jeanette Hughes, Lone Star's
assistant racing secretary, said she expects requests for a full
allotment from trainers Steve Asmussen (defending champion trainer
at Lone Star), Mike Stidham (current leader at Fair Grounds) and
Cole Norman (defending champ at Louisiana Downs).
</P>
<P>
   Hughes also said Mike Pegram, owner of Real Quiet,
Silverbulletday and Captain Steve, could have at least 10
``second-string'' horses stabled at Lone Star in the name of
trainer Mike Puhich. Hughes said she has not been contacted by Hall
of Fame trainer Jack Van Berg, who indicated interest last year in
coming to Lone Star. RISEN STAR PROBABLES
</P>
<P>
   Fair Grounds stakes coordinator Brent Seward said the field for
Sunday's $125,000 Risen Star Stakes could include Exchange Rate,
Snuck In, Proper Man, Ifitstobeitsuptome, Doctor Mike and Peninsula
in addition to LeComte Stakes 1-2 finishers Noble Ruler and Mighty.
</P>
<P>
   Chilukki, last year's champion 2-year-old filly for owner Bob
and Janice McNair of Houston, is expected to make her debut as a 3
year old tomorrow in the Grade III Davona Dale Stakes at Fair
Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The $500,000 New Orleans Handicap on March 5 could attract
either Behrens or Pleasant Breeze, Elaborate, Ecton Park,
Temperance Time and Allen's Oop. $51K BET THIS TIME
</P>
<P>
   The publicity office at Churchill Downs said that the same
person who paid for a $10,000 bet on the field on opening day of
the Kentucky Derby Future Wager last year at Lone Star Park at
Grand Prairie made a $51,000 bet on the Derby Future field
yesterday at Churchill's Sports Spectrum in Louisville, Ky. An
independent source confirmed it was the same person.
</P>
<P>
   The gambler told track officials he did not wish to be
identified. If it's the same person _ sources identify him as a
professional horseplayer based in Las Vegas _ he took all his
winnings and let it ride. His $10,000 investment last year and
winnings totaled $51,000. DUBAI OBSTACLE MOVED REAL QUIET TO THE
FARM
</P>
<P>
   The decision this week to retire 1998 Kentucky Derby champion
Real Quiet is not because he's injured and can't race again. It's
simply another situation which made more economic sense for his
owners to send him to the breeding shed rather than keep him at the
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet recovered from a leg injury he suffered last year,
and he exercised the past month over the track in Southern
California. He was sound, but he wasn't progressing in his fitness
quickly enough to make the trip overseas for the Dubai World Cup on
March 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``That softened me up right there,'' owner Mike Pegram said.
``You're missing out on a $6 million race.''
</P>
<P>
   So rather than chase after smaller races and have no cinch of
winning substantial purse money, Pegram agreed to the retirement in
which Real Quiet can generate more than $2 million guaranteed this
year through breeding rights. Real Quiet is at the new Vinery Farm
located outside of Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   As for one of his other high-profile horses, Pegram said he
would entertain the thought of one day breeding Silverbulletday
(she's by the Deputy Minister stallion Silver Deputy and out of a
Tom Rolfe mare) to Real Quiet (by the Fappiano horse Quiet American
and out of a Believe It mare).
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I can get another couple of years of enjoyment out
of Silverbulletday at the races before she's retired,'' Pegram
said, adding that there's a remote chance she will return to the
races in the $500,000 Apple Blossom Handicap on April 9 at Oaklawn
Park before running in the $250,000 Louisville Breeders' Cup
Handicap on Kentucky Oaks Day at Churchill Downs. nn

BRITISH ENVOY TO ULSTER STYMIED OVER STALEMATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Peter Mandelson, the secretary of state for Northern
Ireland, is praised as brilliant, panned as vainglorious, and
regarded by admirers and critics alike as one of Britain's most
effective politicians, but even he seemed at a loss Thursday as he
pondered how to break the latest stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he proposed to rescue a process that has ground to a
halt, yet again, over the vexing question of what to do with the
Irish Republican Army's hidden arsenal, Mandelson shook his head
and replied candidly, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his office here, above the River Thames,
Mandelson admitted he had no plan to persuade the IRA to make a
firm commitment to disarm or persuade the Ulster Unionists to drop
their insistence on it. But he said that unless a way was found
around the impasse in the next two or three weeks, the political
vacuum could be filled by extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people need to draw a breath. But if we allow this
stalemate to drift on, it will deteriorate,'' he said.
``Hard-liners on both sides will be emboldened.''
</P>
<P>
   While some have suggested ditching Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the IRA, and trying to move the process forward without the
republican movement, Mandelson dismissed that idea outright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's realistic,'' he said when asked if Sinn
Fein could be excluded if there is no progress on IRA disarmament.
``The great thing about the (Northern Ireland) assembly is that
it's inclusive. That's the only way this is going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has he considered asking the White House to bar Sinn Fein
officials from traveling to the United States, as some have called
for, a sanction that could damage Sinn Fein's fundraising and its
newfound status as a mainstream political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a matter for the US administration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate British political operative, Mandelson has met his
match in trying to keep the peace process on the rails. While both
loved and loathed, he is universally respected for his political
skills, which some have described as visionary, others as
Machiavellian.
</P>
<P>
   He may be Prime Minister Tony Blair's most valued cabinet
member, having orchestrated the British Labor Party's landslide
victory in 1997 by marginalizing the party's socialist left wing
and compromising on longheld principles to gain power. So
indispensable is he considered by Blair that Mandelson spent less
than a year in the wilderness after he was forced to resign as the
cabinet's trade secretary in December 1998 for taking a personal
loan from a man whose business his office was supposed to monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Mandelson took over the Northern Ireland portfolio
from Mo Mowlam, the most popular member of Blair's cabinet. While
some say Mowlam was dumped for refusing to take a transfer a few
months before, and because unionists in Northern Ireland had no
faith in her, Blair's aides say Mandelson was brought in because
his considerable political skills were needed to get the Good
Friday Agreement of 1998 fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   But last Friday, in what was the biggest and most scrutinized
decision of his political career, Mandelson pulled the plug on the
power-sharing assembly that was the cornerstone of the new
political institutions that are supposed to transform Northern
Ireland into an equitable, stable, peaceful democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish government said it believed a last-minute pledge from
the IRA to eventually put its weapons ``beyond use'' was enough of
a concession to avert a suspension. Mandelson, however, said the
IRA's pledge was too vague to prevent the Ulster Unionists, who
represent most Protestants, from walking out, collapsing the
assembly. He said Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble's position
was untenable. For Mandelson, suspension was the least worst
option.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had not done as I did, we would not have institutions
worth reviving,'' he said. ``The cross-community support would have
collapsed. Trimble would have resigned, or he would have been
sacked. What the IRA said was a significant change, but it was not
a sea change.''
</P>
<P>
   His decision led the IRA to break off contact with the
international commission overseeing the disarming of paramilitary
groups, and led to charges that he was taking the unionist side,
abandoning Britain's role as honest broker in Northern Ireland,
where it insists it has no economic, military, or strategic
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Even the liberal British press has accused Mandelson of adopting
the unionist line. Mandelson denies he is biased toward unionists,
and privately, British officials insist the Irish position is
closer to Mandelson's, but that they understand the Irish have to
play to a constituency that does not want to see its government
unquestioningly following the British line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Irish share the same analysis,'' said a senior British
official. ``We created the breathing space so the Irish government
could work with Sinn Fein to get a change of heart on the IRA's
part. Because of the Irish government's work, the IRA did move, but
they did not move enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said he has resigned himself to the attacks that have
followed his decision to suspend the power-sharing assembly..
</P>
<P>
   ``As secretary of state, I know that I earn my salary by
spending half my time as a punch bag and the other half as a
scapegoat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is also resigned to how much he can do to bridge the yawning
gap of mistrust between unionists and republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can encourage, cajole, facilitate, and occasionally punish,
but I can't force them to do anything. I can't force the unionists
to stay in the assembly, as some have suggested,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As they try to find a way out of the impasse, some have urged
the British government to negotiate directly with the IRA. But a
senior British official said that London officials were told by
Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, that the IRA would
not discuss disarming with the British ``in a million years.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the IRA would ever disarm, Mandelson said,
``I don't know. And that is the problem.''

battle, George W. Bush uses the sobriquet ``The Chairman'' to tar
John McCain as a Washington insider. But a close examination of
McCain's record as chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce
Committee shows that he defies easy labeling. He has angered and

COMMENTARY: MY KINDA TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Replace double parentheses (()) with brackets.) 
(jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boy, I feel better now. The leading Internet execs met with the
president at the White House Tuesday and they all agreed that
despite the recent hacker attacks that disrupted major Web sites,
there was no need for any government regulation or taxation of
cyberspace. When George W. Bush and John McCain were asked about
this they both said: Hands off the Net _ we've got to nurture this
new baby. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I agree. In fact I think this hands-off approach is such a good
idea I and my neighbors are trying it in our town. Why should
cyberspace have all the fun? We formed ``the Bethesda
Government-Free and Tax-Free Zone.'' It includes everyone who lives
in a very distinct space _ the 20817 ZIP code _ and here's what
happened: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, we got our congresswoman to arrange a three-year
moratorium on any taxation, police or government regulation in the
20817 area. This has already paid enormous dividends. Because
Montgomery Mall shopping center, the main mall in Bethesda, doesn't
have to charge sales tax anymore, we now have people coming from
Virginia, Baltimore, even Philadelphia, just to shop there.
</P>
<P>
   All the e-commerce retailers, like Buy.com, are complaining to
the federal government about the fact that neither Montgomery Mall
nor any of the stores in Bethesda have to charge sales tax so
people can just shop there tax-free _ while the e-commerce
retailers have to pay UPS and FedEx to deliver their goods to your
door. But our mayor, who gets paid in stock options instead of from
tax revenues, told the dot-coms: ``Too bad. We've got an experiment
going in Bethesda and we're gonna nurture it. So keep your hands
off.`` &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing we Bethesdans have had to get used to is the
fact that when we declared our government-free zone, window shades
were banned. So now all kinds of people passing by your house can
peer in and see your eating habits, shopping habits, sexual
predilections, and then sell that information to marketing
companies, unimpeded. When people asked why they couldn't have
window shades in Bethesda, the companies, who benefit most from
this, said, ``That's just how it is and that's how it always must
be. No one created Bethesda. It just happened. So get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But we tell everyone who wants to move here: Don't worry. We're
a self-regulating community. Your private information is safe with
us. You don't need any government here. Our motto is:
``Suburbanites Just Wanna Be Free.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We also tell them that although companies dominate here, we
never have to worry about being overwhelmed by advertisers.
Precisely because firms can peer into our houses unimpeded, and
they know exactly what all our personal habits are, we only receive
advertising tailored exactly to our desires. There's no more junk
mail. Our companies know from examining our credit-card slips
exactly which car we are likely to buy next and where we are most
likely to vacation, and they get exactly the right marketer to our
doors.
</P>
<P>
   You can't imagine the creative new businesses our little
government-free zone has nurtured. Some guy even wrote about one of
our start-ups in The New York Times: It sells $1 bills for 90
cents. It's called IOU. It hasn't made money yet, but you should
see its market cap! You need a special place to nurture innovative
firms like that.
</P>
<P>
   Now people do ask whether it isn't sort of scary living in a
distinct place with no government, but we tell them that rules and
regulations will just emerge in Bethesda spontaneously from among
the citizens. We're all good people here. Pioneers, actually. No
one wears a suit or tie. Sure, occasionally someone abuses your
freedom _ reading your mail, libeling you or spreading scurrilous
rumors like McDonald's uses mad-cow beef for its burgers. But
that's life on the frontier. If you don't like it, move to Chevy
Chase. Because if you regulate us, or tax us, you'll kill us. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Commerce Secretary William Daley agrees. Tuesday he said,
``It is not about the government regulating this or taking steps or
actions that would at all impede ((Bethesda)), because, of course,
((Bethesda)) is the dynamic engine that is driving our economy
today and we must keep that open.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we've been so successful, we've thought of changing our
name. Got to get away from the name Bethesda. Sounds too old. Comes
from the Bible. I've thought of something more exotic. Maybe
``Amazon'' or ``Yahoo.'' But my wife says we should go for
something big and techie-sounding, something like ``The Internet.''

 &HT;    Survey: Bushs' place in polls uncertain
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARREN, Mich. _ Former President George Bush campaigned in
Michigan on Thursday for his son George W. Bush as a new poll
showed the Texas governor leading Arizona Sen. John McCain among
Republican voters, but trailing when Democrats and independents are
included.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, released by WDIV-TV of Detroit, showed Bush leading 53
percent to 35 percent when only likely Republican voters were
counted.
</P>
<P>
   However, among all likely voters in next Tuesday's Republican
presidential primary, McCain held a 46 percent to 38 percent lead.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and independents can vote in Michigan's primary, as
they can Saturday in South Carolina and as they did earlier in New
Hampshire, where McCain defeated Bush by 18 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The survey included 500 people statewide and has a margin of
error of 4.5 percent, WDIV officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush received a hero's welcome here at the
Ukrainian Cultural Center in Warren, just northeast of Detroit,
where a crowd of 200 turned out.
</P>
<P>
   He also made campaign stops in Wayne, another Detroit suburb,
and in Flint, 60 miles north of here, the city where General Motors
was born. Today, he is to campaign in Midland.
</P>
<P>
   While not directly knocking McCain, the former president said it
is his son who, as governor of Texas, has been the real reformer in
a wide array of areas including juvenile justice, education, taxes
and tort reform.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush told the crowd the Michigan primary is
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our son is involved against a good man in a very close race,
but I believe if he can come in, with your support, into Michigan
next Tuesday and win, I would think that that would guarantee that
George W. Bush would be the next Republican nominee for
president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warren is in the center of Macomb County, a primary location of
the so-called ``Reagan Democrats'' who helped Republican Ronald
Reagan win two terms as president and Bush win in 1988 before he
lost to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992.

 &HT;    Riveting performances transcend painful story of `Boys'
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny both earned
well-deserved Academy Award nominations this week for their
performances in Kimberly Peirce's riveting true-life drama, ``Boys
Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Swank is considered the favorite for the best actress Oscar,
having won the lion's share of critics prizes and a Golden Globe
Award for her convincing turn as Brandon Teena, a woman who lived
her brief life as a man.
</P>
<P>
   Peirce's feature debut was passed over for best picture and
director nominations, presumably because the heavy drama was too
tough for Academy voters. Granted, the brutal climax is difficult
to endure, but ``Boys Don't Cry'' is one of the year's most
powerful and unforgettable films.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``In Cold Blood,'' ``Badlands'' and ``The Executioner's
Song,'' from which Peirce drew inspiration, it's a fact-based tale
of murder involving young drifters in the rural Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Teena was born Teena Brandon in Lincoln, Neb. She does
not consider herself a lesbian, although her sexual desire is
directed at other women. Saving her money for a sex-change
operation, Teena cuts her hair short, stuffs a sock down her jeans
and effectively passes herself off as a handsome, charismatic young
man named Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   Exposed in Lincoln, where he awaits a court date for forgery and
theft, Brandon makes his way to the small town of Falls City. There
he finds the love and acceptance he seeks, albeit unwitting, from a
rough but endearing group of new friends.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-partying crew includes ex-cons John Lotter (Peter
Sarsgaard) and Thomas Nissen (Brendan Sexton III) and blue-collar
beauty Lana Tisdel (Sevigny).
</P>
<P>
   Peirce warmly depicts Brandon's bonding with the group, which
includes drunken ``bumper skiing'' on the back of a speeding pickup
truck, as well as his tender courtship of Lana. A rivalry for
Lana's affection develops between Brandon and John _ who is
gradually revealed to be crazy and dangerous, as is his sidekick
Tom.
</P>
<P>
   We come to care deeply for these authentically drawn characters,
which makes the tragic and inevitable unraveling of Brandon's
double life all the more heart-rending.
</P>
<P>
   Peirce spent five years investigating the story, which was also
the subject of an award-winning 1998 documentary, ``The Brandon
Teena Story.'' Her emotionally complex drama explores the nature of
identity, as well as her subject's confused and fascinating life.
</P>
<P>
   The film is sharply photographed and makes strong use of its
soundtrack, which includes the Cure song that inspired its title.
</P>
<P>
   Swank, who starred in ``The Next Karate Kid'' and did a stint on
``Beverly Hills, 90210,'' gives an astonishing performance _ often
making you forget that her character is really a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Sevigny (``The Last Days of Disco'') is outstanding in the
difficult role of Brandon's devoted girlfriend. Sarsgaard (``The
Man in the Iron Mask'') and Sexton (``Welcome to the Dollhouse'')
are frighteningly accurate in their portrayal of the brutish
rednecks.
</P>
<P>
   Gripping, poignant and sometimes painful to watch, ``Boys Don't
Cry'' is a great film.

HONORING A HERETIC WHOM VATICAN `REGRETS' BURNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ In 1992, 359 years after condemning Galileo as a heretic,
the Vatican apologized and admitted the astronomer had a point. So
far, however, the Roman Catholic Church is holding the line on
Giordano Bruno, a rationalist philosopher who was burned at the
stake for heresy 400 years ago Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has marked this Holy Year as a time for the
church to apologize for past errors and excesses, from the
Inquisition to the persecution of Jews. Thursday, Cardinal Angelo
Sodano, the Vatican secretary of state, said the church
``regretted'' that it had resorted to violence in Bruno's case, but
pointed out that Bruno's writing was ``incompatible'' with
Christian thinking, and that he therefore remains a heretic.
</P>
<P>
   And that was a great relief to hundreds of Italian atheists,
anti-clerics and freethinkers who gathered Thursday at the Giordano
Bruno statue on Campo dei Fiori, the small piazza in central Rome
where he was burned alive, to protest against the papacy and
commemorate the man many Italians revere as a martyr of free
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have this kind of demonstration if he were not a
heretic,'' said Giuseppe Martelli, a teacher and labor union
organizer who wore a black robe and hood to impersonate a
``confortatore,'' the church-assigned comforters who accompanied
the condemned man to execution, seeking to extract a last-minute
repentance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was no way the church could lift the heretic
label,'' Martelli explained gleefully. ``Bruno contested the Virgin
Mary and said Jesus was a wizard.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo dei Fiori, which is normally an expensive outdoor food
market, Thursday turned into an Italian version of Speaker's Corner
in Hyde Park in London. The base of Bruno's statue was piled with
wreaths and pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers had strung up huge banners across the piazza
declaring it a ``Zona Dewoytilizzata,'' using John Paul II's Polish
surname to mark a Pope-Free Zone. Among those in attendance were
groups such as the newspaper Wobbly Union, the World Pantheist
Association, the Italian Union of Rationalist Atheists and
Agnostics and a cell of ``Anarchocyclists.''
</P>
<P>
   Giordano Bruno, a Dominican priest whose scientific inquiries
led him to argue that the universe was infinite and that Catholic
teaching was irrational, is a symbol of stubborn defiance in a
society better known for its conformity. Even Galileo, threatened
with excommunication and death, eventually caved in and recanted.
Savonarola, another Dominican who was also burned at the stake in
1498, was a religious zealot who believed the church was too
materialistic and lax.
</P>
<P>
   Savonarola is now under consideration for sainthood. Bruno, on
the other hand, went out of his way to insult and defy church
authorities, and refused to recant to save his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bruno mainly appeals to a small minority, Italians who
are at the margins of society,'' said Paolo Fabbri, a professor of
semiotics at the University of Bologna. ``Ours is such a transigent
culture, we are known for `transformismo,' going along to get
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the anniversary of Bruno's death in 1600, which was also a
Holy Year, has unleashed a flurry of interest in him, with
newspaper special sections, conferences, and film festivals all
over Italy. In Naples, this week, the Thomas Aquinas Theological
Faculty of Southern Italy, organized a conference on Bruno,
``Beyond the Myth and Opposing Passions.'' In Rome, there was a
four-day international conference on ``Giordano Bruno and the New
Science.''
</P>
<P>
   In La Repubblica on Thursday, the paid death notices column
included three tributes to Bruno, including one that paid homage to
Bruno alongside Joan of Arc, Galileo, the film director Pier Paolo
Pasolini, ``and all freethinkers, not forgiving their
persecutors.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno, who lectured throughout Europe and briefly embraced
Calvinism and Lutheranism (both Protestant denominations later
expelled him for disrespect and insolence), also enjoyed the favor
of the court of Queen Elizabeth I, but alienated Oxford dons.
However thorny his personality, he was, in many ways, a Renaissance
man, equally comfortable in the worlds of theater, philosophy and
science.
</P>
<P>
   He became a more modern symbol of rebellion during the 19th
century, when Italy was unified, anti-clericalism flared and the
papacy was stripped of much of its secular power. His statue was
erected in Campo dei Fiori in 1887, a gesture that so infuriated
the Vatican that in the late 1920s it lobbied Mussolini for its
removal. Mussolini declined, which may help explain why Roberto
Bellarmino, the Jesuit cardinal who conducted trials against Bruno
and Galileo, was canonized in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary Italians, however, have only a sketchy
recollection of Bruno and what he stood for. Il Messaggero, a Rome
daily, conducted a survey of Campo dei Fiori, and found mostly
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Sandro Corsetti, who grew up near the piazza, told the
newspaper, ``I just know that Bruno was a serious thing, so serious
they burned him.''

FOR GUY WATERMAN, DYING ON A MOUNTAINTOP WAS RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST CORINTH, VT._ At 8:30 a.m. on Feb. 6, Guy Waterman said
goodbye to his wife of 30 years, drove his Subaru Impreza 50 miles
east to the base of Mount Lafayette, climbed to the summit, then
sat down and intentionally froze to death.
</P>
<P>
   Waterman authored four books that focused on the White
Mountains, and had climbed all 48 of New Hampshire's 4,000-foot
peaks _ in the winter, off trail, and from all four sides. So the
precision with which the 67-year-old directed friends to retrieve
his body came easily.
</P>
<P>
   A meticulous planner who had been a speechwriter for three
future presidents, Waterman had timed the mailing of his detailed
suicide letter so that his friends would receive it after his
death.
</P>
<P>
   His meticulousness did not end there. His memorial service
Thursday, for which more than 200 people crowded into the cozy
Congregational Church here, was testament to planning ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Recordings of Waterman performing ``Meet Me Tonight in
Dreamland'' and other waltzes on his piano played from a cassette
player on the altar. Friends read a selection of his favorite
poems, including John Milton Poem ``Song on May Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   As friends and family did their best to go along with his
instructions Thursday, they strained to figure out why he did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great capacity to suffer,'' said friend Tek Tomlinson
after the service. Though Waterman had never gotten over the deaths
of two of his sons in the 1970s, Tomlinson said, he had been
happier recently. ``He decided to stop when life was at its best,
and he could not see himself getting old.''
</P>
<P>
   That interpretation was echoed by Waterman's second wife, Laura,
who also was his partner in four books and the thousand climbs they
made together. ``Guy was never one to hang onto things he believed
he was finished with,'' she said. ``He believed in getting out when
things were going well.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura, 60, said she does not pretend to understand the depth of
inner pain that pushed him to death, but added that for more than a
year, she knew it was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't agree with him, but I can respect and love him as an
individual,'' she said, her love for him great enough to not stand
in his way. ``He wanted out. And his chose the way he felt was
appropriate for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Waterman's is a story of someone who never believed
he had accomplished enough, a man who always wondered if he could
have done more to prevent the loss of two sons, a man who _ despite
a twinkling eye and boisterous laugh _ had a deep fear of aging. He
hid his gloomy side well.
</P>
<P>
   Asking for emotional help would have been as foreign to the
inveterate climber as asking someone to carry his backpack.
</P>
<P>
   But friends say his story also celebrates the unbreakable bond
between a man and the mountains, and the love he had for his wife
and the friends who inherited the sad, final honor one week ago of
retrieving from the summit his snow-dusted body.
</P>
<P>
   ``His tradition was to leave no mark of passage on a trail,''
Art Kirn, a friend, told mourners at Thursday's funeral. So it
could be said of Mount Lafayette, where Waterman left only
footprints.
</P>
<P>
   He was born to privilege, the son of the late Alan Waterman,
founder of the National Science Foundation and the proud holder of
a Maine backwoods guide certificate. On vacations from private
schools, the father and son frequently visited the New England
wilderness to canoe and hike.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before entering George Washington University, Guy made a
very big mistake, according to Mike Young, a longtime hiking
friend. Against his father's wishes, Waterman fell in love, eloped
and became a father _ of three sons by the time he graduated Phi
Beta Kappa from college. He divorced his first wife in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The death of one son and the disappearance of a second, are
chronicled in Jon Krakauer's book, ``Into The Wild.'' Citing an
unnamed source, Krakauer claims the boys were estranged from their
father. Laura says this was untrue. But Krakauer did have the
bizarre circumstances of their tales correct, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Son William posted an enigmatic letter to his father in 1973
saying he was going on an extended trip, and has never been heard
from since and is presumed dead. Son Johnny, suffering from mental
illness, died in 1978 while trying to climb Mount McKinley in
Alaska with absurdly minimal provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy never really recovered, although he seldom talked about
those deaths,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   By night, Waterman played jazz in Washington nightclubs. By day,
he pursued a career as speechwriter for Dwight Eisenhower, Richard
Nixon and Gerald Ford during their presidential campaigns. In the
late 1960s he moved to Manhattan to become a vice president of
General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   ```Clearly a fish out of water' is how he described himself
there,'' recalled Young. ``Everyone else was eating power lunches.
Guy was eating peanut butter sandwiches and dreaming of a
self-sustaining life in upcountry New Engand.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy and Laura, both climbing instructors, met during an
Appalachian Mountain Club event in 1969. Although Waterman was only
5-foot-4, he was _ and remained _ all muscle; his strong, quiet
presence and workman's hands made him seem taller, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Guy and Laura married, and by 1973 had purchased 27
acres in eastern Vermont. The worked hard to live simply. Their
cabin has no electricity, telephone or plumbing. For years, they
have tended a large gardens, maple sugaring, and keeping lists of
just about everything, including the best producing sap trees, the
number of books they had read aloud to each other after dinner (203
as of 1995), and the number of pints of Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice cream
consumed in a year (156 in 1999). Waterman could recite from memory
nine of the 12 books of ``Paradise Lost.'' (Guy and Laura will
never finish reading to each other their latest book, Patrick
O'Brian's ``The Hundred Days.'')
</P>
<P>
   Waterman also kept up with music on a grand piano friends had
carried piece by piece from the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredible place to visit,'' said his sister Anne
Cooley of Bethesda, Md. ``I would be walking the mile toward the
house in the moonlight, sleeping bag in hand, and know I was
getting close when I could hear Jelly Roll Morton piano tunes
slicing through the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   If Waterman's first material love was the homestead, a close
second was The White Mountain National Forest, which now draws an
estimated 6.5 million visitors annually.
</P>
<P>
   Friends who often hiked with Waterman spoke of an occasionally
introspective man, ``a gloomy dark side we only sometimes saw,''
said John Dunn, a Vermont physician. ``But to pry would have been
an invasion of his privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 3, 1998, Waterman shocked his wife when he told her he
had thought seriously about suicide during the hike he had just
taken. She realized then that he would follow through.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sunday morning of Feb. 6, the temperatures across
northern New England were below zero, the winds fiercely out of the
northwest, the skies cloudless. For a man who had chosen to die of
exposure with a favorite view from a 5,260-foot peak, the
conditions were perfect.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-week, Laura started making calls to a few close
mountaineering friends, some of whom were just discovering letters
in their mail slots from Waterman explaining his love for them, his
hope that they would accept his actions, and where they would find
his body. A group of five climbers quietly organized themselves,
and got permission from state authorites to conduct a private
retrieval. Around 9:30 a.m. last Friday, they started their quiet,
slow climb up Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in no hurry,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Waterman lay where he said he would be, just below the summit on
the Bridal Path Trail. A favorite, it was a trail he and Laura had
helped maintain for the past 15 years. Johnny Waterman's climbing
boots, brought home from Alaska, are buried there.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Waterman, never one for fancy wear, was found in old gloves,
woolen pants and pullovers, and a simple windbreaker. By design, he
had not intended to survive long, but he had intended to say
goodbye. He lay on his side, looking north, perhaps 3,500 miles
over the horizon toward Mt. McKinley.

KIRK DOUGLAS FILM `DIAMONDS' HAS THE SPARKLE OF CHEAP ZIRCONIA  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's impossible not to admire Kirk Douglas _ both for a career
that includes ``Paths of Glory,'' ``Spartacus'' and a dozen other
classics over a 50-year span, and for the gutsy determination with
which he's refused to let his 1996 stroke push him into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he's fought back like a tiger, making TV appearances,
writing new novels and a new volume of his autobiography. Now, in
``Diamonds,'' he once again stars in a feature film _ sharing
billing with Lauren Bacall, with whom he burned up the screen in
the 1950 film ``Young Man With a Horn.''
</P>
<P>
   But, sad to say, the movie is not very good. Douglas makes a
noble effort, and manages to overcome the handicap of slurred
speech to marginally win us over. But the script is poorly
conceived and written, the direction is clumsy and amateurish, and
the film is surprisingly vulgar in a way that leaves a bad taste in
the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas plays Harry Agensky, an 80-something former welterweight
boxing champion (so scenes from ``Champion'' can be used as
flashbacks) and recent stroke victim who embarks on a personal
quest in the company of his estranged newspaper-columnist son (Dan
Aykroyd) and 18-year-old grandson (Corbin Allred).
</P>
<P>
   It seems that a half-century earlier, Harry hid a packet of
diamonds _ a payoff received from a gangster for throwing an
important fight _ in the wall of a house somewhere in Reno, Nev.
Now he wants to fetch the gems so he can sell them and use the
money to keep himself out of the old folks home.
</P>
<P>
   As the three generations of Agensky men journey from British
Columbia to Reno _ bickering with each other and engaging in one
highly improbably experience after another _ the movie gradually
becomes just what we know it will be from the gushy music of the
title sequence: an exercise in family forgiveness and male bonding.
</P>
<P>
   It's a movie in which almost nothing works. The situations seem
contrived, the humor is forced, the characters and their
relationships ring false, and the performances don't click _
Douglas can't muster that lion-in-winter radiance that his old
buddy, Burt Lancaster, found in ``Atlantic City.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the filmmakers have opted to set a good 40 or so minutes
of their film in a Reno brothel, with heaps of ribald humor as
Grandpa tries to take on four hookers at once, the son shows
himself to be an unlikely sexual dynamo, and the grandson has a
series of premature ejaculations with the star attraction (Jenny
McCarthy).
</P>
<P>
   It's an undignified spectacle that's a slap at Douglas' legacy
of quality filmmaking. Think of what it would have been like if the
last act of ``On Golden Pond'' had taken place in a swinger's club,
with Fonda and Hepburn playing it for cheap laughs. It's something
you just don't want to see.
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds. Directed by John Asher. Screenplay by Allan Aaron
Katz. Cast: Kirk Douglas, Dan Aykroyd, Lauren Bacall, Corbin
Allred, Jenny McCarthy. Miramax. 90 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sex
scenes.

TO GLEE AND CHAGRIN, BRITAIN'S MILLENNIUM DOME FALLS FLAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, England _ It is hard to pinpoint when the Millennium
Dome, the Labor government's $1.3 billion celebration of national
pride, clearly became a colossal national joke.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was when Prince Charles reportedly ridiculed it as a
``monstrous blancmange,'' in a reference to the unattractive milky
gelatin dessert. Or perhaps it was when thousands of people were
forced to wait for up to three hours in a cramped, unheated subway
station for its opening on New Year's Eve _ a group that,
unluckily, included a large proportion of Britain's national
newspaper editors, who retaliated by making sure the nation shared
the full horror of their inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   By the time The Guardian got around to printing an article
titled ``101 Uses for a Dead Dome'' (No. 12: ``Convert it into a
home for very large Teletubbies''), even the government had to
admit that things were going slightly off message.
</P>
<P>
   And 10 days ago, the company that manages the dome admitted it,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about sluggish ticket sales and a media image about as
positive as that of a suburban nuclear power station, it fired the
dome's chief executive and hired as a replacement Pierre-Yves
Gerbeau, a young, energetic former executive from Disneyland Paris,
giving him a simple order: Fix it, now.
</P>
<P>
   At a lunch at the dome Thursday in which he presented himself to
the wolfish British news pack for the first time, Gerbeau, who is
34, speaks English with a French-American accent, and likes to be
called ``P.Y.,'' with the letters pronounced the English way,
outlined his vision for the dome.
</P>
<P>
   Dominating the east London landscape, the dome is an awesome
Richard Rogers-designed structure that looks like an upside-down
wok and has enormous spines that protrude like ships' masts.
Inside, there are 15 zones devoted to themes like work, play, and
the body; a music-and-dance extravaganza that runs throughout the
day in a center arena; restaurants and cafes; and roving bands of
musicians and performers.
</P>
<P>
   To meet its budget in the next year, the dome has to attract 10
million visitors and make a total of $320 million in revenues from
tickets, merchandise and the like. So far, it is way off schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to make sure things are happening,'' Gerbeau said.
``We sat down and said: `Let's not do philosophy here. Let's do
action.'''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dome's problems, he said, are relatively minor and
easily fixable. Some of the merchandise is prohibitively expensive,
for instance, and the signs are so high that it is hard to see
where you are going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's my problem,'' he said. ``Being small it's, like, I
don't see the signage.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, he said, he is considering introducing
longer hours and more flexible ticket prices; more aggressively
marketing the dome overseas; serving better food; and making sure
that visitors are encouraged to explore the whole thing, not just
one or two exhibits, so that some areas do not become oppressively
crowded while others remain empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am tremendously impressed by the structure and the soul and
the content of this place,'' Gerbeau said. ``This is a team effort,
and we're going to make this happen, no matter that the little ugly
French guy is here,'' referring to himself.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters were surprisingly benign to Gerbeau, even if some
of their questions belied their biases. One repeatedly tried to
make Gerbeau admit that he planned to fill the dome with ``adults
dressed in costume, walking around,'' presumably so that he could
then write that Gerbeau was secretly creating a
Disneyland-on-the-Thames. And when Gerbeau said he was considering
hiring some new managers, another reporter asked, ``French
people?''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the reporters have roughed up Gerbeau in their
newspapers in the last week or so. They have ridiculed him because
he is French and because his duties at Disneyland Paris, originally
known as Euro Disneyland, included overseeing customer parking.
They have reported, incorrectly, that he wrote the thesis for his
master's degree on Club Med. They have repeatedly called him
``Mickey the Gerbil.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerbeau was determined not to let any of that bother him,
gesturing down to the floor of the dome, noting the thousands of
people swarming around the exhibits, and repeatedly saying, ``This
place is fun.'' And the people on the floor seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they said, they do not hate the French, even when the
French are hired to manage faltering British institutions. They do
not hate having to spend $35 a ticket to take a long subway ride
out to the dome. They do not hate having to wait half an hour to
get into the Body Zone, where, as part of the exhibit, there are
lice in the pubic region.
</P>
<P>
   What they hate, they said, are the news media, which seem
largely responsible for the dome's dismal beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typical British cynicism,'' said Anthony Bains, 29,
referring to the bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Bains' companion, Ross Spicer, also 29, observed that ``as a
nation, we always knock everything we do,'' and said he had
particularly liked the body zone, in which visitors walk through a
giant human body and learn how it works. He didn't mention the
lice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart was very realistic,'' Spicer said. ``It hangs above
you and pulsates.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Newband, who has worked in the dome since its opening,
selling soup at a kiosk called Soup, could barely contain himself
on the subject of the British newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrible that our national press is so
negative,'' he said. ``I'm sure half the people who wrote those
things didn't even come here.''
</P>
<P>
   He handed out some tomato soup. ``As far as we're concerned,
things are really picking up. This is going to be a success.''

THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT SPINAL TAP
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Monday, Feb. 21. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just in time for the Grammy Awards _ where such utterly
manufactured entities as the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears
have legitimate chances of actually being feted for ``excellence''
_ comes ``2gether,'' MTV's first TV movie, a documentary-style
parody of the boy-band craze that has emptied the wallets of
parents of pre- and early-teen girls everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the quest of a longtime show-biz grime-bucket
manager (Alan Blumenfeld) to assemble a five-singer ensemble in one
brief week's time, ``2gether'' gets the formula for these acts down
cold. There's the heartthrob lead _ in this case, Jerry O'Keefe,
played by Evan Farmer _ and the ``rebel'' _ an attitudinal but
ultimately wimpy Mickey Park, who frets over what his mom might
think, played by Alex Solowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the ``shy'' one _ Chad Linus (Noah Bastian), discovered
experiencing stage fright at a Mr. New York pageant, and the
reassuring big brother, Chad's middle-age sibling Doug (Kevin
Farley, a dead-ringer for his late brother Chris), who isn't
recruited for his looks but because he can help with all the heavy
lifting. And don't forget the diminutive ``cute'' one, whom the
manager moonily eulogizes as ``my Ewok'' _ Jason ``QT'' McKnight
(Michael Cuccione), who is discovered singing ``The Battle Hymn of
the Republic'' at a karaoke bar and has a terminal illness that
ensures the band reams of publicity.
</P>
<P>
   After the guys are wrangled, the rest of the movie is given over
to shaping them into a semi-competent stage act, with all of a
whopping two songs to perform _ which is OK, since that seems to be
their audience's attention span. One number's lyrics: ``Say it,
don't spray it/I want the news/Not the weather.'' Of course, the
usual complications set in, and of course, by the film's close,
they're all resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``2gether'' has a lot of cute touches _ each pop-up graphic
introducing individual characters comes with its own Universal
Price Code symbol, a wry acknowledgement that everything on display
here is simply ``product.'' At one point, the guys blanch (rightly)
at having to wear patriotic, star-spangled jumpsuits. Overall,
though, the satire is so attenuated that fans of the genre won't
likely even realize they're being played for dupes _ in fact, the
video culled from the film has already been highly requested on MTV
_ and the wane comedy is outpaced by the pallid narrative logic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film speeds along with an agreeable energy; the
editing and general look of the film looks more like a music video
than a documentary. Though ``This Is Spinal Tap'' homages have
abounded in the wake of that classic film, here you wonder if the
filmmakers have even seen the movie they're ripping off.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers, of course, are encouraged to hope that these genial
hacks exploiting the dimwitted masses will make it to the top of
the show-biz heap. It's a little like hoping that Tom Ripley or
Hannibal Lechter get away with their murders, except here,
obviously, we're not encouraged to consider the moral quandary.
Unless Tom or Hannibal the Cannibal were to turn their attentions
to boys' bands, in which two wrongs really would make a right. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``2gether.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Witherspoon, 'Three Kings' didn't deserve Academy shutout
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There was much blather and bluster about 1999
being an unconventional year for film, pocked as it was with
crunchy perversities like ``Being John Malkovich,'' ``Magnolia,''
``The Blair Witch Project,'' ``Go'' and ``Three Kings.'' But you
wouldn't know it looking at Tuesday's Oscar nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The best picture derby, despite inclusion of the slightly
off-center ``American Beauty'' and the spooky but deeply
conventional ``The Sixth Sense,'' wears the mantle of moldy
traditionalism, constituting a company of inoffensive titles that
exert the qualities the Academy falls for every time. True, the
Dreamworks-produced ``Beauty'' scratched itches we forgot we had
(and made them bleed), but the Academy is known on occasion to
salute films that have the power to ruffle (see the X-rated
``Midnight Cowboy''), as long as they don't ruffle too much (see
``Blue Velvet'').
</P>
<P>
   Academy voters, a musty, easily befuddled bunch, like sweep and
broad strokes, snack-size narratives that don't squiggle and that
possess a literary tang, wanton sentimentality and soul-swelling
do-goodism. This year's roster, rounded out by the tough-minded
``The Insider'' and major eye-rollers ``The Cider House Rules'' and
``The Green Mile,'' fulfills all of the requisites.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the genuinely unusual movies of '99 had to settle for
consolation nods _ meaning perfunctory nominations they likely
won't win _ which, frankly, were all some of them deserved.
</P>
<P>
   I for one am relieved the overestimated ``Malkovich'' didn't
yield a best picture nomination. Yet I am appalled that the twinkly
racist fantasy ``The Green Mile'' did. And I don't think anybody
knows what to say about the surprise bounty of nods for the
little-seen ``Cider House Rules.'' The movie's like a boomerang
Hollywood forgot it threw last year that has shwinged back to bonk
it on the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair Witch,'' of course, got nothing (there is no best
scriptless, director-less, improvised, sea sick-inducing picture
category), nor did the snappy teen caper ``Go.'' I stand unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor's fanged high school satire
``Election'' duly earned a best adapted screenplay nod, but where
oh where was Reese Witherspoon, whose Machiavellian goldilocks ran
for student body president with Nixonian fervor? That best actress
slot was wasted on Meryl Streep's mindless nomination for ``Music
of the Heart,'' Wes Craven's latest nightmare about violins and
kids or something. Streep's name, I suspect, is preprinted on
nomination ballots _ a concept, come to think of it, Witherspoon's
perfidious pol might relish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' _ what happened? David O. Russell's seething
action dramedy was flagrantly, baldly, disgracefully overlooked.
How to ignore Russell's screenplay, which mingled the avant and the
pat to strike a happy, galvanizing medium? It was mildly
challenging, and that tends to make the Academy's collective head
go ouchy.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-for-shot, idea-for-idea, Russell out-directed Spike Jonze,
whose ``Malkovich'' only merited its script and supporting actress
nominations, not the one for Jonze. Same goes for Paul
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Anderson's hyperventilating opus ``Magnolia,'' which,
sanely, was only tapped for its grandiose screenplay, Aimee Mann's
song and Tom Cruise's sweaty display of thespian purging.
</P>
<P>
   Several Oscar omissions make me a happy critic: Matt Damon and
Gwyneth Paltrow, vanilla and ice, passed over for the arid
``Talented Mr. Ripley,'' which itself was dissed for best picture
(yes!); Tom Hanks overlooked for his rote cardboard turn in ``The
Green Mile''; Jim Carrey and everyone involved in the lackluster
``Man on the Moon'' snubbed big time.
</P>
<P>
   Several omissions rankle. The swiftly dismissed ``Snow Falling
on Cedars,'' which I quite liked, had to settle on a cinematography
nod because it was pretty. But much of its beauty was shaped by
some of the most exquisite editing in recent film. The Academy
missed this. (And I know voters can do right in this category. When
I saw 1994's ``Speed'' the first thing out of my brain was, ``This
better be nominated for an editing Oscar.'' It was.)
</P>
<P>
   At least Richard Farnsworth earned David Lynch's sorely
underrated ``The Straight Story'' an acting nomination, though the
film, a spare document of gossamer beauty, also deserved
recognition in the best picture, director and cinematography
categories.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not about to wade into the morass of how foreign-language
films are nominated _ it's tricky _ but that doesn't mean I don't
wonder why art-house hit ``Run Lola Run,'' unalloyed adrenaline
from Germany, didn't register on Oscar's fickle radar. There's no
shock or umbrage (just a yawn) in the nomination of Pedro
Almodovar's praise-showered melodrama ``All About My Mother'' from
Spain. Yet I must ask, what is ``Solomon and Gaenor''? It hails
from the United Kingdom, where I thought English was spoken. (The
movie is mostly in English, with parts in Welsh and Yiddish.)
</P>
<P>
   The documentary department continued its checkered tradition of
suspiciously lame nominees. (Recall that three of the best docs of
recent years _ ``Brother's Keeper,'' ``The Thin Blue Line'' and
``Hoop Dreams'' _ were shut out in favor of soft, inspirational
portraits like ``Maya Lin: A Strong, Clear Vision.'')
</P>
<P>
   This year boasts three music-related nonfiction films _ two too
many: critical darlings ``Genghis Blues'' and ``Buena Vista Social
Club,'' and ``Speaking in Strings,'' which was so tepidly reviewed
that it never made it as far as Austin. Also tapped were ``On the
Ropes,'' an earnest but flawed look at an inner-city boxing club,
and ``One Day in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, we know ``American Movie'' _ Chris Smith's hilarious
chronicle of a young filmmaker's almost existential struggle to get
his no-budget horror movie made _ wasn't exactly politically
correct or welling with explicit social redemption. But it was good
_ a witty, colorful portrait of a real live American, swaggering
nerd Mark Borchardt, whose crazy triumph of the will elicited more
inspirational pathos and naked humanity than perhaps any film last
year.
</P>
<P>
   A beer-swigging, job-hopping, debt-ridden romantic with a tragic
mullet haircut, Borchardt emerged as a Midwestern Sisyphus, sad,
comic and deluded. In one scene in the film, our anti-hero watches
the Academy Awards ceremony on TV. You can see in his besotted,
bespectacled eyes how much he wishes he was there, basking in a
little glory.
</P>
<P>
   If only.

JAGUARES SHOW OTHER SIDE OF LATIN EXPLOSION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until SATURDAY, Feb. 19. Fact box below) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfonso Andre of the hugely popular Grammy-nominated rock en
espanol band Jaguares muses about growing up in Mexico City during
the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a lot to do if you were a musician, Andre recalled
with a sigh, adding that ``it was impossible to see bands. Nobody
played there.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed for Andre and his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mexico City is as much a tour stop as Anaheim for the
world's largest bands. And Jaguares, with worldwide record sales of
more than 5 million, is one of the most successful groups in Latin
rock history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being a kid and hearing that Deep Purple were going
to come from England to Mexico to play,'' Andre said. ``But then it
turned out none of the original members were involved. It was just
some guys doing covers. Now, it's changed. But we grew up with
nothing but the radio and records. I mean, even Santana moved away
and never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaguares has something else in common with Santana besides their
hometown: Both are up for Grammy awards at Wednesday's ceremony at
the Staples Center. Jaguares got a nod for best Latin
rock/alternative performance for the moody double album ``Bajo el
Azul de Tu Misterio'' (``Beneath the Blue of Your Mystery''), which
hit the Top 20 on Billboard's Latin albums chart and was a top
seller at Ritmo Latino, the largest Latin music retailer in the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of great new music happening now in Mexico,''
Andre said. ``There's a spark of freshness.''
</P>
<P>
   The bond between charismatic Jaguares leader Saul Hernandez and
his fans is remarkable even north of the border. The band's
arena-level U.S. debut Saturday at the 16,000-capacity Pond in
Anaheim, Calif., is close to selling out. A date last fall at the
Universal Amphitheatre in Universal City, Calif., was sold out in
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguares' popularity in the U.S. is even more unusual when you
consider the quintet receives little, if any airplay, even on Latin
radio. But well before the current Latin pop explosion, Hernandez's
music started reaching Anglo audiences on a large scale when his
previous band, the now-defunct Caifanes, toured with Live before
joining Peter Gabriel's world-music caravan tour WOMAD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest fans still come from the Latin community,'' Andre
admits. ``But we're seeing more and more English-speaking people at
our shows. We're getting a lot of attention from the media, which
draws people in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is often called rock en espanol's most interesting _
and artsy _ figure and has frequently been compared to Jim
Morrison. Utilizing swirling guitars, spacey melodies and poetic
lyrics that touch on ancient mythology, Jaguares' songs reflect
Mexico's proud history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an ancestral culture that exists in Mexico from many
years ago,'' Hernandez, 36, has said. ``When the Spaniards came,
they weren't able, fortunately, to eliminate a certain visceral
sense of (our culture's) mysticism and magic. Mysticism has evolved
as a sense of protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaguares, named for the symbolic jaguar of Mexico's
pre-Columbian past, released its debut album, the Don Was-produced
``El Equilibrio de los Jaguares'' (``The Equilibrium of the
Jaguars''), in 1996, a year after Caifanes disbanded. Last year,
doctors ordered Hernandez to take a break from performing after
tumors on his vocal chords made singing too painful. The
Grammy-nominated current album features a 10-song disc of new
studio material, plus 11 live tracks, including seven Caifanes
songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to do a live album for a long time, but never got
it right until now,'' Andre said. ``We've had so many changes in
the band. But now that our lineup is set, we went on tour and were
delighted with the way the band sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, Andre bears no grudges toward the likes of
Ricky Martin or Jennifer Lopez, singers whose pop confections often
get branded with the Latin pop label to the detriment of more
serious acts from south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try and get away from the business part and concentrate on
the music,'' the drummer said. ``The Latin pop thing didn't really
hurt us, because they sing in English, and we sing in Spanish, and
their version of Latin music really isn't very Latin. It's just pop
mixed with a little bit of a Latin feel. They're mainly like
American pop singers. We don't have a lot in common with them.'' &QL;

<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ In their spirited primary battle, George W.
Bush uses the sobriquet ``the Chairman'' to tar John McCain as a
Washington insider.
</P>
<P>
   But a close examination of McCain's record as chairman of the
powerful Senate Commerce Committee shows that he defies easy
labeling.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator has angered and perplexed many of the
Washington agencies and special interests that he oversees as
chairman. His leadership of the Commerce Committee and his style as
chairman are also interesting indicators of how he might lead if he
ever makes it to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, for example, McCain denounced a measure adopted
by Congress that made it easier for the satellite television
industry to compete head to head with cable television and
broadcasters, calling the legislation a sop to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   What made the senator's remarks so striking was that he had
sponsored an earlier version with great fanfare and had long
promoted efforts to help satellite television, in part because vast
stretches of his home state, Arizona, rely on satellite signals as
the only way to get television reception.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the legislation had been completed, McCain had
been unwilling to strike compromises with broadcasters who were
competing with the satellite companies, and the measure spun out of
his control and wound up being shaped by other senators on the
Commerce and Judiciary Committees.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's failure to get support for his bill and his frustration
with the final legislation signed by President Clinton was hardly
an unusual experience for him as a lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   In his three years as chairman, he has helped pass a number of
laws, most notably one limiting the liability of companies for
computer problems linked to the year 2000 changeover, another that
puts a three-year-moratorium on Internet sales tax, and others on
automobile and truck safety.
</P>
<P>
   But having alienated the Senate leadership and many of his
Republican colleagues because of the highly visible positions he
has staked out in criticizing his colleagues over campaign finance
and pork-barrel legislation, McCain has been unable to garner
enough support for many other measures. And even though he is a
member of their club, a majority of his fellow Republicans in the
Senate have forsaken his presidential candidacy and endorsed his
chief rival, Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that I did not win Miss Congeniality,''
McCain said here earlier this week in a debate in South Carolina.
``I've taken on the iron triangle: special interests, campaign
finance and lobbying. I did not make a lot of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Likening himself to a cross between Presidents Theodore
Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, McCain has tried to convey both
populist and traditional conservative Republican themes, at times
yielding positions that his critics say are not always consistent.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he has sponsored legislation to block the
government from regulating the Internet, saying politicians and
bureaucrats from Washington have no business trying to place their
stamp on the free-flowing medium. But he has also introduced bills
requiring the use of filters to protect children from Internet
pornography and imposing limits on companies from using private
information they get about consumers.
</P>
<P>
   He has consistently criticized large corporate mergers in the
telecommunications industry as a bad byproduct of the 1996 law
deregulating the industry, which he was the only Republican to
oppose. But he has also proposed legislation that would make it
significantly easier for the largest companies to merge by raising
the current concentration caps that limit acquisitions. And he has
repeatedly tried to strip the Federal Communications Commission of
authority to review and impose conditions on mergers of telephone
companies or broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation on his campaign bus, McCain acknowledged that
he walked a fine line between criticizing industry practices while
at the same time advancing broad deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do sometimes feel conflicted,'' he said. ``As a conservative
Republican, I have more faith in the marketplace then the
bureaucrats, and the measures I have put forward are basically
deregulatory in nature. But I have studied the speeches of Teddy
Roosevelt and I understand the importance of these issues for the
common man, who can get shafted by these big companies.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said, for instance, that he did not know what to make of
the government's antitrust case against Microsoft, or what he would
do about the case if he were president.
</P>
<P>
   ``His is a dual personality,'' said Ralph Nader, the consumer
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Nader has sought campaign finance legislation and was
praiseworthy of the work McCain has done on auto and truck safety
and reducing corporate welfare. But Nader has opposed the senator's
efforts to change the tort-law system and limit liability for
computer problems related to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows what people want to hear and he tells it to them,''
Nader said of the senator, ``but he also knows what corporations
pay to get, and he gives that to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has ruffled many of his Senate colleagues, McCain
enjoys a considerable base of power at Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee. The committee, among the most important
in Congress for Corporate America, regulates almost everything that
is bought or sold, or moves over the nation's roads, rails, rivers
or airways.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Republicans in the Senate, McCain enjoys an unusually
good relationship with a small group of consumer advocates who
historically are much closer to liberals and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One member is Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen and
administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
under President Jimmy Carter. Claybrook worked closely with McCain
and his staff on air bag and truck safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Another member is Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington
office of Consumers Union, who is also highly critical of federal
regulators. Kimmelman said McCain was always willing to listen to
Consumer Union's positions and, at congressional hearings, was one
of the few who gave the group an equal platform with many senior
corporate executives and lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he has ignored repeated pleas by corporate
executives not to include the voice of Consumers Union, or to
include it later in the day after the executives have testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``These executives don't realize that the consumer groups
represent the little guy and need to be heard,'' the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman said that while McCain often identified industry
problems in telecommunications and other areas, he had little faith
in regulators to solve them. Still, it is one of the unusual
aspects of McCain's chairmanship that he often seeks advice from
regulators on all kinds of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very effective on the issues he raises,'' Claybrook
said. ``He gets people's attention. In large measure he doesn't
always win because he takes on some pretty knotty issues. He
doesn't always win, but he plants the seeds. And he doesn't mind
combat. He doesn't mind the adversary process. He is comfortable
with it and won't walk away, and that's critical.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's detractors say it shows that he has been unable to cut
the pragmatic political compromises.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Windhausen Jr., president of the Association for Local
Telecommunications Services, an organization that represents the
newer telephone services trying to challenge the older ones, said
that despite McCain's pronounced views the senator had often acted
more in the interests of larger, more established companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say he's being intellectually honest or you can say
he's pushing an agenda that will never be accomplished,'' said
Windhausen, who previously worked as a top aide for Sen. Ernest F.
Hollings of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Commerce
Committee. ``He's using consumer complaints about the
Telecommunications Act to take positions that would be even worse
for consumers and better for big business.''
</P>
<P>
   A lobbyist for the regional Bell companies whose agenda of
getting into long-distance and high-speed Internet service has so
far been unsuccessfully championed by McCain also questioned the
senator's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would call him tenacious, almost ideological,'' said the
lobbyist, who spoke only on the condition that he not be identified
because of issues still before the committee. ``But I would not
call him an effective legislator. After doing work on tobacco and
campaign finance, it makes it hard for him to work together with
others in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, McCain co-sponsored a ``bill of rights''
measure for airline passengers who have consistently complained
about deteriorating service. But in the face of pressure from the
airline industry he changed course, abandoned the legislation and
instead asked the Department of Transportation to monitor several
less severe voluntary measures that other supporters of the
proposed legislation said the industry was already doing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has repeatedly taken hard-line conservative views on
other issues, trying to kill or substantially reduce government
financing of public television and opposing gun-control legislation
and bills that seek to end discrimination against gays.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, part of McCain's difficulty in collaborating with
other Republicans in the Senate stems from his attacks on their pet
projects, often exposing what he calls wasteful spending.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and a number of Republicans who
have been criticized by McCain said he had also advanced his own
wasteful projects in Arizona, including a $56 million authorization
for an environmental and habitat restoration project along the Salt
River, $4.2 million to create a national mediation center in
Tucson, and $3 million for the Turquoise Trail, a joint effort of
the Navajo and Hopi tribes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his aides said those projects were not pork barrel
because hearings were held over their merits, in contrast to
spending programs that are inconspicuously tucked into legislation
without ever being exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' McCain said, ``I cut $90 million out of a planned
courthouse in Arizona. There were plenty of people back home who
weren't too happy about that.''

ELECTION-YEAR CONGRESS TORN BY CONFLICTING IMPULSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Calif., Mo., S.D., Ill.)  (mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A month into this campaign-compressed legislative
year, it is still hard to tell which Republican-controlled Congress
will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be the cautiously bipartisan one that is working with
the White House to pass a China trade bill, repeal earnings limits
for Social Security recipients and increase military spending? Or
will it be the deadlocked one that is riven over the choice of a
new House chaplain and is fighting with President Clinton over
taxes, debt relief and new spending programs?
</P>
<P>
   These same doubts were raised last month before Congress
returned to work. Now there are more certain signs that both sides
may have to settle mostly for issues to campaign on, rather than
produce bills Clinton can sign into law.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting impulses between comity and gridlock reflect the
intensity of this election year. Not only is control of the White
House and Congress at stake, but so is Clinton's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in tight re-election races, like Sen. William V. Roth
Jr., R-Del., are holding out olive branches while being careful not
to sacrifice their core principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question common ground exists between us,'' Roth
said of Clinton's proposed budget. ``But debt reduction is too
slim. Real tax cuts are too few.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, in particular, are eager for accomplishments
to run on this fall to protect their narrow six-seat margin. Top
aides to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert recently drew up a list of 10
``items of agreement'' between Republicans and Clinton, including
eliminating the public debt and bringing China into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats see no advantage in meeting Republicans
halfway on traditional Democratic issues like health care and
education. Campaigning on their party differences, rather than on
their compromises, Democrats say, will propel them into the
majority again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd caution Democrats not to compromise on issues that will
only produce incremental changes that will help Republicans,'' said
Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   At least in principle, Democrats and Republicans sound closer
than they did six weeks ago on many issues, including tighter
regulation of managed care, eliminating the tax code provision that
forces many married couples to pay more than if they were single,
adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and increasing the
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   But discourse has dissolved into discord when the two sides talk
specifics. Republicans want to limit patients' ability to sue their
health providers. Democrats do not. Republicans want to couple
large tax breaks for employers to a $1 hike in the minimum wage.
Democrats do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going nowhere fast,'' Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri,
the Democratic leader, said in an interview. ``The Republicans are
trying to create an illusion they're for something but they
aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and some Democrats disagree, saying there is room
for compromise on health care issues, though not on, say, tighter
gun control laws, which stand little chance of passing this year.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Republicans want to head home early this
year, both to campaign and to avoid being trapped in a yearend
budget negotiation with Clinton that many Republicans fear they
would lose.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert scrapped last year's push for a $792 billion, 10-year
tax cut in favor of piecemeal, specific measures, like a
Republican-sponsored bill that would cut taxes for married couples
by $182 billion over the next decade. The House passed the bill
last week, 268-158, with 48 Democrats voting for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The administration supports a smaller version of the tax cut _
Clinton proposed $45 billion over 10 years that would be restricted
to couples penalized by the current tax code _ but only after the
nation's fiscal house is put in order. Sen. Thomas Daschle of South
Dakota, the Democratic leader, says there is ``a real good
possibility'' lawmakers will approve a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   While both parties agree that the projected budget surpluses, if
they materialize, offer the country a rare opportunity to pay down
the public debt and shore up Social Security and Medicare,
Democrats and Republicans differ over how to divide the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The start of any session is typically marked by such fits and
starts, and this year is no different. Each of the four major bills
approved by the House or Senate faces hurdles in the opposite
chamber or White House opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the marriage tax bill, the House approved legislation to
strengthen ties between the U.S. military and Taiwan. But even
Senate Republicans warn that could unnecessarily provoke China.
</P>
<P>
   Senators approved a bill to make it harder for people to declare
bankruptcy, but tacked on the contentious minimum-wage package. The
Senate also approved a bill to store tons of radioactive waste in
Nevada, but failed to muster enough votes to override Clinton's
promised veto.
</P>
<P>
   When lawmakers return from back-to-back recesses in two weeks,
the budget process will dominate lawmakers' attention. But perhaps
the hottest issue with voters is prescription drug coverage for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has assured his rank-and-file that they will vote on a
prescription drug plan and has ordered key lawmakers to draft one
within 60 days. House Democratic leaders this week said they would
use a parliamentary tactic to try to force a vote on drug coverage
for all Medicare recipients. But some centrist Democrats are
rebelling, arguing that the strategy could hamper efforts to reach
a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the oddest spectacle is the clash between House
Republicans and Democrats over the selection of a Presbyterian
minister instead of a Catholic priest to be the next House
chaplain. ``It's a disgrace,'' said Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., ``that
we have to argue about something as simple as appointing a
chaplain.''

FORMER POW McCAIN UNAPOLOGETIC FOR CALLING CAPTORS `GOOKS' 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ John McCain, whose experience as a prisoner
of war has helped boost his presidential race, was unapologetic
Thursday for using the word ``gook'' to describe his North
Vietnamese captors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated the gooks. I will hate them as long as I live,'' the
Arizona senator told reporters on his campaign bus, two days before
South Carolina's crucial Republican primary, where McCain is
fighting to boost his insurgent campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a Navy flier who endured torture for nearly six years in
a North Vietnamese POW camp, was questioned about a recent report
in The Nation magazine that he had used the term ``gook'' in a
conversation on his bus in October.
</P>
<P>
   The article, the topic of e-mail messages now reportedly
circulating in California, questioned why the media hadn't
challenged McCain on the ethnic slur.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who engages in an almost nonstop, on-the-record
dialogue with reporters while traveling between campaign stops,
didn't deny using the word. But he said he didn't intend it as an
insult of all Vietnamese or Asians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will call right now my interrogator that tortured me and my
friends a gook,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was referring to my prison guards, and I will continue to
refer to them in probably language that might offend some people
here because of their beating and torture of some of my friends.
</P>
<P>
   He said some of the guards were ``cruel and sadistic people''
and had been called much worse.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, McCain rarely speaks about his captors, much less
by using ethnically disparaging terms. But last Saturday, in a
rally at Fort Mill, S.C., McCain turned one of his regular campaign
stories into a questionable reference to Asians.
</P>
<P>
   The comment came as McCain was discussing the fund-raising
abuses of the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996. He often refers to
Vice President Al Gore's visit to the Hsi Lai Temple in suburban
Los Angeles in April 1996, which turned into a fund-raising event.
McCain, massaging the facts, says Gore claims not to know where he
was, and usually remarks that the incense and people in
saffron-colored robes should have given him a clue.
</P>
<P>
   But in Fort Mill, McCain, apparently mixing up his words, said
``all those funny looking people in robes'' should have reminded
Gore where he was. At subsequent stops, McCain reverted to his
former version of the story.
</P>
<P>
   As the pivotal South Carolina primary campaign entered its final
48 hours, both candidates expressed confidence.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush acknowledged Thursday that South Carolina has a
history of voting for the eventual GOP presidential nominee since
1980, but Bush said he feels confident that he will be the nominee
even if he loses Saturday's primary to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina has had the ability to pick the Republican
nominee,'' Bush said. ``I'd put it in the important category. I'm
continuing one way or another. You'll find me in Michigan,
Washington, North Dakota.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's primary is Feb. 22, along with Arizona. Washington,
North Dakota and Virginia hold primaries Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   McCain predicted his campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination may be unstoppable if he wins the South Carolina
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can lose here and go on. This campaign is not over `til
March 7,'' McCain told veterans at a rally in Spartanburg,
referring to the day when California, New York and 11 other states
hold primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll tell you what, my friends. If we win here, I don't
see how we can really be stopped.``
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has been reaching out to Democratic and independent
voters, predicted the South Carolina race will be ``very, very
close. I think it's going to come down to voter turnout.``
</P>
<P>
   A number of veterans have been campaigning for McCain in South
Carolina, which has more veterans per capita than any other state.
One is Mike Thornton, a Medal of Honor recipient from the Vietnam
War who grew up in South Carolina but now lives near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in what John McCain is doing for our veterans. (He)
is much more qualified to be president of the United States,''
Thornton said. ``It's not about Republicans and Democrats here.
It's about the American people. That's who I fought for.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush proudly touted a Virginia poll showing him leading McCain
54 percent to 31 percent. But he also has lost the endorsements of
Secretary of State Bill Jones in California and former Gov. Dan
Evans of Washington. Evans said he was upset with the negative tone
of Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the Detroit News reported Thursday that McCain and Bush are
running television commercials in Michigan attacking one another.
</P>
<P>
   Bush complained about efforts in Michigan, as there have been in
South Carolina, to encourage Democrats to vote in the primary to
teach Gov. John Engler, a Bush backer, ``a lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know how that's going to affect the outcome of the
election,'' Bush said. ``Other than that, I think I've got a good
organization in Michigan. I've been up there a lot and laid the
groundwork for a good campaign. A lot of party leaders have united
behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those endorsements, McCain has closed rapidly on Bush in
Michigan after his upset victory over the GOP front-runner in the
New Hampshire primary.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ There are few general managers throughout the
majors who are not at least a little concerned when pitchers and
catchers report for spring training.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The talent pool has been diluted at both positions _
particularly pitching _ and, quite frankly, there's not enough to
go around for 30 big-league teams.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Astros GM Gerry Hunsicker won't be alone today when
he welcomes the 29 pitchers who will compete for 11 spots on the
Astros' 25-man roster over the next six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 29 pitchers, about 10 have virtually no chance of
making the opening-day roster. And barring anything unforeseen, 10
of the 11 spots already are locked up.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima, Shane Reynolds, Octavio Dotel, Chris Holt, Dwight
Gooden, Billy Wagner, Jay Powell, Doug Henry, Jose Cabrera and
Trever Miller seem assured of spots if they stay healthy and _ in a
few cases _ show some semblance of effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The total would rise from 10 to 11 if Scott Elarton, who is
recovering from offseason shoulder surgery, can get up to speed by
opening day. There is some concern he might miss the first month of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the Astros' best-case scenario, the aforementioned 11
pitchers would be on the opening-day roster, eliminating the
thought of having to choose from seemingly lesser alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the starting rotation is concerned, spring training
will be business as usual for Lima and Reynolds, who are the only
locks. Dotel is the next-best thing to a certainty. Holt and Gooden
likely will round out the rotation unless Elarton is able to start
the season on time, in which case Holt or Gooden would go to the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   In the bullpen, Wagner, Powell, Henry, Cabrera and Miller are
set, barring injury. Assuming Holt and Gooden are in the rotation,
veterans Mike Maddux and Kip Gross are the leading candidates to
fill the final relief spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have a little less depth in the starting rotation than
we've had in previous years, but we're not lacking for candidates
in the bullpen,'' Hunsicker said. ``You might argue about the
quality, but we have quantity.
</P>
<P>
   ``By definition, bullpens are suspect because _ outside of the
closer and possibly a setup man _ most of the candidates are
usually guys with checkered careers, guys who couldn't make it as a
starter or a closer and they end up in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most bullpens look like question marks to begin the season.
That's one area where a lot of teams can have upside surprises.
Every year, the bullpen looks suspect on paper, but we always find
a way to put together a quality bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring shouldn't be much different, especially if Elarton
is healthy and the Astros avoid any other serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elarton will be the key,'' Hunsicker said. ``If he's out for a
long time, that might leave us a little vulnerable, but we have a
multitude of candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros would like to give righthanded prospect Wade Miller
at least another half-season at Class AAA New Orleans, but he is
being prepared as an option in the event the Astros need another
starter at the beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is Trever Miller, who was a starter
throughout his minor-league career.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the pitchers and catchers who will report to the
Osceola Sports Complex today, the Astros also extended early
invitations to outfielders Moises Alou and Richard Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   It is unknown whether either player will arrive early or choose
to report Wednesday with the rest of the position players. Alou and
Hidalgo were given early invitations because both are coming off
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In a related matter, Hunsicker addressed a report that Alou
would be willing to waive his no-trade clause to play for the
Braves, Rockies or Cubs by saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``Trading Moises Alou is not an issue. It's not something the
player desires or something the team desires. To comment any
further than that would be inappropriate because it's just not an
issue.''

GREENSPAN HINTS OF MORE INTEREST RATE HIKES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Thursday
signaled the likelihood of more interest rate hikes ahead as the
central bank tries to cool down a supercharged U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   And while Greenspan voiced particular concern about high oil
prices, he urged the administration not to dip into the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve in an effort to force down prices.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing Thursday on Capitol Hill for his semiannual report to
Congress on the state of the economy, Greenspan told members of the
House Banking Committee: ``There is little evidence that the
American economy ... is slowing appreciably.''
</P>
<P>
   While calling the economy's performance ``unprecedented in my
half-century of observing,'' Greenspan argued ``those profoundly
beneficial forces driving the American economy to competitive
excellence are also engendering a set of imbalances that, unless
contained, threaten our continuing prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan warned the Fed ``will have to stay alert for signs
that real interest rates have not yet risen enough to bring the
growth of demand into line with that of potential supply, even
should the acceleration of productivity continue.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he has talked of such dangers in the past, Greenspan
argued that proper alignment ``seems more pressing today than it
did earlier, before the effects of imbalances began to cumulate,
lessening the depth of our various buffers against inflationary
pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed watchers interpreted Greenspan's comments to mean the
central bank will almost surely raise interest rates a quarter of a
percentage point at its next meeting, scheduled for March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Following that possible hike, many economists look for yet
another quarter point rate hike down the road, either at the Fed's
meeting in May or at a subsequent session in June.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments were enough to squelch a 100-point rally on
Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged after
Greenspan's prepared remarks were released, ending the day down
46.84 points to close at 10,514.57.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market responded to the news by boosting the 30-year
Treasury 1/2 point, or $5 per $1,000 in face value. The yield,
which moves in the opposite direction of price, fell to 6.22
percent from 6.26 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does nothing if not contribute to volatility,'' said Bryan
Jordan, economist for Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan argued investors should not have been surprised by
his message.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been giving the same speech for the last couple of
years,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hilber, an economist with Wells Fargo in Minneapolis, agreed
Greenspan's testimony was not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it obviously confirmed to everyone that, yeah, the Fed is
going to be in a raising rates mode, and maybe for some time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed already has nudged up short-term interest rates four
times since last June, raising the Federal Funds rate a full 1
percentage point to the current 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those rate hikes, the U.S. economy grew at a robust 4
percent in 1999, surging at an even faster pace in the second half
of the year, Greenspan said. Most Fed economists expect the
economy's growth rate to moderate somewhat this year, to 3.5
percent to 3.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit like an engine running so hot you have to
dab it with water every once in a while so it doesn't flame out on
its own,'' said David Lapin, president of Houston-based Lapin &AMP;
Wigginton Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   While Greenspan and other Fed officials remain concerned about
the spectre of inflation, the economy is showing few signs of
inflation to date.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale prices remained unchanged in January, the U.S. Labor
Department reported Thursday. And if volatile food and energy
prices are factored out, the core Producer Price Index actually
fell 0.2 percent that month.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, crude oil prices climbed above $30 a barrel
to reach the highest levels seen since the Persian Gulf War,
although it dropped back to $29.46 a barrel Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about what's happening to oil prices,''
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan noted that inventory levels for both crude and
petroleum products are far below normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, some are joking that we need to measure the fumes to
get any measurable inventory at all these days,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Those tight inventories make the market vulnerable to price
spikes when even minor supply disruptions occur. And this is the
time of year when the industry begins gearing up for the busy
summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan opposes a plan to pull oil out of the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve in an effort to manipulate prices downward.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states have been
trying to prod the administration into adopting a plan to allow
energy companies to swap crude from the reserve in exchange for a
promise to replenish the stockpile at a later date when prices are
lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always viewed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a
reserve in the event of a serious crisis,'' Greenspan said. ``I
mean by that a shut-down in Middle East oil, or something of that
nature, because of some catastrophe of some form. I think it would
be a mistake to try to move market prices by small additions or
subtractions from the (reserve).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with an overall world market which is huge,
relative to our Strategic Petroleum Reserve,'' Greenspan said.
``And it's foolishness to believe that we can have any significant
impact short of a very major liquidation short-term of that
reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, a member of the Banking Committee,
challenged the notion oil prices are so out of line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm a little less startled about oil prices today then
I was a year ago when they were around $10 or $12 a barrel,''
Bentsen told Greenspan. ``And $30 a barrel, at least in my neck of
the woods, is close to a fair price.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, Greenspan believes the market, not government, will
best resolve energy price issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through innumerable synthetic fuels discussions,
programs and endeavors to counter previous oil shocks. I think our
experience suggests that we ought to leave it to the marketplace to
make these judgments.''

PRESTIGE AND MONEY RIDING ON OUTCOME OF AMERICA'S CUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HERB McCORMICK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The source of all the hubbub rests in a
shatterproof-glass case in a still room on the second floor of the
Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron. Wide windows offer a picturesque
view of the Auckland Harbor Bridge. Each evening, one of the
security guards entrusted with its care packs it into a specially
made suitcase and tucks it into the club's vault.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the daily grind of the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday (Friday night Eastern Time), the five-of-nine-race
finals to determine the cup's future address will commence between
the current defender, Team New Zealand, and the hopeful usurper,
Italy's Prada Challenge. Much is riding on the outcome of this
waterborne duel.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Italian yacht, Luna Rossa, win, the reasoning goes,
the cup will be swept away to the glorious shores of the
Mediterranean Sea, where a host of new European suitors _ England,
Germany, Norway, Sweden _ would join the ranks of established
challengers like France, Switzerland and Spain to create a
continental maritime extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   In this warm and fuzzy scenario, the United States would renew
its efforts to regain the cup on the largesse of the many flush
corporate sponsors who would clamor onto the bandwagon, their
interests piqued by the chance to woo new markets far from the
tiny, remote antipodes.
</P>
<P>
   For this to happen, of course, New Zealand must relinquish the
cup in its inaugural defense. And for most Kiwis, this is a destiny
far too awful to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of optimism out there,'' said Jonathon Denver,
the assistant manager of Euro, perhaps the trendiest of the many
new Auckland restaurants to open along the wharves bordering the
downtown syndicate camps at Viaduct Harbor. ``Our national identity
is aligned with our sporting figures. If we lose, the whole country
will go into mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the Viaduct was a nasty, fetid example of urban
neglect. Today, it is the showcase of a waterfront renaissance
ignited by New Zealand's winning cup effort in San Diego in 1995.
Tens of millions of dollars have been invested not only on the
yachting facilities _ easily the most impressive ever assembled for
any regatta _ but also on the hundreds of new apartments and dozens
of fledgling cafes and pubs, as well as the walkways and parks that
interconnect them.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, the cup will have left an amazing legacy here. Of
course, to truly reap the benefits of this miraculous
transformation, New Zealand must retain it for at least one
defense. Otherwise, said Denver, contemplating the image of closed
doors on the very establishments that fronted big money to open,
``Six months from now there could be a lot of sad stories around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is sympathetic. Take Mick Cookson, the legendary
Kiwi boat builder who fashioned both of Team New Zealand's new
boats _ NZL 60 and its backup, NZL 45. ``Well, some of those
downtown developers might see things go flat if we fail,'' said
Cookson, who believes all this talk of losing is an interesting
academic exercise, but impossible. ``But if someone risked
everything on keeping the cup, that's their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In the here and now, however, the party is on and the boom-town
mentality rages. This was evident last Monday, when the speakers at
a 500-person dinner following a technology information conference
included the Silicon Graphics and Netscape founder, Jim Clark, and
the renowned venture capitalist Tom Perkins. Both entrepreneurs are
in town aboard their respective superyachts, an international fleet
of which line the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you win this thing again,'' Clark said, to cheers, ``I
might have to come back with my own cup campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark would be welcomed with open arms. Many Kiwi businessmen
were disheartened when challenging syndicates representing the New
York Yacht Club and San Francisco's St. Francis Yacht Club were
eliminated. So, too, went the logic, did their chances of wooing
deep-pocketed members with Down Under proposals.
</P>
<P>
   So it was big news this week when the American investor Jay
Snider, whose family has had interests in a number of professional
sports teams in Philadelphia, ponied up $5 million to back the
Kiwi-based Internet cup broadcaster Virtual Spectator.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not all big deals and bigger boats. At the Loaded Hog,
a waterfront pub with original tank-test models of the winning 1995
New Zealand boats dangling from the ceiling, the beer is cold and
the taps are open. ``Whatever happens, we'll be fine,'' said the
manager, Sara Tucker. ``We get everybody in here _ overseas
tourists, yachties hangers-on, out-of-town Kiwis. They're all
thirsty.''
</P>
<P>
   And Win West, a native Aucklander who drives one of the
ubiquitous water taxis zipping along the harbor, shares a similar
philosophical outlook. ``Auckland's lifeblood is the water, and the
cup has brought this waterfront alive,'' he said. ``Even if we
lose, it will be good for the cup. The Italians have been great
sportsmen, and it would be wonderful for Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   His countrymen may not share his magnanimous view but, for now,
it doesn't matter. For the next two weeks, at least, the America's
Cup is a Kiwi icon, and its harbor view from the yacht squadron's
second floor is just fine.

`WHOLE NINE YARDS' FAILS TO MEASURE UP AS A CAPER COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   After his success as a serious psychologist in ``The Sixth
Sense,'' Bruce Willis has reverted to his smug and smilin' ways.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Whole Nine Yards'' _ which refers to a cool $10 million
_ he plays a recently released-from-prison hit man named Jimmy
``The Tulip'' Tudeski. He's gone into hiding in Montreal because a
Chicago syndicate boss, Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), is out to
silence him permanently. It seems Jimmy ratted out Janni's father
to the feds, sending the old don down the river for the rest of his
natural days and giving Jimmy a short sentence.
</P>
<P>
   So the smooth, unflappable assassin has settled for upward
mobility in a nice neighborhood next door to dentist Nicholas
Oseransky, or ``Oz,'' played by ``Friends'' star Matthew Perry, and
his evil-spirited French wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), who would
love to see her bumbling husband dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Oz's perky assistant Jill (Amanda Peet), Janni's
right-hand man Frankie ``Figs'' Figueroa (Oscar nominee Michael
Clarke Duncan) and Jimmy's beautiful ex-wife Cynthia (Natasha
Henstridge).
</P>
<P>
   All are itching to pull the trigger on someone because there is
$10 million moldering in a bank vault and only three people know
how to retrieve the dough.
</P>
<P>
   Before long everyone has a price on his or her head, and who
will whack whom becomes the question.
</P>
<P>
   There are some clever twists and the film is an initially
promising caper comedy. But the script refuses to let the
cleverness develop and, once each character's alter-identity or
real motive is evident, it becomes a pedestrian movie with a
predictable romance at its heart.
</P>
<P>
   Another big problem is the casting of Willis and Perry. When
he's subdued, Willis can be an effective actor. But here he appears
to be slumming, overwhelming a role that demands subtlety. Perry
has yet to prove himself on the big screen. His last film, ``Three
to Tango,'' was awful, and while he's pretty good at physical
comedy and has a nice sense of timing, he always looks rigid and
uncomfortable. While the mix of Willis' languor and Perry's uptight
demeanor could make good comedy, it's done in by a script that
settles into mediocrity and opts for a hasty exit.
</P>
<P>
   The Whole Nine Yards. Directed by Jonathan Lynn. Written by
Mitchell Kapner. Cast: Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Rosanna
Arquette, Michael Clarke Duncan. Warner Bros. 103 minutes. Rated R
for language, violence.

FDA APPROVES VACCINE AGAINST BACTERIA THAT CAUSES MENINGITIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, N.M., Pa.)  (rk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first vaccine to prevent a leading cause of
meningitis in infants and toddlers was approved Thursday by the
Food and Drug Administration, one day after a panel of scientific
experts recommended against giving it to all children under age 5
in part because of its high cost.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine, Prevnar, manufactured by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories,
protects youngsters against the pneumococcus bacteria, which each
year causes an estimated 1,400 cases of meningitis and 16,000 cases
of blood poisoning in children under 5, as well as 40 percent of
all childhood ear infections.
</P>
<P>
   The approval is important because meningitis, while not very
common, kills several hundred children each year and leaves others
with brain damage and other neurological problems. But prevention
will come at a price; a four-dose course of Prevnar will cost $232,
roughly the same as all other childhood immunizations combined.
</P>
<P>
   With that high cost in mind, a panel of expert advisors to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on Wednesday
that the vaccine become part of the routine immunization schedule
for the roughly 3.8 million babies born each year, but given
immediately on a catch-up basis only to children under age 2.
</P>
<P>
   Among 2-to-5 year olds, the panel called for vaccinating only
those children at high risk, specifically blacks, Native Americans,
Alaskan natives and youngsters with HIV, sickle-cell anemia or
other disorders that weaken the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was unusual for two reasons: it marked the first
time that the panel had given special consideration to black
children, and only the second time it had taken cost into account.
Taking into account lost time at work for parents, the panel
conducted a cost-benefit analysis for Prevnar. It concluded that
the vaccine would be cost-effective at $46 a dose, $12 less than
the $58 the company has set.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Dr. Peter Paradiso, vice president of
scientific affairs and research strategy for Wyeth-Ayerst, defended
the price, and said the company was pleased with the committee's
decision. He said the company spent 14 years developing the vaccine
and tested it in more than 50,000 children, which drove up the
cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal for this vaccine was for it to become part of the
routine immunization schedule for all kids, and it will,'' Paradiso
said, adding that ``the amount of disease you are preventing and
will prevent for years to come justifies the price.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's advice is not binding, but the disease control
centers is likely to follow it, and doctors, health insurance
companies and government funded health programs, will use the
guidelines to determine how to put Prevnar into medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   While some doctors say it troubles them to offer vaccines to
some children and not others, Dr. Gary Overturf, an infectious
disease expert at the University of New Mexico, said a committee of
the American Academy of Pediatrics has reached the same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are uncomfortable making decisions strictly on cost, but I
don't think this was strictly on cost,'' he said. ``We had to set a
priority to put those children at highest risk first.'' He said it
would be logistically impossible to vaccinate all children under
age 5. And in any event, over the next five years, once all
newborns have gotten the vaccine, the issue will become moot.
</P>
<P>
   For Wyeth-Ayerst, a division of American Home Products in
Philadelphia, the FDA approval is good news; its last childhood
vaccine, to prevent rotavirus, was approved in 1998 but withdrawn
from the market last year amid concerns that it could cause a
painful and potentially fatal bowel obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Prevnar is extremely
effective in preventing cases of pneumococcal meningitis, a
dangerous infection of the spinal cord and central nervous system
that often leaves children with neurological damage, including
deafness and learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical trials, the vaccine, which is targeted against seven
of the most common strains of pneumococcus, proved 100 percent
effective in preventing infection with those strains, and 90
percent effective in preventing infection with all strains, the FDA
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first vaccine that can seem to have a great impact
on severe diseases'' caused by pneumococcus, said Dr. Jesse
Goodman, deputy director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research at the food and drug agency. ``For the most serious
infections, it really appears to be excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency said infants can receive the vaccine at 2, 4, 6 and
12-15 months of age. For children under age 2 who have already
missed the initial doses, the vaccination schedule will be
determined by health care providers.

DRIVERS QUESTION RULES AFTER `BORING' TWIN 125S AT DAYTONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ There will be a pass made for the lead of
the 42nd[ annual] Daytona 500 on Sunday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Won't there? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As absurd as that might sound when talking about a NASCAR
Winston Cup race, it was a valid inquiry following the annual Twin
125 qualifying races at the Daytona International Speedway. A
combined 100 laps of caution-free racing around the high-banked,
2.5-mile trioval produced not one pass for the lead yesterday, as
Bill Elliott and Ricky Rudd paced their respective sprints
flag-to-flag.
</P>
<P>
   The outcomes provided a sentimental return to Victory Lane here
for Elliott, a dominating Daytona 500 champion in 1985 and 1987 _
in the days before introduction of the carburetor restrictor plate.
Rudd, meanwhile, made his first visit to Daytona's winner's circle
four days after crashing and landing on his roof during the Bud
Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   But the feel-good stories surrounding the 40-something winners
were overshadowed by a burgeoning quality-of-racing issue that
could be spelled B-O-R-I-N-G.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly not going to tell any of these drivers, who are
running 192 mph with their front ends pushing, that it's boring,''
said NASCAR official Mike Helton, addressing an already touchy
issue at DIS.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,400-pound Fords, Chevrolets and Pontiacs compete here with
restrictor plates that reduce an engine's ability to crank out
horsepower from 750 to 450, creating racing in single-file packs
and a heightened possibility of multi-car wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   That situation has been compounded by NASCAR's recently
standardized shock/spring-rate package. Introduced in January to
make the racing safer and more cost-effective, the new rules were
warmly received by most teams during off-season testing. Yesterday,
however, the race results left many drivers complaining that their
cars will not handle through the track's 31-degree banked turns.
Instead of turning left, the cars are pushing up toward the wall,
forcing drivers to lift off the accelerator and lose time and
ground.
</P>
<P>
   It is a condition known as ``aero push,'' and it prompted Mike
Skinner to lobby NASCAR for a rules change immediately after
driving his new No. 31 Lowe's Chevy Monte Carlo to a second-place
finish to Rudd in Twin No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``They [NASCAR] might consider something with the shocks,'' said
Skinner, who spent his race staring into the rear-end ``TV panel''
of Rudd's No. 28 Texaco/Havoline Ford Taurus. ``Everybody in the
first race complained about push. We tried the best we could, and
we just never could get the car to turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when you see Dale Earnhardt finish out of the top five at
Daytona, you know his car wasn't very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, a seven-time Cup champion and Skinner's teammate at
Richard Childress Racing, saw his 10-year winning streak in Twin
125-mile races end with an 11th-place finish in the opener.
Earnhardt thoroughly trashed the current rules after watching
Elliott, reigning Cup champion Dale Jarrett and Rusty Wallace lead
a Ford sweep in Twin No. 1. But Rudd, Skinner and Ward Burton made
it a Ford/Chevy/Pontiac Grand Prix top three in Twin No. 2, with
rookie Dale Earnhardt Jr. piloting his aerodynamically challenged
Monte Carlo to fourth.
</P>
<P>
   That apparently was enough evidence for NASCAR officials to
dismiss thoughts of any quick aero fixes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to change anything for the Daytona 500,'' said
Helton, NASCAR's senior vice president and chief executive officer.
``One of the things we're concerned about is not creating a moving
target after six days of Daytona 500 practice. And we're not
convinced any change is necessary. We're going to press on.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, the pole-sitter for the season-opener, said teams in
every camp need to massage their cars today and tomorrow _ and
during the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race is about handling now,'' said Jarrett, driver of the
No. 88 Quality Care Service/Ford Credit Taurus. ``You do that by
changing the things they allow you to change _ swaybars, trackbars,
spring rubbers and things like that. They have the same opportunity
that we do.''
</P>
<P>
   And the same opportunity to change the complexion of NASCAR's
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Daytona 500, and I think you'll see an exciting
race,'' Rudd said. ``I hope so. I mean, the fans didn't pay a lot
of money to come and see us run single-file, I think.'' nn

   Taking a New Look At Some Easy Targets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Harold S. Geneen _ the architect behind the ITT Corp.'s
foray into, well, just about everything _ was right, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Conglomerates have long gotten a bad rap because they are
perceived as inefficient dinosaurs. Corporate raiders and analysts
plot how to break them up in order to ``unlock'' value. And
shareholders complain about their low price-to-earnings multiples.
</P>
<P>
   But a December study by Larry Shulman, senior vice president of
the Boston Consulting Group, throws a fair amount of cold water on
those preconceptions. Shulman first looked at the performance of
the Value Line Diversified Companies Index, a proxy for
conglomerates, and compared it with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index for the 10 years through 1997. Surprise! The conglomerate
index was the winner in average annualized return, 18.6 percent to
17.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that from 1989 to 1996, conglomerates that
``de-merged'' _ consultant-speak for being broken up _ were just as
likely to underperform the market as to outperform it.
</P>
<P>
   Shulman's explanation for all this is straightforward: there are
good conglomerates and bad conglomerates. Pick the right ones _
premiums, as he calls them _ and investors will reap the rewards.
</P>
<P>
   While the premium conglomerates vary in the types of businesses
they run, they share four key characteristics, the study said. They
shrink or abandon their low-return businesses and invest in their
high-return ones.
</P>
<P>
   They emphasize performance and accountability in management.
Their portfolios of businesses have what he described as a
``distinctive'' logic to them. And their earnings are consistent
and predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Shulman found that for the 10 years through 1997, his 50 premium
conglomerates returned 27 percent annually, on average, versus 18
percent for the S&AMP;P 500 and a negative 1 percent for the 50
underperformers he identified.
</P>
<P>
   The five top-performing premium conglomerates, ranked by total
returns to shareholders over that period, were Gillette, Safeguard
Scientifics, Pfizer, Berkshire Hathaway and Crompton &AMP; Knowles.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Consulting did not disclose the underperformers. Perhaps
they will make for good future clients. &QL;

   Generally, the Coasts Still Pay the Most &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where you live continues to dictate how much you are paid, with
salaries on the West and East Coasts again outpacing the national
average, according to a new survey by William M. Mercer Inc., a
compensation consulting company based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer's 2000 Geographic Salary Differentials Report, released
this month, found that private employers in San Jose, Calif., in
the heart of Silicon Valley, generally paid the highest salaries.
Second was New York City, followed by San Francisco, Los Angeles
and Stamford, Conn. (Newark was No. 6.)
</P>
<P>
   The lowest pay was in Brownsville, Texas. Others at the bottom
of the list were Albuquerque; Little Rock, Ark.; Birmingham, Ala.;
and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The survey covered more than 200 American cities. It found that
a job with an average salary, nationwide, of $60,000 would pay 17.4
percent more, or $70,440, in San Jose, and 15.4 percent more, or
$69,240, in New York. That same job in Brownsville, however, would
average about 16.1 percent less, or $50,340.
</P>
<P>
   The cities conforming most closely to the average were
Charlotte, N.C., and Richmond, with salaries paying $60,120 and
$59,940, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The survey highlights the challenge faced by large employers
with employees in various parts of the country, said Joyce Cain, a
Mercer consultant in Louisville, Ky., who helped analyze the
report. ``This will help employers set a salary range when
relocating workers, since the cost of labor varies so much by
region,'' she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the survey focused on cities' costs of labor
rather than on general cost-of-living expenses but that one often
reflected the other.
</P>
<P>
   The Silicon Valley, with its high-paying technology jobs, has
led the salary list for the last decade. New York has also ranked
high.

 &HT;    Popularity of book clubs growing
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ There was Guiness and Budweiser, and
soda for those who wanted it. And microwave popcorn, bags of it
poured into wooden bowls, enough Jiffy Pop for a January evening.
</P>
<P>
   There were six men dressed comfortably, seated in a circle in
Earl Reid's family room, and one book _ ``Les Miserables.''
Unabridged. War and love and prison and a revolution of ideas in
1,000-plus pages by Victor Hugo.
</P>
<P>
   And there was discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about Jean Valjean is his strength, just his
physical strength ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``... this guy was like an all-star wrestler type ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``... when he picked the wagon up off the guy ...''
</P>
<P>
   They talked about Valjean's moral dilemmas, asked each other
whether they, in the same situation, would have been as strong.
Reid began reading a favorite passage, his glasses low on his nose,
words about memory and beauty and love.
</P>
<P>
   ```The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are
loved,''' he read. The other men were silent for one breath, then
two and three, looking at their hands or the carpet or the big bowl
of popcorn. Then someone joked he'd seen that on a Hallmark card
and everyone laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said, ``I would just like to commend us for being brilliant
on choosing this book.''
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the Grand Book Club nodded in agreement: It
was a good choice, and some commented that if it hadn't been for
the book club they never would have read ``Les Miserables,''
unabridged or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Book clubs are interesting that way, inspiring people to read
things they normally wouldn't, bringing together diverse
assortments of individuals with an interest in reading and learning
and meeting others who share that interest.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of book clubs is growing. In Mesa County, Colo.,
there are at least 40 book clubs meeting weekly or monthly. There
are about 500,000 book clubs in the United States, said Rachel
Jacobsohn, author of ``The Reading Group Handbook'' and founder of
the Chicago-based Association of Book Group Readers and Leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Book groups have been around for hundreds of years,'' she
said. ``In America, they've had a wellspring of attention for well
over a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at what I've seen happen in just the last year,''
said Janie VanWinkle, manager of the Grand Junction Barnes &AMP; Noble.
``The book clubs that we've become aware of in the store have
doubled in the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, some credit talk-show host Oprah Winfrey with
leading the renaissance in book reading. In 1996 she founded
Oprah's Book Club in which she picks one book and its author to
profile on her show each month. Each of her book picks has shot
into the best-seller stratosphere after being featured. Winfrey is
credited with helping pump millions of dollars into a recently
revitalized publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's raising the social issues of what authors are
putting into their novels and that's her purpose,'' Jacobsohn said.
``Once readers are lead by Oprah to the pool, to the blessings of
reading a book, now they want to talk about the book and that's
another very positive thing that she's done for the people of this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Winfrey can take credit for inspiring people to read,
the fact that the conservative estimate is 500,000 book clubs
nationally means people are reading and getting together to talk
about what they read.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the phenomenon, publishers of many trade books have
begun printing a reader's guide at the end of books, with questions
and topics for discussion that cater to book clubs. Some people,
such as Carol Benet of Belvedere, Calif., have become freelance
book group facilitators, traveling around the country to host
seminars on how to establish book groups and visiting book groups
to teach members how to prompt discussion, resolve conflicts and
choose books that will educate and enlighten.
</P>
<P>
   With the increase in number of book clubs, the purpose of them
has diversified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one way people can get together and still
maintain the community-type atmosphere on a more intimate level,''
said Dana Weber, owner of Readmoor Books.
</P>
<P>
   At the Feb. 7 meeting of The Reviewers, the oldest book club in
Grand Junction, each member of the club donned a vintage hat
provided by Melba Schmidt, who hosted the meeting, as they listened
to Shirley Ela review ``Annals of the Former World'' by John
McPhee. The women tried on different hats before the meeting began,
laughing and admiring the feathers and flowers on each other's
hats, which provided a catalyst for conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The group formed in 1892 as the Isabella Ivy Tourist Club, a
group of Grand Valley women who wanted to broaden their education
as they prepared to travel to the World Exposition. It became The
Reviewers in 1904 and since then has established the Ottman Shelf
at the Mesa County Public Library for donations from group members,
and uses the membership dues to buy flowers for group members who
lose a loved one and wine for the spring party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Book groups are a source of social camaraderie and are a mode
of continuing education,'' Jacobsohn said. ``It's a way for people
to be face-to-face with each other in kind of an intimate setting
where they can exercise their hearts and their minds at the time
time. It provides a safe atmosphere for discussion, it's a way to
learn about others, learn about characters in a book, learn about
how others respond, learn about yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mesa County, there are groups in which one person reviews a
book for the other members _ such as The Reviewers _ and groups in
which everyone reads the book and discusses it. The Grand Book Club
consists of just men, and some groups, such as Seasoned Women and
Monumental Women, are just for women. Some meet in the morning,
others in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Friday Morning Book Group, which meets September through May
and is a branch of the local American Association of University
Women, has one person present the book, which group members read
before the meeting, with extensive background on the author and the
book. Sometimes the presenter has a guest speaker if the book's
topic facilitates it. At the Jan. 21 meeting, Anita Johnson
presented ``Midwives'' by Chris Bohjalian, about a midwife who is
accused of killing a woman on whom she performed an emergency
Caesarean delivery, and asked Janet Grant from Mesa Midwives to
speak to the group about midwifery.
</P>
<P>
   Grant spoke about Colorado regulations for midwives, a midwife's
role in pre-natal care and delivery and answered questions from
group members about a physician's role in midwifery, hard
deliveries and delivery protocols. They shared stories of their own
deliveries and discussed in quiet voices with the women sitting by
them whether they would have wanted a midwife to deliver their
children.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsohn said some book groups have a more social dynamic while
others are more literary and academic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking about a book can be social,'' she said. ``There are a
lot of book groups that say, 'Did you like the book? Who's going to
play the character in the movie?' and then eat and have
conversation. Then there are people who are highly academic, who do
intense literary criticism of the book.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it depends on the reading experience a person wants and
what a person wants from the book group, whether it's to meet
people with similar interests or to hash out the symbols and
metaphors and literary devices of a particular book.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding which book group to join, she said, it sometimes
helps to look at the group's previous reading selections. Sometimes
groups read just classics, or only prize winners, or science
fiction, or nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, the selections vary widely depending on what
sounds interesting and is picked by the group's selection committee
or because one member suggests a certain book that sounds
interesting. At the end of Grand Book Club's Jan. 17 meeting,
member Steve Watson suggested ``Epitaph of a Small Winner'' as
their next book and everyone agreed. In their more than 12 years of
book discussion, club members also have read ``Generation X,''
``Hamlet,'' ``Rendezvous with Rama,'' ``Tropic of Cancer,'' ``Iron
John,'' ``Othello,'' ``Texasville,'' ``The Firm,'' ``Walden'' and
``Death Comes for the Archbishop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just like getting together and talking about what we've
read,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   So on a January evening he had his shoes off and his feet
propped comfortably on a coffee table, a copy of ``Les Miserables''
open on his lap. ``This cat was a genius,'' he said, referring to
Hugo, and the discussion meandered from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took world history in high school,'' Dennis Kirtland
said, ``it was probably one of the dullest things I've ever done
because all we did was memorize dates of battles. This makes it
real.''
</P>
<P>
   ``... I think Hugo loved Napoleon ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``... My problem is I want to skip over some of the stuff like
Waterloo but I'm afraid I'll miss something ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``... When she had to sell her teeth that was so pitiful ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``... Isn't it fun to discover a book like this?''

ELLIOTT ENDS DROUGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ After riding around in circles for the
past five years, Bill Elliott finally found his way back to Victory
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who had not won any race since Sept. 4, 1994, took the
checkered flag in yesterday's first Twin 125 qualifying race at
Daytona International Speedway. He will start third Sunday in the
Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like this is more for the \Rcrew\S guys who worked to
put this car together than for me, because they made it easy for
Bill Elliott to sit in Victory Lane,'' said Elliott, who passed
Dale Jarrett on the first lap and led all 50 laps. ``All the guys
with the long hours and the hard work and the weekends they didn't
have off, it's a reward for those guys to be able to put it all
together and sit in Victory Lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's last victory, which came at Darlington, was the 40th
of his career. On Sunday, he will try to end his streak of 169
points races without a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we can win,'' said Elliott, who has two Daytona
500 victories. ``You've just got to have a little bit of luck on
your side.'' AROUND AND AROUND
</P>
<P>
   The second time around was not as sweet for Joe Nemechek.
Nemechek had the top speed in yesterday's second-round qualifying
for the NAPA Auto Parts 300, turning a 187.141 mph lap around the
2.5-mile trioval.
</P>
<P>
   But Nemechek will start only 26th tomorrow in the Busch Series
race.
</P>
<P>
   His speed of 189.225 mph, which was the fastest in Wednesday's
pole qualifying, was disallowed after the post-qualifying
inspection. Kevin Triplett, NASCAR's director of operations, said
the wheel weight distribution on the No. 87 Chevrolet was outside
the allowed parameters. FINE TIME
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials fined Jason Shapiro $2,000 for his part in the
fight between drivers Tony Stewart and Robby Gordon in the garage
area Wednesday. Shapiro, a crew member on Stewart's No. 20 team,
threw a punch at Gordon that was caught on video tape.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and Gordon had to be separated after an angry exchange
precipitated by Gordon's complaints that Stewart had not given him
enough room during a Winston Cup practice session in which Stewart
sent Gordon's car spinning with a tap from behind. SCHEDULE
SPECULATION
</P>
<P>
   The green flag has not fallen on the start of the 2000 NASCAR
Winston Cup schedule, so naturally, speculation already is rampant
about the 2001 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   New speedways in Kansas City, Kan., and Joliet, Ill., outside
Chicago, are scheduled to be completed this year, and both are in
markets coveted by NASCAR. Asked where those racetracks might fit
into the 2001 schedule, NASCAR official Mike Helton hinted that the
tracks would be slotted into one of the open weekends remaining on
the 10-month tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already thinking about 2001,'' said Helton, NASCAR's
senior vice president and chief executive officer. ``And as we
start piecing that together, you could look at the 2000 schedule
and see there's only very few holes in it that you could plug races
in. But there are opportunities to plug races in. That's what we'll
be looking at _ how many we can \Radd\S and where they go.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the 2000 schedule as a guideline, there are five open Cup
weekends between Feb. 13 and Nov. 21. After eliminating the
traditional off weekends for Easter Sunday and Mother's Day, that
leaves two open dates in July and one in October. DODGE READIES
LINEUP
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler and Dodge officially will announce the
manufacturer's 2001 Winston Cup lineup during a news conference
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cup crew chief Ray Evernham, who is point man for Dodge's
return to NASCAR's premier series, already has announced that he
will field a two-car team. Speculation is that Petty Enterprises,
whose history with Mopar dates to the glory days of seven-time Cup
champion Richard Petty, will leave Pontiac for the Dodge camp with
Kyle Petty, son Adam, and John Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   The other team rumored to be heading to Dodge is Bill Davis
Racing, which is fielding Pontiacs for Ward Burton and rookie Dave
Blaney. nn

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ No one who has spent much time talking to South
Carolina voters the last couple of days would hazard a guess as to
the likely winner of Saturday's pivotal Republican primary here.
</P>
<P>
   That is because it is so hard to judge exactly who will vote.
All the polls show that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is the heavy
favorite of the Republicans, but Sen. John McCain of Arizona is
preferred by most independents and Democrats, who are free to vote
in the Republican contest, the only one scheduled on Saturday. But
who will turn out? Tough to say, because there is no precise
precedent for the primary.
</P>
<P>
   In detailed conversations with voters in five locations across
the state, from the wealthy enclave of retirees at Hilton Head to
the conservative heartland of Greenville and the upstate region
surrounding it, no clear pattern emerged _ except this: it is an
agonizingly close race, one that often divides best buddies and
married couples. Of 34 people interviewed in Greenville, for
example, where Bush is counted the favorite, 17 said they backed
McCain, 15 said they backed Bush and 2 were unsure.
</P>
<P>
   Among religious conservatives at a Baptist church supper in
Mount Pleasant, an affluent suburb of Charleston, there were solid
pockets of support not only for Bush and McCain but also the third
contender in the race, Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Using much more scientific means, the latest Palmetto Poll,
conducted by Clemson University between Feb. 11 and 17, suggested a
Bush victory by 49 percent to 47 percent if 18.6 percent of
registered voters took part, as they did in the 1996 primary
elections. But if the turnout climbs much above 19 percent, the
poll indicated, the result might well be a McCain victory. The
survey involved 450 people who have been active in elections here
since 1984, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key factor will be turnout,'' said Dave Woodard, a
professor of political science at Clemson. ``It's difficult to
predict turnout because previous elections have featured contests
in both political parties. The absence of a Democratic primary this
year could boost participation by crossover voters in the GOP
contest. That would favor McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, McCain appeals again and again to potential
crossover voters. Thursday, on his campaign bus, he said he wanted
to broaden the Republican Party _ he described it as ``an inclusive
party, the party of Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald
Reagan'' _ in the same way President Clinton had broadened the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In Forest Acres, a Columbia suburb, a significant number of
Reagan Democrats, independents and ticket-splitters said they would
vote for McCain, many despite disagreements with him on issues. In
Hilton Head, some retirees from the Northeast and Midwest spoke of
crossing over.
</P>
<P>
   But in Orangeburg, in the middle of the state, black Democrats _
a bulwark of the South Carolina Democratic party _ said they had no
intention of voting Saturday. Any temptation was eliminated,
several said, by McCain's and Bush's refusal to speak out
unequivocally against displaying the Confederate flag over the
state capitol here in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   All across the state, McCain voters spoke not so much of his
views but of his character. Walter Ferguson, 37, a pastry
distributor in Goose Creek, near Charleston, described McCain as an
anti-Clinton. A Republican, Ferguson commented: ``Clinton puts his
finger to the wind before he decides what to say. Not McCain. He's
not afraid of offending people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's counterattacks here on McCain, the decisive victor in the
New Hampshire primary, are bearing fruit. Elizabeth Thrash, 73, who
reported retiring recently for the third and last time, said she
decided this week to back Bush because she heard that ``McCain has
been married several times'' _ he has been married twice _ and
because she concluded that the senator was ``a bit too liberal for
an ultraconservative like me.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no broad agreement on whether Bush had been helped or
hurt by his parents. Some said his family was a key reason for
backing the governor, but others, like Bill Brent, 70, a Republican
retiree, disagreed. Brent said disdainfully, ``I don't want no
dynasty going on.''

TALE OF MORAL DECAY RAPIDLY LOSES STEAM IN `BOILER ROOM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the opening moments of ``Boiler Room,'' its young
hero-narrator recites some choice examples of the
get-rich-quick-on-stock-options mythology that has created the
great gold-rush sensibility of our time (including the fact that
Microsoft has more ``millionaire secretaries'' than any company in
history).
</P>
<P>
   And for most of its first act, the film shrewdly chronicles the
subtle moral decay that inevitably goes hand in hand with such a
sensibility _ and does it with such enjoyably flamboyant characters
and a deliciously hard-boiled dialogue that the story constantly
verges on being special.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the film falls apart rather badly in its third
act, and ends up being empty, anti-climactic and overlong. Still,
before it fades into nothingness, the film powers along nicely and
proves to be a strong showcase for first-time writer-director Ben
Younger.
</P>
<P>
   It tells the story of Seth Davis (Giovanni Ribisi), a wayward
but highly enterprising _ he runs his own casino _ young man
recruited to work as a stockbroker in a disreputable Long Island
brokerage firm: a boiler room that always operates on the edge of
SEC laws, and sometimes on the other side of them.
</P>
<P>
   The film is essentially a morality tale that follows Seth from
apprenticeship to big success as a broker _ as he learns to
ruthlessly con his clients (and destroy the lives of some of them
in the process) and otherwise compromise himself so that he comes
into increasing conflict with his federal judge father (Ron
Rifkin).
</P>
<P>
   It's a blatant combination of ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' and ``Wall
Street'' (both are generously referenced throughout the film) _
with a slight dash of ``The Firm.'' But it also tries to be unique,
and to address the particular corruption of American society by the
crazed tech-stock boom of the late '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Younger crates a rich tapestry of distinctive
performances, not just from the jaded Ribisi and the almost
frighteningly sanctimonious Rifkin, but also from Ben Affleck (in
perhaps his career-best performance) as an oily company recruiter
and Vin Diesel, Nicky Katt and Tom Everett Scott as a trio of
splendidly sleazy salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Younger also uses a fast-paced, slightly disorienting visual
style (counterpointed by blasts of rap music) that seems just right
for the story; and the kind of witty and evocative dialogue that
manages to reveal character, sum up the milieu and entertain at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   What ``Boiler Room'' does not have is the kind of satisfying
script that can draw us into its train wreck of a story on an
emotional level, and leave us feeling fulfilled by its destination.
Like so many young directors trained on video, Younger could use
the services of a writing partner with the novelistic and
structural skills he so obviously has not yet acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Boiler Room. Directed and written by Ben Younger. Cast: Giovanni
Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Ben Affleck, Ron Rifkin, Nicky Katt, Nia Long.
New Line Cinema. 110 minutes. Rated R for language and some
violence.

`HANGING UP'S' APPEAL IS A MEG RYAN CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your reaction to ``Hanging Up,'' the latest domestic
comedy-drama from the pen of Nora Ephron, will depend largely on
how much you like Meg Ryan. Because, even though she shares the
marquee with four other stars, she's pretty much the whole show.
</P>
<P>
   If you find her distinctive persona to be too irritatingly cute
to bear, this mannered movie is likely to play like fingernails on
a blackboard and drive you straight up the wall.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, you respond to her elfin charm (and I
guess I do), this fourth and probably least inspired Ryan-Ephron
collaboration (after ``When Harry Met Sally ... ,'' ``Sleepless in
Seattle'' and ``You've Got Mail'') gets by, barely.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a novel by Ephron's sister (and writing partner) Delia,
it's the story of three sisters who have to deal with the
incapacitation of their unpleasant and increasingly senile
screenwriter father (Walter Matthau).
</P>
<P>
   The oldest is Georgia (Diane Keaton), a 50ish, self-centered
magazine publisher; the middle sister is Eve (Ryan), a wife and
mother in her 30s with her own party-planning business; and the
youngest is Maddy (Lisa Kudrow), a shallow, Gen-X dilettante and
soap-opera actor.
</P>
<P>
   Eve has always been the closest to her father. The movie follows
her plight as he becomes so mentally unstable that he finally has
to be hospitalized and she has to struggle with the situation while
fighting with her unsupportive husband (Adam Arkin) and trying to
put together a big event at the Nixon Library.
</P>
<P>
   She spends the entire movie in a state of heightened
exasperation, frequently lapsing into painful flashbacks, and
constantly screaming into her cell phone at her two insensitive
sisters, who are more than happy to let her carry the entire burden
of their father's disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   In its lesser scenes, the Keaton and Kudrow characters seem too
contrived and broadly played to believe, and Keaton (who took over
directorial duties from Ephron) has trouble making some of that
very stylized Ephron dialogue work.
</P>
<P>
   In its better scenes, however, the film communicates the anguish
of a domestic trauma that many people face and it has a handful of
warm, tender and funny moments _ most notably Eve's unlikely
friendship with an Iranian doctor (Duke Moosekian) she meets cute
when she crashes into his Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   For Ryan fans, the movie also serves as a strong star vehicle.
Throughout, she's simply radiant _ Howard Atherton's camera is in
love with her _ and her pain and epic frustration in the face of an
overwhelming emotional crisis seems so real that it creates an
exquisite, if fleeting, sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging Up. Directed by Diane Keaton. Screenplay by Delia Ephron
and Nora Ephron. Cast: Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton, Lisa Kudrow, Walter
Matthau. Columbia. 92 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual references
and language.

IF `ROAD WARRIOR' MET `ALIEN,' `PITCH BLACK' WOULD BE THE
OFFSPRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though it's riddled with some of the lamest, dumbest
dialogue imaginable, ``Pitch Black'' is a total guilty pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   It benefits from its Australian outback location and a nice
blend of Aussie talent, including newcomer Radha Mitchell (``Love
and Other Catastrophes'') and seasoned veterans Lewis Fitz-Gerald
(``Breaker Morant'') and Simon Burke (``The Devil's Playground''),
which it mixes with such American actors as Vin Diesel (``Saving
Private Ryan'') and Cole Hauser (``Good Will Hunting'').
</P>
<P>
   And while it borrows heavily from the best in the sci-fi
thriller genre _ Ridley Scott's ``Alien'' _ it has just enough of
its own style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black'' follows that ``Alien's'' formula _ a crew
piloting a spacecraft crash-lands on, this time, a desolate and
arid planet that is warmed to the boiling point by three suns.
</P>
<P>
   Its surviving passengers include a docking pilot (Mitchell); a
cop (Hauser) transporting a dangerous prisoner (Diesel); a Muslim
cleric (Keith David) traveling with his three disciples; an
antiquities dealer (Fitz-Gerald) and a teenage runaway (Rhiana
Griffith).
</P>
<P>
   With limited water and a damaged craft, the group begins to
explore the unknown territory looking for anything to help repair
the ship. They discover a deserted mining camp scattered with
bleached out bones and no sign of life.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, they're about to discover that lack of water
isn't their only problem. Something else is out there; something
that hides from the sunlight and waits for the arrival of new
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Director David Twohy, who has had some luck in the sci-fi genre
_ he did a passable job on the 1996 film ``The Arrival'' _ goes all
out visually, fabricating a terrific look for ``Pitch Black.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the film's flair is culled more from ``The Road
Warrior'' than ``Alien'' and the movie defies categorization into
straight science fiction or action genres. It could be called a
post-apocalyptic thriller and it's desaturated look and ``Mad Max''
mentality make it a fun-to-watch picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black'' tweaks and twists convention just enough to have
an individual pulse. And in doing so it manages to keep our pulses
ats racing, providing enough of a taut, stylishly gripping

&HT;     CANDIDATES DENOUNCE WASHINGTON BUT SPEND MILLIONS TO GET
THERE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the current presidential campaign, this city has
come to resemble a glamorous woman of myriad charms and
questionable virtue who is denounced publicly by men gathering
funds to help them pay for her expensive favors.
</P>
<P>
   A major paradox of the quest for the presidency is that the
contenders are spending millions of dollars to win the White House
while, in their political demagoguery, they describe Washington as
a synonym for evil.
</P>
<P>
   When John McCain decided to stop running negative ads in the
South Carolina primary and challenged George W. Bush to do the
same, Bush rejected the idea, calling it an ``old Washington
trick.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't claim it to be an old Texas or Arizona or California
or New York trick although political chicanery and deceit are not
foreign to those states. He simply indulged in a bit of campaign
hyperbole regarding a city he can't wait to live in.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for a massive tax cut, the governor, who has raised
some $70 million to pay his fare to Washington, claims the
reduction is needed because if the budget surplus is ``left in
Washington, it will be spent.'' Again, Washington is the symbolic
culprit.
</P>
<P>
   He would not let Washington determine his tax cut, Bush said in
his South Carolina debate last week with McCain and Alan Keyes,
because the ``Washington mentality'' is to base such action on
politics and polls rather than the needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
   In vowing to break the Washington ``gridlock'' Bush does not
mention the fact that half of that gridlock is a Congress run by
his own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust Congress I trust the people,'' Bush proclaimed
in South Carolina, ignoring the fact that members of the House and
Senate are the elected representatives of the people.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, has vowed that, if elected, he would break
the ``Washington triangle of big money, lobbyists and
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Bill Bradley, the lanky basketball
legend who served 18 years in the Senate before retiring in 1997,
also has found it profitable, as part of his ``new politics''
campaign, to take some old-politics swats at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Only Al Gore, who as vice president is an integral of the
Washington establishment, has refrained from slamming the city,
although he did find it politically profitable to move his campaign
headquarters to Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's capital is far from an ideal community. It has its
share of crime, double-dealing, graft, sin, waste and lying. Its
most exalted residents have been known to indulge in adultery and
to use the money and power at their disposal to further their
political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   As in other cities _ such as Austin, Phoenix, Sacramento and
Albany _ where governors and legislators jockey for political gain,
partisanship often is the prevailing influence.
</P>
<P>
   Just about every major American business and many foreign
corporations have offices in the Washington area, which encompasses
large sections of Maryland and Virginia. Most of these firms hire
well-paid lobbyists to help them win favors from Congress and the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But, as bad as critics claim it is, Washington is visited by
thousands of eager tourists each year. They clamor to see the White
House, Congress and the fabulous network of museums, art galleries
and memorials that illuminate the city.
</P>
<P>
   When they climb to the top of the Washington Monument, they
thrill at the view below. At the Lincoln Memorial, tears may fill
their eyes as they read the compassionate message of Lincoln's
</P>
<P>
   second inaugural at the end of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jefferson Memorial, they are inspired by the immortal
words of the Declaration of Independence. At the Franklin D.
Roosevelt Memorial, older Americans relive the dramatic moments of
the Great Depression and World War II while younger ones get a
vital lesson in history.
</P>
<P>
   At the Vietnam Memorial people may find the name of a relative
or friend who perished in that horrible war. Across the river, in
Arlington National Cemetery, they may discover the grave of a loved
one who died at Belleau Wood, Anzio, Guadalcanal, the Battle of the
Bulge or in deadly combat in the mountains of Korea, the jungles of
Vietnam and the desert sands of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has decided that there is political gold to be mined in
bludgeoning the nation's capital with vitriolic rhetoric. He rarely
misses an opportunity to announce that his zip code is in Austin
and not Washington.
</P>
<P>
   That is supposed to separate the good guys from the bad guys.
And in Bush's campaign portfolio, Washington is the home of the bad
guys.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of Washington should not be whitewashed. They
should be confronted and solved. Schools and education are in bad
shape. Traffic is horrendous. Crime, though way down, is still
prevalent. Some government employees, like some members of
Congress, have adopted a cavalier attitude toward spending federal
funds.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted, however, that the vast majority of people
living in Washington and its suburbs are decent, hard-working
individuals who are the backbone of our government's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush might ponder the fact that his father spent 20 eventful
years in this city, serving two terms in the House and acting as
chairman of the Republican National Committee, director of the CIA,
Ronald Reagan's vice president and, for four years, as president.
</P>
<P>
   Had it been the evil city his son makes it out to be, the elder
Bush would not have sought a second term as president.

   FOREST ACRES, S.C. _ When Sen. John McCain's campaign decided it
wanted to hold a rally in a Jewish community in South Carolina, it
asked to use the parking lot of the Beth Shalom Synagogue in this
suburb of Columbia. There were a only a few grumblings in the
congregation, said Rabbi Philip Silverstein _ the campaign had
chosen its neighborhood well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an honorable man,'' said Silverstein, who described
himself as a ``Scoop Jackson liberal'' who later became a fan of
Ronald Reagan and is now enthusiastically behind McCain. ``I don't
agree with everything of his _ the campaign finance plan is too
much government. But I was a 20-year military chaplain, and I like
his character. This year, that's the issue behind all issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state dominated by conservatives, it is telling that McCain
wanted to speak to this suburb at all. Few white neighborhoods in
the state can be called liberal, but Forest Acres is full of the
independents, ticket-splitters and Reagan Democrats that McCain
needs to turn out in force if he is to win Saturday's Republican
primary.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with about 30 neighborhood residents, nearly half
said they were non-Republicans who planned to vote in the primary
for McCain, with some voting in a Republican primary for the first
time, taking advantage of its open registration system. Almost
everyone who regularly votes Republican, however, planned to vote
for Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Almost without exception, crossover voters said they disagreed
with many of McCain's positions, particularly his opposition to
abortion. But they dismissed such differences as minor, saying they
admired his character and believed he was more trustworthy than
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want someone who isn't going to lie to me,'' said
Eunice Jacobs, a retiree who was browsing through the
Books-A-Million store in a shopping mall here. ``He seems like
someone who isn't going to mess up the country and make me feel
embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Several McCain supporters made it clear they would not be voting
for him in November. David Waldman, program director of the
Columbia Jewish Community Center, said he would have voted in the
Democratic primary if it had not been canceled. But to exercise his
voting rights, he will choose McCain as the lesser of two
Republican evils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little worried that voters are making him what they want
him to be, in their own mind,'' said Waldman, a Democrat. ``After
all, he's a conservative politician. But at least he isn't the
vapid, empty-headed politician that Bush is.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, however, whether this incorporated suburb, which
voted for Bob Dole in 1996 but elected a Democrat to the state
House of Representatives two years later, has enough independents
and Democrats to counterbalance a large number of Republicans
supporting Bush. In today's unscientific survey here, there were
about an equal number of Bush and McCain voters, but those who plan
to support Bush were much firmer in their conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has the business experience, and that's important,'' said
David James, a pharmaceutical salesman. ``McCain is just a career
politician.
</P>
<P>
   Several people said they liked Bush's family, and admired him as
a ``regular guy'' who seemed to understand them. Only one person
who regularly votes Republican said he was supporting McCain, and
he was the most conservative person interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very pro-life, and he's a real straight talker,'' said
Thomas Davis, who works in the Family Christian Bookstore in the
Columbia Mall. ``If I could, I'd vote for Alan Keyes, but he can't
win, so I'm going with McCain.''  &QL;

AIRLINES ARE INCREASINGLY REPLACING TURBOPROPS WITH REGIONAL JETS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many other airline passengers, Michael Gallagher has gone
out of his way to avoid flying a turboprop plane. When he attended
an Orbital Sciences shareholder meeting a few years ago in
Washington, for example, he changed his schedule at the last minute
to fly on a jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been a nervous flyer,'' said Gallagher, who
lives in Cortland, N.Y. ``On a turboprop plane, you just get
bounced around too much.'' Gallagher and others may soon find an
easier path to a smoother flight. The battle to attract more
passengers from smaller markets has become so intense that airlines
are now scrambling to replace their turboprop planes with jets.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next three years, Continental Airlines will spend
around $2 billion to supplant all its turboprops with regional
jets: twin-engine planes that can carry up to 70 passengers. Delta
Air Lines will pay $4 billion for 200 regional jets and start
service to 100 cities.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every major airline is stocking its fleet with
regional jets. According to estimates by PaineWebber, American,
Continental, United and Northwest Airlines will more than double
the number of regional jets operated by their feeder airlines in
the next three years, giving passengers in smaller markets more
flight choices than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The orders are going primarily to the two big makers of regional
jets, Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica, or Embraer, of Brazil and
Bombardier of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Though the average regional jet costs $20 million, nearly double
the price of a comparable turboprop, the airlines feel the switch
is well worth it. ``Turboprop planes are not an attractive
product,'' said Leo F. Mullin, chief executive of Delta.
``Passengers view them as second-rate service. With a regional jet,
passengers are more comfortable, and we can use them to serve more
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   An informal survey by Delta recently found that its passengers
hate turboprops so much that most are willing to drive two to five
hours to avoid flying in them. Most major carriers depend heavily
on their regional fleets for feeder traffic _ passengers from a
smaller market who connect to the major carrier at a hub airport.
American Airlines, a unit of AMR, and Delta, for example, each
receive about $1 billion in annual revenue from their regional
fleets.
</P>
<P>
   There will still be a place for turboprops, primarily on short
flights provided by independent regional carriers. At the end of
last year, in fact, there were about 1,350 turboprops in use
compared with about 410 regional jets, according to the Regional
Airline Association.
</P>
<P>
   The switch to regional jets _ R.J.'s in airline lingo _ should,
however, significantly increase the major airlines' sales in
smaller and midsize markets.
</P>
<P>
   Turboprops have a flight span of only 500 miles, about half that
of regional jets, which can serve markets that had been beyond a
turboprop's reach. They are also cheaper to operate on longer
routes. They are expected to attract passengers close to small
airports who have been reluctant to fly primarily because of a fear
of turboprops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing about regional jets is not that they are
more cost efficient than turboprops,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an
airlines analyst with PaineWebber. ``The airlines expect to get
more revenue from regional jets by selling more seats in what is a
preferred product.''
</P>
<P>
   The major carriers also hope to swap larger jets with regional
jets on flights that do not sell out. But that is not likely to
become a common practice anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Airline Pilots Association, which covers most major carriers
in the United States and Canada, is so fearful that regional jets
could take work away from its members that most labor contracts
with the airlines restrict how many such aircraft an airline can
own as well as the number of seats on each plane. After receiving
its shipments for 26 new regional jets next year, for instance,
United Airlines, a unit of UAL, will not be able to buy another
without permission from its pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the pilots' resistance and other barriers could be
overcome, the airlines would like to develop ``on-demand
dispatch,'' industry code for a last-minute equipment swap. If a
flight from La Guardia to Chicago on a Boeing 737 was, say, only a
quarter full, the airline could substitute a regional jet and avoid
losing money on unsold seats. Such a swap, of course, is likely to
irritate passengers who prefer the larger jets.
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives are confident, however, that regional jets
will become popular alternatives to their propellered predecessors,
though there is less consensus on exactly what constitutes a
regional jet. Most industry executives agree that its flight span
is 1,000 miles or less, but they are less clear on the number of
seats the plane can contain. Some said regional jets could have as
many as 100 seats, while others deferred to their pilots'
contracts, many of which dictate a total of no more than 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``The definition of a regional jet can get fuzzy,'' said Tom
Bacon, a senior vice president for marketing and planning at
American Eagle, the regional carrier of American Airlines. ``But
we're beginning to think of regional jets in terhe new
service with the cities that we can connect.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of passengers on regional jets has already begun to
surge, increasing 20 percent in the first nine months of 1999 over
the corresponding period a year earlier, according to the Regional
Airline Association. The number of seats available increased 18.2
percent, while the length of the average trip rose 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passengers have clearly decided that they do not want to fly
on turboprop planes,'' said Susan Donofrio, an airline analyst at
Deutsche Banc. Alex. Brown. ``But the regional jets offer other
advantages. The airlines can make sure that they have quality
feeder service. When passengers start a trip, they are more likely
to stay on that airline to make connections.''
</P>
<P>
   In the scramble to gain more passengers from smaller cities, the
regional jet is fast becoming the airlines' most effective weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives have known for decades that passengers
avoided turboprops like the flu, but used them anyway, in part
because second-tier cities were not important enough for the $20
million capital investment required to buy a new regional jet.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, however, markets that were once shunned as
too small have grown rapidly. And executives from these smaller
markets had the same turboprop complaints as their big-city
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the perception among some passengers that turboprops
are not safe,'' said Glen Hauenstein, the vice president for
scheduling at Continental. ``Turboprops vibrate and the passengers
can see the propellers. ''
</P>
<P>
   (The rate of accidents involving turboprops in 1996, the latest
year statistics are available, was small, only 3.62 for every
100,000 miles flown, but more than twice the accident rate of
turbojets, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.)
</P>
<P>
   Regional jets can also fly farther, faster and more smoothly
than turboprops. But even more important for attracting passengers
from smaller but growing cities is that the airlines can use them
to create more nonstop flights. Executives, who buy only 20 percent
of the airlines' tickets but account for about half of the industry
profits, avoid multistop flights as much as they shun turboprops.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw in some of our markets was that the flight was
just too long for a turboprop,'' Bacon of American Eagle said. ``A
turboprop could have made it from Boston to Norfolk, but it would
not have been competitive service. Some of our competitors would
have offered a nonstop flight.''

<P>
   An example of the scuffling over smaller markets has been
playing out in Greenville-Spartanburg, an area of two counties with
about 650,000 people in the South Carolina foothills. In the last
10 years, the area has become a manufacturing mecca, where
Michelin, the French tire maker, is planning a big expansion and
where roadsters are built for BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The area was served primarily by Delta, through its hub in
Atlanta, until Continental began nonstop Continental Express
service to Newark from Greenville a few years ago and then between
Greenville and Houston. The combination of more flights from the
Northeast and an opening to the West lured many passengers away
from Delta. Within a year, Delta's share of the
Greenville-Spartanburg market plunged from 84 percent to 23
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has not taken its massacre in Greenville-Spartanburg
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Through its regional fleet, Delta Connection, it has begun an
aggressive push to expand its presence in smaller markets. After
spending $2.6 billion last year to buy two of its regional carriers
_ Comair and Atlantic Southeast Airlines _ Delta recently replaced
American Eagle as the nation's largest regional carrier, according
to the Regional Airline Association.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, Delta Connection will own more regional
jets than any other airline. And it is wasting no time deploying
them. The airline recently started service between Worcester,
Mass., and nine cities, including Denver, Atlanta and Myrtle Beach,
S.C. Within the next two months, it will start regional jet service
with daily flights from La Guardia to six cities, including
Richmond and Savannah, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens with a regional jet is that you can give some
smaller cities big-market access,'' said Frederick W. Reid, Delta's
chief marketing officer. ``The next step in our expansion will be
to start connecting some of the smaller cities with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The connections are some of the least expensive deals the
airlines have been able to make. Because they are very fuel
efficient once they reach cruising altitude, regional jets cost
only 10 cents an air mile on longer routes, those that are 500 to
1,000 miles long, compared with 19 cents for turboprops.
(Turboprops are, however, a lot less expensive to operate on
shorter hops.)
</P>
<P>
   When replacing larger jets, regional jets can also save money at
the gate. Delta said it could park three regional jets in the space
that it uses to park, say, a 737. Analysts estimate that could
reduce gate fees by some 10 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Delta recently made such a swap on its routes between Atlanta
and Grand Rapids, Mich., after too many seats on the 737s were left
unfilled. To draw more people, Delta added three daily flights.
</P>
<P>
   Given the advantages of regional jets, airline executives may
soon be more irked that they cannot deploy more. But they are not
likely to press the sensitive issue too hard, at least for now,
with the airline pilots unions.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the love affair with regional jets is not shared by
some passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fly turboprops or regional jets,'' said Paul Tauger, a
lawyer in Costa Mesa, Calif. ``I took a regional jet from Fort
Lauderdale to Dallas, and the luggage compartment was not big
enough for my carry-on bag. After that, with airplanes, I don't
downsize anymore.''

headquarters to Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's capital is far from an ideal community. It has its
share of crime, double-dealing, graft, sin, waste and lying. Its
most exalted residents have been known to indulge in adultery and
to use the money and power at their disposal to further their
political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   As in other cities _ such as Austin, Phoenix, Sacramento and
Albany _ where governors and legislators jockey for political gain,
partisanship often is the prevailing influence.
</P>
<P>
   Just about every major American business and many foreign
corporations have offices in the Washington area, which encompasses
large sections of Maryland and Virginia. Most of these firms hire
well-paid lobbyists to help them win favors from Congress and the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But, as bad as critics claim it is, Washington is visited by
thousands of eager tourists each year. They clamor to see the White
House, Congress and the fabulous network of museums, art galleries
and memorials that illuminate the city.
</P>
<P>
   When they climb to the top of the Washington Monument, they
thrill at the view below. At the Lincoln Memorial, tears may fill
their eyes as they read the compassionate message of Lincoln's
</P>
<P>
   second inaugural at the end of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jefferson Memorial, they are inspired by the immortal
words of the Declaration of Independence. At the Franklin D.
Roosevelt Memorial, older Americans relive the dramatic moments of
the Great Depression and World War II while younger ones get a
vital lesson in history.
</P>
<P>
   At the Vietnam Memorial people may find the name of a relative
or friend who perished in that horrible war. Across the river, in
Arlington National Cemetery, they may discover the grave of a loved
one who died at Belleau Wood, Anzio, Guadalcanal, the Battle of the
Bulge or in deadly combat in the mountains of Korea, the jungles of
Vietnam and the desert sands of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has decided that there is political gold to be mined in
bludgeoning the nation's capital with vitriolic rhetoric. He rarely
misses an opportunity to announce that his zip code is in Austin
and not Washington.
</P>
<P>
   That is supposed to separate the good guys from the bad guys.
And in Bush's campaign portfolio, Washington is the home of the bad
guys.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of Washington should not be whitewashed. They
should be confronted and solved. Schools and education are in bad
shape. Traffic is horrendous. Crime, though way down, is still
prevalent. Some government employees, like some members of
Congress, have adopted a cavalier attitude toward spending federal
funds.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted, however, that the vast majority of people
living in Washington and its suburbs are decent, hard-working
individuals who are the backbone of our government's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush might ponder the fact that his father spent 20 eventful
years in this city, serving two terms in the House and acting as
chairman of the Republican National Committee, director of the CIA,
Ronald Reagan's vice president and, for four years, as president.
</P>
<P>
   Had it been the evil city his son makes it out to be, the elder
Bush would not have sought a second term as president.

COZYING UP TO LABOR, GORE VOWS TO SHIFT CHINA TRADE POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ In seeking to please organized labor and inspire
it to work hard for his election, Vice President Al Gore could
become a potent weapon against his own administration.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders meeting here said that behind closed doors
Thursday, Gore had reiterated his pledge that if he is elected
president, he will negotiate a tougher trade agreement with China
than President Clinton has. He also said he would include labor and
environmental matters in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did say that he favored the admission of China to the World
Trade Organization and that he wanted Congress to give Clinton's
agreement the green light. And his spokesman said he would do
whatever Clinton asked him to do to prod Congress toward approving
normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   But the message that organized labor, which has endorsed Gore,
received was this: The vice president favors their view that any
agreement should include labor and environmental matters.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders emerged from their session with him with what
appeared a nod and wink: While they did not expect Gore to be
disloyal to his president, they said, they did expect that his
preference for a tougher agreement could help them defeat Clinton's
efforts to remove trade barriers against the Chinese. At the least,
they said, it could delay a vote, now set for this summer, until an
agreement could be renegotiated by a Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see that it's delayed, because we will be
better off,'' said George Becker, president of the United
Steelworkers Union, after the session between Gore and the nearly
50 members of the executive council of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to give a Gore administration the opportunity to
deal with this,'' he said. ``In any agreement that goes forward in
a Gore administration, we expect to have enforceable labor rights
and human rights into the core agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   As the showdown over the trade vote in Congress nears, Gore's
delicate balancing act _ as a presidential candidate in favor of
one kind of agreement, and the vice president of an administration
that is promoting another _ is coming into sharper focus.
</P>
<P>
   The situation prompted some delicately chosen wording Thursday
as both labor and the Gore campaign attempted to explain the vice
president's dual aims.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference between being No. 1 and No. 2 ,'' John
J. Sweeney, president of the federation, said jovially after the
private session.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has said that he supports the president and
the president's position,'' Sweeney said. ``But he did say, and he
said it in Los Angeles, that when he's president, he will support
core labor standards and environmental protections as part of our
trade agreements. Essentially, we know what he means, and he knows
what we support.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Harnage, president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, said: ``He's not going to say anything
against Clinton. He's a gentleman, and he's there to support
Clinton. But there's been times that he's disagreed with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not make himself available to reporters Thursday. But
Chris Lehane, his spokesman, put it this way: ``He's still vice
president and will do whatever he can to help the president. But
having said that, he also said that in future trade agreements, we
will make it more open for labor, environment and human-rights
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers Union, had
another formulation: ``We're not putting any pressure on him, we're
not putting him under the gun at all. We've taken a position as a
labor movement in the United States that we're fighting permanent
most-favored nation agreement with China and we're going to see
that that's beaten. We expect different treatment from the Gore
administration, and we trust him, we believe him and we'll get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, labor does wield a big stick. The federation has
endorsed Gore and is putting its muscle behind his race for the
Democratic presidential nomination against former Senator Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is well aware that labor may have made the difference in
his early victories against Bradley. Labor officials said that the
union vote in the Democratic contests so far had been pivotal for
Gore _ accounting for about a third of the Democratic vote in Iowa
and a fourth in New Hampshire _ and that it would be crucial in the
March 7 primaries, particularly in New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Thursday's meeting, Gore thanked the labor leaders
profusely for their work on his behalf, and acknowledged their
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very firm in there that he is for the agreement, but
also extremely laudatory about what they had done for him,'' Lehane
said.

PLAYING IT THE COMPANY WAY, AFTER HOURS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Texas, Wis.)   (af)  
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Management at the Bank of America thought it had a winner. In a
program called ``Adopt an ATM,'' begun last June, the bank asked
employees to volunteer to look after one of its automated teller
machines and to keep its surroundings gleaming with pride _ on
their own time and without pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was a great idea,'' said Kieth Cockrell,
executive vice president in Charlotte, N.C., of the bank's credit,
debit and smart-card division, which oversaw the program. More than
2,800 of the bank's 158,900 workers signed up to adopt a specific
ATM in much the same way that companies and organizations adopt
public roads.
</P>
<P>
   But when Marcy V. Saunders, the California state labor
commissioner, read about it, she hit the ceiling. She wrote to the
bank, saying the program seemed to her in clear violation of
``basic precepts of wage and hour law'' and demanding that the
volunteers be paid or that the program be discontinued within 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   The bank met with Ms. Saunders to see if it could satisfy her
objections, but eventually suspended the program, instead setting
up a toll-free number for employees to report problems at ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if asking employees to work for nothing was legal, though,
the program raised important ethical questions about the nature of
the company-employee relationship. Not least is the issue of
reciprocity. Does an employer that counts on its workers to further
its interests during their off hours, gratis, have a right to
discipline workers who handle personal business during office
hours?
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies feel perfectly free to infringe upon employees'
time, while not necessarily being extremely flexible when it comes
to employees' demand for time,'' said Daryl Koehn, director of the
Center for Business Ethics at the University of St. Thomas in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   On this front, Bank of America's policy is fairly vague. ``In
our code of ethics,'' said Ann L. DeFabio, a bank spokeswoman,
``basically it just says that the proper use of Bank of America
assets is essential to the financial soundness and integrity of the
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not likely that a giant bank would see much
equivalence between, say, employees' using company postage to pay
personal bills and using their own paper towels to clean ATM
screens.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common ethical disconnect. Most businesses think nothing
of expecting extra miles from employees, and are shocked when they
are called on it. They automatically think of the employee's
commitment to the company as open-ended, but draw a sharp line
around the company's commitment to the employee.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics see cynical, deliberate exploitativeness in such
attitudes, but by and large I don't doubt the employers' good
intentions, just their logic. Still, plans like ``Adopt an ATM''
bespeak a patronizing arrogance, an assumption that company pride
is reason enough for employees to give and give some more _ and
never mind whether the company gives anything back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often the leaders really are doing what they think is in
the best interests of the company,'' said Michelle L. Reina,
co-author of ``Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace.''
(Berrett-Kohler, 1999) ``They do at times tend to forget the
individuals involved. When they get the type of response they're
getting in this particular case, they are caught off guard. And at
times they feel betrayed in response.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, such indignation might seem justified. ``From an
ethical perspective, Bank of America is doing nothing wrong'' with
the program itself, said Laura P. Hartman, a professor of business
ethics at the University of Wisconsin. ``The ethical issues come up
where there is undue influence of an inappropriate nature.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a potentially fatal flaw inherent in any ``voluntary''
program handed down from management, particularly one tied to
company business: there is subtle coercion just in asking, because
some employees won't feel free to say no, regardless of how big the
word ``voluntary'' is on the flier.
</P>
<P>
   If there is truly a wellspring of pride and respect within an
organization, management should have known that few employees would
leave the ATM they use looking untidy, ``adopted'' or not. If that
pride isn't there to begin with, no ``voluntary'' program from on
high can synthesize it, and it's unfair to employees to try. &QL;

SOUNDTRACK'S GREAT BUT `LITTLE RICHARD' IS SADLY LACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the credits for ``Little Richard,'' the biographical film
airing Sunday night on NBC, Little Richard is listed as executive
producer. It must be a courtesy title, though, cuz, good golly, if
the ``architect of rock 'n' roll'' really had a hand in the
technical side of this biopic, he'd have made sure the extras could
walk and chew gum at the same time, no?
</P>
<P>
   As seems to be the case with so many of these rock-music
retrospectives passing as in-depth biographies, the adoring fans of
the rock stars apparently flunked out of the I've Got Rhythm School
of Remedial Finger-snapping. This is largely a flaw in film
editing, in synchronizing the actors' movements to the beat of the
soundtrack. But, really, how difficult is it to make the audience
keep time with the music? Or are we expected to believe Little
Richard's frantic approach to popular music was so far ahead of its
time that mere mortals in his entourage couldn't possibly tap their
toes that fast?
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Richard'' isn't the first such TV movie to suffer
out-of-sync-osis. But to be guilty of it in a film about someone
whose career was rooted in the raucous rhythms of deep-South gospel
music is a-wop-bop-a-loser move.
</P>
<P>
   Even stranger is the decision to end the story in 1962, when
Little Richard successfully returned to the concert stage after a
five-year hiatus during which he devoted his considerable energies
to religious studies and the ministry. True, his biggest hits were
behind him at that point, but to highlight only the first 30 years
suggests Little Richard may have had a little too much influence on
the conceptual side of this project.
</P>
<P>
   Leon, the artist formerly known as Leon Robinson, plays Little
Richard. Viewers may remember him as the free-spirited David Ruffin
in last year's NBC miniseries, ``The Temptations.'' (If Leon is
thinking of making this rock 'n' roll movie thing a career, I'd
like to put in my vote for Ben E. King and the Drifters as his next
project).
</P>
<P>
   Now, if ever there was a free spirit in rock 'n' roll, it was
Richard Wayne Penniman, the Macon, Ga., boy with a gift for music,
an abiding love of makeup and a flair for the theatrical. ``Little
Richard'' touches on all of that, but it touches ever so gently,
going only as deep as a light layer of pancake, leaving us with
something as ephemeral as a 2{-minute Top-40 single, as meaningful
as the lyrics to ``Tutti Frutti.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon is certainly energetic as Little Richard, but incapable of
providing much insight because of a script that is fearful of doing
anything more than providing the barest facts. The film hints at
the struggle behind the success, the pain behind the glory, but
every time the story gets interesting, the music starts.
</P>
<P>
   The music is good, too. But this makes ``Little Richard'' as
rewarding as a touring Broadway musical, which isn't bad if you're
looking for hummable tunes but deadly if you're looking for a
provocative story about an effeminate black singer trying to make
it in an industry dominated by white men comfortable with
eccentricity only if it makes them rich.
</P>
<P>
   Even Little Richard's struggle with his own conscience over
whether to serve God or devote his life to what his father (Carl
Lumbly) and his pastor (Garrett Morris) called the devil's music _
a pretty fair premise for a movie _ gets buried under the
``Bandstand''-like playlist.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. There's a good story lurking here. But the best we can
give ``Little Richard'' is a 70 because the melody is pretty but
the words leave something to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   Little Richard. Two-hour TV movie about the rock 'n' roll
legend. Starring Leon, Tamala Jones, Jennifer Lewis, Carl Lumbly
and Garrett Morris. Sunday night on NBC. Parental guideline rating:
TV-14.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Douglas Berman, the chairman of Bill
Bradley's presidential campaign, was strolling into a hotel bar
late one evening recently when he spotted three reporters assigned
to cover Bradley. Months ago, there might have been a dozen or more
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you're the only ones left?'' Berman said with a glum laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Gallows humor has come to the campaign Bradley once described as
``a joyous journey.'' After losses to Vice President Al Gore in
Iowa and New Hampshire, and with Gore widening his double-digit
lead in almost every recent poll, there is a deepening sense of
gloom among some of Bradley's staunchest supporters. At times, even
Bradley seems to be grasping for answers as to why his campaign
seems stuck in neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what happens in these things,'' he said in an
interview this week. ``If you do a poll afterward and ask people
how they'd made up their minds, you could take the data and devise
five different explanations.''
</P>
<P>
   Though poker-faced and hard to read, Bradley has shown flashes
of frustration in recent days that suggest he is not pleased with
his position. In a recent news conference he expressed his dismay
with the news media's portrayal of his struggling campaign, saying,
``I don't have perfect communication with the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been particularly exasperating for Bradley and his aides
to watch Sen. John McCain swiftly close a once yawning gap with
Gov. George W. Bush in the Republican race. McCain's stunning
victory in New Hampshire, in fact, was attributable in part to his
growing support among independents and Democrats, whom Bradley had
courted aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   And that helped produce an avalanche of media attention that
Bradley's aides contend has relegated the Democratic race to a
sideshow, slowing Bradley at a crucial moment in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly McCain is getting the kind of press that Bradley
should be getting,'' said State Sen. Richard Codey of New Jersey, a
friend and supporter of Bradley. ``When we came within a few points
of beating a sitting vice president in New Hampshire, we should
have been on the cover of Time and Newsweek.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley clearly seems to share that sentiment. He argues that a
major reason McCain has taken off in the polls, while he has not,
is that Gov. George W. Bush had until recently not engaged in the
kind of negative campaigning that Gore has waged since last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an atmosphere where he wasn't getting attacked,''
Bradley said in the interview. ``George W. Bush didn't attack him.
And I think he had a free sail.''
</P>
<P>
   But did that mean that negative campaigning works? Bradley, who
has criticized ``the old politics of 1,000 attacks,'' paused,
briefly troubled by the question. ``I don't know,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better symbol of the difference between his campaign
and McCain's than the way they travel. McCain rides in a bus packed
with reporters. On Thursday, Bradley rode in a 54-seat bus with
only three aides, while reporters followed in a separate vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are no visible signs of panic within Bradley's
inner circle. Unlike Gore or Bush, who retreated to their
headquarters for urgent strategy sessions when their campaigns were
foundering, Bradley continues to trudge ahead, suggesting strongly
that he will make no radical changes to his game plan before March
7, when more than a dozen states hold primaries that will elect
about a third of the delegates needed for nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Gore seems to be widening his lead in polls, Bradley
said he considered it ``a bump from New Hampshire'' that would soon
dissipate. He asserted that most voters in states that hold March 7
primaries, including New York and California, are not paying
attention yet, giving him time to win them over.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the campaign has been opening new offices in key
cities each week and using its ample war chest to bombard select
states, including Ohio, New York, California and Missouri, with
television commercials. To build his name recognition, Bradley has
been doing a dozen or more interviews a day with local news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 18 points back in New Hampshire, and we lost by 4,''
he said. ``So I'm not prepared to say that things can't happen very
quickly. They can happen very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Having been occasionally criticized for not campaigning
energetically, Bradley has also begun packing his days with rallies
and media events, crisscrossing New York state by plane on Tuesday,
driving by bus through Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But his events sometimes have a meandering feel to them. On
Thursday, for instance, Bradley spent two hours in a high school
gym in Providence, R.I., where he spoke to several hundred people
about the values he learned playing basketball and then shot hoops
with the girls' and boys' teams. (Bradley and two girls played a
shooting game against three boys. But his team lost, largely
because of Bradley who, despite his Hall of Fame skills, went 2 for
9.)
</P>
<P>
   The event provided Bradley an opportunity to campaign in a black
community _ a vital Democratic voting group _ and provided
energetic images of him in a sweat suit for local television. But
he did not mention Gore once, failing to draw the kinds of sharp
contrasts that could sway undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even some of his supporters seemed puzzled by the gentle tenor
of the event. ``Bradley's got to go negative on Gore,'' said
Wilfred LeHoullier, 72. ``But he just can't seem to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley insists, however, that he will be sharpening the
distinctions between him and Gore on issues of importance to
Democrats, particularly health care, education, gun control and
abortion. He also said he would step up his criticism of
fund-raising abuses by the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996, asserting
that Gore's involvement should disqualify him for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Democrats don't want to hear that, but it's true,''
he said in the interview. ``The message that you would communicate
is that this is the way politics has always been: take and get,
quid pro quo's, and money plays a role in everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Using some of his rawest language yet in describing his rival,
Bradley ridiculed Gore as ``the co-opt kid'' who stole his ideas
and oratory even as he criticized him. He also called Gore ``a
risk'' to the Democratic Party who would inevitably be rejected by
an electorate suffering from a sense of Clinton fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   And he accused the vice president of undermining the goal of
universal health care _ a core Democratic principle, he said _ by
relentlessly berating Bradley's own proposal to extend private
health insurance to almost all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he demeans universal health insurance, he's making it
less likely that we achieve universal health care as a country,''
Bradley said. ``It's not me or my candidacy, but what he does with
his divisiveness to injure the body politics, to injure the
prospects of anybody doing good things.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a rare moment, Bradley acknowledged that Gore's withering
attacks on him had probably weakened his support, saying the vice
president had ``clouded the waters.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley plugs on gamely, many of his most loyal supporters
have been growing increasingly melancholy about his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends are becoming resigned to a Gore victory,''
said David Loebsack, a professor of political science at Cornell
College in Iowa, who was one of Bradley's grass-roots organizers in
that state. ``They are frustrated with the lack of movement on the
Bradley front.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in New York, once considered Bradley's strongest big state
_ he played basketball for the Knicks for 10 seasons _ some of
Bradley's friends are worrying about his chances of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the momentum the vice president's got certainly does
not bode well,'' said State Assemblyman Alexander P. Grannis, a
Manhattan Democrat who is helping Bradley. ``People still like
Bradley. But they wonder whether he has it in him to wage this kind
of fight. And now Gore looks stronger, so Bradley looks weaker.''

LET THE SUN SHINE IN, AND INSTALL A SUPERFAST LINE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By ABBY ELLIN

<P>
   Back in the '60s, ``commune'' was often synonymous with yoga and
free love. Inhabitants shared political beliefs, a desire to save
the whales, or maybe a penchant for Tofu Surprise. They thought
globally and acted locally.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, a far different commune is in vogue. Call it
the e-commune, a community of real, live people who share a
fascination with all things digital. People who bond over
broadband. People who realize that it can be mighty lonely in the
cool glow of a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the '90s were about imbibing virtual beers in virtual
bars, the experience of these groups suggests that the new decade
could be about how some virtual communities can be transformed into
real ones.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, a Stanford University study concluded that the
more time people spend on the Internet, the lonelier they become.
For some people, e-communes may be the antidote. If their residents
tend to be shy types, they at least feel more comfortable turning
outward in the company of others like themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the eight members of the nonprofit World Peace Through
Technology Tour. They live and work in a 4,000-square-foot
warehouse in San Francisco, sharing bills, a DSL (digital
subscriber line), two bathrooms and a shower. Their mission is to
``travel around the world, do live netcasts from remote places and
demonstrate `benevolent technologies,''' showing people how
computers can help them, said Brad Olsen, 33, the group's director.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid '90s, looser e-communes of more profit-oriented
people were already thriving near Silicon Valley, in the coastal
city of Santa Cruz, which in some ways is still a hippie haven.
These e-communes were occupied by students from the University of
California at Santa Cruz, where they were called ``geek houses,''
the computer nerd's version of a fraternity house.
</P>
<P>
   The students rented huge homes _ with hot tubs, swimming pools
and garages _ and digitized them. No niche was left unwired, said
Terry Coates, 29, who resided in three different geek houses from
1994 to 1998, including one called the Marshmallow Peanut Circus, a
six-bedroom, bright orange house that he shared with eight others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were wireless intercoms in every room and an electronic
blackboard system throughout the house where people could leave
messages''from their computers on a central computer screen, Coates
recalled by phone from Carmel, Calif., where he now sells homes.
``We ordered pizzas and paid bills online. I could flick a switch
from my bed and start the shower. We downloaded CDs into the
computer with 33 gigs of hard drive space, so you could have 1,000
hours of music. We were ahead of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many former inhabitants of geek houses have since founded their
own companies or gone to work for major corporations like Cisco
Systems and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   In more urban settings, e-communes can thrive nowadays in
apartment buildings. Jason Tavis Jeffries, 28, whose motto is
``Think globally, click locally,'' lives in a four-story, former
girdle factory in Brooklyn, New York. Last fall, the building was
transformed into apartments _ a metamorphosis that, through word of
Web, attracted many people who design Web sites or work in related
fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's really young,'' Jeffries said. ``On moving-in day,
people left their doors open and were borrowing each others' tools.
It was just like a college dorm.''
</P>
<P>
   With his landlord's blessing, Jeffries, a senior developer at a
Web company in Manhattan and the founder of billburg.com, a
community Web site in Williamsburg, installed a high-speed DSL
connection. Jeffries paid for the line; others rent access to it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At his suggestion, the landlord built a free public-access Web
kiosk on the first floor: two computer terminals are encased in a
cast-iron sculpture of a potbellied stove, designed by a local
artist to echo a time when people would gather to warm themselves
at the general store. ``Today, they gather 'round the Net,''
Jeffries said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he opened the Verb Cafe on the first floor, complete
with high speed Internet access, a swipe coffee card (which, like a
prepaid phone card, works through a card reader, with the cost of
each cup automatically deducted) and an online jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet, in its nascent form, is a misused novelty,''
Jeffries said. ``It has much more of a utilitarian value on a local
scale than on a global scale.''
</P>
<P>
   At Walden Internet Village in the Westchase area of Houston, the
theme was planned from the start. One of three such complexes built
three years ago by James M. Birney, a local developer, the 200-unit
village is home to nearly 400 Web-heads: think Microsoft meets
Delta House. About 85 percent of the residents are men; the age
range is generally 23 to 35. Nearly every apartment has access to a
superfast T3 data line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thesis is that your time in college was cool, except you
had to go to school and you had no money,'' said Alan LeFort, 27,
the chief technology officer of the complex. ``Now that you're out
of school and making money, you may still have that frat-house
approach to life.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry, Mom. ``They're not getting drunk out of their
skulls _ there's a real bond here beyond partying,'' LeFort said.
``The Internet is the common link that brings them together. Later
on, they develop friendships based on other things.''
</P>
<P>
   When a resident was laid off from his job a year ago, his
neighbors chipped in for groceries and rent. They also helped him
find another job. Another man who had a $40,000 salary when he
moved in, soon learned from others what he was worth. ``He now
makes $75,000,'' LeFort said.
</P>
<P>
   At night, residents hang out at the village's Internet Cafe,
which has a 10-foot-high video projection screen, a 100-watt sound
system and a Sega Dreamcast game machine _ ``all the geeky toys you
wish you could own,'' LeFort said.
</P>
<P>
   Walden Internet Village also offers Spanish classes, Web
training programs and group ``Star Trek'' viewings. Even a
potentially ho-hum New Year's Eve _ after all, the majority of the
residents were on Y2K alert _ turned into fun: residents streamed
digital music through laptops and into speakers set up for a party
near the pool.
</P>
<P>
   But do the residents really want to breathe the same air and
share the same cyberspace day in and day out?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently so. ``Most of the guys were introverted when they
moved in,'' LeFort said. ``But by bringing them together as a group
they have no fear. They're not afraid to go out because they have
the security of a group. Twenty-two guys are going to Mardi Gras
together.''
</P>
<P>
   And who knows? The Mardi Gras group next year might not be all
guys. More women have begun moving in. As LeFort put it, ``We're
getting a reputation as a place to find a good husband.''

AN ONLINE MATCHMAKER OF ATHLETES AND SCHOOLS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.Y., Wash.)   (af)  
 By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When someone makes a big profit on Wall Street,
traders like to say, ``Don't confuse brains with a bull market.''
And when a corporate climber in most any field hits a home run,
business friends are apt to attribute it to being in the right
place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   But for Lisa Henderson, 37, founder of LevelEdge.com, an
Internet service that matches young athletes with colleges and
scholarships, it took nearly 20 years for her own lucky break on
the high school playing fields to germinate into a hot business
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   That business _ solidly financed and widely praised, though
still unproven _ demonstrates how well some entrepreneurs can reach
back into their pasts for the Big Idea. For all the material
rewards of success, venture capitalists say, it is business
founders with a profound motivation to change the world, or at
least a portion of it, who are the most successful. Henderson,
considering herself lucky, wants to create such kismet for others.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's break came in 1980, when she was a high school
senior of modest means in the small town of Pontoon, Ill., near St.
Louis. Two girlfriends invited her to watch their preseason soccer
tournament at Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Mo. When the
team suddenly ran short of players, someone tossed Lisa a jersey
and sent her onto the field. She scored two goals, prompting the
coach to offer her a $2,000 scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, was not enough money to send Henderson to
college. So the coach set up tryouts on the basketball and softball
teams, and she got offers of $4,000 more in sports scholarships.
After selling her car, Ms. Henderson had enough money to enroll. In
the next five years she earned a bachelor's degree in finance, an
MBA and the school's ``athlete of the year'' award.
</P>
<P>
   Recruited directly out of college by Ralston-Purina as a
marketing research analyst, she spent five years working her way up
to brand manager and introducing products from the company's
headquarters in St. Louis. In 1992, she moved to San Francisco to
run the Mexico operation of Del Monte; a year later, she became an
executive vice president at Specialty Brands, which sells spices
and food ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Ms. Henderson made the leap to technology, joining the
software developer Autodesk as head of its consumer products
division. Seeing firsthand how the Internet could break down
economic and geographic barriers, she began thinking about going
into business for herself.
</P>
<P>
   She often talked to friends and colleagues about young people
who were not able to fulfill their potential because of where or
how they had grown up. ``Kids like me are invisible,'' she said.
``And we're forced to rely on luck as a means of getting a good
education.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1998, Henderson wrote a business plan for LevelEdge, a
start-up that would use computer technology to match promising high
school and junior college athletes with four-year colleges and
universities. The company is intended as an alternative to the
unseemly practices that Henderson and others feel are widely
prevalent in the college athlete recruiting process.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, LevelEdge is a clearinghouse, allowing its subscribers
to get a broad view of prospective graduates and promising athletes
without an intermediary who might take advantage of unsuspecting
families.
</P>
<P>
   Living in the shadow of Silicon Valley, Henderson didn't need
long to round up $2.7 million in seed capital and recruit such
high-visibility investors as the retired tennis champion Billie
Jean King, who has since become co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``LevelEdge shares my vision of providing equal opportunities
across the board for athletes,'' King said in an interview. ``I
came up through the public parks system, not the country club, and
it's much tougher if you're not part of a highly visible program.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The service has also attracted support from coaches. ``I will
subscribe to LevelEdge because it will allow me to find talent that
may have otherwise been unknown to me,'' said Scott Thompson, the
men's basketball coach at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henderson wants to raise the visibility of all student
athletes. ``Everyone knows the top 50 players for each position,''
she said. ``Only there are 21 million high school students, and 33
percent play sports.''
</P>
<P>
   While most students and parents know how to fill out college
applications, she added, not many understand the complicated sports
recruitment process. Students who participate in LevelEdge need
file only one profile of academic, athletic and personal
information for posting on the site. They can also request that it
be sent by e-mail to specific coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The matching service will be free to students and parents. The
plan calls for financing through subscription fees from schools
that use the site for recruiting, and through advertising from
companies offering athletic goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   The site's database of potential basketball recruits will be
unveiled next month at the National Collegiate Athletic Association
during the men's and women's Final Four basketball tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited about LevelEdge because it removes economic
and geographic barriers for athletes,'' said Beth Bass, executive
director of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association. ``A student
doesn't have to pay to travel to an elite camp in order to be seen
by coaches.'' After the basketball rollout, Henderson plans to
extend LevelEdge to 20 other sports.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Henderson was one of 27 chief executives of
start-ups chosen from 350 applicants to present business
propositions to several hundred potential investors at Springboard
2000, a venture capital forum for women entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   The fair, in Silicon Valley, was championed by Kay Koplovitch,
chairwoman of the National Women's Business Council, a government
advisory panel. There, Henderson lined up her next round of
capitalization _ $10 million from a group of backers. (The fair, by
the way, proved such a success that three more are scheduled this
year, for Washington, New York and Boston.)
</P>
<P>
   Aside from building a thriving business, Henderson has three
other goals. First, she hopes not to receive any more heartbreaking
phone calls from low-income parents who have handed over big
up-front fees to freelance ``recruiters'' of dubious reputation.
Second, she eagerly awaits the first e-mail message from a student
who has found a scholarship through LevelEdge, resulting in
opportunities like the ones Henderson had.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, she hopes not to be called a ``former athlete.''
In a match last week, she scored two of the three goals for her
local indoor soccer team. &QL;

SCIENTISTS SAY ASTEROID MAY BE FRAGMENT OF A PLANET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The distant asteroid 433 Eros, which received a Valentine's Day
visit from a robot NASA spacecraft, may be the fragment of a busted
planet, scientists reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's $224.1 million Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous probe
has been transmitting photographs of the peanut-shaped Eros back to
Earth since it began to orbot the asteroid Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even at an orbital altitude of 284 miles, the spacecraft's
cameras have detected a prominent layering in the structure of the
22 mile-long, 8-mile wide asteroid, the kind of structuring
geologists believe could occur only in response to gravitational
forces much greater than those present on Eros.
</P>
<P>
   ``This layering seems to extend globally throughout the body of
the asteroid, as if this asteroid were made up of layers like a
sheet of plywood,'' said Andrew Cheng, the chief NEAR mission
scientist from Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of layering would come about if Eros was once part
of a much larger body,'' said Cheng. ``This would be an indication
that Eros is the type of asteroid that is the fragment of a
planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Most asteroids circle the sun in a beltlike formation between
the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Astronomers have long wondered
whether they are remnants left over from the formation of the solar
system 4.5 billion years ago, or chunks of a rocky planet that was
shattered by an impact with another planet. The formation of the
planets was a chaotic but little understood process.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists estimated it would take a planet at least the size of
the Earth's moon, but possibly slightly smaller, to produce the
statification they witness on Eros. On the Earth, the gravitational
forces gradually pull the heaviest minerals toward the planet's
core, leaving the less dense material in the crust, or surface
layers, of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Eros is drab, heavily cratered and 160 million miles from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eros is not a boring object, and not just a rock floating out
in space,'' said Mark Robinson, a Northwestern University
scientist. ``There is a lot of neat geology going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The NEAR probe reached Eros after a four-year journey from
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists plan to spend a year chipping away at its secrets by
gradually steering the 1,800-pound spacecraft closer and closer to
the surface. They may even attempt to land briefly for a more
intimate look.
</P>
<P>
   Other features that have quickly piqued the curiosity of
scientists are a long saddlelike depression carved into the
exterior of the asteroid, dozens of mansion-sized boulders strewn
across the surface and at least one bright prominent feature.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Eros is heavily cratered, suggesting to experts that it
is old enough to have undergone hundreds of millions of years of
bombardment by meteorites. The surface of the saddle, however, is
much less disturbed and therefore possibly much younger terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective discrepancy in the ages in the terrain of such a
small celestial body is among its most puzzling qualities. Another
is a large bright spot. The gleaming feature is high on the list of
features that will be scrutinized as NEAR begins its gradual
descent in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us have felt like kids in a candy store,'' said James
Bell, a Cornell University scientist. ``But we get to stay in this
candy store for a full year.''

 &HT;    Minorities on network TV still looking for their piece of the
pie
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Prime-time television is sickly pale these days,
no doubt about it. It's white in front of the cameras and even
whiter behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Ensemble dramas such as ``ER,'' ``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``NYPD Blue''
and ``The Practice'' are the exception. So are the ``ghettoized''
sitcoms on mini-networks WB and UPN, where a large group of black
writers work on black shows that air in separate blocks on the
schedule. And the lone network sitcom, ``The Hughleys,'' on ABC.
Not exactly a multi-cultural situation.
</P>
<P>
   Most shows on the major networks are unbelievably,
unrealistically white. It doesn't make sense for a group of young
``Friends'' in New York not to have a single African-American or
Latino pal. Then there's ``Frasier,'' which is set in Seattle, a
city with a sizable Asian population, with non-Asians as far as the
eye can see. And ``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' with no Latinos where
plenty should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV is not a mirror of society and never will be,'' says John
Ridley, an AfricanAmerican who is supervising producer and writer
on NBC's ``Third Watch.'' ``But you do need to see something that
looks like your world. When you don't, it gets to the point where
that seems OK. And it's really not.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees there's a lack of diversity in the dominant
medium of this diverse nation, but there's no agreement on what to
do about it. Should there be more minority faces on screen? Should
casting be colorblind or color conscious? Should networks focus
instead on filling writing and producing jobs to increase diversity
in a more organic manner?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, a coalition of minority leaders
hammered out agreements with the four main networks. In January,
NBC and ABC agreed to add minority writers and training programs
geared toward minorities; earlier this month, CBS and Fox agreed to
add ``vice presidents of diversity'' to their corporate management
teams.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements were hailed by some as a breakthrough. NAACP
President Kweisi Mfume called the CBS and Fox agreements ``a
constitution for real and meaningful change.'' Esteban Torres, head
of the Latino branch of the minority coalition, called the
nonbinding documents ``the Magna Charta of television.'' And Paris
Barclay, creator and co-executive producer with Steven Bochco of
the much-heralded ``City of Angels,'' a new CBS drama with a
predominantly minority cast, has said the network agreements could
``change the look and landscape of of TV very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But many minorities in the creative community have greeted the
news with a mixture of cautious optimism and skepticism. They've
heard promises before, and they've seen the diversity landscape
change in cycles. Up in the '70s, when Norman Lear's socially
conscious comedies were all the rage, down toward the end of the
decade when white-bread shows such as ``Happy Days'' and
``Charlie's Angels'' were all the rage. And then up again when
``The Cosby Show'' spawned a flurry of African-American comedies in
the '80s _ most of which were decidedly non-``Cosby'' in tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've failed to the point where you have to use these
(quota) programs, there's real trouble,'' says Ridley, whose fall
drama is chock full of diversity but was overlooked when Mfume
charged that no new series had minority characters. ``These are
very small steps _ maybe three of NBC's sophomore shows next season
will add minority writers. To me, that's tokenism. And what if it
doesn't work? That poisons the pot and makes people resentful. I'd
feel bad if I were hired just because I'm black.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridley, who landed his first writing job after doing an
internship at Fox in '94, believes training programs are a better
way to identify minority talent. He's pessimistic about the
prospect of adding one minority writer to each returning series
next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that people are paying attention to the problem,
but I don't think it'll help much,'' Ridley says. ``The issue has
come up many times over the years, but there's such a turnover in
management that the people who make these agreements are gone
before they're carried out, and the new people don't remember the
agreements were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Carter, a Southwest Texas University graduate, has had
more success in television than most minority writer-producers, but
frustration has never been too far away. He started out as an actor
on ``The White Shadow,'' a drama series about a high school
basketball team, and began learning behind-the-camera skills there.
Not long after, he directed several episodes of ``Hill Street
Blues'' before selling his own legal drama, ``Equal Justice,'' to
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Praised by critics for its smart stories, cinematic style and
multiethnic cast, ``Equal Justice,'' starring Joe Morton, should
have had an easy time but didn't. Carter says he had to fight ABC
to have Morton, who is black, as the lead. And there were
scheduling problems. It debuted midseason in 1990 and disappeared
until midseason the following year, never making a fall lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never really had a chance,'' Carter says. ``It was an
uphill battle the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   But not nearly as difficult as ``Under One Roof,'' Carter's
superb family drama starring Morton, James Earl Jones and Vanessa
Bell Calloway. The CBS series was praised by critics and even held
up in Congress as an example of strong family values. It lasted
only a month in the spring of '95.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been so much talk about how people won't
accept black dramas that I think the people at CBS had already
decided it wouldn't work,'' Carter says. ``Although I've been very
successful on TV as a director, it's been frustrating trying to get
people to stand behind the good shows I've done as a producer.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter is cautiously optimistic about the networks' diversity
agreements and agrees that the focus should shift from casting to
writing and producing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made great strides in the last 25 years in minority
casting, but we still have to work on inclusion of minorities in
the executive offices, writing staffs and those areas,'' Carter
says. ``It's difficult when you deal with creative areas to talk
about quotas. I'm not in favor of that. But when there's been a
historical exclusion of minorities in certain areas, you have to
take some kind of steps to encourage minorities to seek those
opportunities and to encourage people in power to open those
doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Latinos, the fastest-growing minority in the United States with
a population close to 30 million, have a disproportionately low
representation in television. Traditionally, diversity has been
almost exclusively represented by blacks. According to a study
released last month called ``Fall Colors: How Diverse Is the
1999-2000 TV Season's Prime Time Lineup?'' 80 percent of series
characters are white, 13 percent are black and other minorities
(Latino, Asian and American Indian) are less than 7 percent. (The
number of black characters is deceptive, since 13 percent is
actually more than the 12.2 percent of African-Americans who make
up the general population. The problem is that almost all of the
black characters on TV are congregated in the same shows, not
spread out across the prime-time landscape.)
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Latin culture is influencing music, food and just
about everything else, Latinos are practically nonexistent on
television. Since Jimmy Smits departed ``NYPD Blue'' and Benjamin
Bratt left ``Law &AMP; Order,'' Cheech Marin and Hector Elizondo are
just about the only Latino stars in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The stats tell the story: The Screen Actors Guild's membership
is only 4 percent Latino; of 839 writers of fall series, 11 are
Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos who are visible on TV tend to be stereotyped as gang
members, prostitutes, illegal aliens and drug dealers. When the
National Council of La Raza meets to bestow its media awards every
year, often there aren't enough nominations to fill the categories.
While blacks may be ghettoized on the smaller networks on certain
nights of the week, Latinos have been shipped off to their own
networks _ Univision and Telemundo, which are increasingly popular
in Latino households.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see Latinos in technical positions (on the major networks)
but certainly not in a decision-making capacity,'' says Hector
Galan, an Austin-based filmmaker whose films (``Songs of the
Homeland,'' ``Chicano! The History of the Mexican-American Civil
Rights Movement'') frequently appear on PBS. ``We've made very few
inroads. When you talk about casting, a lot of that has to do with
the people who are writing. ... There hasn't been an effort to
bring in Latinos, and it's not one of those areas that Latinos
traditionally go into as a profession. That's why we need
mentors.''
</P>
<P>
   Galan is optimistic that the networks' agreements will chip away
at the stumbling blocks and open doors for Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   So, is television's segregation the result of blatant racism or
simple ignorance on the part of the networks? Or is it the result
of viewers choosing white programs and rejecting others?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's unenlightened racial attitudes rather than
racism,'' Carter says. ``What people do in TV is hire people who
are like themselves, so if you tend not to be in the group who went
to college with them or lived in their exclusive gated communities
or played golf at their country club, you tend not to have the same
access. While I do believe the industry responds to talent, it's
not exactly a level playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter concedes he fell into the same trap when he sold ``Equal
Justice'' to ABC. The first season the show was on, he hired
writers and producers who were approved by the network and thus
considered ``safe.'' And mostly white. But when he realized that
half of the ``safe'' hires weren't all that good, he decided he
would have been better off hiring talented minorities or women.
</P>
<P>
   Of course when a show such as ``Under One Roof'' or the much
ballyhooed but low-rated ``City of Angels'' doesn't turn into a
``Cosby''-like phenomenon, the network brass says white viewers
just won't watch serious black dramas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can blame this on the audience,'' Ridley
says. ``They'll watch what's entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   But even black viewers tend to turn to black sitcoms rather than
dramas. Audience surveys after the widely praised civil rights
drama ``I'll Fly Away'' failed revealed that black viewers had no
interest in reliving racial strife. They preferred comedies.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a few mega-hits such as ``Cosby'' and
``ER,'' black and white viewers do not watch the same shows. Not
many blacks are fans of ``Friends,'' and few whites tune in for
``The Steve Harvey Show.'' That makes multicultural programming
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do like to watch themselves, but that's more true of
black people because we haven't see that much of ourselves, so
we're really hungry,'' Carter says.
</P>
<P>
   A fully integrated landscape on TV is unrealistic, but most
people agree that the networks must do better. For the diversity
agreements to have an impact, the networks need to hire more than a
couple of minority writers. They must add minorities to every level
of production and decision-making. They need to add black writers
to ``Will &AMP; Grace'' and white writers to ``Moesha.'' Otherwise,
prime time's pallor _ and segregation _ likely will continue.

   HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. _ ``In the beginning, I was neutral,''
John F. Carson said of the state's Republican primary. ``But as
I've watched and listened, I've even gotten a little excited now.
About McCain, I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson said he had come to regard Sen. John McCain as ``a
righteous individual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is what he is, it seems to me,'' Carson said.
</P>
<P>
   Carson, a retired steel executive, is one of this island's
30,000 or so permanent residents, mostly retired, mostly wealthy
and overwhelmingly Republican. Here, the rich Low Country accents
of the nearby mainland abruptly give way to voices from the
Northeast and the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Carson lived in Cleveland until he retired last year at age 62.
He has occasionally voted Democratic and said he longed for the
excitement he remembers feeling with John F. Kennedy's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was certainly open to Bush,'' he said after a tennis match
at one of the island's gated communities. ``But I found him a
little too willing to do whatever it takes to win. I thought he was
a bit slick, and I certainly didn't want that after this guy,'' he
said, referring to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain seems to stand a little taller,'' Carson said. ``I
think there is a line that he won't cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson's enthusiasm for McCain was not uniform among other
retirees interviewed here, many of whom said they would vote for
Gov. George W. Bush. But there was an across-the-board exasperation
with the rough style of the campaign. And all agreed that they had
not paid this much attention to a political race in a long while.
Many of those who said they preferred Bush also said they had been
lifelong Republicans. Many of McCain's supporters said they had
voted for Democrats at various times.
</P>
<P>
   Terry O'Donnell, who has lived for four years at Sea Pines
Plantation, as the largest development is called, said she
supported Bush as the best alternative to Steve Forbes, who
recently dropped out of the race and had been her favorite. When
her husband, Joe O'Donnell, said he liked McCain and would thus
cancel out his wife's vote, she said, ``He's really a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, a retired manufacturing executive from Baltimore,
responded: ``No, no, I'm really a Republican. Really.'' He said he
liked McCain because he would attract more people to the Republican
Party. ``I think he's flexible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell shot back, ``Of course, he's flexible. He wants to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she said of her husband, ``See. He's a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Soldan, a retired businessman and investor who had just
posted his day's golf score at the pro shop at Wexford Plantation,
one of the wealthiest enclaves, said he believed the news media had
built up McCain too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, you've got to take your hat off to him on the experience
he had as a prisoner of war,'' Soldan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's just too much,'' he added, complaining that both the
candidate and the news media had emphasized that issue too much.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Braxton, a retired military officer, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pulling for McCain all the way,'' Braxton said. ``I've
been talking him up to all my friends for a long time now. I think
he would restore some dignity there in Washington. But in the
beginning it seemed like there was no chance for him. Now, all of a
sudden, it seems he's taking off.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Turnout may be critical in S.C. dead heat race
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ The frenetic South Carolina primary campaign
focused on voter turnout Thursday as the Republican candidates
launched a final round of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush continued to criticize John McCain, saying the
Arizona senator does one thing and says another. In particular,
Bush was referring to a campaign flier that attacks Bush on Social
Security after McCain promised to run a positive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take the high horse and then claim the low road,''
Bush said in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, predicted that a win in South Carolina's
primary Saturday would propel him to the Republican nomination, the
first time he has made such a bold prognostication.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win here, I don't see how we can really be stopped,''
McCain told supporters at a pancake breakfast at VFW Post 3539 in
Spartanburg.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns acknowledged that the race is a dead heat, with
turnout likely to be the deciding factor. A lower turnout, which
probably would consist of Republican faithful, would favor Bush.
McCain is hoping for a heavy turnout of independents and Democrats,
who are allowed to vote in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   A poll directed by Clemson University political scientist David
Woodard projects a turnout of 350,000 to 370,000, which would be a
record. In 1996, when former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole beat
conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, 276,000 ballots were cast.
</P>
<P>
   If turnout stays in the 350,000 range, Woodard said, ``Bush
should be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But if turnout exceeds 400,000, with a surge of independents and
Democrats, ``Bush could be in trouble,'' Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend line is moving the right way,'' John Weaver,
McCain's political director, said about recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is redoubling his get-out-the-vote efforts, which
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A glowing letter of endorsement from the commander of the
South Carolina National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   _ A mailing outlining Bush's positions and accusing McCain of
waffling, going to 300,000 Republican, Democratic and independent
voters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two telephone calls to every voter identified as a Bush
supporter, and an additional telephone call to identified social
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ A taped telephone message from Bush that will be delivered by
automatic dial to thousands of households. A message from his wife,
Laura, will be targeted at female voters. A message from Sen. Strom
Thurmond will be dialed in to rural households.
</P>
<P>
   _ A letter of support from former presidential candidate
Elizabeth Dole is being mailed to young women. The letter
criticizes McCain's tax-cutting package. Older women are getting a
letter from Bush's mother, Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   _ A mailing to social conservativesrevives inconsistent
statements McCain has made about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain chose to ignore Bush's comments Thursday, telling an
audience in Greenville, ``I wish Governor Bush the best.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also was forced to defend himself against charges of
ethnic insensitivity relating to the use of the slur ``gooks'' to
refer to his North Vietnamese captors. An e-mail message that is
circulating among Asian-Americans includes an article from The
Nation magazine that contends McCain uses the term ``casually.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who spent 5 1/2 years in a North Vietnamese prisoner of
war camp, told reporters aboard his campaign bus that he employs it
_ and will continue to use it _ only in reference to his captors,
whom he called cruel and sadistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated the gooks and I will hate them as long as I live,'' he
said.

   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Doug Bray and Daryl Renshaw are two old
friends from nearby Bob Jones University who like a friendly
debate. So Thursday morning, as they often do, the two men shared a
pot of coffee at the International House of Pancakes and each tried
to convince the other of the error of his political thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Renshaw, 35, favors Gov. George W. Bush, while Bray, also 35,
likes Sen. John McCain. They even brought printouts of the
candidates' positions, jousting over different points. But no minds
were changed: One vote for McCain, one for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaning toward McCain,'' Bray said. ``I like the fact of
having a person in the White House who has strong leadership
qualities. What he was able to do during the war showed me has some
intestinal fortitude.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Renshaw countered, Bush is the right candidate.
Particularly, he said, since he has resisted denigrating Bob Jones
University, the conservative school that prohibits interracial
dating and refuses to allow gay alumni to return to the campus.
Renshaw said the school has been unfairly tainted in the national
media during the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I don't believe in interracial dating, I'm not a
bigot against colored people,'' Renshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a conservative state, Greenville and the surrounding
upstate region are considered ultraconservative. Bush is counting
on strong support here, and several people spoke approvingly of his
character, his anti-abortion stance and his record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in an informal survey of 34 people in Greenville, voters
were almost evenly divided, with 17 people favoring McCain, 15
favoring Bush and two undecided. Those who supported McCain cited
his character and integrity, his military record as a prisoner of
war and the belief that he would best bring change to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe in the guy,'' said Vicki Perfect, 48, a
hospital administrator. .
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat, Perfect said she is not interested in her party's
candidates and plans to delay a trip Saturday to vote for McCain in
the primary. ``I think McCain is going to stand for something.''
</P>
<P>
   A few booths away, Dean Powell, 67, the retired superintendent
of the local water system, echoed Perfect's endorsement of McCain,
particularly because of his war record. Powell said he served in
the Korean War. ``Bush is OK, but he's riding on his daddy and
mama's coattails,'' said Powell, an independent. ``I don't think he
has the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush and Barbara Bush are considered
extremely popular in South Carolina, but the family's history
seemed to be a mixed blessing for the Texas governor. Several
people cited his family as one of the reasons they found Bush
appealing. But Bill Brent, 70, a Republican retiree and McCain
supporter seemed irritated over a recent mailing he received from
Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want no dynasty going on,'' Brent said. ``I like what
McCain stands for. I want him to do something about the
lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   Several voters cited honesty and character as reasons to vote
for Bush. They also said they considered him the more conservative
candidate. ``I keep hearing John McCain caught in lies and that
bothers me,'' said Diane Jerina, 56, a Republican who was shopping
at a Publix grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   She said McCain seemed to be waffling on certain issues, noting
how he first decried the flying of the Confederate battle flag
above the state Capitol, then called it a symbol of heritage.
``He's changed his mind about the flag, and he's changed his mind
about this, that and the other.''
</P>
<P>
   A short drive away at Bob Jones University, campus officials
refused to allow a reporter to interview students and faculty until
first meeting with an administrator. James Pachter, 22, a senior
and campus security officer who stopped the reporter, did offer his
choice: Bush. Pachter said he appreciated that Bush spoke at the
school and has not criticized the university. Bush has said he
opposes any policy prohibiting interracial dating, but he has
defended his decision to speak at Bob Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more electable than Keyes,'' Pachter said, referring to
the third Republican contender, Alan Keyes. ``He's really standing
on his ground when we've become an issue,'' Pachter said. ``When he
was asked by the national media why he came here, it should be very
clear that a candidate can come to a school and speak and not
necessarily endorse every policy the school has.''

 &HT;    A low period for America's mightiest river
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The Mighty Mississippi, known for flooding entire
towns from Iowa to Louisiana, these days is a slow, slender shadow
of its former self.
</P>
<P>
   A drought that began last summer is persisting, causing the
Mississippi River to shrink to near-record low stages.
</P>
<P>
   The river is at minus 8 feet at Memphis, Tenn., about 20 feet
below normal, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. That
means it is 8 feet below a ``zero'' set point, or bench mark,
created a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The record, minus 10.7 feet, was set during the drought of 1988,
said corps spokesman Bob Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Rain this week will raise the river about 18 feet in the next 10
days, Anderson said, but then it is expected to dwindle again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a roller coaster,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The river is moving at 250,000 cubic feet of water per second.
On average in February, it moves as fast as 500,000 cubic feet per
second. During a flood, it can move 1.5 million cubic feet per
second.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the shallow depths have not caused major disruptions in
ship traffic, although there have been some delays. Along narrow
sections and at sharp bends, barges passing each other going up and
down river have to take turns, Anderson said. The Coast Guard has
been busy moving buoys to warn ships of dangerous sandbars and
sills. The corps dredges the shoals daily to prevent groundings.
</P>
<P>
   If the river gets any lower, it could impact the shipping
industry more significantly, Anderson said. Barges could be forced
to lighten their loads. In 1988, barge companies lost $1 million a
day because they could not move coal, petroleum and agricultural
products along the nation's midsection and out to the Gulf of
Mexico. The Mississippi carries 600 million tons of cargo annually.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, where the river is always deeper because
oceangoing ships sail through here, the river hasn't caused any
problems. But A.J. Gibbs, vice president of the Crescent River Port
Pilots Association, said he has never seen it so low.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs and other river pilots measure the river from sea level,
and it is less than 2 feet above sea level at downtown New Orleans.
Normally, it's about 8 feet above sea level in February.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, since the city itself is below sea level, the river
still looks high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen it stay low for this long,'' Gibbs said.
``It's either feast or famine with the Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought is affecting smaller bodies of water as well. In
Mississippi, streams and rivers are at record lows. In Louisiana,
the Atchafalaya River Basin is so low it can't support the
reproduction cycle of crawfish. The result is the worst crawfish
season anyone can remember.

   Not here.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Wyoming's elected officials are debating how large
the budget deficit could become and what services might be cut if
dramatic new measures _ including taxes _ are not passed to raise
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone say new taxes? That's almost incomprehensible to
people in Wyoming, who pay no personal income tax and, overall, a
lower percentage of their income in taxes than residents of any
other state. That's why many of them live here.
</P>
<P>
   But Wyomingites are not alone in confronting difficult choices.
While many Americans are growing wealthier and Congress debates how
much of the federal surplus should be returned to taxpayers, a
handful of states are facing choices that more commonly arise
during recessions. Their lawmakers are deciding whether to raise
taxes or cut spending because their state economies are not
diversified enough to reap the full benefits of the boom or their
tax base is too narrow.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, unstable oil prices and marginal increases in tax
revenues have left the state facing a potential deficit of $540
million for the fiscal year beginning in July, state officials
said. Mark Drennen, the state's commissioner of administration,
said that spending caps and cuts, including the dismissal of
recently hired state employees, could offset much of it.
</P>
<P>
   But a remaining deficit of $275 million, he said, would require
new revenue sources, including the possibility of a new business
tax, which is supported by Gov. Mike Foster, or a penny increase in
the 4 cent sales tax. Other possibilities are a reduction in the
state homestead exemption and an increase in the personal income
tax.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, Gov. Don Sundquist has been fighting for more than
a year for tax changes to help cover increased spending in
education and other areas. After the Legislature rejected his
proposals last year, he tried again this year with a package that
includes a flat-rate income tax. He challenged lawmakers to adopt
his plan, find other new revenue or cut spending by $342 million.
</P>
<P>
   A slow rate of economic growth in Iowa caused by depressed farm
prices, nearly full employment, a lack of new industries and an
aging population, forced Gov. Tom Vilsack to cut $30 million in
spending from the current fiscal year's budget of $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a lot of room for growth if you are not able to
add new jobs, and that affects the revenue base,'' said Randy
Bauer, the Iowa state budget director.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same factors forced the Kansas Legislature to reduce
its current budget of $4.45 billion by $65 million. ``Actual
revenue collection came up short of revenue forecasts, and that is
what caused us to go back and reduce the level of spending,'' said
Duane Goossen, the state budget director.
</P>
<P>
   No state faces a more precarious economic situation than
Wyoming, the least populated state with just 479,000 people, about
the population of Denver. It is one of only seven states with no
personal income tax and one of four with no corporate taxes, major
sources of the windfall in other states.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, almost two-thirds of Wyoming is owned by the
federal government, which means only a small part of the state
budget comes from property taxes. The largest single source of tax
revenues is from mining, as much as 60 percent in some years,
followed by revenues from sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials say Wyoming has grown too reliant on global
markets for commodities that are found in vast abundance around
Wyoming, including natural gas, coal and minerals like trona, which
is used to make soda ash, and bentonite, an absorbent clay.
</P>
<P>
   When natural gas prices are booming, for example, Wyoming's
budget is stable. The only reason the state is not facing a deficit
for the fiscal year beginning July 1 _ after deficit projections of
$127 million a year ago and $183 million six months ago _ is a
recent surge in coal prices.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of gyrations have forced state leaders to cut many
programs, like services for the elderly, from the state's $4.1
billion two-year budget. They have also prompted Gov. Jim Geringer,
a second-term Republican, to lead efforts to wean the state off the
uncertainties of volatile markets, arguing that economic growth and
full service delivery can come about only through predictable
revenue streams.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been out front on this, with the need to do something,''
said James King, a professor of political science at the University
of Wyoming in Laramie. ``He realizes you can't put a Band-Aid on
this. But whether he can truly get a long-term solution or another
Band-Aid remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his campaign, Geringer has been traveling the state,
selling ``a sense of responsibility'' to people who have grown
accustomed to low taxes. As he said in his state of the state
address this week: ``In order to create a long-term solution, we
must make some difficult choices.''
</P>
<P>
   They may be on the way.
</P>
<P>
   After state lawmakers returned on Monday for the 20-day budget
session that is held every other year, House members approved one
major revenue-raising measure for introduction as legislation, an
extension of the state's 4 percent sales tax, which was scheduled
to expire in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Votes on another proposal, a new tax on services, were held back
until Friday to give lawmakers time to generate more support. But a
raft of other proposals failed, including ones that would have a
created a personal income tax and a tax on electricity production
and separate measures that would have increased taxes on fuel,
cigarettes and property.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in tax-loathing Wyoming, even one new tax is dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an optimist,'' said House Speaker Eli Bebout. ``I think
we're on the path toward long-term solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Geringer said the Legislature was ``a little bit gun shy'' about
adopting long-range solutions. But he held out hope that more
measures would be approved, saying it was just a matter of finding
mutually agreeable approaches.
</P>
<P>
   But even new taxes might not be enough to keep Wyoming stable in
the long run. Other than scenic beauty, recreation and the tax
base, Wyoming has few advantages for prospective residents and
businesses over neighboring western states. Its population has
dropped for four consecutive years though mid-1999. Only one
airport in the state, Jackson's, accommodates commercial jets. A
teacher shortage is looming in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a new state agency, the Wyoming Business Council,
was formed to attract businesses, but some lawmakers are trying to
eliminate its $21 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie A. Ball, a council board member, says that would be a
mistake. A former executive with Macy's who moved from New York to
Cheyenne six years ago to become chief executive of a western wear
company, Ball said the council has already landed eight new
companies, bringing in 800 new jobs, and has prospects for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of obstacles here, but the state is starting
to move a little bit,'' Ball said. ``For the first time in a long
time, all the economic categories are moving. I think the state has
a fairly positive future.''

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said
Wednesday that the powerhouse economy shows few signs of slowing
despite four interest rate increases over the last eight months,
and he warned in unusually direct terms that the central bank would
probably raise rates further to avert a buildup of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to the House Banking Committee, Greenspan was also
blunter than normal in suggesting that one of his primary targets
in raising interest rates was the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time he set out what amounted to a speed limit for
Wall Street, saying that wringing the risk of inflation out of the
economy would require that stock and other asset prices rise no
faster than household incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, household wealth _ a broad measure that captures the
persistent gains in most stock prices _ grew twice as fast as
income, according to figures often employed by economists at the
Fed to gauge the effects of the market on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan did not specify what his arcane equation meant for
popular measures of stock prices like the Dow Jones industrial
average or the Nasdaq, although he emphasized that it would ``not
necessarily imply a decline in asset values.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors in blue chip stocks seemed to mildly heed the Fed
chairman's warning, sending the Dow industrial average down 46.84
points, to 10,514.57. But investors in technology stocks _ as they
have done repeatedly over the last few years _ thumbed their noses
at Greenspan by driving the Nasdaq index up 121.27 points, to
4,548.92, another record.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed next meets to consider monetary policy on March 21, and
economists said the tone of Greenspan's testimony Thursday all but
ensured that the central bank would act then to raise its benchmark
federal funds target rate by another quarter of a point, to 6
percent. They said additional increases could follow through the
spring and into summer if the economy did not slow.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the good news the nation has enjoyed now for years,
Greenspan said the current combination of strong growth, low
inflation, declining unemployment and improving efficiency among
businesses and workers was unprecedented in the half century he has
spent monitoring the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But he stressed that the good times could fall victim to
gradually mounting inflation pressures if the Fed did not act to
take some steam out of the expansion, which this month became the
longest on record at eight years and 11 months. The previous record
period of economic growth without a recession lasted through much
of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance that touched on a wide array of topics,
Greenspan brushed aside concerns that the recent turmoil in the
bond market was making the Fed's job harder. Yes, he acknowledged,
investors had driven down the interest rate on 30-year government
bonds at a time when the Fed was trying to use higher interest
rates to slow the economy. But the important thing, he said, was
that rates paid by private sector borrowers, especially
corporations, had risen substantially. Mortgage rates, too, while
not yet significantly slowing home building, have now reached a 3
1/2 year high.
</P>
<P>
   But in the formal report on monetary policy that he submitted to
Congress Thursday, Greenspan acknowledged that aspects of the
economy were making the central bank's job more complicated. In
particular, the report said, the rise in the growth rate of
productivity _ the amount that each worker produces per hour _ made
the economy so resilient that the scale of interest rate increases
needed to bring inflationary growth under control ``may have
increased substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan reiterated his position that the federal budget
surplus should be used to reduce the national debt rather than for
tax cuts or new spending. And he said he was somewhat worried by
the recent sharp rise in oil prices, but advised against selling
the government's oil reserves to try to bring the price down,
saying such a move would be ineffectual.
</P>
<P>
   But his focus was on the risk that the economy was simply too
strong for its own good.
</P>
<P>
   The strains on the economy might soon become evident in the
labor market, he said, where a rapidly declining pool of jobless
workers could force employers to begin raising wages at a pace that
could ignite a widespread and destabilizing rise in prices. The
nation is also bumping up against the limit of how much it can
afford to import from other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he traced the underlying problem to the stock market.
Buoyant stock prices, he said, were fueling consumer spending and
business investment to such a degree that overall demand in the
economy was outstripping supply. The only way to resolve that
fundamental imbalance, he said, was to sharply curtail the
relentless rise in equity prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little evidence that the American economy, which grew
more than 4 percent in 1999 and surged forward at an even faster
pace in the second half of the year, is slowing appreciably,''
Greenspan said at the beginning of his twice-a-year testimony to
Congress on monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the very factors underpinning the nation's remarkable
economic performance _ falling joblessness, accelerating
productivity, an improved outlook for corporate earnings _ ``are
also engendering a set of imbalances that, unless contained,
threaten our continuing prosperity,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures on the economy have been eased so far by a surge
in imports, which have made up for the inability of domestic
producers to keep up with demand, and by the willingness of people
who had not previously been in the labor force to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   But those ``safety valves,'' he said, could not contain
inflationary pressures forever, especially since the rate increases
so far have done little to rein in growth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's policy-setting federal Open Market Committee ``will
have to stay alert for signs that real interest rates have not yet
risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line with that of
potential supply, even should the acceleration of productivity
continue,'' Greenspan said. ``Achieving that alignment seems more
pressing today than it did earlier, before the effects of
imbalances began to cumulate, lessening the depths of our various
buffers against inflationary pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of rebalancing the economy, he said, would be limiting or
ending the rise in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable run-up in stock prices over much of the last
decade has been tempered or even reversed by some measures over the
last six months, though it remains almost as breathtaking as ever
by others. Greenspan made clear that he was not predicting a
downturn in the market, emphasizing only that it would be difficult
to achieve the kind of moderation he wants to see in the economy
without a leveling off of stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not necessarily imply a decline in asset values,
although that, of course, can happen at any time for a number of
reasons,'' he said, ``but rather that these values will increase no
faster than household incomes.''
</P>
<P>
   G. David Orr, an economist at First Union Securities, said, ``If
that is not targeting the stock market, what is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has long worried aloud about what economists call the
``wealth effect,'' the idea that rising stock prices translate into
higher spending levels by consumers. In his testimony Thursday, he
said historical evidence suggests that 3 to 4 cents of every dollar
in additional stock market wealth is reflected in increased
purchases by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman said he tracked the wealth effect by looking at
the ratio of household net worth, or wealth, to income. According
to data collected by the Fed, net worth was 4.88 times higher than
disposable income in 1988. By 1998, net worth was 5.95 times higher
than income.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has not yet released figures for 1999. But economists
said wealth last year grew at about 11.3 percent, while income grew
about 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed's interest rate increases so far do not appear to
have slowed demand, the inflation that Greenspan fears has also
been a no-show. Just Thursday, the government's report on prices at
the producer level showed that inflation remained tame.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Fed's own forecast, submitted to Congress Thursday
as part of the monetary policy report, concludes that consumer
prices this year will rise between 1.75 percent and 2 percent,
compared with 2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The report also forecasts that the economy will expand between
3.5 percent and 3.75 percent, down from 4.2 percent last year. That
implies that the Fed now believes that the economy has the capacity
to grow at better than 3.5 percent a year over the long run without
producing inflationary pressures, well above what economists
believed possible not that long ago.

 &HT;    Water usage plan may cause serious drought in Georgia, official
says
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The current plan to settle the bitter water war with
Alabama and Florida would leave metro Atlanta in ``perpetual
drought'' and lower Lake Lanier to ``dangerous levels,'' the head
of the metro area's planning agency warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the negotiations have the potential to create
great hardship for all of Metropolitan Atlanta, indeed all of North
Georgia,'' departing Atlanta Regional Commission Director Harry
West said in a letter to Georgia's negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking his public silence since negotiations began in the
10-year water feud, West warned that plans now under consideration
would be disastrous for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He said his staff's analysis showed current proposals to divide
up the waters of the Chattahoochee, the Flint and other rivers
flowing through the region would lower Lake Lanier to unacceptable
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perpetual drought will become the normal operating procedure
for Metropolitan Atlanta,'' West said in the letter last week to
chief negotiator Bob Kerr and to Harold Reheis, head of the state
Environmental Protection Division. ``Any agreement that does not
allow for the sound management of Lake Lanier will be bad for
Georgia and disastrous for Metropolitan Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr said Thursday he and fellow negotiators are studying West's
concerns. ``We will give full consideration to his comments,'' said
Kerr, who added that discussing the letter further could jeopardize
negotiations with the other states.
</P>
<P>
   West could not be reached for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The states are trying to work out water allocation formulas in
two negotiations. Georgia, Florida and Alabama are fighting over
the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee and Flint rivers, the so-called ACF
basin. In a separate negotiation, Georgia and Alabama are
squabbling over the Alabama, Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, the ACT
basin.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia wants to be assured of enough water from the river
basins to fuel projected growth in metro Atlanta and North Georgia
through the next 30 to 50 years. Alabama wants adequate water to
support its own growth, and Florida wants to be assured of enough
water coming down the Apalachicola to protect its thriving oyster
industry in Apalachicola Bay at the tail end of the ACF basin.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, West said Georgia could not deliver to Florida
the amount of water called for under current proposals without
jeopardizing Lake Lanier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be mathematically impossible to manage the
Chattahoochee (through dams now on the river) to guarantee these
flows,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   The states have until May 1 to reach water allocation agreements
for both basins. If there is no settlement, the water war most
likely will be tossed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it could
take years and millions of dollars to settle. The feud has cost
taxpayers more than $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman on Thursday hinted the squabble may
very well end up before the nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Alabama chief negotiator Jim Campbell, Siegelman
said Georgia ``has been absolutely unwilling to meet us halfway''
in agreeing on an allocation formula for the ACT. ``Alabama has
been fair and reasonable in this process, but if Georgia is
unwilling to consider our needs, we will see them in court,''
Siegelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials have expressed similar sentiments over the
ACF.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, ACT talks in Montgomery between Alabama and Georgia
negotiators verged on breaking down.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell characterized Georgia's latest proposal as ``We'll take
all the water we want, and if there's anything left, you can have
it.''

<P>
   CHEYENNE, Wyo. _ The nation's record economic expansion has left
most states so flush with tax revenues that lawmakers argue over
how to spend a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Not here.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Wyoming's elected officials are debating how large
the budget deficit could become and what services might be cut if
dramatic new measures _ including taxes _ are not passed to raise
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone say new taxes? That's almost incomprehensible to
people in Wyoming, who pay no personal income tax and, overall, a
lower percentage of their income in taxes than residents of any
other state. That's why many of them live here.
</P>
<P>
   But Wyomingites are not alone in confronting difficult choices.
While many Americans are growing wealthier and Congress debates how
much of the federal surplus should be returned to taxpayers, a
handful of states are facing choices that more commonly arise
during recessions. Their lawmakers are deciding whether to raise
taxes or cut spending because their state economies are not
diversified enough to reap the full benefits of the boom or their
tax base is too narrow.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, unstable oil prices and marginal increases in tax
revenues have left the state facing a potential deficit of $540
million for the fiscal year beginning in July, state officials
said. Mark Drennen, the state's commissioner of administration,
said that spending caps and cuts, including the dismissal of
recently hired state employees, could offset much of it.
</P>
<P>
   But a remaining deficit of $275 million, he said, would require
new revenue sources, including the possibility of a new business
tax, which is supported by Gov. Mike Foster, or a penny increase in
the 4 cent sales tax. Other possibilities are a reduction in the
state homestead exemption and an increase in the personal income
tax.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, Gov. Don Sundquist has been fighting for more than
a year for tax changes to help cover increased spending in
education and other areas. After the Legislature rejected his
proposals last year, he tried again this year with a package that
includes a flat-rate income tax. He challenged lawmakers to adopt
his plan, find other new revenue or cut spending by $342 million.
</P>
<P>
   A slow rate of economic growth in Iowa caused by depressed farm
prices, nearly full employment, a lack of new industries and an
aging population, forced Gov. Tom Vilsack to cut $30 million in
spending from the current fiscal year's budget of $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a lot of room for growth if you are not able to
add new jobs, and that affects the revenue base,'' said Randy
Bauer, the Iowa state budget director.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same factors forced the Kansas Legislature to reduce
its current budget of $4.45 billion by $65 million. ``Actual
revenue collection came up short of revenue forecasts, and that is
what caused us to go back and reduce the level of spending,'' said
Duane Goossen, the state budget director.
</P>
<P>
   No state faces a more precarious economic situation than
Wyoming, the least populated state with just 479,000 people, about
the population of Denver. It is one of only seven states with no
personal income tax and one of four with no corporate taxes, major
sources of the windfall in other states.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, almost two-thirds of Wyoming is owned by the
federal government, which means only a small part of the state
budget comes from property taxes. The largest single source of tax
revenues is from mining, as much as 60 percent in some years,
followed by revenues from sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials say Wyoming has grown too reliant on global
markets for commodities that are found in vast abundance around
Wyoming, including natural gas, coal and minerals like trona, which
is used to make soda ash, and bentonite, an absorbent clay.
</P>
<P>
   When natural gas prices are booming, for example, Wyoming's
budget is stable. The only reason the state is not facing a deficit
for the fiscal year beginning July 1 _ after deficit projections of
$127 million a year ago and $183 million six months ago _ is a
recent surge in coal prices.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of gyrations have forced state leaders to cut many
programs, like services for the elderly, from the state's $4.1
billion two-year budget. They have also prompted Gov. Jim Geringer,
a second-term Republican, to lead efforts to wean the state off the
uncertainties of volatile markets, arguing that economic growth and
full service delivery can come about only through predictable
revenue streams.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been out front on this, with the need to do something,''
said James King, a professor of political science at the University
of Wyoming in Laramie. ``He realizes you can't put a Band-Aid on
this. But whether he can truly get a long-term solution or another
Band-Aid remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his campaign, Geringer has been traveling the state,
selling ``a sense of responsibility'' to people who have grown
accustomed to low taxes. As he said in his state of the state
address this week: ``In order to create a long-term solution, we
must make some difficult choices.''
</P>
<P>
   They may be on the way.
</P>
<P>
   After state lawmakers returned on Monday for the 20-day budget
session that is held every other year, House members approved one
major revenue-raising measure for introduction as legislation, an
extension of the state's 4 percent sales tax, which was scheduled
to expire in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Votes on another proposal, a new tax on services, were held back
until Friday to give lawmakers time to generate more support. But a
raft of other proposals failed, including ones that would have a
created a personal income tax and a tax on electricity production
and separate measures that would have increased taxes on fuel,
cigarettes and property.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in tax-loathing Wyoming, even one new tax is dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an optimist,'' said House Speaker Eli Bebout. ``I think
we're on the path toward long-term solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Geringer said the Legislature was ``a little bit gun shy'' about
adopting long-range solutions. But he held out hope that more
measures would be approved, saying it was just a matter of finding
mutually agreeable approaches.
</P>
<P>
   But even new taxes might not be enough to keep Wyoming stable in
the long run. Other than scenic beauty, recreation and the tax
base, Wyoming has few advantages for prospective residents and
businesses over neighboring western states. Its population has
dropped for four consecutive years though mid-1999. Only one
airport in the state, Jackson's, accommodates commercial jets. A
teacher shortage is looming in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a new state agency, the Wyoming Business Council,
was formed to attract businesses, but some lawmakers are trying to
eliminate its $21 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie A. Ball, a council board member, says that would be a
mistake. A former executive with Macy's who moved from New York to
Cheyenne six years ago to become chief executive of a western wear
company, Ball said the council has already landed eight new
companies, bringing in 800 new jobs, and has prospects for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of obstacles here, but the state is starting
to move a little bit,'' Ball said. ``For the first time in a long
time, all the economic categories are moving. I think the state has
a fairly positive future.''

HEAD OF KOMERCNI BANKA RESIGNS DURING FRAUD INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LADKA BAUEROVA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The chairman of the Czech Republic's
Komercni Banka has resigned during an investigation into suspected
fraud at the ailing state-controlled bank, the largest in Central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Czech government called the departure of Jan
Kollert, 50, an important step in preparing the bank for
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Kollert, who stepped down Wednesday after less than two years on
the job, is the first high-ranking executive of the bank to leave
since financial irregularities were uncovered there late last year.
A complete replacement of the bank's management is planned by the
government, said Prime Minister Pavel Mertlik.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is currently saddled with $1.77 billion of
nonperforming loans, about 30 percent of its loan portfolio. The
government is hoping to clean up the bank's financial problems and
sell it by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government welcomes Kollert's resignation,'' Mertlik said.
``It was a logical step in light of all the problems that have
surfaced recently.''
</P>
<P>
   He announced that the state would assume the bulk of the bank's
nonperforming loans by the end of April. The cost of the portfolio
cleanup will be borne by Czech taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heavy losses and a problem-riddled loan portfolio,
Komercni represents an attractive investment opportunity to foreign
financial institutions, banking analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine big European banks, and maybe even overseas
banks, being interested in Komercni,'' said Martin Vojta, a
financial analyst with the Patria Finance brokerage firm in Prague.
``It could be especially attractive to large German banks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the bank's management shake-up was likely to have a
positive effect on its share value. Komercni shares already have
risen more than 70 percent this year in anticipation of a
government bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Kollert's leadership of the bank was called into question in
December when Komercni's auditor, Deloitte &AMP; Touche, pointed out
huge discrepancies in the bank's books.
</P>
<P>
   The audit indicated that Komercni had fallen victim to a
complicated fraudulent scheme involving an Austrian commodity
trading company, BCL Trading; the scheme cost the bank $22 million.
The case is currently under police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Komercni has accumulated some of its bad loans in the last two
years, a period that included a recession in which many local
companies fell behind with loan repayments. But a greater portion
of its bad portfolio dates back to the early and mid-1990s, when
the bank was lending heavily to recently privatized companies and
fledgling private businesses that emerged after the fall of
Communism.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Czech government has rid Komercni of
nonperforming loans worth $640 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mertlik said in a radio interview Thursday that he expected the
government to get more than $1.1 billion from the sale of Komercni
Banka.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised that the planned April bailout would be the
last before its privatization. ``Unless something goes terribly
wrong again, this is the last time we will assist Komercni Banka
with its problems,'' he said.

 &HT;    NRA backs Barnes' gun control plan
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes unveiled a gun control
proposal Thursday that immediately drew praise from an unlikely
source: the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes asked the General Assembly to increase penalties for
adults furnishing firearms to minors and for carrying guns to
schools. He also wants to make it a crime for felons to even
attempt buying a gun _ for what he described, half-jokingly, as
``criminal stupidity.'' Current law prevents them only from
completing the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill helps keep guns out of the hands of convicted
criminals and away from our children and schools,'' Barnes said at
a news conference. ``And those are two of the most important things
we can do in law enforcement today.''
</P>
<P>
   But the governor's plan may have more symbolic value than actual
effect on gun availability and violence, a political analyst
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a safe way to crack down some on gun abuse,'' said
Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of
Georgia. ``But it doesn't plow any new ground. It certainly isn't
going to reduce the availability of guns.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bullock added: ``It is a step against gun abuse. Many a
person who had been supported by the NRA would not even do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has enjoyed support from the NRA, a powerful force in
Georgia _ and national _ politics. The organization, which counts
90,000 members in the state, endorsed him in the 1998 governor's
race. It donated $5,000 to his campaign that year and gave another
$1,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes returned the favor shortly after he took office. One of
the first major bills he signed last year was an NRA-backed measure
that sought to prevent Georgia cities from suing firearms
manufacturers to recover costs of dealing with gun violence. A
lawsuit is pending over whether the measure blocks a suit the city
of Atlanta had already filed.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Barnes has not taken a position on a bill that would
make it a misdemeanor for adults to leave a handgun within easy
reach of a child younger than 18. The NRA opposes the measure,
which it describes as ``feel-good legislation'' that would
``stigmatize'' gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   But the NRA offered unqualified support for Barnes' bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is putting resources where they belong in
fighting crime _ which is on armed criminals and criminals who are
seeking to illegally arm themselves,'' said Randy Kozuch, the NRA's
director of state and local affairs. ``We commend the governor for
showing the courage to face the heart of the problem, which is
armed criminals in our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said that if the bill had already been law, charges could
have been filed against the 9,000 convicted felons who have tried
to buy firearms from Georgia gun dealers since 1996. All were
turned away after background checks. But the only possible
sanctions they could face would be federal perjury charges if they
lied on a gun purchase application.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they go out and try again,'' Barnes said, ``and they find a
seller that's willing to sell to them anyway. Get a gun on the
street. That's the loophole we're trying to close.''
</P>
<P>
   Felons who seek to buy firearms could be sentenced to one to
five years in prison. No other state punishes felons for simply
trying to buy a gun, Barnes' aides and NRA spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   They also said the bill would impose the nation's toughest
penalty for possessing a firearm at or near a school or on a school
bus. The penalty would double to 10 years in prison and would
continue to have a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to say to every child _ and to every adult who would
give a child a handgun _ that we as a society will not tolerate
it,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also increase the minimum sentence for providing
a handgun to a minor to five years, up from one year. A second
conviction for anyone under 18 possessing a handgun would be a
felony, punishable by at least three years in prison and a $5,000
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the bill would increase penalties for convicted felons
who receive, possess or transport firearms; for carrying a
concealed deadly weapon; and for possessing a sawed-off shotgun,
machine gun or silencer.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he did not consult with the NRA before drafting the
bill. NRA's Kozuch said his organization provided no suggestions on
the measure's content.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed us the package,'' Kozuch said, ``and we expressed
our support for it.''

EMPLOYERS SAY AVERAGE LONGSHOREMAN MAKES $100,000 A YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Want to make $100,000 a year?
</P>
<P>
   Write software.
</P>
<P>
   Be a law partner.
</P>
<P>
   Or get a job as a longshoreman.
</P>
<P>
   In each case you will have to work more than 40 hours a week.
But to stack shipping containers, you won't have to go to grad
school.
</P>
<P>
   The average West Coast longshoreman, journeyman class, working
full-time or better, earned $101,500 last year. So says the Pacific
Maritime Association, the San Francisco-based association of
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike pay for seamen, carpenters or even aerospace machinists,
the longshore workers' pay compares well with salaries for
white-collar professionals.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't count their stock options, its even above the
much touted pay of computer engineers. The state says computer
engineers average $63,350, plus options. Of course, their options
can be substantial. The American Electronics Association says
Washington software employees, for example, average $158,000
including options.
</P>
<P>
   Longshore workers have been highly paid for years. In the 1960s,
Harry Bridges of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union
negotiated a deal that allowed shipowners to containerize. In
return, he won higher pay. Bridges, a scrappy left-winger who
professed little use for bosses, had won his members great
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just sharp negotiating. It was bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the strongest trade unions in the United
States,'' said David Olson, a University of Washington professor of
political science who has studied waterfront workers. ``It battled
over decades to achieve the status it has, and those battles are
seared in the memories of all members of this union. It shows
extraordinary solidarity, and extraordinary strategic abilities at
its leaderhip level. And when they sit down at the bargaining
table, they are tough as nails.''
</P>
<P>
   The longshoremen have the power to shut down the docks. One
day's delay can cost ship owners thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employer is not willing to take a strike,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   The ILWU headquarters in San Francisco declined to comment on
the $101,000 figure. Steve Perkins, business agent for ILWU Local
19 in Seattle, was skeptical of it. ``In this area, that is
absolutely wrong. It certainly doesn't apply in Seattle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I wish I made that much money. I've been here 33
years. I've never made that.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Johnson, manager in Seattle for the owners' organization,
agreed that a higher proportion of $100,000-plus workers is in Los
Angeles-Long Beach, the ports offering the steadiest work.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Robert Dockendorff, the maritime association's vice
president for research, there are longshoremen pulling down more
than $100,000 in Seattle and Tacoma. Some operate gantry cranes, a
delicate job in whcih mistakes can be fatal; others do simpler jobs
running lifting vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   As for the derisive laughs PMA gets for its survey, he said,
``We do the payrolls. That's where we get the figures.''
</P>
<P>
   His $101,500 figure is for class ``A'' longshoremen. It does not
include less experienced class ``B'' workers or casual workers, who
earn less _ nor clerks or foremen, who earn more.
</P>
<P>
   His $101,500 figure includes straight time, overtime, vacation
and holidays but not pension contributions, medical and other
benefits. These added $32,000 per worker under the old contract,
according to the employers' survey. (A new 3-year contract was
reached last summer.)
</P>
<P>
   The $101,500 average is only for those with at least 2,000 hours
of paid time. Some 55 percent of the journeymen longshoremen worked
that much time; 45 percent didn't. Many stop after 1,300 hours, the
minimum to qualify for a year's work under the pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   The average income for all West Coast journeymen longshore
workers, including part-timers, was $79,767.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state has different figures. Unlike the employers'
averages, the state's are medians (half of examples are above, half
below). That lowers them. They are for 1998, not 1999, which also
lowers them.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the state says:
</P>
<P>
   Longshore equipment operator, $71,420.
</P>
<P>
   Stevedore, $67,600.
</P>
<P>
   Though lower, these are still the sort of pay reported for
pharmacists and chemical engineers and nearly double the pay of a
carpenter or able seaman.
</P>
<P>
   The state's figures do not include overtime, which is how the
longshore worker who gets $100,000 does it. His base rate is
$26.68, which works out to $55,000 per year. But in addition to
overtime, other rules increase pay. If a longshore worker operates
a machine, his rate is $29.35 to $34.68; on overtime, $44.03 to
$52.02.
</P>
<P>
   It's standard practice for some workers to book nine or 10 hours
per day. Longshore clerk William Wallace, who has worked on the
waterfront for 35 years, puts in 10-hour days. Still, he laughed at
the the employers' wage survey. ``Last year was the first I made
more than $100,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He radioed to the driver of a top picker. ``How many hours did
you have last year?''
</P>
<P>
   ``2,236,'' the driver replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was your gross?''
</P>
<P>
   A pause. ``Just over 85.''
</P>
<P>
   That's $38 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace explained that a reporter was asking about the $100,000
worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to scramble pretty hard for that,'' the driver
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some do. Sometimes workers volunteer to do two shifts, called a
double out. ``We have guys here who make 10 shifts a week,''
Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   The employers' statistics show that 13 percent of longshoremen
clocked at least 2,800 hours last year.
</P>
<P>
   Do they work hard? That's more than four months of overtime.

   MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. _ The white-collar professionals at a
mid-week buffet supper at East Cooper Baptist Church, a big
congregation in this growing, affluent suburb of Charleston, take
their politics seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of those interviewed said they had tuned into the
three Republican candidates' debate on CNN on Tuesday night, and
several said they had attended rallies to hear the candidates. But
while they share conservative beliefs, there is little consensus on
a favorite Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Among these white Southern Baptists in the state's Low Country,
Alan Keyes, a black Roman Catholic, has won surprising support.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes has ``got a terrific Christian worldview of the integrity
and value of life,'' said Dennis Allen, 43, a former Air Force
fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bret Lott, 41, a novelist, said he would vote for
Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to know he's not going to win,'' Lott said, though he
added, ``His convictions are not swayed by the demographics he's
speaking to. And that means he's a man of character, a man of
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Most East Cooper Baptist members, however, lean toward either
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas or Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mosteller, 43, who manages a tour boat company, backs
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has a compelling persona, he is a leader,'' said
Mosteller, whose wife, Cyndi, is vice chairman of the Charleston
County Republican Party and serves on McCain's national steering
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mosteller, 43, took McCain, an Episcopalian, to visit East
Cooper Baptist last August. Asked about the differing opinions in
the church, she said in an interview, ``We don't have a bloc vote.
And I think that has happened to the Christian community in the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   People are assessing the candidates on their own, Mosteller
said, rather than following recommendations of conservative
organizations like the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Sharon Mills said they were leaning toward McCain.
Dr. Mills, 43, said he liked the senator's talk of using the budget
surplus to reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Millses said they would be content if Bush won the
Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they both are very honest candidates,'' Dr. Mills
said.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Bates, 43, a real estate developer, said he would vote for
Bush, partly because of the governor's emphasis on education and
tax-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Reg Christopher, 34, an engineer, also cited Bush's tax plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an entrepreneur, a small-business owner, so tax reductions
in any form I'm for,'' said Christopher, who said he also liked
Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptists are the largest single religious group in
South Carolina, nearly 750,000 people spread among more than 1,900
congregations. They form a natural constituency for Bush, a United
Methodist who, with his story of a personal religious conversion,
speaks a language familiar to evangelical Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican presidential primaries in the South in 1988,
surveys showed that Southern Baptist ministers voted by a 2-to-1
margin for Bush's father, Vice President George Bush, said James L.
Guth, a professor of political science at Furman University in
Greenville. S.C. And this year, Guth said, the younger Bush may do
well in South Carolina's northern counties, where Southern Baptists
are especially numerous.
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy T. Ammerman, a sociologist of religion at Hartford
Seminary in Hartford, Conn., said McCain's image as a crusading
reformer, opposed to big money in politics, would also appeal to
Southern evangelicals, who traditionally see themselves as
outsiders critical of the secular establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Brunderman, 40, a teacher at East Cooper Baptist's school,
said she leaned toward McCain. Brunderman, whose husband is an Air
Force lieutenant colonel, said she liked McCain's knowledge of
military matters and was convinced that he was solidly against
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really is a conservative,'' Brunderman said.

SOUTH TEXAS OFFICIALS SAY MEXICO WITHHOLDING IRRIGATION WATER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Joe Joe White is cq) 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   McALLEN, Texas _ Mexico is withholding billions of gallons of
irrigation water from the Rio Grande, pushing many South Texas
farmers to the brink of insolvency, Valley water officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the Rio Grande Regional Water Planning Group
Thursday, angry farmers and some board members called for trade
sanctions and other reprisals against Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And while Glenn Jarvis, the McAllen attorney who chairs the
water planning group, said Mexican officials have indicated they
will release more water in the near future, it was clear many
farmers and other water officials are not willing to wait any
longer. Mexico has been withholding water since 1992, they charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to go ahead and address the problem right now,
instead of putting it off,'' insisted Jimmy Steidinger, a Hidalgo
County citrus producer. ``We've only got one more watering (left)
on some of these citrus groves, it's going to be a total disaster
to the Valley. A lot of these water districts are out of water,
almost. They need to go ahead and talk to the head people in
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, the United States and Mexico signed a treaty to build
two dams on the Rio Grande, and Mexico agreed to release an average
of a hundred-billion gallons of water into the Rio Grande a year.
The only exceptions allowed were in cases of ``extraordinary
drought'' or accidents in Mexico's hydraulic system.
</P>
<P>
   But at Thursday's meeting, Austin consultant R.J. Brandes said
records obtained from the International Boundary and Water
Commission show that from 1992 to 1997, Mexico had plenty of
rainfall and river inflows to the Rio Grande watershed to allow it
meet the treaty requirements, but the country nevertheless fell far
short of the quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reservoirs on the Mexican tributaries are storing more
water, there is more demand for water in Mexico and more water is
being used,'' Brandes said. ``It simply isn't making it to the Rio
Grande.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Joe White, manager of the Valley's largest irrigation
district, said the water shortage in the two Rio Grande reservoirs
cost growers in three Valley counties $150 million in reduced crop
harvests during 1998. The figure climbs as high as $400 million
when lost salaries and other expenses and added to the equation,
White said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Hill, manager of the Bayview Irrigation District No. 11
in Los Fresnos, accused Mexico of withholding the water to serve
its own growing agri-businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some large American companies that have gone into
and are operating on the Conchos (the largest tributary to the Rio
Grande) and basically those are large operations that need the
water,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill claims to have seen documentation indicating Mexico's 1997
harvest was the largest in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they're in there producing as much as they can,
like we do in the Valley, but they're using our water, at our
expense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McAllen's public utilities system manager, Bart Hines, suggested
the United States retaliate by withholding some of the 32 billion
gallons of water released to Mexico each year from the Colorado
River. IBWC engineers said that is not possible.
</P>
<P>
   A number of officials accused the international water commission
of bungling talks with the Mexicans. They called on the Texas and
U.S. governments to get involved in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are in the year 2000 and nothing has been done,'' said
James Matz, a Cameron County commissioner. ``We're at the beginning
of another planting season, the agricultural community is just
about ready to go bankrupt. We need help now.''
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Jarvis is optimistic the water dispute will be worked
out later this month during a Monterrey, Mexico, meeting of the
IBWC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is something that will be resolved, it will be a
matter of time possibly,'' Jarvis said. ``I think ultimately Mexico
will release some water.''

<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ With only two days to go before a Republican
primary that seems too close to call, Gov. George W. Bush and
Senator John McCain raced across South Carolina on Thursday, with
Bush continuing a relentless attack on his opponent and McCain
making a broad appeal for the votes of Democrats, independents and
Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   The day offered a vivid reflection of the diverging strategies
of the main two Republican contenders, both of whom recognize that
turnout will be critical in Saturday's primary and that the outcome
could play a pivotal role in deciding the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   At several events on Thursday, Bush made a direct appeal to
conservatives, saying that McCain was continuing to run a negative
campaign and that prominent Democrats were encouraging their party
members _ who are allowed to vote in the Republican primary _ to
support McCain because he would be an easier opponent for a
Democratic nominee to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are supporting me in big numbers in South
Carolina,'' Bush told reporters. ``There's a real intensity about
it. I do hear some concern amongst Republicans that it's going to
be the Democrats who determine the outcome of the election here,
and they want to make sure that doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain seemed to be trying to sail above the brittle fight here,
barely mentioning his opponent by name.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign released a new advertisement that compares him to
Ronald Reagan, and McCain, ever mindful of the crossover vote that
helped produced his stunning victory in New Hampshire two weeks
ago, talked expansively about his desire for a Republican Party
that could attract independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Republican Party to some degree has lost its way,'' he said
to a veterans rally. ``I want it to be a reform party; I want it to
be an inclusive party. It's not about being a Republican and
Democrat. What it's really being about is the core principles and
ideals about less government, lower taxes and a strong national
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was also bombarding the state's talk radio stations
with calls. In the morning and afternoon, McCain sat in the back of
his bus telephoning drive-time hosts, while Gary Bauer, a former
presidential rival who appealed to Christian conservatives, made
his own cell-phone calls to different stations from the front of
the bus.
</P>
<P>
   In a new touch, the McCain bus now has its Web address, which is
McCain2000.com, emblazoned on its roof, a move the campaign made
after the Today Show used helicopters to help in its interview of
McCain from the bus.
</P>
<P>
   McCain tangled with Bush over a flier that also became an issue
in their debate earlier in the week. At the beginning of a news
conference in Florence on Thursday morning, without any prompting,
Bush charged that McCain was still distributing the flier, which
contradicted both the senator's positive-campaign pledge last week
and his statements during a debate on Tuesday that his campaign was
not disseminating the document.
</P>
<P>
   The flier asserted that Bush wanted to nationalize education and
that his tax cut plan would squander the federal surplus so that
there was not ``one red cent'' left to shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing factual about this,'' Bush complained. ``The
senator has got to understand that he can't have it both ways. He
can't take the high horse and then claim the low road.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's education plan calls for more intensive federal
monitoring of schools and programs that get federal money, but he
talks often about keeping public education a local prerogative. And
the surplus issue is a matter of much debate, based on what pools
of money are being considered.
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded that the flier did not constitute a negative
attack on Bush because it told the truth. ``The flier is
accurate,'' he said. ``It's totally accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   He also tried to explain why he had disavowed involvement with
the flier during the debate. ``I obviously mistakenly took his word
for it that it was a negative piece of information,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush traveled from Florence to Myrtle Beach and on to
Charleston, his continued assertions that the senator's actions did
not match his words appeared to be an explicit attempt to tarnish
the image McCain's supporters have worked hard to promote: that he
is a hero and crusader with unusual integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was perhaps aimed at those independents who could
easily tip the race in one direction or another. But for
Republicans, Bush had another message: that he was their best
chance at winning back the White House, an argument that has been
at the core of his campaign from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent polls suggest that this may not be the case. But
Bush repeatedly insisted, as he has all week long, that Democrats
prepared to vote for McCain in the primaries here on Feb. 19 and in
Michigan on Feb. 22 were simply trying to do Gore a favor.

 &HT;    Memorial honors Georgia's tornado victims
 &HT;    By Dan Chapman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMILLA, Ga. _ The roof was gone, blown away by the tornado that
forced Harris Malcom, his wife and daughter to cower in the hallway
with only a thin mattress for protection.
</P>
<P>
   Pine trees punctured the wooden house. Windows exploded. The
wind, roaring like some unseen demon, whirled glass and books and
clothes and furniture around Malcom, wife Phyllis and 16-year-old
Katie.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it was gone. The Malcoms survived.
</P>
<P>
   Their story is not too dissimilar from those of hundreds of
other South Georgia residents. Yet unlike the farmers, the
teachers, the chicken plant workers and others who experienced
God's fury up close, Harris Malcom is a preacher.
</P>
<P>
   He's the pastor of First Baptist Church in Camilla, where a
memorial service for tornado victims was held Thursday evening amid
much song and prayer and sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The shepherd of a flock numbering 1,000 parishioners, Malcom
clearly holds no special dispensation from above when it comes to
suffering. He expects none and unselfishly deflected any undue
attention paid to his plight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are questioning the love of God right now,'' said
Malcom, 46, outside his soon-to-be-bulldozed home off U.S. 19.
``But the love of God is what spared me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is not why it happened or how it happened,'' he
said. ``Regardless of what happened, at any moment in your life,
you have to be ready to meet God.''
</P>
<P>
   Another round of funerals took place Thursday in this rural
corner of Georgia. Emergency officials listed 18 dead and dozens
injured in the tornadoes and thunderstorms that raked Mitchell,
Colquitt, Tift and Grady counties late Sunday and early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 450 homes were damaged or destroyed. Forty
manufactured homes and travel trailers should arrive Monday to give
temporary housing for those most in need.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state officials kept an eye on possible stormy
weather moving eastward.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's potential for severe weather through this weekend,''
said Jeffrey Jellets, a spokesman for the Georgia Emergency
Management Agency. ``We certainly don't need it.''

 &HT;    Downing, 715 victim, joining Braves booth
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Al Downing forever will be remembered as the pitcher
who threw home run No. 715 to Hank Aaron. But that historic moment
will no longer be his only connection to baseball in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Downing was named as the analyst on Fox Sports Net
South's 30-game Braves package.
</P>
<P>
   Downing succeeds Ernie Johnson Sr. as Bob Rathbun's partner on
the network's schedule of 25 regular-season games and five spring
training telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never talked to Al about that (No. 715), and it had nothing
to do with our decision,'' said Fox Sports Net South executive
producer Steve Craddock. ``I've been aware of Al's work for CBS
Radio on the playoffs, and we wanted a guy with broadcasting
experience, and a guy who had been around the clubhouse as a
broadcaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Craddock said the former pitcher for the Yankees, Dodgers and
Angels also has worked in television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a traditional booth with Bob doing all the
play-by-play,'' Craddock said. ``When analyzing baseball games, the
drama between the pitcher and batter is the most intriguing, so we
needed someone who was a master with the pitch or a master with the
bat. And when we looked at who was available, Al was the logical
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Downing, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., could not be
reached for comment.

 &HT;    Maddux ready as media pops the `big question'
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ The scene was surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Straight off a red-eye flight from Las Vegas, Greg Maddux sat at
his locker in the Braves' clubhouse, wearing his usual golf shirt,
shorts and baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux was the first and only pitcher on hand at 10 a.m.
Thursday, the day Braves pitchers and catchers were scheduled to
report to spring training.
</P>
<P>
   But he was far from alone. He was surrounded by a throng of
national media, both television and print, and he was speaking in
his usual quiet way about a very loud topic.
</P>
<P>
   And reliever John Rocker, still awaiting word on his appeal of
the suspension he received for his controversial comments in Sports
Illustrated, wasn't even there.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ken) Griffey's later, (and) playoffs in other sports don't
start yet,'' Maddux said, shrugging at the attention he was
drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Then he continued with the question about how Rocker will react
upon his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal problems? On the field is usually the only time you
forget about it. Who knows? He was under the gun last year and we
were like, `Wow, go ahead, Rocker.' It'll be that times 100
wherever he goes. Maybe he throws 100 times better, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   In his own soft-spoken way, Maddux might have helped to defuse a
subject the Braves would very much like to forget. Getting ready
for the season officially begins today with workouts for pitchers
and catchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only going to be a distraction if you let it,'' Maddux
said. ``It's not going to distract me. I'll talk to you guys about
it, get on the treadmill, do my PFPs (pitcher's fielding practice),
talk about it again and then find another golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   After general manager John Schuerholz and manager Bobby Cox met
Thursday morning, Cox said the Braves would not issue a gag order
and that players would be asked to use common sense in commenting
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll treat it like it's someone with a sore arm,'' Cox said.
``You mention it, then that's it. It's going to be a dead issue
simply because we've got to get ready for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was a big day for several reasons. Andres Galarraga
arrived in camp ready to intensify his climb back from a yearlong
bout with lymphoma. Galarraga has been soft-tossing since December
but today plans to start swinging against pitching from coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I almost started crying when I came here,''
Galarraga said, referring to the day he spoke publicly for the
first time since his illness was revealed. ``Now I'm happy. I'm
excited. (I've had) no problems, no pain. Everything is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern is how his back will respond to the rigors of
swinging against major-league pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (back) is strong enough not to break it,'' Galarraga said.
``In my mind, I'm ready to go. . . . They want me to go easy. They
know me. They don't want me to push it too much now.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Perez was set to take his first swings in a batting cage
Thursday since he had surgery on his nonthrowing shoulder in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg, coming back from ligament surgery, last week
revved up his throwing to between 85 percent and 90 percent. On
Thursday, he described it this way: ``No pain, the ball was live,
good control, feels almost too good.''
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing close to a decision has been made about a
closer. But Maddux had his own funny contribution to that question,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see _ maybe Ligtenberg, maybe Rudy (Seanez), maybe
Smoltzie,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz, probably on a golf course, wasn't there to defend
himself.

   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The newest event of Speedweeks at Daytona
International Speedway could be the most exciting.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's Craftsman Truck Series will stage a 250-mile race here
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to see more drafting than you'd even believe,''
said Bobby Hamilton, who is running Winston Cup and truck races
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Safety restrictions placed by NASCAR and the aerodynamic
disadvantage of the trucks' boxy shape, Hamilton said, will allow
drivers to race the way Winston Cup drivers could in the era before
restrictor plates changed strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have two people racing for the lead, and the guy
behind them can pass them both if he hits it right,'' said
Hamilton, who will start fifth. ``You don't need any help.''
</P>
<P>
   If the situation changes, help is nearby. Joe Ruttman,
Hamilton's teammate, starts on the pole.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grissom, a former Winston Cup regular, will start a Petty
Enterprises Dodge from the 10th starting spot. He said he agrees
with Hamilton that trucks give drivers more options.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the trucks, you can go ahead and make a move,'' Grissom
said. ``If it doesn't work out, the truck can pull itself back up
and you won't lose the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed will be governed by an air cleaner that has been changed
to limit air flow, thus hampering engine performance. The rear
spoiler also must be an inch taller, which slows the trucks and
makes them drive better.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said the restrictions should succeed in providing a
margin of safety for a group with little experience on a track such
as Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are doing well in practice. And they've got the
trucks driving so well that you're going to have to really put
yourself in a bad position for it to get out from under you,''
Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Truck drivers have run on 1.5-mile and 2-mile superspeedways
before, but this is the first time on a 2.5-mile track.

MODANO RELINQUISHES EXTRA RESPONSIBILITIES
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The return of defenseman Derian Hatcher to the
Dallas Stars' lineup tonight means center Mike Modano will have to
return the ``C'' on his sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Modano has been captain since Hatcher was sidelined by a
lacerated calf muscle on Dec. 17. He usually fills in when
Hatcher's hurt, but this has been his longest stint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been fun having it,'' said Modano, who took the ``C''
pretty seriously. ``I think responsibility is the big thing,
knowing each and every night you have to come to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano isn't kidding when he said the responsibility came at
just the right time.
</P>
<P>
   In the 30 games before being selected captain, Modano had 11
goals and 11 assists. In the 23 games since, Modano had 13 goals
and 16 assists. NIEUWENDYK ON SCHEDULE
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk is he's on
schedule to return from his separated shoulder in the eight-week
time frame first given by doctors. The bad news for him is that's
another three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing pretty good,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``It's getting
better all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk said he has been able to feel the improvement while
lifting weights and stretching. He said he expects to begin skating
next week while the team is on a three-game road trip. MARSHALL
DISAPPOINTED
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated doesn't even begin to explain winger Grant Marshall's
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm frustrated,'' Marshall said. ``I've only got one
point in 24 games or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't exaggerating either. He has more torn groins (two) this
season than points (one). But Marshall said he has been trying not
to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting to the point now where I know I am working hard,''
Marshall said. ``If I get points, I get points. If I don't, I
don't.'' BUILDING A LEAD
</P>
<P>
   At times during the season, six points barely separated the
entire Pacific Division. Now, the Stars, winners of nine of 11,
have the opportunity to take a six-point lead over second-place
Phoenix with a victory tonight against the Coyotes at Reunion
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars dominated the Coyotes, 2-0, in Phoenix before the
All-Star break to draw even in points, and despite all the problems
and distractions of this season, the Stars lead the season series,
2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it makes teams and players wonder how we're still
doing it,'' Mike Modano said. ``They're still asking themselves
that question, a lot of coaches are, I'm sure, surprised,
bewildered how we're still keeping track with everyone else and
still winning with all these new faces and changes.'' THIS AND THAT
</P>
<P>
   Surgery on winger Jere Lehtinen's ankle went well, coach Ken
Hitchcock said. Lehtinen is expected to miss six weeks, returning
on April 2 against Colorado. ... In their past 15 games at Reunion
Arena, the Stars have played in seven one-goal games. They are
undefeated in them. ... Ed Belfour will be in goal for the Stars
tonight. nn

POSSIBLE NEW TREATMENT FOUND FOR SERIOUS LIVER DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A possible new approach to treating cirrhosis of the liver, the
seventh-leading cause of death in the world, has emerged from
studies of telomerase, a recently discovered agent that
indefinitely prolongs the life of human cells grown in the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   So far the treatment has worked only in mice that have
artificially been given cirrhosis. If it works in people, too, it
would offer a new way of tackling a major, intractable disease, as
well as of averting liver cancer, the leading cause of cancer cases
worldwide, 80 percent of which originate from liver cirrhosis.
</P>
<P>
   The research is the work of Dr. Ronald A. DePinho, a mouse
geneticist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and colleagues, and
is reported in Friday's issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irwin A. Arias, a liver expert at Tufts University, said
that the work was ``brilliant'' but that any treatment was ``a
long, long way off.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirrhosis is the scarring of the liver that results when toxins
like alcohol or hepatitis viruses B and C kill the liver cells and
exhaust the organ's usual capacity to regenerate itself. The
scarring blocks blood flow and the liver's ability to function
properly, leading to symptoms that can be postponed but not
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanism by which the various liver toxins cause cirrhosis
is unknown, but Japanese scientists recently noticed that liver
cells from cirrhosis patients had an anomaly in their chromosomes,
the giant DNA molecules in which the cell's programming
instructions are encoded. Specifically, the end sections of the
chromosomes, known as the telomeres, were unusually short. Each
time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter, as if counting off
some permissible number of divisions, until at a certain minimum
telomere length the cell is thrown into crisis and dies.
</P>
<P>
   Telomeres are kept long in egg and sperm cells by the enzyme
telomerase. But the telomerase gene is suppressed in most normal
cells, and as people age, their telomeres decrease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists supported by Geron Corp. of Menlo Park, Calif.,
discovered recently that human cells grown in glassware could be
made to divide indefinitely _ becoming in principle immortal _ if
given an active copy of the telomerase gene that builds their
telomeres back to youthful length.
</P>
<P>
   Telomeres in general do not seem to place a limit on human life
span. Their purpose seems to be as a last-ditch defense against
tumors, zapping malignant cells after they have reached their
quotas of divisions.
</P>
<P>
   But some biologists believe short telomeres may be a drawback in
diseases where a cell type is forced to divide unusually often.
When DePinho heard of the Japanese finding of short telomeres in
cirrhosis, he decided to test the idea in mice by seeing if
insertion of the telomerase gene into liver cells could prevent the
development of cirrhosis.
</P>
<P>
   Mice have very long telomeres, so to obtain animals with
telomeres as short as those of elderly people, he took a strain
that lacked the telomerase gene altogether and bred the mice
through several generations.
</P>
<P>
   Cirrhosis was induced in the short-telomere mice by injecting
them with a liver-poisoning chemical. In addition, one group of
mice was injected with a virus carrying a copy of the mouse
telomerase gene. In these mice, development of cirrhosis was
blocked, presumably because the telomerase rescued certain
short-telomere cells from crisis, enabling them to regenerate the
liver.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this finding, DePinho and colleagues conclude, ``It
is reasonable to anticipate that activation of telomerase could
inhibit the development of liver cirrhosis or terminal liver
failure in humans.''
</P>
<P>
   If the telomere-shortening system protects against cancer, an
artificial lengthening of the telomeres might raise a cancer risk.
In their article, the authors suggest the telomerase treatment
could be tested in patients awaiting a liver transplant, since the
liver was due for removal anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Calvin Harley, scientific director of Geron, the company
developing telomerase-based therapies, said DePinho's work was ``a
pretty important first step in establishing that telomere loss can
be the trigger of chronic disease.'' Geron has also been working on
telomere-based treatments for cirrhosis, but any clinical tests of
a treatment are ``certainly not less than two years away,'' Harley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arias, the Tufts liver expert, interpreted DePinho's work more
cautiously, saying it was too early even to be sure that short
telomeres were the trigger for cirrhosis. Because many questions
remain about the timing of telomere shortening and the types of
cirrhosis in which shortening occurs, ``It is not a good idea to
speculate about the therapeutic aspects or suggest that a clinical
trial can be done instantly,'' Arias said.
</P>
<P>
   DePinho inserted the telomerase gene into mice by piggy-backing
it onto a disabled adenovirus, one of the causes of the common
cold. Though the virus itself is considered pretty harmless, its
use in gene therapy has fallen under a cloud after the death of
Jesse Gelsinger, a patient being treated for a rare metabolic
disease at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   DePinho and Harley said there were many other methods besides
adenovirus for delivering both the telomerase gene and the
telomerase protein itself.
</P>
<P>
   Besides cirrhosis, several other diseases are thought, though
not yet proved, to be caused by telomere shortening and the
depletion of critical cell types. They include AIDS, ulcerative
colitis and various skin and immune-system disorders.
</P>
<P>
   In another report in Science, a team of Japanese and American
scientists describe a method for growing enough liver cells in
glassware to regenerate the organ when the cells are injected back
into rats. The method depends on first infecting the cells with a
tumor gene that makes them divide. The tumor gene can be completely
excised from the cells after they have divided.

 &HT;    Twin upsets at Daytona
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Bill Elliott took the checkered flag in
Thursday's first Twin 125 and will start third in Sunday's Daytona
500, behind Dale Jarrett and Ricky Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia native, who hasn't won a Winston Cup race in nearly
six years, said the fast start at Daytona was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was very critical,'' Elliott said. ``For as hard as
our team has worked through the winter, to be able to come out and
qualify third and win the 125, it was a critical point for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, driving the No. 94 Ford, also ended the record streak
of a longtime rival.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Thursday's events, Dale Earnhardt had won a Twin 125
for the past 10 years, dating back to 1990. Earnhardt started third
but fell to 11th by the finish. It led to a disappointing No. 21
start in Sunday's Daytona 500 and a rare postrace outburst by the
Intimidator.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the worst racing I've seen at Daytona in a long time,''
Earnhardt said. ``They took NASCAR Winston Cup racing and made it
some of the sorriest racing. They took the racing out of the hands
of the drivers and the crews. They just killed racing at Daytona.
It's a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who rarely blasts the sport's governing body, says
NASCAR's new rules requiring all teams to run the same shocks,
along with equal distribution of the weight of the cars, is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Both races were boring, several Winston Cup drivers said. It was
mostly single-file racing, with no cautions or lead changes during
either of the 50-lap events. Elliott took the lead from Jarrett
just after the starting line. In the second race, Rudd started and
finished first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Daytona 500 and I think you'll see an exciting race.
. . . I hope so,'' Rudd said. ``I mean, the fans didn't pay a lot
of money to come and see us run single file, I think they want us
to run three-wide. I think a lot of (drivers) just wanted to get
these races . . . behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of surprises Thursday. In the first race,
Scott Pruett solidified his status as Daytona's top rookie by
finishing eighth, earning the No. 15 spot in the big event. In the
final race, Dale Earnhardt Jr. passed seven drivers to end up in
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers having to take provisionals were Bobby Hamilton,
Sterling Marlin, Kenny Wallace, Elliott Sadler, Kevin Lepage, Kyle
Petty and Darrell Waltrip.

TEXAS MOVES (SMART OR LUCKY?) PAY OFF
</HEADLINE>
 12-JONES COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of circumstance is sometimes genius born. And sometimes, stuff
just happens.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sharp eye that recognizes good fortune and so it is
that Texas coach Rick Barnes has discovered a method in his recent
madness.
</P>
<P>
   Recall that Barnes dropped both guard Will Clay and forward Gabe
Muoneke from the starting lineup recently for disciplinary reasons.
Clay missed an early flight to Massachusetts. Gabe? Well, Gabe in
his words, ``made coach Barnes mad'' at practice the day before the
Longhorns played Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The point now is that Barnes ``likes'' using both players off
the bench, not that he disciplined two seniors. And that's where
some people have missed the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain things happen and you have to do things,'' Barnes
said. ``But it's like with family, you don't hold it over someone's
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in practice with Gabe obviously made me do what
I did. But I actually liked it. I felt he was good coming off the
bench. He was great against Missouri and great \Ragainst Oklahoma
State\S. The thing that bothers me right now is, I don't want
people to think Gabe is being disciplined over something that is
over and done with. And the same thing with Will.''
</P>
<P>
   So, prying minds want to know, how does Gabe feel about it?
Truth be told, Gabe said this week he'd just as soon be in the
starting lineup because he's a senior and he has been introduced as
a starter for most of three seasons. But he could get that out of
his mind if people stopped asking him about it.
</P>
<P>
   The most misunderstood player I've known in 30 years, however,
has accepted his new role. He played 32 minutes and was the
difference-maker in Wednesday night's victory against No. 8 OSU
that sends Texas into Baylor tomorrow (12:45 p.m.) at 9-2, even
with the Cowboys and a game back of leader Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe also understands that Barnes' latest moves are part of an
evolving plan for March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Barnes has been doing this a long time,'' Gabe said.
``He knows what he's going to do in his head. Right now, he's
seeing how different things work. The most important thing is
winning. I believe that once March Madness starts, once the \RNCAA
Tournament\S seeding comes out, coach Barnes will say OK, this is
what I've done. This is what works best. And now we're going to get
after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes knows what he gets from Muoneke, Clay, Chris Mihm, Ivan
Wagner and lately Darren Kelly, who was just short of sensational
against both Missouri and OSU. Starting Chris Owens and Lawrence
Williams gives Barnes a chance to see what he might be getting from
two players who can be impressive in bursts. But that's their
problem, the time between bursts. Muoneke's all-around game and
Clay's defense change the game when they check in. And Gabe
relieves either Owens or Mihm _ or Williams or Kelly if Barnes
wants to go big as he did in the stretch Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing that amused, mad-scientist look he sometimes gets,
Barnes says the tinkering might continue. But if he doesn't put
Muoneke back into the starting lineup, Gabe won't bear a grudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love coach Barnes to death,'' Gabe said. ``Nothing that goes
on on the court is personal. I've never had any malicious feelings
for coach Barnes at all. What happened at practice that day wasn't
him. It was me. There were some other things bothering me that day
and I was in a bad mood. It was good that he busted my butt when he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   In ways then yet unknown. A&AMP;M'S KING DISCOVERS PRACTICE, SCORING
RELATED
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M freshman Bernard King has reappeared in the running
for Big 12 rookie of the year after a difficult January.
</P>
<P>
   During one stretch last month, King made only 16 of 55 shots
from the floor. In February, he has again found his stroke. In the
past four games, including a 3-for-20 game against Oklahoma State,
King is 28-for-56 and has hit 16 of 37 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started with last week's practice,'' A&AMP;M coach Melvin
Watkins said. ``We sat down and had a conversation with him about
how hard you have to practice every day. We ask a lot from him and
it's been tough on him. But still, we know his potential and after
a good week of practice, it's good to see him let it shine on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   King followed his Big 12 freshman record 34-point game against
Colorado with 21 points in a losing cause against Baylor on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   His 16.7-point average ranks fifth nationally among Division I
freshmen. He is on pace to break the Big 12 freshman scoring record
set by close friend and fellow north Louisiana product Marcus
Fizer, who averaged 14.7 points in his first season at Iowa State
three years ago. King is averaging 2.73 3-point shots per game,
which would eclipse Luke Axtell's freshman record of 2.43, also set
in the 1997-98 season. UT STUDENTS SPEAK
</P>
<P>
   In a recent story about upcoming changes involving the Erwin
Center, both Texas men's coach Rick Barnes and women's athletic
director and coach Jody Conradt urged some sort of immediate
reconfiguration to make students more a part of the games.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't musing idly. Except for a service group of about
two dozen guys who paint their faces, students aren't even remotely
a part of games. Part of that reason is the fact that their seats _
most above the band behind a basket at one end of the court _
stink. That was reflected by the fact that students returned for
public sale almost half of their 4,000-seat allotment for the
Longhorns' Wednesday night game against Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not coming and my question is why?'' Barnes said.
``One thing I will never buy into is the fact that they once had
\Rbetter seat locations\S and didn't use them \Rin the early 90s\S.
I'm not concerned with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we've got 1,000 students standing in each end zone,
it would have a tremendous effect on the game. I do believe there
is a way we can get 2,000 students on the floor where they can make
a lot of noise and make a lot of difference \Rin the atmosphere\S.
That's one of the things we've got to work on.''
</P>

   UT athletic director DeLoss Dodds says the announcement of the
Erwin Center coming under the auspices of the athletic department
is imminent, pending minor details. IT AIN'T OVER 'TILL ...
</P>
<P>
   Just when it looked like Iowa State was in a commanding position
for its first Big 12 women's title and the accompanying No. 1 seed
in the conference tournament, along comes tomorrow's pivotal game
involving Oklahoma and an old familiar face, Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   A victory in the nationally televised (ESPN2, 1 p.m.) affair in
Lubbock would thrust the No. 12 Lady Raiders (20-3, 9-3) into a tie
with No. 18 Oklahoma (20-5, 10-2) and could create a four-way jam
in the loss column with Kansas and Iowa State, which doesn't play
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Or, a loss could drop Tech to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a mess,'' Tech coach Marsha Sharp said. ``You can go from
first to fifth in about two hours' time these days. It's
unbelievable. We've talked a lot about the strength of our
conference all the way through and it's been proven out.''
</P>
<P>
   The OU game will be the first national exposure for Tech's new
arena since the Lady Raiders christened it in November with a
victory over Louisiana State on the Lifetime Network. ESPN2 gets
into a few more homes. Should be about 13,000 fans at United Spirit
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great thing for our conference,'' Sharp said. ``The
atmosphere, everything on the line with national exposure. Just
great for the Big 12.'' FREE THROWS
</P>
<P>
   -- A hint on when you know this is your season. Iowa State's
Marcus Fizer hit the winning shot in the Cyclones' 64-62 victory at
Kansas on what was described as an improbable 17-foot turnaround
jumper from the right corner with 6.2 seconds left, just before the
shot clock expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deflected the ball,'' KU center Eric Chenowith said.
``That's probably what made it go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer, who scored 12 of his 15 points in the second half, said
he was thinking bank shot off the glass when he shot. It swished
instead.
</P>
<P>
   -- So here is Kansas (17-6, 7-4), hanging on in sixth place and
playing for the fourth and final seed (based this year on 1-4 in
the conference standings).
</P>
<P>
   ``This one hurts,'' coach Roy Williams said after the Iowa State
loss. ``It's one I'm going to remember for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Been a couple of those this season.
</P>
<P>
   -- There had to be some question about the Texas women's chances
of returning to the NCAA Tournament after last season's surprising
invitation following a 16-11 season and a first-round loss in the
Big 12 tournament. But the Longhorns (17-8, 8-4) now look good for
an NCAA reprise if they can split down the regular-season stretch
(at Colorado, Texas Tech, at Texas A&AMP;M, Iowa State).
</P>
<P>
   Why? UT plays one of the top schedules nationally and now has
three victories over ranked opponents in nine Top 25 games after
Wednesday's improbable victory at No. 18 Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   -- The NCAA is investigating possible rules violations by the
Iowa State men's team, the Des Moines Register reported yesterday.
According to the newspaper, the investigation apparently focuses on
Ernest Brown, a 7-foot center playing at Indian Hills Community
College in Ottumwa, Iowa. Brown signed a letter of intent with Iowa
State last fall. ISU athletic director Gene Smith has acknowledged
the school received a preliminary letter of inquiry from the NCAA.
Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy said he is confident the NCAA will
find nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   -- Baylor's DeMarcus Minor is due for a rest. He's averaging
39.4 minutes a game in the Big 12. He could break the conference
record set by former Texas shooting star Reggie Freeman, who
averaged 38.5 minutes in 16 games in 1997. Following Minor in
minutes played this season are ISU guards Michael Nurse (37.6) and
Kantrail Horton (36.9).  &QL; 
INSIDE THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's victory over UT-Pan American this week was the last
nonconference game of the 2000 season for Big 12 men's teams,
giving the conference its most victories over non-league foes in
its four-year existence. A look back: Year W-L Pct. 1996-97 104-32
.765 1997-98 96-45 .681 1998-99 98-51 .658 1999-00 108-40 .729

ANALYSIS: GREENSPAN IS TUNED OUT BY TECHNOLOGY INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>
   (See also FED-GREENSPAN) 
(rk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Alan Greenspan speaks, the old economy trembles. But the
new one thinks it is impervious to higher interest rates, and
shrugs off warnings from the Fed chairman.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the pattern since the Fed began to raise interest
rates last summer, and it continued Thursday. Greenspan's stark
warnings that short-term interest rates will continue to rise had
only a brief impact on the Nasdaq composite index, which is
dominated by high-technology companies that are benefiting from the
digital revolution.
</P>
<P>
   That index then shot up 121.27 points, or 2.7 percent, to a new
high of 4,548.92, as the Nasdaq market traded 2 billion shares for
the first time. The index is up 69 percent since June 30, the date
of the first of the Fed's four rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   But the story was different for the Dow Jones industrial
average, which is far more dependent on stocks that are liable to
be hurt as higher interest rates slow the economy. It fell 100
points within minutes after the Fed chairman began testifying;
while it recovered some of that, it ended down 46.84 points, or
almost half a percentage point, at 10,514.57. It is down about 4
percent since June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus reaction on Wall Street seemed to be that little
was new in the chairman's testimony. ``Maybe he's raised his own
estimate'' of how high interest rates have to go to slow the
economy, said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith
Barney. ``But he didn't say we needed to get there faster.''
</P>
<P>
   For some time the fixed-income markets have been expecting at
least two more increases in short-term rates by the Fed, with the
first one, of at least a quarter percentage point, expected next
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chairman's comments did not trigger any massive
re-evaluation of where the Fed is going,'' said Louis Crandall, the
chief economist of Wrightson Associates, a bond market research
firm. ``If anything, it may have made people a little more
nervous'' that the next increase might be a half percentage point,
rather than the quarter-point raise seen in the previous increases.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term interest rates rose moderately Thursday, though it
was unclear how much of that was caused by Greenspan's remarks and
how much by other factors, including a report by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia that indicated rising price pressures
for manufacturing companies.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Greenspan noted the willingness of many stock
investors to shrug off the risk of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, rising business earnings expectations and declining
compensation for risk have more than offset'' the impact of higher
rates, he said. But he forecast that, at some point, rates would
rise enough to have an impact on the expectations of stock market
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan seems dead set on taking the punch bowl from the
party,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief equity strategist at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``The market is understanding that
interest rates will continue to head higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig &AMP; Co., agreed.
Greenspan, he said, ``is committed to ending, for a time, outsized
gains for the equity market.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks, however, do not stop going up just because interest
rates rise. They stop going up because investors stop bidding them
up. So far, it appears, higher interest rates have alarmed
investors in many industries. General Electric, Coca-Cola and
Citigroup were among the Dow stocks that fell by at least a dollar
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But those losses were partly offset by gains in Microsoft, Intel
and IBM. Technology stock investors are not worried about higher
interest rates, and Wednesday's forceful testimony from Greenspan
did not change that.

AIRLINE ACCUSES BOEING OF WITHHOLDING TEST INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Officials of an airline that quit buying Boeing planes
in favor of Airbus claimed the Seattle aerospace giant withheld
vital information that could have prevented a disastrous air crash
near Pittsburgh in 1994. In previously confidential court documents
that were unsealed this week, the two US Airways officials accused
Boeing of witholding information about its 737 flight test program.
That information could have prevented the crash of the airline's
Flight 427 near Pittsburgh in 1994, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were part of a petition for punitive damages filed
by attorneys representing families of two of the 132 passengers and
crew who died when the 737 rolled over and dived into a gully near
Aliquippa, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Though the two cases were recently settled out of court, the
documents show the depth of the falling out between Boeing and US
Airways, which had been a good Boeing customer before the
Pittsburgh crash.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the two companies settled a legal dispute involing the
airline's cancellation of Boeing airplane orders in favor of planes
made by Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing strongly denied the allegations by the two US Airways
officials and said the information in question was made available
to the Federal Aviation Administration when the airplane was being
certified in 1984 for commercial operation.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA pilot was in the cockpit of a 737-300 during a test
flight when it experienced the aerodynamic phenomenon that US
Airways now claims Boeing tried to hide, Craig Martin, Boeing's
chief 737 spokesman, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always been upfront and honest with the FAA,'' Mike
Denton, former chief engineer for the 737, said in an intrveiew.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was disturbed by the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They paint a picture of the Boeing Co. that is so different
than the company I work for,'' he said. ``If that (allegation) were
true, I would not work here.''
</P>
<P>
   After the longest crash investigation in U.S. history, the
National Transportation Safety Board ruled last March that the
probable cause of the crash of Flight 427 was a malfunction of the
plane's rudder, the moveable part on a plane's tail that controls
the side to side movement. (A pilot banks or turns a plane by using
ailerons that raise or lower the wings, not by moving the rudder.)
</P>
<P>
   A hydraulic valve that moves the 737 rudder likely jammed,
causing it to fully deflect in the opposite direction commanded by
the flight crew, the board said. But it acknowledged that even
after five years of hard work there was no actual physical proof
that is what happened.
</P>
<P>
   For Boeing, the 737 rudder issue will not go away.
</P>
<P>
   The previously confidential documents about the crash were
unsealed this week in a Cook County circuit court in Chicago. They
included depositions from US Airways officials as well as
confidential internal Boeing documents.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said it decided to lift previous objections to the
documents being unsealed ``so that we can set the record
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the court record includes Boeing's legal response to
the petitions, the company prepared for reporters a 16-page page
paper titled ``USAir 427 litigation: The Boeing Perspective.'' It
refutes point by point various allegations made by the lawyers for
the two plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The two Chicago plaintiffs who had been seeking punitive damages
recently settled out of court, and the judge never ruled on the
petitions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the petitions was filed by the widow of Timothy McCoy of
Chicago, a passenger on USAir Fligth 427. The estate received a
record $62 million in damages in the out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   James Gibbs, who was flight manager for USAir at the time of the
Pittsburgh crash, and Gordon Kemp, the airline's 737 flight
manager, both gave depositions that are included in the now-public
court file. (Since the crash USAir changed its name to US Airways.)
</P>
<P>
   If Boeing had not withheld 737 flight test data, Gibbs said in
his deposition, the crew of Flight 427 would have successfully been
able to fly out of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Gibbs deposition was taken 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The flight test data in question involves the 737's flying
characteristic at a certain speed and flap settings. Flaps, one of
the moveable parts of a plane's wings, are extended upon landing to
provide more lift at slower speeds. Flight 427 was preparing to
land at the Pittsburgh airport when it crashed. The jet was moving
at 190 knots and the crew had just extended flaps to what's known
as ``flaps one,'' the initial deployment position.
</P>
<P>
   During its flight test program on the 737 in 1984, Boeing found
that at a speed of 190 knots and the flap one setting, the plane
could not overcome a full rudder deflection with the ailerons on
the wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no FAA requirement that says this phenomenon is not
acceptable,'' Denton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Pittsburgh crash and subsequent
investigation, airlines have instructed their pilots to fly the 737
at 10 knots faster when first deploying the flaps.
</P>
<P>
   This keeps the plane above what's known as the ``crossover
speed'' so the ailerons can overcome a full rudder deflection. The
higher speed was officially adopted into Boeing's 737 operating
manual last March.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs and Kemp said in their depositions that no one with Boeing
ever told them the 737's crossover speed was higher than that being
flown by USAir pilots at the time of the Pittsburgh crash.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for US Airways said yesterday the airline had no
comment on the depositions, but noted that the final report on the
crash by the safety board supported the actions taken by the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Denton, who is now an engineering executive with Boeing's
product development team, said the information about the 737's
crossover speed was not hidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information was out there,'' he said. ``I don't know if
the airlines saw the certification data or had access to it. But it
was an observed phenomenon, one that was not viewed as unacceptable
by the FAA.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there was a discussion about the 737 flight test data in
the safety board's report on the 1991 crash of a United Airlines
737 as it prepared to land in Colorado Springs. Initially, the
board said no cause for the crash could be determined, though a
ruder malfunction was suspected. Last March, when the board issued
its final report on the Pittsburgh crash, it said the probable
cause of the United crash was a similar uncommanded deflection of
the rudder.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the USAir 737 was flying 10 knots faster, it probably
would not have made any difference, according to Boeing. That's
because the pilots had not been trained in the proper procedures to
recover from the kind of upset that sent Flight 427 rolling over on
its back and into a fatal dive.
</P>
<P>
   Denton said Boeing conducted simulator tests and found that
pilots who waited three second to take appropriate corrective
action in event of a full rudder deflection had a much more
difficult time recovering the airplane than if they waited only one
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The added 10 knots didn't buy you a lot if you waited three
seconds,'' Denton said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing says officially that it accepts the safety's board
findings in the Pittsburgh crash. But Boeing engineers such as
Denton are not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an engineer it drives me nuts that we don't know what
caused that full rudder displacement for a fact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to look at all the data. We truly don't know.''

ROVE, WEAVER, ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF GOP CAMPAIGN, HAVE MUCH IN
COMMON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ They don't like to talk about each other, but
Karl Rove and John Weaver have more than a few things in common.
</P>
<P>
   They're both Texas political consultants, they're both die-hard
Republicans, and each is at the epicenter of the Republican
nomination battle between Gov. George W. Bush and Sen John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   And as the battle heats up going into Saturday's dramatic South
Carolina showdown, the rivalry between Weaver and Rove looms almost
as large as the one shared by the candidates they serve.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, 40, recruited McCain to run for president three years
ago and is now his political director. Rove, 49, has been
dispensing political advice to the Bush family since the 1970s and
is now the governor's chief strategist.
</P>
<P>
   There is no love lost between the two, though each declined to
talk about what split up their once warm friendship. But the Lone
Star intrigue behind the scenes of the 2000 race has not gone
unnoticed back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little ironic that in the presidential race in 2000,
the subtext is that these two people emerge again in a Titanic
battle,'' said one veteran Texas GOP campaign aide. ``Karl has
always had the upper hand. We'll see this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning conventional wisdom on its head, Weaver devised a
guerrilla strategy that entailed skipping the expensive Iowa
caucuses and focusing on four early primaries _ New Hampshire,
South Carolina, Michigan and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, meanwhile, orchestrated an early ``front porch campaign''
that brought hundreds of supporters to Bush's doorstep in Austin,
asking him to get in the race. The strategy propelled Bush into the
fundraising stratosphere and gave him an early lead in opinion
polls that most experts once considered insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   But when McCain trounced Bush in New Hampshire with 18 points to
spare, Weaver's strategy and the Arizona senator's candidacy _
which Rove and others had only weeks before dismissed _ suddenly
seemed credible.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, in an interview in South Carolina on Friday, said he was
inspired in part by the 1984 campaign of Gary Hart, who gave
Democratic Party favorite Walter Mondale a scare after winning the
New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Kermit, a small outpost between Odessa and El Paso,
Weaver got his start in Republican politics after meeting Phil
Gramm at Texas A&AMP;M University. When Gramm, then a professor, ran
for the U.S. Senate, Weaver became his political director.
</P>
<P>
   It was during his tenure as political director for Gramm's 1996
presidential run that Weaver met McCain and thought he'd make a
good candidate. Three years ago, he pulled McCain out of a
committee hearing in Washington and told him he ought to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw how he connected with voters,'' Weaver said. ``I thought
if there was ever an opportunity for someone to return our party
back to its roots and connect with the American people it would be
the post Clinton era and it would be John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, who twice worked for Bush's father, said he likes the
governor and notes that he and his wife both contributed to the
governor's past gubernatorial campaigns. He said the race is not
personal but instead is about ``electing the best president.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on the Bush campaign's strategy, which Rove
largely devised, Weaver said the governor's team ``certainly raised
a lot of money. That was one thing that they showed they could do
beyond anybody's wildest imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weaver criticized the campaign's recent use of negative ads:
``They seem to have multiple strategies (since) right after New
Hampshire. They settled on a scorched earth strategy. That's not
surprising. There's nothing more panicked than an establishment
cornered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials say McCain started the negative campaigning, and
dismiss his decision to unilaterally halt his own attack ads as
proof they backfired. For his part, Rove has repeatedly lashed out
at McCain in television interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not with him he belittles you, he makes fun of you,
he disparages you,'' Rove told CNN. ``That's not the mark of a
leader who can unite this party and win the White house.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove, a Colorado native, got his start in politics as a member
of the College Republicans, a national student organization. It was
there that he met Lee Atwater, a South Carolina native who went on
to run President Bush's successful 1988 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming chairman of the GOP college group, Rove was
investigated by the Republican National Committee for allegedly
trying to teach students how to engage in political ``dirty
tricks.'' The committee exonerated him, and Rove went to work for
the RNC chairman _ George Bush, the governor's father.
</P>
<P>
   He has been an adviser to the Bush family ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Rove is a near-mythic fixture in Texas politics. He has been
involved in virtually every successful Republican candidacy since
the late 1970s, and is considered by political activists one of the
chief architects of the modern Texas GOP.
</P>
<P>
   One columnist called Rove ``Bush's brain,'' and the moniker has
stuck.
</P>
<P>
   According to associates, Rove and Weaver first became friends
when the two worked on Gramm's successful 1984 Senate campaign. A
few years later, they became entangled in a billing dispute when
Weaver was head of Vice-President Bush's 1988 presidential campaign
and Rove was a paid Bush consultant, GOP sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Rove became the dominant political consultant in
Texas _ and Weaver his competitor. Against that backdrop, the
stakes are extra high in South Carolina for both Texans. Rove would
not predict victory, saying it's ``going to be a close election,
potentially a long night.'' Polls show the race a statistical dead
heat.
</P>
<P>
   For Weaver, no matter what happens, the McCain campaign will be
his last, he said. When it's over, he said he's going to find a
less stressful and time consuming line of work so he can spend more
time with his wife and 7-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've missed a lot of my daughter growing up, and my wife, I
need to be with her more,'' Weaver said. ``It's time to do
something else. This is a young person's business.''

DODGERS' GAGNE CONFIDENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ The Los Angeles Dodgers like rookie
right-hander Eric Gagne so much they traded talented but
underachieving Ismael Valdes this winter. Gagne's talent is
unmistakable, but the plus side is he possesses the mental
toughness Valdes lacked.
</P>
<P>
   And Gagne, 24, is also confident in his ability.
</P>
<P>
   He's the leading candidate in a four-pitcher race (with Orel
Hershiser, Carlos Perez and Jeff Williams) for one of the last two
spots in the rotation. In his mind, though, there's no question
where he'll be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will,'' Gagne said of impressing Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson. ``I have to stay confident. I've been working real hard in
the offseason. I expect to be in the rotation. I know they have the
final choice, but I expect to be in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers aren't asking Gagne to be the fifth starter and
just give some good efforts. He's penciled in for the fourth spot,
and the team's hierarchy thinks his physical and mental
capabilities can push him to second or third in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   While pitchers and catchers didn't report to Dodgertown until
Thursday, Gagne's been here for the past month working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be in the right mental frame of mind,'' Gagne
said. ''You can't do that when there's snow on the ground in
Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the ticket: Even though Montreal is a hockey city, Gagne,
a French-Canadian, said there's been a lot of talk about the Expos
all winter. And he's even heard his name mentioned prominently on
radio shows and in the newspapers. The Dodgers open the season with
a four-game trip to Montreal, and Gagne could pitch the series
finale April 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it's sold out,'' Gagne said. ``A French-Canadian
player there? That's huge. It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's role settled: Bullpen or starting rotation? It's a
question Darren Dreifort's dealt with for the last two seasons, but
it finally appears settled. He's a starter now, and will be one for
the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have that behind us,'' said the right-hander, who
went 13-13, 4.79 ERA last season. ``I know the second half of the
season I felt a lot more prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a big season for Dreifort to prove once and for
all he can and should start, but it's also a free-agent year, and
he's expected to test the market after the season and could be one
of the top young pitchers available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, I have a job to do here,'' Dreifort said.
``Whatever happens, happens. I'm not going to concern myself with
the next five years unless you can get through this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetters feels ready: Right-hander Mike Fetters, a Van Nuys
native and Pepperdine product, signed a minor-league contract with
the Dodgers before they added Dan Naulty, Terry Adams and Gregg
Olson to the roster. However, he said he believes he can contend
for a spot in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the best I've felt in four or five years,'' said
Fetters, who had arm surgery last June. ''They told me I should
have had the surgery three years ago, and that's when I started
pitching (poorly). I'm excited. I'm looking at this like I'm a
rookie trying to make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetters, who's pitched for five teams, appeared in 27 games last
season for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Comings and more comings: The majority of pitchers and catchers
arrived Thursday, and staff ace Kevin Brown is expected today. ...
While the Dodgers say Alex Cora, Juan Castro and Jose Vizcaino will
contend for the shortstop job, Cora has a huge lead in the race.
And the Dodgers were pleased Cora arrived in Dodgertown on
Thursday, five days ahead of the voluntary reporting date for
position players.

LITTLE RICHARD SINGS AN ODE TO HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This just in: It's been a whopping 10 days since ``Who Wants to
Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' was taped in Las Vegas, and Rick and
Darva Rockwell remain married.
</P>
<P>
   In related news, the show was a hit on Tuesday night, and Fox
plans an hourlong encore version on Tuesday. It will replace the
previously scheduled ``Banned in America: The World's Sexiest
Television.''
</P>
<P>
   Take a moment to let that soak in _ OK, that's enough _ and
we'll move along to Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The early rock 'n' roll star Little Richard always seemed more
of a force of nature than a carbon-based package of humanity, so
maybe his story lends itself to the cartoonish treatment it gets
Sunday on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'd have expected something at least a little weightier
than the frothy and shamelessly self-serving ``Little Richard.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-serving because although the star of the movie is the
one-named Leon (``The Temptations,'' ``The Five Heartbeats''), the
executive producer is none other than Little Richard, who modestly
allows himself to be called ``the architect of rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   That accolade comes twice, actually. At another point, the Leon
version of Little Richard more accurately calls himself ``hotter
than fish grease in the summertime.''
</P>
<P>
   By way of biographical insight, the movie informs us that Little
Richard was from Macon, Ga., that his hard-nosed but loving father
(played by Carl Lumbly) was murdered, that Little Richard had a
girlfriend named Lucille (Tamala Jones) for a while, that he is
religious and that he adores pancake makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly these personal asides are like thin rye wrapped around
the movie's real innards _ the music. And around Leon's cutesy
performance as the eye-rolling, shoulder-shimmying purveyor of such
early rock classics as ``Tutti Frutti'' and ``Long Tall Sally.''
</P>
<P>
   I give director Robert Townsend (``The Five Heartbeats,''
``Hollywood Shuffle'') credit for putting a bright, brassy sheen on
the movie. It's lively and watchable, however empty. The music is
fun.
</P>
<P>
   The film's best few moments capture Leon and a Pat Boone
look-alike in separate recording sessions for ``Long Tall Sally.''
The scene, with Boone struggling through his cover version for his
well-scrubbed audience, could make a white man wince in
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Richard'' finds its epiphany in 1967 when the erstwhile
Richard Penniman is seen knocking an audience dead during an
Australian tour. Right in the middle of ``Long Tall Sally,'' he
spots a comet streaking across the sky and takes it as a sign from
God. He decides, right there, to chuck his brilliant singing career
to become a preacher.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooked in this pivotal scene, which leads the movie and is
repeated later, is the fact that by 1967, Little Richard was a rock
'n' roll relic.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that the executive producer of this movie didn't
choose to see himself as outdated. It's also possible that a movie
that would fudge on one fact might fudge on others.
</P>
<P>
   But as a program form, these bios keep rocking along. We've had
Elvis, the Beatles, the Jackson Five and the Temptations, and a
week from Sunday the overly familiar story of the Beach Boys hits
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   How long before some network coughs up a Bob Dylan biopic? And
will it have the honesty to call it ``It Ain't Me, Babe''?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``All the King's Men,'' a one-part film on ``Masterpiece
Theatre,'' is a British World War I story, not a remake of the
Robert Penn Warren novel. It's about an incident that Winston
Churchill once called ``without a doubt the greatest unsolved
mystery of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchill said that in 1919, so there were a few 20th century
mysteries to come. Such as: Why is ``Veronica's Closet'' still on
national television?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the mystery involves a company of volunteers raised from
the royal estate at Sandringham. In 1915, during the disastrous
Gallipoli campaign in Turkey, the company vanished on the
battlefield. There were reports that the soldiers had been swept up
into a strange mist.
</P>
<P>
   That seems a poor explanation, scientifically speaking, although
I have known a few people to disappear into strange clouds. This
BBC movie is based on a book by its co-producer, Nigel McCrery, and
purports to solve the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   I won't spoil the movie, but the answer isn't pretty. And it
doesn't take the movie where a casual viewer might expect it to go.
It seems as if we're just settling in with these guys and then,
(set ital)poof.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   David Jason, a popular comic actor in Britain, is utterly
convincing as the squat, middle-aged Capt. Frank Beck, who turned a
company of grooms and gardeners into soldiers and then led them
into battle.
</P>
<P>
   For American viewers, the more familiar co-star is Maggie Smith
as the compassionate Queen Alexandra, mother of the reigning King
George V (David Troughton). She encouraged and honored the dutiful
Beck and commissioned a quiet inquiry into what happened on the
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the King's Men'' becomes a bit disjointed in its second
half, but it's still a smartly entertaining, and beautifully
photographed, trek to two worlds _ Sandringham and Gallipoli _ that
contrast with each other as idyllic and gruesomely terrible.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote at the end of the movie reminds viewers that of more
than a million men from the British Empire who were killed in World
War I, half have no known graves.

BANKING INQUIRY'S TANGLED WEB REACHES LOFTY LEVELS IN MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: The 2nd Take is scheduled to move by 9:40 p.m. ET) 
(js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a city where banks sprout and die like mushrooms and
pseudo-banks are not uncommon, the money-moving network described
in a New York court on Wednesday in the fast-unfolding Bank of New
York case quickly branches into a tangled web of control and
ownership, some strands reaching to the highest levels of Russian
finance and government.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, neither Flamingo nor DKB _ the two Moscow banks
that figure prominently in the accounts of Lucy Edwards and Peter
Berlin, the banking couple whose guilty plea has opened a new
window on the case _ were really banks at all, according to Russian
bankers and U.S. investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they were front companies that allowed ingenious schemes
for funneling money out of Russia beneath the radar of customs and
tax officials, and into one of three accounts at the Bank of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Such specialty banks are a key element of the economic chaos
that resulted from the precipitous disintegration of the Soviet
system. The most rudimentary mechanisms and controls were absent as
Russians scrambled for the abandoned resources, the winners
emerging with huge holdings and fabulous fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these entities are called pocket banks, belonging to a
single company or industry that needs a special line of credit.
Others are political banks, born of the embrace between Russian
business and government that has given new meaning to crony
capitalism. And sorting out which is which and who owns what is an
accountant's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, according to documents filed Wednesday in New
York, both Flamingo and DKB (the Russian initials for Deposit
Clearing Bank) were the children of two Russian banks, MDM and
Sobinbank, both of which have enjoyed the backing of well-connected
patrons in Moscow, some with close ties to the Kremlin, others
linked to the Moscow City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Sobinbank was no phony institution. Founded in 1990, it had a
lobby and customers and had been put together by a collection of
larger, powerful Russian banks, including SBS Agro, a bank headed
by Alexander Smolensky, who had ties to Boris Berezovksy, Russia's
master political intriguer, financier and media mogul.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether those powerful patrons invented, used or
even knew of the elaborate money transfer schemes used to move $7
billion through the Bank of New York accounts controlled by Berlin
_ Benex, BECS and Lowland. Much of the money that moved through
them belonged to Russian importers looking for ways to pay foreign
suppliers without alerting Russian authorities to the real value of
their contracts. But there is also evidence that the same schemes
were used by criminals to launder money, and by rich Russians to
park their profits overseas, in off-shore banking havens.
</P>
<P>
   According to observers here, the more Edwards, the former Bank
of New York vice president, and her husband, Berlin, cooperate with
federal authorities, the more nervous many of Russia's top bankers
are likely to become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certain that if these two continue to talk, they will be
able to say a lot about illegal activities, the participants in
which would include well known financiers and public figures,''
said Yuri Skuratov, Russia's former prosecutor general, whose
ouster last winter by the Kremlin set off a successive wave of
financial scandals here that culminated last August when the
federal investigation of the Bank of New York became publicly
known.
</P>
<P>
   But sorting out the facts in the chaos of Soviet banking is a
formidable task, if not impossible. With lax reporting standards,
weak laws and a high mortality rate among banks _ if not bankers _
paper trails meander through tangles of shifting owners, and
sometimes disappear.

POSSIBLE NEW TREATMENT FOUND FOR SERIOUS LIVER DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A possible new approach to treating cirrhosis of the liver, the
seventh-leading cause of death in the world, has emerged from
studies of telomerase, a recently discovered agent that
indefinitely prolongs the life of human cells grown in the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   So far the treatment has worked only in mice that have
artificially been given cirrhosis. If it works in people, too, it
would offer a new way of tackling a major, intractable disease, as
well as of averting liver cancer, the leading cause of cancer cases
worldwide, 80 percent of which originate from liver cirrhosis.
</P>
<P>
   The research is the work of Dr. Ronald A. DePinho, a mouse
geneticist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and colleagues, and
is reported in Friday's issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irwin A. Arias, a liver expert at Tufts University, said
that the work was ``brilliant'' but that any treatment was ``a
long, long way off.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirrhosis is the scarring of the liver that results when toxins
like alcohol or hepatitis viruses B and C kill the liver cells and
exhaust the organ's usual capacity to regenerate itself. The
scarring blocks blood flow and the liver's ability to function
properly, leading to symptoms that can be postponed but not
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanism by which the various liver toxins cause cirrhosis
is unknown, but Japanese scientists recently noticed that liver
cells from cirrhosis patients had an anomaly in their chromosomes,
the giant DNA molecules in which the cell's programming
instructions are encoded. Specifically, the end sections of the
chromosomes, known as the telomeres, were unusually short. Each
time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter, as if counting off
some permissible number of divisions, until at a certain minimum
telomere length the cell is thrown into crisis and dies.
</P>
<P>
   Telomeres are kept long in egg and sperm cells by the enzyme
telomerase. But the telomerase gene is suppressed in most normal
cells, and as people age, their telomeres decrease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists supported by Geron Corp. of Menlo Park, Calif.,
discovered recently that human cells grown in glassware could be
made to divide indefinitely _ becoming in principle immortal _ if
given an active copy of the telomerase gene that builds their
telomeres back to youthful length.
</P>
<P>
   Telomeres in general do not seem to place a limit on human life
span. Their purpose seems to be as a last-ditch defense against
tumors, zapping malignant cells after they have reached their
quotas of divisions.
</P>
<P>
   But some biologists believe short telomeres may be a drawback in
diseases where a cell type is forced to divide unusually often.
When DePinho heard of the Japanese finding of short telomeres in
cirrhosis, he decided to test the idea in mice by seeing if
insertion of the telomerase gene into liver cells could prevent the
development of cirrhosis.
</P>
<P>
   Mice have very long telomeres, so to obtain animals with
telomeres as short as those of elderly people, he took a strain
that lacked the telomerase gene altogether and bred the mice
through several generations.
</P>
<P>
   Cirrhosis was induced in the short-telomere mice by injecting
them with a liver-poisoning chemical. In addition, one group of
mice was injected with a virus carrying a copy of the mouse
telomerase gene. In these mice, development of cirrhosis was
blocked, presumably because the telomerase rescued certain
short-telomere cells from crisis, enabling them to regenerate the
liver.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this finding, DePinho and colleagues conclude, ``It
is reasonable to anticipate that activation of telomerase could
inhibit the development of liver cirrhosis or terminal liver
failure in humans.''
</P>
<P>
   If the telomere-shortening system protects against cancer, an
artificial lengthening of the telomeres might raise a cancer risk.
In their article, the authors suggest the telomerase treatment
could be tested in patients awaiting a liver transplant, since the
liver was due for removal anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Calvin Harley, scientific director of Geron, the company
developing telomerase-based therapies, said DePinho's work was ``a
pretty important first step in establishing that telomere loss can
be the trigger of chronic disease.'' Geron has also been working on
telomere-based treatments for cirrhosis, but any clinical tests of
a treatment are ``certainly not less than two years away,'' Harley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arias, the Tufts liver expert, interpreted DePinho's work more
cautiously, saying it was too early even to be sure that short
telomeres were the trigger for cirrhosis. Because many questions
remain about the timing of telomere shortening and the types of
cirrhosis in which shortening occurs, ``It is not a good idea to
speculate about the therapeutic aspects or suggest that a clinical
trial can be done instantly,'' Arias said.
</P>
<P>
   DePinho inserted the telomerase gene into mice by piggy-backing
it onto a disabled adenovirus, one of the causes of the common
cold. Though the virus itself is considered pretty harmless, its
use in gene therapy has fallen under a cloud after the death of
Jesse Gelsinger, a patient being treated for a rare metabolic
disease at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   DePinho and Harley said there were many other methods besides
adenovirus for delivering both the telomerase gene and the
telomerase protein itself.
</P>
<P>
   Besides cirrhosis, several other diseases are thought, though
not yet proved, to be caused by telomere shortening and the
depletion of critical cell types. They include AIDS, ulcerative
colitis and various skin and immune-system disorders.
</P>
<P>
   In another report in Science, a team of Japanese and American
scientists describe a method for growing enough liver cells in
glassware to regenerate the organ when the cells are injected back
into rats. The method depends on first infecting the cells with a
tumor gene that makes them divide. The tumor gene can be completely
excised from the cells after they have divided.

ANALYSIS: GREENSPAN IS TUNED OUT BY TECHNOLOGY INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>
   (See also FED-GREENSPAN) 
(rk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Alan Greenspan speaks, the old economy trembles. But the
new one thinks it is impervious to higher interest rates, and
shrugs off warnings from the Fed chairman.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the pattern since the Fed began to raise interest
rates last summer, and it continued Thursday. Greenspan's stark
warnings that short-term interest rates will continue to rise had
only a brief impact on the Nasdaq composite index, which is
dominated by high-technology companies that are benefiting from the
digital revolution.
</P>
<P>
   That index then shot up 121.27 points, or 2.7 percent, to a new
high of 4,548.92, as the Nasdaq market traded 2 billion shares for
the first time. The index is up 69 percent since June 30, the date
of the first of the Fed's four rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   But the story was different for the Dow Jones industrial
average, which is far more dependent on stocks that are liable to
be hurt as higher interest rates slow the economy. It fell 100
points within minutes after the Fed chairman began testifying;
while it recovered some of that, it ended down 46.84 points, or
almost half a percentage point, at 10,514.57. It is down about 4
percent since June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus reaction on Wall Street seemed to be that little
was new in the chairman's testimony. ``Maybe he's raised his own
estimate'' of how high interest rates have to go to slow the
economy, said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith
Barney. ``But he didn't say we needed to get there faster.''
</P>
<P>
   For some time the fixed-income markets have been expecting at
least two more increases in short-term rates by the Fed, with the
first one, of at least a quarter percentage point, expected next
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chairman's comments did not trigger any massive
re-evaluation of where the Fed is going,'' said Louis Crandall, the
chief economist of Wrightson Associates, a bond market research
firm. ``If anything, it may have made people a little more
nervous'' that the next increase might be a half percentage point,
rather than the quarter-point raise seen in the previous increases.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term interest rates rose moderately Thursday, though it
was unclear how much of that was caused by Greenspan's remarks and
how much by other factors, including a report by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia that indicated rising price pressures
for manufacturing companies.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Greenspan noted the willingness of many stock
investors to shrug off the risk of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, rising business earnings expectations and declining
compensation for risk have more than offset'' the impact of higher
rates, he said. But he forecast that, at some point, rates would
rise enough to have an impact on the expectations of stock market
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan seems dead set on taking the punch bowl from the
party,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief equity strategist at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``The market is understanding that
interest rates will continue to head higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig &AMP; Co., agreed.
Greenspan, he said, ``is committed to ending, for a time, outsized
gains for the equity market.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks, however, do not stop going up just because interest
rates rise. They stop going up because investors stop bidding them
up. So far, it appears, higher interest rates have alarmed
investors in many industries. General Electric, Coca-Cola and
Citigroup were among the Dow stocks that fell by at least a dollar
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But those losses were partly offset by gains in Microsoft, Intel
and IBM. Technology stock investors are not worried about higher
interest rates, and Wednesday's forceful testimony from Greenspan
did not change that.

   Such specialty banks are a key element of the economic chaos
that resulted from the precipitous disintegration of the Soviet
system. The most rudimentary mechanisms and controls were absent as
Russians scrambled for the abandoned resources, the winners
emerging with huge holdings and fabulous fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these entities are called pocket banks, belonging to a
single company or industry that needs a special line of credit.
Others are political banks, born of the embrace between Russian
business and government that has given new meaning to crony
capitalism. And sorting out which is which and who owns what is an
accountant's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, according to documents filed Wednesday in New
York, both Flamingo and DKB (the Russian initials for Deposit
Clearing Bank) were the children of two Russian banks, MDM and
Sobinbank, both of which have enjoyed the backing of well-connected
patrons in Moscow, some with close ties to the Kremlin, others
linked to the Moscow City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Sobinbank was no phony institution. Founded in 1990, it had a
lobby and customers and had been put together by a collection of
larger, powerful Russian banks, including SBS Agro, a bank headed
by Alexander Smolensky, who had ties to Boris Berezovksy, Russia's
master political intriguer, financier and media mogul.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether those powerful patrons invented, used or
even knew of the elaborate money transfer schemes used to move $7
billion through the Bank of New York accounts controlled by Berlin
_ Benex, BECS and Lowland. Much of the money that moved through
them belonged to Russian importers looking for ways to pay foreign
suppliers without alerting Russian authorities to the real value of
their contracts. But there is also evidence that the same schemes
were used by criminals to launder money, and by rich Russians to
park their profits overseas, in off-shore banking havens.
</P>
<P>
   According to observers here, the more Edwards, the former Bank
of New York vice president, and her husband, Berlin, cooperate with
federal authorities, the more nervous many of Russia's top bankers
are likely to become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certain that if these two continue to talk, they will be
able to say a lot about illegal activities, the participants in
which would include well known financiers and public figures,''
said Yuri Skuratov, Russia's former prosecutor general, whose
ouster last winter by the Kremlin set off a successive wave of
financial scandals here that culminated last August when the
federal investigation of the Bank of New York became publicly
known.
</P>
<P>
   But sorting out the facts in the chaos of Soviet banking is a
formidable task, if not impossible. With lax reporting standards,
weak laws and a high mortality rate among banks _ if not bankers _
paper trails meander through tangles of shifting owners, and
sometimes disappear.

MICROSOCT LAUNCHES HIGH-STAKES WINDOWS 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Microsoft partied as it unveiled its new Windows 2000
operating system in San Francisco Thursday, accompanied by rock
stars and an actor, cheering fans and a 40-foot high mock laptop
with keys the size of stepping stones.
</P>
<P>
   But chairman Bill Gates only rarely cracked a smile as the
hoopla reached its pitch, a telling reminder that this is the
product upon which the company has risked its future.
</P>
<P>
   With $2 billion development costs and 35 million lines of code,
Windows 2000 is the product that Microsoft hopes will allow it to
continue its dominance in the worldwide software market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we unveil the future of computing,'' said Gates, flanked
by Star Trek actor Patrick Stewart and rock's Carlos Santana and
his band at a conference staged by the company to introduce the
software upgrade. ``We're so excited that this will become the
standard on the business desktops.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the product has drawn positive reviews from several
Seattle-area companies that have been previewing the
business-oriented operating system designed to replace Windows NT
4.0. It is a solid product that boosts performance and stability on
both desktop PCs and servers, they say.
</P>
<P>
   But others, leery of major new software because it is often
flawed, say they'll hold off for six months or more until problems
that may emerge have been cured. One of those is the city of
Medina, the wealthy community where Gates lives.
</P>
<P>
   Gates predicted that Windows 2000 would be on every desktop PC,
but didn't predict the same for servers, the souped-up PCs that run
many corporations' e-mail, accounting and personnel systems.
Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer admitted that delays in
Windows 2000 _ it was initially expected to debut in early to
mid-1999 _ have given Microsoft's competitors, including Novell's
NetWare and the grassroots Linux operating system, an opportunity
to gain converts in the server marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But Windows 2000, he said, will bring customers back.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 Professional Desktop version costs $319 for new
users, $219 for upgrades from Windows 95 and 98, and $149 for
upgrades from Windows NT. The Server version sells for $959 for
five users. Advanced Server, which supports larger, multi-processor
servers, lists for $3,999 for 25 users.
</P>
<P>
   By this summer, Microsoft is also slated to ship Data Center
Server, an as-yet unpriced version for sites that run the massive
databases needed by e-commerce Web sites and Internet service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers that have used the product have been incredibly
happy, so I'm feeling that we're doing what we hoped to do,''
Ballmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer gurus at three Seattle-area companies said they were
indeed happy with Windows 2000, though each also had some
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Husting, co-founder and chief technology officer of
online real estate company eHome, said upgrading will help the
18-month-old company list and sell homes over the Internet in three
new cities a month over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the national expansion effort that brought eHome into
Seattle earlier this month, eHome upgraded all 80 of its desktop
PCs from Windows 95 or 98 and all 21 of its servers from Windows
NT, including those in Bellevue that host its Web site. It has also
upgraded all 30 of its laptops to Windows 2000 from Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Husting said the upgrades are worthwhile in large part because
the desktop and server versions contain built-in remote-management
software that had to be purchased and used separately under earlier
versions of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   With no such add-ins, Windows 2000 will allow him to easily add
antivirus updates to every company PC from a central location
automatically when each user logs onto the network. He expects
these capabilities will likely help cut back travel time and
expense as the company's PC count expands to 1,500 by the end of
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Plug and Play, which is built into Windows 95, 98 and Windows
2000 but was missing from Windows NT, saves Husting and his staff
``many hours of aggravation'' he said. Without it, every time a
CD-ROM drive, printer, or digital camera is added to a machine, it
must be rebooted. With it, no reboot is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Curry, local-area network manager for the Seattle Mariners,
upgraded the 15 Compaq Proliant servers that power the Mariners'
accounting system, e-mail, file- and print-sharing, and sales from
stores and kiosks in the stadium. He also upgraded about 150 PCs
from Windows 95, 98 or NT starting in December, completing the task
just last week.
</P>
<P>
   Built-in administrative tools and printer support have
eliminated the need to use some third-party software, like a
port-configuration utility formerly required for printing, Curry
said. He said he especially appreciates that in the Server edition,
a built-in terminal utility lets him call in from home to monitor
machines, add or delete users, and make other changes that had
required coming onsite.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone demonstrated the terminal services, I instantly
knew we had to upgrade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Sullivan, director of information services at InfoSpace in
Redmond, said he normally wouldn't use a product that's ``just out
the door like this, but a lot of the feedback is that it's
substantially better than any previous release, and we see our
ability to respond quickly as depending on keeping abreast of the
newest technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 is already up and running on the 150 servers that
make up the bulk of InfoSpace's mission-critical Web server farm,
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Providing more than 500 million page views per month, the
company is heavily dependent on its servers to supply Yellow Pages,
White Pages, stock quotes, and other information to thousands of
other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrade from Windows NT went smoothly, though some changes
to scripts and home-grown applications were required, Sullivan
said. Windows 2000 allows the possibility of expanding from dual-
and four-processor machines to eight-processor machines, which
Sullivan said might be required as the company grows.
</P>
<P>
   When the occasional failure does occur, or a server just needs
to be brought down for maintenance, Windows 2000 takes half the
time to reboot as did Windows NT, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   InfoSpace has also upgraded about half its pool of roughly 75
laptops and 150 desktops to Windows 2000. Windows NT was widely
acknowledged to be far less than ideal for laptops, and Sullivan
said Windows 2000 offers much better reliability and stability.
</P>
<P>
   It also offers greater security than Windows 98, which many
people put onto laptops to avoid NT's shortcomings there. Now, a
lost or stolen laptop is useless without a valid ID and password.
</P>
<P>
   But other Seattle-area technology experts said that for now,
they'll take a pass on Microsoft's newest software.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carney, senior vice president of information systems at
Costco wholesale, said, ``We're concerned at this point (with) any
debugging that might have to be done. Some bugs are normal with any
new product.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said there is no clear cost justification for upgrading
the company's 3,000 PCs and 200 Windows-based servers at this
point.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Medina city manager Doug Schulze said ``cost is part
of the reason we're not converting now.'' A recent hardware and
software upgrade program, he said, has stretched the information
systems department's financial resources.
</P>
<P>
   Don Eagon, whose Lynnwood-based Accunet Computer Services
provides network management services to Medina, added, ``Windows 98
is a great operating system, with all the glitches worked out. Why
spend money when you don't have to, especially when it's glitchy?''
</P>
<P>
   Though the launch of Windows 2000 was announced several months
ago, it caused Microsoft stock to climb $2, to $99.63. Shares
continued to trend up in after-hours trading, touching $100.75.

 CHARLESTON, S.C.: a favor.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Bush, his surrogates and interest groups have also tried to
appeal to conservatives in the party. He has steadfastly refused to
nudge South Carolinians in any direction in their debate over the
Confederate battle flag at the state house. And two weeks ago, he
spoke to students at Bob Jones University, a conservative Christian
school that bans interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at the news conference whether voters might reach the
conclusion that he was not an ardent foe of racial intolerance, the
governor grew tense and visibly angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you judge my heart based upon giving a speech at a
university,'' he admonished reporters. Then noted that former
Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, his father, had also
visited the university.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was not sure whether he had been informed about the
dating policy before he spoke at the school, but insisted he did
not regret his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also aware of the power of religious conservatives,
and his aides tried to deflect accusations from Bush supporters
that McCain was not reliable on abortion and other social issues.
</P>
<P>
   But there was at least one sign on Wednesday night that Bauer's
support would not fully insulate McCain from the religious right.
James C. Dobson, a prominent Christian conservative who has been
close to Bauer over the years, released a statement that took issue
with the endorsement and expressed harsh criticism of McCain over
his votes to confirm what Dobson called ``pro-abortion'' Supreme
Court justices.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson, who has not endorsed anyone in the race, added: ``McCain
has accepted huge contributions from the gambling industry and
apparently is comfortable with the proliferation of gambling in
American society. He has also accepted large contributions from
producers of alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bauer seemed aware that his endorsement of
McCain would not be greeted with great enthusiasm by allies in the
religious right. At one point, he said in a phone call to his
friend William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, ``Did I
mention to you if this doesn't work out, my family and I will be
living in your house?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain hailed Bauer throughout the day as a man of courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, the best thing and smartest thing for Gary Bauer
to do in this campaign was stay out of it,'' he told the audience
in the outdoor Wyche Pavilion here. ``Now you tell me,'' Bauer
murmured.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Johnson, a senior official of the National Right to Life
Committee, said on Thursday he did not think the endorsement would
change the minds of many conservative voters. ``Gary Bauer was not
attracting many pro-life voters in his own right,'' Johnson said,
``and we don't think he's going to be able to rehabilitate John
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain began his morning at a breakfast at a Spartanburg VFW
post and later attended two rallies with rock music and confetti
shot into the air.
</P>
<P>
   One of the events at times resembled a revival meeting, as an
announcer called out the names of voters who had become recent
converts to McCain. As music boomed, the senator's wife Cindy
danced on an outdoor stage. Voters thrust copies of McCain's
autobiography at him to sign.
</P>
<P>
   One of the voters gazing up at McCain from the front of the
crowd was Diane Underwood, a nurse who had welcomed him and other
prisoners of war home from Vietnam at Clark Air Force base in the
Phillipines in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   She said she remembered how the returning prisoners of war asked
for things they craved, like a favorite food. McCain, she recalled,
``wanted books and newspapers and magazines, so that he could see
what went on while he was in captivity.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's time as a prisoner also came up on the bus
Thursday afternoon when reporters asked him about an article in The
Nation magazine reporting that he had referred to his Vietnamese
captors as ``gooks'' while on his campaign bus in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll call right now my interrogator that tortured me and my
friends a gook,'' said McCain who was a prisoner for
five-and-a-half years. ``You can quote me.''
</P>
<P>
   He called his guards ``cruel and sadistic people'' and said ``I
will continue to refer to them in language that might offend some
people here, because of their beating and killing and torture of my
friends. I hated the gooks and I will hate them as long as I
live.''

MINIMAL RESEARCH PREPARED ON AOL-TIME WARNER DEAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts spend a lot of time talking about how
companies in industries from retailing to telecommunications had
better prepare for the changes the Internet will bring in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   But they are having a hard time living up to their own rhetoric
when it comes to the pending merger of America Online with Time
Warner Inc. The $120 billion deal, which marks the biggest
combination ever of a major Internet company with a traditional
company, has gone largely uncovered by analysts at major securities
firms like Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost six weeks after AOL and Time Warner announced their
combination, the major firms have failed to produce a comprehensive
look at the combined company's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the merger say the paucity of research is at least
part of the reason America Online's stock has lost nearly a third
of its value since the combination was announced on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   While skeptical investors play down the usefulness of research
by industry analysts, strong research provides both support for a
company's stock and a set of benchmarks against its performance can
be judged. The issue is especially important for the combined AOL
Time Warner, which will have no obvious peers and which will be a
very complex company.
</P>
<P>
   Neither AOL nor Time Warner would discuss the issue publicly,
presumably for fear of alienating the analysts who follow them. But
privately, sources close to the companies said that the lack of
research is frustrating. ``Right now, Wall Street is not moving at
Internet speed,'' a person close to the deal said.
</P>
<P>
   John Schreiber, who follows Time Warner for Janus Capital, the
Denver-based mutual fund company that is Time Warner's largest
institutional shareholder, was less reticent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a situation where you have very established
traditional media analysts, and very established new media
analysts,'' he said. ``Now, all of a sudden, you put these two
companies together, and it becomes a contest to see who has the
most clout within the firm. It's unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   At Merrill Lynch, Jessica Reif said she plans to cover the
combined AOL Time Warner jointly with Henry Blodget, the Internet
analyst. She declined to comment on when she plans to release
research on the combination.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said the firm could
not offer research on the deal because it had advised Time Warner
on the merger and was in a quiet period. Goldman, Sachs did not
return phone calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner and AOL have traditionally been valued very
differently. Analysts generally value Time Warner, like most other
entertainment companies, based on its cash flow. (Cash flow
includes earnings before taxes, interest charges and some noncash
expenses.)
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say they like the measure because it enables them to
compare the performance of companies with different levels of debt
and amortization charges. Cynics note that using cash flow makes
companies with weak earnings and relatively high prices look less
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, analysts who follow AOL, which is extremely expensive
by any traditional valuation, prefer to value it based on
``metrics'' such as subscriber growth. And while analysts can
compare the performance and valuation of Time Warner with that of
other entertainment companies relatively easily, AOL essentially
stands alone in its business model, making a valuation more an art
than a science.
</P>
<P>
   Meshing those world views has proved to be a slow process, said
Jeffrey Logsdon, managing director of the Seidler Companies, a
regional invesment bank in Los Angeles. ``Most of the media
analysts do not want to become Internet analysts,'' Logsdon said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolzien, a stock analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who is one
of the few people to cover both companies, agreed. ``There's a real
difficult time with the Street by and large coming to grips with
the combination,'' Wolzien said. ``In a lot of the houses, you just
don't even know who's going to cover the combined company.''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, neither AOL nor Time Warner is easy to
understand at first glance, Wolzien said. AOL gets revenue from
subscriptions, advertising and Internet commerce, and is rapidly
expanding internationally. Time Warner has five major divisions,
each with its own business cycle.

   GIRDWOOD, Alaska _ One moment all was quiet, and the Chugach
Range stood out in the snowcapped splendor of a timeless winter
scene. The next, recalled Keith Burton, a track-repair man for the
Alaska Railroad, ``it was like a huge billowy cloud just jumped
right off the mountains and started rolling straight down toward
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The few seconds that Burton had to grab his radio and shout
``Avalanche!'' were not enough for another worker, Kerry Brookman,
who was operating a bulldozer to clear snow from the tracks that
run south from Anchorage along the Turnagain Arm, a waterway that
flows toward the Kenai Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The moving wall of snow slammed straight into the 38,000-pound
bulldozer, sweeping man and machine nearly 200 yards, out onto the
frozen mud flats of the Arm. The crumpled dozer landed upside down,
its tracks in the air, and although his frantic co-workers managed
to find Brookman still conscious _ ``I'm OK, I'll be all right,''
he said _ he died of internal trauma soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of at least 33 major avalanches that have struck
south-central Alaska in recent weeks, a cycle of fury and danger
that, even by the standards of a state where awesome natural power
is continually on display, has been extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   The massive slides, two of which have been a mile wide, are a
product of an unusual weather pattern of thawing and freezing that
created virtual shelves of ice on mountaintops earlier this winter.
By late January, extremely heavy snowfalls were accumulating on
those glacial shelves, creating conditions for what one state
expert describes as ``hundred-year avalanches.''
</P>
<P>
   Two have proved deadly _ the one that killed Brookman, 53, on
Feb. 1 and one on Jan. 26 that struck just outside the town of
Cordova on Prince William Sound, flattening several homes and
warehouses and killing Martha Quales, 63.
</P>
<P>
   Several others have played havoc, blocking the Seward Highway,
the link between Anchorage and all the towns on the Kenai
Peninsula, for five days earlier this month and cutting off
electricity to thousands of the peninsula's residents.
</P>
<P>
   Still other slides, far from much human habitation, have simply
been spectacular to behold, in either their occurrence or their
aftermath, the power unleashed akin to that of a volcano.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like nothing I've ever seen, short of visiting Mount St.
Helens,'' Dan Amyot, a ranger at Chugach State Park, said of an
early February avalanche near Eklutna Lake, north of Anchorage,
that snapped thousands of two-foot-thick aspens and cottonwoods and
created a mile-long field of debris near the base of 7,500-foot
Bold Peak. ``It's a whole forest laid down like toothpicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tony Knowles has declared the region a disaster area and
sought federal help. Property damage caused by the avalanches has
been estimated at more than $16 million so far, said Phil Oates,
adjutant general of the Alaska National Guard. And nervous state
officials say that depending on the weather over the next several
weeks, the problem could actually get worse as spring approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that we're not done yet,'' said John Horn, regional
director of the Alaska Department of Transportation. ``There are a
lot of slopes that haven't released any snow yet, and when the warm
spring sun hits, we're concerned there could be more problems.
There's just a whole lot of snow up there in the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   While some avalanches are predictable _ conditions in any number
of locations are frequently just right for them _ many others
strike without warning, quickly reaching speeds of 125 miles an
hour or more and leaving debris fields 200 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone here recognizes the continuing danger, especially on
the Seward Highway. The road runs for miles just beneath the
3,000-foot-high faces of several mountains in the Chugach Range,
which are all building up huge piles of snow and can, without
warning, shed them down their steep slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Even in less perilous times, the Seward Highway is among the
most avalanche-prone travel routes anywhere in the nation. It is so
susceptible to slides that the state sometimes tries, as at a
number of other locations, to let them loose before nature does,
with howitzers and with explosives that crews drop from planes and
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called avalanche control, which is a little presumptuous,
of course,'' said Bill Glude, a consultant to the state who is
director of the Southeast Alaska Avalanche Center. ``It's really an
attempt at mitigation. The bombs, if you drop them in the right
spot, provide enough of a shock load to trigger an avalanche.''
</P>
<P>
   Glude has been crisscrossing south-central Alaska in recent
weeks, helping state officials figure out where and when to set off
the explosives. Highways and railroad tracks are closed to traffic
when such work is done. Then the resulting snow and debris are
cleared, and the transportation corridors reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such work can stave off more snowy turmoil remains to be
seen. There is clearly a huge amount of snow around here, both up
in the mountains and even down below. Here in Girdwood, the plowed
snow rises in some places to the level of the street signs, and
walking through town can feel a bit like threading through a maze.
</P>
<P>
   After rains and a thawing period followed by the freeze, huge
amounts of snow started falling in January. Nearby Anchorage, which
normally gets about 9 inches of snow in January, recorded 34
inches, according to the National Weather Service. And even more
fell here in Girdwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to snow, but this was just incredible,'' said Todd
Hiibner, manager of World Cup, a store here that sells skiing
equipment. ``Even before the avalanches came, they had to close
down the Alyeska Ski Resort for a while. There was literally just
too much snow. You couldn't ski in it; you'd just sink in it to
your waist if you tried.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was so much snow one morning that Bob Mucha, owner of
Chugach Express, which operates dog-sled tours here in town, had to
dig his 40 Alaskan huskies out of their doghouses.
</P>
<P>
   Climate experts here can trace the unusual cycle to storms in
the Pacific but cannot say at this point whether it is related to
larger climatic factors like global warming. There is wide
agreement, though, that in the words of Mike Maillet, a maintenance
foreman for the Alaska Railroad, ``It's just been a strange year,
the thaws, the cold, then lots of snow.''
</P>
<P>
   And while avalanches kill people who venture into remote areas
nearly every year _ there were 11 such deaths across Alaska last
year, most involving snowmobilers _ the slides this year are
unusual for killing people in inhabited areas. In Cordova, Mayor Ed
Zeine said recently that the city would consider rezoning the area
where Quales was killed, to prevent new building there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were houses completely blown to smithereens, cars tipped
over, mature trees ripped out and thrown out onto the lake,'' Glude
said of the Cordova slide. ``It was really quite amazing. It was a
very graphic demonstration of the power of nature.''

<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ With only two days to go before a Republican
primary that seems too close to call, Gov. George W. Bush and
Senator John McCain raced across South Carolina on Thursday, with
Bush continuing a relentless attack on his opponent and McCain
making a broad appeal for the votes of Democrats, independents and
Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   The day offered a vivid reflection of the diverging strategies
of the main two Republican contenders, both of whom recognize that
turnout will be critical in Saturday's primary and that the outcome
could play a pivotal role in deciding the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   At several events on Thursday, Bush made a direct appeal to
conservatives, saying that McCain was continuing to run a negative
campaign and that prominent Democrats were encouraging their party
members _ who are allowed to vote in the Republican primary _ to
support McCain because he would be an easier opponent for a
Democratic nominee to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are supporting me in big numbers in South
Carolina,'' Bush told reporters. ``There's a real intensity about
it. I do hear some concern amongst Republicans that it's going to
be the Democrats who determine the outcome of the election here,
and they want to make sure that doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain seemed to be trying to sail above the brittle fight here,
barely mentioning his opponent by name.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign released a new advertisement that compares him to
Ronald Reagan, and McCain, ever mindful of the crossover vote that
helped produced his stunning victory in New Hampshire two weeks
ago, talked expansively about his desire for a Republican Party
that could attract independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Republican Party to some degree has lost its way,'' he said
to a veterans rally. ``I want it to be a reform party; I want it to
be an inclusive party. It's not about being a Republican and
Democrat. What it's really being about is the core principles and
ideals about less government, lower taxes and a strong national
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was also bombarding the state's talk radio stations
with calls. In the morning and afternoon, McCain sat in the back of
his bus telephoning drive-time hosts, while Gary Bauer, a former
presidential rival who appealed to Christian conservatives, made
his own cell-phone calls to different stations from the front of
the bus.
</P>
<P>
   In a new touch, the McCain bus now has its Web address, which is
McCain2000.com, emblazoned on its roof, a move the campaign made
after the Today Show used helicopters to help in its interview of
McCain from the bus.
</P>
<P>
   McCain tangled with Bush over a flier that also became an issue
in their debate earlier in the week. At the beginning of a news
conference in Florence on Thursday morning, without any prompting,
Bush charged that McCain was still distributing the flier, which
contradicted both the senator's positive-campaign pledge last week
and his statements during a debate on Tuesday that his campaign was
not disseminating the document.
</P>
<P>
   The flier asserted that Bush wanted to nationalize education and
that his tax cut plan would squander the federal surplus so that
there was not ``one red cent'' left to shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing factual about this,'' Bush complained. ``The
senator has got to understand that he can't have it both ways. He
can't take the high horse and then claim the low road.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's education plan calls for more intensive federal
monitoring of schools and programs that get federal money, but he
talks often about keeping public education a local prerogative. And
the surplus issue is a matter of much debate, based on what pools
of money are being considered.
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded that the flier did not constitute a negative
attack on Bush because it told the truth. ``The flier is
accurate,'' he said. ``It's totally accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   He also tried to explain why he had disavowed involvement with
the flier during the debate. ``I obviously mistakenly took his word
for it that it was a negative piece of information,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush traveled from Florence to Myrtle Beach and on to
Charleston, his continued assertions that the senator's actions did
not match his words appeared to be an explicit attempt to tarnish
the image McCain's supporters have worked hard to promote: that he
is a hero and crusader with unusual integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was perhaps aimed at those independents who could
easily tip the race in one direction or another. But for
Republicans, Bush had another message: that he was their best
chance at winning back the White House, an argument that has been
at the core of his campaign from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent polls suggest that this may not be the case. But
Bush repeatedly insisted, as he has all week long, that Democrats
prepared to vote for McCain in the primaries here on Feb. 19 and in
Michigan on Feb. 22 were simply trying to do Gore a favor.

SHOCK OF KOSOVO VIOLENCE MAY PROVE INCENTIVE FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ The explosion of violence in and around
this northern town during the past two weeks, which left 11 dead
and dozens wounded, may not prove so much a disaster for Kosovo as
an event that shocks and galvanizes society, leaders here are
saying.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate result has been to bring hundreds more
peacekeeping troops to the streets of Mitrovica, to enforce a
curfew with foot patrols, and post armored vehicles at almost every
junction.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Kosovo peacekeeping force, Gen. Klaus
Reinhardt of Germany, has increased the troop presence fourfold.
``Whereas we had one battalion, now we have elements of up to about
four battalions in the city,'' he said in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt's plan for the past few months has been to make the
peacekeeping force in Mitrovica and elsewhere more multinational to
prevent the local communities from accusing the peacekeepers of
bias. French troops in Mitrovica have particularly come under heavy
criticism by both Serbs and ethnic Albanians. Already, more diverse
troops can be seen as they patrol the streets, searching houses and
vehicles for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically we are absolutely on track,'' Reinhardt said. ``I do
not see this as any turning point in our basic policy, which I see
as absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   But as more troops took to the streets, Yugoslavia's president,
Slobodan Milosevic, lashed out at the U.N.-led effort, saying the
peacekeepers should leave immediately, according to Reuters.
Milosevic denounced the U.N. mission in the southern Serbian
province as shameful and a total fiasco and said it should be ended
as soon as possible.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic lost control of the province, seen as a cradle of
Serbian culture, with the arrival of NATO-led peacekeepers last
June following 11 weeks of air strikes to halt Belgrade's
repression of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   If the recent violence in Mitrovica has proved a setback for the
NATO-led peacekeepers and U.N. administration, it has not produced
a change of heart. The general described his soldiers, who came
under the heaviest fire on Sunday in all their eight months of
peacekeeping, as ``really shocked.'' But he refused to blame anyone
but a ``stupid fool'' who opened fire and sparked a fire fight all
over the city.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the tension and bloodshed these past two weeks in
Kosovo has forced the leaders, both local and international, closer
together. Reinhardt worked closely with the local Albanian
commander of the Kosovo Protection Corps, Rahman Rama, a former
guerrilla commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, to contain the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. special representative in Kosovo, Dr. Bernard Kouchner,
said he has seen local leaders such as Hashim Thaci, the former
political leader of the KLA, and Ibrahim Rugova of the Democratic
League for Kosovo, suddenly start to emerge as responsible
political leaders. He praised Thaci in particular for traveling to
Mitrovica to plead for calm. Reinhardt said both leaders were
visibly shocked by the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the violence, Kouchner has taken the
offensive in calling on the international community to live up to
its pledges of money, aid and personnel. He attacked his own
government, France, for not supplying enough policemen, and has
turned the criticisms of U.N. failures onto the countries that have
failed to provide his mission with the necessary resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``My appeal is to the international community, they must see
that they have to back us, that for all those who say we have
failed to protect the minorities here, we will never give up. If
this is a turning point, then we will turn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus here is that to calm Mitrovica and recoup the
confidence lost in the past few weeks more soldiers, policemen and
resources will be needed. As part of the overall effort, Kouchner,
the U.N. representative, is sending 100 U.N. administrative staff
members to reinforce the fledgling administration in the north. He
is also bringing in international judges in hopes of effectively
enforcing the law.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Morcone, an Italian city prefect who is running the U.N.
administration in Mitrovica, stresses that to reduce the ethnic
tensions the city needs jobs, and joint employment projects.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. mission throughout Kosovo is short of money. But the
shortcomings are particularly noticeable in Mitrovica, which lacks
policemen, a working judiciary and stable businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the international community cannot give us enough to pay
people's pensions, then Mr. Milosevic will,'' warned Kouchner, who
had to cut short a fund-raising trip to Japan and Europe when the
violence in Mitrovica erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The partition of Mitrovica, with Serbs in the north, and
Albanians south of the river Ibar, is now on the U.N. agenda,
officials say. They talk of giving the city a special status,
creating an open city for residents only, who, without outsiders
aggravating tensions, could find a way to live and work together.
</P>
<P>
   The local leaders, Serb and Albanian, meanwhile blame each
other, but there is no doubt that the Albanians are more flexible.
Bajram Rexhepi, the Albanian mayor of Mitrovica, has a list of
ideas to improve the situation, many of which the peacekeepers and
the United Nations are already trying to implement. And because the
Serbs and Albanians have broken off all dialogue, Rexhepi even
offered to give up his position in favor of a U.N. administrator
who could rule by decree.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Ivanovic, the leader of the Serb National Council,
dismissed that idea immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we must stop the violence,'' he said, adding that if
Rexhepi ``has the power, I expect him to stop the Albanian
terrorists.'' Yet for his part, Ivanovic says he cannot control the
Serbs who attack ethnic Albanians, saying it is too dangerous for
him to take the side of Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the talk, the first signs of any return to normalcy
have yet to be seen. Claire Bourgeois, who heads the office of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Mitrovica, is just hoping
for signs of freedom of movement, one of the basic tenets of the
peacekeeping mission that never really existed in Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is most important,'' she said. ``We need to increase
freedom of movement for people stuck in their apartments. Good
security should be provided but also a consensus from the local
communities that this should be allowed.''

HOSPITAL IS TOLD NEUROSURGEON CAN'T OPERATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The death of a patient has prompted the state to
order Staten Island University Hospital to stop its chief of
neurosurgery from treating other patients, five years after the
same doctor was fired from another hospital for operating on the
wrong side of a patient's brain, a Health Department spokeswoman
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinarily strongly worded letter to the hospital's
chief executive, the deputy health commissioner, Dennis P. Whalen,
said the state had received information of a ``potentially grave
risk to patients.'' He said there was ``an immediate and serious
threat to the health of any person subjected to surgery'' performed
by the doctor, Ehud Arbit, and directed the hospital to force him
to stop practicing medicine there, pending the outcome of its
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials would not comment Thursday night. State
officials would not specify the nature or extent of the
investigation at the hospital. A state Health Department
spokeswoman, Kristine Smith, said a patient, whom she would not
identify, died following brain surgery performed by Arbit earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1995 case, at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in
New York, Arbit's patient survived.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit did not return calls to his office about the state's new
action. A woman who answered the phone there said, ``This all has
nothing to do with Dr. Arbit.''
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Barbara Ryan, said that she could not comment on the
state's actions. ``The cases under review are subject to patient
confidentiality laws,'' Ryan said. ``There are not any allegations
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``There is no cause for concern for any of the care
or treatment that this doctor has rendered.''
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department last investigated Arbit beginning in 1995,
when he was chief of neurosurgery at Memorial-Sloan Kettering. He
mistakenly operated on the healthy right side of the brain of
Rajeswari Ayyappan, the mother of a famous Indian film star,
Sridevi Ayyappan, instead of the left side, where a cancerous tumor
was situated, health officials said. The error left the patient
with little memory and unable to recognize family members.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department rebuked the hospital and fined it $16,000,
the maximum amount permitted, for eight violations of regulations
on health care that it said contributed to the error. The state
decided that Arbit's actions warranted a one-year probation, which
allowed him to continue practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   It is common for doctors who have been dismissed from one
hospital, even when they have been disciplined by the state as
well, to gain work at other health care centers. Even in cases
where doctors lose their medical licenses, they often move to other
states and find work.
</P>
<P>
   After the Sloan Kettering case, Arbit became the chief of
neurosurgery at the Staten Island hospital. Contacted several times
this week, the hospital spokeswoman, Arleen Ryback, said she knew
of no inquiry into Arbit or the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The state's letter to Staten Island University Hospital, dated
Tuesday, is highly unusual both in its language and its action. It
is likely a precursor to further departmental measures against the
doctor and possibly the hospital. In rare cases, the department
seeks to suspend doctors' licenses temporarily or gets them to stop
practicing medicine while it completes its investigation, if its
officials believe that a doctor is a danger to patients.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, state officials moved quickly as a protective
measure, the department spokeswoman, Smith, said. ``We recently
received credible information that would lead us to believe that
patients undergoing surgery by Dr. Arbit face potential risk,'' she
said.

   ORANGEBURG, S.C. _ Republicans sometimes seem to be everywhere
in South Carolina. But not in this small city an hour's ride south
of Columbia. It remains a Democratic stronghold, particularly a
stronghold of black Democrats, the backbone of the party in this
state.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the middle of farm country once heavily peopled by
slaves, Orangeburg is home to many black workers and black
businesses and to South Carolina State University, a well-regarded
predominantly black institution. It is not Bush country. It is not
McCain country. It is not even Keyes country.
</P>
<P>
   All three Republican presidential candidates, especially George
W. Bush and John McCain, have pleaded for crossover votes as they
search for a winning edge. But if random conversations this morning
with black Democrats who live here or go to school here are a
reliable indicator _ the state has almost no black Republicans _
neither man should expect to pick up any significant black support
in Saturday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us wouldn't consider a switch to begin with,'' said
Mike Bogan, 48, owner of an Orangeburg photo studio. ``I've voted
Democratic all my life. In recent years I've given some thought now
and again to voting independent. But there's no chance I'll make
any change this time, certainly not with Bush or McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Like almost everyone else interviewed, Bogan said it bothered
him that both men, rather than take a stand on whether the
Confederate battle flag should continue to fly over the Statehouse,
maintained that it was an issue for South Carolinians to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't what they said, it was what they didn't say,'' he
remarked. ``They ducked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogan said he found McCain an ``interesting'' candidate, a man
who deserved ``a lot of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the Vietnam War myself,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush?
</P>
<P>
   Bogan brushed him off with a wave of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   And Keyes?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a black man, and so if you're me, you pay attention, of
course,'' Bogan replied. ``He says some interesting things _ and
some things that are just too Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   To Jill Middleton, 39, a school services worker at Whittaker
Elementary School, not one of the Republican candidates merits
attention Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sure going to have to go it without my help,''
Middleton said. ``Not for a second have I considered a switch.
What's the point? Help who? I don't get it. Too complicated. But I
understand this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still mad at Republicans about that flag, and I'm even
madder about what they did to Clinton. They should have left it up
to Hillary to take care of that little mess. You can bet that's the
way I'd handle it if it ever came up in my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey A. Dowling, 49, a postal worker, said that he was ``more
or less'' aware of the issues in the Republican campaign,
especially the flag issue, but that he was not bothering to focus
on it because it had never crossed his mind to vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear what they're saying on the television and radio, and
then again I don't,'' Dowling said. ``It's hard not to hear some of
it the way it keeps coming at you. But if you're a good Democrat,
you just don't pay all that much attention.''
</P>
<P>
   As Dowling was interviewed at a barbershop, a local gospel
station played hymns in the background. ``I keep that station on
all day long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Was he aware that all three Republican candidates had talked in
the campaign about their religious beliefs, especially regarding
abortion?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine,'' he replied. ``But the basic message I want to hear
from them is not there, not for this Democrat.''
</P>
<P>

   F.A.O. SCHWARZ SUES CHIEF FOR MOVE TO TOYS `R' Us  
 (af)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what amounts to a grown-up toy war, F.A.O. Schwarz is suing
John Eyler, its former chairman and chief executive, for jumping to
the rival Toys ``R'' Us last month. The complaint says Eyler
violated the terms of his employment contract, which required him
to provide a year's notice before any departure and barred him from
working for a competitor for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed on Jan. 26 in state Supreme Court in Manhattan
by Schwarz and its parent company, Vendex KBB of the Netherlands,
also faults Eyler for walking away with $2.4 million that was paid,
in essence, to keep him around.
</P>
<P>
   Eyler, 52, who became the top executive of Schwarz in 1992, was
traveling Thursday and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz is seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent Eyler
from working at Toys ``R'' Us. A hearing has been scheduled on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A Toys ``R'' Us spokeswoman denied wrongdoing by the company and
on behalf of Eyler. ``We firmly believe the case has no merit
whatsoever, and we will, of course, vigorously defend the matter,''
the spokeswoman, Rebecca Caruso said. Janis Meyer, a lawyer with
Dewey Ballantine, which is representing Schwarz and Vendex, said
her clients declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the interesting details in the court papers is that Toys
``R'' Us and Schwarz held merger talks last year. The suit names
Toys ``R'' Us, of Paramus, N.J., as a co-defendant and says it
violated an agreement reached last June not to solicit or hire any
Schwarz officers or senior employees for two years.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Toys ``R'' Us was negotiating a possible purchase
of the chain or an Internet partnership. Though no deal resulted,
Toys ``R'' Us agreed not to court Schwarz employees for two years,
according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   While the toy sellers engage in their own wrestling over how far
an employment contract can go, companies of all types are using
``noncompete'' and other restrictive employment contracts. And
increasingly, in a vigorous economy and a tight labor market,
companies are taking a tough stance on these agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume there might be more impetus, as a practical matter,
to keep people on the reservation if they are harder to replace,''
said Don Collins, a New York University Law School professor. ``I
don't think that matters to the court much.''
</P>
<P>
   For some companies, the goal is to send a message to executives
considering jumping ship. Other employers are seeking to prevent
key executives' expertise benefiting a competitor as long as
possible. ``The theory of it is to starve you into submission,''
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The enforcement of such contracts varies greatly by state, with
spurned companies finding their cases stronger if they can show
harm or the loss of confidential company information.
</P>
<P>
   In the toy case, Schwarz contends that Eyler's move gives Toys
``R'' Us an unfair competitive edge because he departed with
knowledge of trade secrets and other confidential information.
</P>
<P>
   The big payment that Eyler received in January was intended as a
``golden parachute,'' should he leave after a change of control at
Schwarz. Vendex merged with the toy seller's former owner in
November 1998. Under his contract, he was entitled to $2.4 million
if he left within 12 to 18 months of that change, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the potentially rich severance package, Eyler
expressed ``serious concern'' to Vendex that he would have no
choice but to leave to collect it, according to the court filing.
Eager to keep him, the company agreed to give him the money by the
end of 1999 to negotiate a new employment contract.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us hired Eyler to help revive its business after five
months without a chief executive. The company said at the time that
it had hired Eyler for his ``passion and energy for the toy
business'' as well as his experience in electronic commerce and
catalog businesses.

 &HT;    French 1st, U.S. 2nd in downhill
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ Howling winds that whipped up the fresh snow
at the top of Whiteface Mountain delayed the first of two Winter
Goodwill Games downhill races for 4 1/2 hours Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When the winds died down, a Frenchman with a name as white as
snow surprised the favored Austrians _ as well as himself.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Blanc, whose best finish this World Cup season was a tie
for 17th, schussed out of 17th position to win the race with a time
of 1 minute, 49.84 seconds. Blanc, who grew up in the 1968 Olympic
city of Grenoble, won the $20,000 first prize, the most lucrative
in the Goodwill Games' $650,000 purse.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Puckett of Boulder, Colo., who started 20th among
the 23 racers, was second in 1:49.96, bumping Canadian Kevin Wert
(1:50.32) to third. The top Austrian, 1998 Olympic bronze medalist
Hannes Trinkl, was fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Another downhill _ with the same skiers, although some will try
different equipment and tactics _ is scheduled for this morning.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Thursday's race started, the temperature was about 5
degrees at the starthouse and shadows cast part of the course in
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would have thought in 100 years we would have had a
race,'' said Canadian Ed Podivinsky, who placed sixth. ``You'd be
up on the chairlift and wouldn't be able to see the ground. The
people who worked on the course were incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake Placid organizers were eager to show off a course that has
changed since the 1980 Olympics, when Austrians went 1-2 in the
downhill. They hope to return the venue to the World Cup circuit,
which has no sites in eastern North America.
</P>
<P>
   The Whiteface Mountain run calls for very technical turning at
the top, but favors gliders at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a surprise to win on this course, as I am so light and
do not normally do well in the flats,'' said the 176-pounf Blanc.
``My speed in this race came at the top of the course where it was
steep.''
</P>
<P>
   Wert, who weighs in at a solid 230 pounds, had been the early
leader after gaining ground at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the law of gravity, bigger things fall faster, you
know?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wert's smile disappeared when Blanc's time flashed on the
scoreboard, and he left the finish area, whistling joylessly, after
Puckett cruised in.
</P>
<P>
   The top 15 ranked skiers get to pick their numbers, but Puckett,
who is 16th, had to take what was left. By the time it was his
turn, he had to deal with flat light and deep shadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in the starting gate and it was dark all the way down,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Everything brightened when it was time to glide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how fast my skis were on the flat,'' said
Puckett. ``I couldn't believe it. I was lucky to hang on to them.
They really wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Puckett won $12,500. ``It's spent already. I have school
loans,'' said the Dartmouth graduate.
</P>
<P>
   He was thrilled to get some payback against all five Austrians
who came. Hermann Maier, the most famous Austrian downhiller, chose
to stay in Europe and compete in a World Cup, but Werner Franz (who
was seventh) and Fritz Strobl (11th) tied for first in a Super G
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of them have won World Cups this year, so it feels
pretty good to beat them,'' said Puckett. ``At least it tells me I
just have to keep doing what I'm doing and I'll be there someday.''
</P>
<P>
   And he still has today.

 &HT;    Inspired snowboarder

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ Tricia Byrnes wouldn't be a snowboarder if
not for her brother Doug.
</P>
<P>
   ``All his friends were snowboarders and I wanted to be cool and
mingle with the dudes,'' the New Canaan, Conn., native said
Thursday after winning the Winter Goodwill Games women's halfpipe
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Doug died suddenly last summer at age 27 from a asthma attack,
sending Tricia's world into a backward slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm OK with it, then all of a sudden, I go, `I can't
get my head together,''' said Byrnes, 25, who was the 1999 FIS
World Cup champion, but has struggled this season. ``It's just
rough. You go through phases of healing.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrnes said she feels blessed that despite a busy travel
schedule, she was in town and visited Doug the evening before he
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just weird, you can't curse the ground or anything
because he only got 27 years,'' she said. ``I feel really lucky to
have had him around my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrnes won seven World Cups last winter and is now on her way to
Japan. She threw down some 540s in her two halfpipe runs Thursday,
totaling 41.80 points on her first attempt to defeat teammate Kelly
Clark, who scored 41.50 on her second.
</P>
<P>
   Byrnes, who won $5,400, doesn't consider herself an innovator.
She leaves that to the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our tricks are from skatebording,'' Byrnes said, ``and the
men are so much bigger. They can land on their head, and they're
like `Oh, OK.' Girls are like, `Ow, my pinkie!' But I try.''

   In a statement in the Dublin weekly paper Republican News, the
Irish Republican Army blamed Britain for the suspension of the new
Belfast government and said the act should be immediately
rescinded, saying it was up to British officials to ``repair the

 MOSCOW: sometimes disappear.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider this tangle of accounts and relationships. In the
documents filed in U.S. District Court Wednesday in Manhattan, both
MDM and Sobinbank were mentioned as participants in wire transfers
to the Benex and BECS accounts. And the same documents say that
funds transferred to Benex and BECS between February 1996 and the
fall of that year went through an account at the Bank of New York
held by MDM, the Russian initials for Moscow Business World bank.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, Edwards allegedly opened an account for
Sobinbank which was later substituted by an account for DKB, or in
English, Deposit Clearing Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Two year later, money from Flamingo went to yet another account
at the bank set up by Edwards and her husband, in the name of
Lowland, via Sobinbank of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, acting on a tip from federal investigators in the
Bank of New York scandal, Russian agents swooped down on Flamingo
and scooped up $430,000 and 3.3 million rubles in loose cash lying
around its offices, unaccounted for and otherwise undocumented.
Russia's prosecutors have since brought criminal charges against
Flamingo for ``illegal banking activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the raid on Flamingo, Moscow city police launched an
investigation at Sobinbank headquarters in October, during which
they opened up safety deposit boxes held in the bank vaults. In one
box, held by a deputy director of an institute connected to the
Russian space program, they found $1.6 million in cash, and 6 kilos
of gold ingots. No charges have been brought against Sobinbank.
</P>
<P>
   Audits of SBS-Agro, a bank that is now virtually bankrupt, by
Arthur Andersen in the late 1990s, described Sobinbank as a
``subsidiary'' of SBS-Agro, which the auditors found also owned 20
percent of the shares in Flamingo.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Sobinbank also became partly owned by Manezh,
developers of Manezhnaya Ploshchad, the vast and ambitious
underground shopping mall at the foot of the Kremlin that was a pet
project of Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and one of his favorite
businessmen, Umar Dzhabrailov. Other shareholders include Lukoil, a
major Russian oil company; Energia, the company that builds space
craft; and two other smaller banks.
</P>
<P>
   Later, both MDM, which was regarded as a well run institution,
and Sobinbank were to share the same patron _ Alexander Mamut, a
soft spoken young lawyer and banker who is closely tied to the
Family, the nickname given to an inner circle of advisers that
surrounded former Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his daughter,
Tatyana Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   Mamut, who had his own bank known as KOPF, became a member of
the Sobinbank board of directors in 1997, where he remained until
he became chairman of the MDM board last year. In each case, he
appears to have helped bring significant clients, including
Sibneft; Almazy Rossii-Sakha, Russia's largest diamond company; and
Energia, the space program company.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that the scheme survived because it had the benefit
of powerful political patrons in Moscow. But the Russian banker
familiar with scheme said that the Benex accounts' good reputation
also came from the protection it seemed to enjoy at the Bank of New
York, which had a significant business in Moscow. ``They
established a niche,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed last fall, Sobinbank president Alexander Zanadvorov
insisted he had never met either Edwards or Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand it, Benex and BECS worked actively with
Russian banks and Russian companies,'' he said. ``If anyone wanted
to, they could drag in a lot of banks and companies into this.''

HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE SEEKS HALT IN ANTHRAX VACCINATIONS FOR MILITARY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ind., Del., Conn., Mich.) (Updates, revisions, additions thruout) 
 (rk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House subcommittee released a scalding critique
Thursday of the Pentagon's effort to vaccinate American troops
against the biological agent anthrax, and said the program should
be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee said the anthrax vaccination program relied on
incomplete, outdated science and suffered from poor planning, and
said no members of the military should be given the shots until
questions about their effectiveness and adverse side-effects were
answered. Acknowledging intelligence warnings of the possibility of
an attack with anthrax, it recommended that the Pentagon speed
research for a safer vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared by the national security subcommittee of
the House Committee on Government Reform, dealt another blow to the
Pentagon's anthrax program, which has faced delays, cost overruns
and resistance from some service members.
</P>
<P>
   The report's recommendations, which came after a yearlong
review, are not binding, but they could give momentum to efforts in
Congress to force a halt to the vaccinations. In the wake of
growing protests from service members who have refused to take the
shots, House members have proposed legislation that would make the
program voluntary or suspend it until the National Institutes of
Health completed a study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked early on that this might actually be a solution,''
said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., referring to the vaccination
program. ``But the more you dig into this, the more you realize
this is more of a political solution than a substantive medical
solution to the question of chemical and biological technology.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon Thursday, senior officials defended the program,
saying the questions raised by the House members would not stop the
vaccinations of troops against the possibility of attack from one
of the deadliest known biological weapons. Anthrax spores, if
inhaled, can cause an infectious disease that can kill within days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very safe and effective vaccine against a very
deadly biologic agent that we know to be in the hands of many of
our adversaries and could be used against our forces,'' said Dr.
Sue Bailey, a physician who is assistant secretary of defense for
health affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Although no country has ever used anthrax in battle,
intelligence reports have indicated that at least 10 countries,
including Iraq and North Korea, have the ability to make biological
weapons. That prompted an order in 1997 from Secretary of Defense
William Cohen that all 2.4 million active and reserve troops be
vaccinated. The first vaccinations _ a series of six shots over 18
months, followed by annual boosters _ began the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccinations have been controversial from the start. The
Pentagon says at least 350 service members, including many in the
National Guard and Reserves, have balked at taking the shots,
though critics say that number underestimates those who have left
service because of concerns about the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pentagon insists those who have balked represented
only a fraction of the 400,000 who have received at least one shot,
the resistance has proved embarrassing, leading to courts-martial
and discharges. On Wednesday, the Air Force avoided its first
court-martial of an officer for refusing the vaccine when Maj.
Sonnie G. Bates, a pilot at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware,
agreed to face a lesser administrative review, which is likely to
end in a discharge.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee's report said that while the Pentagon's program
was well intentioned, it was based on ``an excess of faith but a
paucity of science,'' and had raised serious doubts among service
members, doubts that were hurting recruiting and retention.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the vaccine
in 1970, primarily for people who worked with cattle or sheep,
which can pass the bacterium through the human skin. But the report
said the vaccine was never proven effective against airborne
spores, which is how anthrax would be used as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn.,
said that without more studies, the vaccination should be treated
as an experimental drug, which would require an individual to
consent to the shots.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited fevers, muscle aches and other flu-like
symptoms that soldiers have experienced after receiving the anthrax
shots, saying the Pentagon had not thoroughly studied the vaccine's
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said Thursday that there had been 600 reports of adverse
reactions, and 70 of those made people sick enough to be out of
work for a day or hospitalized. She said the percentage of symptoms
was in line with side effects from other vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee criticized the Pentagon's support for the only
manufacturer of the vaccine, the Bioport Corp. of Lansing, Mich.
After Bioport took over the production of anthrax from a state
laboratory, the Pentagon had to nearly double its $29 million
contract for the vaccine because the company had underestimated its
costs.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Pentagon halted a planned expansion of the
vaccinations because the FDA could not approve Bioport's new
production facility. Troops deploying to places where an anthrax
attack is considered possible _ including the Persian Gulf and
Korea _ are still receiving the shots, but the problems at Bioport
have delayed plans to vaccinate all 2.4 million service members.

   Greenspan Hints That Fed Will Increase Rates More
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the
economy showed few signs of slowing despite four interest rate
increases in eight months, and he warned in unusually direct terms
that the central bank would probably raise rates further to avert
inflation. In testimony to the House Banking Committee, he also set
what amounted to a speed limit for Wall Street, saying that
wringing the risk of inflation out of the economy would require
that stock and other asset prices rise no faster than household
incomes.

management transition. Daft quickly took charge, eliminating the
need for Ivester to remain.

A JOCKEY GREAT TO EMULATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Corey Nakatani says his fast start at Santa
Anita was inspired by Laffit Pincay's history-making performance at
Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (watching Pincay) kind of got the spark going for me
again,'' Nakatani said this week at Santa Anita, where he led the
jockeys with 45 victories through Wednesday's races.
</P>
<P>
   That's not only flattering to Pincay. It says good things about
Nakatani as well.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the younger jockey appeared to be inspired by
darker forces. In the decade since he was the nation's richest
apprentice rider in 1989, the former high school wrestler from
Covina earned a reputation as a hothead without the proper
reverence for his sport.
</P>
<P>
   He was fined for head-butting one rival jockey after a race,
suspended for shoving another off his mount on the gallop-out,
fined and suspended for whipping a horse in apparent frustration on
the gallop-back.
</P>
<P>
   He was battling pressures that went beyond a jockey's typical
year-round mental and physical strains. In a matter of months in
1996-97, he lost a cousin to cancer, a sister to murder and his
father to a heart attack. But whatever sympathy those tragedies won
him, Nakatani couldn't shake the image of an immature young man
whose athletic gifts came too easily. In a sport that demands
absolute dedication, he seemed too eager to get to the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Every rider needs an emotional boost now and then. For Nakatani,
who will turn 30 in October, it came in December, courtesy of the
amazing Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 10, Pincay, at age 52, rode his 8,834th winner to break
Bill Shoemaker's career record. Pincay went on to lead the
Hollywood Park jockeys and become the oldest rider to win a title
at a major North American track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so gratifying to see him reach a goal that a lot of
people said he wasn't going to reach,'' Nakatani, who shares agent
Bob Meldahl with Pincay, said in the Santa Anita jockeys' lunch
room.'' ``People like yourself wrote articles that he'd have to go
to Bay Meadows (to break the record).
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) he's not a quitter. He's got more desire and will than
anybody I've ever met. I've never seen anybody who does the things
he does just to ride races. I look at him every day and see how he
takes care of himself and how he presents himself. He's an
unbelievable person.''
</P>
<P>
   During Pincay's record run, Nakatani found out more about the
Panamanian's 35-year career than he'd learned by riding next to him
for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read all about his accomplishments and it got the fire in me
going again,'' Nakatani said. ``I've been out here (exercising
horses) every morning at 5:30, rain or shine. People say to me,
`What are you doing out here?' I just say, `I'm hungry. I want to
do it again. I want to be on top. I want to do the things that
Laffit accomplished.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani said watching the dignified way Pincay carried himself
as he neared the record and interview and autograph requests
increased, and seeing how the other Hall of Famers on the Southern
California circuit behave, has been an inspiration too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the way people handle themselves, the (Chris)
McCarrons, the Pincays, and the respect they get,'' Nakatani said.
``I go to restaurants with them and see the desire they have just
by the way they eat.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't eat much.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nakatani has the old hunger back, too.
</P>
<P>
   At Hollywood Park, he won with a huge 26 percent of his mounts
but didn't ride enough races to contend for the title. He finished
third behind Pincay and Pat Valenzuela. At Santa Anita, his
percentage is again around 25 and he's among the busiest riders. He
has opened a 15-win lead over Kent Desormeaux as the meet nears its
midpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Nakatani holds an early lead in purses with more
than $2.1 million, nearly $900,000 more than second-place Alex
Solis.
</P>
<P>
   If he goes on to win the Santa Anita title, it will be his first
at any track since 1996. And it will complete a rebound from the
1998-99 Santa Anita meet, during which he finished seventh with
just 43 wins.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Nakatani was riding under contract to The
Thoroughbred Corp., giving him security but costing him mounts with
other barns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm focused, I'm back on track,'' he said this week. ``And I'm
looking forward to riding more horses for more people.''
</P>
<P>
   And in more places. Nakatani will be out of town this weekend to
ride 3-year-olds Greenwood Lake for trainer Nick Zito in Saturday's
Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream Park in Florida and Exchange Rate
for D. Wayne Lukas in Sunday's Risen Star at the Fair Grounds in
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be back at Santa Anita on the holiday Monday to ride The
Fly in the San Luis Obispo Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Future is here: Very early ``morning line'' odds for the May 6
Kentucky Derby show the balance of power is in California. D. Wayne
Lukas-trained filly Surfside and the Neil Drysdale-trained War
Chant are 8-1 co-favorites, with Captain Steve and The Deputy 10-1,
and 2-year-old champion Anees one of several horses at 15-1.
</P>
<P>
   These are the projected odds on Churchill Downs' first Derby
Future Wager pool, which opened Thursday and closes Sunday
afternoon. Later pools will be open March 9-12 and April 13-16.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't be able to place bets from California because
state law prohibits tracks here from taking bets on events more
than seven days in advance. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
Santa Anita leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Corey Nakatani,
45 wins; Kent Desormeaux, 30; David Flores and Alex Solis, 27;
Laffit Pincay, 24; Victor Espinoza, 21. Trainers: Bob Baffert, 19;
Bobby Frankel, 18; Ron Ellis and Bill Spawr, 10; Richard Mandella
and Ron McAnally, 9.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay watch: Winning the $50,000 Glendale Handicap at Turf
Paradise aboard Perfectly Clear last Saturday gave Laffit Pincay a
victory on 10 straight racing days. The streak ended with an
0-for-3 performance Sunday at Santa Anita, but Pincay bounced back
with two wins Wednesday, raising his career-record total to 8,869.
</P>
<P>
   On the stakes schedule: At Santa Anita: Saturday, $100,000 Boo
La Boo Stakes, 3-year-old fillies bred in California, 6 furlongs,
and $75,000 San Marino Handicap, 4-year-olds and up, 1 miles on
turf; Sunday, $125,000 Las Flores Handicap, fillies and mares 4 and
up, 6 furlongs; Monday, $200,000 San Luis Obispo Handicap,
4-year-olds and up, 1 miles on turf. At Bay Meadows: Saturday,
$100,000 Ken Maddy Sprint, Cal-bred 4-year-olds and up, 6 furlongs.
At Gulfstream Park: Saturday, $200,000 Fountain of Youth,
3-year-olds, 1 1/16 miles; Sunday, $100,000 Davona Dale, 3-year-old
fillies, 1 mile 70 yards. At Fair Grounds: Sunday, $125,000 Risen
Star, 3-year-olds, 1 1/16 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Mileposts: Real Quiet, the 1998 Kentucky Derby and Preakness
winner, who hadn't raced since winning the 1999 Hollywood Gold Cup,
was officially retired this week. The 5-year-old will stand at the
Vinery in Kentucky for a stud fee of $25,000 a foal. Real Quiet
earned $3.2 million by recording six wins (five in Grade I stakes),
five seconds and six thirds in 20 starts.... Also retired, with a
minor injury: Soaring Softly, the 1999 female turf champion....
Genuine Risk, the second filly to win the Kentucky Derby (1980) but
a flop as a broodmare, has been pensioned to owners Bert and Diana
Firestone's Virginia farm. She's 23 and has been barren the past
three years. She didn't produced a foal until 1993 and none of her
offspring has made it to the racetrack.... Santa Maria Handicap
winner Manistique will aim for a repeat in the March 5 Santa
Margarita.... Del Mar has renamed the Chula Vista Handicap for
fillies and mares as the Clemente L. Hirsch Handicap for its Aug.
12 running to honor the track's 85-year-old vice president. Hirsch
is a founder of the Oak Tree Racing Association.... Worldly Manner,
starting for the first time since he was seventh in the Kentucky
Derby and 12th in the Preakness, finished second by a nose in a
stakes race last week in Dubai.

 &HT;    Lewis warmly welcomed home
 &HT;    By Mike Fish and Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Ray Lewis proclaimed his innocence Thursday to a
hometown that rallied around the NFL superstar and mostly blamed
his troubles on _ of all things _ Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of this historic city greeted their gridiron great
more as a returning hero than an accused killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard it many times before. Now you get to hear it from
me: I am innocent,'' Lewis said at a televised news conference at
the Baltimore Ravens' training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some see Lewis as the victim of what they perceive as
the South's backward, backwoods approach to law and order. And
hearing him make the short speech in his defense, they were worried
for him _ not only for his football future but for his survival in
Atlanta's judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first heard about it, we were thinking, 'He's in the
middle of the South. If he's convicted, he's going to die''' in the
electric chair, said Jamie Stevens, 27, a clerk at a Mailboxes,
Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Roop, 48, a legal secretary, said she's heard the South
is ``a little harsher on blacks,'' and wonders whether prejudice
led Atlanta police to arrest Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Lewis' 75-second statement _ his first public utterance
since being charged with murder Jan. 31 in Atlanta _ people could
be seen nodding their heads. Many said he sounded sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping he didn't do it because he's an idol to a lot of
children here,'' said Toya Knight, a 22-year-old college student
who watched Lewis' statement in a sports bar near Baltimore's
famous Inner Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   But others were not so sure. To many here, it seems absurd even
to mention the words ``murder'' and ``Ray Lewis'' in the same
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts about his guilt run so deep that a Web site hawks
T-shirts that say ``Free Ray Lewis.'' In many quarters, strident
support for Lewis mingles with confidence that he will be cleared _
and anger that Atlanta kept him in jail for 15 days with no bail.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to make a mockery out of the prosecution,''
Eddie Rafus, a 45-year-old retiree, said of Lewis' defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Many believed from the start that the star middle linebacker,
who led the NFL in tackles last season, was innocent. Hearing him
say it, though, bolstered their confidence and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very sorry about the tragedy that occurred in Atlanta,''
said Lewis, dressed in a gray sweater with white stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis refused to answer questions, emphasizing a gag order on
the case. ``All I can do is sit back and wait for justice to take
its course and everything else to take its natural course. But I'm
looking forward to the day all the facts come out, everything is
out in front and my name is cleared,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis appeared solemn at Thursday's news conference, accompanied
by his friend and Baltimore attorney Ron Cherry and several team
officials _ including Ravens owner Art Modell and head coach Brian
Billick. Lewis had just arrived from Atlanta on a private jet
chartered by Modell.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis expressed his condolences to the victims' families,
saying: ``My sympathy goes out to the family and the friends of
both men that died.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is free on $1 million bond. He is charged _ along with
Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting _ in the stabbing death of two
young Decatur, Ga., men after a Super Bowl party in Buckhead,
Atlanta's entertainment district.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Byrne, a Ravens vice president, said Lewis' lead attorney
in Atlanta, Ed Garland, is seriously considering whether to file a
speedy-trial motion under Georgia law, which could mean a late
April or May trial date. Criminal defense attorneys said such a
motion is normally filed if an attorney is confident in his case or
senses a weakness in the prosecutor's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ravens understand that Ray wants a speedy trial so he can
prove his innocence and get on with his life,'' Byrne said. ``Ed
Garland will make the decision whether to ask (for an early start
to the trial) _ not the Ravens. But he is good about keeping us in
the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the Atlanta-bashing Thursday, many of Lewis' supporters
dismissed race as an issue because all three suspects and both
victims _ as well as the mayor, police chief and district attorney
in Atlanta _ are black. Among those making that distinction was
Larry Young, who hosts a call-in radio show on WBOL-AM, a station
whose audience is predominantly black.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming majority of the callers ... believe in Ray
Lewis' innocence,'' Young said. ``It's very much the talk of the
barber shops and beauty salons and taxi cabs and coffee shops.''
</P>
<P>
   He summarized Lewis' predicament: ``Wrong place, wrong time,
wrong crowd, wrong state.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others in Baltimore assailed Georgia's felony murder
rule, which says that anyone who commits a felony that leads to a
death can be convicted of murder _ whether or not there is intent
to kill.
</P>
<P>
   While he awaits trial on the murder charge, Lewis' life in
Baltimore has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland's corrections department will monitor compliance to the
conditions of his bond.
</P>
<P>
   LaMont Flanagan, commissioner of pretrial detention and services
for Maryland, said his department will conduct weekly tests for
drugs and alcohol. A caseworker will meet with Lewis weekly at the
pretrial services office in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis will not be required to wear a monitoring ankle bracelet
``at this time,'' Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the Baltimore sentiment, Billick expressed the
team's support of Lewis, going so far as to say he would have use
of Ravens' facilities to prepare for the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   A team official said Modell has been in contact with NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue, but neither the team nor the league is
ready to impose any disciplinary action, opting instead to see how
the case develops over the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   The first mandatory team function for Lewis is an April 28-30
mini-camp for veterans, followed by the start of training camp in
late July.
</P>
<P>
   It could create a public relations nightmare, however, if the
NFL were to suit up a player awaiting trial on murder and assault
charges.
</P>
<P>
   At minimum, Lewis' attorneys would have to request terms of his
bond release be modified, specifically a 9 p.m. curfew and a
restriction that he travel only between his home in Baltimore and
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the pro football players union said Thursday one
scenario might be for the NFL to grant Lewis a leave-of-absence
with pay while awaiting an outcome of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   However, legal counsel for the NFL Players Association said it
would likely file an appeal with an arbitrator if the league
attempts to prevent Lewis from earning a living while he's free on
bail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly have been situations where criminal charges
have been pending against a player and he was allowed to play,''
said Richard Berthelsen, NFLPA general counsel. ``We'd have to see
the circumstances at the time, but if a player is merely charged
with a crime and there are no restrictions on his ability to work,
I would see no reason why he shouldn't be allowed to play and earn
a living for his family.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 PG&AMP;E Given Huge Rate Increase  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. was handed one of its largest rate
increases ever yesterday when state regulators ended a year of
acrimonious debate by approving the most generous of three rival
funding proposals.
<P>
   The more than $450 million increase passed by the California
Public Utilities Commission was about half what PG&AMP;E had originally
requested but nearly twice the amount recommended by an
administrative law judge who had investigated the utility's budget
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates were shocked by the decision. They had
expected the PUC to adopt a roughly $350 million rate increase put
on the table this week by the commission's president, Richard
Bilas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is complete corporate welfare,'' said Nettie Hoge,
executive director of The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco
consumer group. ``There is no rationale for this decision. It's an
insult to ratepayers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a bad decision,'' agreed Martin Lyons, a
spokesman for the Office of Ratepayer Advocates. ``PG&AMP;E does not
require this level of funding.''
</P>
<P>
   According to TURN, the increase, which takes effect immediately,
will ultimately result in average residential power bills rising by
approximately $70 a year.
</P>
<P>
   However, PG&AMP;E insists that bills may actually decline as a
result of cost savings in other parts of the company's operations.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC estimates that residential gas bills will rise by about
$20 a year. Electricity rates are expected to remain frozen until
early next year under legislation passed in 1996 to restructure the
state's power industry. Electricity rates will probably drop about
10 percent when the freeze is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Finkelstein, staff attorney for TURN, said his group will
appeal yesterday's decision to the PUC within a month. If that
fails, he said, TURN may consider legal action.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC voted 3 to 2 to adopt the $453 million rate increase
proposed by Commissioner Carl Wood, who was appointed to the panel
only last June and is its newest member.
</P>
<P>
   He joined commissioners Josiah Neeper and Loretta Lynch in
supporting the rate increase, while Bilas and Henry Duque voted
against.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said the two other proposals on the table _ for $264
million and $357 million, respectively _ ``cut too deep into muscle
and bone.'' He termed his own rate increase ``tough but fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``PG&AMP;E asked for too much,'' Wood said. ``The amount it
requested exceeded the amount needed for reliable service.''
</P>
<P>
   The utility had requested an increase of $822 million and had
threatened that as many as 3,500 jobs could be lost if the amount
approved did not come close to that.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E also had warned that tree-trimming around power lines could
be scaled back as a result of insufficient funding.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, the utility was granted a rate increase of $824
million. Most other recent increases have been between $200 million
and $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement yesterday, the utility said the latest increase
``does not provide everything we asked for, but it does recognize
the need for additional support to maintain the high level of
service our customers expect and to invest in the energy
infrastructure for our fast-growing California economy.''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E has said it needs substantially more funding not only to
meet existing service requirements, but also to keep pace with the
state's explosive economic growth, especially in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The utility said yesterday it will support the PUC's decision,
including implementation of a ``quality assurance program''
mandated by the commissioners to improve PG&AMP;E's dealings with
customers, billing accuracy and response to power failures.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were clearly pleased with the outcome of the vote.
PG&AMP;E's stock gained $1.31 yesterday to close at $23.13. The
company's shares had plunged by 35 percent last year as the rate
case dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   A senior PG&AMP;E official, who requested anonymity, said it is not
yet clear whether the rate increase will result in any layoffs.
``This is putting us on a tight budget,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The official did say, however, that the increase will allow PG&AMP;E
to maintain its tree-trimming program. Last April, the utility
quietly agreed to pay about $29 million to settle charges that it
had endangered the public by not keeping tree branches away from
electrical lines.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the PUC accused PG&AMP;E of no fewer than 500,000 counts of
violating state tree-trimming laws from 1994 through 1998. Each
count could have resulted in a fine of as much as $20,000 or a
maximum penalty of $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The PG&AMP;E official emphasized that work will continue on
expanding the utility's resources to meet California's growing need
for energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing growth rates in our system that we've never seen
before,'' he said. ``We're replacing pipelines and investing in new
infrastructure in Silicon Valley. That's what this case is about.''
</P>
<P>
   But TURN's Hoge said the state's technology-driven economic
surge does not justify a more than $450 million rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a booming economy and low inflation,'' she said.
``What happened is that the utility exercised its political muscle
in Sacramento to get what it wanted. This is a total failure of
regulation.''

Clemson, S.C., found that the percentage of respondents who said

the group said published racially insensitive material. The group's
president, Ralph G. Neas, wrote that Quinn's magazine, Southern
Partisan, a leading journal of the neo-Confederate movement, has
repeatedly criticized the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson
Mandela and Abraham Lincoln and has depicted blacks in demeaning
ways. McCain and Quinn have repeatedly denied that Quinn holds
racist views, and the campaign said Thursday that he would remain
on staff.

   ADS ON ABORTION STANCE

   Former Sen. Bill Bradley's campaign began running a 30-second
television commercial Thursday that promotes his strong support for
abortion rights and, by implication, questions Vice President Al
Gore's. ``Of the five men running for president only one candidate
has been pro-choice for everyone,'' the narrator says, echoing

Bradley then comes on camera and says, ``This is the kind of issue

 _ SF CHRON  
 Corporate Bash for Windows  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Downplaying reports that its newest system may be infested with
bugs, Microsoft yesterday launched Windows 2000 _ the company's
most ambitious software project ever _ with a curious mix of
tech-speak and celebrity pomp.
<P>
   Windows 2000, the business operating system that the Seattle
software giant itself calls a ``bet the ranch'' product, officially
became available through about 2,000 retail channels yesterday,
though it's already on the desktops of some 150,000 users,
including Microsoft's own 75,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, who last month handed over the
chief executive post to longtime friend Steve Ballmer to take on
the role of chief software architect, led the wide-ranging Windows
2000 kickoff kick-off  &LR; at San Francisco's cavernous Bill Graham
Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the usual stylized demos and corporate testimonials
from the likes of Continental Airlines and ESPN, the presentation
featured a moving-van-size laptop, appearances by guitar guru
Carlos Santana; actor John O'Hurley, who played eccentric
businessman J. Peterman on the sitcom ``Seinfeld''; and Patrick
Stewart of ``Star Trek'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   And though there were plenty of jokes around the words
``enterprise'' and ``next generation,'' two serious themes
dominated the 90-minute presentation: Microsoft's desire to make
inroads in the high-end server market and the increased reliability
of Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since '95 (when Microsoft introduced its popular Windows 95
consumer operating system), some big things happened,'' Gates said.
``The Internet arrived and achieved critical mass. It's now viewed
as the future of communication and the future of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is billing Windows 2000, successor to its Windows NT
product, as the platform on which businesses can run Web sites and
manage information technology, as well as give workers a desktop
machine.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the company has embarked on a broad _ critics say maybe
too broad _ marketing campaign including billboards and bus cards
to build awareness of Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the ads, as well as yesterday's glitzy
dog-and-pony show, are aimed at IT professionals, the intended
Windows 2000 market. However, ``There will also be some enthusiasts
who will be interested in this product at home,'' said Deborah
Willingham, vice president of Windows Marketing, at a news
conference just after Santana finished playing the hit single
``Smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   In a mantra that has become familiar in the weeks leading up the
Windows 2000 launch, Willingham and others stressed that Windows
2000 isn't for consumers _ they should wait for Windows Millennium
Edition, the successor to Windows 98, which will garner its own
splashy launch sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the emphasis is on Windows 2000, the operating system
that is expected to generate more than $5 billion revenue over its
four-year life span and lay the groundwork for a slew of new
Microsoft products including the Windows 2000 Datacenter Server and
SQL Server 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It's also Microsoft's most complex project.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 represents about 35 million lines of code, almost
four years of work and about $2 billion in development costs.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off for that complexity could be compatibility
problems with customers' old software. Last week, the Gartner
Group, a Stamford, Conn., research organization, warned that up to
a quarter of Windows 2000 users might experience such glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gartenberg, Gartner Group's research director, said:
``The problem isn't whether Win 2000 is ready for the enterprise _
it probably is _ but whether the enterprise is ready for Windows
2000. A lot of companies still run a lot of old hardware and
software, including in-house applications that may not have been
updated in years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gartenberg expounded on a shadow that has hung over Microsoft
and the its stock over the past week. According to an internal memo
obtained by Smart Reseller Magazine, Microsoft said there were
63,000 glitches in the release version of Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But both Microsoft and Gartenberg minimized the bug report.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell much from that figure,'' Gartenberg said. ``It
probably includes results from (Microsoft's) automated testing
tools, which log anything they consider an anomaly _ even things as
trivial as an icon being 1 pixel out of place.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Enderle, an analyst at Giga Information Group, believes both
the compatibility and bug issues have been overplayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very impressed,'' he said. ``This is the kind of product
people have been expecting for five years. It has a reliability
that we haven't seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the giant laptop's screen unfolding to reveal
Santana, the crowd reacted most enthusiastically when Gates pulled
up a chart showing the results of a study by Ziff Davis Labs on the
number of times various Microsoft applications needed to be
rebooted after 90 days of continuous use. For Windows 95, a reboot
was needed every 2.1 days; Windows NT 4.0 users had to reboot every
5.2 days and Windows 2000 was still up after 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Other features that drew applause _ often led by two groups of
Microsoft staffers in vivid blue shirts seated on the mezzanine
level _ were the ability to transfer files between computers using
infrared technology and the ability to plug in a few new servers to
a Windows 2000-equipped network and have them handling their share
of a network's traffic with a few clicks.
</P>
<P>
   According to the nonprofit San Jose organization Transaction
Processing Performance Council, Windows 2000 running Microsoft's
SQL Server 2000 database program on Compaq hardware could handle
more than 152,000 transactions per minute, compared with the next
closest contender _ a Unix machine _ which could handle about
134,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fitted with four extra nodes, or processors, the Windows 2000
machines could field 227,000 transactions per minute, ``enough to
handle all of the e-commerce handled on the Web last year in two
days,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gartenberg, the Gartner Group analyst, said Windows 2000's
apparent performance gains don't necessarily make the system a
no-brainer for IT professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance they showed is not unimpressive,'' he said.
``But the implication is that (Windows 2000) solves all the issues
about the scalability (ability of a system to adapt to increased
demand) of NT, and the reality is, it doesn't. They were talking
about ... eight machines clustered together, and they were
comparing it with a single Unix machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the hoopla, Microsoft stock rose $2, closing at $99.63.

STUDY FINDS ABUSIVE CONDITIONS IN MEXICO'S MENTAL HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By MICHAEL WINERIP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long-term patients at Mexico's mental hospitals live in filthy,
abusive and dangerous conditions, and as many as half are epileptic
or mentally retarded and do not even belong in a psychiatric
institution, according to a study released Thursday by an
international human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions in Mexican institutions are among the worst we
have seen in the world,'' said Dr. Robert Okin, a human rights
inspector for Mental Disability Rights International who is also
chief of psychiatry at San Francisco General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The group's study focuses on long-term psychiatric hospitals,
known as ``granjas.'' ``One-third to one-half of the individuals
within Mexico's granjas are identified as people with epilepsy or
mental retardation,'' the report said. ``Such individuals do not
need or benefit from psychiatric institutionalization.''
</P>
<P>
   The human rights investigators, who made three inspection tours
of Mexican hospitals from July 1996 to last November, found feces
and urine soiling the floors of several wards. On an inspection in
1998, the director at one hospital, Sayago, ``reported a number of
deaths from infectious disease (bronchitis),'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The rights group, based in Washington, repeatedly noted
deterioration in patients because of failure to provide basic care.
``Due to the lack of physical therapy'' at Sayago, the report said,
``40 people have lost the ability to walk and are confined to
wheelchairs.''
</P>
<P>
   While the report finds that most of the patients could live in
the outside community, ``the majority remain within the institution
for life.''
</P>
<P>
   After a report on conditions at the Mexican institutions in The
New York Times Magazine in January, Health Secretary Jose Antonio
Gonzalez Fernandez began a tour of mental hospitals, acknowledging
that there were a ``lot of aspects to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Mexico City Thursday, members of the
rights team said Gonzalez had pledged an additional $3.6 million
for three institutions. Gonzalez did not respond to requests for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, several directors have acknowledged that a large
number of their patients did not need hospitalization, but said
those people had been abandoned by their families and had no place
to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mentally retarded should not be here,'' the director of
the Guadalajara state hospital, Dr. Daniel Ojeda, said. ``But
there's no place for them. This hospital is doing something it is
not qualified to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has scheduled a
hearing on conditions at Mexican institutions for March 2.
</P>
<P>
   According to the mental disabilities group, which has done
similar work throughout Latin America, Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union, Mexican hospital directors have ``reported
shortages of food, clothes and blankets.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said that at Hidalgo ``people are brought straight
from this ward to the dining area without an opportunity to wash
their hands or clean themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those able to get to a bathroom do not have access to toilet
paper,'' the study said. ``People on the ward are given medications
with water from a common bucket, using one cup passed from one
person to another.''
</P>
<P>
   The rights group recommended that Mexico begin to finance a
system of community housing programs for patients who should be
released. At present, there is not a single government-financed
group home or apartment program in all Mexico.

IN COVER-UP TRIAL, EX-OFFICER DESCRIBES HIS ATTACK ON LOUIMA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former police officer sentenced to 30 years in
prison for torturing Abner Louima in the bathroom of a Brooklyn
station house took the witness stand Thursday and described in
detail a simmering rage that led to the attack and an anguish that
eventually caused him to come forward and confess.
</P>
<P>
   In more than two hours of searing testimony in U.S. District
Court in Brooklyn, the former officer, Justin A. Volpe, delivered
an emotional account of how he pinned Louima against the bathroom
wall and confronted him face to face. Then, he said, in a mire of
confusion and anger over what he said was a defiant tone by Louima,
he rammed a broken broomstick into the defenseless man's rectum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I held the stick in front of his face to say `look what
happened, look what happened,''' Volpe recalled, adding that he
repeated the phrase using an expletive, `` `look what you made me
do,' and he didn't respond, he didn't say anything. I threw the
stick down and I picked him up and escorted him out of the
bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe was testifying in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn at the
trial of three other officers accused of conspiring to cover up the
attack. He said that the one officer, Charles Schwarz, never took
part in the assault and stunned the gallery to the point of silence
by saying that another officer, Thomas Wiese, stood by and did
nothing as Louima was tortured.
</P>
<P>
   In previous statements, Wiese has said that he walked into the
bathroom moments after the attack and discovered Volpe standing
alone with a stick in his hand as Louima sobbed at his feet.
Volpe's testimony Thursday was the first time that anyone has said
under oath that Wiese was inside the bathroom throughout the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   But more mesmerizing to the jury and the packed courtroom
Thursday was Volpe's excruciating account of the brutal assault
that made him infamous. At its height, he asserted that Schwarz,
who was convicted of being his accomplice, was, in fact, an
innocent man. His motivation for coming forth, he said, was to
clear his conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two months ago, I was sentenced to 30 years in prison,'' Volpe
said, swallowing his words and offering his palms in contrition.
``Part of reclaiming my life is to tell the truth about what
happened that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Haltingly, he continued: ``I can't live with myself and do my
time in peace by knowing that another man is paying for the crimes
that I did. It has nothing to do with friendship. It just has to do
with doing what's right in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the government has argued that Schwarz held
Louima down while he was attacked and that he then conspired with
Wiese and another officer on trial, Thomas Bruder, to get himself
off the hook. The defense maintains there was no conspiracy to hide
Schwarz's involvement because Schwarz was never involved.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Wiese now faces some degree of public ignominy because
of Volpe's testimony, it is unlikely to damage his chances in the
trial because the jury can only consider whether the three
defendants lied about Schwarz. Likewise, federal prosecutors are
unlikely to enter a new charge against Wiese because they consider
Volpe an untrustworthy witness who has previously lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Volpe's damning testimony, Wiese's lawyer, Joseph
Tacopina, decided not to conduct an cross-examination. ``The only
issue in this case is whether Charles Schwarz was in the bathroom
and the defendants lied about it,'' Tacopina said. ``In that
regard, I had nothing to ask Volpe.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Fischetti, Schwarz's lawyer, said his client was happy
with Volpe's testimony. ``We have said in openings and maintained
throughout the trial that Chuck Schwarz was never in the
bathroom,'' he said. ``Justin Volpe was there, and now he has
testified to that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning earlier by Fischetti, Volpe offered his
dramatic account of the events on the night of Aug. 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe said that while responding to a call that night at Club
Rendezvous, a Haitian dance hall in Flatbush, Brooklyn, he was
punched in the head and knocked to the ground by a man he thought
was Louima. Louima was arrested and taken to the 70th Precinct
station house, Volpe said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the police station, Volpe said, he took off his
bulletproof vest, his gun belt and and other equipment and went
into an empty room to be alone. He wanted to unwind from the fracas
on the street, he said, but he could not put the scuffle out of his
mind. ``I was just collecting myself,'' he said, ``and I started to
become angry.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a broom in the empty room, he said, and he picked it
up and snapped the handle in half. ``I was going to take that stick
and threaten him with it or possibly even hit him with it,'' Volpe
testified. ``I took that stick and put it in the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Volpe returned to the front desk and took custody
of Louima, whose pants and underwear were down around his knees, he
said. (He later testified that he did not see who had pulled down
Louima's pants.) He led the prisoner into the bathroom, he said,
then pushed Louima up against the wall and stood in front of him
face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you curse at me on the street and why did you punch
me?''he said he asked Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Louima cursed in response, Volpe said. He threw a punch at
Louima's chest. Then, ``I grabbed him by his arms,'' Volpe said,
``and I threw him to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Louima was face down on the bathroom floor, his head near a
toilet, Volpe said. ``At this point, I had a lot of emotions that I
never, ever felt before in my life,'' he said. ``I felt frustrated,
very confused and I didn't know how to proceed with the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Volpe found the stick where he had left it in a
garbage can, he said. He placed the stick near Louima's buttocks,
thinking, as he described it, ``that that would scare him
somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice while they were standing, Volpe said, he had asked Louima
to apologize for striking him on the street. Both times, he added,
Louima did not apologize.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor, ``I asked him one more time, do you have anything
to say,'' Volpe testified, pausing now, releasing breath. Louima
mumbled something, something aggressive, Volpe said _ ``possibly a
curse.'' Then he went on, ``And I tensed up and I pushed the stick
into his rectum.''
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, Lauren Resnick, an assistant U.S.
attorney, suggested that Volpe was lying about Schwarz and that he
was seeking to implicate Wiese out of revenge. Early in the
investigation, Wiese had approached the authorities to give a
statement about Volpe but was rebuffed when he failed a lie
detector test.
</P>
<P>
   But Volpe said he was hoping to put an end to the case once and
for all. ``I am telling the truth about what happened that night to
clear it up,'' he said, ``not just for me, but for the officers,
for Louima and his family, for the newspapers and for everyone so
that they can go with their lives and there would be some closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who better to do that than me. I'm the man that assaulted
Louima.''

ADVERTISING: TIME INC. PLANS MAGAZINE ABOUT SIMPLIFYING LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a frenetic era when most women feel more pressed
than ever, how can a publisher persuade them to squeeze another
magazine into their busy lives? With some help from a longtime
agency executive, Time Inc. believes it's really simple _ er, make
that Real Simple.
</P>
<P>
   Real Simple is the name of the publication that the People
Magazine Group of Time Inc. in New York, owned by Time Warner Inc.,
plans to introduce in late March. The goal of the magazine, which
is to appear 8 times this year and then 10 times a year starting in
2001, is to help its readers _ projected to be college-educated
working women and mothers with a median age of 36 _ simplify their
overextended lives.
</P>
<P>
   The role taken in the development of Real Simple by the agency
executive, Mary Lou Quinlan, who heads a year-old New York shop
named Just Ask a Woman, is emblematic of the rewriting of the rules
by which the advertising, marketing and media industries operate as
the major figures redefine the parts they play.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, J. Walter Thompson USA, part of the WPP Group, has
formed an alliance with Basic Entertainment, the powerful Hollywood
talent management company, focused on entertainment marketing.
Unilever, the consumer products giant, is starting an Internet
company with Ivillage Inc., a Web site operator, to provide online
information to women. And Tyler Brule, who founded Wallpaper
magazine, now owned by Time Inc., has started a consulting company,
Wink Media, to produce ads and customized magazines for marketers
and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hired Just Ask a Woman as a strategic and creative
consultant, to develop advertising, help with research and
collaborate with'' the top editorial and design staff members of
Real Simple, said Andy Sareyan, publisher at the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so clear the concept of this magazine is playing right to
so much of America,'' he added. ``People see the ability to control
your life as a sign of success.''
</P>
<P>
   That is encapsulated in the theme of the consumer and trade
advertising and promotion campaign for Real Simple, which rewrites
the familiar assertion that ``Less is more'' to declare: ``Do less.
Have more.'' The campaign, now getting under way, is one of many
elements of Real Simple developed under the aegis of Just Ask a
Woman, a division of BDM Inc., the agency company recently formed
by the merger of the MacManus Group, the former parent of Just Ask
a Woman, and the Leo Group, parent of agencies like Leo Burnett Co.
</P>
<P>
   Quinlan is a model of sorts for Real Simple because, she said,
``I had an affinity for the idea of simplifying your life; I did it
myself.'' Her reference was to her career choice early last year,
leaving another BDM agency, N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners in New York, where
she had been chief executive since 1995, to take on the task of
opening what became Just Ask a Woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took five weeks off to think about what I wanted from life
and redesigned it,'' Quinlan said, adding, ``Everyone says `You
look younger now' and I say `I'm happy now, that's why.'''
</P>
<P>
   The work done by Just Ask a Woman included showing prototypes of
the magazine to potential readers in focus groups, asking them
about ad campaign ideas and seeking opinions on ``what simplicity
means today,'' Quinlan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they talked about was quality, not quantity,'' she added.
``The premise of doing less and still having more was powerful.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But isn't there an inherent contradiction in a magazine that
asks readers to pare their lives, clear the clutter and become
better organized while its ad pages encourage purchasing and
consuming still more goods and services?
</P>
<P>
   In other words, is Time Inc. a publishing house divided against
itself for introducing a glossy, ad-fat magazine devoted to
conspicuous inconsumption?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not heard one comment'' to that effect, said Robin
Domeniconi, associate publisher at Real Simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would walk into a room'' to describe the magazine to
agencies and advertisers, she added, ``and people would be nodding
their heads in a few minutes'' in agreement with the concept.
</P>
<P>
   The sales effort must have worked because Real Simple, which
will initially guarantee advertisers a circulation of 400,000, will
simply be packed with ad pages.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``the biggest launch in Time Inc. history,'' Sareyan said,
``sold out'' at 110 ad pages. Among the blue-chip advertisers are
Cadillac, Chanel, Citigroup, Liz Claiborne, Clinique, Crate and
Barrel, De Beers, Gap, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren,
Nordstrom, Reebok, Ann Taylor and Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about consuming less,'' Quinlan said of Real Simple.
``It's about consuming more selectively, not buying for the sake of
buying.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she added, an article in Real Simple about
decorating with flowers would say, ``It's not all that hard, just
get a few and stick them in a jar.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will run in the pages of sibling magazines like
Entertainment Weekly, In Style, Life, Parenting, People, Southern
Living, Sunset, Teen People and Travel and Leisure. The ad space is
being valued at $10 million to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   That would buy a lot of flower jars _ or from the Real Simple
perspective, a few truly wonderful jars.

Harley-Davidsons in Wisconsin; cotton, Elvis, a guitar in
Tennessee; potatoes and a hunter (or is that a survivalist?) in
Idaho. (Eric Noland/The Los Angeles Daily News)

GE ACHIEVES BREAKTHROUGH IN GAS POWER-TURBINE DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: spelling of Michehl R. Gent's first name is CQ) 
 (bl) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department and General Electric will
announce Friday a major breakthrough in natural-gas- powered
generating plants that will result in production of electricity
using 5.3 percent less fuel than the best current technologies.
</P>
<P>
   While that percentage may seem small, it is enormous by the
standards of an industry in which technologies often compete on the
basis of fractions of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department is labeling the breakthrough ``the
four-minute mile for electric plants.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, experts say, will be cheaper production of
electricity and a significant reduction in gases thought to cause
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The new plant achieves 60 percent efficiency, a significant
improvement over the 32 percent to 40 percent efficiency of typical
coal, gas and oil plants in use today. Most of today's generating
plants were built in the mid-1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Michehl R. Gent, president of the North American Electric
Reliability Council, said nearly all plants now being added run on
natural gas, meaning that as overall capacity grows and as old
plants are replaced with new ones, average efficiency of the system
will rise sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Linden, director of the energy and power center at the
Illinois Institute of Technology and former president of the Gas
Research Institute, said the introduction of high-efficiency gas
plants ``is revolutionizing the global power business.''
</P>
<P>
   As for cutting the emission of ``greenhouse gases,'' Linden said
that if the United States were to retire all its coal plants and
replace them with 60-percent-efficient natural gas plants, the
nation would meet two-thirds of its commitment under the Kyoto
accords.
</P>
<P>
   The generator, which GE calls the H System, produces far less
smog-causing nitrogen oxides than coal plants and some existing
natural gas plants.
</P>
<P>
   The gain comes from tricks of engineering and metallurgy. The
jet engine, for example, runs at temperatures above the melting
point of the metal used to capture energy from the burning gases.
Earlier efforts used air to cool the metal, but this air cuts
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The new GE system uses steam instead, circulating it through
serpentine channels inside the vanes and blades that direct
combustion gases. The steam is then recaptured to make yet more
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary turbine blades are made of metal that is formed by
millions of tiny crystals; under stress, the blades can break at
the boundaries between crystals. The H System blades are giant,
single crystals.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to be delivered Friday, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson calls the new plant ``nothing less than the future of
electric power generation for this country and for most of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds, ``Pardon me for crowing.''
</P>
<P>
   The department put $100 million into research and development
for the new design; General Electric says it spent another $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   The system produces a kilowatt-hour of electricity _ an amount
of power that will keep 10 100-watt bulbs burning for an hour _ on
5,685 British thermal units, or BTUs, of gas, compared with 5,990
BTUs for older gas systems.
</P>
<P>
   A good coal plant uses nearly 10,000 BTUs to produce the same
amount of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The difference may come to only one- or two-tenths of a cent per
kilowatt hour, not enough for a residential customer to feel, but
important for some industries. At current natural gas prices,
moving from 57 percent efficiency, the current standard, to 60
percent efficiency would save about $20 million over the 20-year
life of a 400-megawatt power plant. But beyond the dollar savings,
the development also means less carbon dioxide, the main gas
thought to aggravate global climate change.

TESTS REBUT `TERRIBLE SCARE' IN GENE STUDY ON CHILDREN, FDA
REPORTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reports that more than two dozen childhood brain
cancer patients may have been exposed to the viruses that cause
AIDS and hepatitis C during a gene therapy experiment turned out to
be ``a terrible scare,'' an official of the Food and Drug
Administration said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Dr. Kathryn Zoon, who directs the agency's Center
for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said FDA tests had
determined that the master batch used to manufacture the therapy, a
corrective gene encased in a weakened cold virus, was not tainted
despite previous results that indicated otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we have determined that the master virus bank
was not contaminated,'' Zoon said. While she would not entirely
rule out the possibility that patients in the trial were put at
risk, she said the most important testing was finished and ``there
is some assurance to patients that the information they were given
about contamination was not correct.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, one of two principal investigators in
the study, Dr. Laura C. Bowman, sounded elated and relieved by the
negative results. ``We are exceedingly gratified,'' said Bowman, a
pediatric oncologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in
Memphis, Tenn. ``Nobody was exposed to any kind of risk or any kind
of infection. I'm really sad for the families for all the grief and
anxiety that the disclosure of a false positive lab result
caused.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Bowman said the potential
contamination came to her attention last fall, but she did not
notify the FDA immediately because test results, which indicated
the presence of genetic material from the AIDS and hepatitis
viruses, were inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Still lacking final results, she informed the agency on Feb. 4,
she said, but withheld the news from patients' families because she
did not want to worry them. She notified them after receiving an
inquiry from the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted at St. Jude and Baylor College of Medicine,
has been placed on hold by the FDA, and Zoon said Thursday that the
hold had not been lifted. She said the agency planned to test some
additional lots of the ``tumor vaccine'' used in the study, but
would not say what, if any, action the agency might take as a
result of its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In gene therapy, scientists try to use healthy genes to replace
ones that cause disease. The field has been under intense scrutiny,
in large part because of the death of an 18-year-old patient at the
University of Pennsylvania last fall. The death prompted the FDA to
shut down all gene therapy experiments at Penn.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Jude-Baylor study enrolled 25 children with recurrent
neuroblastoma, a type of brain cancer that is universally fatal.
Most have since died of their underlying disease. Bowman said
Thursday night that she was busy calling patients and their parents
to tell them of the FDA's results. ``I'm alternating calls between
reporters and families,'' she said.

 ANALYSIS: CHARGES AGAINST BANK ARE POSSIBLE IN MONEY LAUNDERING
INQUIRY  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only a week ago, the Bank of New York enjoyed a brief respite
from the money laundering investigation that has engulfed it for
the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state regulators imposed embarrassing sanctions on
the bank that took it to task for lax supervision and weak controls
on money laundering. But the actions fell short of stricter
penalties that could have been imposed, which Bank of New York
officials described as a relief.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, the two main suspects in the investigation _
one of whom was a bank officer _ pleaded guilty to a range of
criminal charges including helping to launder money that flowed out
of Russia. And those confessions have raised the possibility that
the bank itself could face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The bank declined to comment Thursday on its potential liability
in the matter, and pinning down the bank's exposure is difficult
because prosecutors have wide discretion in deciding whether to
pursue charges against a company.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, corporations are legally liable for the actions of
their officers, and now that the two suspects _ a former bank vice
president, Lucy Edwards, and her husband, Peter Berlin _ are
cooperating with prosecutors, the stakes have suddenly risen for
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Berlin told a federal judge on Wednesday in
Manhattan that they ran a money laundering network tied to a
company called Benex International that illegally channeled the
money from Russia through the Bank of New York and on to overseas
accounts. They are expected to provide more testimony about others
at the bank who knew of the scheme, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher up in the organization knowledge flows, the easier
it is for the prosecution to make a case against the entity,'' said
Michael Zeldin, a former Justice Department official and a partner
with PricewaterhouseCoopers in Washington. ``If the head of a
division knows about it, then it's much worse than if some
lower-level employee knew.''
</P>
<P>
   So sorting out who knew what _ and when they knew it _ at the
Bank of New York will ultimately decide the company's fate in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even before regulators took action last week, they were
deeply divided about how high in the organization knowledge of the
Benex scheme went.
</P>
<P>
   According to people involved in the investigation, the New York
branch of the Federal Reserve withheld information from Federal
Reserve officials in Washington about what was known about the
scheme inside the bank and who knew it _ information that the New
York officials only passed on to the U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve officials in New York and Washington declined to
comment Thursday when asked about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has already implicated one Bank of New York employee.
She said she paid Svetlana Kudryavtsev, a former low-level bank
employee, to help oversee the Benex accounts. Kudryavtsev pleaded
innocent Thursday to federal charges that she lied to investigators
about having received money from Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors will have to implicate much more senior officials at
the bank than Kudryavtsev if they hope to bring a case against the
bank. Of course, the highest officer at the Bank of New York is its
chairman and chief executive, Thomas A. Renyi. No evidence has
surfaced indicating that Renyi had knowledge of the money
laundering scheme before federal investigators began their secret
inquiry in September 1998. In fact, bank officials did not alert
Renyi about the investigation until March 1999, according to a
person involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, red flags existed. Bank employees knew that Berlin and
Edwards were married, but this served only to shield the accounts
from scrutiny. In congressional testimony last fall, Renyi said the
fact that Berlin was married to ``a well-regarded bank officer''
had dissuaded bank auditors from looking closely at the Benex
accounts. He described that as ``a lapse on the part of the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Testimony from Edwards and Berlin about what was known of their
activities inside the bank is crucial to any possible criminal case
against the institution. One reason a federal money laundering
investigation of Citigroup has stalled is that investigators have
been unable to find enough witnesses at the bank with knowledge of
the alleged scheme, according to a federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors do not need to show that every higher-up at the Bank
of New York knew of the scheme there to bring a case against the
company. A federal money laundering case against the Bank of New
England in the late 1980s established the legal precedent that
knowledge among only a handful of employees implicates the entire
company.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York has been cooperating with the federal
investigation from the beginning, and that may offer some shield
from prosecutions _ as long as evidence provided by Edwards and
Berlin is not too damaging. So far, the bank has not been accused
of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, the
Bank of New York's shares plunged $2.4375, or 6.5 percent, to
$35.0626. Several other bank stocks slipped but not as much as Bank
of New York shares.

   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the House Banking Committee chairman,
said Thursday that he would subpoena Edwards and Berlin to testify
at a second round of hearings he plans to hold on the Bank of New
York investigation. A date for the hearings has not been set.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The Bank of New York story is seminally significant because it
represents a verifiable incident where the financial system has
been corrupted,'' Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a criminal suit is filed against the Bank of New York,
the company might take comfort in statistics because successful
money laundering prosecutions are rare.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 to 1998, the only years for which figures are
available, only three individuals were convicted in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan in money laundering cases not related to drugs,
according to Justice Department data compiled by the Transactional
Records Access Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization at Syracuse
University.
</P>
<P>
   And during the last decade, according to a newsletter, Money
Laundering Alert, only foreign banks have been indicted in the
United States on money laundering charges. No American banks have
been indicted.
</P>
<P>
   If the federal prosecutors in Manhattan decide to pursue money
laundering charges against the Bank of New York, the law
enforcement agency cannot proceed on its own. It will need
approvals from the Justice Department, which must authorize federal
indictments of financial institutions for money laundering.

 TV's MILLIONAIRE BRIDEGROOM HAS A PAST IN ENTERTAINMENT  
 (af)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Days after marrying, on national television, a woman he had
never met before, Rick Rockwell, identified on the show as a
multimillionaire real estate developer, Thursday became the talk of
his hometown, San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   It is a city where he is less well known for real estate than
for comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell was the central figure in a Fox television special,
``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' which drew spectacular
ratings Tuesday night. He appeared in shadows for much of the
telecast while 50 contestants offered themselves as prospective
brides. Rockwell selected Darva Conger, 34, an emergency room
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Details about Rockwell began to emerge Thursday, painting him as
a longtime comic performer, known mainly for elaborate stunts, like
chartering a plane and performing 10-minute stand-up routines in
six cities in one night, telling jokes for 30 straight hours in an
effort to set a Guinness world record, and, most recently, riding
from Los Angeles to Las Vegas on a bicycle to promote a comedy
club.
</P>
<P>
   The last event took place two years ago, said the owner of the
comedy club The Improv, Bud Friedman, who hired him for that stunt.
Mike Fleiss, the show's producer, said Thursday that he thought
Rockwell had not been a performer since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives emphasized Thrsday that they were aware Rockwell
had a show-business background and had fully disclosed that on the
show. Indeed, Mike Darnell, the Fox executive who conceived the
idea for the special, said Rockwell's ability to carry himself well
on camera and in front of an audience was one big reason he was
chosen.
</P>
<P>
   But Darnell said Rockwell had been thoroughly checked out and
qualified as a multimillionaire. ``That means at least $2
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, who was born Richard Balkey in Pittsburgh, listed
himself as a real estate developer and motivational speaker. He has
a Web site where he calls himself a ``corporate comedian.''
</P>
<P>
   On the site he includes a long list of corporations and groups
he has spoken before, including Johnson &AMP; Johnson and AT&AMP;T and the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. The resume also includes a claim that
Rockwell ``opened for Jay Leno in the main room of Caesar's
Tahoe.''
</P>
<P>
   A booking representative for Leno said Thursday that Rockwell
has never opened in Lake Tahoe for Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell has successfully invested in beachfront real estate in
San Diego, with some backing by his father, said Larry Himmel, a
former comedy partner of his who is now a reporter for KFMB-TV in
San Diego. Five Realtor associations in San Diego had not heard of
him.
</P>
<P>
   KFMB broadcast an interview Thursday night with a woman named
Gina Ord, who identified herself as a former girlfriend. Ord told
the station that she broke off the relationship with Rockwell six
months ago, and that he wanted to get back together but she was
unsure. She also said Rockwell called her two days before the show
and told her he was only doing it to advance his career as a
comedian and motivational speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell was best known in San Diego for his portrayal of
Skippy, a dim-witted beach bum on a sketch comedy program on KFMB
in the 1980s described by station officials as a ``poor man's
`Saturday Night Live.''' He appeared in a regular sketch with
Himmel. The running theme, the station officials said, was ``two
surfer dudes who couldn't get dates.''

THE SOUND OF ACRIMONY FILLS CAROLINA AIRWAVES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ ``Winning ugly'' may be taking on new meaning
in the closing days of the South Carolina primary campaign, as the
airwaves fill with a new round of acrimonious commercials,
virtually all directed toward Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In one, Carroll Campbell Jr., the former governor of South
Carolina and a leading supporter of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
suggests that McCain is the tool of a Democratic plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Send the Clinton-Gore Democrats a message Saturday,'' Campbell
says in the radio commercial. ``Vote for the man they're
desperately trying to stop: George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   In another advertisement, paid for by South Carolina and
national anti-abortion groups, McCain is portrayed as a closet
supporter of abortion rights. ``So if you want a strong pro-life
president, don't vote for John McCain,'' an announcer says.
</P>
<P>
   And in a new 30-second television commercial, the Bush campaign
paints McCain as a spendthrift in pushing one of the backbone
issues of his candidacy, campaign finance reform. ``Five times, he
voted to use your taxes to pay for political campaigns,'' a
narrator says. ``That's not real reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Never before in this campaign have the advertisements of both
major candidates for the Republican nomination become so obsessed
with a single subject: John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Although the look of their commercials differed in Iowa and New
Hampshire _ Bush's used more stylish film techniques _ they tended
to concentrate on themes and traits peculiar to each candidate. But
since McCain's renunciation of his own attack ads last week, and
especially in recent days, Bush's advertisements have become almost
unrelentingly aggressive. If anything, they are tougher now than
before McCain pulled back.
</P>
<P>
   The radio and television campaign, with a cost now estimated to
be approaching $6 million, includes everything from 30-second takes
to infomercial-length commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is running a half-hour program, a video of a recent meeting
with voters at the College of Charleston, once in each of the three
major media markets in South Carolina. McCain's 30-minute piece,
compiled from commercials and taped interviews, was broadcast once
this week on WIS in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   On the local news stations, the changes in the tone of the
advertising are being reported as if they were shifts in the
weather. As the anchors on WTMA, Charleston's leading talk radio
station, put it throughout the day: ``Texas Governor George W.
Bush's ad takes on Senator John McCain for negative campaigning.
McCain's final ad is positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the new advertisements McCain has introduced, his
campaign appears hopeful that voters will punish Bush for
attacking. In an upbeat commercial that the McCain forces began
broadcasting today, the senator is described as ``a Republican like
Ronald Reagan who can win,'' and reserves its combativeness for the
Democrats. ``I'm going to beat Al Gore like a drum,'' McCain
declares.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's radio commercials, running far less frequently here
than those of Bush and the special-interest groups that support the
governor, concentrate mostly on the tactics of the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some power brokers fear our conservative reforms,'' the
senator says. ``They're using every old political trick they can to
fool you about me. But you know the truth. I am a proud, pro-life
Reagan conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Another commercial features a number of voices expressing
support for withdrawing McCain's attack ads. ``His decision to run
a purely positive campaign shows he's a man of confidence,'' a
woman says. A man adds, ``John McCain is drawing people into this
election that have been completely jaded by politics.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a one-sided feel now to the
mean-spiritedness of the advertising, a lot of which can be traced
to the on-air contributions of special-interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is not the first primary state in which outside
groups have run advertisements; in New Hampshire, Bush was the
target of attack ads by both the Sierra Club and the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the commercials running here seem harsher, and the
nastiest may be one being broadcast by a group called the
Federation for American Immigration Reform, which is not aligned
with either candidate. ``Ask the candidates if they think one
million immigrants a year are too many,'' the announcer advises,
``because some imports are just too expensive.''

HAYES LEADS BUT WOODS IS LURKING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (rk) 
 By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. _ Rain-softened fairways at Riviera
Country Club gave players the opportunity to lift, clean and place
their balls Thursday. The only question was why Tiger Woods, the
world's hottest golfer, did not shoot lower than 3--under 68 during
the first round of the Nissan Open on a course that surrendered
birdies to anyone with enough patience to wipe the mud from their
irons.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Hayes set Thursday's early standard, carding a bogey-free
7-under 64, which put him one stroke ahead of Robin Freeman and two
shots ahead of four players who included Freeman's brother, Jeff, a
club pro. Ordinarily, the Freemans would have made for a sweet,
homespun story about their sibling rivalry back in St. Charles, Mo.
``I kept looking up at the leader board and saw him go 3-under,
4-under, 5-under,'' said Jeff, who shot 66 and was tied for third
with Neal Lancaster, Mark Brooks and Bob Tway, ``and I said, gosh,
I can't let him beat me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsworthy, perhaps, but these are extraordinary days on the PGA
Tour. And no matter which round is being played, leader board
watching centers on Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's putting golf in places it hasn't been,'' said the South
African Nick Price, who was among 10 players at 4-under. ``I think
the interest worldwide has been just what was hoped for. There's a
tremendous amount of interest in my part of the world. It's found
its niche thanks to what Tiger has done lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods found his comfort zone early, teeing off on No. 1 at 8:03
a.m., reaching the 503-yard par-5 with a 3-iron for his second shot
and two-putting for an easy birdie.
</P>
<P>
   On No. 2, he sank a 15-footer for another birdie, which
threatened to send Tigermania back toward critical mass. Woods'
only mistake was a three-putt bogey at No. 6, before he added a
25-foot birdie putt at No. 7 and dropped a 12-footer for his final
birdie at the par-3 14th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm only four back, but it really doesn't matter that
much,'' he said. ``It's just a matter that I shot under par, which
I'm very pleased about. Right now, I'm not really worried about the
weekend. I'm worried about getting myself into position to where if
the weather turns bad, that I don't have to go out there and play a
miracle round to try and catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm right in the ballgame. It's where I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods does not enjoy too many fond memories of this tournament.
Two years ago, he lost a one-hole playoff to Billy Mayfair at
Valencia Country Club north of Los Angeles. As a 16-year-old
amateur in 1992, Woods played his first pro tournament at Riviera.
Although he missed the cut that year, he gave a preview of the
excitement to come on No. 1 and No. 2, lipping out a long eagle
putt and saving par from deep in the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about some of that in the pro-am, but not today,''
Woods said of Wednesday's pro-am. ``I was out there focused on what
I had to do. I had a few key things I needed to think about with my
swing.''
</P>
<P>
   He then offered a list of what he planned to work on at the
practice range: his hip-turn, the flex of his right knee, the
position of the left arm at the top of his backswing, his left
wrist and making sure he stays behind the ball at impact.
</P>
<P>
   Perfection is clearly not as simple as Woods makes it look.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the whole package right now,'' Brooks offered. ``The
way he keeps improving, he could keep going until he gets bored of
beating us. Sure, he could get beat any week, but it's going to
take guys who are playing great, inspired golf.''
</P>
<P>
   There is hope, though. According to Lancaster, the two par-5s on
Riviera's back nine, No. 11 and No. 17, are not automatic birdies,
even for Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Par is 68 for him on every golf course,'' he said. ``But on a
course like this, we stand more of a chance because he can't reach
all the par-5s.''
</P>
<P>
   A closer look at Woods' scorecard revealed pars on both holes
Thursday.

SPORTS COLUMN: HOOP DREAMS AND REALITY, THE COLLISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a 1979 recruiting visit to Albany, Keith Glass, a former
assistant basketball coach at UCLA, was asked a favor by Sam
Perkins' guardian: Would Glass drive the blue-chip prep star across
town, to his home, in a vicious snowstorm?
</P>
<P>
   Glass knew his innocent and seemingly innocuous deed was against
National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, but he told Perkins
to hop in his rental car anyway. The ride was deemed a recruiting
infraction by the NCAA, the UCLA program was penalized, and Perkins
wound up at North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so ashamed of that violation; it's just going to haunt me
for the rest of my life,'' Glass said Thursday in a phone interview
from New Jersey, his voice thick with sarcasm. ``Honestly, if I had
to give Sam Perkins a ride home in that snowstorm again, I'd do it
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass is on the other side of the fence today. He is a sports
agent, competing for clients like Erick Barkley, the St. John's
sophomore who was grilled by NCAA investigators about his alleged
contact with agents _ and the favors and gifts that come from those
associations.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jarvis, Barkley's coach, has belittled the NCAA as if it
were made up of beat cops more concerned with a double parker than
with a real menace to the neighborhood. Go ahead and include the
street agents posing as Amateur Athletic Union coaches, the people
who put their hooks into these kids during the summer and won't let
go until they turn pro. You can even take umbrage with
underclassmen like Barkley, who may be naive in some ways but
clearly understand how the agent game is played:
</P>
<P>
   Play well, and someone professing to know what you're about
comes around and earns your trust. Says you're better than you are.
Makes you feel good about yourself. Preys on your insecurities
about money and the care of your family.
</P>
<P>
   Until, finally, that young, impressionable kid says: ``Enough
already. I'm going to the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   And the cycle begins anew. Predominantly black young men viewed
as a commodity because they can play basketball, sucked into a
vortex by people claiming to represent their best interests. These
talented players sometimes emerge wealthy, but they rarely come out
of the cycle squeaky clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I called up Mike Jarvis and he agreed to have me sit down
with Erick Barkley after the season, Mike would be naive to believe
that meeting would give me an opportunity to represent him,'' Glass
said. ``That's how it works. There are street agents and regular
agents who will tell these kids whatever they want to hear right
now. Everybody is looking for the quick hit. That's the reality,
but no one wants to deal with that. They'd rather look at the last
person in the door and take them on.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass added: ``That's like saying Billy Hunter or the Dallas
Mavericks are morally responsible for Leon Smith,'' referring to
the rookie who tried to kill himself last November by swallowing
250 aspirin. ``Where were his parents and his educators? Aren't
they to blame?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association held a technology summit
last weekend in San Francisco. Before the All-Star Game, Internet
billionaires like Mark Cuban, the Mavericks' incoming owner,
Shaquille O'Neal and Commissioner David Stern discussed the
emerging cyberworld, employing language like broadband and other
terms that barely resonate with anyone outside the techie
community.
</P>
<P>
   It made you wonder if the league understood that its sport was
ailing. Has anyone given serious thought to a basketball summit, a
weekend think tank about how to fix this system? Bring in the angel
Mike Krzyzewski and the outlaw Jerry Tarkanian and put them on the
same panel. Bring in Sonny Vaccaro, who funnels young, talented
players to agents and universities while running Adidas' premier
national basketball camp. Ask Vaccaro why he insists on telling
teen-agers, emotionally and mentally unprepared for the NBA, that
they should be shown the money today?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had conversations with the NCAA and the NBA, trying to
get people to all come together and do what's best for the sport of
basketball,'' said Isiah Thomas, the owner of the Continental
Basketball Association. ``As opposed to talking about just business
opportunities, the goal would be to move it to a higher ground and
do what's best for these kids. No one seems interested right now.
They want to talk business, but not much else.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens at St. John's, Barkley is hardly the problem.
The problem is a corrupt system in desperate need of repair.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to upgrade your sport utility vehicle or give a
kid a ride home in a snowstorm to understand that. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Three men seized by Russian troops and imprisoned at a
detention camp in northern Chechnya this winter have told human
rights observers of beatings, torture and rapes they say took place
there before they bribed their way to freedom this month.
</P>
<P>
   The three, who are now in the neighboring Russian province of
Ingushetia, gave their accounts to researchers for Human Rights
Watch, which relayed them to news organizations this week.
</P>
<P>
   One of those researchers, Peter Bouckaert, said in a telephone
interview from Ingushetia's capital, Nazran, that the accounts were
collected separately and appear ``highly credible.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin spokesman for war issues, Sergei Yastrzhembsky,
denounced the reports Thursday as lies spread by a biased foreign
press. Although international observers have not yet been allowed
to enter the camp, at Chernokozovo in northern Chechnya,
Yastrzhembsky said he saw no problem in arranging visits there
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's acting president, Vladimir V. Putin, ordered the
nation's top immigration official Thursday to serve as a special
representative to examine charges of human rights violations in the
war.
</P>
<P>
   The latest accusations came from men arrested on Jan. 16, 17 and
18 as part of a general roundup of Chechen males by the Russian
military. Russia had earlier barred all Chechen males between the
ages of 10 and 65 from leaving the province, saying they were
potential terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Each man said that he was taken by truck to the Chernokozovo
camp, about 30 miles north of the capital, Grozny, where several
hundred men and a few women were being held.
</P>
<P>
   In statements read by Bouckaert, one man identified as Waha, 38,
an engineer, and another called Ruslan, 21, said they were forced
from the trucks and made to run a gantlet of about 15 Russian
soldiers who kicked them and beat them with rubber truncheons. Both
said that sporadic and sometimes severe beatings continued through
their imprisonment. Both men said they were forced to surrender
their belongings, jewelry and money, most of which was not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   And both said they were forced to stand for hours in crowded
cells, with their hands above their heads. Prisoners who sat or
lowered their hands were beaten, they said, and at times the cells
were sprayed with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Waha said that ``16 of us were put into one cell'' about 11 feet
by 16 feet. ``We were made to stand with our arms raised from 3
p.m. to 1 a.m. the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   The smell from human waste, he said, was overpowering. ``If we
wanted to go to the bathroom, we had to do it in the cell,'' he
said. ``We didn't even have a bucket to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Waha and a third man, identified only as Ali, 24, were briefly
imprisoned together. One told Human Rights Watch that he heard the
pleas of a 42-year-old woman named Raisa, imprisoned alone nearby,
as she was severely beaten for 15 minutes and then raped.
</P>
<P>
   The two men also described separate instances in which, they
said, they heard the screams of two men who apparently were being
raped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterwards, the victim said to them, `You have killed me,'''
Waha said. The soldiers, he said, replied that he now had a new
name: ``They said `You will now be Alla, a woman.'''
</P>
<P>
   The second man, Ali said, was forced by soldiers to answer to
the name Fatima after his assault.
</P>
<P>
   All three captives said they were freed from the Chernokozovo
camp after their families tracked them down and paid bribes of
between 1,000 and 4,000 rubles, or about $35 to $140.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to independently verify such reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds pretty severe,'' Bouckaert``But
considering that we interviewed three people who gave very similar
testimony, these testimonies actually appear quite credible.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, refugees, former prisoners and war victims have
given reporters and human rights groups many new accounts accusing
troops on both sides of the Chechen conflict of torture, summary
executions, rapes and other abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations high commissioner for refugees, Mary
Robinson, has released a statement expressing ``deep regret'' at
Russia's refusal to permit her to visit sites inside Chechnya. But
at his regular briefing Thursday, Yastrzhembsky denied that
Robinson had been barred from the war zone, saying instead that
such requests must be processed by the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   He specifically denied that any human rights violations had
occurred at the camp, one of at least four inside Chechnya.
Yastrzhembsky said that 744 Chechens have been held at Chernokozovo
and that all but 235, including 16 women, had since been freed.

TRAILBLAZING CRAFT EXPOSES AN ASTEROID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., Calif.)   (af)  
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The asteroid Eros, now under the constant gaze of a
satellite from Earth, appears to be both composed of dense material
and battered by many ancient collisions, scientists reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft NEAR, which on Monday became the first to orbit
an asteroid, has revealed a rocky surface covered with craters,
ridges, long grooves, large boulders and some surprisingly bright
areas that appear to reflect an unusual amount of light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work is just starting, but it's already clear that Eros is
much more exciting and geologically diverse than we had expected,''
said Dr. Andrew F. Cheng, the project's lead scientist at the Johns
Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., which
manages the mission for NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng, speaking at a NASA briefing outlining initial results,
said that the asteroid, a peanut-shaped object measuring about 21
miles long and 9 miles wide at its fattest point, is a moonlike
gray color with a yellowish tint. He said the asteroid appeared to
have layered, stratified features, which could indicate that part
of it once melted while part of a larger body, something probably
the size of the moon or smaller that broke up during the early
formation of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are also tantalizing hints that it has a layered
structure, as if it were made up of layers like in plywood,'' Cheng
said of the early data from NEAR, which stands for Near Earth
Asteroid Rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Bell of Cornell University said the spacecraft's
near-infrared spectrometer, which analyzes reflected light for
clues to chemical composition, indicated that most of the
asteroid's surface is covered with pyroxene and olivine, iron and
silicon-bearing minerals commonly found in meteorites and molten
rock.
</P>
<P>
   Better information on the chemical history will come later in
the one-year mission, he said, when the spacecraft moves to a
closer orbit and uses other instruments that can detect
below-surface components.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of the asteroid revealed several bright patches of
lighter colored, unidentified material on the surface. Scientists
said this material, which reflects almost a third more light than
surrounding areas, could be subsurface material ejected from impact
craters.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the spacecraft into orbit and keeping it there are not
simple, said Dr. Donald Yeomans of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in California. Eros, with a gravitational pull only one-1,700th as
much as that on Earth, is the smallest object ever orbited by a
spacecraft, requiring the satellite to operate at unusually slow
speeds to stay within the asteroid's gravitational grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Yeomans said the spacecraft approached the asteroid at only 22
miles per hour before breaking rockets placed the craft into a
280-by-200-mile orbit, where it travels at only 2 mph, the speed of
a walking man. By comparison, the space shuttle travels in
low-Earth orbit at 17,000 mph, and satellites in high orbits that
stay above one point on the planet move at 6,700 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Working with such a low-gravity object presents many challenges,
Yeomans said. ``If someone on Earth weighed 200 pounds, they would
weigh about 2 ounces on Eros,'' he said. ``If I could jump three
feet on Earth, I could jump a mile on Eros and almost go into
orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   The irregular shape of the asteroid and these low speeds mean
that engineers have to be very careful as they lower the spacecraft
closer to Eros in coming months for more detailed readings. The
satellite's orbit will go down to 30 miles or below only after the
spacecraft better defines the asteroid's mass and gravity
variations caused by the irregular distribution of this mass.

EDITORIAL: BILL CLINTON'S ASIAN ITINERARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, Feb. 18: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since 1978 no American president has visited South Asia, a
region with one-sixth of the world's population. For that reason
alone, President Clinton's planned trip to India and Bangladesh
next month is long overdue. Conspicuous by its absence on the
presidential schedule, however, is Pakistan, where a military coup
last October has ted tensions with India. Pakistan is now
warning that a snub by Clinton could worsen tensions even further.
But the president is right not to stop in Pakistan unless it makes
tangible progress in returning to civilian rule, cracking down on
terrorist groups and working with India to curb their dangerous
nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Since India and Pakistan exploded nuclear weapons in the summer
of 1998, the United States has played a constructive role in
reducing tensions between them. But an effort to persuade both
countries to sign a treaty banning nuclear tests has lost momentum
recently. Last summer, Pakistan's involvement in the incursion of
insurgents into the disputed Indian state of Kashmir nearly led to
a full-scale conflict. The military coup in October increased
distrust, and India has accused Pakistan of complicity in the
hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has been lobbying hard in Washington to induce Clinton
to visit. Supporters of Pakistan warn that a snub would only
undercut American influence and encourage Islamic radicals in the
region. They even assert that President Jimmy Carter's decision to
bypass Pakistan during his 1978 trip to the region encouraged the
Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan. These arguments are speculative
and ultimately unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference on Wednesday, Clinton said a final
decision about going to Pakistan would be based on whether such a
trip promised to contribute to stability in the region. That is the
right criterion, but the bar should be high. A visit would make
sense only if it can lead to significant steps on nuclear restraint
by India and Pakistan. Pakistan has pledged to do more to stop
Islamic extremists from waging war on its soil. Concrete steps in
this area might also justify a trip. Gen. Pervez Musharraf,
Pakistan's leader, must also speed up his timetable for a return to
democracy and do more to assure due process for former Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, who has been charged with kidnapping and
other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has been engaged in trying to ease tensions in the
Middle East, Northern Ireland and other troubled regions of the
world, would clearly like to add South Asia to his list of
interests. At his news conference he all but offered to get
involved in helping to end the conflict over Kashmir. Pakistan
welcomes such a step, but India insists on direct negotiations with
Islamabad, with no intermediaries. In the four days he plans in
India, Clinton is to visit several major cities and broaden
America's contacts with the world's most populous democracy. A trip
to Pakistan without concrete progress would send the wrong signal
to other trouble spots about the seriousness of American opposition
to military coups and reckless intervention in the problems of a
neighboring country. &QL;

CAN O'NEAL KEEP UP FREE-THROW SUCCESS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ That Shaquille O'Neal is suddenly a 78 percent
free-throw shooter is no fluke. It's also not guaranteed to last,
if history is a guide.
</P>
<P>
   In seven-plus seasons of often-foul foul shooting, O'Neal has
had numerous mini-surges, like his current 32-for-41 stretch. But
they never last, and the 59.2 percent he shot as a rookie for the
Orlando Magic in 1992-93 stands as his best season. The Los Angeles
Lakers center has hovered between 48 and 55 percent since.
</P>
<P>
   But this three-game hot streak could be different. It could be
signs of a permanent change, as O'Neal himself has implied.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a larger sampling: Over the last nine games, dating to
Jan. 24, O'Neal has made 64 of 97 foul shots _ 66 percent. And that
matches the general time frame that coach Phil Jackson says O'Neal
began developing a new approach, with help from assistant coach Tex
Winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a step-by-step program he's going through that hes
following. That's really one of the keys, is he's found one rhythm
and he's found a routine,'' Jackson said, estimating O'Neal started
three or four weeks ago. ``He's found that on his own, and Tex has
worked with him, as far as encouraging him to continue with his
rhythm and his technique. But he found a technique that worked for
him, and that's the success.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal won't say what he's doing differently, but he appears to
be following the same routine at the line each time -- in contrast
to the past, where no two free throws looked alike. The shots still
have little arc, but they're also going up softer.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I) really, honestly believe that a lot of it has to do with
the fact that he's mentally approaching his shooting at the
beginning of the game,'' Jackson said. ``He's always said he could
make critical free throws. Now he's taking them critical from the
very first one on. ... So I think his attitude towards his
free-throw shooting has just turned around and made the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   It could spell doom for overmatched opponents, whose only option
has been to foul O'Neal intentionally, an option that will backfire
if O'Neal has indeed turned the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can do that, he's going to be unstoppable,'' said
teammate Brian Shaw, who also played three seasons with O'Neal in
Orlando. ``You have to foul him or he'll score 50 or 60 points on
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting words: Magic coach Doc Rivers defended the honor of his
host city after Jackson _ in a light moment earlier this week _
referred to Orlando as a ``plastic'' city. Jackson was commenting
on whether free agents this summer would sign with the Magic or the
Chicago Bulls, two teams that have cleared loads of salary cap
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just Phil being Phil,'' Rivers said. ``When you think
about L.A., that's when you think about plastics, in a lot of ways.
Who knows what Phil's motives are. He was in Chicago, and maybe he
was trying to ge some brownie points, because he left them for
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between us and L.A. is that people live in L.A.
because they have to work there. People come to Orlando as a
choice.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The board of The New York Times Co. has nominated an
executive and a psychotherapist for election as directors at its
annual shareholders meeting April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Those nominated were Dr. David E. Liddle, a partner with U.S.
Venture Partners and a retired chairman of Interval Research Corp.,
and Jacqueline H. Dryfoos, a psychotherapist in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger, who is 76, is retiring from the board.
</P>
<P>
   Liddle, 55, retired from Interval Research in January and joined

DALLAS DOES IT RIGHT WITH ITS PICK TO LEAD OLYMPIC BID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitting over here on our end of Interstate 30, the smugness is
hard to hide. We know if we ever need anything from the city of
Dallas, it's an easy buy. Like a city councilman. They come cheap
over there.
</P>
<P>
   And with the burial this week of a true legend, have you noticed
who has currently ascended to the position of Dallas' most
high-profile sports citizen?
</P>
<P>
   It's a tall guy, speaking through lip rings and a tongue-stud,
telling the nation he wants to climb into the ring and do combat
with another man _ naked.
</P>
<P>
   It does make us all appreciate that 36 miles of separation.
</P>
<P>
   But there was an announcement this week which truly summed up
where the city of Dallas stands when it comes to sports leadership.
</P>
<P>
   It's this Dallas 2012 thing. The thing to bring the summer
Olympic games to North Texas. The thing that normally would cause a
personal yawn, because when it comes to getting anything done in
sports, Dallas is the Can't-Do-City.
</P>
<P>
   But this project, despite the name, is not just about Dallas.
Plus, it's well financed by many business interests across North
Texas. What had been lacking, however. was a true leader capable of
bringing it all together.
</P>
<P>
   Who you gonna call? Nobody in Can't-Do-Dallas, that's a given.
</P>
<P>
   That call, of course, went to Arlington. One of us has been
chosen to lead them. It figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have just a long-shot chance of the 2012
games coming to our region,'' Richard Greene said. ``My view is
`Why not make us the favorite?' But that's me being me.''
</P>
<P>
   Need something done from a civic standpoint, or otherwise? Then
you do want Greene being Greene.
</P>
<P>
   As the dynamo former mayor of Arlington, Greene finally left
office with an exemplary record of achievement. For one thing, The
Ballpark in Arlington would never have been built without him.
Today, that ballpark is a national model for how a public-private
partnership should work.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Dallas 2012 Committee launched a nationwide search
for the person to be president and CEO of the organization, some 50
to 60 names were compiled.
</P>
<P>
   Except the committee never got past the first interview. That
was Greene, who since leaving the mayor's office had served as the
vice president and associate publisher of the ``Arlington
Star-Telegram.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have asked what I missed most about not being
mayor,'' Greene said. ``My answer was not having the opportunity to
pursue those things which only come around once in life. Well,
that's what this job is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene didn't apply for the job. He even mistakenly thought the
first interview in December was to seek his opinion on top national
applicants. As it turned out, he was the only candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job is immense because the project is immense,'' Greene
said. ``But once it became clear the committee wanted me, my
excitement hasn't ended since.''
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who originally attempted to ignore the local
Olympic endeavor as frivolous, Greene's hiring was an eye-opener.
Particularly if you've witnessed Greene's persuasive powers.
</P>
<P>
   But even before this hire, Dallas 2012 was gaining strength as
one of eight candidates among U.S. cities/regions.
</P>
<P>
   For that, thank Tom Luce, who, yes, is a Dallasite (I didn't say
they were all worthless over there.)
</P>
<P>
   When the bribery scandal broke around Salt Lake City's winning
bid for the Winter Olympics, corporate sponsors started to yank
grass-root-level support for Olympic bids in many cities.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Olympic Committee saw that as a dreaded trend.
But instead, here came Luce, showing the USOC a long and impressive
roster of Fortune 500 companies from across North Texas _ all of
them were ready to go not only with financial support for Dallas
2012, but also by loaning employees to the project.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, this region has emerged as one of the favorites
for 2012.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the eight regions, none are odds-on to win this thing,''
Greene said. ``It's very wide-open, which is good for us. Like one
of our drawbacks is the heat, but the other seven all have their
flaws, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, the list of positives, Greene says, that can
give North Texas the advantage. ``Let's just say we stack up very
favorably with any other region,'' Greene added.
</P>
<P>
   It's not certain a U.S. city will receive the 2012 bid, but in
an unspoken rotation system by the IOC, that would be the time for
the Summer Games to return to this country.
</P>
<P>
   In some opinions, the early favorites in the process are
Tampa-Orlando in Florida, Washington-Baltimore and North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, none of this would have been happening locally if an
ordinary citizen from Arlington, Grady Hicks, hadn't submitted the
region's bid back in 1997, after first convincing city officials to
back him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Arlington's Grady Hicks, we have come a long way,''
said Greene.
</P>
<P>
   But that's typical. We lead. They follow. nn

JUDGE TO LET DIALLO JURY CONSIDER OPTIONS TO MURDER CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The state judge presiding over the trial of the
four police officers charged with murdering Amadou Diallo said
Thursday that he would accept a request by prosecutors and defense
lawyers to add lesser charges to the two counts of second-degree
murder each officer faces.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling means that the jurors will also be able to consider
the lesser charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter and
criminally negligent homicide during their deliberations. Should
the officers be convicted, the minimum penalties they could face
range from 15 years to life for second-degree murder to probation
for criminally negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing arguments from both the prosecutors and the
defense, Justice Joseph C. Teresi of state Supreme Court also
finalized the legal instruction he will give jurors when they begin
deliberating on the case next week. Defense lawyers won the
language they wanted on several crucial points, and said afterward
that they were pleased; Eric Warner, the lead prosecutor, did not
appear to be.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi said that he would present the jury with two statutes
from New York penal law on when the use of deadly force is
justified. All four officers have testified that they believed
Diallo had a gun and was firing on them or planning to when they
shot him. Nineteen of their 41 bullets struck him.
</P>
<P>
   One of the statutes, Section 35.30, says that a police officer
is justified in using deadly physical force to defend himself or a
third person if he is in the course of making an arrest or
preventing an escape from custody.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had argued that the statute was not applicable
in this case because the officers had said they merely sought to
question Diallo, not arrest him, when they approached him outside
his apartment building in the Soundview section of the Bronx on
Feb. 4 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi will also instruct the jurors on another statute, Section
35.15, that permits the use of deadly force, and is applicable to
any citizen. The statute says that a citizen may use physical force
if he ``reasonably believes'' it is necessary to defend himself
from attack.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had sought to bar parts of the statute that
allow the use of deadly physical force when a citizen believes
another person is in the process of committing a crime like as rape
or robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Sean Carroll testified that he believed Diallo was
either a push-in robber or a rapist when he and the other officers
_ Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy and Kenneth Boss _ tried to
question Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi, however, did say that the officers must be judged on the
standard of what the ``average reasonable person'' would do, rather
than on what a ``reasonable police officer'' would do.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling essentially gives jurors two different ways in which
they could find the officers' conduct justified. It also means that
the jurors will not be instructed that the officers had a duty to
retreat if they could do so safely, which most citizens must do.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi also acceded to a defense request to explain state law on
the authority police officers have to approach citizens and request
information. The lawyers for the officers hope that if the law
makes clear that the police have the broad authority to do so,
jurors will not be distracted by weighing whether the officers
should have approached Diallo in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had originally planned to ask the judge to instruct
jurors that they must find every act of deadly force _ meaning each
shot fired _ justified. But as testimony in the trial made clear,
it is virtually impossible to determine which officers fired which
shots, or when in the barrage the fatal shots occurred. In this
instance, then, the number of shots fired appears to have worked to
the officers' advantage.

EDITORIAL: A NEW UNIVERSE IN MANHATTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, Feb. 18: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saturday is a day to celebrate the completion and opening of the
Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space
at the American Museum of Natural History. The architecture of this
new installation is so invigorating, and the imaginative outreach
of the science it presents is so all-engulfing, that it reframes
our sense of the museum itself. The most eloquent summary of the
museum's achievement will be the look on the faces of children _ a
vast, continuous tide of children over the years to come _ as they
leave the new Hayden Planetarium, stunned by a virtual trek from
Earth to the edge of the observable universe, and begin their walk
down a spiraling Cosmic Pathway that leads them from the Big Bang
to the immediate now.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Center reasserts the role of the Museum of Natural
History as a place where primary education and advanced research
intersect. It has to be said again and again just how fresh the
image of the cosmos presented here really is. Thanks to a
remarkable array of tools, chief among them the Hubble telescope,
we now have an unprecedented sense of the universe's origin, its
rate of expansion, its structure. Our new sense of cosmological
dimension is graphically depicted at the Rose Center in a series of
size analogies using the Hayden Sphere as a point of reference.
</P>
<P>
   We are lucky to live in an era graced by such a wealth of new
astronomical and cosmological knowledge, a time when our conception
of the universe takes us to the limits of strangeness and yet
promises to surpass those limits again tomorrow and the day after.
Portraying the outlines of that knowledge is a daunting task. Doing
so in a way that will engage a scientifically illiterate general
public is enormously hard. The wonder of that glass-enclosed sphere
on West 81st Street is great indeed. But its real test is whether
it will be able to transpose ignorance into enlightenment, to turn
incredulity not into wonder or faith but into a collective sense of
the scientific enterprise, an activity that is completed only when
its results reach the minds and intuitions of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   The new Rose Center for Earth and Space reminds us that human
curiosity and inventiveness have driven us to this revolutionary
new understanding of our cosmos. But it also reminds us what a leap
is needed to step from the welter of our daily lives into a place
where the scale, in time and space, of everything we know about
everything can begin to impress us. There is so much knowledge, so
much beauty at the Rose Center, such a rendering of what was
unrenderable until only recently. And yet amid those striking
images of deep space, of galaxy clusters and newly forming stars,
it is a shock to realize, looking up into the dome of the new
planetarium, that they are no more beautiful than the sight of a
deep night sky seen just as humans have always seen it, until we
turned on the lights. &QL;

GORDON, ONCE TOP DOG, IS DAYTONA UNDERDOG
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ A Winston Cup Series overall champion at
age 24. Two more Winston Cup titles in the next three years. That
was the distinctive swath that Jeff Gordon was cutting through
NASCAR. Then suddenly he blew a tire on his fast track to
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon won seven Winston Cup races last year, more than anybody,
but there were two troubling developments. His valued crew chief,
Ray Evernham, bolted in late September to spearhead Dodge's entry
into NASCAR. And after two quick victories following that
departure, Gordon did not finish higher than 10th in his final five
races. He wound up sixth in points.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the first Winston Cup race of the new year on Sunday,
people here for the Daytona 500 are wondering if Gordon can
recapture the magic that he and Evernham produced: 47 victories in
five years, including the Daytona 500 in two of the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The new crew chief is Robbie Loomis, who left Richard Petty
Enterprises after nine years for the chance to work with Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure a lot of people doubt us,'' said Gordon, who, by his
own account, got stale last season after a spectacular 1998 that
saw him win 13 races. ``But we've got a team that really is
enjoying working together. I think Robbie is just the guy we
needed. I told him right off the bat: `Don't treat me like a
three-time Winston Cup champion. Treat me with some respect, of
course, but don't ever be reluctant to tell me what I need to
hear.'''
</P>
<P>
   Loomis said he must learn what Gordon is thinking during races.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can tell me what the car's doing and he can tell me what
he's feeling, and I can make changes based on that,'' Loomis said.
``But it's those things he's not saying is what a crew chief has to
figure out. You've got to be able to get inside a guy's head.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why some think it may take a year before the Gordon team
can challenge again for the Winston Cup. Loomis even believes it
might not necessarily be a bad thing for Gordon's No. 24 Chevrolet
to struggle some early this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to grow, you have to go through hard times,'' he said.
``A lot of times, what happens is when you start out, things go
pretty good, maybe not as good as they need to, and it's hard to
get to where you need to until you go through some hard times
together.''

 &HT;    How Bush got out-Bushed
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONWAY, S.C. _ In so many ways, on so many days, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona has turned out to be the Republican presidential
candidate Gov. George W. Bush was supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was supposed to be a new kind of Republican, a
``compassionate conservative'' who could unite the GOP's
conservative and moderate wings, then appeal to a broad range of
voters in November. Then came McCain, campaigning as a Republican
populist who could rally independents and build new coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush faces a crucial election day Saturday in South Carolina,
he finds himself cast as the old guard, the party insider, the
right wing _ even though he and McCain are virtually identical on
the issues. And McCain has become many things Bush was supposed to
be, not only on policy and politics, but on personality and style.
</P>
<P>
   The preconceived Bush path to the White House led down the more
moderate center of the Republican Party, a strategy designed to put
Bush in the political middle where most of America lives. The goal
_ typified by positions such as refusing to promise to appoint
judges who share his opposition to abortion rights _ was to avoid
the wide-right veer some believe is necessary to win the GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The centrist strategy worked well for a while. The right-wing
candidates faded away. Pat Buchanan, gone. Dan Quayle, gone. Gary
Bauer, gone. Steve Forbes, gone. With all the candidates who
painted themselves as the true conservative alternative to Bush out
of the race, a new candidate with the true conservative tag
emerged: Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to that position because McCain, pitching campaign
finance reform and building a coalition that includes
non-Republicans and takes advantage of open primaries in early
states, became what Bush was supposed to be: the atypical
Republican attracting new faces to the party. McCain drew them in
unpollable numbers in New Hampshire, which he won by a surprising
18 points, and is trying to rally them here.
</P>
<P>
   It has left Bush hoping for the kind of relatively small turnout
Saturday that would mean only real Republicans are voting in the
GOP primary. But because South Carolina Democrats are not holding a
primary _ they will choose delegates by caucus next month _ and
because South Carolinians do not register by party, the GOP primary
is open to all comers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats and Independents CAN vote in Saturday's primary!''
McCain's literature proclaims. Independents are flocking to his
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, has used South Carolina to shore up
support from party loyalists. He picked up Quayle's endorsement and
spoke at Bob Jones University upon arrival, an appearance he was
still defending Thursday. The university, a Christian
fundamentalist school that prohibits interracial dating, is not the
best venue for a candidate who boasts about how well he ran among
Hispanics and African-Americans in the 1998 gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it was merely an exercise in talking to voters and had
nothing to do with endorsing the school's policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't aware of the interracial dating policy before I
walked in there,'' Bush said Thursday, noting that he denounced the
policy when asked about it after the speech.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has not been invited to Bob Jones. But if he were, McCain
has said, he would say, ``Look, what you're doing in this ban on
interracial dating, is stupid, it's idiotic, and it is incredibly
cruel to many people.''
</P>
<P>
   The final certification of Bush as the conservative he was never
supposed to be came last Sunday when he was endorsed by Christian
Coalition founder Pat Robertson, who said he would never back
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's status as the candidate Bush was supposed to be also
shows up on personality. Bush, as affable a politician as there is,
was supposed to be the candidate with whom you'd most like to have
dinner. Even folks who think he is not the brightest bulb in the
fixture as well as those who don't agree with him issue by issue
acknowledge the affability factor.
</P>
<P>
   But it's McCain who seems more at ease with himself on the
stump, pops the irreverent one-liners on his campaign bus and has a
life story compelling enough for Hollywood, which has bought the
rights for his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has surpassed Bush as the perceived darling of the
media. For months, people complained that Bush was getting a free
ride from the press. By last week, McCain had become a cover boy
several times over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great sucking sound you hear is the media's lips coming
off of John McCain's (behind),'' Marvin Bush, the governor's
brother, said on a South Carolina campaign flight.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has worked to steal Bush's thunder as a positive
campaigner. As he did in his two gubernatorial races, Bush entered
this battle promising to run a ``hopeful, positive'' campaign in
which he would not attack his opponent. Both had negative ads up
for awhile. McCain dropped his. Bush, accusing McCain of starting
the attacks, did not. Regardless of who started it, Bush now is the
only candidate with TV ads attacking his foe.
</P>
<P>
   In the end _ again somewhat improbably _ McCain is having some
success at portraying Bush as something he was never supposed to
be: a Washington insider. Though he's been in Washington for 18
years, McCain's trademark campaign finance reform issue, combined
with Bush's big money and big-name endorsements, have allowed the
Arizona senator to position himself as the outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reminds people that he lives in Austin, not Washington. But
he is genetically challenged in trying to portray himself as an
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are the son of a former president just once removed,
it's impossible to claim you're the outsider,'' said University of
Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.
</P>
<P>
   As the primary season builds toward its crescendo, McCain also
has chipped deeply into something else that was supposed to be
Bush's franchise: November electability. A New York Times/CBS News
poll released Thursday shows that Bush, who soared in earlier
polls, is now disliked by as many people who like him. McCain's
favorable ratings are triple his unfavorables. The poll shows that
voters do not link Bush with any set of policies.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, as well as in the overall battle to be played
out in coming weeks, Bush may win and he may lose. But regardless
of how it comes out, he can no longer become the kind of candidate
he was supposed to be.

 &HT;    McCain at zero hour
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Traveling with a candidate often is the worst
place in the world to try to get perspective on him. Reporters are
taught to be wary of crowds, to take with a grain of salt the
enthusiastic response of a candidate's most fervent supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But when 1,500 Clemson University students turn out to listen to
a 63-year-old man tell a bunch of corny jokes on a Wednesday night,
something is going on.
</P>
<P>
   When a couple of Democrats who oppose John McCain on virtually
every social issue take their lunch hour to cheer him on in
Greenville, S.C., something is going on.
</P>
<P>
   When more than 1,000 Atlantans wait in line for hours on a cold
Sunday afternoon to get McCain's autograph, something is going on.
</P>
<P>
   And the polls reflect what the traveling press sees on the
ground. The one-time dark horse is now running with the leader, at
least in the early states.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, advisers to McCain and George W. Bush say
their polling shows the race is a dead heat and voter turnout in
Saturday's primary will make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   McCain leads Bush 43 percent to 34 percent in Michigan, which
has a primary three days after South Carolina. The Detroit News
poll conducted last week has an error margin of 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, which holds its primary the same day as Michigan,
the news is even better for McCain. An Arizona Republic telephone
poll conducted Saturday through Wednesday shows McCain with 52
percent and Bush 29 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus
or minus 3.4 percentage points. In October, the newspaper's poll
showed Bush leading McCain 40 percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush still has a comfortable though shrinking lead in national
polls. But McCain's strategy was to concentrate on New Hampshire _
which he won convincingly _ and then on South Carolina, believing
victories in those early states would begin to undo the Bush
campaign and translate into support elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   McCain supporters point to Michigan, where McCain has campaigned
little, as evidence the strategy is working.
</P>
<P>
   And support for McCain is building outside the early-primary
states, partially fueled by something past insurgents like Gary
Hart did not did not have _ the Internet. Online, McCain has raised
more than $5 million and attracted 115,000 volunteers across the
country. Since New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary, McCain has raised
$3.5 million via the Internet, campaign manager Rick Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   This achievement hardly compares to the massive organization and
resources of his front-running rival, but it is more than anyone
expected a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   How long this surge will continue is unknown. A defeat Saturday
in South Carolina could begin to turn the tide.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, McCain is involved in a Republican
nomination struggle the intensity of which has not been seen in 20
years, when Ronald Reagan challenged President Ford.
</P>
<P>
   For a look at what's fueling some of that intensity, here are
reports from Cox Newspaper listening posts across the country:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: AURA OVER ISSUES?
</P>
<P>
   It sometimes seems the McCain campaign is a case of aura over
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Suzi Bergsman was standing in the Peachtree Battle Shopping
Center parking lot Sunday, along with more than a thousand other
people who have come to have McCain sign copies of his book ``Faith
of My Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   She is more liberal than McCain on social issues, including
abortion. But she does not accept McCain is as opposed to abortion
rights as he says he is and his voting record indicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came to his family, he said it's an individual's
choice. He said it would be a family decision,'' Bergsman recalled
McCain saying in January.
</P>
<P>
   Told that McCain supports a constitutional amendment to ban
abortion in most cases, Bergsman said, ``I'm pro-choice, but I'm
not a litmus-test voter.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bergsman offered again why she likes McCain: ``You know
where he stands,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people who file through the book store for an
autograph and a brief word with McCain are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   John Sours, McCain's Georgia chairman, is not surprised. He has
been inundated by telephone calls since his candidate won the New
Hampshire primary. About a third of the callers are Democrats, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy has excited more Democrats than anyone since Ronald
Reagan,'' Sours said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those former Reagan Democrats currently enamored of
McCain is Wayne Merisotis, an Atlanta attorney. ``He is the
strongest candidate the Republican party has offered since Dwight
David Eisenhower. He is a man of heroic proportions,'' Merisotis
said of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The staunchest Democrat in the line may be Lawton Bowling, a
retired psychiatrist from Marietta who has not voted Republican in
more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this Roosevelt Democrat is supporting McCain because he does
not think the Democrats will take on McCain's favorite bogeyman,
the ``special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fact is, I don't think they'll do anything to hurt them,''
Bowling said. ``And I want them hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mark Sherman
</P>
<P>
   OHIO: A SPECIAL TIE
</P>
<P>
   David Ford, volunteer chairman of McCain's presidential campaign
in Ohio, has a special link to the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   From 1967 to 1973, they were both prisoners of war in North
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``John has got 30 days longevity on me,'' Ford said. ``And I
told him he can keep every one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford and McCain met when the peace agreements were signed and
they were released from their cells in Hanoi. McCain was
characteristically irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we just slammed each other because we were both
Irish,'' Ford recalled. ``He calls me the shanty Irishman. I call
him the lace curtain Irishman.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford retired from the Air Force in 1984 as a lieutenant colonel.
He had never been involved in politics _ until McCain's campaign
called in November and asked him aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first comment was `I know nothing about politics.' They
said, `You know how to organize.' I can do that, absolutely,'' Ford
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, Ford has been working full time, without pay, to
build a network of McCain supporters throughout the state. McCain's
national co-chairman, U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, has provided
invaluable help, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   And recently, those efforts have picked up. Ford says he's
gotten as many as 200 e-mails a day, and in one 36-hour period he
received 87 phone calls. He estimates McCain's team now has about
1,000 volunteers, organized in Ohio's 19 congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that activity translates into votes remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   State party leaders and election officials said they have not
seen much evidence of a significant crossover effort in advance of
the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Clark County Republican Party Chairman Dan Harkins said party
leaders are more focused on local races, ``but from what I'm
hearing they're pulling for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But longtime McCain supporter George M. McCann, a 77-year-old
retired pharmacist and World War II veteran in Springfield, said,
``I don't know anybody sending contribution checks at this point,
but the people that I talk with are just amazed at what has
happened. I think that a lot of people are having their minds
changed that probably last March would have thought that McCain was
a voice crying in the wilderness.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: DESPITE LONG ODDS ...
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who won 68 percent of the vote in his 1998 bid for a
second term as Texas governor, isn't in any danger of losing the
March 14 primary in his home state. But McCain backers in the Lone
State State, like those across the country, say their candidate has
gotten a large boost from his victory in New Hampshire and the
closeness of the South Carolina race.
</P>
<P>
   ``My e-mail and my phone mail are just filled up _ it's amazing
what this is doing,'' said Hylan Lyon, an executive at Marlow
Industries, a high-tech company in Dallas. Lyon, who was a
classmate of McCain's at the Naval Academy and a pilot during the
Vietnam War, is heading the McCain effort in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republican party of Texas should be glad this is
happening because it's bringing people in who haven't been involved
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice-weekly meetings in Dallas that used to draw from 10 to 20
people now draw 40 to 50, according to Lyon. He traces the
increased interest to ``a basic human desire to not be cynical
about the government.''
</P>
<P>
   There are groups of McCain supporters in every major Texas city,
he said, but he couldn't say exactly how many of them there are.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Binder, a former Austin City Council member who is
organizing McCain supporters in the capital, said many of them are
former Bush backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them don't like the tactics he's using, the way he's
changed since he left Texas,'' Binder said, referring to Bush's
attacks on McCain in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Binder said Texans supporting McCain are Republicans, Democrats
and independents who are attracted by the senator's war record and
his interest in reducing the influence of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's the only one who is across the board trying to stop
big money from controlling the decisions in Washington,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the long odds, Binder wouldn't discount the possibility
of a McCain victory in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got a good chance. I talk to more people who say
they're for McCain but they don't want to say it here in Bush
country,'' Binder said. ``There are a lot of people who are talking
Bush but are going to be voting for McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   If the McCain surge seems to have reached Dallas and Austin, it
is not registering in some other Texas locales.
</P>
<P>
   In Waco, M.A. Taylor, McLennan County's GOP chairman, said he
hasn't heard many people talk about the sudden jump in media
attention to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He's not sure at this point what to believe and what not to
believe. ``I don't have any real good feel for what's happening,''
he said. ``Talking like a poker game, McCain was pretty much on his
last spade and he gambled and laid it all on the line in New
Hampshire, and it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he wasn't aware of any local increase in
contributions to McCain's campaign. A Waco retiree says he can't
understand why the outcome of one state's primary should affect the
way another state votes, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along I don't care how the people in South
Carolina vote, I'm gonna vote for Bush,'' Walter Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   But about 60 miles from Waco, Helen Dozier, GOP chairwoman of
Bosque County, said she believes the Republican establishment is
getting antsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people are taking it a little bit like, 'Let's
see what happens in South Carolina.' I don't think a loss there
would kill Bush, but it would certainly make his work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Marshall, in East Texas, seem to be either
unfamiliar with McCain or in favor of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Bush person,'' said Guinlyn Nash, owner of a local book
store. She said she chooses not to listen to the media's claim that
McCain is a threat to Bush's nomination. ``I'm just not swayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Antiques store owner Frank Shumaker, a registered Democrat, said
that as an ex-veteran he has respect for McCain as a prisoner of
war, but the negative campaigning has turned him off.
</P>
<P>
   And he said Democrats and independents registering as
Republicans to try to secure the nomination for McCain isn't fair.
``It seems to me to go against the whole theory of politics,''
Shumaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Will Hagle, a senior at East Texas Baptist University and a
native of Hallsville, said he doesn't like McCain, ``mainly because
he's running against Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   He often watches the candidate debates, along with his roommate
and college friends, and at this point he's not too worried about
McCain's victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think New Hampshire's messed up anyway,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON: THE `REAL FEAR'
</P>
<P>
   Ed Henry, a co-editor of Roll Call, a Washington newspaper that
covers Capitol Hill, was holding court in one corner of the
bleached wood bar at the swanky George Hotel, playing the McCain
``what-if'' game, a favorite pastime in a company town where
politics often takes on the manner of a parlor game.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time the ``what-if'' question was not whether George
W. Bush would choose John McCain as a vice presidential running
mate, but whether McCain would choose Bush as his.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if it flips and even though they hate each other, Bush
has to accept the VP nod for the party?'' asked Henry of the
Washington politicos gathered to celebrate the launch a new
political Web site. After all, LBJ and Kennedy hated each other, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Or what if McCain has to select a governor because 44 of the 55
Republicans in the Senate have snubbed him in favor of Bush?
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture. The buzz is high on McCain, mainly because
reporters admire him for standing up to the Republican leadership
on issues such as tobacco and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's real fear, real fear that the Republican
machine is going to beat him,'' said Arianna Huffington, a
Republican columnist and commentator. ``Their determination to beat
him is the final proof that our system is really broken. McCain is
about removing the corruption and that is why the people love him
and the senators don't.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sununu, a former governor of New Hampshire who is backing
Bush, seemed less concerned about McCain's prospects for the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Republicans are saying it's a shame that he's not
espousing Republican principles,'' Sununu said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get Sununu wrong. By his book, McCain runs a good
campaign, having captured the primary in the state Sununu once
governed. But as Sununu sees it, McCain simply rewrote the play
book of ``See me, touch me, feel me'' politicking, which was
drafted by others.
</P>
<P>
   What about McCain's chances?
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's volatile vote market, anyone can beat anyone
else,'' Sununu said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate and House aides mingling at the get-together said the
word is out on the Hill to let the media know about McCain's famous
temper and reasons why he shouldn't be president. In other words,
spin as many anti-McCain tales as they can. All anonymously, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a genuine hatred on the Republican side of McCain,''
said Tony Blankley, Newt Gingrich's former press secretary. ``Among
the reasons why they don't like him is the media likes him. And
that goes to the old saying: The friend of my enemy is my enemy.''

   COLORADO: A MORAL DILEMMA
</P>
<P>
   McCain poses a moral dilemma for Pete Hautzinger, a deputy chief
district attorney and chairman of the Mesa County Democratic Party
in Western Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Hautzinger hopes the Arizona senator loses the
presidential primary because he thinks Bush is more beatable in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   But, like unaffiliated voters and even some Democrats across the
county, Hautzinger is intrigued by McCain's upstart campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me would like them to nominate someone who I think
would be a pretty darn good president, and that's what McCain's
starting to look like to me,'' Hautzinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Mesa County residents haven't quite decided which
Republican they will support in Colorado's March 10 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure respect (McCain) but I'm not sure if I'd vote for
him,'' said John Pritchard, a Steve Forbes supporter who has also
contributed money to McCain and Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,200 volunteers are working for McCain in Colorado,
said Barbara Masonheimer, state coordinator for the McCain
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying that they don't like that Bush was anointed,''
Masonheimer said. ``They don't like being told what to do.''

   CHEYENNE, Wyo. _ The nation's record economic expansion has left
most states so flush with tax revenues that lawmakers argue over
how to spend a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Not here.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Wyoming's elected officials are debating how large
the budget deficit could become and what services might be cut if
dramatic new measures _ including taxes _ are not passed to raise
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone say new taxes? That's almost incomprehensible to
people in Wyoming, who pay no personal income tax and, overall, a
lower percentage of their income in taxes than residents of any
other state. That's why many of them live here.
</P>
<P>
   But Wyomingites are not alone in confronting difficult choices.
While many Americans are growing wealthier and Congress debates how
much of the federal surplus should be returned to taxpayers, a
handful of states are facing choices that more commonly arise
during recessions. Their lawmakers are deciding whether to raise
taxes or cut spending because their state economies are not
diversified enough to reap the full benefits of the boom or their
tax base is too narrow.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, unstable oil prices and marginal increases in tax
revenues have left the state facing a potential deficit of $540
million for the fiscal year beginning in July, state officials
said. Mark Drennen, the state's commissioner of administration,
said that spending caps and cuts, including the dismissal of
recently hired state employees, could offset much of it.
</P>
<P>
   But a remaining deficit of $275 million, he said, would require
new revenue sources, including the possibility of a new business
tax, which is supported by Gov. Mike Foster, or a penny increase in
the 4 cent per dollar sales tax. Other possibilities are a
reduction in the state homestead exemption and an increase in the
personal income tax.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, Gov. Don Sundquist has been fighting for more than
a year for tax changes to help cover increased spending in
education and other areas. After the Legislature rejected his
proposals last year, he tried again this year with a package that
includes a 3.75 percent flat-rate income tax. He challenged
lawmakers to adopt his plan, find other new revenue or cut spending
by $342 million.
</P>
<P>
   A slow rate of economic growth in Iowa caused by depressed farm
prices, nearly full employment, a lack of new industries and an
aging population, forced Gov. Tom Vilsack to cut $30 million in
spending from the current fiscal year's budget of $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a lot of room for growth if you are not able to
add new jobs, and that affects the revenue base,'' said Randy
Bauer, the Iowa state budget director.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same factors forced the Kansas Legislature to reduce
its current budget of $4.45 billion by $65 million. ``Actual
revenue collection came up short of revenue forecasts, and that is
what caused us to go back and reduce the level of spending,'' said
Duane Goossen, the state budget director.
</P>
<P>
   No state faces a more precarious economic situation than
Wyoming, the least populated state with just 479,000 people, about
the population of Denver. It is one of only seven states with no
personal income tax and one of four with no corporate taxes, major
sources of the windfall in other states.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, almost two-thirds of Wyoming is owned by the
federal government, which means only a small part of the state
budget comes from property taxes. The largest single source of tax
revenues is from mining, as much as 60 percent in some years,
followed by revenues from sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials say Wyoming has grown too reliant on global
markets for commodities that are found in vast abundance around
Wyoming, including natural gas, coal and minerals like trona, which
is used to make soda ash, and bentonite, an absorbent clay.
</P>
<P>
   When natural gas prices are booming, for example, Wyoming's
budget is stable. The only reason the state is not facing a deficit
for the fiscal year beginning July 1 _ after deficit projections of
$127 million a year ago and $183 million six months ago _ is a
recent surge in coal prices.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of gyrations have forced state leaders to cut many
programs, like services for the elderly, from the state's $4.1
billion two-year budget. They have also prompted Gov. Jim Geringer,
a second-term Republican, to lead efforts to wean the state off the
uncertainties of volatile markets, arguing that economic growth and
full service delivery can come about only through predictable
revenue streams.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been out front on this, with the need to do something,''
said James King, a professor of political science at the University
of Wyoming in Laramie. ``He realizes you can't put a Band-Aid on
this. But whether he can truly get a long-term solution or another
Band-Aid remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his campaign, Geringer has been traveling the state,
selling ``a sense of responsibility'' to people who have grown
accustomed to low taxes. As he said in his state of the state
address this week: ``In order to create a long-term solution, we
must make some difficult choices.''
</P>
<P>
   They may be on the way.
</P>
<P>
   After state lawmakers returned on Monday for the 20-day budget
session that is held every other year, House members approved one
major revenue-raising measure for introduction as legislation, an
extension of the state's 4 percent sales tax, which was scheduled
to expire in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Votes on another proposal, a new tax on services, were held back
until Friday to give lawmakers time to generate more support. But a
raft of other proposals failed, including ones that would have a
created a personal income tax and a tax on electricity production
and separate measures that would have increased taxes on fuel,
cigarettes and property.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in tax-loathing Wyoming, even one new tax is dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an optimist,'' said House Speaker Eli Bebout. ``I think
we're on the path toward long-term solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Geringer said the Legislature was ``a little bit gun shy'' about
adopting long-range solutions. But he held out hope that more
measures would be approved, saying it was just a matter of finding
mutually agreeable approaches.
</P>
<P>
   But even new taxes might not be enough to keep Wyoming stable in
the long run. Other than scenic beauty, recreation and the tax
base, Wyoming has few advantages for prospective residents and
businesses over neighboring western states. Its population has
dropped for four consecutive years though mid-1999. Only one
airport in the state, Jackson's, accommodates commercial jets. A
teacher shortage is looming in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a new state agency, the Wyoming Business Council,
was formed to attract businesses, but some lawmakers are trying to
eliminate its $21 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie A. Ball, a council board member, says that would be a
mistake. A former executive with Macy's who moved from New York to
Cheyenne six years ago to become chief executive of a western wear
company, Ball said the council has already landed eight new
companies, bringing in 800 new jobs, and has prospects for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of obstacles here, but the state is starting
to move a little bit,'' Ball said. ``For the first time in a long
time, all the economic categories are moving. I think the state has
a fairly positive future.''

DERBY HOPEFULS MEET FOR FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ It is still nearly three months and many
adventures away, but the Kentucky Derby cast its spell across the
country's leading 3-year-old horses Thursday when 11 candidates
were entered in the $200,000 Fountain of Youth Stakes, the first
Grade I race for Derby hopefuls in the East.
</P>
<P>
   The race will be run on Saturday at Gulfstream Park with D.Wayne
Lukas returning to the stage with the 3-1 early favorite, High
Yield, followed by Nick Zito and Greenwood Lake (4-1) and Shug
McGaughey with Polish Miner (5-1). They will run a mile and a
sixteenth, but beyond that, they will be aiming for the Florida
Derby and other landmarks on the road to the Kentucky Derby on May
6.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 colts who entered the Fountain of Youth did not include
several superstars, notably More Than Ready, the speedball whose
career began with five straight victories last fall and whose first
race of the year ended in a grinding dead heat with Summer Note in
the Hutcheson three weeks ago. The strain of the race removed
Summer Note from racing for three months with a stretched tendon,
and More Than Ready was removed from the Fountain of Youth Thursday
for a softer spot.
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone. Also absent from the Fountain of Youth will
be half a dozen of the leading candidates in the West, led by
Anees, winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last fall and the
Eclipse Award as the top 2-year-old colt, who has just returned to
training after sustaining a foot injury; War Chant, who has raced
only twice and is being aimed toward the San Rafael at Santa Anita
on March 4, and Captain Steve, the Bob Baffert-trained colt who is
headed for the Louisiana Derby on March 12.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Red Bullet, the prodigy of Frank Stronach's barn
at Gulfstream Park, who will try to become the first horse in a
century to win the Derby without racing at the age of 2. And one of
the strongest fillies in years, Surfside, a daughter of Seattle
Slew trained by Lukas on the West Coast, will try to become the
fourth filly to win the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   She had a close call but won the Las Virgenes last Saturday, but
Lukas said he was committed to her for the Santa Anita Oaks on
March 12, the Santa Anita Derby four weeks later and the Kentucky
Derby four weeks after that. Surfside has won six of her eight
starts and does not seem to be the type who will be intimidated by
colts.
</P>
<P>
   The Fountain of Youth may be the stepping stone to the classics,
but Thunder Gulch was the only horse in the '90s who won both the
Fountain of Youth and the Kentucky Derby. But Lukas flew into
Florida Thursday brimming with confidence about the chances of High
Yield, who flew in from California three days ago with Cash Run,
the likely favorite in Sunday's Davona Dale Stakes for fillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both shipped here for the Breeders' Cup last fall and
handled it well,'' Lukas said. ``So far, they've shipped here and
handled it well this winter. They're both ready, and I'm looking
for both of them to run well,''
</P>
<P>
   High Yield ran third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Gulfstream
Park last November, and Cash Run won the Juvenile Fillies,
outrunning the undefeated Chilukki. So, neither was a stranger to
the track or the climate.
</P>
<P>
   This year's class of 3-year-olds has not yet produced a dominant
horse, or even a leader. And Gulfstream Park was taking no chances
on losing any of the contenders to other tracks, so it raised the
purse of an allowance race Saturday to $75,000 and listed it at a
mile and a sixteenth, the same distance as the Fountain of Youth.
The maneuver drew five colts, four of whom won or placed in stakes
last year.
</P>
<P>
   McGaughey, facing the option of running Polish Miner in the
Fountain or the allowance, elected Thursday morning to run in the
Fountain. His colt won a tough allowance at Gulfstream in his last
start, on Jan. 29, and ran second in the Nashua and third in the
Remsen at Aqueduct in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just galloped him a mile and a half,'' McGaughey said, ``and
I think that's where he belongs. He's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood Lake was keeping a low profile, with redemption on his
agenda. The colt won the Champagne and the Remsen in New York, but
in his debut this year, he ran a dull sixth in the Holy Bull at
Gulfstream Park.

BUSH LEFT IN WANT OF A WAND AS QUESTIONERS LOOK FOR HELP 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. _ For a few seconds, Gov. George W. Bush
sounded less like a presidential candidate than a charity
auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I hear a bidder?'' he asked an audience at Coastal Carolina
University here Thursday afternoon after a partially blind biology
student complained that neither she nor the school could afford
$400 for a device that would enable her to use a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   Someone raised his hand, and the matter was settled. But Bush
had not addressed the student's questions about people with
disabilities, and what lingered was a sense that he and his
compassionate conservatism had been caught short.
</P>
<P>
   It had happened earlier in the day as well, at a campaign event
in Florence. A woman stood to say that her medical insurance did
not cover all the needs of her son, who had a chronic,
life-threatening illness. What would Bush do?
</P>
<P>
   The candidate, who has yet to articulate a comprehensive health
plan, seemed stumped. He sang the praises of medical savings
accounts, then acknowledged that it was too late for the woman to
start one and that he really had no specific remedy for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' he said. ``I wish I could wave a wand.''
</P>
<P>
   The student in Myrtle Beach, Christine Green, 26, was not asking
Bush for charity. Her description of her frustration with not
having certain equipment came in the context of a broader concern
about the government's assistance to disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, whose philosophy often stresses private solutions over
public ones, bypassed the big picture to bore in on this one
detail. He asked her how much the device cost.
</P>
<P>
   She said $400.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet somebody right here in this audience may stand up and
help you,'' Bush predicted. Correctly, it turned out.

WITNESS SAYS TENANT WORRIED MISSING WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A caretaker for an Upper East Side woman testified
Thursday that his employer was worried from the day she rented an
apartment to the man now accused, with his mother, of murdering her
in a plot to steal her $10 million mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Mengistu Melesse, who worked for Irene Silverman
for six years until her disappearance in 1998, described the man,
Kenneth Kimes, as a difficult and suspicious tenant throughout the
22 days he rented an apartment in Silverman's town house under an
assumed name, Manny Guerin. Kimes and his mother, Sante, are on
trial in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, accused of a complicated
plot against Silverman, whose body has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   Melesse said that when he came to work on Monday, June 15, 1998,
Silverman told him to watch the new tenant. ``She said, `Mengi,
there is a young man who moved in yesterday,''' Melesse testified.
```His name is Manny and he looked like he just stepped out of
jail.'''
</P>
<P>
   Melesse testified that Kimes initially refused to allow him into
his apartment to water the houseplants and began entering the town
house in a strange manner. Melesse said Kimes came in and out of
the apartment by slinking along the wall, hiding his face from the
security camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the monitor and said, `Mrs. Silverman, look how he
comes in,' and she said, `Low-class jerk,''' Melesse testified.
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand, Melesse described his last conversations
with Silverman in detail, sprinkling his testimony with asides
about her ``beloved houseplants'' and her ``beautiful boxer,''
Georgie.
</P>
<P>
   Melesse portrayed Kimes as a nervous man who rubbed his hands
together compulsively and lurked by the peephole in his apartment.
He said Kimes peppered him with questions about the staff's work
schedule, tried to get him to slack off and urged him to quit his
job. Melesse added that Kimes referred to Silverman with a
derogatory term.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, which will cross-examine Melesse on Friday,
prevented some of his warnings about Kimes from being shared with
the jury and had the judge strike the caretaker's testimony that
Silverman would sell the house only ``over her dead body.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were allowed to question Melesse about many of his
conversations with Silverman about Kimes. Ann Donnelly, one of the
prosecutors, argued that Melesse's testimony was critical to
disproving the defense's potential argument that the Kimeses were
friends with Silverman and that she wanted to give her house to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows she would not willingly transfer her home to them,
they knew it and there was only one way to get rid of her,''
Donnelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Melesse said that the relationship between Kimes and the staff
grew more tense on June 25, the day before the caretaker was due to
leave for what was supposed to be a two-week vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman confronted Kimes about his true identity and asked why
he had failed to turn in an application that she had given him for
the apartment. Kimes responded first that he had given it to his
lawyer to review, and then said he had given it to another
employee, Melesse said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `That's a lie,''' Melesse testified. ``I saw his
face change, and his ears flushing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Melesse spoke, a few feet away at the defense table, Kimes'
face turned red.
</P>
<P>
   The caretaker testified that after another brief exchange, Kimes
walked off, and Silverman turned to Melesse and called her tenant a
thief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Shhh, he'll listen.' She said, `I don't care, this is
my house, I'll stay in my house, and he'll have to go,''' Melesse
said.
</P>
<P>
   On June 26, Melesse said, he left for his first-ever vacation
and did not speak to Silverman again until he called the house on
July 4 from Atlanta. Silverman told him she was concerned about
Kimes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `I am worried, I want you to come home, I want you
to come tomorrow,''' Melesse testified. ``I said, `I will come back
and protect you.''' But when he called the house the next day, he
said, a police detective answered the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever talk to her again?'' asked Connie Fernandez, a
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Frowning, Melesse answered, ``No.''

BATTLE UNEARTHED INSIDE STAMFORD HISTORICAL SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ It has been the kind of civil trial normally
associated with huge corporations: five weeks of mind-numbing
testimony on bylaws and parliamentary procedure, reams of meeting
minutes and financial statements, and long discourses on dates of
record and proxy votes.
</P>
<P>
   But the proceedings that drew to a close in state Superior Court
here this week did not involve a high-stakes hostile takeover or a
class action by shareholders. Rather, they were the outgrowth of a
fight for control of the all-volunteer board of directors of the
Stamford Historical Society, a 99-year-old organization with at
best 360 members in a corporate mecca hardly known for its
reverence for history.
</P>
<P>
   What was expected to be a three-day trial has turned into a
five-week ordeal, all over an organization whose best-attended
exhibits hang in a local shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the meager prize, passions have only grown on both
sides and are likely to continue simmering in anticipation of the
court's ruling sometime next month. Each side has a team of lawyers
who are preparing their final written arguments, now that the
courtroom theater is over.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of his closing argument Wednesday afternoon, Glenn
A. Gazin, a lawyer for the defendants, seemed to embrace the
absurdity of it all by conceding a central allegation: that the
insurgent group he represents had conspired to take control of the
society by drawing up a list of potential board members to nominate
and approve in a suprise move last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say they did put together a list of 19 people who they think
would be good directors, so what?'' shouted Gazin, a former
magician whose animated features give him a cartoonish quality.
``So what?'' he shouted, throwing his hands in the air and raising
the eyebrows of the judge, William F. Hickey. ``I have been waiting
to say this for five weeks: `So what?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gazin's point was that his clients did nothing illegal. But more
telling about his remark is that no one said ``so what'' sooner,
underscoring that there are real issues at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are valid legal questions about the governance of
nonprofit organizations like the historical society, nonstock
corporations that rarely if ever come to the attention of state
regulators and whose meetings are often little more than a
kaffeeklatsch of old neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the heart of the struggle is a debate over what the
primary mission of a historical society should be.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is Walter Wheeler III, the president of the society,
who sued the insurgents after they tried to oust him. Wheeler, 75,
who has often worn a sweater and bow tie to court, conceded that he
represented the society's old guard, but said they take a modern
view. Recent exhibits have included artwork by public school
students and a display on the history of blacks in baseball in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made this more than a nice old house of antiquities,''
Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side is a group led by Patricia Kane, 56, a
Stamford lawyer who is on the board of directors. A mix of
dissatisfied old members and new members hoping to clean house,
Kane's group say some of the contemporary exhibits have been a
waste of money and that the public rarely gets to see the society's
most prized holdings, including the Hoyt-Barnum House, an
18th-century residence that is seldom open, and a collection of
Federal-period furniture that is mostly locked away in the
society's stone headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Kane and her supporters say Wheeler has depleted the society's
investment fund, which they say should be an endowment and should
not go toward operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about? Mismanagement,'' Kane said. She has produced
a report showing that historical societies in surrounding smaller
towns have larger memberships and healthier finances.
</P>
<P>
   But the issues in court have been far less philosophical,
focusing on whether Kane's group had the right under the bylaws and
state law to nominate new board members from the floor of the
annual meeting then vote them in even after Wheeler adjourned the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In the sort of loud exchange that has been typical in this
trial, Hickey shouted angrily at the lawyers, ``I will not listen
to foolishness,'' then allowed three more hours of incomprehensible
testimony from an expert parliamentarian on Robert's Rules of
Order.
</P>
<P>
   When a witness became tongue-tied, Edward V. O'Hanlan, the
lawyer representing Wheeler, asked her: ``Did you say hysterical
society?'' At another point, O'Hanlan, gripping a copy of Robert's
Rules, shouted, ``This is snake oil!''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping that the judge rules on a strict legal grounds, O'Hanlan
in his summation laid out a careful argument, tied to Connecticut
law on nonstock corporations, that most of the insurgents were not
eligible to vote. Even if Judge Hickey agrees, he could still order
a new vote.
</P>
<P>
   While many have warned that the dispute could kill the society,
some believe there is a silver lining.
</P>
<P>
   ``That it's gone on so long is bizarre,'' said Linda Baulsir,
the society's executive director and one of its three full-time
paid staff members. ``The interesting thing is that the historical
society means something in this town. Whatever the outcome is, it's
proof there is a passion for history.''

<P>
   WOODSTOCK, N.Y. _ The Buddhists on Overlook Mountain are
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   In late December, one of Tibetan Buddhism's highest-ranking
lamas, a 14-year-old monk known as the 17th Karmapa, made a
spectacular flight from his Chinese keepers in Tibet. Ever since,
the monastery here that was designed to be his home in the West has
been filled with joy and anticipation. Its 30 members are expecting
him to visit within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a hope, that's a definite,'' said Bardor Tulku
Rinpoche, one of two high Tibetan lamas at Woodstock. The site of
the monastery, on a wooded slope above the town, in terrain
remarkably similar to the Himalayan foothills that have nurtured
Tibetan Buddhism for centuries, was chosen by the 16th Karmapa
before he died while visiting the United States in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   While the shrine was being built, a boy was born in Tibet in
1985 whom Buddhists later accepted as the Karmapa's reincarnation.
The child, Ugyen Trinley Dorje, was officially recognized in 1992
as the 17th Karmapa, the leader of the Karma Kagyu lineage, not
only by a majority of that school but also by the Dalai Lama, the
leader of all Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
   After fleeing from the Tsurphu monastery near Lhasa, the Tibetan
capital, on Dec. 28, the boy arrived unannounced eight days later
at the exile headquarters of the Dalai Lama in Dharmsala, India. He
said that he fled in part because he had been barred from traveling
outside Tibet to study with older lamas in exile. He has requested
asylum from the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
   No one can be sure how long that will take, but at the Woodstock
monastery, the Karma Triyana Dharmachakra Center, expectations run
high that within a year the young leader will be coming to the
United States as his predecessor did, believing that there is
fertile ground here for Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   The main exile seat of the Karma Kagyu Buddhists is still at
Rumtek, in Sikkim, a Buddhist kingdom annexed by India in 1975. But
the community at Woodstock is prepared to offer the Karmapa an
alternative home, and there are hopes that he will become the first
major Asian religious figure to be based largely in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 16th Karmapa established his main seat in America because
of his vision of the future,'' said Bardor Tulku Rinpoche, a
Tibetan exile who was sent to the United States by the 16th Karmapa
two decades ago. The Woodstock center plans to break ground next
year on a $5 million monastic compound around the existing central
temple, completing the establishment of a major Tibetan Buddhist
center that will be one of the largest outside Asia.
</P>
<P>
   There are some problems to be solved as preparations begin. The
Asian-style couch-bed reserved for His Holiness has been judged too
small already for the strapping 14-year-old youth, whose flight
from Tibet included by most reports a grueling horseback dash
across some of the wildest reaches of Nepal. A new bed will have to
be found.
</P>
<P>
   And there will be crowds. Tibetan Buddhist Web sites are humming
as fascination grows around a vigorous young Buddhist leader who
may serve as a symbol for a younger generation of followers
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a hit record, really,'' said Thomas C.
Schmidt, a jazz musician who has mastered classical Tibetan
religious instruments and now, as a Buddhist, directs music and
recording activities for the monastery. ``He is going to spend a
lot of time here in future years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bardor Tulku Rinpoche, who also teaches at the Woodstock
center's 40 affiliates around the United States, said that many
Americans seem to have ``good karmic connections'' developed
through past lives and deeds. This leads them inevitably to seek
Buddhist teaching in this life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we strongly feel is in the West many of the Westerners
have a very strong karma in the past, and the time has come to
connect,'' he said. They seek a teacher to tap into that past and
release the spiritual store, he added, ``and whatever karma they
have, naturally it comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Westerners are attracted to the meditative practices and
individualistic style of learning through a personal teacher,
hallmarks of Tibetan Buddhism, known as Vajrayana, which set it
apart from two other major divisions of the religion practiced
elsewhere in Asia, Theravada and Mahayana, from which Vajrayana
grew centuries ago. For many, Buddhist teachers say, the reward of
Buddhism is inner peace and better relationships with other people
and all living things.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there is life, there is pain and suffering,''
Bardor Tulku Rinpoche said. ``Eventually people find in the
Buddha's teaching there is a lot of remedy for how to get rid of
pain and suffering, and how to apply happiness to their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inner peace is very important,'' he continued. ``If your mind
has all kind of negative thought, than there is not much peace to
you. There is not much peace you can give to others.''
</P>
<P>
   The center holds classes on weekends that attract dozens of
Buddhists and students of Buddhism. School groups also make trips
to Woodstock to hear classical Tibetan Buddhist musical instruments
and learn something of the religion.
</P>
<P>
   The layout follows a plan traditional to nearly all Tibetan
Buddhist monasteries and could be mistaken for a Himalayan retreat.
Financial support has flowed in from followers around the world.
The Karma Kagyu is thought to be the wealthiest of Tibetan Buddhist
branches or lineages, a factor that many Buddhists say contributes
to a challenge to the Karmapa's legitimacy from a Tibetan lama in
India, Trinley Thaye Dorge. He also has followers in the United
States and Europe but is not recognized by the Dalai Lama or most
major Buddhist figures.
</P>
<P>
   The dazzling central shrine at Woodstock, with its 11-foot tall
golden Buddha image and walls hung with religious paintings known
as thangkas (pronounced TONG-kas) mounted on fine brocades, was
finished first, about 15 years ago. Its brilliantly colored and
meticulously authentic decorative artwork was done by a Tibetan
master, Trinley Chojor, who is 67 and still in residence.
</P>
<P>
   The shrine, with its central heating and windows open to the
sun, seems a very bright and quiet place, far removed from the dark
dinginess of the Tibetan and Himalayan originals, with their sweet
fog of butter-lamp smoke and the shrieks of scrappy novices
racketing through monastic courtyards in flip-flop sandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tranquil and relaxing around here, which is nice,''
said Trinley Chojor, the seventh generation in a family of artists,
who has painted his way through monasteries across Tibet, Nepal and
India, and who spoke in Tibetan through an interpreter. ``It's
actually a great relief to be here in the tranquillity and freedom
that this country provides, compared with living in Tibet under
Chinese domination. It was anything but peaceful and tranquil in
Tibet.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael A. Doran, a former student of Eastern religions who is
now a Buddhist and secretary of the monastery, said that the young
Karmapa had recently written a millennium prayer for peace for his
followers that included ``a kind of strange line'' that has been
interpreted here as a message that he was coming.
</P>
<P>
   It said: ``May auspicious excellence, prosperity and goodness
flourish, especially throughout the land of America. May the
youthful lotus of teaching and practice bloom.''
</P>
<P>
   Doran said that when the Woodstock community discovered that the
Karmapa had fled Tibet virtually while they were reading his
prayer, followers began to interpret the ``youthful lotus'' that
could bloom here as the Karmapa himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's announcing that he's going to be here,'' Doran
said. ``As Bardor Tulku Rinpoche has said, `This is not an
accident: the karma is right in American for his presence.'''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The death of a patient has prompted the state to
order Staten Island University Hospital to stop its chief of
neurosurgery from treating other patients, five years after the
same doctor was fired from another hospital for operating on the
wrong side of a patient's brain, a state Health Department
spokeswoman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinarily strongly worded letter to the hospital's
chief executive, the deputy health commissioner, Dennis P. Whalen,
said the state had received information of a ``potentially grave
risk to patients.'' He said there was ``an immediate and serious
threat to the health of any person subjected to surgery'' performed
by the doctor, Ehud Arbit, and directed the hospital to force him
to stop practicing medicine there, pending the outcome of its
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials would not comment Thursday night. State
officials would not specify the nature or extent of the
investigation at the hospital. A state Health Department
spokeswoman, Kristine Smith, said a patient, whom she would not
identify, died following brain surgery performed by Arbit earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1995 case, at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in
New York, Arbit's patient survived.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit did not return calls to his office about the state's new
action. A woman who answered the phone there said, ``This all has
nothing to do with Dr. Arbit.''
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Barbara Ryan, said that she could not comment on the
state's actions. ``The cases under review are subject to patient
confidentiality laws,'' Ryan said. ``There are not any allegations
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``There is no cause for concern for any of the care
or treatment that this doctor has rendered.''
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department last investigated Arbit beginning in 1995,
when he was chief of neurosurgery at Memorial-Sloan Kettering. He
mistakenly operated on the healthy right side of the brain of
Rajeswari Ayyappan, the 59-year-old mother of a famous Indian film
star, Sridevi Ayyappan, instead of the left side, where a cancerous
tumor was situated, health officials said. The error left the
patient with little memory and unable to recognize family members.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department rebuked the hospital and fined it $16,000,
the maximum amount permitted, for eight violations of regulations
on health care that it said contributed to the error. The state
decided that Arbit's actions warranted a one-year probation, which
allowed him to continue practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   It is common for doctors who have been dismissed from one
hospital, even when they have been disciplined by the state as
well, to gain work at other health care centers. Even in cases
where doctors lose their medical licenses, they often move to other
states and find work.
</P>
<P>
   Two doctors dismissed from Beth Israel Medical Center after the
death of a gynecology patient, Lisa Smart, in 1997, were later
hired by Staten Island University Hospital. One of them, Dr. Robert
Klinger, maintains an office there even though he is not treating
patients because the state suspended his medical license in the
Smart death, for what it determined was ``gross negligence.'' When
the suspension ends in a few months, he will be on probation and
his privileges at the Staten Island hospital will resume.
</P>
<P>
   After the Sloan Kettering case, Arbit became the chief of
neurosurgery at the Staten Island hospital. Contacted several times
this week, the hospital spokeswoman, Arleen Ryback, said she knew
of no inquiry into Arbit or the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The state's letter to Staten Island University Hospital, dated
Tuesday, is highly unusual both in its language and its action. It
is likely a precursor to further departmental measures against the
doctor and possibly the hospital. In rare cases, the department
seeks to suspend doctors' licenses temporarily or gets them to stop
practicing medicine while it completes its investigation, if its
officials believe that a doctor is a danger to patients.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, state officials moved quickly as a protective
measure, the department spokeswoman, Smith, said. ``We recently
received credible information that would lead us to believe that
patients undergoing surgery by Dr. Arbit face potential risk,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In its report in 1995, the Health Department found that Arbit
had confused the identities and X-rays of two patients with Indian
names. One was Mrs. Ayyappan, the other a man, and their tumors
were on opposite sides of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ayyappan had come to the world-famous center from Madras,
India, two months after she was told by doctors there that her best
chance of surviving the malignant tumor was surgery in the United
States. After the operating-room error was discovered, Mrs.
Ayyappan went to New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center to have
the tumor removed.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Dr. Barbara A. DeBuono, then the state health
commissioner, said in the state's report: ``What disturbs me most
is that at no time prior to entering the operating room did the
surgeon or other members of the surgical team review the patient's
medical history, diagnostic reports, or CAT scan films _ things
that we in the medical community assume occur on a regular basis.''
The hospital vowed to take steps to correct things that contributed
to the error.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit appealed his firing by Sloan Kettering but lost.

MEDALS AND RISK SHOW THAT LUGE IS NO JOKE

<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ Despite their deepest wishes, Gordy Sheer
and Chris Thorpe know that the two-man luge is the Rodney
Dangerfield of winter Olympic sports. Luge, the odd Nordic sliding
sport, seems even more peculiar when done by a two-man team, both
on their backs, one atop the other, wearing lycra suits and
helmets.
</P>
<P>
   The sport is one of several that will be contested in the 2000
Winter Goodwill Games, the first cold-season version of the Ted
Turner made-for-television sports event, which began with an
opening ceremony Wednesday night and competition here Thursday. An
elite field of more than 250 athletes from 20 countries will
compete over five days in figure skating, snowboarding, ski
jumping, speedskating, bobsledding, and Alpine and Nordic skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Past Olympic and World Cup standouts include the figure skaters
Oksana Baiul, Nancy Kerrigan, Katarina Witt, Victor Petrenko, Brian
Orser and Brian Boitano; the freestyle skiers Ann Batelle and Eric
Bergoust; the snowboarder Tricia Byrnes; and the cross-country
skiers Justin Wadsworth and Marcus Nash.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation-only competition has even lured back into
competition the figure skater Dorothy Hamill, the 1976 gold
medalist. Household names aside, Turner Broadcasting is hoping to
cash in on some of the more obscure winter sports at the Goodwill
Games, the first world-class multisport event to be staged in Lake
Placid since the 1980 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   While luge is becoming less obscure, the lack of respect for
two-man luge occasionally finds its way into Jay Leno's nightly
monologue. Grin and bear it, the veteran sliders say. Of course,
winning helps, as the Americans Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin
could surely attest after winning Thursday''s doubles final. And it
does not hurt being the first U.S. lugers to win an Olympic medal,
say Sheer and Thorpe, who finished fourth Thursday but own the
silver medal from the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to laugh,'' Sheer said of the negative asides about
his sport.
</P>
<P>
   As any eyewitness knows, luge is a sport for the skilled and
truly fearless. Lugers ride a small metal and fiberglass sled,
sliding feet-first down a banked ice track at speeds approaching 90
mph.
</P>
<P>
   The taller athlete in this case, Thorpe, who at 6 feet 2 inches
and 186 pounds has 4 inches and 30 pounds on Sheer, is called the
top driver, and he lies on top and a little forward of the bottom
driver for aerodynamic reasons. A race is comprised of two heats
and the winner is determined by the lowest cumulative time, which
is measured in the thousandths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   How significant are the leg, hip, and upper body movements
sliders use to steer their sled down the course while experiencing
five times the force of gravity in some curves? This significant:
Sheer and Thorpe missed a gold in Nagano by 22 thousandths of a
second on a course more than a mile long.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in Lake Placid, where Eric Heiden won five gold medals in
speedskating, and where the U.S. hockey team pulled off its miracle
on ice, Sheer and Thorpe were challenged by more than history.
Beside the American pair, they finished behind Steffen Skel and
Steffan Woeller of Germany, and Christian Oberstolz and Patrick
Gruber of Italy on the state-of-the-art course.
</P>
<P>
   The new $20 million bobsled and luge facility _ only one of
three in North America _ replaced the aging and, according to many
athletes, dangerous former Olympic ice track. It was constructed
just in time for the Goodwill Games: the new ice is only two weeks
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no home team here,'' Thorpe said. ``We're all
learning. The ice is a little bumpy, so it's anyone's race.
Frequent and heavy snowfall has also played havoc with track
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheer's and Thorpe's silver at Nagano was no fluke. They won the
overall World Cup title the year before Nagano, the first
non-European sledders to take that title.
</P>
<P>
   Lugers like Sheer and Thorpe are often described as adrenaline
junkies, but there is apparently a limit to sustaining that need.
With the Salt Lake Winter Olympics quickly approaching in February,
2002, they do not know if they will be able to muster the energy
and will to train for two more years. They have already been at it
for 12 years, by their count.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know now what it will take to go fast and win another medal
in Salt Lake,'' Sheer said. ``We just don't want to do it
halfheartedly.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that after years of living out of duffel bags, both
men crave some normality in their lives. Sheer, 28, of
Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., recently earned a bachelor's degree in
communications from Ohio State that took eight years to complete.
He will marry next month and relocate permanently to Lake Placid.
Thorpe, 29, originally from Waukegan, Ill., is still a few years
away from finishing his college degree.

MCCAIN OPENS UP BIG LEAD IN ARIZ. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JON KAMMAN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain and Al Gore hold commanding leads in their Arizona
presidential primary contests, and McCain would be the overwhelming
favorite if the general election were held now, the Arizona
Republic Poll indicated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing George W. Bush by 4 points in late October,
Arizona's senior senator is sprinting to the finish line in his
home state with a 23-point lead, 52 percent to 29 percent, over the
Texas governor, according to the poll conducted for ``The
Republic'' over the previous five days.
</P>
<P>
   Former Ambassador Alan Keyes was the choice of 3 percent of
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week before the Republican primary, McCain is now
supported by about half the state's registered Republicans. Last
fall, he posted a 36 percent showing against Bush's 40 percent in
the newspaper-sponsored poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 808 registered voters, conducted by telephone
Saturday through Wednesday by Precision Research, had an overall
margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But given the margin of error of 4.7 points for the sampling of
423 Republicans alone, Bush would have a chance of winning
Tuesday's primary only if virtually all 16 percent of undecided
Republicans tilted to his side.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, leads former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley 55 percent to 25 percent, or more than 2-1, in
Arizona's Democratic race, to be decided March 11. The margin of
error for the sampling of 266 Democrats was 6.3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Gore's support would evaporate, however, if he faced off
against McCain for the presidency right now, according to the poll
of all 808 registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   In that hypothetical race, McCain holds a lead of 45 percentage
points, 67-22, with 11 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would fare even worse against McCain, a 71-15 percent
defeat, with 14 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush headed the Republican ticket, he, too, would beat either
of the Democrats right now, the poll said. He would have a 47-36
advantage over Gore and a 50-32 lead against Bradley, with other
voters undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen percent of poll respondents were registered as
independents or in other parties.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the
poll. &QL; 
SPINNING THE RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Brenda Burns, R-Glendale, a McCain supporter,
said she has always felt sure he would win Arizona and now sees a
win Tuesday as ``the launching pad for his victory on March 7,''
the so-called Super Tuesday primaries in 11 states.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of Arizona's primary will have the backing of all 30
of the state's delegates to the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokesman in Arizona, Jay Heiler, said he was not
surprised to see McCain with a strong lead in his home state after
being ``cradled like a newborn babe in the arms of the media for
the past two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is cause for concern to the McCain campaign that
his support continues to hover around 50 percent in his own
state,'' Heiler said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the outcome of Saturday's primary in South Carolina,
where Bush and McCain are reported in a dead heat, will influence
voters in Arizona, and ``the race remains fluid here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull, a strong Bush supporter who has said that McCain
would have to win Arizona by 30 or more points for it to be
meaningful, ``still doesn't expect McCain to win by a landslide on
Tuesday,'' spokeswoman Francie Noyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the poll's respondents described themselves as
having a middle-of-the-road political orientation, with 38 percent
conservative and 14 percent liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Another finding was that Arizonans are more inclined to vote
Republican in November than they were last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three percent of all respondents said they intend to vote
for the GOP presidential candidate, compared with 41 percent last
October. The Democratic candidate has the support of 29 percent
now, with the remainder undecided or divided among other parties. &QL; 
WHAT THEY THINK
</P>
<P>
   Poll respondents willing to elaborate on their views displayed a
healthy awareness of issues as diverse as gun control, education,
federal budget surpluses and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in our family is for McCain,'' said 30-year
Scottsdale resident Babette Wood, 49, ``mainly because of his
honesty and forthrightness.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said she agrees with McCain's stance on using budget
surpluses largely to pay down the national debt. And she favors
McCain for his military background.
</P>
<P>
   Values are at the core of Dianne Kazenski's support for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the economy is good, but the values of our country I
don't believe are good at all, and are slipping quickly,'' said
Kazenski, 51, a biblical counselor in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Citing McCain's war record, she added, ``I think from that we
see that he's a very strong man, a very persevering man and someone
who would stick by his guns and stand up for what he believes.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps typical of the many Democrats who might abandon their
party's nominee in the fall is Tom Bruner, 65, a Sun City resident
since retiring in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bruner said he likes Gore in the primary ``mainly for his
experience,'' but also because Bradley ``doesn't move me at all,
unfortunately.'' But in November, he probably would vote for Bush,
though not for McCain, Bruner said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Barbara Nelson of Tucson said her strong
abortion-rights stance, along with the feeling that ``things might
go a little bit better with somebody who isn't completely
establishment,'' leads her to pick Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like McCain, but I'm very definitely pro-choice. That's the
only thing I have against him,'' said Nelson, 70.
</P>
<P>
   An undecided voter, 35-year-old homemaker Mary Dunn of Chandler,
said that ``education and getting rid of abortion'' are the two
largest issues for her, and she considers both McCain and Bush
``strong candidates.'' &QL;

NASDAQ HITS RECORD BUT `OLD ECONOMY' STOCKS GO NOWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to adjust numbers for Wal-Mart and Rite Aid.)  
(mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shrugging off the ever more likely prospect of
additional interest rate increases this spring, technology stocks
powered the Nasdaq market to a record Thursday as turnover surged
past 2 billion shares for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index jumped 121.27 points, or 2.74
percent, to 4,548.92.
</P>
<P>
   However, other stocks, particularly those of the so-called Old
Economy, languished once again, with the Dow Jones industrial
average losing 46.84 points, or 0.44 percent, to 10,514.57, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index barely managing to stay in
positive territory, rising 0.59, or 0.04 percent, to 1,388.26.
</P>
<P>
   The latest government report of minimal inflation spurred a
general early rally but Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, soon dampened sentiment with an unusually direct warning
that higher rates would be needed to slow an overheated economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For once, I thought I understood what he was saying _ that he
will continue to increase interest rates until job creation slows
down,'' said Robert Bloom, president of Friends, Ivory &AMP; Sime, an
investment management company. As a result, Bloom added, stocks are
now on the defensive and 2000 is ``a year to try to preserve
gains.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip index, which had been up more than 110 points,
swung to a loss of nearly 107 points at midday and then clawed back
part way in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart and other retailers were once again prominent
casualties; the giant discounter dropping 3 15/16, to 48 15/16, 30
percent below its Dec. 31 peak. Gap lost 6 7/8, to 42 1/8, and
American Eagle Outfitters 4 15/16, to 20 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were also weak, especially American Express,
which sank 5 29/32, to 147 15/16, and was the biggest factor in the
Dow's decline. Bank of New York, at the center of a
money-laundering case, fell 2 7/16, to 35 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   But technology, both in the Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell
2000 _ the latter up 1.95 percent, to a second consecutive record _
was largely untouched by concern over how hard rising rates, when
they kick in, will brake the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, introducing Windows 2000, climbed 2, to 99 5/8;
Intel, 2 13/16, to 110; Qualcomm, 8 1/8, to 130; Cisco Systems, 3
21/64, to 130 1/2; Juniper Networks, 20 3/4, to 241 1/4; and eBay 4
9/16, to 145 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick, though, skidded a second day as the online
advertising company faced a federal investigation into its
collection of data on Internet users. The shares fell 15 3/4, to 90
3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision Systems, the top operator in the New York City area,
fell 2 5/8, to 68 3/8, after reporting a widened fourth-quarter
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid, facing a fraud investigation, fell 5/16, to 6 5/8,
down from more than 45 a year ago.

ANGELS BADLY NEED MORE ARM-AMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can almost hear it now.
</P>
<P>
   It's opening night. Angels vs. the New York Yankees at Edison
Field, and the public address announcer gets his cue:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to Edison Field!
Tonight, your Anaheim Angels take on the World Series champion New
York Yankees! And by the way, the Angels are currently taking
applications for those interested in becoming tonight's starting
pitcher! See the usher at Gate 3!''
</P>
<P>
   It might not be that bad, it only seems like it. Pitchers and
catchers reported to the Angels' spring training camp in Arizona
Thursday, but a familiar face was missing. The Angels lost starting
pitcher Chuck Finley to the Indians via free agency, leaving the
team severely lacking in their rotation.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the goal of new general manager Bill Stoneman to
trade an excess outfielder for a quality starter, but his efforts
so far have gone unrewarded. Jim Edmonds has drawn the most
attention, but is a free agent after the 2000 season and continues
to say through his agent that he is looking forward to exercising
that option.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a number of offers that Stoneman has deemed
unworthy of an All-Star-caliber outfielder. And thus, there have
been no deals. Not unless you count the free agent signing of Kent
Mercker as a noteworthy addition.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman's response to those offers is to insist the team will
be competitive if it must go to Ken Hill (arthritic right elbow),
Mercker, Jason Dickson (coming off shoulder surgery), Tom Candiotti
(age 42) and a group of talented but unproven pitchers including
Ramon Ortiz, Jarrod Washburn and Brian Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied to have them compete for spots, if that's what
it comes to,'' Stoneman said of Ortiz, Washburn and Cooper. ``If
you have talent and I know people have a hard time understanding
the concept but if you have talent I have no problem giving those
types of players an opportunity to compete for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand it, based on our reports, we have talented
players who lack experience. They've got to get over the hump, and
the only way to get them over the hump is to give them the
opportunity to get experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman is quick to point out that there is no trading
deadline. He can make a deal during spring training, which begins
with full-squad workouts on Tuesday, or even after the season
begins.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, rookie manager Mike Scioscia must run camp with the
players he has, whoever they are. Publicly Scioscia has remained
optimistic in the face of so many question marks. He says he
believes better health will be the biggest difference in this
year's team, noting the significant injuries to Mo Vaughn, Edmonds,
Tim Salmon and Gary DiSarcina in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of determining who his starting pitchers will be,
Scioscia will keep a close eye on the second base competition.
There are plenty of candidates for the job, but none stands out as
a clear-cut favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Spiezio, who played for the A's last season, was the only
one signed to a major league contract. Justin Baughman has been
deemed fit to play after having recovered from a badly broken leg,
but it is doubtful he'll have the same speed. Pat Kelly, Jason
Bates, Carlos Garcia and Benji Gil also are in the running.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher is another possible problem area. Benjie Molina will be
given every chance to win the job. He has potential but lacks
experience. Todd Greene's shoulder problems have prevented him from
catching for almost two years, but he may be healthy enough to
serve as a backup, along with Matt Walbeck.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, Scioscia's focus will be on the bullpen and
bench, knowing that the other positions are basically set, barring
a trade. Troy Percival, Mark Petkovsek and Shigetoshi Hasegawa are
solid in the 'pen, but inconsistent Mike Holtz and journeyman Greg
Caderet are the lefties.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is no trade of an outfielder, one of Scioscia's
tasks during the spring will be to learn how to rotate one of the
four or Vaughn through the DH spot and keep everyone happy.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia will be a busy man for the next six weeks. Angel fans
hope Stoneman will be too.

AIDS OFFICIAL SPARKS INQUIRY OVER A GRANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The inspector general of the Department of Health
and Human Services was asked Thursday to investigate whether a
former government health official who recommended a
multimillion-dollar federal research grant involving an
experimental AIDS vaccine violated post-employment restriction
policies by working for the vaccine's manufacturer, federal health
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Heyward, the former chief of the AIDS vaccine unit
at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, denied any
wrongdoing in the allocation of $8 million for research involving
volunteers who take the vaccine known as AIDSVAX. It is the world's
first AIDS vaccine to undergo full-scale tests.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward said he reviewed the CDC's ethical and legal obligations
for former government employees before retiring Dec. 31 after
working for the agency for 20 years. He said that he took terminal
leave for 60 days and that during that period wrote about a dozen
companies and universities exploring job opportunities. On Jan. 3,
he said, he became vice president for international trials of
AIDSVAX's manufacturer, VaxGen of Brisbane, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was well aware of the rules and I have abided by them,''
Heyward said in a telephone interview from his home in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The $8 million grants from the disease control centers were not
made to VaxGen but to university scientists and health workers in
community health departments in six places in the United States,
said Heyward, Nicole Lynch, a spokeswoman for VaxGen, and Kay
Golan, a spokeswoman for the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   The grants are to conduct behavorial research to determine steps
to insure that participants in the AIDSVAX trials understand that
the vaccine might not protect against HIV, the AIDS virus, Lynch
and Golan said.
</P>
<P>
   Golan said her federal agency followed standard procedures in
awarding the grant Sept. 30, after a panel, which included Dr.
Heyward, recommended it July 26.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward said he was one of about 20 people involved in the
recommendation that went through all levels of review at the
centers. He also said he ``had no line-item authority to spend $1''
when working at the centers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Golan said, the centers asked for an inspector
general's investigation to clarify any perception of ethical
impropriety on the part of Heyward or the centers.

CHARTER SCHOOL TO PRESENT CREATIONISM AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO
EVOLUTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., N.C., Kan., N.M.)  (rk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A publicly financed charter school scheduled to open in
Rochester, N.Y., next fall intends to teach students about
creationism as a scientifically based theory competing with the
theory of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has drawn the attention of state regulators and
attracted opposition from community and civil liberties groups,
which contend that it is a thinly veiled attempt to teach religion
in a public school classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester Leadership Academy, which hopes to enroll 436
students in kindergarten through eighth grade, will teach the
science of evolution, said John R. Walker, a Rochester business
professor who sponsored the application for the school. But because
``the theory of evolution is unproven,'' Walker said, the school
``will present contrasting theories,'' including creationism.
</P>
<P>
   Creationism holds that there is scientifically valid evidence
that a divine being created the universe, humans and other species
less than 10,000 years ago. Walker said he did not consider the
presentation of creationism as an alternative scientific theory to
be an unconstitutional promotion of religion.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the approval of the Rochester Leadership Academy,
which will be managed by National Heritage Academies, a Grand
Rapids, Mich., company that operates 22 charter schools in Michigan
and North Carolina, expands to New York a debate that has recently
flared up in other states.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the Kansas Board of Education voted to delete from
the state's science curriculum virtually any mention of evolution,
the theory that all life forms descended from simple organisms over
billions of years. In October, New Mexico's education board voted
to bar the teaching of creationism. The New York curriculum
requires the teaching of evolution but does not mention alternative
theories.
</P>
<P>
   To opponents of creationism, the approval of the Rochester
school raises questions about whether some companies applying to
run charter schools see the explosive growth of such schools as a
chance to skirt constitutional barriers between church and state.
Charter schools are generally freed from many personnel and
curricular regulations.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rochester school, much will hinge on whether teachers
spend significant time in class on creationism as science or simply
note that it is an alternative belief. National Heritage contends
that its teachers in Rochester will mention the existence of
theories opposing evolution, as they do at the company's other
schools, mainly to avoid offending parents who espouse those views
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the law, that you don't teach religion at
school,'' said Walker, an assistant business professor at Roberts
Wesleyan College, a Christian college in Rochester, and pastor of
the Faith Christian Center, a nondenominational church. ``But
basically, evolution is unproven. So we teach it as a theory, and
we teach creationism as a theory. Like with all theories, we say,
`Examine the evidence and decide.' I don't consider that a
religious preference.''
</P>
<P>
   National Heritage has been sued by the American Civil Liberties
Union in Michigan over what the group says is the company's
promotion of religious activities, including prayer sessions for
parents, in a charter school there. National Heritage says it
provides parents with a meeting room and some have prayed there,
but not with the school's sanction. The suit is pending.
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester academy received its charter last month from the
State University of New York's trustees. State education officials
say they will be closely watching the school and have received
assurances that it will not offer any religious content. They say
that merely presenting creationism as a theory does not violate
state or federal law.
</P>

   ``We need to know how they intend to present it,'' said Roseanne
DeFabio, assistant state education commissioner for curriculum.
``If it is as a theory that is held by a number of people, rather
than as a matter of faith and religious belief, then it is not
inappropriate to present it alongside evolution.''

   BERLIN _ The ambitions of Edmund Stoiber, the conservative
premier of Bavaria, to lead Germany have never been much of a
secret. But with the Christian Democratic Union in turmoil, he has
abruptly emerged as a formidable national force.
</P>
<P>
   Stoiber, whose politics stand at the right edge of mainstream
German conservatism, heads a sister party of the Christian
Democrats called the Christian Social Union. Up to now, his party
has managed to avoid the financial scandal ravaging the party of
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   With these credentials, Stoiber has been much in evidence of
late, castigating the Social Democratic chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder, for isolating Austria for including Joerg Haider's
anti-immigrant Freedom Party in a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have insulted the people of Austria,'' Stoiber said this
week. At the time of the Austrian election last year in which the
Freedom Party took 27 percent of the vote, Stoiber was the only
prominent German politician to congratulate Haider and suggest his
party was now eligible for government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Stoiber does not want to be a candidate for chancellor,''
the leading economic daily, Handelsblatt, said Thursday. ``He wants
to be chancellor.''
</P>
<P>
   This evident ambition alarms the governing German coalition of
Social Democrats and Greens, especially at a time when Haider's
success has illustrated the appeal of a nationalist right. This
week, Joschka Fischer, the foreign minister, accused Stoiber of
``playing a role in giving birth'' to the Austrian coalition.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Stoiber saw Haider's electoral success as a
legitimate basis for entering the government, but the Bavarian
leader has at the same time been at pains to say that he ``does not
want anything to do with Mr. Haider politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoiber's domestic position has been considerably strengthened
by the crisis of the Christian Democrats and by the abrupt
resignation on Wednesday of their leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble, who
had been tainted by accepting illegal party financing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the candidates to succeed Schaeuble are in their 40s and
relatively inexperienced, giving added authority to the 59-year-old
Stoiber, who has been successful in making Bavaria one of Germany's
most prosperous states.
</P>
<P>
   Combining a conservative social message that is highly cautious
about immigration with a go-ahead approach to new technologies,
Stoiber has stretched his appeal from young Bavarian professionals
to the state's reactionary traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   He was much in evidence Thursday, doling out advice on how to
choose a successor to Schaeuble. ``We need to take our time,''
Stoiber declared. ``Quality is more important than speed right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``The new party leader must have great powers to
integrate the regions, north and south, east and west, young and
old. And he must above all be able to integrate the liberal center
and the conservative side of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   It was notable that Stoiber used the masculine pronoun ``he'' in
his description of the ideal candidate. He is known to be fiercely
opposed to Angela Merkel, the progressive general-secretary of the
Christian Democrats and one of the favorites to succeed Schaeuble.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Christian Social Union has played a background
role behind its much larger, more centrist partner, the Christian
Democrats. But in 1980, the two allied parties did field a CSU
candidate in the race for chancellor _ Franz Josef Strauss. He lost
to Helmut Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Stoiber has his mind on this precedent at a time when
his partners have never been so weak. ``The chaos among the
Christian Democrats has made the Christian Social Union much
stronger than ever before,'' the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper
commented Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But several potential problems may hurt Stoiber. One is the
traditional uneasiness in the rest of Germany over electing a
chancellor from Bavaria, a very large and overwhelmingly Catholic
state. Another is his recent support for Haider's inclusion in
government.
</P>
<P>
   A third is the fact that Karlehinz Schreiber, the fugitive arms
dealer who gave cash to Schaeuble, is known to have had close links
to the Christian Social Union. He has said he has other secrets to
reveal and has given money to ``other parties'' apart from the
Christian Democrats.
