<HEADLINE> Kenyan Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Minister of State in the Office
of the President John Koech has announced that he resigned from
the Kenyan Cabinet with immediate effect, the "Daily Nation"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Koech, accompanied by his bodyguard, went to the Nakuru bureau
of "Daily Nation" yesterday and wrote an open letter to President
Daniel arap Moi, saying that he had resigned as a minister.
</P>
<P>
He stated that he would give a comprehensive statement next
Monday and stressed that "this is an open letter. I can't change
my mind. I have resigned. I am no longer (President D.A.) Moi's
minister."
</P>
<P>
The daily paper said that the resignation came barely a
fortnight after President Moi pardoned Kipkalia Kones, former
Minister of State whom Koech replaced in January this year.
</P>
<P>
The two politicians from Bomet District have been political
rivals since the election of Kones to Parliament during the last
General Election in 1992 and his appointment to the Cabinet the
same year.

WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration said it would end a ban on
sales of advanced weapons to Latin American countries; the ban
was imposed 19 years ago during an era of military dictatorship
in the region.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. economy entered the summer with fresh strength as
an unexpected number of new jobs dropped the nation's
unemployment rate to 4.8 percent last month, matching a 23-year
low set in May.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Between 10,000 and 75,000 Americans may develop thyroid
cancer because they were exposed to radioactive iodine fallout
from nuclear weapons tests in Nevada during the 1950s and 1960s
when they were children.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States moved to strengthen its economic ties with
oil-rich Azerbaijan. The meeting between President Bill Clinton
and Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyer on Friday exemplified the
strategic decision by the Clinton administration to emphasize
the economic stakes in Central Asia.

<HEADLINE> Boldon Clocks Year's Best in Men's 100m Heats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago ran
a fabulous fast time in the men's 100 meters second round to register
the year's fastest time of 9.87 seconds here Saturday at the 6th World
Athletics Championships.
</P>
<P>
His time is only 0.03 seconds slower than the world record set
by Donovan Bailey of Canada at the Olympics last year. The time is
also Boldon's personal best, 0.02 seconds inside his season's
leading time.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic bronze medallist had said before the race that he
could set a new world record about 9.70 seconds at the meet. With a
blistering form, he is able to do that in the final tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
Mauice Green of the United States, whose best time this year is
9.90, equalled the time behind Boldon.
</P>
<P>
Tim Montgomery of the United States, whose best time is 9.92,
showed he is a strong force in the battle of the world fastest man,
clocked 9.99 in the following heat, ahead of Bailey's 10.10.
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who looked not in his best form, also finished second in
the morning's first round.

<HEADLINE> Taylor Sworn in as Liberian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's Charles Taylor today was
sworn in as new president of the war-ravaged country in the
capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
A valid report monitored here said eight African heads of
state, including Nigeria's General Sani Abacha who is also
chairman of the Economic Community of West African States and
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, were present at Taylor's
inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Monrovians went on a march in the streets of the
capital to celebrate the occasion, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor won a landslide victory in the country's post-war
election on July 19, getting 75 percent of the valid votes.
</P>
<P>
The election, monitored by international observers, was widely
regarded as free and fair.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that Taylor's inauguration brought an end to
the country's seven-year bloody civil war that killed nearly
200,000 people, displaced about a million others and destroyed
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The war began in December 1989 when Taylor launched a rebel
fight against the late President Samuel Doe.

<HEADLINE> Fredericks Clocks 9.99 Seconds in Men's Heats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Frank Fredericks of Namibia, Olympic
silver medallist last year, clocked 9.99 seconds in the men's 100
meters second round here this evening at the 6th World Athletics
Championships.
</P>
<P>
His time is the third fastest in the second round, behind Trinidad
and Tobago's Ato Boldon's 9.87 and American Maurice Greene's 9.90. Tim
Montgomery of the United States also ran 9.99 in front of world record
holder Donovan Bailey of Canada's 10.10. All these big names sailed
into the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
The track looks fast at the newly-built Olympic stadium and
Bailey's world record of 9.84 seems in danger.
</P>
<P>
Boldon, Olympic 100m and 200m bronze medallist last year, is in
splendid form. He would have beaten the record if he had not eased up
in the final strides today.
</P>
<P>
But Bailey was not that good. The Canadian finished second in both
the first and second rounds.
</P>
<P>
Boldon said after the race:"My dream is under 9.80, but certainly I
would be happy with 9.81. I want to see what everyone else is doing in
this round. In the last 10 seconds before the race started, I
concentrated on staying down, keeping my pattern because if I pop out
of the blocks my race is over. That is what I did in Atlanta."
</P>
<P>
The 100 meters final will be held on Sunday, and the world record
is most likely erased by Boldon.

ISLAMABAD, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia were ready to cooperate with the United Nations and
Pakistan in their efforts for restoration of peace in the war-torn
Afghanistan, a senior Taliban official said today.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban also favored the formation of a broad-based
political commission "which should include all Afghan groups,
small and large and not just the Northern Alliance", Muhammad
Ghaus, member of the Taliban Central Shura, was quoted by the
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ghaus, Taliban's former foreign minister, held three-hour talks
with Pakistani Additional Foreign Secretary Iftikhar Murshed who
arrived today in Kandahar, a major city in southern Afghanistan,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The Kandahar talks focused on proposals for a ceasefire,
exchange of prisoners and the establishment of a joint commission
by the warring sides to work out a political settlement, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Murshed, who has conducted his shuttle diplomacy to bring the
afghan warring factions back to the negotiating table, described
Taliban's proposal for the formation of a political commission for
the settlement of Afghan conflict as a "breakthrough."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Condemns Israeli Security Policy on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today condemned Israel's
tough security measures against the Palestinians, saying they
would only worsen the situation.
</P>
<P>
After two suicide bombings killed 14 people and wounded 150
others in a vegetable market in Jewish West Jerusalem Wednesday,
Israel immediately imposed a closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, barring tens of thousands of Palestinians from their jobs
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was worried that Israel's security measures were
counterproductive and went beyond its legitimate security
concerns, said Acting Minister of State for Information Affairs
Nasser Lawzi after a special cabinet meeting to discuss current
situation.
</P>
<P>
Radio Jordan reported today that Jordanian Foreign Minister
Fayez Tarawneh has contacted Israeli and United States officials
to urge Israel not to overdo security measures in the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Such Israeli security measures could only lead to more
tensions, the foreign minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lawzi also criticized the Israeli closure of the Palestinian
territories after the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's suicide bombings have been the newest terrorist
violence in the region since the peace process was stalled in
mid-March this year due to the construction of a Jewish settlement
in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The construction triggered conflicts between the Palestinian
stone-throwers and Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
During the deadlock of the Israeli-Palestinian talks, the
Israeli closures of the Palestinian self-rule area has led to an
increased unemployment and deterioration of the Palestinian
national economy.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt are the only countries in the Arab
world that achieve peace with the Jewish state while both serve as
mediators in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Linguists Call for More Efforts to Cultivate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leipzig, Germany, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Over 250 African
linguists attending the Second World Congress on African Languages
in Leipzig today called on African governments to pay more
attention to cultivate the much-neglected local languages.
</P>
<P>
According to Congress Chairman cultural Wolff, delegates from
more than 40 African nations agreed that the variety of languages
in Africa should be viewed as cultural wealth instead of obstacles
to development.
</P>
<P>
They called on national governments to help provide textbooks
and other teaching materials in as many African languages as
possible. More intensive linguistic studies were also urged to
preserve the 1,200 languages and dialects in use in Africa, most
of which lack a written form or do not have any grammar books or
dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
The congress is due to convene every three years in Africa,
Europe and North America after its launching in Swaziland in 1994.
Leipzig was chosen as the venue for the congress because the
Leipzig University has been teaching African languages since 1895.
An institute for African studies was also founded there in 1993
which now has 130 students.

</P>
<P>
The little-known sprinter hit the tape first in her group with a
brilliant time of 10.90 seconds, the second fastest this year to 10.89
set by Gail Devers of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The hot favourite Marion Jones of the United States, who had beaten
the 11-second barrier five times last month, romped home first in the
third group in 10.96. The former basketball player slowed down her
pace in the final stage, and looked in hot form.
</P>
<P>
With Devers out of the 100 meters, Jones, whose best time this year
was 10.90, is well on course to win her first world title.
</P>
<P>
Merlene Ottey of Jamaica, 37, is still very powerful in the race,
winning her group in 11 seconds. She is the most dangerous threat to
Jones in the 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
The women's 100 meters final is arranged on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Troops Launch Attacks on South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli troops this morning
launched attacks on suspected guerrilla positions of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in southern Lebanon,
but causing no casualties, Lebanon News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The artillery bombardments were targeted at villages near the
city of Jezzine, north of the so-called "security zone" in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The area is believed to be used by the guerrillas as a base for
operations against Israeli soldiers and their militia allies, the
South Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the bombardment, Israeli warplanes carried out
reconnaissnce flights over the highlands of Iqlim al-Tuffah,
which faces the Israeli-occupied border enclave in the south,
military sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Three hours later, the Islamic Resistance, the military wing
of Hezbollah, began to respond to the attack by firing machine guns
and rockets at an Israeli patrol on a road in Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
The attacks between the guerrillas, and Israeli troops and the
SLA take place almost everyday since Israel established a buffer
zone of 1,100 square kilometers in 1985 in southern Lebanon to
protect northern Israel from cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> New Cracks Threaten Defences in Eastern German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- German soldiers and other helpers
worked frantically today to repair several cracks emerged in the
sodden dikes along the flooded Oder River on the border with
Poland to prevent the flooding of thousands of homes.
</P>
<P>
It was described as a miracle for the dikes in the Oderbruch
region of eastern Germany to be able to withstand the
unprecedented high water levels for the past 15 days. The dikes
were designed only to hold floodwaters for three to four days,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We are standing with the back to the wall," said Michael Muth,
leader of the local crisis committee. The battle against flooding
had led to unprecedented use of materials and manpower.
Nevertheless, the danger of dike bursts was higher than ever
before, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the floodwaters remained at high levels on the
Oder or receded only a few centimetres at some locations. Real
relief would only come when the water levels drop by at least 1.5
metres, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Manfred Stolpe, state premier of the eastern German state of
Brandenburg, predicted this morning that the crisis situation
would still persist for eight to nine days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rescue workers had begun to construct a
3.2-kilometre-long emergency dike behind the primary one in
southern Oderbruch region. This would contain floodwaters in an
uninhabited area in the event of a major dike collapse, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe told the German newspaper
Bild am Sonntag that German troops, who had been leading the
battle against the flood over the past two weeks, would remain in
the region even after the crisis. They were expected to help
rebuild the damaged infrastructure and clean the environment, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Taylor Names 15-man Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's President Charles Taylor
has reportedly named a 15-member cabinet for his new government
inaugurated today, the News Agency of Nigeria quoted Liberian
newspapers as having reported.
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 named are Tome Woewiyou for labor, Roosevelt
Johnson for transport and Francois Massaquoi for youth and
sports.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of the three is seen by most Liberians as a sign
of Taylor's promise to forge unity and encourage reconciliation
in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Woeweiyou was Taylor's spokesman at the outbreak of
hostilities in 1989 and later broke ranks with him, while Johnson
and Massaquoi belonged to different warring factions and
political groups.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the cabinet also consists of at least
six persons who had served in previous governments from Tolbert's
regime to the Ruth Perry-led Council of State, the provisional
ruling body before Taylor's inauguration today.
</P>
<P>
These include Monie Captan for foreign affairs, Joe Mulbah for
information, Edward Sackor for internal affairs, Woewiyou Ernest
Eastman as minister of state and General Philip Kamah for
national security.
</P>
<P>
Other ministers are Peter Jaliah for justice, Bangali Fofana
for commerce, Roland Massaquoi for agriculture, Jenkins Dunbar
for land, mines and energy, John Richardson for public works, D.
Chea for defense and Joe Tate as commissioner for the bureau of
immigration.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, whose rebel fight against the late President Samuel
Doe triggered off the bitter civil war seven years ago, was sworn
in as the 21st president of the country in the capital Monrovia
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's inauguration came after his landslide victory in the
July 19 election, marking the end to the country's seven-year
bloody civil war that killed nearly 200,000 people, displaced
about a million others and destroyed the national economy.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural address, President Taylor urged Liberians to
help him set new changes and goals for the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Taylor promised to follow the order of law and respect human
rights, while assuring Liberians that there will be no witch
hunting.
</P>
<P>
He also called his former opponents to join him in rebuilding
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that Taylor's administration is facing the
daunting task of reconstruction of the country which Taylor
helped destroy in the past seven years.

<HEADLINE> IMF Mission Satisfied with Russia's Economic Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Head of the IMF office Martin
Gilman today said that the talks between Russia and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) that finished in Moscow Friday
were "extremely successful", the Interfax Financial Information
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission, which arrived in Moscow on July 22 to assess
the implementation by Russia of the 1997 economic program for the
second quarter, was greatly impressed by the professionalism and
resolve of Russian officials with regard to economic reforms,
Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the mission was extremely satisfied with Russia's
achievements in the area of the monetary-credit policy and in
particular the achievements of the Central Bank which has reduced
inflation further and increased foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
Gilman said the IMF mission recognized the difficulties in the
tax-budget sphere, that are likely to remain until adoption of the
new tax code and new provisions regarding the tax administration.
</P>
<P>
However, he continued, the IMF mission was on the whole
satisfied with the moves taken by the Russian government in this
area and its moves pertaining to structural policy.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Zimbabweans Launch Fund for Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe tonight hailed the launch of the African Resources
Investment Fund as a timely initiative that would help his
government's efforts to achieve black economic empowerment.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe made the remarks at the fund's launching gala in
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by a Zimbabwean business group based in South
Africa, the fund aims to boost acquisition of companies in
Zimbabwe by disadvantaged blacks to correct economic imbalances
inherited at independence from Britain in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he applauds the efforts of the non-resident
Zimbabweans who have come up with the fund aimed at promoting
black economic empowerment.
</P>
<P>
The overseas Zimbabweans have so far raised 27.27 million U.S
dollars for the fund, which will be generated through a share
issue before the end of August.
</P>
<P>
The gala was attended by South African President Nelson
Mandela and several Zimbabwean cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
About four million Zimbabweans live and work in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The fund, inaugurated last November in Johannesburg, has now
attracted Zimbabwean contributors in the United States, Britain
and Botswana.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown on Animal Smuggling Urged in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Nigerian environmental
protection official has called for the stricter enforcement of
the country's law against rare animal smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Adegoke Adegoroye, director-general of the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency expressed his concern over the
spate of illegal smuggling wildlife species, in an interview with
the News Agency of Nigeria recently.
</P>
<P>
He condemned those Nigerians that are involved in the hunting,
capture and trade of rare animals and stressed the need to
enlighten the public on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Adegoroye called on the diplomatic society to support and
cooperate with the Nigerian government in preserving wildlife
species.
</P>
<P>
The official's call came after two highly endangered drill
monkeys smuggled from Nigeria to the Philippines in 1995 were
returned to the country earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Drills are large, short-tailed rain forest monkeys that live
only in Nigeria, Cameroun and Equatorial Guinea. Its total
population is estimated to be between 2,000 or 3,000, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Help Turkmenistan in Air Force Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia has agreed to continue
helping Turkmenistan develop its air defenses and air force, the
Interfax news agency quoted the Russian air defense press service
as reporting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was made during a visit to Ashkhabad, the Turkmen
capital, by Russian air defense commander Viktor Prudnikov several
days ago.
</P>
<P>
The assistance will comprise two stages: the first stage (from
the rest of 1997 to 1998) would involve training personnel,
restoring radar control along Turkmenistan's borders, creating a
missile shield for the Central Asian country's capital Ashkhabad
and making Turkmen aircraft combat ready.
</P>
<P>
During the second stage, in 1999-2000, Russia would help to
complete the building of a stable radar monitoring system for
Turkmenistan and control centers for the country's air defense
forces.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Moscow also considers supplying
Ashkhabad city air defenses with an S-300 missile system.
</P>
<P>
During Prudnikov's visit to Ashkhabad the two sides also
discussed control of the air space over the Caspian Sea,
interaction between Russian and Turkmen air defense forces and
training and retraining Turkmen personnel in Russia.

<P>
ATHENS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Daniel Garcia of Mexico moved in front
in the final stage to win the men's 20-kilometer walk gold medal here
Saturday night at the 6th World Athletics Championships.
</P>
<P>
His winning time was one hour, 21 minutes 43 seconds ahead of
Mikhail Shchennikov of Russia's 1:21.53 and Mikhail Khmeinitsky of
Belarus's 1:22.01.
</P>
<P>
With seven of the first eight from the previous championships
returned to battle for the world crown, the race was tough throughout.
</P>
<P>
Ilya Markov and Shchennikov led the pace at the start and opened a
sizable lead 24 minutes after the race. But Ilya was sent out 30
minutes later while he was still in front.
</P>
<P>
Garcia, this year's World Cup silver medallist, seized the chance
to take the pace, followed by Shchennikov and Khmeinitsky.
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who was disqualified after entering the stadium in third
position in the 1993 world championships, and suffered the same fate
250 meters from the finish at the previous meet, maintained the
leading position confidently.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion and the year's leader Jefferson Perez of Ecuador
finished poorly in 14th.
</P>
<P>
Garcia said after the win:"I started to race very slowly and that
was my tactic for the victory. This win was my great aim after my
disqualifications in the previous two championships. For me, this
medal is worth three golds. I saw that Jefferson was not strong after
the 14 kilometers, and I was feeling strong myself."
</P>
<P>
Shchennikov was not satisfied with the result. "Frankly speaking I
don't understand why I had two warnings. The most critical moment came
when I heard the steps of Garcia behind me. I had to slow down my
pace."

<P>
Celebi said that the newly-established coalition government
would raise the number of free trade and industrial zones to boost
exports from an estimated 23 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Turkey currently has eight free zones, including those in the
ports in Mersin, Antalya, Trabzon, Istanbul and Mardin and the
total trade volume of the zones were 3.6 billion dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM Blasts Israeli Measures Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Salam al Majali today blasted measures taken by Israel against
Palestinians after the Jerusalem bombing attack on Israelis,
saying they violated Palestinians' rights.
</P>
<P>
Majali made the remark in a statement relased upon his arrival
here on a two-day official visit, during which he is expected to
exchange views with United Arab Emirates (UAE) leaders on the
latest developments in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Israel should condemn itself, not another side (in the peace
process). I do not think the Palestinian National Authority is an
abettor of violence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have arrested dozens of Palestinians
after the Wednesday bomb attack which killed 15 people and it also
claimed the PNA was behind the violence.
</P>
<P>
The attack has pushed the Middle East peace process to a
further retrogression. The peace process was set in deadlock
after Israel decided in February to build thousands of houses in
East Jerusalem which the Palestinians want to be the capital of a
future state.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian prime minister said "We are regretful over the
latest matters in the Middle East peace process. We do not think
Israel could get peace without giving Palestinians legal rights."
</P>
<P>
This is the second visit by Majali to the UAE in less than two
months.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Stresses Importance of Self-reliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
today called on members of Parliament to educate the people on
the need to be self-reliant to bring their development as less
donor assistance was now forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the special parliamentary committee session of the
ruling Revolutionary Party (CCM) in Dodoma, central Tanzania,
Mkapa, who doubles as CCM Chairman, said there is need to review
the 1995 CCM election manifesto which made several promises which
can be fulfilled with people's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said there is also need to invite private investors and
non-governmental organizations to help in implementation of some
promises made which can be implemented by them.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa admitted that promises in the CCM election manifesto
were not made to seek praise to CCM, but it was to the problems
that need to be removed, for example, an investor can construct a
bridge over the Kigammboni creek and operate it commercially.
</P>
<P>
Privatization, he said, has shown that it can make things move
as shown by production with the Tanzania Breweries and Tanzania
Cigarette companies which now bring twice as much revenue to the
government after being privatized.
</P>
<P>
Although it was anticipated that government revenue collection
would increase by 19.5 percent from now up to the year 2000,
foreign aid would go down by two thirds, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid would go down from 186.5 billion Tanzania
shillings (about 310.8 million US Dollars) in 1996/97 to 61
billion T. Shs. (about 101.6 million US Dollars) in 1999/2000, he
said, adding that up to June this year only 30 percent of this
had been given.
</P>
<P>
The CCM chairman said many projects which were being
implemented with donor assistance were stalled as the government
was supposed to contribute counterpart funds, which were not
available.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that projects which can be implemented with
assistance from the people, should be implemented that way as the
government had too may things to do and was cash strapped.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, primary schools country-wide require
148,000 latrines but there were only 43,000. "Can't the people
build these lavatories on self-help basis?" Mkapa asked.
</P>
<P>
He said the MPs and Himself will be judged by what they had
fulfilled to the people during the next election in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The CCM chairman said waiting for the government to do what
can be done by the people would very much relay development to
the people, noting that people must cultivate the spirit of self
sufficiency in themselves.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba: Zambia's Economic Environment "Stable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba said
today that Zambia's macro economic environment has stabilized
considerably.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the 71st agricultural and commercial show
here, Chiluba said that this year's theme for the show --
"sustainable growth" -- is most appropriate as it depicts the
performance of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the government commitment to pursue policies
conducive to the promotion of local entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the government is putting in place initiatives to
ensure the rural economy diversification succeeds.
</P>
<P>
"My government is committed to improving the quality of life
of our rural people, especially the rural farmer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba accused some traders of swindling out small scale
farmers of their produce, saying the unscrupulous traders should
be punished.
</P>
<P>
He said that farmers have not only been swindled by the
traders but have also been paid very low prices for their
produce.
</P>
<P>
The state of affairs undermines government efforts to improve
the quality of life through agriculture, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba toured the show before making the address.
</P>
<P>
A total of 270 local and foreign exhibitors are participating
in this year's show.

<HEADLINE> Bagach Wins First Gold, Boldon Shocks World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Aleksandr Bagach of Ukraine claimed
the first gold medal, but Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago robbed the
highlight of the first day competition at the 6th World Athletics
Championships by clocking a sizzling time in the men's 100 meters
second round here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bagach came from behind to beat defending champion and the year's
world leader John Godina of the United States in the men's shot put
final with a 21.47-meter winning toss.
</P>
<P>
The day's other gold medal was won by Daniel Garciaa of Mexico when
the World Cup silver medallist shaked off his bad luck to win the
men's 20-kilometer walk in one hour, 21 minutes 43 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Boldon, Olympic bronze medallist in both the 100m and 200m who is
keeping the year's best times this season, threatened Donovan Bailey's
world record of 9.84 seconds in the 100m second round, blazing down
the fast track with an unbelievable time of 9.87.
</P>
<P>
His time is only 0.03 seconds shy of the world record, and if he
had not eased up in the final strides, he would have broken the globe
mark in the heats!
</P>
<P>
Boldon said:"My dream is under 9.80 seconds. I wanted to see what
everyone else is doing in this round. Now I feel I am ready to beat
the world record."
</P>
<P>
Mauice Green of the United States, the fastest American sprinter
with a 9.90 personal best, wound up second behind Boldon in the group
with a brilliant time 9.90.
</P>
<P>
Bailey looked pale in the first two rounds, finishing second in
10.10. His world record may not survive this time under Boldon's feet
in the final tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
In the men's shot put final, Godina placed second at 21.43m, ahead
of Oliver-Sven Buder of Germany's 21.24.
</P>
<P>
Godina opened strongly with a 21.24 toss and increased his lead to
21.39 in the next try. But Bagach, who landed a pair of 20.55 and
20.60, turned the table on the third round, unleashing his mighty
winner. World record holder and Olympic champion Randy Barnes of the
United States slumped in the qualifying round, finishing a distance
14th.
</P>
<P>
Bagach said after his triumph:"I thought Godina and Barnes would be
the most serious opponents. I am so sorry for Barnes."
</P>
<P>
Godina was upset, saying:"I messed up. There was no way I should
have lost today. It is one of those things I will have deal with."
</P>
<P>
The men's 20km walk saw seven of the first eight from the previous
championships return to battle the world title. Ilya Markov and
Mikhail Shchennikov, both from Russia, led the pace in the first 24
minutes. But Ilya was sent out 30 minutes later while he was still in
front.
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who was disqualified after entering the stadium in third
position in the 1993 World Championships, and suffered the same fate
250 meters from the finish at the previous meet, ended his bad luck by
winning his first world title.
</P>
<P>
Shchennikov and Mikhail Khmeinitsky of Belarus took the silver and
bronze respectively. Olympic champion and the year's best time setter
Jefferson Perez of Ecuador wrapped up 14th.
</P>
<P>
Garcia said after the win:"I started to race very slowly and that
was my tactic for the victory. This win was great aim after my
disqualifications in the previous two championships. For me, this
medal is worth three."
</P>
<P>
In the women's 100m second round, Marion Jones of the United States
romped home in 10.96 seconds. The fastest runner was Zhanna
Pintussevich of Ukraine who clocked 10.90.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Merlene Ottey of Jamaica was still very powerful in
the race, hitting the 11 second to lead her group.
</P>
<P>
The day also witnessed the disppointed failures of some other big
names.
</P>
<P>
In the women's triple jump qualifying, world record holder Inessa
Kravets of Ukraine pulled out of the competition in front of the sand
pit. Anna Biryukova of Russia, the 1993 world champion and the first
woman over 15 meters, injured her knee on the first round.
</P>
<P>
Sunday will feature three finals - the men's and women's 100m
finals and men's hammer.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Clear Land-mines in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 2 (xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Army needs
more than 13.6 million U.S. Dollars to clear hundreds of
thousands of land mines scattered along the country's borders in
five years, an army officer said today.
</P>
<P>
Director of engineering corps colonel Sibangumuzi Khumala said
the money would be used for buying mine clearing, logistics and
camping equipment to replace the current outdated and dilapidated
machinery.
</P>
<P>
He was briefing general James Jamerson, U.S. deputy commander
in chief for Europe and Africa who is on a three-day visit to
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"Currently the army has two mine clearing teams, but we have
proposed to set up six teams once we get the necessary funding to
enable us to effectively deal with the problem," Khumala said,
adding the army would carry out the exercise far much cheaper
than a private contractor.
</P>
<P>
He said the European Union last year funded Zimbabwe to clear
a stretch of land along the north-western border, a big sum which
the army could use to clear the whole country of land mines.
</P>
<P>
General Jamerson is expected to make a U.S. defense force
commitment to assisting its Zimbabwean counterparts in ridding
the country of land mines planted by the Rhodesian army at the
height of the liberation war to control armed incursions by
guerillas.

<HEADLINE> Diplomatic Sanction Against Bosnia Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sarajevo, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The international community High
Representative Carlos Westendorp on Saturday called for contacts
with current Bosnia's ambassadors to be suspended after its three
ethnic factions failed to meet a deadline on allocating diplomatic
posts.
</P>
<P>
"I am obliged by Sintra to propose the measures to the
international community, as from now, not to deal with ambassadors
who do not represent the country as a whole," Westendorp told a
press conference here.
</P>
<P>
During an international conference in Sintra, Portugal, two
months ago, participants set August 1 as the deadline for Bosnian
partities to reach an agreement on the diplomatic posts.
</P>
<P>
Despite mediation from Westendorp, leaders of the Bosnian
muslins, Serbs and Croats still dispute on the ethnic make-up of
diplomatic corps and diplomatic positions for each nation.
</P>
<P>
Current ambassadors in foreign countries are no longer
recognized as legitimate representatives of Bosnia until the
parties reach an agreement, Westendorp said.
</P>
<P>
The High Representative said that he has postposed until Monday
the announcement of punitive measures on issues of citizenship and
common passport, which should also be solved by Friday.
</P>
<P>
If those two issues are not solved by Monday, he might propose
the international community not recognize passports of the Bosnian
officials responsible for the failure, Westendorp said.

<HEADLINE> Rape Cases Increase in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A cabinet minister today said
1,866 rape cases were reported in Zimbabwe since the beginning of
this year in what is increasingly becoming a menace for the
country.
</P>
<P>
Health and Child Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps said 833 or
45 percent of the cases involved abuse of juveniles, some of them
by close relatives or individuals in positions of trust.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a one-day forum on child abuse and rape of
minors in Harare, Stamps said there is urgent need to tackle the
cause of the problem and punish those who carry out such acts.
</P>
<P>
He said on average four juveniles were raped daily in each of
the country's eight provinces.
</P>
<P>
Harare was leading with the number of reported cases ranging
between 11 and 12 per day, while Bulawayo, the country's second
largest city had an average of eight cases recorded per day.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, we didn't want to know about these things, but
we now have to face up to the risk caused by this menace because
those who abuse children do not realize the danger done to the
victim's personality," he said.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian Michael Doohan
strengthened his grip on the 1997 world title when he won the
Brazilian 500cc Grand Prix on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was Doohan's ninth win in 10 races this season -- and his
seventh straight -- as the three-time world champion continued to
dominate the season on his Repsol Honda.
</P>
<P>
Doohan, starting from pole for the seventh straight race, was
once again unstoppable over the 4.933km Jacarepagua circuit
despite his traditional slow start. He was clocked 45 minutes
05.793 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Australian was in the lead by halfway through the first of
the 24 laps and stayed there, despite a determined challenge from
Japan's Tadayuki Okada, who finished second on his Honda --
7/10ths of a second behind.
</P>
<P>
Luca Cadalora of Italy was third on his Yamaha.
</P>
<P>
Doohan now has 245 points from a possible 250 with five
championship races remaining. Okada is second on 129 points with
Nobuatsu Aoki of Japan third on 126.
</P>
<P>
The Repsol Honda team have now won all 10 of this season's
races so far and Doohan is closing in on Italian Giacomo
Agostini's record of 11 wins in a season.

ATHENS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Michael Johnson of
the United States almost failed to qualify for the semifinals of the
men's 400 meters when he ran a slow time of 45.39 seconds in the
second round at the 6th World Athletics Championships here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic champion finished fourth in his group and placed 15th
among the 16 qualifiers. He led the field off the final curve, but
eased up on the home straight. Ibrahima Wade of Senegal kicked hard
and nipped him at the line.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said after the race:"I was sure I had a firm grip on my
position. I just didn't see him, it surprised me that he was suddenly
beside me."
</P>
<P>
The fastest qualifier was Jerome Young of the United States in
44.87 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Johnson injured his leg in the 150-meter race against Donovan
Bailey of Canada on June 1. His 54 winning streak for the 400m over
eight years snapped last month in Europe. The Olympic hero looked just
like a shadow of his best days.

<P>
BRUSSELS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Belgium suspended all aerobatics
flights to be held on Belgian military airports until the
investigation result of the July 26 crash at an air show comes
out, local television reported today.
</P>
<P>
The air show at a civil airport in Moorsele near Courtrai,
scheduled on August 23 and 24, is also cancelled.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Defense Minister Jean-Pol Poncelet has ordered an
assistant to investigate into the organization of aerobatics
flights in the country after a Jordanian aerobatics plane crashed
during performance in the seaside resort of Ostend.
</P>
<P>
Nine people were killed and 55 injured when the German-made
Falcon biplane, piloted by the leader of the Jordanian royal air
display team, lost control while doing a looping stunt and crashed
into the crowd around a Red Cross tent near the runway.
</P>
<P>
Eleven injured victims, most of whom burnt by the kerosene
sprayed by the plane when it hit the ground and burst into flames,
are still receiving treatment in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the plane was flying overhead the
spectators while doing the stunt, which was forbidden by air show
rules.
</P>
<P>
Primary probes showed that several other planes also flew
overhead the spectators on the day. The report has caused concerns
of the military authorities.
</P>
<P>
Air shows are popular summer events in Belgium, drawing many
visitors each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police are stepping
up their surveillance on triads to prevent Macao's wave of
organized crime violence spilling over into Hong Kong, the Sunday
Morning Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Secretary for Security of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Peter Lai Hing-ling as
saying that a ban had been placed on suspected gang members
entering from Macao.
</P>
<P>
The English-language newspaper said the HKSAR government was
concerned about escalating crimes in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Suspected people who are not Hong Kong residents will be
denied entry. We cannot ban those who are Hong Kong residents, but
police will strengthen monitoring their activities," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
He warned Hong Kong residents planning to go to Macao for
holidays or work to be especially careful.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he released some figures showing a continuing drop in
Hong Kong's overall crime rate.
</P>
<P>
According to him, overall crime dropped 16.4 percent to 34,421
cases in the first six months of this year from the same period of
1996.

<HEADLINE> President: Greek Cypriots Remain Positive for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said here today Cyprus is determined to show a positive
attitude toward international efforts to achieve a solution to the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a commemoration service here for the
20th anniversary of the death of first president of the Republic
of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios III.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that Cyprus is at a crucial crossroads, but
despite the difficulties that lie ahead, the Greek Cypriot side
will show the same positive attitude at the second round of
direct talks, scheduled to take place in Switzerland on August
11-16, as in the first round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash held their
first round of direct talks under the U.N. auspices near New
York on July 9-12 and agreed to continue negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Clerides and Denktash held two meetings here under
the U.N. auspices to reach an agreement on the humanitarian
issue of missing persons during the event of 1974 Turkish
military intervention.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side has expressed the hope that Denktash
will attend the second round of talks in August. Denktash has
threatened not to take part in the direct talks after the
European Union reaffirmed last month a decision to begin EU
accession talks with Cyprus early next year.
</P>
<P>
Clerides reiterated that "we know that the solution to the
Cyprus problem will be a compromise, but we will not accept a
compromise that threatens the independence and territorial
integrity of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of the failed coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenya's Reactions to IMF Loan Suspension  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Wang Jinyu)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Different reactions have been
made by Kenyan government and opposition leaders and leaders of
religious orgnizations following the decision by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to halt an aid package to the
country.
</P>
<P>
On July 31, the IMF decided to suspend a three-year Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) amounting to 215 million
U.S. Dollars because of the alleged failure by the Kenyan
government "to show its commitment to fighting corruption".
</P>
<P>
In response to the IMF decision, Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said on Auguest 1 that the Kenyan government " would not
succumb to threats, intimidations or ultimatums as it had a duty
to protect all Kenyans."
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi
announced a chop in the 1997/98 financial year expenditure
accompanied by revenue measures to address the shortfall caused
by the IMF decision.
</P>
<P>
"Sunday Times" today carried an editorial, criticizing the IMF
for applying double standards to African countries regarding
political and economic liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The paper run by the ruling Kenya African National Union
pointed out that Kenya had done almost all that was required by
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, "everytime the government carries out
particular reforms, more demands are quick to surface," adding
that " When new demands are being made, those that have been met
by the government are deliberately forgotten."
</P>
<P>
Certain African countries are yet to implement multi-partism,
it noted, they continue to receive support from the West without
endless conditionalities.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi Kiptanui, the National Deputy Chairman of the Kenya
Muslims Supreme Council, noted that the IMF decision was aimed at
causing chaos in the East African country.
</P>
<P>
Kenyans were fed up with external pressures and would not
succumb to foreigners on how to run their own affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Head of Kenya Catholic Church Archbishop Ndingi Nzeki also
criticized the IMF for cutting the loan, arguing that since the
reform process in the country had been put into gear, the IMF had
no business "interfering" with it.
</P>
<P>
And Musikari Kombo, branch Chairman of opposition FORD-Kenya
in Bungoma District, has attributed Kenya's economic instability
to more than 30 years of over-reliance on external funding.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Deputy Leader of the opposition National Convention
Executive Council, James Orengo, Saturday asked Kenyan
Attorney-General Amos Wako to take appropriate actions to
prosecute the individuals involved in the massive fraudulent
diversion of transit sugar into the local market.
</P>
<P>
The IMF was reportedly concerned by the sudden removing last
month of Samuel Chebii from the post of Commissioner of Customs
and Excise, who was investigating the import of sugar by
companies with links to some politicians.
</P>
<P>
Chebii had been "undoubtedly removed from his post as he had
stringently fought" against the dumping of imported transit sugar
into the local market, the IMF has said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the IMF was also angered by repeated
scandals in kenya's energy, customs and agricultrure sectors that
led to huge losses.
</P>
<P>
Mwai Kibaki, Chairman of the opposition Democratic Party of
Kenya, pointed out that the government had known that the IMF
could withhold aid if corruption was not brought under control
and the government should have taken appropriate actions to deal
with the matter.

<HEADLINE> Report: Saddam's Son Uday to Be Treated in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
eldest son Uday, is to be operated on here to remove from his
spinal cord a bullet shot at him in an ambush last year, Middle
East Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The English weekly, in its latest edition, cited unnamed
sources as saying that Egyptian authorities have given "the green
light to the hospitalization of Uday Saddam Hussein in Cairo on
humanitarian grounds."
</P>
<P>
"A team of surgeons specializing in bones and neurology will be
chosen to operate on Uday in a Cairo hospital," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats in Amman said that foreign surgeons would be
called in to assist in the "very delicate operation."
</P>
<P>
The sources said that contacts had been made with the United
Nations to authorize Uday to fly to the Egyptian capital from
Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, which has been under an
international air embargo since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Uday, 33, left hospital on June 9, six months after gunmen
sprayed his car with bullets in the center of Baghdad on December
12. Iraqi officials said he made a "full recovery" although he
appeared on crutches.
</P>
<P>
German surgeons operated on Uday's leg in April with reported
success but did not want to perform the delicate spinal cord
operation in an Iraqi hospital because of the poor conditions and
lack of medical equipment, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi authorities have announced no arrests in the
assassination bid, while Uday has pointed a finger at Iran, which
fought an eight-year war against Iraq from 1980 to 1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, August 3 (Xinhua)- About 28,000 metric tons of
diesel and generating oil for electricity were brought into
Freetown early today from Nigeria as west african states are
to tighten their sanctions against Sierra leone.
</P>
<P>
Wo Chunchi, captain of the Chinese vessel, said two other
vessels are expected in Freetown shortly with petrol and
kerosene.
</P>
<P>
The consignment was loaded off the dock by Chinese
and local workers.
</P>
<P>
The generating oil arrived in time to save the city from being
plunged into darkness as oil reserves for electricity power had
almost dwindled.
</P>
<P>
"This is just a stroke of luck in the best of timing," said
one dock worker.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the National Petroleum Company (NPC) said the
oil stock will last for four to five months and it is enough to
give a 24 hours non-stop light in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The oil consignment follows the arrival of crucial rice stock
of some 6,000 metric tonnes last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said the military government is acting
urgently to "collect all vital stocks of petroleum and other
commodities in anticipation of a tightening of sanctions by the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) after the
collapsed talks in Abidjan last week.
</P>
<P>
Delegation of the military government to the failed Abidjan
talks are expected to return here on Monday after visits to
Burkina Faso and Togo to explore avenues for the talks to be
reconvened.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Fighting Rages as Pakistan Resumes Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between the Afghan
Islamic Taliban militia and their rivals continued to rage north
of Kabul as Pakistan resumed its peace efforts in the war-torn
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces edged their frontlines forward as the
militia regained control of the town of Hossein Kot, about 20 km
north of Kabul, where the Taliban and their rivals have been
fighting over the past week, according to reports monitored here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's gains represent the first change in more than a
week of deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The forces loyal to Ahmad Masood captured Hossein Kot late July
in a major surprise offensive which has brought them to within
rocket range of Kabul. However, since then both sides have failed
to gain any significant ground north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
While fighting continued to rage north of Kabul, Iftikhar
Murshed, Pakistani Additional Foreign Secretary on Afghanistan,
expressed here today the hope for holding an intra-Afghan dialogue
under the UN auspices soon.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying very hard for holding an intra-Afghan dialogue
for peace in Afghanistan and one is always optimistic," said
Murshed today when talking to reporters about his latest visit to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Murshed, who on Saturday visited Kandahar, the Taliban's
stronghold in southern Afghanistan, said that he expected to fly
to Mazar-e-Sharif, headquarters of the anti-Taliban northern
alliance, on Monday for talks with the alliance leaders.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300 km north of
Kabul, last month, Murshed rallied a positive response from the
alliance leaders including Masood and Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Murshed had secured the Taliban's support for the
formation of a political commission from the Taliban's former
foreign minister Muhammad Ghaus.
</P>
<P>
Murshed described Ghaus' offer as a "breakthrough and
step-forward" in diplomatic efforts for peace in the war-battered
country.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban northern alliance had forwarded the idea of
setting up a political commission for the formation of a
broad-based government in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
However, Ghaus, member of the Taliban Central Shura, has
stressed that the political commission should include not just the
northern alliance but other Afghan groups as well.

<P>
Editor's note: China has scored great progress in its reform
and opening-up efforts since the convocation of the 14th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in October,
1992. Beginning today, Xinhua will mark this fall's opening of the
15th CPC National Congress with a special column outlining the
monumental success the third generation leadership of the CPC
Central Committee headed by Jiang Zemin has achieved in accordance
with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The past five years have witnessed
the introduction of a series of CPC Central Committee decisions
designed to raise the quality of leading officials and select
outstanding young officials.
</P>
<P>
Since the holding of the 14th CPC National Congress, Party
committees at various levels and relevant organization departments
have given priority to enhancing the competence of officials in
line with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>

requirements set by CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang
Zemin, and have in turn strengthened supervision in order to
ensure a clean government.

In-depth studies of model Communist Party members, including
Kong Fansen who was dedicated to his assignment in the Tibet
Autonomous Region, have provided leading officials with the
political and ideological awareness needed to carry forward the
fine tradition's of the Party.
</P>
<P>
Local Party organizations, including those in Shanghai and the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have successfully sponsored
diverse activities which have helped improve the ideological and
political quality of officials.
</P>
<P>
Replacing older officials with younger ones has gradually
rationalized the age structure of leading officials. A large
number of highly competent educated people with high level
profession ability have been promoted to leadership positions at
various levels.
</P>
<P>
The number of provincial, prefectural and county leading
officials holding college degrees has jumped by 14.7, 12.6 and
10.2 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more people proficient at business management or
with good scientific and technological knowledge have been

<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, close attention has been paid to ensuring that new
officials inherit and carry forward the fine traditions and work
styles of the Party. This has helped build a contingent of capable
party officials readily adapted to new conditions associated with
a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Party organizations at various levels have educated
officials, leading officials in particular, in the need to
improve ties between officialdom and the general public, and in
wholeheartedly serving the people.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials in Liaoyang, Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, have forged closer ties with local residents by
exhibiting special concern for the needy.
</P>
<P>
Work experience in grassroots units has been taken as an an
important criterion for promoting an official.
</P>
<P>
Officials indulging in ostentatious life styles or those
unwilling to work in grass roots units, as well as those incapable
of identifying themselves with the masses or those who are unable
to solve problems stand to no chance for promotion.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Party efforts to strengthen leading bodies and
official ranks have followed the principle of "promoting those who
are acknowledged by the general public as adhering to the Party's
line of the reform and opening-up, and who have recorded
merits in performing their duties."
</P>
<P>
Effective measures introduced since the last national congress
in 1992 have strengthened efforts to build the Party's leading
bodies and official ranks. Related efforts have included improving
the quality and ideology of leading officials at various levels,
as well as promoting and training outstanding young officials.
</P>
<P>
The large number of highly proficient model officials emerging
over the past few years have contributed greatly to educating
people and improving the cohesiveness of the Party.

JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- South African Minister of
Justice Dullah Omar will ask the cabinet to appoint one thousand
new court officials to boost the ailing justice system, local
daily Sunday Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Omar as saying that he would urge the
cabinet to approve a 65.2-million U.S. dollar scheme to improve
the national court system with three-to-four hundred extra
prosecutors, and one-to-two hundred extra magistrates, as well as
72 new regional courts.
</P>
<P>
Omar said he was also seeking to improve the pay package for
prosecutors, who were leaving because "they are not treated as
professionals".
</P>
<P>
According to Omar, South Africa's financial budget for the
court system, which is at just one percent of the total budget,
was "probably the lowest in the world".
</P>
<P>
Last week, Omar said that the cabinet would study a draft
legislation to put bail beyond the reach of suspects accused of
murder, rape, car hijacking and other serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noticed that the South African government are
trying to amend its existing judicial systems in a bid to curb
increasing vicious crimes.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Spends Billion Dollars on Liberian Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian head of state Sani Abacha
said Saturday that his country has spent no less
than three billion U.S. dollars on the Liberian peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while attending the inauguration ceremony
of Liberian's newly-elected President Charles Taylor in Monrovia,
which marks the culmination of the Liberian peace process mainly brokered
by Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was the among the first west African countries to send
its soldiers to sub-regional peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG
in August 1990, eight months after the Liberian civil war broke
out.
</P>
<P>
Through the seven years of peace-keeping, Liberia contributed
the largest force as well as most of the material and financial
support to ECOMOG, the strength of which increased from the
beginning 3,000 men to 12,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
As General Abacha put it, "The road to peace in Liberia has
not been easy". It has been won "in blood, sweat and the
commitment of vast resources of the states of the sub-region",
he added.
</P>
<P>
The peace-keeping mission in Liberia is unique. The
peace-keepers had to fight directly with the armed factions for
their very survival and presence.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, there have been peace-keepers who were killed,
captured or injured, though their exact number is not known as
this moment.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Popular Musician Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, the
originator of Afrobeat, and the popular and controversial Nigerian
musician died Saturday at the age of 59.
</P>
<P>
His death was announced by his family in Lagos. But the
announcement did not say where he died.
</P>
<P>
What is known to the media is that he had been ill for a long
time and was hospitalized in a Lagos hospital. But some reports
said he may have returned to his home town in Abeokuta, Ongo
State, in southwest Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Fela was born on October 15, 1938. He formed his first band
in 1959 in London, where he was attending the Trinity College of
Music, Oxford from 1959 to 1962.
</P>
<P>
Fela leaves behind him over 40 music albums. Known as King of
Afrobeat, he is the most popular musician in Nigeria and his
influence went beyond his own country.
</P>
<P>
Most of his works are believed to have political undertones
which led to his strained relations with the authority.
</P>
<P>
His private life is most controversial. He was reportedly
married to 27 wives and is known to be using Indian hemp for
which his home was raided by the police for two times, the second
time just several months ago.

<HEADLINE> Gulf States Shelve Single Currency Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Arab states have shelved a
plan to unify their currencies as part of a long-standing drive to
create a common market, a senior Omani official said in an
interview published here today.
</P>
<P>
Hamud bin Hashem, executive president of the Omani Central
Bank, said the issue had been discussed at several meetings of
finance ministry and central bank officials of the six-member
Gulf Cooperation Council(GCC).
</P>
<P>
"All of them affirmed that exchange rates in the GCC are
stable and do not constitute any restrictions on the movement of
trade, investment and capital among them," he told the Arab daily
Al-Ittihad.
</P>
<P>
"They agreed to continue with the current arrangements for
exchange rates and postpone discussions of the common currency
peg," he said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states had planned to create a single currency called
the Gulf dinar for their planned common market, which will also
include a customs union. But they abandoned such a project and
opted instead for unification of their exchange rates, a plan that
has been under negotiations for years.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said the currency project was held up by reservations
by some members on proposals to unlink their currencies from the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Except for Kuwait, whose dinar is tied to a basket of major
currencies, the national currencies of the GCC states are
effectively linked to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed on encouraging expansion in using national
currencies in member states and boosting coordination in monetary
policies." Hashem said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Kuwait, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain
and Qatar.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Typhoon Victor, the worst to
hit Hong Kong in 14 years, moved away from the region early
this morning after killing one person and injuring at least 55
overnight.
</P>
<P>
The first typhoon of the season this year, Victor, packing
winds of between 110 kph and 120 kph, was centered over Hong Kong
last night, and was moving further into Guangdong Province, some
150 kilometers north-northwest of Hong Kong, at 03:30 this
morning, weather forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
The No. 9 Typhoon Signal was raised at 04:50 on Saturday
afternoon, the first time since 1983. It was lowered to No 8
shortly before midnight after Victor was weakening into a "severe
tropical storm."
</P>
<P>
The No. 8 signal was lowered at 03:30 this morning and replaced
by the No, 3 Strong Wind Signal.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, a 44-year-old British man who
drowned off Stanley was among the three people who were pulled
from the rough seas. Another person plucked from the water was in
satisfactory condition in hospital, while a third person was not
injured.
</P>
<P>
At least 55 people were reported injured but most were treated
in hospital for minor injuries and released.
</P>
<P>
With the same hurricane-force wind, Typhoon Ellen swept across
Hong Kong in 1983, killing 10 people and injuring over 300.
</P>
<P>
This time, Victor also caused transport chaos, bringing buses,
ferries, planes and taxis to a virtual standstill. On Saturday,
over 322 flights were cancelled or delayed.
</P>
<P>
Victor formed in the South China Sea on Thursday and appeared
to be headed for Hainan Island before changing course and bearing
down on Hong Kong. It was Upgraded to a No. 3 storm at 10:00 on
Friday morning and then to a No. 8 on Saturday at noon.
</P>
<P>
Weather watchers said the storm gained quickly as it approached
Hong Kong. For just the third time in history the center of a
typhoon crossed directly over the urban area with heavy rains. Up
to 200 millimeters of rain fell in Hong Kong by midnight between
Saturday and today.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon Victor passed between Hong Kong Island and Lantau
Island at about 08:00 on Saturday evening, and then crossed the
Tsing Ma Bridge before making landfall near Tsuen Wan.
</P>
<P>
At the Hong Kong International Airport, more than 320 flights
were affected. Among them, 49 incoming flights were cancelled, 84
delayed and 30 diverted. For departure, 68 flights were cancelled
and 91 delayed.
</P>
<P>
The Local authorities suspended all bus, ferry and tram
services by 19:30 on Saturday, while the open sections of the Mass
Transit Railway were closed half an hour earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Kowloon-Guangzhou Railway suspended services at the same
time, while the Light Rail Transit services were suspended from
20:30 on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, two east-bound lanes of Wong Chuk Hang Road were
closed near the Grantham Hospital due to dangerous scaffolding,
while Cooper Road, Happy Valley, and Island Road were closed due
to a tree fall as were Shaouson Hill Road, Aberdeen and the Shek
O-bound Tai Tam Road.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Prime Minister Ends Visit to UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Salam al Majali today ended his visit to the United Arab Emirates
with a call on Israel to give Palestinians legal rights.
</P>
<P>
According to UAE's Wam news agency, Majali, during his second
visit here in a little more than a month, said Israel should give
Palestinians legal rights so as to realize peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We are regretful over the latest matters in the Middle East
peace process. We do not think Israel could get peace without
giving Palestinians legal rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, the Jordanian premier held discussions with
senior UAE officials on the latest developments in the Middle East
region in the wake of a double suicide bombings in a major
vegetable and fruit market in Jerusalem killing 15 people and
wounding over 150 others.
</P>
<P>
Majali attacked measures taken by Israel after the bloody
bombings, saying they "violated Palestinians' rights."
</P>
<P>
"Israel should condemn itself, not another side. I do not
think the Palestinian Authority is an abettor of violence," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Israel has imposed closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
arrested more than 70 Palestinians, blaming the Palestinian
Authority for the violence and threatened to re-enter Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
During the talks today, UAE's vice premier said UAE is also
seriously concerned over the deteriorated Middle East peace
process and it called Israel to change its settlement policies to
resume peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"We called for the resumption of peace negotiations which have
reached an impasse because of Israel's settlement policies in Arab
Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
A just, comprehensive peace should be obtained on the basis of
giving Palestinians legal rights, allowing them to establish
their own state on their lands with Jerusalem as the capital, and
implementing the land-for-peace principle, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also called the United States and Russia, the two key
sponsors of the Middle East peace process to force Israel to
change its hardline policies.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Confirmed as Iran's New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Most Iranians were relieved to
watch the transfer of the highest executive power from outgoing
President Hashemi Rafsanjani to his moderate successor, the
incoming President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony today attended by ministers, high-ranking
government officials and foreign diplomats, Khatami was conferred
with the confirmation from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
the top politico-religious figure towering above the country.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, 54, was minister of culture and Islamic guidance for
about 10 years. He resigned in 1992 and became cultural adviser to
Rafsanjani and head of National Library of Iran.
</P>
<P>
In his acceptance speech the moderate cleric offered olive
branch to the world while vowing to carry on the legacy of the
founder of the Islamic Revolution, late spiritual leader Ayatollah
Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
"At the international level, we seek to establish peace and
security ... peace and security for all nations and that is why we
oppose expansionism of great powers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation, read by Rafsanjani on Khamenei's behalf,
requested the new president to adhere to the roads and principles
of the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
"It goes without saying that my decree would, like the votes of
the people, remain valid as long as the president would ... stand
against the tyrannical and oppressive enemies of Iran," read the
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
In his speech today, Khamenei urged Khatami to devise plans to
fight widespread poverty across Iran. Two thirds of the country's
60 million population is believed to be living under the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts should be spent that poverty, injustice and
discrimination would be eliminated in Iran," Khamenei said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's predecessor, President Rafsanjani, sounded relieved
in stepping down after two four-year terms in power, whose liberal
policies paying off in breathing life to the country's war-torn
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The person who is giving up the responsibility is feeling
relaxed and unburdened, and the person who is taking over is
feeling the responsibility," Rafsanjani said in farewell speech.
</P>
<P>
On Monday Khatami is expected to attend Iran's Parliament and
be sworn in as Iran's fifth president since the Islamic
Revolution of 1979. Iran's system of rule before the revolution
was a monarchical rule dating back to 500 B.C.
</P>
<P>
Entering the presidential race with a liberal platform, Khatami
gained over 20 million votes, the highest votes ever secured by
any Iranian president, in May presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
His arch competitor, conservative Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq Nouri, obtained only 7 million votes.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Khatami will have an uphill battle
ahead with a Majlis (parliament) dominated by the conservatives,
which has called on Khatami to discuss his choice of ministers
with them.
</P>
<P>
So far Khatami has refused to give in to pressures from the
270-seat Parliament to reveal the names of his ministers.
</P>
<P>
Local press here today said the new president will introduce
his cabinet to the Parliament on August 9 and 10.

<HEADLINE> Kunming Striving to Increase Urban Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Kunming, the capital city of the
southwestern Yunnan Province, is working hard to increase the
capacity of water supply in its urban area so as to cope with its
serious water shortage problem.
</P>
<P>
The city government plans to invest more than three billion
yuan (361 million US dollars) for the short and long-term plans to
bring in additional 300 million cubic meters of water annually.
</P>
<P>
At present, the annual water supply for the city with an urban
population of some two million residents was only 195 million
cubic meters, with a daily deficiency of about 200,000 cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
According to the Overall Municipal Construction Program, the
annual water supply to the main urban area will be 330 million
cubic meters by the year 2000, 400 million cubic meters by 2010
and 476 million cubic meters by 2020.
</P>
<P>
So the city party committee and government took emergency
measures and introduced a water-diversion project in its adjacent
area. An investment of 200 million yuan (24 billion US dollars)
will be made in two years for providing some 800,000 of its urban
residents with 50 million cubic meters of water, and the project
is expected to be completed in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in an effort to put an end to water supply shortage,
the Kunming city government has resolved to channel water from
Zhangjiu River, a tributary of the Jinsha River in Southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year project, which is scheduled to be launched in
1999, will require an investment of 2.9 billion yuan (349 million
US dollars) in building a complete reservoir network with pumping
stations, water diversion channels, and waterworks. It is reported
that the Ministry of Construction has listed it among the 23 major
city water supply projects, which are subjected to the State
Planning Commission for approval.
</P>
<P>
This program will help ease the burden of Dianchi Lake, the
leading source of water supply for urban residents, and to
alleviate the sewage pollution for the local environment.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Seeks to Boost Oil Output Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi oil official
announced that Iraq can now export nearly 2.5 million barrels of
crude oil each day.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper "Al-Qadissiya" today quoted Taha Mahmoud
Moussa, senior under-secretary of the Oil Ministry as saying the
country will be capable of export 3 million barrels per day after
some simple technical requisites are fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is now ready to resume exporting oil since U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan has approved its distribution plan for food and
medicine under the "food-for-oil" deal with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
It has marketed all the amount of oil provided for by the
renewed formula with the U.N. for another six months, which
reaches 120 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking - within our future plan - to increase our
crude-oil production capacity to 6 million barrels per day, and
to bring our oil reserves to some 320 billion barrels instead of
112 billion barrels at present," Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Iraq possesses oil fields that have not
been exploited yet.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Iraq is continuing efforts to increase its
oil-refining capacity, develop its giant oil fields and discover
new ones.

HARARE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean cabinet minister
Saturday called on the Zimbabwean women to continue the fight for
their rights to realise their dream of being equal with men.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual conference of the Women's Action Group

system introduced by the government to elect capable women for
positions in the public services.

empowered," the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Stresses Security Cooperation in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Information Minister
Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah has underlined the need to activate
multilateral organizations to safeguard collective security in the
Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The minister voiced his proposition in an interview with the
Kuwait television last night on the seventh anniversary of Iraqi
invasion of the small but rich Gulf country.
</P>
<P>
He said that regional safety and security need to be guaranteed
through the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the
enlarged Damascus Declaration and other defense treaties with a
number of states that took part in the international alliance to
liberate Kuwait in the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is a member of the GCC which also groups Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirate, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar. In March 1991, soon
after the Gulf War ended, the six nations signed with Syria and
Egypt the Damascus Declaration to beef up security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait also signed with the United States and other western
countries a number of security agreements to strengthen its
position in collective security.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, the Kuwaiti minister again warned the
people against "existing Iraqi regime's threats to Kuwait,"
stressing the 1990-91 Iraqi aggression against Kuwait was
also directed against the GCC.
</P>
<P>
He called on Kuwait and other GCC countries to devise options
to defend themselves against any similar aggression in the
future.
</P>
<P>
While touching on the suffering of the Iraqi people under the
stricture of U.N. imposed sanctions, the minister blamed the Iraqi
regime for the plight of its people. However, he cautioned, any
attempt to overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein would lead to
bloodshed in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On normalizing relations with countries siding with Iraq in the
Gulf War, Sheikh Saud said the issue was carefully studied by the
concerned authorities with Kuwait's interests as the focal point.
</P>
<P>
"The restoration of relations is not an emotional issue but
rather a matter of state interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he maintained that "a clear position should be made by
the leadership of these states."
</P>
<P>
Concerning Kuwaiti-Palestinian relations, Sheikh Saud stressed
that "our dispute with the Palestinian leadership is due to its
position during the Iraqi aggression but we support the legitimate
rights of the Palestinian people."

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Victor Moves Away, Leaving One Dead in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Typhoon Victor, the worst to
hit Hong Kong in 14 years, moved away early this morning after
killing one person and injuring at least 55 overnight.
</P>
<P>
The first typhoon of the season this year, Victor, packing
winds of between 110 kph and 120 kph, was centered over Hong Kong
last night, and was moving further into Guangdong Province, some
150 km north-northwest of Hong Kong, at 03:30 this morning,
weather forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
The No. 9 Typhoon Signal was raised at 04:50 on Saturday
afternoon, the first time since 1983. It was lowered to No. 8
shortly before midnight after Victor was weakening into a "severe
topical storm."
</P>
<P>
The No. 8 signal was lowered at 03:30 this morning and replaced
 by the No. 3 Strong Wind Signal.
</P>
<P>
According to local police, a 44-year-old British man who
drowned off Stanley was among the three people who were pulled
from the rough seas. Another person plucked from the water was in
satisfactory condition in hospital, while a third person was not
injured.
</P>
<P>
At least 55 people were reported injured but most were treated
in hospital for minor injuries and released.
</P>
<P>
With the same hurricane-force wind, Typhoon Ellen swept across
Hong Kong in 1983, killing 10 people and injuring over 300.
</P>
<P>
This time, Victor also caused transport chaos, bringing buses,
ferries, planes and taxis to a virtual standstill. On Saturday,
over 322 flights were cancelled or delayed.
</P>
<P>
Victor formed in the South China Sea on Thursday and appeared
to be headed for Hainan Island before changing course and bearing
down on Hong Kong. It was Upgraded to a No.3 storm at 10:00 on
Friday morning and then to a No 8 on Saturday at noon.
</P>
<P>
Weather watchers said the storm gained quickly as it approached
 Hong Kong. For just the third time in history the center of a
typhoon crossed directly over the urban area with heavy rains. Up
to 200 millimeters of rain fell in Hong Kong by midnight between
Saturday and today.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon Victor passed between Hong Kong Island and Lantau
Island at about 08:00 on Saturday evening, and then crossed the
Tsing Ma Bridge before making landfall near Tsuen Wan.
</P>
<P>
At the Hong Kong International Airport, more than 320 flights
were affected. Among them, 49 incoming flights were cancelled, 84
delayed and 30 diverted. For departure, 68 flights were cancelled
and 91 delayed.
</P>
<P>
The Local authorities suspended all bus, ferry and tram
services by 19:30 on Saturday, while the open sections of the Mass
 Transit Railway were closed half an hour earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Kowloon-Canton Railway suspended services at the same time,
 while the Light Rail Transit services were suspended from 20:30
on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, two east-bound lanes of Wong Chuk Hang Road were
closed near the Grantham Hospital due to dangerous scaffolding,
while Cooper Road, Happy Valley, and Island Road were closed due
to a tree fall as were Shaouson Hill Road, Aberdeen and the Shek
O-bound Tai Tam Road.
</P>
<P>
There were also reports of flooding, landslip, fallen trees,
dangerous signboards or concrete plaster and dangerous
scaffoldings and canopies.
</P>
<P>
The Home Affairs Department of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) has opened 39 shelters in various
districts. Early this morning, 312 people were reportedly using
the facilities.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Degradation Causes Loss to India Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- India is losing at least 10
percent of its national income due to environmental degradation,
said a latest study by the Tata Energy Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The study report, which focuses on the state of India's natural
resources between 1947-1997, is slated to be released by Prime
Minister Inder Kumar Gujral on August 6, a government official
said today.
</P>
<P>
On the 50th anniversary of India's Independence later this
month, the availability of fresh water has declined by two-thirds
over the past 50 years, the area covered by soil degradation has
increased by almost 80 million hectares, spelling doom for
agricultural productivity.
</P>
<P>
The area covered by forests has increased by four percent but
half of it is covered by low crown-density or degraded forests.
Livestock grazing in the forests is three times the desirable
level and cultivated land per capita has halved, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The over-exploitation of groundwater is an acute problem in the
agriculturally important districts, where production is expected
to be severely hit, as costs of extracting water from a falling
groundwater table go up. The annual agricultural output is also
being hit by rapid soil degradation which has already consumed a
whopping 57 percent of the country's area.
</P>
<P>
Apart from soil erosion, waterlogging, salinization and
nutrient depletion are responsible for a loss of up to 26 percent
of the annual agricultural output today, the study said.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir to Consider Meeting Soros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today he would consider meeting American
financier George Soros whom he had identified as the "rogue
speculator" for manipulating currencies in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Well, I will certainly consider it (meeting Soros)," Mahathir
said when asked to comment on a New Straits Times report today
that Soros, in an interview with the paper in New York, sought to
meet Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
Soros also denied his company had made speculative attacks on
several ASEAN currencies including Malaysia's ringgit.
</P>
<P>
"We'll find out what he wants to explain," Mahathir said after
seeing off his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif at the Kuala
Lumpur International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said earlier that his government had definite evidence
that the pressure on the ringgit and other ASEAN currencies was
caused by Soros.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper report, Soros said he would like to
meet Mahathir, possibly in November when he addresses the
International Monetary Fund-World Bank meeting in Hong Kong, to
discuss in a public forum their differences.
</P>
<P>
However, Soros made it clear that he had no desire to do battle
with Mahathir despite their differences, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has set up an Energy
Regulation Board (ERB) to ensure the smooth and orderly operation
of the energy setor of the country, Sunday Times of Zambia
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The board was launched here Saturday by Energy and Water
Development Minister Suresh Desai.
</P>
<P>
When launching the board, Desai said that the board is
entitled to a grant from the government and that this has already
been catered for by a provision of 106 million kwacha (about
81,500 U.S Dollars) in the 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
He said that he expected the board headed by Raphael
Salasini,the Chairman and Director of the private sector, to
address the major concerns facing the energy sector related to
shortage, handling, transportation and sale of petroleum
products.
</P>
<P>
"It is also my expectation that the board will be instrumental
in the strict enforcement of housekeeping standards in the energy
sector, and ensuring that only credible investors were allowed to
participate in this vitally important sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
The board will look at the impact of energy on the environment
and will work closely with the Environmental Council of Zambia to
ensure environmental standards are strictly adhered to in the
sector.

KAMPALA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police have been put on
full alert since last Wednesday when thugs threw a grenade at
civilians near Kibuye in the capital Kampala, the local daily
''The New Vision'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public rally held last evening in Fort Portal,
southwestern Uganda, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said,

wrath of the country's security agencies."
</P>
<P>
He assured the people that the government troops will soon
wipe out the Ugandan rebels of the Allied Democratic Force (ADF).
</P>
<P>
Local mass media held that consecutive grenade attacks at
Kibuye, Natete and Nakulabye in the capital were committed by
ADF.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Defence Amama Mbabazi said
yesterday that so far the grenade attack issue has been a police
matter, but if the situation escalates, the Ugandan army is ready
to involve in.
</P>
<P>
Army Commander Mugisha Muntu yesterday met senior army
officers during which they discussed the grenade attacks, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Two people have so far been arrested in connection with the
attacks in which at least 10 people have died and 72 others

<HEADLINE> Over 90,000 Zimbabwean Workers Lose Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Over 90,000 Zimbabwean workers
have lost their jobs in the construction industry due to the lull
in property development when a number of construction companies
have gone under, the Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The industry, which has not yet recovered from the recession a
couple of years ago, was dealt a further blow by the recent
action which resulted in a loss of hundreds of man hours and
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
In most of the urban centers, construction work has trickled
down to a minimum with most of the major work started some time
ago currently being done.
</P>
<P>
Oliver Chidawu, one of the leading contractors in civil and
electrical engineering who is also former President of the
Zimbabwe Building Contractors' Association, said that in general
the industry was down.
</P>
<P>
The construction industry used to employ over 120,000 workers,
Chidawu said, adding "We estimate that only about 28,000 are
employed right now".

<P>
ROMA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Patrick Quka of South Africa knocked
down Italy's Gianmaria Petriccioli twice Saturday to win the
bantaweight title fight of the World Boxing Union at San Mango
D'Aquino, Italy.
</P>
<P>
The South African's one-two punch at the beginning of the
next-to-last round ensured his win. American referee Tony Orlando
stopped the contest after one minute, 25 seconds into the 11th
round as the punch-drunk Italian was uncapable to continue the
bout after suffering two knockdowns.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Italian, appearently lacked of technique and
preciseness, was decked for the first time in the ninth round, and
was on the canvas a few seconds later.
</P>
<P>
Quka, 24, lifted his record to 20 wins and one loss after he
captured the vacant WBU title while Petriccioli's record dropped
to 10-4.

<HEADLINE> Telephone Ownership Reaches 55 Percent in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The telephone ownership in
Shanghai municipality, China's commercial and financial center,
reached 55 percent by the end of June, taking a leading position
among the Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Latest breakdowns from the Shanghai Telephone Bureau show that
telephone subscribers in the municipality rose by 336,000 in the
first six months of this year, bringing the total number of users
to 3.37 million, of which the number of telephones in residents'
houses amounted 2.5 million, accounting to 55 percent of the total
households in the city.
</P>
<P>
It took more than a century for Shanghai to extend the number
of telephone subscribers from single one in 1882 to one million in
1993. The figure doubled subsequently in three years between 1993
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also indicated that every Shanghai resident in the
first-half year dialed 450 local calls and 15 long-distance
calls. Quite a few households even installed two telephones for
their fax machines or computers.
</P>
<P>
The increase in telephone ownership has also helped change the
mix of postal services. The telegraph businesses, for instance,
went down 30 percent annually in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Shanghai is expected to add 1.2 to 1.45 million
telephones in the next three years, a net increase of 800 to 900
users per day, according to estimations of the relevant municipal
departments.

<HEADLINE> Flash Flood Hits Southern Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Flash Flood, caused by incessant
rainfall in the last three days and onrush of water from the
hills, hit Cox's Bazar district in southern Bangladesh, leaving at
least 150,000 people marooned in flood water.
</P>
<P>
Road links between Cox's Bazar and the country's second largest
city of Chittagong were cut off early Saturday as the highway went
under four feet water at Nalbila area, according to reports
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surging sea-tide caused by the monsoon depression
over the Bay inundated the low-lying areas of the district. Sea
water entered through the branches and inundated the coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
At least one thousand acres of seed beds and 20,000 acres of
standing crop are badly affected by the floods while the rivers
Matamuhuri, Bagkhali and Eadgong are flowing one feet above the
danger level.
</P>
<P>
The floods have destroyed 450 houses and damaged another 1,500,
said the local authorities, adding that they have sanctioned 20
tons of rice and 25,000 taka (about 575 U.S. dollars) in cash for
distribution among the flood affected people.

<HEADLINE> Pivotals Remain Firm on BSE Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Pivotals remained firm on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market last week mainly due to brisk
buying support by foreign institutional investors coupled with
local speculative buying.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index recovered from 4,163.53 to 4,356.55
before finishing at 4,348.32 with sizable gain of 158.51 points
compared to the previous week level of 4,189.81. The national
index also gained 68.80 points to 1,891.90 as against the previous
level of 1,823.10.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the trading sentiment turned for the better mainly
due to aggressive buying by foreign institutional investors
coupled with fresh interest shown by speculators following the
somewhat improved political situation in the country. The uptrend
was also on account of encouraging first quarter performance
announced by major companies in the country.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister

<HEADLINE> Soccer Strike Runs Into Third Week in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 2 (Xinhua) -- As the soccer strike in
Argentina entered into the third week today, the final solution to
the problem was still not in sight.
</P>
<P>
Sparked by the disarray between six players and their club in
late July, the nationwide strike was called upon by labor union
Argentine Soccer Players Guild on July 22.
</P>
<P>
The union made the decision in response to a court ruling on
July 15 that the players had to remain in the Deportivo Espanol
Club even if their contracts expired on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The judge said the players are the property of the club now 3.8
million U.S. dollars in debt, because its creditors had decided to
prevent the club from buying or selling players.
</P>
<P>
But the players, backed by the union and the Argentine Football
Association, held that their contracts should be respected and
that they were entitled to sign contracts with any club.
</P>
<P>
On July 31, the Labor Ministry declared the strike illegal but
soccer players nationwide vowed that they would not return to the
field before the six players won their freedom.

<HEADLINE> Amenities Attract Financiers to Bonded Zones in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Bonded zones will continue to be
a favourite target for foreign investment for a considerably long
period, today's Beijing based China Daily quoted Zhao Yundong,
chairman of China Association of Development Zones.
</P>
<P>
Contractual foreign investment in the first half of the year on
rise in China's 15 bonded zones, while it declined 49 per cent
nationwide from a year ago, according to Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) sources.
</P>
<P>
Many recently approved foreign-funded projects are in bonded
areas, Moftec spokesman Hu Zhaoqing said.
</P>
<P>
Bonded zones, aside from its duty-free advantage, Zhao noted,
have more preferential policies concerning foreign investment in
China.
</P>
<P>
They are especially attractive to enterprises in
export-oriented processing, he added.
</P>
<P>
The duty-free advantage become more prominent after the removal
of the tariff-exemption on imported capital goods for enterprises
established after April 1, 1996, commented another trade expert
who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
Another major advantage of the bonded zones is that the trade
and investment climate there are similar to those of free ports
and international practices, the expert added.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign investors favoured bonded zones because they
are in coastal areas where the economy is comparably developed and
the consumption ability is relatively high.
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 bonded zones, five are in the economic and
technology development zones, seven are in the special economic
zones.
</P>
<P>
Besides the geographical advantages, highly developed
expressways, airports and sea ports contribute to the prosperity
of the 15 bonded zones.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly improving infrastructure also draws foreign
investors, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone, established in June 1990, is
the oldest and biggest bonded zone in China. Other renowned ones
include Shenzhen Futian, Shenzhen Yantian and Zhuhai bonded zones.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate the number of foreign-funded projects and
foreign investment hit record highs last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, more than 7,000 foreign-funded
enterprises had been set up in China's bonded zones, involving 8.2
billion US dollars of foreign investment. The foreign trade volume
of the bond zones totalled 6.3 billion US dollars.

partnerships with its neighboring countries, friendly countries,
European countries and the United States, Mejdani said.
</P>
<P>
Nano, who led a high-level delegation to Italy to seek support
for Albania's revival, briefed participants of today's meeting
about the international conference held in Rome on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The international community pledged in Rome to help Albania
rebuild itself, but warned that Albania's new government must
restore public order and adopt sound economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the failure of so-called pyramid investment
schemes triggered months of anarchy in Albania, which led to the
fall of the Democratic Party government and the resignation of
president Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
A Socialist-led coalition government was elected in June.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani noted that the new government, now facing difficulties
left over by history and the recent chaos, had no option but look
forward and unite all forces to rebuild the country.

<HEADLINE> Child Protection Put on Agenda in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government will
include the protection of children from drug addiction, sexual and
labor abuses in a three-year plan now in the making, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is determined to stop such abuses as much as possible,
an official of the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social
Affairs was quoted as saying by the local press.
</P>
<P>
As noted by a representative of the United Nations Children's
Fund in this Vietnamese capital, child labor appeared to be a
relatively new phenomenon in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
National demographic surveys in 1989 showed that more than one
million Vietnamese children were engaged in family economic
production. Of the total, about 120,000 were hired laborers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, children account for 34.3 percent of Vietnam's total
population of about 76 million. The number of children aged
between six and 15 is about 18 million.
</P>
<P>
Up to 90 percent of Vietnamese children living in rural areas
are believed to be working with their parents in the fields.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Government Against Lowering Minimum Working Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican government has
partially vetoed a law project calling for reducing the minimum
working age from 15 to 12, labor authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Farid Ayales said the project could deprive
children between 12 to 15 of chances for education and interrupt
the natural development process needed for these youngsters.
</P>
<P>
The project, approved last week by a legislative commission, is
violating the spirit of the government policies tending to bar
children under age 15 from the labor market, Ayales said.
</P>
<P>
If enacted and the issue of work permits to adolescents
authorized, he warned, "these children will be peons all their
life, without opportunities to prepare themselves."
</P>
<P>
"To encourage infantile work is to condemn our youth to
ignorance and to expand the gap between the rich and the poor," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Mario Viquez, executive president of the National Children's
Patronage, said Costa Rica had an agreement with the International
Labor Organization to bar children under 15 from working.
</P>
<P>
Latest Statistics and Census General Direction figures show
60,000 Costa Rican children aged five to 17 are working in the
sectors of commerce, agriculture, livestock activities and
services.

<P>
YANGON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Industrial,
Spiritual and Cultural Advancement - International
(OISCA-International), a Japan-based non-governmental
organization, plans to establish agro-forests in Pakokku district,
Myanmar's Magway division.

The group has also set up an agro-forestry training school in
the Pakhangyi region, providing extensive training in a bid to
nurture a new generation of qualified Myanmar farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two New Zealand companies have been carrying out
pilot projects on tree plantations in Kalaw and Heho areas of the
country's Shan state since early last year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in forest resources with different types of
forests covering about 51 percent of the country's land area.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- China's experiment of allowing
foreign companies to deal with imports and exports will soon
expand to Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Three operate in Shanghai, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
As part of its intensified efforts to enter the World Trade
Organization, China decided to let foreigners deal with foreign
trade in Shanghai's Pudong New Area and the Shenzhen Special
Economic Zone last September.
</P>
<P>
It has approved three joint venture foreign trade companies on
a trial basis in Pudong involving four foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
China, which used to bar foreign companies from dealing imports
and exports on its turf, has promised to allow manufacturers to
undertake imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai and Shenzhen have been selected as the sites for the
vital reform.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-US OCT International Trading Co Ltd, one of the two
companies to open in Shenzhen, will be among the first four joint
venture trading houses approved by the State Council, said Liu
Guangqi, deputy director-general of Shenzhen Trade Development
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The other is pending approval from the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec).
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the Shenzhen party owns a 51 per cent stake with
the remaining 49 per cent to be shared by the foreign partners,
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-US OCT International Trading Co Ltd is to be a joint
venture between Shenzhen OCT Petroleum Trading Group Corporation
and US-based Dow Trading PRC Inc.
</P>
<P>
With a planned registered capital of 100 million yuan ($12
million), the proposed company will deal with petroleum, chemical
industrial products, mechanical and electrical products, textiles
and garments.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen OTC Petroleum Trading Corp, a State trading
enterprise group with accumulative gross assets of 3.3 billion
yuan ($397.60 million) and net assets of 1.4 billion yuan ($168.70
million US dollars), has business relationships with about 40
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
US Dow Trading PRC Inc, a subsidiary of Dow Chemical Co.,
handles production and sales of raw materials, plastics and
special products.
</P>
<P>
The other pilot trading company under approval will be a joint
venture owned by the China Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and
Export Corp's Shenzhen branch and the Japan-based Nichimen Co Ltd.
</P>
<P>
With a proposed registered capital of more than 50 million yuan
($6.02 million), the pilot project will cover a wide range of
businesses including food, machinery and electronics, chemicals
and industrial products.
</P>
<P>
Liu said several other co-operative projects in Shenzhen are
applying for approval.

BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, the southernmost province

waste, including contaminated water, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The province spent 27 million yuan (3.3 million US dollars) in

completed.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 64.4 percent of the waste water is properly
treated, and 94.4 percent less gas is emitted into the air. Solid
waste production has been cut by 43.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five small paper mills and projects with severe
pollution in food and beverage, power, chemical and mining sectors
were ordered to close last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 5,630 ha of land were covered with trees and

<HEADLINE> Cloning Still Far From Sports, Says Specialist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 2 (Xinhua) -- It is still early to say
whether there will be cloning of sportsmen, according to Henrique
de Rose, president of the Sports Medicine International Federation
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian De Rose said in an interview during the Federated
Sports Congress being held in the city of Guadalajara, the capital
of the western Mexican state of Jalisco, that a long time has to
pass for world sports to face in the next century the arrival of
identical sportsmen produced by cloning.
</P>
<P>
He added that in the future genetic engineering will be used,
but that it is difficult to know today what influence it will have
on sports, and that its application still is a matter of ethics.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of cloning, he said eleven clones of a famous
sportsman could be physically identical, but they would not have
the same capacity to act nor would give the same results of the
copied original.
</P>
<P>
He spoke of the three big challenges faced by world sports in
the third millennium. The sophistication of the Olympic games
reduces the possibility of participating in any of them as a
sportsman.
</P>
<P>
Another big problem is the commercialization of sports, which
pressures sportsmen to give better results.
</P>
<P>
The third problem is the athlete's health, the search of high
yield and the excess of marketing, which produces injuries.
</P>
<P>
He said that sportsmen use doping to achieve great results,
without consideration to health. Such situation makes
international federations search for a solution. So it is
recommended that during sports activities there should be a
specialist in sports medicine.
</P>
<P>
However, the president of the International Federation of
Sports Medicine said that in the future sports will be safer for
sportsmen.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Strike Deprives Argentines of Entertainment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Argentines were deprived for
another weekend of their traditional soccer matches because of the
sixth strike of the last 66 years since the creation of
professional soccer in this country.
</P>
<P>
The labor union "Argentine Soccer Players Guild" (FAA) started
July 22 a strike of indefinite duration after the conflict that
the "Deportivo Espanol" Club had with six players, whom the club
will not let go.
</P>
<P>
The conflict started when a court decided July 15 that the six
players must continue attached to that club, even if their
contracts ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
The judge alleged that the players are the property of the
"Deportivo Espanol" club because it has a debt of 3.8 million
dollars, and because since May of 1986 it called to a meeting of
creditors, which prevents it from buying or selling players.
</P>
<P>
However, the six players claimed their contracts be respected
and also their right to freely contract with any club.
</P>
<P>
Their situation won the support of the FAA, which groups
professional soccer players in the country, and the sympathy of
the Argentine Football Association (AFA), which are mediating to
have the matches continue.
</P>
<P>
The AFA unsuccessfully requested the strike to be ended to
avoid interrupting the National Closing Tournament to be made with
the matches of August 17. The AFA proposal includes the commitment
to interrupt the 97-98 Opening Tournament if the six players are
not free to act as they desire.
</P>
<P>
Although the Labor Ministry decreed July 26 obligatory
conciliation, and on July 31 it declared the strike illegal, the
soccer players maintained their position of not resuming
activities if the six players are not declared free to contract
with any other club, defying in this way any possible economic
sanctions and the loss of the AFA juridical personality.
</P>
<P>
There have been five important strikes, apart from the present
one, during the 66 years of the professional soccer in Argentina,
caused at the beginning for the claim to the right to form a
union, later by a minimum salary, and then for the respect to the
players right to contract with any club.
</P>
<P>
Up to this moment Argentines have had two soccer-less weekends.
</P>
<P>
If the importance soccer has in the life of the Argentines is
taken into account, this strike has monopolized the attention of
all the society, to such a degree that President Carlos Menem has
received the soccer players representatives, who expressed him
their desire to end the strike.
</P>
<P>
The only way out now is the new AFA proposal of paying 3
million dollars to the "Deportivo Espanol" club creditors, then
this club releases the six players, the strike ends, and the
closing of the tournament continues.
</P>
<P>
It will be necessary until Monday to go to the judge who made
the last decision, when he returns from his winter vacation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, negotiations between AFA, FAA, and Labor Ministry
representatives continue to find a prompt solution.

<HEADLINE> Posts to Meet Savings Target With Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- China's postal savings sector
will strive to fulfil its annual growth target by speeding up the
Green Card projects, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
It plans to increase savings by 40 billion yuan (4.8 billion US
dollars) this year, but savings rose just 16.7 billion yuan (2
billion US dollars) in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown was attributed to the overheated stock market and
the issue of huge amounts of treasury bonds, the paper quoted Wang
Yunpeng, deputy director of the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications' Directorate-General of Posts as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the postal savings sector would not adjust its annual
goal, adding "we must make more efforts to reach the target."
</P>
<P>
One way will be accelerating the Green Card project, which aims
to link the country's post offices so customers can deposit or
withdraw money at any branch.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,547 post offices in 50 cities will be linked through
computers by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, 10,000 post offices in all cities
above the county level will be linked.
</P>
<P>
Investment is expected to reach four billion yuan (481.9
million US dollars). About 1.75 billion yuan (210.8 million US
dollars) had been invested by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
China started the postal savings business in 1919, but the
business was suspended from 1950 to 1986. It expanded quickly in
the past decade and the postal savings system is facing big
changes.
</P>
<P>
Wang went on to say that the ministry, the central bank and
related departments were studying detailed reform plans that are
expected to be fixed in the second half of this year.
