<P>
XIAMEN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Jimei University in east
China's port city of Xiamen has witnessed steady growth over the
past three years, according to the university's board of trustees
which met today.
</P>
<P>
The university was established in October 1994 at the last
request of Chen Jiageng, a patriotic overseas Chinese, who passed
away in 1961.
</P>
<P>
During his lifetime, he made donations to start educational
undertakings including kindergartens and vocational schools in his
hometown and Xiamen University, and financed 70 other primary and
middle schools in Fujian, in an effort to train more useful people
for the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, local governments have earmarked 102
million yuan (about 12.8 million US dollars) to the university for
its development. In addition, the city government has offered more
than 50 million yuan in subsidies to the school staff and students.
</P>
<P>
The school, with 68 majors in liberal arts, science and
engineering, has more than 7,300 students and over 2,300 employees.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that a new campus with a planned area of 600,000
sq.m. is under construction, and a computer center and a language
center are already in operation.

<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- At the ongoing "Glorious Five
Year Exhibition" in Beijing, a large photograph of late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping hangs over the entrance of the room reserved
for the accomplishments of Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The material in the room is divided into four categories: the
new look of Sichuan Province; the glorious achievements of the
past five years; the great development of the whole society; and
Sichuan's bright future.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan covers an area of 485,000 sq km and has a population of
83.57 million. The 1996 gross domestic product in the southwest
province reached 298.5 billion yuan (36 billion US dollars),
accounting for 31.29 percent of the total GDP of the ten western
provinces and regions.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has placed much emphasis on the
construction of more highways and railways in the past five years,
and great achievements have been made to make the province more
accessible to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The operation of the expressway between Chengdu and Chongqing
has initiated the construction of more high-grade expressways
across the province.
</P>
<P>
With the construction of the railways between Daxian and
Chengdu, Baoji and Chengdu, and the renovation of the railway
between Chengdu and Kunming, Sichuan is one of the regions in
China to have a high number of railways under construction at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
Shuangliu Airport at Chengdu has become the fourth-largest
international airport in China.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Cancels Faulty GSP certificates under EU pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government today
decided to cancel irregular certificates whose holders enjoyed the
General System of Preference (GSP) facility in exporting garments
to the European market.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a meeting today of the Cabinet
Committee on the GSP Problem headed by Finance Minister Shah AMS
Kibria, according to an official press release.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, the European Union (EU) threatened to
withdraw the GSP facility if Dhaka fails to cancel the inaccurate
GSP certificates by October 1.
</P>
<P>
The deadline was set by the EU after the Bangladeshi government
failed to take any measures to cancel 6,910 GSP certificates
which, an EU investigation team found late last year, were not
issued in compliance with the rules of origin.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's garment industry, the country's biggest hard
currency earner, has been enjoying duty-free or low-duty treatment
under the GSP facility in the European market without any quota
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
However, the products must be made of indigenous materials to
get these privileges, which give the country's garment industry an
edge over its competitors.
</P>
<P>
Following complaints that the rules of origin clause are being
violated, the EU required Dhaka to cancel those alleged faulty
certificates. That would make the local exporters liable to pay
millions of U.S. dollars as an indirect compensation.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the cabinet committee took the final
decision after heated debate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The committee also said in the press release that it was the
government's firm policy to extend all possible help to promote
the country's export industries.

million kilowatts, accounting for one-fourth of the country's
total reserve.
</P>
<P>
The development of water energy resources has been the
province's investment and construction focus for the past five
years. The recently-completed Ertan hydropower station, which has
a capacity of 3.3 million kilowatts, is now the biggest hydropower
station ever built in China in this century.
</P>
<P>
The province has emerged as the country's third biggest grain
producer after breaking its harvest record four times. It has
also become the largest vegetable producer in west China.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of Changhong Electronics Corporation,
Panzhihua Steel and Iron Corporation, and the China Oriental
Electric Corporation have greatly enhanced the province's
industrial strength, and given it a sharper market edge.
</P>
<P>
Also in the exhibit is an experimental magnetic suspension
train which has drawn the attention of most visitors. It was
donated to the show by Southwest Communications University in
Sichuan, and is the only such train designed exclusively by

world to grasp this kind of high technology.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province has gathered the country's research force in
the field of space, aeronautics, nuclear power, electronics, and
biological technology. The Xichang satellite-launching base has

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today strongly rejected Israel's threats to raid
the PNA territories in case of pursuing terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC) quoted PNA
President Yasser Arafat's Information Advisor Nabil Abu Rodaineh
as saying in Gaza that "Palestinians will not accept such Israeli
practices and we have full rights to defend our lands, authority
and our religious sites."
</P>
<P>
Preparing for the unexpected raids by the Israeli military
forces, Palestinians are mobilized to set up road blocks at the
entrances of the cities, towns and villages of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Following Thursday's bombings in Jerusalem's pedestrian mall
which killed seven people, the Israeli government criticized PNA
for failing to crack down on terrorism and threatened to raid the
PNA territories in case of pursuing terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces reimposed the total closure on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip after Thursday's bombings which were carried out by
Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out any
peace negotiations with the Palestinians unless the PNA fights
against the terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Canada Takes Steps to Prevent Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Canadian farmers will no longer
be permitted to feed their cattle, sheep and goats ground-up bits
of other ruminants, the government has announced.
</P>
<P>
Canada changed the regulations because of public health
concerns about the so-called mad cow disease, or Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE), a report said today.
</P>
<P>
The new steps are "necessary to safeguard Canada's animal
health status and maintain domestic and international confidence
in the safety of Canadian animal products," said Dr. Graham
Clarke, official at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
</P>
<P>
Canada has had only one case of mad cow disease, in a herd of
Alberta cattle which was destroyed in 1993, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization requests that all countries ban
the feeding of ruminant tissue to ruminants because of Britain's
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Research in Britain has linked cattle feed containing ground
bone and body parts from sheep with the appearance of
brain-wasting BSE in cows in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Before the latest ban, ground-up bits of ruminants often made
up 20 percent or more of cattle feed in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulations, feed manufacturers and farmers are
also required to take steps to avoid cross-contamination when
mixing feed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, all products containing banned materials should be
clearly identified under the new labeling requirements.

TEHRAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Parliament
Vice-Speaker Movahedi Kermani declared here today that Iran will
continue to support Palestinians in their struggle against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Kermani said that the setback suffered by the Israelis in
southern Lebanon carried important messages for the Palestinian
nation, Arab states, the United States and the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the open session of the Iranian Parliament, he
said that the defeat of the Israeli commandos in southern
Lebanon would one day lead to the total collapse of the Israeli
regime.
</P>
<P>
A special Israeli naval squad was ambushed by Hezbollah forces
early Friday morning near a village between Sidon and Tyre in
South Lebanon while on their way to carry out a raid mission.
</P>
<P>
Eleven commandos were killed, another soldier went missing,
presumed dead, and four others wounded in the fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
Kermani said that the defeat had the message for the
Palestinian nation that they should further resist the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He warned that those Arab countries, which are willing to
maintain their friendship with Israel, should know that they
would face strong reactions from their respective nations.
</P>
<P>
Kermani said the United States should know that the era of
bullying and hegemony is over and world peoples are now seeking
justice.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement only days before U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright is due to begin her first tour of the

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis today warned Turkey that any change of the existing status
quo in Cyprus by Ankara would mean war for Athens.
</P>
<P>
"Greece will go to war if Turkey attempts to overturn the
existing status quo in Cyprus," Simitis sounded the warning at a
press conference following the opening of the annual Thessaloniki
international trade fair in northern Greece today.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Greece backed the deployment of Russian-made
S-300 surface-to-air missiles in Cyprus because the island had the
right to enhance its defense capability.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Athens supported a proposal by Cypriot
President Glafkos Clerides calling for the island's
demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot side declared unilaterally a
breakaway state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which
has only been recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to unite with northern Cyprus if the
Cyprus government begins membership talks with the European Union
(EU). The EU has invited Cyprus to begin accession talks early
next year.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Turkey and northern Cyprus has signed a partial
integration pact which has already resulted in strong criticizism
from Greece.

NAIROBI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for Tourism
and Wildlife Protas Momanyi is now on a tourism campaign trip to
the United Kingdom to reassure British tourists that Kenya is a
safe destination for holiday makers, the Kenya News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The minister who left here on Saturday with a high-level
delegation, is scheduled to meet officials of British travel
agencies to brief them on the security situation in the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
Momanyi will also attend the 67th World Congress of the
American Society for Travel Agents scheduled to start on Monday
in Glasgow, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The minister's promotion campaign in Britain is reportedly
aimed at preventing further decline in tourist arrivals following
the recent violence in Kenya's Coast Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 45 Kenyans have been killed in the continuous
violence in the port city of Mombasa and its environs since
August 13 when unidentified armed gangsters attacked police
stations at Likoni area.
</P>
<P>
The violence has dealt a serious blow to the country's tourism
industry, which is the biggest foreign exchange earner for Kenya.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least 5,000 tourists arrive in Mombasa
weekly during this season, but now the number has fallen
drastically by 30 to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
More than 15 charter flights land at the Moi International
Airport in Mombasa every week. But many of the fully booked
flights have been cancelled after the Likoni violence.
</P>
<P>
Kenya received 770,000 tourists last year and the tourism
industry earned the country 480 U.S. Dollars in foreign exchange.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's First Lady Stresses Women's Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's first lady
Anna Mkapa today stressed the importance of women's education in
the country, which she said is the pivot of economic development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a school fund-raising function in Arusha, northern
Tanzania, Mkapa underscored the urge for women's education to be
undertaken seriously at all levels as the only means to improve
the well-being of women in the country.
</P>
<P>
Parents have shown very little concern on the importance of
women's education, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The country's 1994 statistics showed that only 45.8 percent of
girl students in primary schools were selected for secondary
schools.
</P>
<P>
More specifically, Mkapa said, 43.4 percent of girls joined
form one of primary education in 1994. Only 31.6 percent of them
reached form four and 27.1 percent of the number completed form
six.
</P>
<P>
As for girl students in universities, the first lady said,
they accounted for an average of 19 percent of the total and
those who joined technical colleges took up 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Women's education is neglected not only in Tanzania, but in
the whole Africa, Mkapa added.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstance, Mkapa urged the government, the
international organizations and local community to relate the
well-being of women with education.

group Hamas.
</P>
<P>

Hamas has claimed responsibility for the bomb attack, and a
previous dual bombing on July 30 in Jerusalem which killed 17
people.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday bombing, which killed seven people, overshadowed
the upcoming maiden trip by the United States' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to reactivate the stalled Middle East peace
process.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Launches Air Raid in Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG today launched air raid at the port of
Freetown in an exercise to enforce embargo on Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG aircraft this afternoon dropped two bombs, one of which
exploded and destroyed 10 vessels at the port, according to the
British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
No casualty figures are available at press time.
</P>
<P>
The air raid was targeted at unidentified vessels carrying
foodstuffs to Sierra Leone, which was under an economic embargo
imposed by west African countries.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG issued a statement on Friday, warning all ships and
aircraft to keep off the territorial waters and airspace of
Sierra Leone, where soldiers overthrew the legitimate government
in a coup in May.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG statement threatened to take military actions
against violators of the embargo, which was approved by the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) at its 20th
summit last weekend.
</P>
<P>
However, the military junta in Freetown refused the ECOWAS
decision, asserting that Sierra Leone is a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
A junta spokesman strongly condemned ECOMOG's air raid and
said the military regime had vowed to reinforce security at the
port.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's militia group known as Kamajors today
also launched an unsuccessful attack on the government soldiers
on a highway in southeast Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
A leader of the Kamajors, composed of traditional hunters,
said the attack was aimed to clear the area so that refugees from
neighboring Liberia who fled their country during the seven-year
civil war could easily go home.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes EU Ambassadors Back to Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi tonight issued a positive signal to the European
countries, saying that EU ambassadors are welcome back to
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted the foreign minister as
saying that "EU ambassadors could return to Tehran any time at
their pleasure."
</P>
<P>
However, he did not mention any pre-conditions for the return
of the EU ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
Iran had insisted earlier that German ambassador should
return to his post at the tail of any return by EU envoys to
Iran -- a condition Germany views as an unacceptable "divide and
conquer" tactic.
</P>
<P>
But, Kharrazi warned that "European governments would do
better not to opt for unconventional decisions in their dealings
with Iran."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said during a brief visit to Tehran by EU envoy
Paul Meurtz Friday and Saturday, he had informed him of the
position of Iran on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy held two rounds of talks with Iranian Foreign
Ministry's Director General for Western Europe Ali Ahani in a
bid to solve the four-month diplomatic crisis between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that EU governments are now studying their
response. "Iran expected some change and revision in the
attitude of the EU toward Iran," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Kharrazi did not elaborate what the new stance Iran
has adopted toward the EU.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Greece, all the EU countries recalled
their ambassadors home from Tehran after the Berlin Court last
April implicated top Iranian leaders in the killing of three
Kurdish dissidents and their translator in Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
As a measure to punish Iran, EU also decided not to hold
bilateral ministerial-level meetings between Iran and any EU
member state.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes Albright Resuscitates Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today expressed the hope that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's visit to the region would help reactivate the
stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Seating the Palestinians and Israelis on the negotiating table
is the required action," he told the press at the airport after
the departure of King Hussein of Jordan and Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat who joined President Hosni
Mubarak for a tripartite summit here today.
</P>
<P>
The only solution is that Palestinians and Israelis sit
together, negotiate and implement all the signed agreements, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Mubarak will contact with Arab leaders within the
coming days to brief them over the outcome of today's tripartite
summit.
</P>
<P>
Today's urgent summit was called to coordinate Arab stance
before Albright's first trip as the Secretary of State to the
region this week in the wake of Thursday's triple suicide bombing
in Jerusalem and the reimposition of tight Israeli closure on
Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released at the end of their two-and-half-hour
meeting, the three Arab leaders called on Washington to double its
efforts to salvage the jeopardized peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that a unified Arab position has actually existed
on the basis the Olso agreements.
</P>
<P>
Moussa blamed the Israeli policy for the recent wave of
terrorist attacks and called on the Israeli government to
re-assess its policies that "have given birth to many acts of
violence."
</P>
<P>
"The peace process did not deteriorate a few days or weeks
ago, but that its collapse was born to an Israeli policy that has
shattered the trust of Palestinian people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority and its people cannot be
held responsible for the current situation, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the PNA nor Arafat has given the green light to any
acts of violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's threats not to
implement the troop redeployment in occupied territories or to
attack the Palestinian self rule areas, Moussa said that such
warnings have a negative impact of no benefit.
</P>
<P>
Albright is expected to revive the Palestinian-Israeli
peacemaking that has been in crisis since March over Jewish
settlement construction on the land the Palestinians want as part
of a future state.
</P>
<P>
The stalemate has been deepened by the suicide attacks in
Jerusalem, first on July 30 when two human bombs killed 15
Israelis and now on last Thursday when seven were killed by a
triple bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
Israel has held the PNA "indirectly responsible" for the
attacks and reimposed a complete closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip which had been eased earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
After the bombing, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out
handing over more land to Palestinians Friday until Arafat cracked
down on Muslim militants, accusing him of failing to honor a
commitment under interim peace accords to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israel has redeployed its troops, handing over much of the Gaza
Strip and parts of the West Bank to Palestinian self-rule under
peace deals with Arafat starting in 1993. It is supposed to
withdraw from more of the West Bank in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
In today's press statement, the three leaders condemn terrorism
and the use of violence targeting innocent civilians and said that
violence runs contrary to the spirit of peace.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries that have
diplomatic ties with Israel and played important roles in peace
mediation.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President: Dialog Is Key to Kashmir Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami today expressed the hope that the disputes on the issue of
Kashmir can be solved through negotiations between India and
Pakistan, Iranian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the remark while meeting with the visiting Indian
Minister of State for External Affairs Saleem Iqbal Shervani who
arrived here Friday for a visit.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Shervani delivered a message of the Indian
Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral to Khatami and briefed him on
progress in talks between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said both the Indian and Pakistan leaders are determined to
solve their disputes peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Kashmir, with an area of 220,000 square kilometers, locates in
the northern part of the Indian sub-continent. Both India and
Pakistan claim sovereignty over the area. The two countries have
fought three wars over the land and India is controlling two-thirds
of the area and Pakistan the rest.
</P>
<P>
Lauding the role of Iran and India in the regional cooperation
and in helping the Central Asian republics, Khatami said that
continued cooperation between the two countries will serve to cut
off the hands of aliens from that region and guarantee those
republics' independence.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed satisfaction with growing ties between Tehran
and New Delhi, saying "since we consider tranquility and peace to
be in the interests of regional states, we are ready to do all
within our power to improve relations among regional countries."
</P>
<P>
On bilateral ties, Shervani said that India is ready to
further expand its cooperation with Iran in economic, political
and cultural fields.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Minister Arrives for SADC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLANTYRE, Malawi, September 7 (Xinhua )-- Angolan Minister of
Construction P. de Castro Vandunen arrived here today on behalf
of President Eduardo Dos Santos to attend the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) summit to be held Monday, a liaison
officer with the summit said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sudden change of Angolan leader for the SADC summit was
made this morning, said SADC liaison officer Diana Nkhulembe,
adding that the reason for the change was not available.
</P>
<P>
Angola, which has been devastated by more than two decades of
civil war, is said to have been urging for the southern African
group's help in bringing final peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
"SADC is interested in bringing a final peace into Angola,"
said Alfred Nzo, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the
sub-regional group.
</P>
<P>
The SADC countries, all members of the United Nations, have
been helping Angola for a final peace through their strict
observance of the United Nations resolutions over the peace
process in the country, Nzo said today.
</P>
<P>
The group members have observe the UN sanctions in late August
to prevent the entry into or transit through their territories of
all senior officials of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA ) and of adult members of their
immediate families, he said.
</P>
<P>
They have been required by the UN resolution to close
immediately and completely all UNITA offices in their countries.
</P>
<P>
SADC members also express their readiness to consider the
imposition of additional measures with UN, such as trade and
financial restrictions, if UNITA does not fully comply with its
obligations under the Lusaka Peace Accord signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
SADC has been urging for direct talks between Angolan
President Dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the former
rebel movement UNITA, which will contribute to the reduction of
tensions and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The immediate challenge facing SADC is to maintain democracy,
peace and security, so as to create an atmosphere of confidence
and trust in and among the member states, said Nelson Mandela,
SADC chairman and South African President.
</P>
<P>
SADC has established an organ on politics, defense and
security, a mechanism for peace and stability in the region.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Romanian Presidents Hold Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
meeting here today with Romanian President Emil Constantinescu,
said China is ready to join hands with Romania to lead a sound and
comprehensive Sino-Romanian friendship into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two leaders expressed their satisfaction
with the smooth development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that although the world's political situation has
fluctuated constantly in recent years and great changes have taken
place in China and Romania, the friendship between the two
countries has stood the test of time.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have seen frequent high-level contacts, and
supported each other and coordinated closely in international
affairs, he said, adding that bilateral relations have been
increasingly strengthened in politics, economics, culture, and
education.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president contributed the long-term Sino-Romanian
friendship to the efforts made by the two sides in overcoming
their differences in ideology and maintaining mutual respect,
equal treatment, mutual understanding and support.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China and Romania, without a radical conflict of
interests between them, share common goals of safeguarding world
peace and promoting economic development.
</P>
<P>
To uphold Sino-Romanian friendship is not only the consensus of
the leaders of the two countries but also the common aspiration of
their peoples, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang cited Romania as an important partner in the region of
the central and eastern Europe, saying that China has all along
attached great significance to developing relations with Romania.
</P>
<P>
China respects Romania's development road and its foreign and
domestic policies, and supports what it has done in maintaining
its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said.
</P>
<P>
China, he went on, is willing to develop a long-term, stable
and all-round relationship with Romania on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said that Romania places great importance on its
ties with China and one of its foreign policy goals is to forge a
new, long-term and close partnership with China.
</P>
<P>
China is a great political and economic power in the world, he
said, and Romania hopes to tighten its links with China in these
areas, and hopes to understand China's views on some major issues
that face the people of the world, so as to make joint efforts for
the development of the humankind, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Romania believes there is only one China in
the world and the People's Republic of China is the sole legal
government representing the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Romania keeps to the one China stand and will not establish
and develop any form of official ties with Taiwan, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for the Tibet issue, he said, Romania won't do anything to
harm the interests of the Chinese people.

<P>
On economic and trade relations, Jiang said the Chinese
Government attaches importance to the development of economic and
trade links with Romania.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries have a sound basis for economic
and trade links. Noting that the two countries have undergone
great changes in their economic and trade systems in recent years,
he said that both sides can adopt some practical and effective
measures to establish multi-level, multi-channel links and develop
flexible direct cooperation in all forms.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the two sides should actively explore all
forms of economic and technological cooperation and push forward
the progress of bilateral trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the convinction that he is confident that
through joint efforts, the two countries will be able to elevate
economic and trade cooperation to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu briefed Jiang about Romania's economic growth
and its long-term plan for foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the two countries have a great potential
for expanding economic and trade cooperation. He said that
relevant departments of the two countries will further explore new
forms and ways of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Romania welcomes China to invest in the country, and Romania
holds that the expansion of economic and trade cooperation between
the two countries is in the interests of the two peoples, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also exchanged views on the international
situation, which Jiang said is undergoing enormous and profound
changes.
</P>
<P>
There is an accelerating tendency toward multi-polarization,
and the tendency toward independence and self-sufficiency is on
the rise in every country in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
More and more countries have come to the same conclusion that
they should encourage dialogue and cooperation instead of
confrontation and conflict.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that there are still factors of instability
and that peace and development are facing challenges.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China pursues an independent foreign policy of
peace, Jiang said China and Romania have identical or similar
views on many major international issues, and China is ready to
continue to step up its discussion and cooperation with Romania on
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said that Romania places importance on China's
role in the international community and its stance on major
international issues. He said that Romania is ready to regularly
exchange views on international issues and develop mutual support
with China.
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening, Jiang hosted a banquet in honor of
President Constantinescu and his party in the Great Hall of the
People.

<HEADLINE> Intel's New Chips to Reach Retail Customers First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Intel Corporation, the
world's largest chip producer, will ship its newest generation of
microprocessor chips today to retail customers first.
</P>
<P>
Chain stores like CompUSA, instead of corporations like
Hewlett-Packard, will become the first to see the new chips,
according to a report by the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The new chip, the latest in the Pentium line, contains the
smallest transistors Intel has ever made for commercial sale. As a
result, it packs more of these transistors -- the switches that
control the flow of electrical impulses in the circuitry -- into a
smaller space than ever before.
</P>
<P>
The new technology provides computer users with twin benefits:
Their machines can perform more functions faster while using up to
50 percent less power. This makes the new chips especially useful
in small, battery-powered portable computers -- the
fastest-growing segment of the computer industry, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The new processors, operating at 200 and 233 megahertz with the
company's MMX multimedia technology, are the first products made
using Intel's most advanced manufacturing technology. The circuit
lines on the chip are 0.25 microns wide; more than 300 of them set
side by side would barely equal the width of a human hair.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The MCI Communications Inc.,
the second largest player in the U.S. telecommunication service,
said that it had reduced its Sunday rate on state-to-state
long-distance calls to 5 cents a minute, effective from September
7.
</P>
<P>
"Sunday is the day that Americans call the most," said John
Donoghue, MCI senior vice president of consumer marketing. "Every
MCI residential customer automatically receives the industry's
best long-distance rate -- 5 cents a minute -- on top of their
regular MCI savings."
</P>
<P>
The new rates also apply to calls to Canada.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear whether the AT&AMP;T Corporation, the Sprint
Corporation and other long-distance companies will offer similar
discounts.
</P>
<P>
MCI, headquartered in Washington, D.C., made its 1996 revenues
18.5 billion U.S. dollars. MCI is the world's third largest
carrier of international voice traffic.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year MCI plans to merge with British Telecom

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's Second
Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Prince Sultan Ibn
Abdul-Aziz will start a four-day official visit to Italy Tuesday,
the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported today.
</P>

<P>
During his visit, Prince Sultan is expected to meet Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Prodi, Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini and other officials for talks on boosting bilateral
cooperation.

years last July during which he and Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz tackled means of boosting economic, trade and
investment cooperation between the two countries and agreed to
exchange visits in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed that the collapse of the Middle
East peace process would threaten the region's security and
peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Italy last September signed a cooperation and
investment protection agreement and the two countries have also
been linked by a security pact since December 1995, which
stipulates joint cooperation in combating organized crimes, drugs
smuggling and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between Saudi Arabia and Italy in 1995 amounted
to 3.2 billion U.S. dollars with a 747 million dollars of surplus
in favor of Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Somali Militiamen Clash over Narcotic Leaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed
and four others were wounded when armed militiamen among the
supporters of Hussein Mohamed Aidid exchanged heavy fire at Afgoe
road near the Somali capital Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said, the shooting began when a convoy of
vehicles transporting khat were refused access to reach the
capital Mogadishu by militiamen at a check point near the
strategic K-7 junction.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness told the reporters that two people died on the
spot when the militiamen at the check point managed to snatch the
khat cargo off one of the trucks transporting the narcotic
leaves. The check point was immediately deserted after the
militiamen ran away with their booty.
</P>
<P>
Annoyed by the fatalities and material loss, the militiamen
escorting the drug khat angrily attacked two other vehicles
suspected to have belonged to the same clan of the robbers,
killing a man and wounding three others at the former maintenance
factory on the industrial street in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Despite the incident, the road remains open for the traffic
today following the intervention of local elders who succeeded in
dismantling the newly erected check point. The elders also
discussed ways to prevent the repetition of such incidents.
</P>
<P>
This is the third attack against the khat convoys in the same
area between the former maintenance factory and the K-7 junction
within two weeks. The khat fighting has claimed the lives of more
than eight militiamen in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
In another development, North Mogadishu faction leader Ali
Mahdi Mohamed, hosted in North Mogadishu today a rally attended
by politicians and traditional leaders returned from a meeting in
South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the headquarters of Ali Mahdi said, the
politicians and elders led by Abdulqasim Salad Hassan, former
interior minister of late Siad Barre's government, and Intellect
Ahmed Rage, former mayor of Mogadishu, discussed ways of
restoring confidence among the Somali people so as to pave the
way for national reconciliation.
</P>

leader Hussein Aidid and some of his senior officials as well as
representatives of Osman Hassan Ali Atto near Bosnia, Somalia,

were made at a strategy workshop in January#and endorsed by the
SADC Council of Ministers in Windhoek, Namibia in February, on
integrating gender considerations into the work of the
sub-regional group.
</P>
<P>
In a foreword to the book, South African President Nelson
Mandela, Chairman of SADC, declares that "As leaders of SADC, we
recognize that freedom cannot be achieved unless women attain
equality, respect and dignity through their full participation in
every respect of our regional endeavor."
</P>
<P>
Gertrude Mongella, chairperson of the U.N. Fourth World
Conference on Women, said today as an honored guest at the
summit, that SADC women and men who have fought side by side
against colonialism and apartheid, need to conquer the last
frontier of gender inequality in the region.
</P>
<P>
She said, to a round of warm applause, that women should be
taken as a force of peace on the continent, stressing that the
message from African women against war is: "Enough is enough."
</P>
<P>
While some SADC members have made progress toward gender
equality, disparity between men and women still exists in the
areas of legal rights, power sharing and decision making, access
to and control over productive resources, education and health,
said the book.
</P>
<P>
SADC is aiming at a goal of 30 percent of women in political
and decision making structure by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The book urged members of the sub-regional group to reform
all laws, amend constitutions and change social practices which
"still subject women to discrimination."
</P>
<P>
SADC is one of the few regional organizations in Africa and
the world which formally recognizes the importance of gender
equality to the achievement of its twin objectives of democracy
and development.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional group which aims at a fully developed common
market by the year 2000, have 12 members, namely Angola,
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South
Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Organizing Committee of
the '97 China Investment and Trade Talks today held a symposium
for businessmen from Taiwan to discuss the expansion of
economic and trade relationship across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 Taiwan entrepreneurs, headed by Xu Shengfa,
Chairman of the Board of the Taiwan Industrial and Commercial
Federation, attended the meeting, which was jointly sponsored by
the federation and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Li Bingcai, deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council, delivered a speech, saying "people on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait have the same origin. We take the firm position, as
always, that economic exchanges and cooperation should be
developed on the basis of equality and mutual benefit."
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, the mainland has taken a series of measures to
promote exchanges and cooperation across the strait. "Though being
blocked by some manmade obstacles, economic cooperation between
the island and mainland is still surging forward," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of June, the total trade volume
across the strait had reached 105.3 billion US dollars, with more
than 30,000 Taiwan-funded enterprises founded on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation could be increased in the agriculturial and energy
sectors, as well as in reforms of the mainland's state-run
enterprises," said Li, adding that businessmen from Taiwan will
find more opportunities in the regions of central and west China.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the issue of Taiwan investors' rights and interests
on the mainland, he repeated, "their legal rights will surely be
protected by laws and regulations worked out by governments at all
levels over the past decades."
</P>
<P>
Li also talked about direct linkage across the strait. "It will
greatly benefit economic and trade development on both sides. We
shall, as always, work toward its realization,"
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Sun Zhenyu, Deputy Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and businessmen from 26
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.

<HEADLINE> Monitoring Committee Meets to Consider Lebanon's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The five-nation committee
monitoring the cease-fire in south Lebanon met today in Naqoura on
the Israeli-Lebanese border to consider complaints lodged by
Lebanon and Israel against each other following last Friday's
fierce battle.
</P>
<P>
It is the 25th such meeting since the committee was established
under the truce accord reached in April, 1996 to end a 16-day
Israeli blitz of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Lebanon lodged a complaint, accusing Israel of
launching a commando raid last Friday on Lebanon in which a
Lebanese woman was killed and six civilians wounded, Lebanese
radio Voice of People reported.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Israel condemned Lebanon in its complaint
that last Saturday Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
killed an Israeli army officer in its attack on an Israeli troops
position in south Lebanon, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
It would take several days before the representatives of the
monitoring committee coming from Lebanon, Syria, Israel, France
and the United States could point out who violated the truce
accord which prohibits attacks on civilians.
</P>
<P>
Twelve Israeli soldiers were killed, four others wounded, and
one missing when Lebanese army and resistance fighters ambushed a
16-member Israeli commando Friday who landed on the village of
Nsariyyeh, about 45 kilometers north of the Israeli border in
attempt to explode a Shiite movement Amal base near the village.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Calls for African Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLANTYRE, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
today called on African countries to give their first priority to
the continent's economic integration.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the summit of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) which opened here today, Salim said, "SADC is
one of the five pillars upon which our African economic community
stands. We are, therefore, gathered under one of the great
pillars for regional cooperation and integration in Africa."
</P>
<P>
He believed that through building capacities for regional and
continental economic integration, Africa will be able to reverse
the current trend of operating on the periphery, and thus moving
the continent to the center stage of the global economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief urged all African governments and people to
accord priority to the issues of economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
He also called for creating an environment to promote and
facilitate the participation of the private sector in economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
The African Economic Community shall be established mainly
through coordination, harmonization and the progressive
integration of the programs of the regional economic communities,
Salim said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the serious human and material constraints facing
all the African Regional Economic Communities (RECS), Salim
called for avoidance of duplication.
</P>
<P>
"Our prime objective should be to ensure that all RECS
programs are going in the same direction of facilitating eventual
continental integration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim noted particularly that Africa's development efforts
have continued to be seriously undermined by the prevalence of
conflicts in some regions of the continent.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he accused the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) of not complying with the Lusaka
Peace Agreement signed in 1994, saying that it constitutes a
destabilizing force in that region of Angola.
</P>
<P>
"Conflicts are threatening to destroy the social fabric of our
society, with significant impact on the socio-economic
development of our countries and our region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief urged African countries to continue to
coordinate their efforts to address issues of peace, security,
and stability in Africa.

Kong, the same demands are made for teachers everywhere, such as
to be well-qualified and to set a good example for students, Qiu
added.

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Environment ministers from
central and East European countries held an informal talk with
their counterparts from the European Union (EU) today to discuss
pre-accession preparation on environment issues.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on the implementation of EU environmental
legislation in the central and East European countries, which is a
part of an environmental approximation program.
</P>
<P>
The countries that apply for EU membership will have to adopt
environment protection measures with precise timetables and
establish a comprehensive mechanism for monitoring progress.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive legislative guide, the first of its kind ever
produced by the EU's executive body European Commission and
distributed among discussion participants, represents a
step-by-step road map to implementation.
</P>
<P>
EU Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard described the
talk, the third since the inauguration of the program, as showing
"the way ahead on the road to membership for all 10 associated
countries."
</P>
<P>
Participants believe these informal consultations have proven
to be a very practical formula for constructive discussions
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission's Agenda 2000 suggests that such
informal talks should replace the existing structural dialogue as
the forum for general discussions on accession-related issues in
all policy areas.
</P>
<P>
The 10 applicant countries include Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,
Slovakia and Slovenia.

<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials today call
on their countrymen to do more to wipe out illiteracy and make a
significant contribution to the international learn-to-read
campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Wiping out illiteracy in a country with the largest population
in the world is of international significance," said Yu Zengfu,
secretary-general of the Chinese Committee of UNESCO, at a meeting
to mark the International Day on Wiping out Illiteracy, which is
today.
</P>
<P>
He said China's work has aroused international attention and
the country is actively cooperating with UNESCO in this field.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Tianbao, vice-minister of the State Education Commission,
said that some 24.4 million Chinese between the ages of 15 and 47
have learned to read and write over the past five years, bringing
the illiteracy rate down from 10.4 percent to 6.1 percent in this
age group.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the work has benefited China's economic
development and human rights course.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still a large illiterate population, most of
them are women living in the countryside, he added. Therefore,
governments at different levels must work still harder to bring
the illiteracy rate further down to two percent in the 15-47 age
group in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Kaixun, minister in charge of the State Education
Commission, presented awards to those people and units that have

<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to develop
friendly cooperative ties with eastern Caribbean nations in line
with the five principles of peaceful co-existence, Chinese Premier
Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with George Odlum, Minister of Foreign
Affairs and International Trade of Saint Lucia, Li extended a warm
welcome to his guest and said he believed Odlum's current visit
would help promote the deepening of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Odlum's visit, which has taken place soon after the
two countries established diplomatic ties, indicates that the
government of Saint Lucia attaches great importance to its
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
"Promotion of a friendly relationship of cooperation between
China and Saint Lucia, both developing nations, is in the
interests of the two peoples," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and
Saint Lucia is a major event in the history of bilateral ties," he
said. "This has laid a foundation for an overall development of
the relationship. China is ready to strengthen the relations of
mutual benefit and cooperation in various fields with Saint Lucia,
especially in the field of economic and trade cooperation and
exchanges."
</P>
<P>
Li said he appreciated the one-China policy of the new
government of Saint Lucia.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Chinese government has always adopted
an independent foreign policy for peace and held that all
countries, no matter they are big or small, rich or poor,
strong or weak, should be on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Odlum said he was honored to meet Li and
passed on regards from Saint Lucia Prime Minister Kenny Anthony to
Li, who in return asked Odlum to convey his best wishes to
Anthony.
</P>
<P>
The decision by his new government to set up diplomatic ties
with China is an important one based on political principles,
Odlum said, adding it is also a major event in the history of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Saint Lucia respects China's sovereignty and
sticks to the one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
He said his government spoke highly of China's foreign policy,
adding that China, as a big country, treats a small country like
Saint Lucia in a broadminded way.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate it very much," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the friendship between China and Saint Lucia is
sincere.
</P>
<P>
After the two countries established diplomatic ties, their
bilateral relations have become stronger, and the ties between
China and other eastern Caribbean states have also been promoted,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Present at today's meeting were Liu Huaqiu, director of the
Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council, and Li Zhaoxing,

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Army Moves Into Port, Ready to Fight: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A heavily armed contingent
of the Sierra Leone army backed by anti-aircraft guns, moved into
the country's main port in the east of the capital today to ward
off any air attack on ships now berth in the harbor, a government
statement said.
</P>
<P>
We are prepared to defend the port and its vital installation
and if this means war with the Nigerians, so be it, declared
Gaptain Abubakarr Kamara who is coordinating the operation.
</P>
<P>
The build-up of security is a follow-up of a magnetic rocket
and cluster bombs attack by a Nigerian Air force jet on Saturday
and Sunday on a merchant ship berth at the ports discharging
19,000 tons of rice from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The attacks wounded three para-military personnel guarding the
ship, damaged the General Manager's Office and over 15 imported
cars from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
"I can say the damage caused can be put at over 3 million U.
S. Dollars," said General Manager, Captain Patrick Kemokai.
</P>
<P>
Residents near the ports said they saw the jet took off from
the Lungi International Airport, currently occupied by a
contingent or the Nigerian army and headed toward the direction
of the port, about five miles away.
</P>
<P>
"We heard deafening sounds as the bombs were dropped and then
the jet flew back to Lungi," one eye witness said.
</P>
<P>
State radio described the act as "a provocation and violation
of the call by West African leaders at their recent summit at
Abuja for a peaceful resolution of the political impasse in
Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
The ground Commander of Ecomog forces in Sierra Leone, colonel
Max Khobe told Xinhua in a telephone interview that they have "a
mandate from ECOWAS to enforce a blockade and sanctions against
Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said they are worried over the increasing
tension building up between both sides which can trigger off a
large scale war if it is not checked.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has so far not okayed ECOWAS
decision to impose sanctions on Sierra Leone, observers here
said.

In the past year, bilateral relations have experienced positive
changes, and more areas of common interest are appearing, Li said.

"Bilateral trade ties are being conducted on a long-term and
steady basis," he said.

<P>
"The two countries are important trade partners to each other
and the two-way investment is continuing to increase. The two
countries compensate for each other's economic deficiency and
there are broad prospects for cooperation of mutual interest," the
premier stressed.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries have different social systems,
ideology and levels of development, they both belong to the Asia-
Pacific region, and are member states of the Asia Pacific Economic

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Provincial Governor Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Governor Rhee In-je of South
Korea's Kyonggi Province, who is very popular in polls, resigned
from his post today without mentioning whether or not he would
join the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to step down from my gubernatorial post," Rhee told
a news conference. He said the times and the people crave change.
</P>
<P>
Rhee did not elaborate on his future plans. He did say,
however, that he would try to blossom in "big politics" as he had
promised.
</P>
<P>
An aide to Rhee said he would decide on whether to run the
presidential election as an independent candidate after Chusok
(Mid-Autumn Festival) which falls on September 15.
</P>
<P>
Rhee, an aide to President Kim Young-sam, became governor of
the populous province encompassing Seoul in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by his popularity, Rhee is expected to eventually
join the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the race is a four-way competition between Lee
Hoi-chang from the ruling party, Kim Dae-jung, Kim Jong-pil and
Seoul Mayor Cho Soon from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Rhee's resignation came at a time when Lee Hoi-chang, who is in
third-place in the popularity polls, is under fire over his sons'
alleged evasion of military service.
</P>
<P>
Lee's opponents, which include some Rhee supporters, are
demanding his replacement in an apparent move to promote Rhee as
an alternative candidate.
</P>
<P>
But some critics and ruling party officials say it is far from
certain whether Rhee would be able to retain his popular public
image after joining the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that since only a few lawmakers among Lee's
opponents would support Rhee's presidential bid, Rhee is likely to
join hands with Lee in a party power-sharing deal.

<TEXT>
<P>
BLANTYRE, Malawi, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President
Bakili Muluzi, host for the on-going Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Summit, today hailed the Angolan peace
negotiation as a "victory".
</P>
<P>
Opening the SADC summit here this morning, Muluzi said with
the assistance of the international community, the U.N. and SADC
leaders, Angola has succeeded in bringing Jonas Savimbi, leader
of the former rebel movement National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
"Sincere appreciation and gratitude" should be given to
Zambian President Fredrick Chiluba for the role he played in
leading the negotiation process, Muluzi said.
</P>
<P>
The Malawian head of state fully believed that members of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) could work together
toward unleashing the creative potential of the people in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The most significant factor for SADC is that apart from a few
isolated incidents, the region enjoys peace, he noted, adding
that peace, democracy and respect for human rights would continue
to deepen throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
Political reforms such as constitutional and electoral
systems, which ensure transparency and predictability of the
systems in the region are still continuing, according to Muluzi.
</P>
<P>
Without political stability, there can be no significant
social or economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has sent its Minister of Construction
P. De Castro Vandunen to attend the SADC summit, representing
President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
The sudden change of Angolan leader for the SADC summit was
made Sunday morning, said Diana Nkhulembe, SADC liaison officer
yesterday, adding that the reason for the change was not
available.
</P>
<P>
Angola, which has suffered a civil war for nearly two decades,
have been receiving help from the southern African group for a
final peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi said that SADC members need to redouble their efforts
to take full advantage of the resources and capitalize the trade
and investment opportunities in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Malawian president also urged his countrymen and regional
neighbors to improve the productivity of their manufacturing
industries, without which no trade could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
He also called on SADC members to tackle the issues of
education and training together to equip the region for the 21st
century and beyond.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Army Put on Alert Against Islamic Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian army has been put
on maximum alert by President Liamine Zeroual to "take exceptional
measures" against Islamic militants, the Arabic daily Al Hayat
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reported decision by Zeroual came after Islamic militants
massacred 300 villagers on August 28, and 80 others on September 5
near the capital city Algiers. The militants were also held
responsible for a bombing attack last week in Algiers that killed
at least three.
</P>
<P>
Al Hayat, which is sold in several European capitals, quoted an
unidentified high-ranking official in Algeria as saying that the
130,000-strong National People's Army (ANP) of Algeria is now on
maximum alert, and is on the front line of the war against the
insurgency by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
It said that some personalities "in and outside the power" are
beginning to exert pressure on Zeroual to take exceptional
measures, including extending the power of the army in fighting
Islamic militants and imposing a curfew in the "flash spot"
regions that are haunted by terror.
</P>
<P>
According to Agence France-Presse, civilians in some parts of
Algiers region are organizing armed self-defense militiamen to
patrol the outskirts of their residential areas.
</P>
<P>
The ANP is headed by General Mohamed Lamari, the number two of
the Algerian authority, who reportedly advocates a ruthless war on
Islamic militants and opposes any compromise.
</P>
<P>
Algerians have been living under a state of emergency since
1992, when Islamic militants staged an insurgency after the army
canceled an election victory by the outlawed Islamic Salvation
Front.

resources is crucial to the final integration on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the SADC summit here this morning,
Mandela said, gender, productivity and respect for human rights
as well as the basic tenets of good governance, through which
human resources are expected to be fully tapped, are critical to
the socio-economic advancement of the people in te region.
</P>
<P>
The task of transforming SADC into a "dynamic development
community is urgent", Mandela, who doubles as Chairman of
Southern African Development Community (SADC), said.
</P>
<P>
SADC will give "unequivocal recognition that gender equality
is a fundamental human right to be realized through equatable
representation of women and men in decision-making structures as
well as equal access to resources, the chairman noted.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable progress has been made in engaging key
stake-holders such as private sector and civic associations in
the development of the sectoral protocols that will guide
regional integration, he said.
</P>
<P>
Productivity and competitiveness are regarded by the SADC
chairman as "indispensable weapons" in the war against poverty,
deprivation and marginalization.
</P>
<P>
Mandela urged the southern African organization to raise a
collective voice of concern where necessary.
</P>
<P>
The basis of good governance on the inter-state level of SADC,
Mandela said, is the basic principles of respecting for the
sovereignty of member states and non-interference in one
another's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mandela called on all SADC member states to abide by the
principles, values and ideals, which have been the the foundation
for the making of the regional group.
</P>
<P>
The SADC head said that they are striving for the creation of
a society in which all stakeholders -- labor, business and other
elements of civil society - can play a meaningful role for the
betterment of all.
</P>
<P>
The right of citizens to participate unhindered in political
activities in their countries is a "non-negotiable basic
principle," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
The creation of structures within which public opinion can be
mobilized and given expression is an undeniable part of the
democratic process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela urged SADC members to free their people, especially
children, from the savage threat of millions of explosive weapons
recklessly scattered across the region.

<HEADLINE> Facility Overinvestment Blamed for Industrial Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Overinvestment in facility
expansion by major South Korean industries, including automobiles,
shipbuilding, petrochemistry and semiconductors, have worsened the
profitability of domestic businesses, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
The excess capacity rate of the industries, which remains above
the 20-percent level, has seriously hurt profit, the Korea
Institute of Finance said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of current profits against industry's total facility
investments, a barometer of the profitability of industrial
output, stood at 6 percent in the 1990-1995 period, half of the 12
percent recorded by the Japanese industry during the same period,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The institute said profitability had worsened since last year
and would continue to decline, compared with big profits gained by
local semiconductor producers during the boom years of 1994 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
It said excessive investments by local companies in heavy and
chemical industries has resulted in a buildup of excess capacity
as well as a drop in profitability.
</P>
<P>
The institute warned that overcapacity would become even more
serious in the coming years, considering the number of massive
investment projects planned and those already underway, such as
Samsung Motors Inc.'s entry into the automobile industry.
</P>
<P>
"Companies need to focus on developing new technologies and
enhancing efficiency by specializing in specific sectors, rather
than diversifying into various lines, to help solve the
overcapacity problems," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also said "the government for its part should encourage
businesses toward this direction."

<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Overseas enterprises run by
south China's Guangdong Province in south China are engaging in
competition on the world market and in turn contributing greatly
to the province's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The province has established 862 firms in 48 countries and
regions, some 50 percent of which are in Hong Kong. These
enterprises recorded a business volume of over 70 billion yuan
last year in ventures in the trade, industrial, finance,
labor and consulting services sectors.
</P>
<P>
Participation in international competition has greatly promoted
the performance and efficiency of local enterprises. The Hong Kong
Branch of the Glee Group, after considering the needs of the
European market, has decided to introduce a production line
of mobile air-conditioners.
</P>
<P>
Five Guangdong businesses are currently listed on the Hong Kong
stock exchange. The Yuehai Group, formed with an investment of two
million US dollars, had total assets of 21.7 billion Hong Kong
dollars by the end of 1995, with its assets growing by an average
73 percent annually.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nigeria May Adopt Phased Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria may adopt a three-phased
privatization program, as it is the recommendation by the Vision 2010
Committee, the country's first and foremost long-term planning body.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Daily Champion newspaper, the privatization
program will run for over 12 years starting from next year.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase that ends at the year 2000, public enterprises
such as the National Electric Power Authority, Nigerian
Telecommunications, the downstream operations of the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation and urban water utilities will revert to private
ownership and control.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the committee want these firms privatized first because
of their size and their socio-economic impact as well as hopes of
spinning off immediate growth of the economy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The second phase will run from 2001 to 2005, during which
infrastructure and other public enterprises not operating efficiently
or had never commenced operations, but which require substantial
capital injection will be sold off.
</P>
<P>
The report gave the example the Ajaokuta Steel Complex, which has
cost the country five billion U.S. dollars since its construction was
started a decade ago but has never been finished.
</P>
<P>
Other enterprises that may be privatized in this phase include the
Nigerian Railway Corporation, the Nigerian Coal Corporation, the Delta
steel plant and others, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The final phase will see those public enterprises with little
impact on the economy, unfinished and abandoned projects and all
others not yet affected by the exercise, being privatized.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's privatization practice began in late 1980s under the
supervision of the defunct Technical Committee on Privatization and
Commercialization now known as the Bureau of Public Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In its final report released in 1993, the committee said
government, by that date, had partial or whole equity ownership of
about 574 enterprises, of which about 145 had been privatized or
commercialization.
</P>
<P>
The program was expected to have been restarted at the beginning of
this year, but the government later put it off, claiming that there
was a need to further study the issue.
</P>
<P>
As the Vision 2010 Committee is to submit its final report later
this month, the head of state, General Sani Abacha, may however be
sold the idea, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the committee and former head of the interim
government before Abacha, Chief E.A.O. Shonekan, in a recent interview
with Xinhua, stressed the need to encourage competition in the
economy.

TEHRAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-General of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) Izzidine Al-Iraki met
with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi here today to
discuss ways of holding the 8th OIC summit here in December.
</P>
<P>
"Tehran summit will be a turning point in the ties among
the Islamic countries, and considering the Islamic countries' keen
interest in attending the meeting in Tehran, it is hoped
that this summit will be able to resolve the problems of the
Islamic world," Iraki was quoted by the state-run Tehran Radio
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraki, who arrived here yesterday, expressed the willingness of
his office to cooperate with Iran during Iran's chairmanship of
the OIC which begins this December.
</P>
<P>
Morocco is presently chairing the OIC which was founded in May
1971 and has a total 42 member states.
</P>
<P>
"During Iran's chairmanship of OIC, the Secretariat and all
the people running this organization will have serious cooperation
and coordination with the Islamic Republic of Iran," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi urged OIC to take a more active part in solving
the problems of the Muslims which, he said, constituted some
25 percent of the world population.
</P>
<P>
"In the post-cold war world, which is no longer bipolar
and in which the regional and international organizations are
increasingly spending efforts to be present in world equations,
it is necessary for the OIC ... to play a more definitive
role in resolving world problems," he said.

<HEADLINE> Former Chief of Staff Returns to Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- General Issac Lumago, former
Chief of Staff of Uganda Army, has returned after his 20 years of
exile, ''the New Vision'' paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
A three-member team including Grace Nyakwenegura, a private
secretary of Uganda President Yoweri Museveni, arranged the
general's return. They travelled to Kinshasa to pick up the
general and accompanied him in flying back last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lumago lived in Kinshasa for the last 18 years and did his
business there, leaving his family in Koboko in the northwest.
Kamanda Bataringaya, the Ugandan Ambassador in Congo or ex Zaire,
was also on the flight.
</P>
<P>
Lumago was one of about a thousand former officers fled the
country when former Uganda dictator Idi Amin was overthrown in
1979. But he did not involve in any activity of rebel groups
against President Yoweri Museveni, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni is expected to meet the general, said the
report.
</P>

are still haunted by the rebels of Uganda National Rescue Front,
part two (UNRF ii). Some 130 rebels of UNRF ii rebels have been
charged with treason recently. This rebel group recruited a
hundred of youths for military training to fill their ranks, a
recent report said.

<P>
KUNMING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government's
International Cooperation Agency has announced plans
to cooperate with Chinese experts from Yunnan Province in
preparing a feasibility study for the construction of a new
hydropower station on the Jinsha River.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from the agency recently visited the proposed site
for the Jin'anqiao Hydropower Station on the Jinsha River in the
upper reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Niu Shaoyao, deputy governor of Yunnan
Province, the head of the Japanese delegation expressed hope that
the cooperation agreement will be finalized in the near future. He
noted that the agency will provide technical support and join in
research related to the project.
</P>
<P>
The Jinsha River meanders some 3,496 km through Yunnan and is
the longest river in the province in southwest China . The Jinsha
River, which drops some 5,000 meters in elevation, represents
rich hydropower resources. Estimates indicate that the river
offers an easily exploitable generating capacity of 80 million kw,
making it China's largest untapped hydropower energy base.
</P>
<P>
Jin'anqiao is located in Lijiang county in the middle reaches
of the Jinsha River. A team from the Kunming Survey and Design
Institute under the Ministry of Power Industry began surveying the
proposed dam site in 1993 and has completed a preliminary
feasibility study.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the installation of generators with a combined
generating capacity of three million kw. The projected cost of the
dam has been set at 12.08 billion yuan (1.47 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Highways, telecommunications and power supply facilities are
already in place for the construction of the project, according to
local officials.

integration as the top agenda.
</P>
<P>
Bakili Muluzi, President of the Republic of Malawi, said at the
opening ceremony that the group is aimed at "true and meaningful
integration to the benefit of the people in the region."
</P>
<P>
High on the development agenda at the summit will be
gender, energy, productivity, health, environment, natural

</P>
<P>
The challenges SADC faces are to eradicate poverty and promote
development, he said, adding that institutional mechanisms are in
place to guarantee the future prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The SADC members need to consolidate the already achieved
democracy and good governance for free enterprise, human
resources development and harmonious labor management relations,
Muluzi said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Shrimp Export To Earn 1.25 Bln Dollars in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The shrimp sector of Bangladesh
can earn 55 billion taka (about 1.25 billion U.S. dollars)
annually by exporting 90,000 tons of shrimps by the year 2002,
shrimp industry officials said today.
</P>
<P>
This target can be reached by the introduction of intensive
cultivation which could raise the per hectare yield to 300
kilograms from 250 kilograms under traditional system of
cultivation, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
At present, Bangladesh exports 34,000 tons of shrimps annually,
 Gulam Mustafa, president of Bangladesh Frozen Food Exporters'
Association (BFFEA), was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The shrimp export industry started in early seventies, and at
the beginning earned about 630,000 dollars annually, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has attained tremendous success in exporting
cultivated shrimps on the world market in recent years, with
export increasing 28 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is now the 7th largest shrimp exporter in the world,
its income from shrimp export accounts for 10 percent of the total
export income and contributes 4.7 percent of its gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh earned 12.83 billion taka (about 290 million
dollars) from shrimp export in the 1995-96 fiscal year and is
expected to generate 13.66 billion taka (about 310 million
dollars) in fiscal 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
According to the BFFEA, the Bangladeshi Government has agreed
to give a special credit of 4 million taka (about 91,000 dollars)
for each shrimp-processing plant.
</P>
<P>
The major importers of Bangladesh shrimps are 15 European
countries, the U.S. and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Aircraft Engine Overhaul Center Opened in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- An engine overhaul center
was opened here today to repair jumbo jets' engines for airlines
across the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Aero Engine Services Limited (HAESL), a 50-50
joint venture between Rolls-Royce and Hong Kong Aircraft
Engineering Company (HAECO), poured in 120 million U.S. dollars to
build the overhaul center at Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate in
the northeast of the "New Territories."
</P>
<P>
The center can provide repair and overhaul services for
aircraft engines, ranging from the RB211 on the Boeing 757 to the
Trent 800 on the Boeing 777 and the V2500 engines on the Airbus
A320 and Boeing MD-90.
</P>
<P>
Inside the overhaul center is the largest engine test cell in
Asia, which is capable of testing the world's most powerful
engine, the Trent 800, which has been chosen to power all Boeing
777 jets ordered so far by Southeast Asian airlines.
</P>
<P>
Set up in June 1996, HAESL now shares HAECO's headquarters and
facilities at Kai Tak Airport. The company incorporated the engine
overhaul operations of its parent HAECO, which has 22-year
experience of maintaining Rolls-Royce engines.
</P>
<P>
The company will transfer all its facilities from Kai Tak to
Tseung Kwan O by April 1998, when the airport is scheduled to
close. The new overhaul center is expected to repair some 300
engines a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Organization (WHO) has appealed to the United States to prevent
American companies from exporting tobacco to developing
countries, local daily Sowetan reported today.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 49 African states made the appeal in a

<P>
They unanimously agreed to urge the WHO secretariat to support
African countries to put in place effective tobacco control

<HEADLINE> PNA Security Forces Nab 35 Militant Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian security forces
arrested 35 Islamic militants overnight in a West Bank crackdown
on terrorism following the recent series of suicide bombings in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported today that Palestinian security forces
conducted house-to-house searches in West Bank towns Sunday night
to arrest activists associated with the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) and the Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
They were trying to find clues linking to the recent two
suicide bombing attacks in central Jerusalem in which 20 Israelis
and five suicide bombers were killed.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has claimed responsibility for both the July 30 twin
bombings in the Mahane Yehuda market, which killed 17 people and
wounded 170 others, and last Thursday's triple bombings in the Ben
Yehuda pedestrian mall, which claimed eight lives so far and
wounded 190 others.
</P>
<P>
The arrests came two days ahead of the much-awaited first
visit to the region by United States Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Wednesday, who has urged Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat to launch a war on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israel has frozen the execution of the Oslo accords in a bid to
pressure Arafat to take "genuine steps" to fight Hamas and other
anti-Israeli militant organizations. Israeli government has
demanded Albright focus her attention on the PNA's fight on
terrorism during her visit here.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the PNA hopes Albright to persuade Israel to lift
the tough sanctions taken following the Ben Yehuda bombings,
including a total closure, the internal travel ban on West Bank
residents and the freeze on further troop redeployments.
</P>
<P>
The PNA actions against Islamic militants were regarded as a
gesture to the Americans ahead of Albright's trip to show that it
is making real efforts to crack down on terrorists.
</P>
<P>
But in a press conference held in Jerusalem this morning, PNA
Minister for Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini denied the latest
arrests were connected to Albright's coming visit.
</P>
<P>
He added that the PNA has high expectations for Albright's
visit, and hopes the U.S. would adopt an even-handed policy in
making efforts to get the peace process back on track.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has witnessed an economic upsurge in recent years as a
result of expanded opening and the rise of booming export-oriented
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of the total overseas investment used in the
province since its opening to the outside in 1978 came in
the past five years. Much of the investments have been
earmarked for the transformation of outmoded state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The province has also recorded double-digit foreign trade
growth over the past five years, with last year's total volume
topping 15 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The coastal city of Dalian, which leads in the local opening
efforts, has notched further progress in the construction of
development and free trade zones. More than 20 international
financial organizations have opened offices in Dalian and have
helped the city to emerge as one of northern China's major trade,
commercial and financial center.
</P>
<P>
Booming export-oriented economic development in Shenyang, the
provincial capital, and Jinzhou have played an important role in
accelerating the province's comprehensive economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In addition to focusing on infrastructure construction, the
province has also emphasized improvements in the local investment
environment and introduced improved legal and professional
training systems..

<HEADLINE> Jordan Minister Terms Tripartite Summit As Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian official
today termed the summit held here Sunday among Egyptian, Jordanian
and Palestinian leaders as important to coordinate Arab stances.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs
Radio, Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister for Services and
Administrative Development Abdullah Ensour said the meeting was a
"sound step" by the Arab leaders to coordinate their stances on the
current developments.
</P>
<P>
The summit among Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, King Hussein
of Jordan and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was held to prepare
for the upcoming tour of the Mideast by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, said the minister, who attended the summit.
</P>
<P>
"Their response to Albright's views and initiatives will be
coordinated and orchestrated," he said, adding that "this
unanimity in views" was the target of Sunday's summit.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the three leaders called on the U.S. to redouble
its effort to save peace and urged parties concerned to
"accurately and honestly" implement all signed accords, according
to the statement issued at the end of the nearly three-hour
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Albright is reportedly to be on a week-long trip to Israel,
Palestinian areas, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia starting
Wednesday in a bid to revive the stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace
negotiations which came to a halt since Israel began construction
of a controversial Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in
March.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries that have
diplomatic ties with Israel and played important roles in past
mediation in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The military administrator of
Kano State in north Nigeria, Colonel Dominic Oneya said recently
that he supports General Sani Abacha's presidency.
</P>
<P>
Oneya thus became the second man of the 30 administrators that
have declared his support to the head of state's candidacy if he
choose to contest in next year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Mohammed Marwa, the administrator of Lagos State in
the southwest expressed the same position a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a forum sponsored by the official New Nigerian
newspaper, Colonel Oneya said General Abacha is free to aspire to
the presidency of the nation through a free and fair election.
</P>
<P>
"If he desires to contest any elective office, I will give him
my support being a citizen of Kano," he said.
</P>
<P>
Oneya, however, accused those canvassing for Abacha's
presidency of having their own program.
</P>
<P>
As the military head of state he ushered in the current
transition to civil rule program, Abacha's qualification as a
presidency candidate have been questioned by some people both in
and outside Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
A recent research done by scholars from a group of Nigerian
universities, however, claimed that 72 percent of Nigerians
support Abacha's presidency.

<TEXT>
<P>
BLANTYRE, Malawi, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) started their
summit here in the southern Malawi city this morning, putting
integration as the top agenda.
</P>
<P>
Bakili Muluzi, President of the Republic of Malawi, said at the
opening ceremony that the group is aimed at "true and meaningful
integration to the benefit of the people in the region."
</P>
<P>
High on the development agenda at the summit will be put on
gender, energy, productivity, health, environment, natural
resources management, human resources development, good
governance and popular participation, said Muluzi.
</P>
<P>
The challenges SADC faces are to eradicate poverty and promote
development, he said, adding that institutional mechanisms are in
place to guarantee the future prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The SADC members need to consolidate the already achieved
democracy and good governance for free enterprise, human
resources development and harmonious labor management relations,
Muluzi said.
</P>
<P>
Particular attention to the development of small and medium
scale enterprises, the informal sector and the small-holder
agriculture sector, as these sectors offer real prospects for
gains in productivity, the Malawian leader said.
</P>
<P>
Food security in the region, where food production has
declined for the serious drought and migratory pests, is yet
another challenge, he said.
</P>
<P>
More emphasis is stressed by the Malawian leader on policies
and programs that will enable the region to achieve food
self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
Peace and stability, democracy and respect for human rights,
which continue to deepen in the region, is of crucial importance,
without which no significant social or economic development can
be achieved, Muluzi said.
</P>
<P>
Ten heads of state of the 12 SADC members, except Angola which
sent its minister of construction De Castro Vandunen, and Lesotho
representing by its deputy Prime Minister Pakalltha B. Mosisili,

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Concerned About Mideast Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has expressed concern over the deteriorating situation in
the Middle East, a statement issued by the U.N. office said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The statement on U.N. activities in hotbeds of conflict came
four days after the triple suicide bombing in Jerusalem which
killed eight people and wounded nearly 200 others.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who deemed the Mideast to be among the most tense areas
in the world, voiced hope that the Palestinian-Israeli sides, the
focal point of Arab-Israeli conflict, would resume their peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been stalled since
March when Israel broke ground for a new Jewish settlement in
traditional Arab East Jerusalem, where the Palestinians want as
their future capital.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. chief also expressed deep concern over the current
Lebanese-Israeli conflicts in south Lebanon and of the conflicts
between Iraq and Kuwait," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in the region escalated after 11 Israeli commandos
were killed last Friday in a fierce clash with Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas and the Lebanese army in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observers Mission (UNIKOM) was working to
achieve security and stability on the borders between the two
countries, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and later was driven out by
U.S.-led multi-national forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan spoke of the U.N.'s contributions to bolster
security and stability in the region and cited as an example the
humanitarian aid dispensed by the United Nations Works and Relief
Agency (UNWRA).

<HEADLINE> Taliban Gain Territory in Northern Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Forces loyal to the Afghan
Taliban militia have expanded their enclave of territory in
northern Afghanistan and edged closer to the stronghold of their
rival alliance, Taliban sources said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban fighters have taken the town of Tashqurghan, about 40
km east of Mazar-e-Sharif, capital of Afghanistan's northwestern
Balkh province, with the help of some defected local commanders,
the Taliban sources here said.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been no reports of casualties and no exact
information on how much ground has been lost by the anti-Taliban
alliance, based in Mazar-e-Sharif and led mainly by Uzbek warlord
Abdul Malik and Tajik warlord Ahmad Masood.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to launch counter-attacks, Malik has already cut
the main road between Mazar-e-Sharif and areas north of Kabul and
rushed more forces to the front, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been raging for many days near the border of
Malik-controlled provinces of Balkh and Samangan as well as Kunduz
province which has been held by a Taliban expeditionary force
since late May.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban forces under Masood's command have been also
battling the Islamic militia north of Kabul. Despite sporadic
battles and frequent bombing raids, the front lines between the
two sides have remained deadlocked around 25 km north of Kabul for
more than two months.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who control the Afghan capital of Kabul and
two-thirds of Afghanistan's territory, have vowed to impose a
strict Islamic law in the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> Manila Denies Financial Problems in Banking System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Philippine banking
official today strongly denied reports that some big banks are
experiencing financial problems as a result of the current turmoil
in the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Singson, governor of the Philippine Central Bank, said
in a statement that he will seek the help of the National Bureau
of Investigation (NBI) to find out the veracity of these reports.
</P>
<P>
He said necessary action will be taken against those who are
responsible for spreading such rumors that the banking system is
indeed in trouble.
</P>
<P>
These stories are absolutely baseless and irresponsible
considering that the banking industry at the moment is in fact in
robust health, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the central bank is currently monitoring the
performance of individual banks, particularly the commercial
banks, so that there is no reason to be alarmed by these rumors.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that bank capitals are adequate to meet
international business standard, adding that the banking industry
has been raking in huge profits.
</P>
<P>
He assured the public, particularly the millions of depositors,
not to be alarmed by the rumors which were spread by people whose
motives could result in panic withdrawals thus adding misery to
the currency crisis which the financial market is experiencing at
the moment.
</P>
<P>
Singson added that the central bank is always on standby and
ready to come to the rescue of banks which need assistance as
allowed by law in the event the situation gets out of control.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Calls for Struggling Against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
here today called on various countries in the world to struggle
against poverty.
</P>
<P>
Opening the regional conference on comparative experience in
poverty eradication at the State Palace, the president said
poverty eradication is the great challenge of man and mankind at
the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Poverty is a major problem of developing countries in many
parts of the world, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto quoted the United Nations report as saying that today
there are more than 1.3 billion poor people on the face of our
planet. The ranks of these poor people continue to become larger
by around 25 million every year.
</P>
<P>
"Our hearts become growingly painful, because this figure shows
that the number of our poor fellow human beings increases by 47
persons every minute," he said.
</P>
<P>
On economy and poverty eradication in Indonesia, Soeharto said
after long years of hard work, Indonesia succeeded in drastically
reducing the number of poor people.
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Indonesia's poor population was 70 million persons, or
60 percent of the total population. In 1996, the number declined
to around 20 million or 11 percent of the population. During that
period of 26 years, Indonesia's population rose by 84 million,
from 116 million in 1970 to 200 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto pointed out that development is a process of
large-scale changes. They must be aimed at the improvement and
advancement of people's life. That should be planned with a clear
vision to ensure that dynamic forces of the nation become the
motor of development.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he said, national development necessitates a solid
and dynamic national stability in all aspects of life. Such
stability shall induce an adequate economic growth and this, in
turn, shall materialize equitable distribution of development
which is imbued with social justice and this is conducive to the
improvement of the people's well-being and enhancement of human
dignity.
</P>
<P>
"Unless there is growth, there will never be an improved
prosperity. The absence of an equitable distribution may become
the seed of social unrest that will lead to social upheaval and
disintegration," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting is attended by representatives from 15
countries, including China.
</P>
<P>
Before the opening of the meeting, President Soeharto received
a special citation presented personally by the administrator of
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) for Indonesia's
success in reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a president receives a UNDP award,
official sources said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Enforce Anti-dumping Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan government is
considering the enforcement of an anti-dumping law to protect the
country's national industries, sources close to the Commerce
Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The anti-dumping law, which has already been drafted by the
National Tariff Commission, is likely to be enforced along with
the forthcoming industrial policy as part of the continuous
process of economic reforms initiated by the government led by
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It is deemed necessary for Pakistan to enforce such a law to
protect the local industry when the country's products are being
hit hard by anti-dumping laws in Japan and European countries,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Through various means, and especially smuggling, goods are
being dumped in Pakistan in relatively cheaper prices creating
unfair competition for the local industry, they said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, which is awaiting adoption by the
parliament, punitive duties have been proposed for dumping and
subsidization of goods from other countries, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
These punitive duties could remain enforced for a minimum
period of five years and, in some cases if necessary, this period
can be extended, they said.

MOSCOW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The main computer system on
Russia's Mir space station broke down, resulting in a shutdown of
all systems except life-support functions, a Russian space official
said today.
</P>
<P>
The computer shut itself off for unknown reasons, said Valery
Lyndin, spokesman for Russia's Mission Control.
</P>
<P>
"The computer has become capricious again," and the time when
it happened was not clear, he added.
</P>
<P>
The crew on board, two Russian cosmonauts and one American
astronaut, were not in any immediate danger, the Associated Press
quoted Lyndin as saying.
</P>
<P>
The computer system had failed twice in recent months, which
took the crew "several days to fully restore all functions," the

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manufacturing Output Up 7.7 Pct in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output increased 7.7 percent in July with higher output of
chemical products and continued recovery in the electronics
industry, the Economic Development Board (EDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 1997, the cumulative output of the
manufacturing sector has turned positive, recording a marginal
increase of 0.2 percent over the same period of last year, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals industries, including petroleum, petrochemicals,
pharmaceuticals and industries/specialty chemicals, continued to
expand, as the July increase of 34.4 percent brought the
cumulative output growth of the first seven months of 1997 to 13.2
percent, the EDB said.
</P>
<P>
The output of the electronics industry was sustained by the
continued export demand, the EDB said, noting that July saw an
increase of 9.1 percent in output arising from higher output of
disk drives, computer peripherals, semiconductors and
telecommunication equipment.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative output for the first seven months of 1997 was
now 1.1 percent less than the same 1996 period, it said.
</P>
<P>
The electrical machinery industry grew 7.1 percent as output of
connectors, power cables and batteries increased to meet export
orders. The cumulative output for the first seven months of this
year was 0.5 percent lower than the corresponding period of last
year, the EDB said.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Currency Appreciates Against US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian currency called
"Liberty" has gained 33 percent against the U.S. Dollar in the
country's flourishing parallel money market since the election in
July, the Vanguard newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said, Liberty, which exchanged at an average of 45
for one Dollar before the July 19 election, rose to 30 for one
greenback by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Liberty was at par with the U.S. Dollar in circulation in
Liberia before it was changed in 1985 by late President Samuel
Doe.
</P>
<P>
Although the appreciation has yet to reflect the price of
goods and the shattered lives of average Liberians, economists
say the trend, if maintained, could put Liberia on the way to
economic recovery after the war.
</P>
<P>
A stronger parallel currency, the JJ Roberts Liberian Dollar,
used in the former strong hold of Charles Taylor's National
Patriotic Front-line, is also now at par with Liberty. The
exchange rate used to be three Liberty to one JJ before the
election.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said during his election campaign that he would restore
the U.S. Dollar as the legal tender in the country.

CANBERRA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar today
hovered around 73.00 U.S. cents as market players awaited jobs
figures due out on Thursday to provide further direction.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended at 72.98 U.S. cents, down from its
late Friday level of 73.24.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the Australian dollar spent the day between 72.92
and 73.09 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Players said they were watching for Thursday's Australian
Bureau of Statistics August labor force data release to determine
the chances of a cut to official interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Economist Glenn Maguire said that a strong employment outcome
should cement the view that monetary policy was on hold for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
"The risk to interest rate markets this week, however, is a
combination of weak housing and employment data, prompting the
market to again reassess the likely stance of monetary policy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar finished at 88.12
from 88.66 against the Japanese yen and at 1.3116 from 1.3202

COLOMBO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 people, including
seven civilians, were killed in northeastern Sri Lanka today as
government troops repulsed a massive Tamil guerrilla attack, a
military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A large group of Tamil rebels attacked the Kalyanapura village
in Welioya at around 1:30 a.m. Government troops guarding the
village fired back, causing heavy casualties of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman for the Defense Ministry put the death
toll at 14, including seven rebels and seven civilians in the
village.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of gunfire also caused four government soldiers
and five civilians injured.
</P>
<P>
Searching the battlefield, the troops recovered two light
machine guns, five T-56 weapons and other military items left
behind by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The renewed fighting came two days after the temporary truce
between the two sides collapsed in the east of the country on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamils Eelam (LTTE) has been fighting
for a separate state of their own for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
So far the bitter war has claimed more than 50,000 lives and
hindered economic development of this island nation.
</P>
<P>
Trying to bring an end to the war, the government has proposed
to solve the long-standing conflict through political ways, but
the Tamil rebels simply gave a definite "no" answer by staging one
after another attacks at government and military targets.

<HEADLINE> India Not Able to Buy Nuclear Plants: IAEA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Hans Blix said today that India would
not be able to buy nuclear plants as long as it remains outside
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen here after inaugurating the international
seminar on the role of nuclear energy for sustainable development
organized by the Department of Atomic Energy, Hans Blix said that
since most vendors of nuclear plants belong to nuclear suppliers
club, they are prohibited from selling nuclear technologies to
countries that do not accept IAEA fullscope safeguards.
</P>
<P>
India was able to go ahead with its nuclear deal with Russia
because the deal was struck before Russia was bound by the new
control regime, he further said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from finance, the single major hurdle for India to
develop its nuclear power program is its non-adherence to NPT, he
added.

<P>
SEOUL, September 8 (Xinhua) -- With the number of job seekers
exceeding that of the available jobs, South Korea will likely have
its worst year in employment this year since 1992, according to
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The number of the unemployed in July reached 14,587 while
vacant positions were only 13,785, according to the Ministry of
Finance and Economy (MOFE) and the Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
These figures were collected from 52 employment security
centers across the country.
</P>
<P>
This marks the first time that the number of job seekers has
surpassed the number of available jobs since 1992. The resulting
low rate of job availability for this year is an outcome of the
ongoing economic recession and the bankruptcies of major
conglomerates, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Vows to Push on Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto vowed today to push through his pledged reforms hours
after he was reelected president of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP).
</P>
<P>
"Reforms in six fields will accompany the very difficult
decision to conduct a thorough probe into our conventional systems
and vested interests," Hashimoto told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto has pledged to carry out reforms in administration,
fiscal policy, economic structure, social welfare, finance and
education.
</P>
<P>
Such reforms will require some initial sacrifices and a strong
and stable political foundation is therefore essential, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he will make efforts to further improve
relations with China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, 60, is the first LDP president in 13 years to get a
second two-year term since former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasono
in November 1984.
</P>
<P>
His reelection will be formally endorsed at a plenary session
of the LDP members in both houses of the Diet (parliament)
scheduled for Thursday. After that, he is expected to name key
party posts and reshuffle the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto was first elected LDP president in September 1995 in
an overwhelming victory over his sole rival, Junichiro Koizumi,
the current health and welfare minister.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto took the helm of a coalition government of the LDP,
Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Sakigake in January 1996 from
Tomiichi Murayama, head of the SDP, and launched his second
cabinet in last November.

<HEADLINE> CCP 15th Congress to Lay Good Foundation for Future: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Australian Prime
Minister Malcolm Fraser said today the upcoming 15th Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) Congress will lay a good foundation for
China's future social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
"I wish the Chinese people well and the congress a success,"
the former prime minister said in Melbourne today.
</P>
<P>
The party congress is scheduled to open Friday and is expected
to make strategic plans on the country's future development and
elect a party leadership leading China into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, China will
go forward "in its own way" to modernization and prosperity,
Fraser said in a telephone interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism about the future of the world's most
populous country and fastest economy in the world.
</P>
<P>
Fraser said his optimism was based upon China's experience
during the past 18 years' reform and opening to the outside world
under the leadership of the party.
</P>
<P>
Great achievements have been made in China's economic and
social development since the reform and opening policy was
initiated 18 years ago, said Fraser, who had been prime minister
during November of 1975 and March of 1983.
</P>
<P>
China's economy has been growing at an average of 10 percent
each year during the past 18 years.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the success to the particular road China chose
under the leadership of the party, which helped improve the
standard of living of hundreds of millions of people.
</P>
<P>
China's rapid development and stability is favorable to other
part of the world, and China's huge domestic market, particularly
the potential purchasing power of 1.2 billion consumers, provides
great opportunities for other countries, including Australia.
</P>
<P>
He hoped China will join the World Trade Organization "as soon
as possible".

<HEADLINE>   Ramos Denies Seeking to Scrap 1998 Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos, in a fresh move to ease public anxieties, today vehemently
rejected charges that he is seeking to scrap the 1998 general
election and proclaim martial law in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Ramos administration and I as president have been the
subject of a massive disinformation campaign on various issues
related to constitutional change," Ramos said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who maliciously claim that we are
planning no elections in May 1998, that we are seeking to proclaim
martial law, that we are veering toward dictatorship."
</P>
<P>
Slamming these claims as "blatant lies, falsehoods and
fabrications," Ramos said, "As president, I categorically and
emphatically deny these irresponsible accusations."
</P>
<P>
"I also categorically declare that our country will definitely
have national and local elections in May 1998 as scheduled," he
said, adding that he is against "term extension."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Ramos to formally dismiss
accusations that he is planning to seek a second term by imposing
martial law and other means.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' statement came two days after wide anxieties were
generated among the church, the opposition camp and the business
community by the president's remarks at an economic meeting last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Ramos surprised many by announcing that he must
"keep his options open" -- remarks which were widely interpreted
as a hint that Ramos was open for another term under a changed
charter.
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday, Ramos brushed aside such speculations by
saying his option is to choose his successor in his ruling party
for next year's polls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition accused the Ramos administration of
creating political instability by planting bombs in public places
to provide an excuse for imposing martial law.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, two separate bomb blasts in Manila killed six
people and wounded 60 others. A shadowy military group claimed
responsibility for the bombings, saying it supports a second term
for Ramos and threatening more offensives if opposition to Ramos'
re-election persists.
</P>
<P>
In today's statement, Ramos said he has "no intention
whatsoever to proclaim martial law" and will not direct the
military to "undertake any operations that may be misconstrued as
actions leading to martial law."
</P>
<P>
Ramos also stressed that his record stands against
dictatorship, citing his role in the 1986 people power revolution
which ended the dictatorial rule of former President Ferdinand
Marcos.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's 1987 constitution, Ramos must step down in
June 1998 when his single six-year term expires. But his
supporters have sought to revise the charter to lift term limits
for the president since last year.
</P>
<P>
The constitution, promulgated after the ouster of former
President Marcos, provides for only one single six-year term for
the president in order to prevent a repeat of dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has repeatedly voiced his determination to step down in
June 1998 when his six-year term expires. But he also expressed
strong support for the people's right to rewrite the constitution.

<HEADLINE> Israel Beefs up Security for More Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces
have been on high alert against new terror attacks before or
during U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit this
Wednesday, The Jerusalem Post newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Since last Thursday's triple suicide bombing in Jerusalem's
Ben Yehuda Street, which killed eight people (including the three
bombers) and wounded nearly 200 others, Israeli security forces
have arrested 169 Palestinians in the West Bank as suspects of the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials claimed that the July 30 Mahaneh Yehuda and
September 4 Ben Yehuda bombings were both carried out by Hamas
members from the West Bank or Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Following the Ben Yehuda attack, Israel reimposed a complete
closure on West Bank and Gaza Strip and demanded all Palestinian
workers inside Israel return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
In addition, restrictions on internal movements were ordered on
villages and towns under Palestinian control. Israelis were also
barred from entering these areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel meanwhile demanded Sunday that the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) extradite Palestinian police chief Ghazi Jabali
for questioning about his suspected involvement in "a conspiracy
to commit crime and attempted murder."
</P>
<P>
Israeli justice officials charged that Jabali was suspected of
involvement in a shooting in July at a Jewish settler's car which
caused no injury. But Jabali and the PNA have denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
On its part, the PNA links security ties with Israel to
further withdrawals of Israeli troops from West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Dahlan, chief of the PNA's Preventive Security
Apparatus in Gaza Strip, said he was prepared to cooperate with
Israel "on condition that it participates in the peace process.
This means the implementation of the interim agreements signed
until now."
</P>
<P>
Albright will arrive to begin her first Middle East trip
Wednesday in an effort to revive the deep-troubled peace process
and restore confidence between Israel and Palestinians.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Coca-cola company,
the world's leading soft drinks group, would today sign a joint
venture agreement with the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, a new bottling plant will be established and
the existing one will be upgraded, according to local media
reports.
</P>
<P>
The investment in the two plants, which would be managed by
South African Breweries, would total about 33 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The pact would be signed, at a meeting ending the three-day
U.S.-Angolan trade mission, by Angolan President Eduardo Dos
Santos and Coca-cola's African President Carl Ware.
</P>
<P>
Coca cola's African spokesman said the joint venture formed
part of his company's belief in Angola's future and that of its
people.
</P>
<P>
Coca-cola's move into Angola follows hard on the heels of
similar investment in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa and east
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Coca-cola and its bottling partners employ 100,000 people in
Africa now, of which 13,000 are in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Opposition-Sponsored Rally Flops in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A planned rally called by the
National Convention Executive Council (NCEC) in Kisumu, the
third-largest city of Kenya, flopped Sunday when nine Opposition
leaders were detained at Kisumu airport.
</P>
<P>
The much-publicized rally in the city ashore Lake Victoria
failed to take off as anti-riot police, patrolling the streets in
armored cars or on foot, ensured no gatherings were held or no
groups of people met to discuss the meeting, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Security was tight in the town and its outskirts since
Saturday evening. The meeting venue was guarded overnight with
squads of officers pitching tents there so that nobody could
enter.
</P>
<P>
Among the Opposition leaders having been held at the airport
for six hours were FORD-Kenya First National Vice-Chairman James
Orengo, NCEC leader Kivutha Kibwana and former minister Onyango
Midika. They boarded a return flight here on yesterday evening.
</P>
<P>
However, traders allegedly lost business worth millions of
Shillings after police broke up a packed Kibuye market in Kisumu
as they clamped down on Opposition supporters, said the press
reports.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC rally came after the formation of an inter-parties
parliamental group, comprising lawmakers from both the ruling
Kenya African National Union and the Opposition on minimum
constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC has dismissed the group's work and called national
strikes and demonstrations on September 17-18 and October 8-9 to
press the government for total constitutional reforms before the
general elections to be held later this year.
</P>
<P>
But 17 foreign embassies, mainly from western countries,
announced Saturday their support for the parliamental group.
which is to hold a plenary meeting Tuesday on reforms.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, KANU reiterated it will not hold dialogue with the
NCEC as the latter is unregistered, insisting that the reforms
talks should only be undertaken within legal framework.
</P>
<P>
KANU will open its National Delegate Conference on September
16 over reform talks and the forthcoming general elections. At
the KANU conference before the first multi-party election in
1992, Moi was elected as KANU's sole presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Political atmosphere has been tightening in the country
following several rounds of violent clashes between the
government and the Opposition since May, the key loan cut by the
International Monetary Fund and killings on the Coast.
</P>
<P>
Moi has recently claimed time and again that he would announce
the poll date soon.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth Strengthens Democratic Awareness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Village and residential
committees, the public servant system, and people's congress at
all levels provide effective mediums for the Chinese people to
play a more active role in public life.
</P>
<P>
Liu Junnin, a political researcher with the China Academy of
Social Sciences noted that "economic prosperity has cultivated
growing enthusiasm for political participation on the part of
Chinese people, and has indeed sparked a burgeoning democratic
awareness."
</P>
<P>
Economic reforms China adopted since the late 1970s have
encouraged the people to gain wealth through hard work and honest
labor. The country's market economy is striving to open more
options to enhance lifestyles and employment opportunities for the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in rural China, areas which spearheaded economic
reform, directly elect committees to administer daily affairs in
their respective villages, with voter turnout standing at around
90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most villages have introduced the system of village
representative meetings which not only ensure that farmers have a
say in matters directly relating to lives, but also provide an
opportunity for local residents to listen to reports on village
budget management.
</P>
<P>
Similar changes can be found in state enterprises where workers
supervise the management and daily operation through workers
representative meetings.
</P>
<P>
Workers' organizations in some areas directly elect factory
directors and managers, and workers are themselves elected to
serve on board of directors or supervisory commissions.
</P>
<P>
A more transparent public servant system has emerged along with
the deepening of reforms. The State Council decree issued in 1993
stipulates that government functionaries be recruited through open
and fair competitions.
</P>
<P>
Mayor in major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai
have established special hotlines to enable local residents to
offers suggestions or lodge complaints.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980s, the country has promulgated a law on the
organization of village committees, a law on urban residential
committees and a new law governing the election of deputies to
people's congresses.
</P>
<P>
More than 650,000 representatives at county level are preparing
for the election of new local people's congresses. Voters will be
able to participate in direct elections offering a large slate of
candidates.

<HEADLINE> Oman FM Starts Two-Day Visit to Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Omani Foreign Minister
Yousef bin Alawi arrived here today for a two-day visit to
Pakistan with the aim to enhance bilateral economic relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan and Oman have a lot of possibilities for
strengthening the bilateral economic relations specially in areas
of trade and investment," Yousef said at a brief news conference
upon his arrival at the airport here.
</P>
<P>
On the Kashmir issue, Yousef said Oman supports Pak-Indian
dialogue for the settlement of the issue and other outstanding
issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We understand the Kashmir issue should be solved through
negotiations and being neighbor of the two countries our role in
this will be constructive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Afghan situation, Yousef underscored that the
Afghan issue needs to be addressed urgently for development in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"All nations in the region should work for peace in
Afghanistan, and as for Oman, we will extend all possible
assistance in materializing peace in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Pakistan, the Omani foreign minister will
call on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, President Farooq Leghari and
other senior officials in charge of economic and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Pakistan and Oman has been growing in the last
two years. Exports from Pakistan to Oman grew by 9.53 million U.S.
dollars between July 1995 to March 1996 and July 1996 to March
1997, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
A number of projects have also been under discussion including
the setting up of a Pakistan-Oman Joint Holding Company which will
provide a framework and modalities for strengthening economic
cooperation between the two countries, officials said.

<HEADLINE> China's First National Investment And Trade Fair Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China's First National
Investment and Trade Fair opened today in Xiamen, a port city of
East China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The fair, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) and the Fujian provincial and
Xiamen city governments, is the country's first national investment
promotion event designed to attract direct investment from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The fair will focus on attracting foreign investment from
across the world and promoting trade of products manufactured by
joint ventures and foreign-funded enterprises, according to MOFTEC
Vice-Minister Sun Zhenyu.
</P>
<P>
The fair will also feature various exhibitions aiming at
enhancing economic cooperation and trade across the Taiwan
Straits, said Sun.
</P>
<P>
The 37 exhibition halls of the fair will offer a series of
investment projects related to the high-tech sectors and basic
industries, as well as projects in infrastructure and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He added that the fair will also offer famous high quality
products manufactured in Hong Kong, Taiwan and some foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the fair are representatives from coastal,
border and riparian areas, as well as those from central and
western provinces. The event will, in fact, represent a cross
section of the nation, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He said the fair will demonstrate the emergence of a new
pattern with coastal special economic zones as the vanguard, along
with the participation of ministries and provinces, and the
balanced development of eastern and western provinces.
</P>
<P>
Sun emphasized that upgrading the originally Fujian provincial
investment fair to a national event will further raise the
effectiveness, quality and level in the use of overseas
investment. He said the fair will guide and regulate various local
events to introduce investment, facilitate direct contacts between
overseas investors and China's provinces and municipalities, and
gradually alter the practice of sending large delegations overseas
to attract investment.
</P>
<P>
Some 161 delegations consisting of 5,000 businessmen from 27
countries and regions have been here to participate in the fair,
including over 70 delegations from developed countries, and 20
delegations from major transnational corporations.

<HEADLINE> Britain Grants Uganda Sum to Help Reduce Its Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain has decided to grant
Uganda over 6.5 million Pounds (10.5 million US Dollars) to help
reduce its debts burden to the African Development Bank, reported
the local media today.
</P>
<P>
British High Commissioner to Uganda M. Cook confirmed this to
Ugandan Finance Minister Mayanja Nkangi last week.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
agreed on the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative
which, together with regional development banks will reduce the
value of their outstanding loans to eligible countries.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to bring about a once and for all reduction in the
debts of the poorest countries to level that is affordable.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will be the first country to benefit under the HIPC
initiative, having pursued sound economic policies for some 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Britain's bilateral contribution of 10.5 million U.S. Dollars
together with other donor contribution means that the full cost
of reducing Uganda's debt to African Development Bank can now be
met.
</P>
<P>
The grant is in addition to Britain's existing 40 million
Pound (64 million US Dollars) aid program to Uganda.

<P>
SHANGHAI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Most families in Shanghai,
China's largest and most developed industrial city, are rapidly
replacing small screen color television sets with advanced
multifunctional units.
</P>
<P>
According to recent surveys conducted by local banks and
government departments in charge of commerce, some 71.36 percent
of respondents indicated a desire to purchase new, with 56.2
percent indicating a preference for 29 inch screens, 28.1 percent
for 25 inch screens, 8.7 percent for screens measuring 21 inches,
and 4.4 percent for 34 inches.
</P>
<P>
In addition, an increasing number of local residents expressed
their preference for domestic products. Some 62 percent of
respondents noted that they will purchase
domestically-manufactured televisions withing the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Every 100 families in Shanghai currently own an average of
110.65 color television sets, the majority of which are 21 inch
set purchased in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Most families cite the fact that although their old sets are
still workable, they provide access to fewer channels, have small
screens and lack remote control, karaoke and VCD capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Improved living standards have also contributed to expanding
desire for state-of-the-art television sets. Moreover, falling
prices and efforts by manufacturers and dealers to improve
services have contributed to the increasing sales volume for color
television sets.
</P>
<P>
Prices on the local market have, in fact, dropped by around 30
percent over the past two years alone.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Bans Kenya Airline in Row over Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- African Airlines
International (AAI), a private Kenyan carrier, has been banned
from Tanzanian air-space because it made a sanctions-busting
flight to Burundi, the East African weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Tanzanian Foreign Ministry said his
ministry banned last week any further flights by the AAI through
Tanzanian air-space under the sanctions agreement. The airline
flew from Nairobi to Bujumbura on July 17.
</P>
<P>
It appeared the airline had deliberately tried to mislead
Tanzania about its destination by lying it was going to the
Democratic Republic of Congo at the time, the spokesman said,
adding the ban is indefinite.
</P>
<P>
The air ban is the latest in a flurry of efforts to keep
sanctions going against Burundi in face of increasing evidence
that the embargo is being widely breached.
</P>
<P>
The Great Lakes leaders agreed conditionally at a summit in
Dar es Salaam Thursday to seek a global oil and arms embargo
against the central African nation, to press for the severance of
diplomatic relations worldwide and to move for seizure of all
Burundi government assets abroad.
</P>
<P>
The summit also pledged to continue regional sanctions
implemented in July 1996 after Major Pierre Buyoya seized power
in Burundi in a bloodless military coup.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi failed to attend the
summit.

for Lebanese detainees incarcerated in Israel, local press said
today.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, said there is no doubt that the
remains will only be swapped for detainees (not dead guerrillas).
</P>
<P>
"A swap is in our interest because the issue of detainees in
Israeli jails is of the utmost importance to us," he said, quoted
by local press.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, and the Shiite Muslim Amal movement led by Lebanon's
House Speaker Nabih Berri, are the two major anti-Israeli military
groups in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The remains of Israeli commandos, who were killed when being
ambushed by Lebanese guerrillas and soldiers in south Lebanon last
Friday, is being kept by the Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Israeli soldiers were killed, four wounded and one
missing but believed to also be killed, in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
"More than one side has contacted us regarding a swap,"
Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
However, he denied having been approached by the Americans. The
Israelis have reportedly contacted the U.S. to initiate a swap.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has not tried to contact us and if they do we will not
lift the telephone receiver," he said, adding that he expected the
swap to take place within a month.

<HEADLINE> India's Economy to Grow by 6-7 Percent in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- India's economic prospects
for 1997-98 (april,1997-march 31,1998) are favorable and the
growth rate could be at six to seven percent, said the annual
report of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which is made public
here today.
</P>
<P>
There is growing recognition that it is possible to achieve and
sustain real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of seven
percent or more in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The average real GDP growth rate during the Eighth Five-Year
Plan (1992-97), estimated to be at 6.5 percent, was distinctly
higher than the targeted growth rate of 5.6 percent. More
importantly, the real GDP growth rate during the last three years
averaged over seven percent, which was not only unprecedented for
the economy but also impressive in terms of cross-country
comparisons, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The high growth performance has been achieved along with
notable improvement in several macro-economic fundamentals in the
economy including a lower order of fiscal deficit, a higher saving
rate, a moderation in price increase, sustainable external
payments situation and a relatively stable exchange rate
environment.
</P>
<P>
"The constraints on growth are no longer the availability of
domestic savings or external resources as they used to be earlier.
the limit to overall growth will be set by physical constraints
such as lack of infrastructure facilities and inadequate growth in
agriculture. Besides, it is necessary to ensure a stable financial
environment of which fiscal consolidation must be an integral
part," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Panama Confident in Canal's Handover in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Panama has the confidence
and ability to run the Panama Canal efficiently and competitively
after its handover by the United States in 1999.
</P>
<P>
President Ernesto Perez Balladares said this today at the
opening ceremony of an International Panama Canal Conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the main purpose of the meeting is to make it known
that the Panamanian government has made all efforts to prepare for
the Canal's handover in 1999. "And now we can say preparations are
well done."
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government has revised some of its Constitution
articles to ensure the independent administrative and financial
management of the canal by the Canal Authority of Panama, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which ends Wednesday, will focus on the
technical issues associated with the canal's handover,
maintenance, increasing locks reliability and long-term expansion
plans such as building a third set of locks.
</P>
<P>
The conference was also held in memory of the 20th anniversary
of the signing of the Panama Canal Treaty on September 7,
1977. According to the treaty, the United States will handover the
canal to Panama and withdraw its troops and military presence in
the Panama Canal region before December 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Pak President Calls for Improvement of Literacy Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 8 (Xinhua) -- President Farooq Leghari
today urged the government to take effective measures to improve
the country's dismal literacy rate, saying otherwise Pakistan
cannot ensure its survival in the increasingly competitive world.
</P>
<P>
"To flourish in the new global markets of the 21st century are
likely only those nations which achieve a very high level of
education, skills and technology," Leghari said in his message on
International Literacy day being observed throughout the world
today.
</P>
<P>
If Pakistan, whose literacy rate is around 30 percent, has to
ensure its survival in this competitive world, he said, it is
imperative that "we invest judiciously in the education sector."
</P>
<P>
"It is rather painful for us to note that our literacy rate is
among the lowest in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The President said education played a central place in the
process of nation building.
</P>
<P>
"It is a means by which nations acquire collective identity and
consciousness which in turn contributes towards national pride,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the whole society to join hands with the government in
the monumental task of tackling literacy.
</P>
<P>
The government is devoting special attention towards education
in its development agenda, he said, but it must be recognized that
this task cannot be effectively handled through government
resources alone.
</P>
<P>
While the government will take the lead, all segments of the
society, particularly non-governmental organizations, must step
forward and participate in this national endeavor, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan government has
decided to install an air pollution monitoring system in the
capital and other major cities to gauge ratio of air pollution,
officials said today.
</P>
<P>
A vigorous campaign is also being launched all over the country
against pollution and to create awareness against smoke, noise,
industrial waste and other types of pollution among the people,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly has recently approved a legislation
providing for the protection, conservation, rehabilitation and
improvement of environment in the country.
</P>
<P>
This legislation, the officials said, would enable the
government to establish special tribunals to award punishment for
violation of its provisions.
</P>
<P>
The problem of environmental pollution in Pakistan has been
gradually becoming acute primarily because of increasing
industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
During the past two decades, the ratio of forests in the
country has also dwindled considerably due to indiscriminate
cutting of trees in the mountainous areas.

<HEADLINE> International Anti-Corruption Conference Opens in Lima </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The eighth international
anti-corruption conference opened here today, expecting to
emphasize public participation in the fight against one of the
serious social evils in the world.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by representatives from more than
80 countries and regions and world organizations.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the conference, Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori called for developing "a culture of faith" while
combating corruption.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said that people's efforts for peace, development and
a better life were wasted as a result of corruption and
embezzlement of huge public funds.
</P>
<P>
Accepting kickbacks, taking bribes and power abuse should be
considered as "monsters that swallow up the public funds which
could have been used to create a bright future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to promote moral education for teenagers
in the battle against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Feng Tiyun, head of the Chinese delegation attending the
conference, who is a vice-minister of the Chinese Ministry of
Supervision, said on the occasion that since introducing reform
and opening-up policies, China has laid emphasis on the combat
against corruption while carrying out economic construction, and
has thus made remarkable progress in coordinating its economic and
social development.
</P>
<P>
During the conference which will end on Thursday, the
participants will exchange their experience in fighting
corruption.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Police Cracks Down on Colombo's Underworld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Colombo Detective Bureau
(CDB) was able to put a stop to internecine killings by launching
a massive crackdown on Colombo's underworld, local reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
In the past several weeks, the CDB has arrested 17 key suspects
of local rival gangs, who were competing for the city's narcotics
market, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
"We have evidence to prove that those so far arrested are
responsible for 18 of the over 40 drug-related murders committed
since 1995," CDB sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A large quantity of weapons and ammunitions, including
automatic pistols, revolvers and grenades, were recovered from the
possession of the suspects and their hide-outs in the crackdown.
But the CDB admitted that there is still more to be recovered.
</P>
<P>
CDB sources said the arsenal, which these suspects possessed,
pointed to the possibility of their being contracted by terrorists
to carry out acts of destruction and even assassinations in
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The CDB is also investigating the possibility of the city's
underworld having Tamil rebels connections.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the CDB was able to disturb cells of
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) operating in the city
and its suburbs, with the arrests of 17 terrorists, including some
of their key leaders.
</P>
<P>
Drug-traffickers often use boats and planes as means of
transportation to carry heroin into this island nation, from which
they could smuggle the drugs into India. Generally three to five
kilograms of heroin are brought in on a single run.

NEW DELHI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- With 29 million vehicles on

</P>

The majority of the deaths due to road accidents were
preventable, but due to poor transportation facility, non-existent
information and communication network and poorly maintained
hospitals, people died, the paper quoted President of the Indian
Medical Association-East Dr. Ashwini Malhotra as saying.
</P>
<P>
A coordinated effort is needed at various levels to reduce the
incidence of preventable mortality, Dr. Daljeet Singh said.

JAKARTA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States has extended
trade facilities to Indonesia under the terms of the generalized
system of preferences (GSP) until June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Antara news agency today quoted a report from the Indonesian
Trade and Industry Ministry as saying that the document signed by
U.S. President Clinton in August.
</P>
<P>
The GSP facility for Indonesia has actually expired on May 31,
1997. However, as the facility still played an important role in
boosting Indonesia's exports to the United States, the Indonesian
government has been consistently lobbying that country, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has in the past come under attack for its labor
policies, which prompted U.S. officials to investigate whether or
not to cut off trade privileges.
</P>
<P>
Antara noted that the U.S. Congress had once petitioned that
the privileges be withdrawn because of the improvement in the
Indonesian economy.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Central Bank: Rupiah Won't Fall Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- There should be no further
fall in the Indonesian currency of rupiah as rapid depreciation
over the past few weeks has corrected it, a spokesman of Bank
Indonesia (BI), the central bank, predicted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of Southeast Asian foreign exchange
dealers held in Bali, Indonesia, on Saturday, BI managing director
Paul Soetopo Tjokronegoro said market perception that the rupiah
was slightly overvalued had triggered recent volatility, according
to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Central banks from the Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore met
with foreign exchange dealers in a closed-door conference in Bali,
in a move that was regarded as a way of combating the currency
instability in the region, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
"This overvaluation has certainly been corrected now by the
depreciation we have experienced since July," Paul said in his
keynote address.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the rupiah had fallen by some 20 percent in two
months.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah ended on Friday at 2,970 against the U.S. dollar, up
from 3,035 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the head of the Monetary Management Department at
Bank Indonesia, C. Harinowo, who represented the bank at the
meeting, said no conclusions had been reached during the talks.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed what had happened lately and what steps we had
taken to address this," Harinowo said. "There was nothing special
in this meeting."
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian currencies have been under speculative attacks
in the past few weeks, beginning with the Thai baht. The contagion
effect spread over Southeast Asia, first to the Philippine peso,
then moving to the Malaysian ringgit, the Indonesian rupiah and
even the Singapore dollar.
</P>
<P>
Some economic analysts said that the currency volatility is not
over yet.

<HEADLINE> Italy Hopes to Launch European Currency Next Spring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Romano Prodi said
today Italy has no intention to propose a postponement for the
launch of the European single currency and would be prepared to
see it launched as early as next spring.
</P>
<P>
His comments made in an interview with the Spanish newspaper
ABC came only a few days after Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
indicated that he would be happy to see the currency launch,
officially scheduled for January 1, 1999, postponed for a year.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said Italy was quite ready to be part of the currency
when launched and had no intention of proposing a postponement.
</P>
<P>
"We would even, in theory, be prepared to bring entry forward,"
he said. He indicated that Europe should be united in view of the
world economic trends and the competition coming from Asia.
</P>
<P>
On the question of bringing forward the launch of the Euro, he
noted that time was anyway short, but said it would not be "such
an absurdity, to the extent that Italy would be prepared to do it
even in the spring of next year."
</P>
<P>
The longer the delay, "the greater the chance of speculation
and the more vulnerable our currency will become," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi added, "In a couple of months all the economic data of
all the countries will be clear and therefore it would be possible
to anticipate entry to it."
</P>
<P>
He added that the crucial thing was that the launch should not
be delayed. Asked about current problems for Europe resulting from
the weakness of the German economy, Prodi said he believed that
weakness was only temporary, caused by the cost of unification.

HONG KONG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Everything has been going
very well with preparations for the upcoming World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings, said Tim
Cullen, representative of the World Bank in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We've established a fairly good relationship with the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and the arrangements being carried
 out by the HKMA are quite satisfactory," said Cullen in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The WB and IMF annual meetings and the many related seminars,
to take place in Hong Kong from the middle of this month, will be
 attended by state leaders, finance ministers and central bank
governors from 181 member countries and regions, as well as
officials of international organizations and private bankers.
</P>
<P>
A senior advisor of the World Bank, Cullen was sent to Hong
Kong to coordinate between the World Bank and the HKMA the
preparations for the meetings.
</P>
<P>
"The HKMA is a tremendous partner of the World Bank in this
effort," he said. "I think people from the World Bank who are in
charge of the annual meetings should feel this is really one of
the best experiences they have had in working with a local
authority."
</P>
<P>
He said that for China this is really a good opportunity just
three months after the handover to be able to demonstrate to the
world's financial community that "one country, two systems" is
working very well, and Hong Kong continues to be a very major
financial center in this region.
</P>
<P>
"Having the World Bank and IMF meetings here, along with all
the private bankers who will come as well, is in a way a vote of
confidence in Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the venue for the meetings, there has to be a
really large good conference center which can hold a very large
number of people, and Hong Kong's new convention center is
obviously outstanding in this respect. In addition, Hong Kong has
a lot of good hotels which can hold all the attendants coming to
the meetings.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is a modern city right in the heart of East Asia,
while the World Bank has many very important clients in this
region. It's the opportunity for all of the people coming to the
meetings to look at the economic progress being made in East Asia
and to look at the challenges that East Asia still faces in the
years ahead," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about impressions of Hong Kong, Cullen said he found
Hong Kong is a very efficient, friendly and energetic place.
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting of being in Hong Kong at the moment when
there is the currency turmoil in a number of East Asian countries,
 and yet Hong Kong dollar remains very stable," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said this demonstrates that Hong Kong is a very solid
financial community in this region. It has a very well managed
financial system, and a huge amount of foreign reserves in hard
currency. Its economic system gives a lot of freedom of activity
for business.
</P>
<P>
Turmoil in East Asian financial markets will certainly be a
topic of discussion at the meetings, he added. The reason is that
people are coming to really discuss whatever issue is important
at the time, in addition to a number of things that are always
important, like the debt of poor countries and the infrastructure
needs in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The meetings will devote a whole day to China-related topics,
and the World Bank has prepared a special report "China 2020",

"China is a country which is in a process of transition to a
market economy, and it's a country which still has a lot of
challenges ahead. Everybody is interested in what is happening in
China," Cullen said.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank has a very good relationship with
China. At the moment China is the largest borrower from the World
Bank. Over the past years the Chinese government has successfully
managed to improve the life of many poor people, although it has a
 long way ahead to go in completely eliminating poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said through these seminars and meetings, more private
sector money may flow into China to help meet its challenges in
the areas such as poverty-relief, infrastructure and environmental
 issues.
</P>
<P>
The annual meetings, expecting some 2,500 country delegates,
6,000 to 7,000 private bankers, as well as over 2,000 journalists
and many non-governmental organization representatives, will be
the largest ever in WB and IMF history, he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Spread Warned Among Cambodian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Thai health officials in Surin
province in northeastern Thailand are warning that malaria may
spread at a temporary Cambodian refugee camp in the province's Kap
Choeng district, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
An increase in the number of malaria patients has been noticed
since July this year, said Jaturong Teerakanok, health chief of
Surin province.
</P>
<P>
The situation is likely to worsen rapidly at this time of the
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
From July 1 to September 4, 106 patients have been admitted to
Kap Choeng hospital due to malaria, Jaturong said.
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of malaria patients were reportedly due
to the rainy season and cross border travels, especially the
influx of Cambodian refugees who escaped the recent fighting in
their country.
</P>
<P>
The Thai authorities have sent malaria control units to the
camp and began to test all children there.

<HEADLINE> TV Manufacturers Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua)-- Two major Chinese electronics
companies have adopted the merger strategy to ensure their mutual
survival in the increasingly competitive market.
</P>
<P>
The TCL group based in South China's Guangdong Province and
Meile Electronics Co. Ltd. in North China's Henan Province jointly
established the Henan TCL and Meile Electronics Company. The new
company will manufacture both TCL and Meile brands color TVs,
according to a recent issue of "China Electronics News".
</P>
<P>
The company will become the first in China's color TV
manufacturing sector to produce two brands of color televisions.
</P>
<P>
Local economic analysts believe the establishment of the
company has set a new model in terms of state-owned
enterprises integration and the cooperation between firms in the
country's coastal and inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The new joint venture, based in Henan Province, has a total
registered capital of 115 million yuan and plans to produce one
million color TV sets annually during a cooperative term of 50
years.
</P>
<P>
TCL group, which holds a 52 percent of the joint venture
capital, and the Meile Corp. are both on the list of China's 50
most competitive electronics companies.
</P>
<P>
Since last spring, many of the nation's color TV producers have
lowered prices to gain a greater share of the highly competitive
market. The Changhong Group, China's largest color TV
manufacturer, reduced prices for its series of products by some
8-18 percent.
</P>
<P>
A 25-inch color TV currently costs around 3,000 yuan, down
some 1,300 yuan, or about 30 percent on the price in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Italian President Calls for Unity Against Secession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro today expressed support for the Italian government's
warnings to the country's secessionist Northern League against
holding self-styled Padania elections later this autumn.
</P>
<P>
The league, led by Umberto Bossi, has agitated for the
secession of the wealthy northern region in Italy which it calls
Padania and has announced parliament elections in Padania on
October 26.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi warned last week that the
government might call in the legal authorities if the organization
persisted with its plans. But Bossi threatened immediately to use
the courts against political opponents.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro said Prodi "was right to warn citizens that what is
planned for the October election is something outside and against
the constitution."
</P>
<P>
Prodi and nine of his ministers visited the northeastern region
of Veneto in Italy Saturday, a stronghold of the league, to spread
the unity message.
</P>
<P>
He said in a speech that "there is really no room for those who
divide. The process that is going on in Europe is one of
integration, not disintegration."
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro called for the "commitment of the people to work
together in harmony to move the country forward on the road to
civilization."

BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China recently established a

<P>
The center, which operates under the Film Bureau, is
responsible for organizing talented people to write high quality
scripts, and also purchases stories and outlines which can be
adapted into films.
</P>
<P>
Low payments have created a lack of high quality film scripts
and hindered the development of the film industry. The problem has
been compounded due to a shortage of funding.

China has also launched a nationwide program to solicit

Guangming Daily, a leading newspaper that targets
intellectuals, publishes the column "Monthly Focus," which deals
with a key issue that has gained prominence over the past month.
</P>
<P>
One report told about a senior agronomist in Shaanxi Province
who spent 20 years improving the productivity and quality of a
strain of black rice. The improved variety brought riches to many,
but the research institute where the man worked was on the verge
of bankruptcy, and the agronomist had a tough time providing for
his family.
</P>
<P>
The story is representative of the type of trouble faced by
many agricultural experts, and dozens of newspapers and magazines
re-printed the column. As a result, agricultural experts across
the country wrote letters to the Guangming Daily soliciting help
for the man. And after reading the report, Shaanxi's top
government and Party officials immediately instructed provincial
and local authorities to appropriate 100,000 yuan for the research
institute.
</P>
<P>

the Chinese media, which has been facilitated by the country's
reform and opening-up, said Xu Renzhong, chief of Xinhua's

means of relaying common people's wishes," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of probing reports not only is to simply
uncover them, but also to raise the public's awareness and that of
the government departments in charge, so that solutions can be
found.

<HEADLINE> Expert Designs Future Stock Trading Web In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Consider this scenario: One
morning in the future, an investor reads data from the previous
day's stock trading on his PC, then logs on to the computerized
stock trading system to buy or sell stocks.
</P>
<P>
And when he travels, he keeps close tabs on the stock market
using his portable computer notebook, counting his gains and
losses or exchanging views with other investors via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
Chinese computer expert Deng Yihui says all this and more will
soon be a reality in China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent international financial conference held in
Shanghai, the leading financial hub in the country, Deng called
for the acceleration of the networking of China's stock market,
and said he has just the plan to get it started.
</P>
<P>
China has a sound foundation for expanding its stock business
through the information web, Deng said, noting the country's stock
markets adopted the then-most advanced computerized telecom-webs
for automatic trading when they were set up.
</P>
<P>
The securities business has taken the lead in the country's
information revolution so as to meet the requirements of the
fast-developing stock market, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the expert, there were over 100,000 computers in
the country operating synchronously on trading days to become one
of the largest computer networks in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the existing network is far from satisfying the needs
of millions of Chinese investors who are eager to obtain
sufficient, authoritative information locally and on time.
</P>
<P>
All listed companies, stock trade administrators and
policy-makers are in urgent need of a fair, well-developed stock
trading information system, Deng said.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, the Chinese net expert put forward his own
creation, dubbed the "6A Comprehensive Stock Service Platform."
The six A's refer to "any time, any place, any body, any client,
any information and any service," he said.
</P>
<P>
His plan calls for the connecting of the existing national
stock trading networks as well as the Internet, and it will be
under the control of an authoritative board to unify the
management, collect data, balance the information flow, and
process the data that have entered the web.
</P>
<P>
The system will set up trunk lines hooked up to a number of
stations in large cities like Beijing and Shanghai, with every
station managing part of the network.
</P>
<P>
Existing telecommunicational networks and the public network
facilities will be used, while families will be the main clients.
</P>
<P>
As the proposed project is a huge one, experts have to plan,
design and set rules for the system in advance, and emphasis
should be put on studies over some key technology concerned, so as
to set up the network in the shortest possible time, Deng
said.

"If the value of an investigative program is only measured by
mudslinging, it's popularity won't last," said Fang Hongjin, a
journalist working for CCTV's Focus Report.
</P>
<P>
In-depth reports have also caught the enthusiastic attention of
the higher echelon of state leaders, and have become a magnifying
glass through which officials at all levels can check their work.
</P>
<P>
Focus Report once reported an incident in Huaiyang County in
the central province of Henan, which said that due to poor
management of the county's grain mill, a total of 880,000 kg
of state grain reserve was damaged by mice and bugs.
</P>
<P>
A Focus Report journalist demanded an explanation from county
Party secretary Li Zhengting, and was told: "Isn't just some one
million kg of grain? So what?"
</P>
<P>
Senior Chinese officials read the report, and the Party
secretary was suspended from his post three days later.
</P>
<P>
As one provincial Party secretary said: "No government can be
free of problems in the workplace. Once a problem arises, don't
try to conceal it -- reveal and solve it."
</P>
<P>
He said that should Focus Report ever uncover any problems in
his province, he would discuss the allegations with local
officials.

NANJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The last group of 930,000
rural families have bade farewell to the days of no electricity,
with the 360,000 villages in east China's Jiangsu Province having
access to electrification.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government introduced a rural electrification
program to help poverty-stricken villagers in remote and
economically backward area achieve overall economic development.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu launched its "Bright Project" in 1995 and since
allocated some 700 million yuan for building and improving
power transmission and transformation facilities.
</P>
<P>
Rural areas currently account for some 56 percent of the
province's power consumption, and the electrification program has
led to the establishment of a large number of township and
village industrial enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Crushes Williams to Win U.S. Open Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Top-seed Martina Hingis of
Switzerland Sunday beat American rising star Venus Williams 2-0 to
win the women's singles title at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
The world number one Hingis extended her extraordinary season
record to 63-2 with a 6-0, 6-4 demolition of the unseeded Williams
in the youngest Grand Slam final.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Hingis, displaying an outstanding array of
shots, thoroughly outclassed the 17-year-old Williams. Hingis
swept through the first set in just 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Girl pounded the ball confidently from both sides,
controlling virtually every point against Williams, who made 38
unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
Though Williams managed to hold in the opening game of the
second set after fighting off two break points, Hingis broke
through again on her next service game for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
Williams then appeared ready to make a match of it when she
broke Hingis to even the match at 4-4, but Hingis wasted little
time exerting her superiority. The Swiss broke right back for a
5-4 lead and won the match on her first match point with a
forehand volley down the line.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who reached all four Grand Slam finals, became the
sixth women's player, and the youngest, to win three or more major
titles in a single season.
</P>
<P>
She claimed the Australian Open and Wimbledon prior to the U.S.
Open. The only miss for the Swiss was at the French Open, where
she came back from a six-week layoff following a horse riding
accident to reach the final before losing to Croatian Iva Majoli.
</P>
<P>
Hingis earned 650,000 U.S. dollars for the victory and
Williams, who was the first unseeded player ever to reach the
women's singles final of the U.S. Open, collected 350,000
dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Patrick Rafter of Australia
defeated unseeded Greg Rusedski of Britain 3-2 in the final to
win the title of the 10.12 million dollars U.S. Open tennis
championships in New York Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Claiming his first major title this year with a 6-3, 6-2, 4-6,
7-5 victory, Rafter became the first Australian in 24 years to
win the U.S. Open. He also ended his futility in championship
matches this year, having reached the finals five times without a
triumph.
</P>
<P>
The 13th seeded Rafter dominated play over the first two sets
with his attacking style. He broke to go up 4-2 in the first set
and then broke early in the second set as well to close out the
first two sets in one hour.
</P>
<P>
The victory moves 24-year-old Rafter to a career-high No. 3
world ranking behind Pete Sampras and Michael Chang. He won the
highest 650,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski, who was born in Canada and moved to Britain two
years ago, was the first British player since Fred Perry in 1936
to reach the U.S. Open final.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier match, top-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland
beat American Venus Williams 2-0 to claim the title of the
women's singles.

<HEADLINE> Germany Qualifies for Under-17 Quarter-finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany booked a quarter-final
seat at the Under-17 World Soccer Championship after beating
Thailand on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Costa Rica were ousted after losing two matches
apiece in their group matches.
</P>
<P>
On the fourth day of the championship, four games were played
in Cairo and the Mediterranean city of Port Said.
</P>
<P>
Germany defeated Thailand 3-0 to top Group A where Egypt and
Chile were the other teams.
</P>
<P>
In another Group A match on Sunday, Egypt tied with Chile 1-1
after conceding a 1-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
This result landed Egypt in a precarious situation, with a
ticket to the last eight depending on either its win over the
powerful German team or Chile's loss to the disheartened Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, defending champion Ghana scored a
convincing 5-1 victory over Bahrain at Port Said.
</P>
<P>
Ghanian players were in control from the very beginning,
scoring twice in the seventh and ninth minute.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanian squad continued its attacks in the second half and
scored a third goal in the 17th minute.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain got one goal back at the 26th minute before Ghana
pulled away with two more goals.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica was edged out of the championship after losing to
Argentina 1-0 in a Group D match in Port Said stadium. The lone
goal came at the 23rd minute.
</P>
<P>
With Ghana and Egypt each getting a red card on Sunday, four
red cards have been issued in the event.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen teams from five continents are competing in the
championship which opened here Thursday night and will run until
September 21. It is the first time that Egypt hosts a FIFA event.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- It's the prime-time viewing
hour on Chinese TV, and flashing across screens nationwide is a
purchasing agent for a Shanghai textile mill desperately trying to
explain why he sold 20,000 yuan-worth of contaminated cotton to an
unsuspecting buyer.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the distraught man admits on-camera that he accepted a
bribe to commit the fraud.
</P>
<P>
It's a typical scene from "Focus Report," one of many popular
programs emerging from a new media trend in the country, which uses
investigative journalism to examine problems plaguing modern-day
Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
Since it was first aired on April 1, 1994, by China Central
Television (CCTV), the show has led CCTV'S ratings for all regular
programming due to its bold coverage of issues and follow-ups on
the stories.
</P>
<P>
In the print media, Outlook, China's leading weekly
news-magazine, carried in its first issue in 1994 a column called
"Eye on Important Issues" -- a close cousin of CCTV's Focus Report.
</P>
<P>
One column uncovered a case in a central China city involving
the all-too-common tendency of some officials to falsify
statistics about work reports and performance.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that such corruption must be
checked. Well received by readers, the report had widespread
social repercussions.

<HEADLINE> European Paper Industry Lackluster in 1996: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The European paper industry
logged a weak performance in 1996, according to the Confederation
of European Paper Industries (CEPI), in its recently published
annual report.
</P>
<P>
A slower rate of production in 1995 continued into the first
quarter of 1996. The trend was reversed when activity perked up in
the second half of the year, but the performance for the whole of
1996 was far from outstanding, says the report.
</P>
<P>
Paper and board production in 1996 declined slightly by 0.7
percent to 72.8 million tons in Europe, half a million tons
below the 1995 level but still higher than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Total exports increased slightly by 0.7 percent to 41.1 million
tons and imports increased by 0.5 percent to 34 million,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
After two years of firm increases -- 5.1 percent in 1994 and
4.2 percent in 1995, newsprint production fell strongly by 4.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The CEPI says it does not expect any major change in 1997,
adding that the recovery experienced during the first half of 1997
is unlikely to continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Production of textiles in the
European Union (EU) rose by 1.7 percent during the first quarter
of 1997, after a decline spanning seven consecutive quarters,
according to the most recent quarterly bulletin of the European
Observatory of Textiles and Clothing.
</P>
<P>
Most of the EU member states, in particular Finland, Greece and
Belgium, recorded higher textiles production, though output in
Denmark plunged.
</P>
<P>
However, the decline in clothing production continued during
the first quarter of 1997. Belgium suffered the sharpest drop at
21.4 percent while Sweden's industry grew by 19.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The EU's imports of textile products continued to expand during
the last quarter of 1996. During 1996 as a whole, exports of
textiles increased by 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports to other EU nations and third countries rose in nearly
half the member states during 1996 and fell in the other half. The
largest positive change was seen in Greece while Belgium and
Ireland recorded large decreases.
</P>
<P>
Exports of clothing to third countries grew strongly during the
last quarter of 1996 and by 11.2 percent for the year as a whole,
says the report.

items in leading Australian newspapers published today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Environment Minister Robert Hill, the most senior republican
in Prime Minister John Howard's government, Sunday urged prominent
Australians with open minds on the question to seek election to
next year's constitutional convention. Pro-republicans aim to
reach a consensus at the convention on the question whether
Australia should become a republic.

-- The federal cabinet will try to find a middle-ground
position on cuts to textile, clothing and footwear tariffs
tomorrow after business groups and the National Party's senior
figures took opposing positions Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's recent changes to its tax law are threatening to
freeze out Australian firms from 146 billion US dollars worth of
major privatization over the next 10 years. The changes mean the
foreign companies, particularly from the U.S. and Asia, are in a
better book and cash flow position to make competitive bids for
Australian infrastructure projects.

<HEADLINE> German Politician Calls for 5-Year Delay on Euro Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The debate among German
politicians on the introduction of the planned single European
currency, the Euro, heated up again on Sunday when a German state
premier made a concrete call for a five-year delay for its launch.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German newspaper Bild on Sunday, Kurt
Biedenkopf, premier of the German state of Saxony, indicated that
he doubted that the European Union (EU) would be ready for the
introduction of the Euro on the planned startup date of January 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the EU should delay the Euro for five years
to enable its member states to meet all the preconditions for a
common currency. During the interim period, the 16 EU states
should first introduce fixed exchange rates between their
different currencies, he added.
</P>
<P>
Biedenkopf, a senior member of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, made the call just
days after leaders of the CDU and its sister party Christian
Social Union (CSU) agreed during a summit meeting to put an end to
the Euro debate in Germany and pledged to hold on to its punctual
start.
</P>
<P>
Germany has stirred up controversies in European capitals last
week when Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's central bank,
said in a newspaper interview that a delay of the Euro would not
be "a disaster".
</P>
<P>
In order to quell speculations that Bonn is now in favor of
delaying the Euro, both Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel made statements later saying that Germany would still stick
to the Euro timetable with strict adherence to the qualification
criteria.
</P>
<P>
Despite the assurances, the Euro debate apparently continues in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Biedenkopf, Edmund Stoiber, premier of the German
state of Bavaria and a well-known Euro sceptic, on Sunday also
repeat his call for a Euro delay.
</P>
<P>
"The Euro should not be allowed to be created at any price," he
was quoted by German media as saying.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German business daily Handelsblatt,
Hans-Peter Stihl, leader of the German umbrella organization of
chambers of commerce DIHT, also said he agreed that a delay of the
Euro would not be an economic disaster so long as another
timetable was agreed upon.

<HEADLINE> EU Welcomes Albright Visit to Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Luxembourg Foreign
Minister and acting President of the Council of the European
Union, Jacques F. Poos, today expressed his support for U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's decision to tour the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that your initiative will contribute greatly to
reactivating the search for peace in the region" at this critical
moment of the peace process, Poos said in a letter addressed to
Mrs Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to go to the Middle East this week on her
first visit to the region since becoming secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
He added, "As far as the European Union is concerned, you will
not be alone in this challenging task."
</P>
<P>
Mr. Poos said that the EU was "particularly concerned to ensure
Israeli commitment to the next phase of redeployment, which is an
essential pre-requisite of the Interim Agreement."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the EU regarded "full and sustained
Palestinian cooperation" in the field of security as essential to
continued progress in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"In short, we regard it as essential that any restarting of the
Final Status negotiations should be accompanied by parallel
implementation of the Interim Agreement in all its aspects,
including the Hebron protocol," he emphasized in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Poos expressed the hope that both sides should avoid
unilateral acts which he believed would have a negative impact on
attempts to restart negotiations.
</P>
<P>
As a first step towards such a resuming of the peace process,
Mr. Poos said that it would be very useful if the parties
concerned could agree on a code of conduct, taking the above
points into account.
</P>
<P>
The EU has proposed the creation of a Permanent Security
Committee enabling both parties to effect joint crisis management
and possibly including U.S. and EU participation in addition to
the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
On the short term, Mr. Poos regards "urgent action on lifting
the obstacles facing the Palestinian economy" as indispensable.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Poos expressed his satisfaction that Mrs Albright would
include Syria in her tour, saying, "The principle Land for Peace
should also apply to the Syrian and Lebanese tracks."
</P>
<P>
He therefore added that it would be very useful if Albright
would visit Lebanon as well.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Poos concluded by emphasizing that the EU would continue to
lend all its support to the region and insisted on the great
importance the EU attaches to Mrs Albright's tour in the Middle
East.
