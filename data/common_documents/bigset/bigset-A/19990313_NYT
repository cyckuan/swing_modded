</P>
<P>
   Beautiful March weather. Booming economy. Major League Baseball
coming off its most thrilling season in many a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cactus League couldn't ask for more, and officials expect to
break attendance records this year.
</P>
<P>
   And _ get ready _ it could get even sweeter with two more teams
possibly on the way.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, the storied Los Angeles Dodgers
and one other team would boost the league to an even dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Cities such as Yuma, former home of the San Diego Padres, and
Marana have expressed interest in hosting a team.
</P>
<P>
   But there are challenges facing Arizona, too.
</P>
<P>
   The car-rental tax that has paid for improvements to Cactus
League facilities won't have any money available for new projects
for at least a decade. Arizona officials worry about Las Vegas,
which hosts some exhibition games each March and has thousands of
new hotel rooms to fill, making a serious pitch for spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   After a challenge from Florida to lure the Chicago Cubs and
other teams to the Grapefruit League in the late 1980s, more than
$160 million has been spent on Cactus League facilities, and
Arizona claims to be king.
</P>
<P>
   ``Top to bottom, we have the best facilities for spring training
bar none,'' said Michael Scully, executive director of the Maricopa
County Sports Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look around the Valley and Tucson, you'll see what he
means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to the turnaround was the `t' word nobody wants to
hear about,'' said Scully, referring to a rental-vehicle tax that
has financed most of the improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.50-per-rental tax in Maricopa County ($3.50 in Pima
County) won't be paying for new facilities any time soon. All of
the expected $5 million or so projected to be generated each year
throughout the next decade is earmarked to pay for existing
facilities, said Chris Baier, sports development director for the
Arizona Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't stop the Cactus League from expanding.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and the Fort McDowell Yavapai-Apache Indian Tribe
have been discussing terms of a proposed $20 million to $30 million
complex on the reservation that would boast a 12,500-seat stadium
paid for by the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's envisioned that the tribe would pay for the facilities,
but to justify it they need to make sure they get a return,'' Baier
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal officials will only confirm that negotiations continue.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Coons, business development director for the Dodgers, said
the team will also weigh proposals from Vero Beach, Fla., city and
county officials to improve the club's situation there, but he said
talks won't heat up until after spring training. The Dodgers want
their new staff, led by Manager Davey Johnson, to experience a
spring in Vero Beach before pressing ahead with a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Until and if a deal is finalized, it won't be known when a new
stadium here could be completed, but it's unlikely it would be in
time for next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The practice fields could be finished in time for 2000, meaning
the Dodgers would have to work out a deal to share a stadium with
another team for one year. That most likely would be Scottsdale
Stadium, spring home of the San Francisco Giants, although Phoenix
Municipal Stadium, where the Oakland Athletics train, is another
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   In 2001, the Dodgers could be joined by another team at their
complex in an arrangement similar to Peoria Sports Complex or
Tucson Electric Park, both of which house two teams. Possible teams
mentioned by officials include the Toronto Blue Jays, Houston
Astros, Texas Rangers, Kansas City Royals and even the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This league is going to strengthen itself even further over
the next few years,'' Scully said.
</P>
<P>
   Baier calls the Dodger proposition a 50-50 chance, ``but there's
so many things that make more sense about Arizona than Florida for
the Dodgers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Holman Stadium at Dodgertown holds 6,500 and has limited
revenue potential. Los Angeles is an hour from Phoenix by air, and
the new-look, Fox-owned Dodgers could better market spring training
to hometown fans and sponsors, who are reluctant to make the
cross-country trek to Florida and then face a long drive to
isolated Vero Beach. Another key factor is the convenience of
travel for players, easing player development in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what Florida does, they can't compete with all
that,'' Baier said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers' emotional, 50-year ties to Vero Beach and a
community campaign to keep the team will be weighed heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a large part of Dodger tradition, and we're obviously
tied to that,'' the Dodgers' Coons said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Danadio heads the Keep the Dodgers Committee for the Vero
Beach Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot more than just a team coming for spring
training once a year to Vero Beach,'' Danadio said of the
tradition. ``We feel strongly that with the amount of change going
on in the Dodgers organization, the one thing they have left is
Vero Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   That and the fact that Vero Beach doesn't want to lose an
estimated $30 million a year generated by the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Danadio said the city and county have made a proposal to the
Dodgers to buy the stadium, practice fields and conference center,
and then lease it back to the team for a minimal amount. The
Dodgers would keep the cash purchase price. The Dodgers are the
only major-league team to own its own complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more to lose than anyone else in spring training, so
we have to work a little harder,'' Danadio said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cactus League hopes to have a record attendance
year, but also has plenty to do without dwelling on luring new
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a more exciting time for the Cactus
League,'' said Jerry Geiger, president of the Cactus League
Association. ``We're coming off a terribly exciting, history-making
year for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Geiger and Robert Brinton, who heads the Mesa Visitors and
Convention Bureau, both say the Cactus League has a chance to hit
the 1-million mark in attendance for the first time. Last year's
attendance was about 890,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs pre-sold 119,000 tickets for this spring, while last
year's total attendance during March was 134,000. The team, which
regularly leads the Cactus League in attendance, would have to
average about 11,000 or so the rest of the month to break 1998's
157,000 record attendance. Brinton said it will be close, but
easily better than last year, when poor weather and a less
attractive schedule held attendance down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that we were heading into a better season _ thank you,
Sammy,'' Brinton said. ``It's more festive all the way around.''
</P>
<P>
   How big is the Cubs' slugger, who last year hit 66 home runs to
finish second to Mark McGwire's record-setting 70?
</P>
<P>
   Thursday in Tucson, the largest crowd ever to see a Cactus
League game in the city _ 11,808 _ turned out at Tucson Electric
Park to see the Cubs and the Arizona Diamondbacks. And Sosa didn't
even show.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams have seen a spike in preseason sales, too. The
Milwaukee Brewers report advance sales up 20 to 30 percent over
last year. And country singer Garth Brooks, back in camp Thursday
after spending five days with his mother, who had a cancerous spot
removed, is attracting bigger crowds to San Diego Padres games.
</P>
<P>
   Geiger said lousy weather at the beginning of last March kept
visitors away, and 60 percent of Cactus League attendance comes
from out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Brinton estimated that attendance so far is up about 10 percent
across the league.
</P>
<P>
   Scully, the county sports commissioner, said there is a lot of
work to do in marketing the league better. And he said the state
must work to maintain the Cactus League facilities at a high level
without money from the the rental-vehicle tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of excitement with the Dodgers,'' Baier said.
``It makes sense, but there are other challenges on the horizon
when we no longer have that (tax) money.''
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Baier said the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau had been
trying to woo teams _ including the Dodgers _ to train there.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Powers, a spokesman for the Las Vegas bureau, said its board
had shelved plans to build a spring training complex because it
wouldn't be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   But Powers said private efforts to build facilities could
surface. And Baier said the Dodgers have also talked to private
parties in Las Vegas about a complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, they certainly have the cash in Las Vegas,''
Baier said. ``It's possible they not only have the ability to build
those facilities but to cover all the teams' expenses and give the
teams a share of the revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Baier's worry is that Arizona will become complacent because the
Cactus League is in such good shape now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look into the future, when all these leases begin
expiring in eight to 15 years and the facilities will need
renovation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Arizona cities still want more baseball teams. One city is
Yuma, which nearly landed a minor-league affiliate for the
Diamondbacks and has a long history of baseball, including the
previous spring home of the San Diego Padres and the current spring
home of the Yakult Swallows of Japan's Central League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yuma is still very interested in having a team,'' Baier said.
``I view it as something that would be a goal. They have rabid
fans, and a facility in place. All it would take is renovations.''
</P>
<P>
   And Marana, which early on talked to the Dodgers, is definitely
interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to have four teams in Tucson, wouldn't it?''
Baier asked.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned. A new decade is about to begin.

NOBODY CAN FIND THE BASKET, EXCEPT DUKE 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ It was the region that couldn't shoot straight
Friday in a brutal afternoon of substandard basketball at the East
Regional of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament. None of the four teams competing shot better than 40
percent and one, Wisconsin, scored only 32 points. Then top-seeded
Duke showed up Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils rolled over Florida A&AMP;M, 99-58. In the first 10
minutes of the game, they showed why they are the tournament
favorite, matching Wisconsin's final point total. Duke went deep on
the bench to play the walk-ons well before the first-half buzzer
sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The overmatched Rattlers (12-19), from the Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference, played gallantly to stay within 4 points in the opening
four minutes. But then the Blue Devils (33-1) exploded for 23
straight points on their way to a 59-20 halftime lead behind 65.5
percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Duke obviously did not need Trajan Langdon, the fifth-year
senior and leading scorer, who has not played since spraining his
left foot in the quarterfinals of last week's Atlantic Coast
Conference tournament. Nor did the Blue Devils need Elton Brand,
who played just 19 minutes but led four Blue Devils in double
figures with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Taymon Domzalski, Duke's little-used big man at 6 feet 10
inches, added 13 points. Duke shot 61.8 percent from the field and
66.7 percent from the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously had more talent than them and should have won,''
said Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski. ``But they're a great story _ to
go 0-10 and 1-13 and then make the NCAA tournament. What a story!''
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers won their last five games to earn their first
tournament berth. ``It was a dream that we played against probably
the best college team ever assembled,'' said Kevin George, a senior
from Queens. ``It was an honor to be on the same court with them.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SOUTHWEST MISSOURI STATE 43, WISCONSIN 32
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The 12th-seeded Bears, coached by Steve Alford, upset the
fifth-seeded Badgers in a game filled with missed shots.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin (22-10) was 12 of 47 from the field (25.5 percent),
including six minutes without scoring in the second half, to insure
its place in the record book. The Badgers scored the fewest points
in an NCAA tournament game since the advent of the shot clock in
1986 and the fewest in any NCAA tournament game since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the Bears will play Tennessee, which defeated
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dick Bennett of Wisconsin knew his team entered the
tournament struggling to score. It had been bounced from the Big
Ten tournament by Michigan State after a 10-minute stretch without
a basket. But he said he felt helpless Friday as he watched the
Badgers, who were 2 of 16 from behind the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   ``They locked onto our cuts, and inside we weren't physical
enough,'' said Bennett, whose team runs a deliberate, cut-and-shoot
offense.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE 62, DELAWARE 52
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tennessee's victory over Delaware was also numbing to watch.
After the number of air balls reached double digits and the
turnovers slowed the game to shuffleboard pace, the Tennessee
Volunteers decided that if somebody had to win this game, it might
as well be them. They did it in pitiful fashion, beating the Blue
Hens in one of the most poorly played games in NCAA tournament
history.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams were a combined 38 for 118 from the field, lost
the ball 33 times and looked like recreation league teams as they
stepped out of bounds, fought their teammates for rebounds and
missed layups. The fourth-seeded Volunteers (21-8) shot 29.8
percent; the 13th-seeded Blue Hens (25-6) shot 32.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the second half, the lights inside the Charlotte
Coliseum were brightened, prompting Tennessee guard Brandon Wharton
to joke afterward, ``It was probably a horrible game to watch so
they had to put the spotlight on the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Hens had a 6-point lead with 7 minutes 31 seconds to go
in the first half, but the Volunteers mounted a 16-7 run to take a
25-22 lead into the locker room. Delaware, despite 23 points from
forward Mike Pegues, pulled within 3 points with 11 minutes left in
the game, then watched the Vols score 13 of the next 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware was held to its lowest point total of the year.

THE KNICKS JUST ABOUT HIT AN ALL-TIME FRANCHISE LOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Knicks had been able to camouflage their character
flaws, hide their casual attitude and cardboard pride. They had
been able to keep their dark secret to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's out. The stripped-down Chicago Bulls revealed the
soul-less underbelly of a Knicks franchise Friday night that barely
displayed any pride and effort in a 76-63 defeat at the United
Center that brushed against the team's all-time lows.
</P>
<P>
   Only a meaningless lay-in by Marcus Camby with 22.9 seconds left
prevented the Knicks from tying the team's all-time low for points
in a game _ 61, set on March 22, 1992, in a game against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   And before garbage time set in the fourth quarter, the Knicks,
who had just 33 points after three quarters, were clearly on the
verge of sinking beneath the league's all-time low offensive mark
for a regular-season game. That figure, 55 points, was set by
Indiana a year ago in a game against San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Knicks did manage to set a franchise low for points
with 22 in the first half, and tied another team mark by scoring
just 5 points in the second quarter (the previous 5 came in a game
against Portland two years ago). By the miserable end, the Knicks
(11-9) had turned the ball over 23 times and shot just 31 percent
and their 19 field goals had also tied an all-time NBA low.
</P>
<P>
   Stars like Allan Houston, Larry Johnson and Latrell Sprewell
were of no help. The Bulls (6-14) led by as many as 32 in the third
quarter as the Knicks staggered to their sixth loss in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   This was not about missing the injured Patrick Ewing. This was
deeper than that. After all, this was not exactly the championship
Bulls of old they were facing. And this was not the third night of
three consecutive nights in this crammed season, either. This was a
simple back-to-back game against a shell of a championship team.
</P>
<P>
   And the Knicks simply failed to show up. Even worse, they did
not seem to care. They were blank-faced as they absorbed this
near-historic humiliation. They did not pound their fists or yell
at the skies or scream at each other. Without the slightest
emotion, the Knicks just surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   There were times when Coach Jeff Van Gundy just stood on the
sideline, hands on hips, with a look of disgust flooding his tired
face. He was motionless, stunned. Not to this unthinkable degree,
but Van Gundy had almost predicted this kind of mental collapse
before the game. He had been worried about the team's attitude,
about the casual way they accepted losing just as long as they
still kept their heads about .500.
</P>
<P>
   `'We're stuck in a little mediocrity,'' said Van Gundy. `'I want
the six guys who have been here before to pull us out of it. I just
have the feeling that we're too accepting of mediocrity.''
</P>
<P>
   But mediocrity did not begin to describe the lifeless approach
the Knicks had as they spent four quarters setting, or nearly
setting, all sorts of all-time lows. It was almost surreal. As
quick as a blunder, the Knicks were down, 20-2, in the first
quarter before they scrambled to pull within 29-17. And to think,
the real unraveling was only about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   In the franchise-tying 5-point second quarter, the Knicks missed
their last nine shots before the break, made just one of 13 field
goals and turned the ball over seven times. By the end of their
franchise-low 22-point first half _ the likes of which had not been
seen since the Knicks title team of 1973 scored just 26 against the
Bulls at Chicago Stadium on Feb. 23, 1973 _ the team had turned the
ball over 15 times and hit just 7 of 27 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, the league's lowest scoring team, were making a
mockery of the Knicks' celebrated defense. Toni Kukoc, who had been
10 for 41 in the two previous meetings with the Knicks this season,
finished the first half 6 for 9 and 4 for 4 from 3-point range. His
20 first-half points were collected as he popped free of Johnson,
Sprewell, Camby and any other plodding Knick that Van Gundy wanted
to throw at him.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls didn't have to be great. They didn't have to have
Michael Jordan. All they needed was to capitalize on the
half-hearted Knicks to build a lead that bulged at 25 points during
the second quarter. There was little Van Gundy could do. Timeouts
didn't help, pulling Kurt Thomas or Chris Dudley or Houston or
Johnson didn't help, either.
</P>
<P>
   This spinout was beyond his control. Every player he had come to
rely on without Ewing was letting the team down. In the first half,
Johnson was 1 for 5, Houston was 1 for 6 and Sprewell was 2 for 9.
It was Sprewell who scored all 5 points in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' second quarter made the first one something to brag
about, even though it was nearly as miserable. At the start, Kukoc
lost Johnson to hit two consecutive 3-pointers in concert with a
Bulls team that was feeling dizzy with their lead. The Bulls hit
their first six shots of the game at the same time the Knicks were
committing five turnovers in the first four minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing to be said that the scoreboard didn't already
indicate.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Ward, who had ice on his sore right shoulder before the
game, took a spill in the opening minute. He played 5 minutes,
turned the ball over once and then left the game with a bruised
right shoulder and did not return.

MIAMI OF OHIO LEADER SCORES 43 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending to correct slugline)  
 (ATTN: Wash., N.Y., Utah, Ark.)  (mk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Chagrined by his losing performance in the
Mid-American Conference tournament final, Miami of Ohio's Wally
Szczerbiak came into the Midwest Regional looking to get the sour
taste out of his mouth. He did so by keeping the basketball in his
own hands.
</P>
<P>
   The senior forward from Long Island, N.Y., scored a career-high
43 points in the Red Hawks' 59-58 victory over Washington Friday in
the Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   Tenth-seeded Miami now faces No. 2 Utah on Sunday in a
second-round game. The Utes (28-4) steamrolled past Arkansas State,
80-53, for their 23rd consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak, who played with a dislocated kneecap during the
conference final, may now be fighting arm soreness. He launched 33
of Miami's 55 shots, making 18 of them. He had 12 rebounds to lead
both teams. He played all but 33 seconds in the game. He hit the
game-winning shot. And he blocked what could have been the Huskies'
game-winner in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps as surprising as Szczerbiak's dominance was how
little special attention the seventh-seeded Huskies gave him
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the MAC, guys are always hedging on screens, chasing me up
and down the floor and bodying me up,'' he said. ``I was more open
than I've ever been today.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington coach Bob Bender agreed that his team did a miserable
job of getting around the screens Szczerbiak's teammates kept
setting for him. ``And once he got his confidence, he was that much
tougher to stop,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Donald Watts said the Huskies had seen a number of guys
with Szczerbiak's offensive ability, but he lamented that they
could not keep him from finding a comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you let a player of that caliber get into his comfort
zone, he'll burn you,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Szczerbiak, a 6-foot-8-inch, 243-pound senior
forward, noted that he had a number of shots rattle in and out or
he might have exceeded the 54 points he once scored at Cold Spring
Harbor High School in Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak missed 13 of 17 shots in a painful 6-point loss to
Kent in the conference final, hampered by the kneecap. But on
Friday the points came early and often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the games I can keep up with how many points I have,''
he said. ``Today, I had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, which ended its season at 17-12, stayed with a
box-and-one defense through much of the game, with Greg Clark
mostly assigned to Szczerbiak. Szczerbiak said he realized early on
that the Huskies' 7-foot center, Todd MacCulloch, would not be much
of a shot-blocking presence.

   By halftime, Szczerbiak had 21 points as 10th-seeded Miami, now
23-7, built a 29-26 lead. He scored the Red Hawks' winning basket
with 1 minute 10 seconds left, then made the crucial defensive stop
as time was running out. He blocked Clark's jump shot with three
seconds left, retrieved the ball, then threw the ball high in the
air after the game clock reached zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony Taylor did a great job of switching off and forcing
Watts to give the ball up to my man,'' Szczerbiak said. ``I knew
time was running down and I closed out. I didn't want to foul. I
stuck my hand up, got a piece of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And because of it, the Red Hawks live to play another day. But
they may not last much longer.

<P>
   UTAH 80, ARKANSAS STATE 53
</P>
<P>
   The opener essentially pitted a polished team against an
unpolished one. Utah, runner-up to Kentucky last year, fielded a
starting lineup of 22-year-olds except for the 20-year-old guard
Jeremy Killion. Arkansas State (18-12) may well have had an edge in
athleticism, but began to show chinks after taking a 15-7 lead 6:45
into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out intense and we didn't match them,'' Utah forward
Alex Jensen said. ``When we matched their intensity in the second
half, we were able to pull away.''
</P>
<P>
   A 40-24 rebounding edge didn't hurt, either.

   For 21 years Laura Shaw worked as an insurance claims processor
for New England Financial, leading what looked to co-workers like a
quiet life on a modest salary. No one would have pegged her as a
candidate for the 20-count indictment handed up by a federal grand
jury March 2 or as the mastermind behind a computer scam that
allegedly siphoned $3.3 million from her company.
</P>
<P>
   She apparently did it for the love of horses _ not bets at the
track, but the buying and training of American saddlebreds for
show. Colleagues at New England Financial knew of her hobby from
the horse photographs on her desk but had no idea how deep this
passion went or that it might have led her down the twisted path of
what now seems to have been a double life.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's story makes a person wonder about the illusions of the
office and whether one can ever really know the man or woman in the
next cubicle. We think we know these co-workers of many years,
chit-chat with them at lunch, and even share confidences under the
umbrella of a corporate camaraderie that makes them seem pretty
much like us, give or take a few personality quirks.
</P>
<P>
   But how many Walter Mitty fantasies percolate behind a pair of
bifocals seemingly intent on the latest policy memo? How many of
those fantasies inch into reality as the placid accountant tries to
write a spy novel during lunch hours or the married-with-family
president calls his tootsie?
</P>
<P>
   When word of criminal behavior surfaces in these incubators of
conformity, the incongruity is almost paralyzing, for such
aberrations seem impossible amid the rules, security, and attention
to detail that weave the cocoon of company life.
</P>
<P>
   The press arrives and asks: Who was this renegade disguised as a
bureaucrat? Did anyone suspect? If the crime is a violent one, then
surely there must have been signs. But co-workers can often recall
nothing more than the pleasant smile of a prompt and courteous
employee.
</P>
<P>
   Thoreau once observed that people lead lives of quiet
desperation _ probably because they're invisible.

HOUSE IMPROVEMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be hard to imagine a more pressing time for members of
the US House of Representatives to promote civility among their
peers. The impeachment of President Clinton strained already frayed
relations between Democrats and Republicans and exacerbated raw
divisons within the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   So a House retreat planned in Hershey, Penn., starting next
Friday deserves applause. Whether it has a hope of success is
another matter.
</P>
<P>
   A similar retreat was held two years ago. Less than a month
later two House leaders _ Republican whip Tom DeLay and Democrat
David Obey _ were involved in a shoving-and-cussing incident on the
House floor that embarrassed all of Congress. Highly partisan
wrangling on legislative issues and then the impeachment drama
added to an unusually rancorous session.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Thomas Sawyer, an Ohio Democrat and one of the
retreat's organizers, says optimistically that even the DeLay-Obey
dust-up had positive consequences, because many members rushed to
restore order. Another organizer, Illinois Republican Ray LaHood,
says most Democrats and Republicans agree that bipartisanship is
needed on at least a few issues to prove that the House is not
stuck in endless acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   So the organizers have invited Nobel Peace Prize laureate John
Hume to set an example. The theory is that members who come to know
one another as three-dimensional people rather than one-dimensional
issue positions will be able to make the compromises bipartisanship
requires.
</P>
<P>
   Two problems remain. One is that some congressmen are in fact
one-dimensional, at least in their politics. And another was noted
by organizer Amo Houghton, a New York Republican: While about half
the House will attend, the absentees will include many of those
``who need it the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, credit is due those determined to see that the retreat's
success is measured not simply in keeping physical assaults to a
minimum but in achieving bipartisan progress. That would merit
another peace prize.

<P>
   When 40 state attorneys general sued the tobacco industry to
recover Medicaid costs associated with smoking-related illnesses,
the federal government declined an invitation to join. When the
historic $386 billion tobacco settlement arrived in Congress for
ratification in 1996, lawmakers dithered, delayed, and disgraced
the bill by loading it with unrelated giveaways, then killed it on
the grounds that it was too expensive. The federal government,
including the Clinton administration, does not deserve its claim on
the $246 billion the states negotiated later with the cigarette
companies, even though Washington picks up about 57 cents of every
Medicaid dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the states are not bound to use the money as
the AGs intended _ to fund programs aimed at reducing smoking,
especially among young people, so the escalating cycle of disease
can be broken. Some have plans for the money that include highway
and prison projects not even tangentially related to the public
health. In Massachusetts, Governor &UR;  &LR; Paul Cellucci has proposed
using the state's initial share of the settlement _ $361 million _
for AIDS initiatives, insurance coverage, and other laudable
purposes, but with none of the money going to the state's highly
successful tobacco control program.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Martin Meehan, a leader in the congressional
fight against big tobacco, has proposed legislation that would
require all states to devote at least 25 percent of the settlement
cash to antismoking programs as a condition for Washington waiving
its claim. The Senate recently adopted language waiving the claim
without any conditions, which leaves the door open to mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Although some in Washington have excellent ideas for using the
settlement money, including better enforcement by the Food and Drug
Administration and a national advertising campaign, those should be
funded through general revenues. Meehan's proposal is an
appropriate compromise between squandering an opportunity to reduce
smoking and dictating how the states should spend the cash they
worked so hard to earn.

SCHROEDER IN COMMAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oskar Lafontaine, the German finance minister, did not deserve
the label ``most dangerous man in Europe'' (bestowed by a London
tabloid), but his resignation lifts a burden from Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder. Six months after he first took office, Schroeder
has gained unquestioned control of the German government.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine is described as a Keynesian for believing that an
increase in consumer demand is necessary to revive the German
economy. John Maynard Keynes, the late British economist, was
prescribing remedies for the Great Depression. He would no doubt be
concerned about the 11 percent German unemployment rate today, but
he might also have noted that mandatory social service
contributions add 42 percent to already high German wages. Foreign
companies rarely invest there, preferring Ireland or Britain for
lower taxes and fewer regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The European financial establishment disliked Lafontaine so much
that a cut in interest rates, one of his better ideas, was unlikely
as long as he was in office. He was especially feared because as
chairman of the Social Democratic Party, his power base extended
beyond the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has consolidated his power by becoming party chairman,
and he replaced Lafontaine with a technocrat. For the rest of his
term, economic policy will be the chancellor's ultimate
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has gained great popularity by saying little about his
economic views. He seems to be a disciple of Tony Blair, the
British prime minister, who is trying to chart a middle way between
dogmatic socialism and untrammeled capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has one great advantage over his German counterpart.
Margaret Thatcher, as inflexible in her own way as Lafontaine, did
much to cut away obsolete regulations and subsidies in the '80s to
prepare Britain for international economic competition. Schroeder
faces the formidable task of finding a distinctly German approach
that revamps the economy while preserving programs that protect the
vulnerable from the cruelties of capitalism.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the fight against domestic violence, the lyrics of rap songs
can be a slippery enemy but one that deserves to be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Cloaked in free speech rights, some songs slash at women. The
white rapper Eminem is one example. He has earned respect and a
recording contract from the black rap community. He might have
something to say about being white in a black world. But his new
release, ``The Slim Shady LP,'' includes the lowdown on a father
hiding mom's body in the trunk and not quite admitting this to his
child. This prompted Timothy White, editor in chief of Billboard
magazine, to write a column criticizing Eminem for taking a
``leadership role in making money by exploiting the world's
misery.''
</P>
<P>
   But calling one song ``delightfully mean-spirited,'' critic
Brian McCollum of the Detroit Free Press says the CD is part of an
entertainment tradition, ``the wink-and-nod allure of horror film
violence.'' Others rightly argue that rap is an art that braves
some of life's darkest corners.
</P>
<P>
   Those who condemn rap's attacks on women risk sounding racist or
like the prudes who wanted Elvis's swiveling hips kept off
television. Eminem and other performers' robust use of free speech
deserves an equal and opposing reaction. It's too long a leap to
say that lyrics will make listeners act violently. But it's
essential to ask what daily decay comes from fans mouthing lines
about drugging and raping a girl or assaulting a television star.
</P>
<P>
   Portrayed as making a lot of money, rap singers have dangerous
clout, argues Kate Cloud of Respond Inc., a nonprofit organization
in Boston that serves battered women and children. Respond benefits
from sales of a CD that includes the work of local musicians.
</P>
<P>
   This presents a challenge to other artists: Pick worthy
adversaries. Rap has the raw power to expose violence instead of
glorifying it, to show the child who sees his mother's murder, to
dissect what turns people against those they know.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has a right _ which must be vigilantly defended _ to
trot out tired, brutal cliches. The world is hungry for artists who
can do more.

WATER PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, March 14, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans take water for granted. They expend enormous
quantities of it to wash their cars, sprinkle their lawns, and
irrigate their fields. Only when passing through Death Valley or
some other arid sector of the Southwest might the average
water-spoiled American be inclined to imagine fresh water as a
disappearing natural resource, an economic threat, or a cause of
war.
</P>
<P>
   But in many parts of the world these are the perils of water
scarcity. For people in the Middle East, for people living near the
Nile or in the Fertile Crescent formed by the Tigris and Euphrates,
for the 1.2 billion people of China, the need for fresh water
presages conflict and crisis in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
   The former secretary general of the United Nations, Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, predicted when he was Egypt's foreign minister that
``the next war in our region will be over the waters of the Nile,
not politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's situation as a country dependent on the good will of its
riparian neighbors is a classic example of the dangers that finite
supplies of fresh water present. Egyptians have always been
sustained by the waters of the Nile _ but there are nine countries
upstream of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 Egypt and Sudan signed the Nile Treaty, which has served
fairly well as a basis for the equitable sharing of Nile waters.
But as Ethiopia begins to divert water from the Nile for a
burgeoning population, the two countries risk coming into conflict
over a resource as indispensable as air.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the bitter disputes to be unknotted in final-status
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, none
promises to be more difficult than the quarrel over water rights. A
recent international study establishing the facts and parameters of
the water problem in the land between Jordan's eastern border and
the Mediterranean coast of Israel warned that even with competent
management of water resources, ``the area's inhabitants will almost
assuredly live under conditions of significant water stress in the
near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, routinely denied permission to dig wells in the
West Bank, aspire to gain control over the West Bank aquifer, which
Israel can hardly do without. On the Israeli side there is
trepidation that once the West Bank is ceded to the Palestinians,
improvident water management might doom both peoples to the
irreparable loss of the pristine water in their sole aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mideast as elsewhere, the perils of scarce water are
compounded by a blatant contradiction. Although freshwater sources
often extend or flow across borders, there is no international or
supranational legal framework like the Law of the Sea to guide the
apportioning of water rights. Each conflict over water must be
addressed in an ad hoc way through binational or regional
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   There is a further contradiction in the legal principles
governing the water laws that do exist. On the one hand, a given
country may assume it has a right to do whatever it wishes with all
the water in its territory, even if that water flows to it across a
border. On the other hand, one country's right to dam up or divert
its water implies that it has a right to reduce the amount of water
flowing to a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic illustration of the dangers inherent in conflicts
over water rights can be seen in Turkey's elaborate and expensive
damming of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The 22 dams and 19
hydroelectric plants being built on the two rivers are in the
southeast, the Kurdish region of Turkey. The enormous value
Turkey's $32 billion dam project is expected to have in the next
century has a lot to do with Ankara's zealous repression of almost
all Kurdish political activity.
</P>
<P>
   And damming the Tigris and Euphrates has provoked tensions in
relations with Turkey's neighbors Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Since there are no affordable technological fixes for the
world's looming water crisis _ desalination being too costly for
poor countries and transportation of water remaining impractical _
the realistic palliatives for the foreseeable future must be
conservation, cooperation among states, and population control.
None of these remedies will be easy to administer, but the world
has no choice in the matter. There is no life without water.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, which Lyndon Johnson
used as an ersatz authorization for America's undeclared war in
Vietnam, the legislative and executive branches have feuded over
their respective roles in taking the always grave decision to place
US troops in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   This week that quarrel reached a boiling point. The most telling
sign that Congress is abandoning a tradition that partisanship
should cease at the water's edge was the premature House vote on
the Clinton administration's plan to include 4,000 US soldiers
among 28,000 NATO peacekeepers who will go to Kosovo in the event
that the Serb and Albanian sides sign a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The administration properly implored the House not to take its
nonbinding vote until after the belligerents signed onto the peace
agreement. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned that the
House's ill-timed consideration of the issue could abort precarious
negotiations that are at a crucial stage and ``be taken by both
sides as a green light to resume fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   The same brief was reinforced at House hearings by former Senate
majority leader Bob Dole and Jeane Kirkpatrick, Ronald Reagan's
ambassador to the United Nations. Both said it is very much in
America's interest to put out the Kosovo fire before it flares up
into a regional conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 219 to 191 Thursday to authorize the deployment
of US troops, irresponsibly refusing to wait for a peace accord to
be signed.
</P>
<P>
   Congress certainly has a right to demand consultation in
decisions that can result in American casualties. It was in the
name of that right that Barney Frank became the only liberal
Democrat to vote for a resolution against sending troops to Kosovo.
The resolution, proposed by Republican Tillie Fowler of Florida,
was defeated, but any legislator who remembered the Gulf of Tonkin
deception could be excused for supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the only conceivable reason for holding the House vote
this week, when it might imperil the Kosovo peace negotiations, was
intemperate partisanship. The Republican leadership should not
allow itself to be blinded in this way again.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Crayola should keep ``indian red'' in the box and spell it with
a capital I. The color, introduced in 1958 and printed in lowercase
because the crayon manufacturer heard that children have trouble
reading capital letters, is being renamed because of teacher
complaints that it ``confuses'' children who think it refers to the
skin pigment of Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It has nothing to do with Native Americans _ the reddish brown
tint is named for a pigment found in soil around India and used to
make fine oil paints. A simple explanation and pointer to a map
would clear up any confusion, just as a quick grammar lesson would
explain that proper nouns begin with capital letters. There would
also be room for a lesson in respect for human beings of all ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   But a chance at education suffers because of hypersensitivity to
the possibility that someone might be offended, however mistakenly,
and because adults feel they must dilute fascinating concepts that
students might find too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the fate of Crayola's ``prussian blue'' (again spelled
incorrectly), eliminated in 1958 because of complaints that
children couldn't relate to Prussia, which was no longer on the
map.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Empire isn't on the map, either, but good teaching
always makes it relevant. The same is true of ancient Greece.
Likewise, many a young mind might have been prompted to find out
about the former German state and its rigid military life while
musing over a crayon named for the uniforms worn by Prussian
soldiers. The replacement name, ``midnight blue,'' has probably
never sent a child to the encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   Crayola did make the right move when it changed ``flesh'' to
``peach'' in 1962, acknowledging that skin comes in many hues. But
bending to misplaced pressure for the wrong reasons cheapens the
stand for a valid cause.
</P>
<P>
   The job of anyone connected with the education of children
should be to teach them to think. Eliminating ``indian red''
teaches them to duck the truth and take the easy way out.

   John MacLean sounded as if he were describing a fireworks
display.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just boom, boom,'' MacLean said. ``It's just bang, bang,
bang.''
</P>
<P>
   MacLean, a Rangers right wing, accounted for some of the
pyrotechnics Friday night at Madison Square Garden when he scored
twice to give the Rangers two of their three one-goal leads in the
third period against the Boston Bruins. But Anson Carter of the
Bruins answered with the final two rocket bursts, 19 seconds apart
with less than three minutes remaining, to give the Bruins a 5-4
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The result was significant in the Eastern Conference playoff
race because it left the Rangers 4 points behind the eighth-place
Bruins for the final post-season berth. The Rangers are in 10th
place, 1 point behind Florida, and with 16 games to go in the
regular season, the Rangers have played one more game than both
Boston and Florida.

the Bruins _ played well for two periods, but both wore down under
the barrage of the shooting gallery. The game was tied at 1-1 at
the second intermission, then exploded with seven goals in a third
period that the old-time hockey coaches used to call
rambly-scrambly and loosey-goosey.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers finished with 44 shots and the Bruins with 38.
Carter's winning goal, which was unassisted, came at 17 minutes 32
seconds of the third period after several Rangers, including
Richter, had trouble handling the puck in their end.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a little sloppy down low,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, watching from the other end, thought his team was lucky
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, we got away with one,'' he said. ``The way we were
playing, we didn't deserve to win that game. That's a 4-point game.
It's a pretty devastating loss for the Rangers. I don't know what
that does for their psyche going into the stretch run.''
</P>
<P>
   That run continues Sunday on Long Island against the Islanders.
Richter, who has played in the last 10 games, said his team would
refocus, although he added: ``It's not like you deceive yourself
and say it doesn't matter that we lost.'' He stressed that the team
still has 16 games remaining to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Heinze also scored two goals for the Bruins and Jason
Allison got the other, the only power-play goal of the night.
MacLean's two goals give him 25 with the Rangers. Adam Graves, who
has 32 for the season and a new contract on the way, got one of the
other Ranger goals, with another scored by Mike Knuble. Petr Nedved
had 2 assists and 11 shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   John Muckler, the Rangers' coach, spoke soothing words
afterward, saying, ``Oh, I guess it's a breakdown, it's bad luck,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a different tone than he displayed in the first period,
when his team fell behind by 1-0 and almost by 2-0 until a Boston
goal was disallowed after a video review showed a man in the
crease.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Muckler called a timeout to scold his players on
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a little bit rattled and we just tried to calm
everybody down,'' Muckler said. The coach said the game was ``a
learning experience'' for some of the Rangers, particularly their
young players. Manny Malhotra, the rookie center, set up Knuble's
goal and put four shots on net. But he was on the ice for the
winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not from a lack of trying,'' Muckler said of the defeat,
referring to the team in general. ``We did some not-very-good
things in behind the blue line, there's no question about that. But
those things are going to happen. You can't dwell on it. We lost,
we're four points behind, and we're going to Long Island. We've got
to get over it. We're not out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   His players seemed calm enough afterward, some even upbeat.
Brian Leetch, the captain, said: ``It was some hockey game.
Obviously, it was disappointing for us at the end, but it was an
exciting game to play in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got two of their veteran defensemen back from
injuries. Ulf Samuelsson had missed two games with a concussion,
and Peter Popovic had not played in a month because of blood in his
right eye. The Rangers also used Mike Maneluk, a forward acquired
from Chicago on waivers on March 4. Maneluk had dressed for one
game, last Sunday in Boston, but did not play.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   RICK CURRAN, agent for ADAM GRAVES, said it would be ``just a
matter of days'' before the Rangers announce a new multiyear
contract for the veteran left wing. Graves, who has 32 goals this
season, will be 31 this summer. Without a contract, he could become
an unrestricted free agent. He makes $3 million this season and
stands to earn more on his next deal. ``Things are almost done,''
Curran said. ``I'm optimistic.'' Graves said after the game
``Hopefully, it will get done.'' He said he was more focused these
days on hockey and his newborn daughter, MONTANA, and her older
sister, MADISON. ... Other Rangers who could become unrestricted
free agents this summer are the defensemen BRIAN LEETCH and ULF
SAMUELSSON. Although Leetch's agent has discussed a new pact with
the General Manager NEIL SMITH, there has been no indication of
momentum from either side. Samuelsson said recently that he had had
no negotiations. The trade deadline is March 23. . . . Still
injured for the Rangers are forward TODD HARVEY and defenseman JEFF
BEUKEBOOM. Harvey has a broken right thumb and Beukeboom is
recovering from a concussion. Harvey will be back in about two
weeks. Beukeboom's return is indefinite. . .. Out of uniform Friday
night were defensemen STAN NECKAR and RICH BRENNAN.  &QL;

<P>
   Does it take a law _ that is, pesky government intervention _ to
protect consumers who use the Internet? The issue flared recently
when Richard Smith, president of a Cambridge, Mass., software
company, made a troubling, Big Brother discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Smith found that Microsoft's Windows 98 on some computer systems
_ mostly networked computers and not home PCs _ generates
identification numbers. Without customers' consent, these numbers
were transmitted to Microsoft and could in theory have been used as
tracking devices.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bug, Microsoft said of the problem, and it is being
cleared up. The numbers were meant only to provide information to
speed up phone calls made by customers seeking product support.
</P>
<P>
   But on-line privacy is more than a one-glitch issue. In another
case, US Representative Edward Markey of Massachusetts charged in a
letter to the Intel Corp. that its Pentium III chips could violate
consumers' privacy by creating a way to track their Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Self-regulate, says the Online Privacy Alliance, a
coalition of more than 80 corporations and associations, including
Microsoft and Intel. The alliance suggests that Web page sponsors
post their privacy policies and earn a privacy seal of approval
from independent organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure should help. But there still ought to be a law _ a
legal standard that protects consumers without strangling industry.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
last year, protecting those who are 12 years old or younger. This
year Markey is drafting legislation to cover adults. Three
provisions _ summed up as knowledge, notice, and no _ would give
consumers knowledge about what information is collected about them;
notice of how the information would be used; and the ability to say
no to the taking of their information. In Europe, a Markey aide
says, privacy rules are stricter because of awareness that data as
basic as someone's religion could be used harmfully.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation died in the last two Congresses. That's a
shame. Whether on the street or the Internet, people are entitled
to privacy.

RANGERS, GONZALEZ'S AGENTS TO TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The Texas Rangers will receive their
first indication Saturday of how difficult it will be to keep Juan
Gonzalez in a Texas uniform beyond the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers president Tom Schieffer plans to begin discussions with
Gonzalez's representatives, Jim Bronner and Fernando Cuza,
regarding a contract extension for the two-time American League
most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Two issues likely will be addressed when the parties convene:
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's existing contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' commitment toward retaining their right fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we want Juan to play for us, but I don't think this
is just a real big deal (Saturday)'' Schieffer said. ``Juan is
under a long-term contract now. Obviously, we've been able to work
out a long-term contract with him in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both sides know each other a lot better now than they
did five years ago, so I don't think there's going to be any
particular problem working something out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez declined to discuss the matter and said he remains
committed solely to ``staying focused on baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's existing contract will pay him $8.5 million this
season and $7.5 million the next should the Rangers exercise their
option for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Gonzalez well below the game's best-paid position
player. That distinction belongs to first baseman Mo Vaughn, who
received a six-year contract worth $80 million ($13.33 million per
year) this winter from the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   To what lengths will the Rangers be willing to go?
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez could command more than Vaughn received and threaten
the level attained by pitcher Kevin Brown, who became the game's
best-paid player after signing a seven-year contract worth $105
million _ or $15 million annually _ with the Los Angeles Dodgers
this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the sort of guy who has to have a dollar more than
somebody else,'' Schieffer said of Gonzalez. ``He makes a lot of
money, but I really don't think money is the motivating factor for
Juan. I don't think he really measures his self-worth by how much
money he makes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to be well-compensated. He wants to be compensated as
well as someone else in his position, as well he should be. I don't
have any problem with that, but he traditionally has not been very
difficult to deal with on salary matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Players Association encourages its marquee members to test
the market through free agency and thereby establish new salary
levels. Gonzalez and Seattle center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. could
become free agents after the 2000 season, and some major-league
officials speculate that one or both could command a contract worth
as much as $20 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone is going to put pressure on Juan
Gonzalez,'' Schieffer said. ``Juan Gonzalez has shown a pretty good
ability to take care of his own business. I think he's going to do
what he feels is in his best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado right fielder Larry Walker, whom Bronner also
represents, recently signed a six-year contract extension worth $75
million. Walker perhaps hurt his chances of earning more by taking
an active role during the negotiations against Bronner's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just do it,'' Walker said before signing. ``There's
certain money on the table, and I'm fine with it.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Rafael Palmeiro, who this winter signed a
five-year contract worth $45 million, likely accepted less to
return to the Rangers and also accepted $1 million per year
deferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may decide he wants to wait a year,'' Schieffer said of
Gonzalez. ``We may decide we want to wait a year. The nice thing
about it is we've basically got two years to come up with
something, but I really don't expect this to be a difficult
negotiation at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, no one should expect a swift resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wouldn't expect any final agreement to come out of
(Saturday),'' Schieffer said. ``It's just the beginning of the
process.'' nn

MAVERICKS GO BIG TO CONTROL BOARDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Leave it to the NBA's resident iron man to explain why
the Mavericks are suddenly attacking the backboards with a
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a conscious effort to go out and do our jobs,''
forward A.C. Green said of a 49-37 rebounding advantage over the
Orlando Magic on Thursday. ``We've been so lackadaisical in trying
to let the game come to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We challenged ourselves, as being men and as being
professionals, to really come and play as hard and as strong as you
possibly could. We've been extremely passive on defense, and the
energy hasn't been there.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly wasn't the case against Orlando, as the
Mavericks' front line of Green, Gary Trent and Shawn Bradley
dominated the glass. Green collected 13 points and 11 rebounds,
Trent had 21 points and 10 boards and Bradley added 10 points and
10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The front line epitomized the hard-hat effort Dallas (7-14)
hopes to take against the Vancouver Grizzlies (4-16) at 7 p.m.
Saturday at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coaches said an aggressive attitude by the front line
makes the rebounding pendulum swing Dallas' way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of the success with rebounding comes with A.C. at
the (small forward) spot, so we should outrebound most teams,''
Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson said. ``But I think more
than anything it's just become the focus of our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we've rebounded well we've seemed to come up with
wins. The guys understand what kind of priority it is and they're
taking it to task.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' big lineup of the 7-foot-6 Bradley, the 6-9 Green
and the 6-8 Trent came after 6-7 Cedric Ceballos, the starting
small forward, fractured both wrists.
</P>
<P>
   Trent, Green and Bradley focus on rebounding, an aspect of the
game that keeps teams in games when their jump shots desert them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've been committed every night to rebounding, it's
just some nights you can get there and some nights you can't,''
Trent said. ``Every night everybody wants to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just some nights you're maybe not mentally focused into
attacking the glass like you are at times. But the more consistency
you have with it, the more success you have with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who averages 3.57 blocks while shooting .527 from the
floor, likes the front-liners' cerebral approach: They go into
games knowing that no rebounds equals no victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to see us go out and attack the basket like we
did'' Thursday, Bradley said. ``If we keep doing that, I think
everything's going to be all right with this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Green, who will play his 1,000th consecutive game
Saturday, has been the ringleader on the boards, attacking early
and often. Green collected eight rebounds against Orlando in the
first half, and his spirited play has been infectious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been a guy like A.C. starting the rebounding
surge, and then Gary picking up on it, and then Shawn,'' Nelson
said. ``It's like anything else _ if it's successful, guys become
accustomed to doing it and it catches on like wildfire, and that's
what's been going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your offense is not clicking, you've got to find
different ways to generate offense. For us, it has been our
defensive and offensive rebounding that has paved the way.'' nn

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hoping to capitalize on their modest success in
stabilizing world oil prices, a coalition of major oil producers
announced Friday that they had agreed to cut production by another
2 million barrels a day, a move that kept crude oil prices heading
upward.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predicted that if the cuts were implemented as
promised by April 1, and if nascent signs of an economic recovery
in Asia were realized, a steady recovery of crude oil prices could
be in the offing. That would eventually bring higher gasoline
prices, which are now at very low levels.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the supply cuts held, which is far from certain, the
increase at the pump would be modest at first _ about 5 cents a
gallon, analysts said. Considering that gasoline prices have been
averaging about 95 cents a gallon for regular unleaded compared
with $1.06 a gallon last March, it will cause little pain in the
pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not kick off a wave of inflation,'' said Fred
Leuffer, an oil analyst for Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. ``It will not kill
the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on cuts was made at The Hague, Netherlands, by an
informal coalition that included Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Iran and
Venezuela, all members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, as well as Mexico, which is not an OPEC member. Formed
last March, the coalition of producers, which have all lost
billions in revenues because of the oil glut, has already managed
substantial production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   By presenting a unified front, the countries have minimized the
traditional undercutting of OPEC's attempts to raise prices. That
helped to boost prices until last summer, when the Asian economic
crisis cut demand for oil and brought prices down. The inability of
OPEC to make cuts last November further depressed prices, leading
to a 12-year low of $10.35 a barrel in December.
</P>
<P>
   For the new cutback to go into effect, it must be ratified and
spelled out in detail at an OPEC meeting in Vienna, Austria, on
March 23, agreed upon by non-OPEC producers, and then acted upon.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed cut represents about 2.6 percent of the daily world
demand of about 75 million barrels a day. News of the agreement
sent crude oil prices up 1.3 percent Friday, and 9 percent for the
week.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC failed to reach an agreement on production cuts at its most
recent meeting in November, and voluntary cutbacks in oil
production have been difficult to enforce in recent years. Indeed,
burgeoning supplies of oil, combined with a grave economic slowdown
in Asia that has spread to Russia and Latin America, contributed to
the historic decline in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, based on the clout of the broad coalition of OPEC and
non-OPEC producers, and on hopes that flagging demand in Asia may
be reviving, many analysts saw Friday's cutback plan as
significant.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that it was well timed and could, by the end
of the year, lead to higher crude oil prices and eventually to
rising prices for an enormous range of industries, including
automobiles, plastics and makers of synthetic fibers. Because
inflation has been so low in recent months, however, the near-term
prospects for an increase in inflation caused by the oil price
increase were generally seen as modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is less out of balance than it was a year ago,''
said Ann-Louise Hittle, the director of international petroleum at
Cambridge Energy Associates, an energy consulting group in
Cambridge, Mass. ``Demand is showing slight recovery and low oil
prices have been whittling away at growth in production.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that if the cuts were put into effect they would have
``major impact'' by the end of the year when the current oversupply
of about 1.8 million barrels a day could be worked down and if
demand continued to be strong. She declined to project a specific
price.

 NEW YORK: specific price. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a wait and see attitude among some analysts and
industry experts on whether all of the production cuts would
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil is in the details,'' said Alan Struth, an economist
for Phillips Petroleum, which is based in Bartelsville, Okla. ``Who
complies and who doesn't will be the critical thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of major oil producers called early last year for
cuts of 3.2 million barrels a day, of which OPEC's portion was 2.6
million barrels. For a time, this helped crude oil prices recover.
But as of February, according to a survey by Bloomberg, OPEC had
achieved only about 79 percent of its promised reductions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the drop in demand, particularly in Asia, that was the
main reason last year's price recovery was short-lived and prices
fell again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are reasons for hope that Asian economies and demand
for oil are rebounding, especially in Thailand and South Korea _
and some optimists even mention Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the price of crude oil averaged $14.35 for West Texas
Intermediate compared with $20.60 in 1997. The price for the first
two months this year averaged about $12.25 until a recent recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale gasoline futures rose to a five-month high Friday, as
traders sought to lock in prices, expecting that the prices at the
wholesale level and at the pump would increase moderately in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Although there could be attempts by refiners and station owners
to put through price increases quickly, it has traditionally taken
weeks for increases in futures prices to be passed through to the
pump.
</P>
<P>
   While at first crude oil surged on the news of the meeting, the
run-up abated as the sketchiness of the agreement became evident.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil for April delivery first rose by
as much as 80 cents, to $15.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, before settling back at $14.49 a barrel, up 18 cents for
the day.
</P>
<P>
   What some analysts found to be significant was that the
coalition of major producers has been able to come together again
to lead the effort to make further cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic agreement has survived,'' Ms. Hittle said. ``That is
quite remarkable compared to previous OPEC agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway, another non-OPEC member, is expected to take part in the
newly proposed reductions, the oil ministers said in a statement
issued at The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also said that they have resolved a dispute over
Iran's promised cutbacks, a particularly contentious issue for
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Youcef Yousfi, the oil minister for Algeria who is also the
president of OPEC, said that a more precise breakdown of the cuts
would be given at the organization's meeting on March 23.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the cuts were implemented on April 1, it would take
until May for the flow of oil to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the anticipation of a reduction in supply could
lead to a recovery of crude oil prices before that.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Lichtblau, the chairman of the Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation, an oil industry group based in New York City,
said that it was the huge losses in revenue suffered by the major
oil producers that has spurred them on to seek further cuts.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the OPEC countries, except for Iraq, had seen
revenues from oil exports drop to $100 billion last year compared
with $156 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pays for them to cut back,'' he added, because the higher
prices will bring more revenue than the loss of revenue from
exporting less oil.
</P>
<P>
   While the lower oil prices have led to low gasoline and heating
oil prices, they have also caused major cutbacks in staff by major
oil companies and smaller producers who have shut wells and cut
back on exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of oil service workers in the Southwest have
lost their jobs. Even if oil prices recover, companies will be slow
to add workers until they are sure that the higher prices will be
long term.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtblau also said that if reports were true that Saudi Arabia
had agreed to cut back 600,000 barrels a day, it would mean a major
shift in position. In the past the Saudis have said they would not
cut back below 8 million barrels a day.

FIRST WIN BRINGS STAR TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The team that launched a thousand monologues had
the last laugh on Thursday night by defeating the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Los Angeles Clippers demonstrated you don't have
to have a great team to be good sports. After spending a couple of
hours in preparation for tonight's game with Portland at the Sports
Arena, the players and coaches boarded a bus. Destination: Burbank
and a taping of ``The Tonight Show'' at NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Leno, who has taken more shots at the Clippers this season
than Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant combined, decided to salute
the team's first victory of 1999 by having coach Chris Ford and the
players as guests on his show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad we've got the win,'' Ford said of the hoopla.
``I just stay focused on one game at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   And that next game tonight brings a formidable foe in the Trail
Blazers, who have a 15-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   Told you so: Thursday's victory by Detroit Mercy over UCLA in
the opening round of the NCAA Tournament came as no surprise to
Clippers forward Maurice Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you it would happen,'' said Taylor, cousin of Titans
point guard Rashard Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's coach is Perry Watson, a former Michigan assistant who
was given much of the credit for bringing Taylor to the Wolverines.
</P>
<P>
   Lights, camera, `Kandi': Friday's practice was under the
scrutiny of TNT, which sent a film crew to record footage of rookie
center Michael Olowokandi. The cable network has chosen Olowokandi,
the league's top draft pick, as the subject of an upcoming ``day in
the life'' feature, which actually will require two days of
filming.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two games of Olowokandi's life, he has combined for
three points.
</P>
<P>
   Just shoe it: One of the week's highlights was provided by
forward Tyrone Nesby and the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal in Tuesday's
Lakers-Clippers game at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Nesby, an acrobatic and undrafted 6-foot-6 rookie from Nevada
Las Vegas, attempted to dunk on the 7-1, 318-pound O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The heroic effort resulted in a hard foul by O'Neal that was
judged flagrant. Moments before the tipoff of Wednesday's rematch
at the Forum, Nesby and O'Neal chatted about their collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was sorry he messed me up,'' Nesby said. ``I told
him it was cool, but that I wouldn't mind him hookin' me up with
some shoes. He said he could do that.''

BRUINS' PROBLEMS PERSIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Remove the inconsistencies and the injuries, the
youthful enthusiasm and the endless mistakes, and UCLA's 1998-99
journey went as scripted Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   With nine freshmen and sophomores in prominent roles, the Bruins
were picked fourth in the Pacific-10. They finished third.
</P>
<P>
   In the Associated Press and USA Today/ESPN preseason rankings,
they were slotted 12th and 13th, respectively. In the final
regular-season polls, they finished 12th and 13th, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers figured them for 18-21 wins. They had 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty similar to what I thought,'' UCLA coach Steve
Lavin said. ``I thought maybe we could win the first-round game and
lose the second, or get to the Sweet 16. Across the board, I
figured we'd be third or fourth in the conference and get 20 wins,
which we were able to do. But it would have been nice to go at
least a round further.''
</P>
<P>
   But final judgment will not come for a year or two, when the
freshmen and sophomores are juniors and seniors. If the Bruins
continue to improve _ if they win the Pac-10 title and make a Final
Four run _ this season will stand as a bridge to future success.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not _ if they wallow in the 20-win range and struggle
to survive the tournament's early rounds _ then this season is the
best Lavin can do.
</P>
<P>
   There are three components to coaching: recruiting, motivating
and teaching. Lavin has shown he can sign elite players and get
them to play hard. But his ability (and his staff's ability) to
teach the game, plot strategy and develop talent remains unproven.
</P>
<P>
   There is no replacement for experience and no substitute for
health. The Bruins lacked both this year. If Baron Davis and Dan
Gadzuric had been healthy all season, UCLA may have won another
game or two and received a No. 4 seed instead of a 5, and that
could have made the difference between a first-round exit and a
Sweet 16 finish.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems cut much deeper than injuries and inexperience,
and they begin in practice.
</P>
<P>
   A typical UCLA practice emphasizes conditioning, scrimmaging and
transition drills _ lots of transition drills _ on the premise that
you practice like you play. No doubt, it's effective. The Bruins
are well conditioned and devastating on the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   But several NBA scouts who watched UCLA practice in November and
December dinged the workouts on three counts: lack of teaching,
inattention to detail (uncorrected mistakes), and poor skill
development. The season proved them right.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA won 22 games because it had more talent that its
opposition. Based on Lavin's recruiting, that trend will continue
indefinitely. However, the Bruins will not beat the elite _
Stanford, Maryland, Kentucky, Duke _ until teaching and skill work
receive greater priority in the daily routine.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Davis, a mega-talent who would thrive under any
circumstances, which players improved from Nov. 1 to March 11?
Guard Ray Young and walk-on forward Sean Farnham are probably the
only ones.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jerome Moiso did not improve. If anything, he got worse.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Barnes, Ryan Bailey and Travis Reed never developed
consistency or confidence in Lavin's chaotic substitution pattern.
</P>
<P>
   JaRon Rush never found his 3-point stroke and never stopped
shooting _ especially early in possessions, before the offense was
set and rebounders positioned. He became the poster boy for
impatience.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Watson was as careless with the ball in the final game (six
turnovers) as he was in the first (five turnovers). Davis is
expected to depart for the NBA, placing the ball in Watson's hands
next season. Unless he gains discipline _ and unless his mistakes
are corrected in practice _ fans in the front row had better seek
cover.
</P>
<P>
   And what of injured center Gadzuric, who is expected to recover
from knee surgery by early summer. Currently, Gadzuric has one
low-post move: With his back to the basket, he turns over his left
shoulder and shoots a soft jumper. Will he diversify? Will he
develop a hook? Will he learn to pass out of the post?
</P>
<P>
   Playing pickup games each day in the men's gym won't cut it for
Gadzuric or anyone. The Bruins must devote themselves to the
loneliness of summer skill work.
</P>
<P>
   There's more, of course. The Bruins never learned to shoot free
throws. They never learned to play sound defense without fouling.
They never developed a consistent half-court offense with screens
and ball rotation and a sense for time and score. Davis often
masked the deficiencies with tremendous playmaking, but when he was
on the bench (foul trouble) the offense disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair to judge Lavin on one season with injuries and a
young team. As Arizona and North Carolina proved, the tournament is
a dangerous place for freshmen and sophomores. But if the problems
are not resolved by next March, the future won't look so bright.

NEW-LOOK LAKERS BEAT WARRIORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Business transactions ceased and basketball
resumed Friday at the Forum, and the old Los Angeles Lakers mixed
with the new _ a bushel of imported talents, plucked from all
reaches of the NBA, from retirement homes in Chicago to broken
homes in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   At the helm, a new coach mixed and matched lineups and looked
for effective combinations as the players tried on their new
uniforms and introduced themselves to one another.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA schedule said it was Game 22, but for the megamorphing
power Lakers, this was training camp all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for them, the opponent played like a team that
skipped training altogether, as the new-look Lakers rolled over the
Golden State Warriors 89-78.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad outing for a retooled Lakers team that has undergone
more facelifts than Joan Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   There was Glen Rice and J.R. Reid, newly arrived from Charlotte,
making impressive debuts, and joining Chicago alumnus Dennis
Rodman, still early in his Lakers career, all combining to give
rookie coach Kurt Rambis his ninth straight win and a place in NBA
history.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis' 9-0 start to his coaching career ties the NBA record set
by Buddy Jeannette of the Baltimore Bullets in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means absolutely nothing to me,'' Rambis said of the
record.
</P>
<P>
   But the win, the Lakers' 10th straight, meant plenty for other
reasons. Still recovering from the trade of Eddie Jones and Elden
Campbell and adjusting to all the new parts, the Lakers
nevertheless played like the title contenders they are billed to
be.
</P>
<P>
   They efficiently built a 21-point lead by halftime against the
improved Warriors and extended it to 75-52 by the end of three
quarters. And the main newcomer had his hands in all of it, as Rice
finished with 21 points on rust-slowed 8-of-21 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The post-trade adjustment period might not be very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time a team has to adjust to anything, there's gonna be
problems,'' Rambis said. ``You try to do the best job you can
whenever you have to make an adjustment, whether it's injuries or
players not playing well....
</P>
<P>
   ``All those things come into play, but this year with all the
trade rumors, the trade, the coaching change, all of that, the
players and myself, we've all had to adjust to it, but hopefully
the players understand what direction I want to go and what our
goal is.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all was sunny, however. Derek Harper sprained his left ankle
early in the fourth quarter and had to be helped to the locker
room. Rodman developed a sore right elbow and was limited to eight
minutes in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers frittered their 23-point fourth-quarter lead,
allowing the Warriors to pull within 12 points. Rambis was forced
to send Shaquille O'Neal back into the game with 6:33 left and a
suddenly shaky 14-point lead. Golden State faded after that.
</P>
<P>
   Rice was greeted with a standing ovation (and not a trace of
``Eddie'' chants), but started slowly, missing his first three
shots. But he started drawing fouls and hitting free throws and
found his shooting touch. Rice finished the first half with 11
points after hitting 3 of 9 field goals and 5 of 9 foul shots. But
the vaunted 3-point ace was 0 for 3 from the arc.
</P>
<P>
   Reid scored four points in seven minutes in the first half and
snatched a steal in the backcourt that led to an easy O'Neal
basket.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis chose not to start Rice, who had only been through one
practice since being traded Wednesday. But Rice, who had elbow
surgery on his shooting arm in January, showed no signs of fatigue,
despite not playing in a game since last season.
</P>
<P>
   He probably could have started, but the Lakers went with Rick
Fox and let Rice come off the bench at the 3:57 mark in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to pressure them,'' Rambis said of the new
acquisitions. ``I feel they're going to adjust better if it's just
a slow, gradual process. That's just my feeling, right or wrong.''

OFFICIALS MEET AT SUMMIT ON COMMERCIAL SPACE OPERATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JIM SKEEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- California's state and federal lawmakers must
recognize the importance of the aerospace industry and speak with a
united political voice in order to bring in business, industry
officials said Friday during a ``space summit.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized by state Sen. W.J. ``Pete'' Knight, R-Palmdale, the
summit attracted about 50 people, including representatives of
Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and the entrepreneurial
start-up Space Access. Also in attendance were representatives of
the California Space and Technology Alliance, the state's spaceport
authority.
</P>
<P>
   A common theme during the 2-hour meeting was the need for
California's federal and state legislators to be unified on
aerospace issues. Texas was cited as an example of a place where
legislators recognize that a vote for aerospace is a vote for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a unified political voice,'' said Mark Johnstone,
Palmdale site director for Boeing's Reusable Space Systems
Division.
</P>
<P>
   In the discussion of incentives, Johnstone said that Boeing is
advocating what he called a zero-gravity, zero-tax policy, so that
goods taken into space would not be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not need targeted tax breaks,'' Johnstone said. ``We
want a level playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   California has lagged behind other states in competing for
aerospace business, said John Bass, a Lockheed Martin Skunk Works
vice president. In the 1980s, California plants took in 50 cents of
every dollar spent on the industry. Today that figure is closer to
20 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing, in my estimation, a domestic economic cold
war,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Wurst, whose Palmdale-based Space Access company is
developing a two-stage space launch system, said there is little
recognition by the federal government of the emerging commercial
space business. For instance, there is no way for the government to
order space launch services from the private sector, Wurst said.
</P>
<P>
   His prime desire is to see the government take some action to
show the investment community that there is an interest in the
emerging space market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in the criteria of award of incentives. We
want them based on commercial benefits the launch system offers and
not a reinforcement of the status quo,'' Wurst said.
</P>
<P>
   To help the state compete for space business, the California
Space and Technology Alliance put together a strategic plan. It
includes taking inventory of the state's aerospace suppliers,
conducting a competitiveness analysis of the state in attracting
business and hosting policy summits at the state and federal levels
to get them to support the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have five to 10 years to get policy makers' support
-- we need it this year,'' said Victoria Conner, CSTA's program
director.
</P>
<P>
   The Lancaster City Hall summit was organized as part of a
fact-finding effort by Knight, vice-chairman of the newly created
Senate Select Committee on Defense Conversion, Retention and Space
Flight Industries.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member panel will be responsible for looking at how the
state can promote quick reuse of closed military bases, fight to
retain existing bases and promote space flight industries.
</P>
<P>
   The summit focused on commercial space operations, which are
expected to grow from a $79 billion industry in 1997 to a $117
billion industry in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to capitalize on that business,'' Knight said. ``We
need to make sure that business stays in California.''

WALLY ROCKS WASHINGTON'S WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Sometime last night, Wally Szczerbiak had to have
gone to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Washington Huskies might have had a chance to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought . . . nah.
</P>
<P>
   Awake or asleep, the man can't be spelled, checked or stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what? Not for 43 points worth.
</P>
<P>
   Not when his team scores 59. Not when it's the first round of
the NCAA basketball tournament. Not when his teammates are guys who
wouldn't be in the Huskies' league if it was the Pac-30.
</P>
<P>
   Either Szczerbiak is better than Lew Alcindor, Bill Walton, Gary
Payton, Jason Kidd, Clint Richardson, Sidney Wicks, Sean Elliott
and all the other hoop greats who have put up lesser numbers
against Washington, or the Huskies didn't have much of a clue
Friday in their Midwest Region opener when they allowed themselves
to be posterized into tourney immortality.
</P>
<P>
   While the form chart says a No. 7 seed losing to a No. 10 seed
is only a mild upset, it was plain that Washington had physical
talent superior to tiny, albeit intrepid, Miami of Ohio. What they
didn't have was a better game plan, nor the ability or willingness
to adjust when things went amiss.
</P>
<P>
   So the UW season ended on a 59-58 thud that reverberated around
the mostly empty Superdome, as hollow a place Friday as the Husky
soul.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, Bob Bender was outcoached by his RedHawks counterpart,
Charlie Coles. While Miami came up with a plan to shut down
Washington's strength, Todd MacCulloch, the Huskies were helpless
to faze Szczerbiak even a little. Washington might as well have
tried to catch an eagle with a wheelbarrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He punished us for every breakdown, mentally and physically,''
said a crestfallen Bender, who flopped in the first round this year
as he soared last year _ a one-point decision that came down to the
final defensive stop.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Huskies beat Xavier 69-68 when Deon Luton's
jumper with 11 seconds remaining held up through a final defensive
denial. This time, Washington didn't even get off a game-winning
shot attempt, despite a timeout to set up the final 23 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In the final moments, just as they did the last 30 minutes of
the game, the Huskies didn't look to MacCulloch down low. In
defiance of all known laws of physics, as well as the laws of
basketball that say a 6-6 guy checking a 7-0 guy is dead meat,
MacCulloch (The Bigger Easy) took exactly two more shots in the
second half than the Space Needle, finishing with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to know what was worse _ the offensive failure with
MacCulloch or the defensive failure on Szczerbiak. What is clear is
that the Huskies should be embarrassed on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   Last time a big Washington sports contest had a similar feel was
December's Oahu Bowl against Air Force, in which the physically
imposing Husky football team was whipped by some determined little
meanies who had bigger hearts and better clues.
</P>
<P>
   But give Bender some credit _ unlike former football coach Jim
Lambright, he didn't blame the scout team.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is no one in the college hoops nation capable of
imitating Szczerbiak, nicknamed World before Friday, owner of it
today. As MacCulloch summarized it, ``He's the strongest guy we've
played who can shoot the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   For Seattle hoops followers used to seeing pathetic shooting
because they watch a lot of NBA games, Szczerbiak was a revelation.
A sculpted 6-8, 240-pound senior, he began almost every move facing
the basket, instead of posting underneath. Playing with the zeal of
a man denied his proper vowels, he beat every Husky defender off
the drive, overpowered each inside, and shot over the zone.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising thing was how surprised he was that
Washington failed to prepare a special defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of possessions, we ran set plays, and I got
as open as I've been all year,'' he said. ``In the (Mid-America
Conference), they're always hedging on screens, chasing me around,
bodying me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday when the World turned, he usually found Husky forward
Greg Clark, alone. He didn't do a bad job, but Szczerbiak is an NBA
lottery pick who demands a double-team.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies rarely ran at him a second player, although a 2-3
zone was deployed in the second half with modest success. Bender
said afterwards that the Huskies haven't used or practiced exotic
defenses such as a box-and-one or a diamond-and-two, but that may
change.
</P>
<P>
   A little late, no?
</P>
<P>
   Even more amazing than Szczerbiak's 21 first-half points were
his 22 in the second, demonstrating Washington was unable or
unwilling to force the game into the hands of other RedHawks. At
least Szczerbiak's foes in the MAC held him to an average of 23.6
points a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your league is always toughest on you, because they know you
so well,'' said Coles, whose recovery from a courtside heart attack
13 months ago has made him an endearing tourney story. ``When you
get out of the league, the talent is better and they trust their
great player on our great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Washington nor any other team in the tourney has a match
for Szczerbiak. But opponents can have an alternate strategy,
because the remaining RedHawks in Friday's freakish affair combined
for 19 shots, 14 less than Szczerbiak alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a day and a half,'' said a smiling Coles, looking ahead
to Sunday's match against No. 2 seed Utah, ``to teach these other
guys to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender and his returning Huskies will have spring, summer and
fall in which to be better prepared to face the World, or any like
him.

SZCZERBIAK GOES FOR 43, UW GOES HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Despite being harassed and hounded, Wally
Szczerbiak found enough freedom to terminate Washington's season
Friday in a crushing development on the bayou.
</P>
<P>
   The senior forward scored 43 points to lead Miami of Ohio to a
59-58 victory, knocking down one jumper after another and
flattening Washington in the process, ousting the Huskies from the
NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak hit his career-high during a Midwest Region
first-round game at the Superdome. With 28 points, UW's Donald
Watts matched his.
</P>
<P>
   But the Husky guard was somehow ordinary in comparison, an
obscure figure who tried to rescue his team. Szczerbiak would not
allow any such heroics by anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   He dominated and frustrated the Huskies in a memorable
performance, functioning in an offense designed solely for him,
making 18 of 33 shots and a permanent impression on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player, as good as people said he is,'' Husky
coach Bob Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best shooters I've ever seen,'' said Thalo
Green, one of Szczerbiak's pursuers. ``He's like Reggie Miller. As
soon as he sees daylight, he's firing it up and it's going down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies did too, and the thump could be heard back in
Seattle. Daylight for Szczerbiak meant darkness for Washington. A
potential game against Utah on Sunday turned into a flight home
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room amid the evident disappointment, the Huskies
rationalized and philosophized. Maybe they could have been more
efficient getting the ball to Todd MacCulloch. Maybe they could
have come up with a better defensive plan for Szczerbiak.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huskies played reasonably well. They did not lose as
much as the RedHawks won. And that happened because of one dramatic
effort by Szczerbiak. In his final collegiate game, Watts realized
as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I could get the ball and take us to the win,''
Watts said. ``But there was another guy on the other team that felt
the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak felt it and stroked it, shooting the ball with
remarkable accuracy in effortless fashion. In this city, he was the
big easy, displaying Dan Majerle range and Dan Marino release. The
Huskies discovered that Szczerbiak is tough to spell, stop and
describe, a unique player who is tough and sleek. He is an NBA
lottery pick who enhanced his status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed every time I drove, there weren't two or three guys
ready to help,'' Szczerbiak said. ``I had been used to getting a
lot more double-teams in the MAC Conference. I've got to credit my
guys with getting me open. I didn't really have to force too much
or go one-on-one too much.''
</P>
<P>
   He was consistent throughout, burning Washington from tipoff to
the final horn, scoring 21 points in the first half, 22 in the
second, hitting the first basket and the last.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because of Watts' play, the Huskies were still in position
to win when they called a timeout with 18.3 seconds to play. Watts
got them to this point, completing his career in the way that he
pictured, except for the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling what was to come, Watts finished the first half with a
fast-breaking slam, pulling Washington within 29-26.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, he put the Huskies in front 43-37 during a
spectacular four-minute stretch, scoring 12 straight points for
Washington. It was highlighted by a four-point play, Watts getting
fouled after drilling a three. At that point, Watts hoped the lead
would grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had gotten up by 8, 9 or 10 (points), Mr. Szczerbiak
might have felt a hand around his throat, feeling like: `I have to
make this shot,''' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mr. Szczerbiak never tightened up. He nailed two
straight jumpers, continuing an assault that would put Miami in
front again. The Huskies were not choking Dawgs, either, Watts and
Deon Luton keeping them close, setting up the final possession.
</P>
<P>
   Bender wanted Watts to get the ball on the left wing and dribble
toward the middle off a Luton screen. A Watts shot was the first
option. A pass to MacCulloch in the post was the second option.
Luton was the third.
</P>
<P>
   All went as planned until Watts was stripped with five seconds
remaining, the ball popping into Greg Clark's hands. Knowing his
team's season and the clock were about to expire, Clark attempted
to shoot from the right side, only to be snuffed by Szczerbiak, who
grabbed the ball and dribbled toward a midcourt celebration.
</P>
<P>
   It was Miami madness.
</P>
<P>
   The box score seemed to show that Szczerbiak had little support.
Only two other teammates, Damon Frierson (12) and John Estick (4),
scored. Collecting 43 of his team's total of 59, Szczerbiak
accounted for 73 percent of the points.
</P>
<P>
   But Miami coach Charlie Coles said: ``It's not going to sound
right, but this was a team effort. The screening was the best I've
seen all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The RedHawks' offense uses a variety of multiple screens
designed to unleash Szczerbiak. Defenders get lost in the maze.
</P>
<P>
   ``They use so many screens to get one player open,'' said Clark,
who dogged Szczerbiak throughout. ``You're working your butt off
and it gets to you after awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration factor was apparent at the other end of the
floor. Although MacCulloch had a 6-inch size advantage on his
pestering defenders, he rarely used it. MacCulloch was either not
in good position or open to receive a pass, the consequences being
that the Huskies' meal ticket went hungry.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch experienced two inexplicable stretches: for 30
minutes, the last 11 minutes of the first half and last 19 minutes
of the game, he did not get a shot off. The Husky senior center was
4-for-6, limited to 11 points by Estick, Mike Ensminger and other
helping teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really packing it in inside,'' MacCulloch said.
``They threw two and three guys at me. They tried very hard to keep
me outside of where I like to get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Szczerbiak: ``Our assistant coach, James Woodford, drew a
box on the floor in practice and said, `There is no way that
MacCulloch gets the ball in here. Even if he gets the ball out of
the box, we still double- and triple-team him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year MacCulloch bludgeoned smaller teams Xavier and
Richmond as the Huskies reached the Sweet 16 of this tournament.
This year they were eliminated in the first round on a day that was
as long as their faces.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight year, Washington returns home after a
one-point loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very happy time,'' MacCulloch said. ``This team
fell short of what it is capable of, but we'll never have another
chance to prove it.''

FLORIDA QUIETLY LURKING AS WEBER PLAYS CINDERELLA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Maybe some people never heard of Weber State. Maybe
the new darlings of this NCAA tournament, who sliced and diced
their way through North Carolina on Thursday night and earned their
role as this year's Valparaiso, aren't on too many people's radar.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden, Utah _ home of the Cinderella Weber State Wildcats _ is
not a basketball hotbed too many people get to over the course of a
normal lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   But Billy Donovan, coach of the University of Florida men's
basketball team, isn't one of those guys.
</P>
<P>
   One of basketball's ultimate overachievers, Donovan once had a
long tryout with the Jazz, getting a sampling of Utah's outposts
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when we were going through exhibition season, we
went through Ogden, Logan and we played over at BYU and at Weber
State, so I'm certainly familiar with the place,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Donovan, his tour of Utah was short-lived. The
too-small, too-slow but still undeniable point guard never did make
the Jazz back in 1987, when Utah made him the 68th pick of the NBA
draft right after Donovan led Rick Pitino's Providence to the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still bitter they cut me,'' Donovan said Friday. ``I think
they made a poor decision. And I think I could have done a much
better job than John Stockton did.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, a quintessential New York wise-cracker smile broke
across Donovan's boyish face. He had just zinged off a typical
Donovan ``gotcha,'' and he had accomplished it with just the right
mix of moxie, charm and unrelenting determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's straightforward. He isn't a coach who tells you what you
want to hear,'' Gator senior Greg Stolt said. ``But he tells you
what you need to hear if you want to be a better basketball
player.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why, despite the overwhelming sentiment that says any
good college basketball fan must root for the darlings of Weber
State in Saturday's second-round NCAA tournament game, there is
still room to quibble that Donovan and his Gators are also worthy
of, at the very least, more than cursory dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the Gators' fault that Weber State and NCAA insta-star
Harold ``The Show'' Arceneaux will have the support of the KeyArena
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we shouldn't be the Cinderella of this
tournament,'' Donovan lobbied. ``This is only the fifth time
Florida has been in the tournament. Weber State's been in 12
times.''
</P>
<P>
   With such salesmanship techniques, you can now understand why
fellow coaches such as South Carolina's Eddie Fogler and Kansas'
Roy Williams have gotten real panicky over Donovan. He is beating
them to key recruits and they loathe him for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the three seasons at Florida, Donovan has tenaciously
competed for the very same McDonald's All-Americans who previously
never would have given the Gators as much as a second look. Now,
Donovan is stocking the roster with players who he hopes put
Florida on the basketball map, year in and year out.
</P>
<P>
   That will be quite a change.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to Florida, but the last time the Gators made a dent
in NCAA tournament, they were a sleeper that made it all the way to
the 1994 Final Four and put a fair share of diehard hoops fans to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Gators? College basketball? It used to be the only time the
hoops team would draw a crowd is if football coach Steve Spurrier
was in the house.
</P>
<P>
   This season, though, something unbelievable occurred in
Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 150 Gator basketball fans camped outside the arena
the night before Florida played Kentucky in an SEC showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, the 33-year-old wunder-coach out of Pitino's
Providence-New York Knicks-Kentucky crucible, thanked the fans by
buying them boxes of pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Florida now also has something called the Rowdy Reptiles. This
is a fan group whose rabid allegiance belongs to the basketball
team _ one that is seeded No. 6 in the West and looking to knock
off Arceneaux and those other Weber darlings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arceneaux can put a show on. That's why he gets his
nickname,'' Donovan said. ``I've been very impressed with him as a
basketball player. He's got a great feel how to play. He's got
great tempo, range, he can put it down and create his own shot. He
can put it down at the free-throw line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can put a guy on him and say, `OK, guard
him.' He just has too many ways to score because he can use
screens, he can go one-on-one and he can post up.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Carolina was too big, too slow and too green for the
crafty Wildcats, the Gators will present an entirely different
look.
</P>
<P>
   An unabashed Pitino disciple, Donovan is completely committed to
the full-court press. And now that Donovan has brought in freshman
sensations such as Mike Miller and Teddy Dupay, the Gators finally
have the horses to run the floor for 40 exhausting minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very demanding style of play for your coaching staff
and your players,'' Donovan said. ``When you see that style on TV,
it's obviously a very entertaining, but I don't think people truly
understand the type of shape you need to be in play 40 minutes of
that type of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the darlings of Weber State are going to get a taste
of ``Billy Ball.'' It is distilled directly from the Final Four
squads Donovan played a part in at Providence and Kentucky, where
he was Pitino's assistant for six years.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Billy Ball'' is the kind of thing that, much to the
chagrin of everyone rooting for Weber State, could probably break a
Cinderella's glass slipper.

LITTLE GONZAGA GUNNING FOR GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Gonzaga not only wants to beat Stanford on Saturday
and become a Sweet 16 team, but mimic the Cardinal basketball
program.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities already are obvious to Bulldogs coach Dan
Monson.
</P>
<P>
   ``University-wise, there is not much difference,'' he said
Friday. ``Gonzaga and Stanford are both very small schools with
good academic traditions and play with a lot of the similar type
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a disparity in talent, it might show up at KeyArena
in the second round of the NCAA tournament sub-regional. The highly
ranked Cardinal, the only Pac-10 team remaining, takes on the
Bullogs, the only West Coast Conference team invited.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's opener, surprising Weber State plays Florida.
</P>
<P>
   From a local standpoint, the first game is the most anticipated:
Little Gonzaga of the WCC against high-profile Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between a Stanford kid (and a Gonzaga player)
is they get kids who are a little more ready-made than us,'' Monson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford gets players ready to step in and be stars. Gonzaga
develops stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a good program to model after, and maybe I am trying
to kid myself to take my program and model (it) after theirs,''
Monson said. ``But I think it's the right way to do it. They have a
good system with good kids and I have a lot of respect for how they
get it done there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford and Gonzaga programs are chugging along on a
parallel path.
</P>
<P>
   Both have been 20-game plus winners for several years now and
elite teams in their respective leagues. Both are league champions
this season.
</P>
<P>
   And here they are, in the same place, wanting to go to the same
place _ the West Regionals in Phoenix next week.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, the Bulldogs don't have an inferiority complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our matchup advantage is our offense,'' said Richie
Frahm, one of the most accurate long-range shooters in college.
``If we execute and play well as a team, get all of the guys shots,
then I think that's our advantage. As far as personnel-wise, I
think we match up perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might be a little thicker down low, but our guys are
going to be aggressive and overcome that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seniors Mark Madsen and Tim Young anchor a Cardinal front line
that outrebounded Alcorn State, 45-23, Thursday. It is up Gonzaga
senior center Jeremy Eaton (6-foot-11) and sophomore forward Casey
Calvary (6-foot-8) to handle most of the Gonzaga board work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say they are a lot more mobile than we are,'' Madsen
said. ``They go outside more than we do and shoot more jumpers. Tim
and I, the majority of our moves are made close to the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Whichever team controls the boards has the best chance of
reaching the West Regionals in Phoenix next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanford rebounds well and so do we,'' Monson said. ``They had
16 offensive rebounds (against Alcorn State) and we can't afford to
let them stand under the basket and keep taking shots until they
make one.''
</P>
<P>
   Blocking out and long-range shooting accuracy tops Gonzaga's
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are an excellent 3-point shooting team and it obviously
is something we will have to defend,'' Cardinal coach Mike
Montgomery said. ``I hope we can defend the three as well as we
have on most occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   Seniors Arthur Lee and Kris Weems probably will be responsible
for keeping guard Matt Santangelo and Frahm from catching fire from
the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gonzaga is definitely a good 3-point shooting team,'' Lee
said, ``but we have seen a lot of them throughout the course of the
season. We just have to do what we have been all year long, which
is have someone in their face throughout the game and don't let
them get open looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that is easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldog philosophy was established long before now and few
teams have been able to stop them on the way to becoming the
winningest team in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball fans around the country don't know much about
Gonzaga, but the Cardinal is well aware of the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard about them a lot this year, being on the West
Coast,'' Madsen said. ``We were in the area when they came down and
beat Santa Clara by 30 or 40 points. We're definitely familiar with
the fact that they are good and have a lot of different attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as respecting them, it is easier to respect them, given
the fact we have seen them more this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating Stanford would make Gonzaga a Sweet 16 team and elevate
the basketball program to another level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, every win you get in the NCAA tournament is
unbelievable exposure,'' Monson said. ``It's great for your school,
your alumni. The win (Thursday against Minnesota) probably was the
biggest win in our program because we have gone into unchartered
waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we are out to sea a little farther. If we win that would
be even more uncharted waters and we want to go all the way to
ocean. We want to test all the waters out there.''

LARROQUETTE'S NEW SERIES PAINFUL AT TIMES; `RESCUE' CAN'T BE
SAVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy to watch John Larroquette. That elastic ability in
front of the camera is often better than a second serving of
profiteroles. From his Emmy-winning dramatic turn last season on
``The Practice,'' to his multi-Emmy tour de force as Dan Fielding
in ``Night Court'' to his understated comedic brilliance on ``The
John Larroquette Show,'' the tall actor from New Orleans is
something to behold.
</P>
<P>
   But watching him in ``Payne'' is painful. The timing is still
there, the comic flourishes perfectly expansive, the booming voice
still booming when it needs to be, but Larroquette's new comedy for
CBS may have to be an acquired taste.
</P>
<P>
   Based on John Cleese's farcical ``Fawlty Towers'' of a
generation ago, ``Payne'' has Larroquette playing Royal Payne, the
contemptuous and contemptible proprietor of Whispering Pines, a
small hotel on the California coast. JoBeth Williams plays his
wife, Constance Payne, in the role that Prunella Scales created
opposite Cleese.
</P>
<P>
   Williams may unwittingly be part of the problem. She told
critics a couple of months ago that she senses an easy chemistry
when working with Larroquette, but it's not apparent in the three
episodes provided for review. While the lines might be funny, even
inspired, they seem forced and uncomfortably stilted as delivered
by the two stars.
</P>
<P>
   Such stiltage _ or is it stilton? _ might have worked in a
British farce like ``Fawlty Towers.'' But it seems cheesy in an
American sitcom. Besides, U.S. audiences are more likely to compare
``Payne'' with ``Newhart,'' which ran for eight seasons on CBS,
four of them in Nielsen's Top 20.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Bob Newhart's Dick Loudon was kind and gentle where
Larroquette's Royal Payne is mean and cranky, but as hotel-themed
comedies go, they're very much alike, complete with the oddball
supporting characters. Bottom line: ``Newhart'' was funnier, and
it's still available on Nickelodeon's Nick at Nite.
</P>
<P>
   In its well-modulated rush to probe the hearts and minds of Los
Angeles paramedics, ``Rescue 77'' takes the viewer on an emotional
roller coaster that runs the gamut from medium to moderate ,
stopping ever so briefly at somewhat restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because paramedics have to be cool and sober under
all sorts of trying conditions. Or maybe it's the acting. Or the
writing. Or maybe the cameras were rolling during a full-dress
run-through and producer/director Eric Laneuville, who cut his
teeth in the hallowed halls of ``St. Elsewhere,'' figured it was
good enough for an Aaron Spelling production.
</P>
<P>
   A Spelling production obviously means the men are chiseled and
the women are also. But for an action/adventure series with an
impressive pedigree _ its creator is former firefighter and
``Backdraft'' alumnus Gregory Widen _ ``Rescue 77'' is surprisingly
unexciting, even as our heroes are dangling from a helicopter as
they try to rescue a pilot from a smashed airplane on an L.A.
hillside.
</P>
<P>
   The principal players in this WB drama _ Marjorie Monaghan,
Victor Browne, Christian Kane and Richard Roundtree _ never
progress beyond stick figures on the storyboard, even as Widen
tries to mix a little pathos in with the pacing.

<P>
   Aside from some Sarah McLachlan music halfway through Monday
night's premiere, ``Rescue 77'' has a weaker pulse than ``Hyperion
Bay,'' the series it's temporarily replacing. And instead of
real-life situations, we get fake-life monologues like this, when
Browne's character, Michael Bell, gives Monaghan's character,
Kathleen Bell, a heart-to-heart after a tough day: ``You have to
get up now,'' he says, ``walk back to the rig, make some dark joke
about it that no one else will understand, and go on. Or not.''

   As a viewer, I choose ``not.''

CALIFORNIA SHOULD UTILIZE PROVEN PROGRAM MODELS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The most exciting feature of Proposition 10 is its
goal of helping every child in California to begin life in a
nurturing and supportive home.
</P>
<P>
   The architects, managers and leaders of homes are parents, and
they deserve and need the best information and training to carry
out their critically important roles.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 10 recognizes this by including parenting education
as one of the services that can and should be underwritten by the
hundreds of millions of dollars that are now available statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the driving force behind Proposition 10, Rob Reiner, a
caring and concerned parent, rightfully states that parenting
education is the core service.
</P>
<P>
   It behooves the state and county commissions that will decide
exactly how the funds will be used to keep the centrality of
parenting education clearly in mind.
</P>
<P>
   It is also equally as important that they do not reinvent the
programmatic wheel when it comes to parenting education. Many
excellent, research-proven parenting programs already exist.
</P>
<P>
   These carefully crafted programs were developed by a variety of
knowledgeable organizations in different parts of the country and
through a variety of research and demonstration projects, many
supported by public tax dollars. The best programs have been
recognized as national models for helping parents become more
effective and for preventing a wide range of social and health
problems that stem from uniformed and ineffective parenting, such
as child abuse, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and school
failure.
</P>
<P>
   These programs provide the basic child development information
that all parents need in order to have realistic expectations about
what infants and young children can and cannot do. They teach a
series of parenting strategies and skills for creating rich,
supportive and safe physical and social surroundings for children.
They orient parents how to relate to these little people with the
proper mix of warmth, responsiveness and nonviolent guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these programs are designed for parents of children who
are particularly challenging, either because of temperament and
behavior or because of health problems. A few of the programs also
address the importance of cultural values and traditions in child
rearing. They help parents instill a sense of cultural pride right
from the beginning, including programs that were originally
developed here in California like the ``Effective Black Parenting''
and ``Los Ninos Bien Educados'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   These programs can be taught through a variety of formats and
through several different mediums. They can be taught as classes or
seminars, which are led by instructors who have received
professional training. They can be taught on a one-to-one basis
through home visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Their teaching can also be conveyed through video-based and
CD-ROM versions that do not require instructors or through the
radio, television and the Internet. It is also now possible to
teach the course over the phone through teleconferencing
technology. The most enduring results, however, seem to come from
in-person classes and seminars. It is wise to have all formats
available in all communities.
</P>
<P>
   The state and county commissions are in complementary positions
to ensure that all communities are provided equal access to the
full spectrum of top programs and service delivery formats.
</P>
<P>
   One of the primary missions of the state commission is to
provide technical assistance, professional training and public
education, which supports the community services that the county
commissions decide to underwrite with their lion's share of the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The state commission could create a state-of-the-art
clearinghouse of parenting and parent training program information
and research that would help form decisions about community
services having to do with parenting. They could initiate a
parenting instructor training academy to prepare cadres of
qualified persons from local schools and agencies to deliver the
best programs. They could also conduct a statewide public education
campaign about the value of parenting education, which could be
patterned after the Effective Parenting Campaign that the Center
for the Improvement of Child Caring is currently running in several
Southern California counties.
</P>
<P>
   With these supports, the county commissions would be able to
carry out the parent education mandates of Proposition 10 with a
solid base of knowledge and professional assistance. Then the
public would be assured that the parenting services that are made
available in each county are of the highest quality.
</P>
<P>
   As these high-quality services become widely available in every
community in the state, more and more of California's children will
receive the most meaningful gift that comes with the passage of
Proposition 10: the gift of effective parenting.
</P>
<P>
   It is a gift that keeps giving, since effectively parented
children pass on the basics of a caring and humane society.

KINGS, ROBINSON SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rob Blake's speech to his teammates was only the
first meeting the Los Angeles Kings held Thursday. In the second,
the Kings' captain and his alternates, Luc Robitaille and Doug
Bodger, approached the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, coach Larry Robinson disclosed that among other things,
the players suggested Robinson stick with the lineup that recorded
a 4-2 victory Tuesday night over the Detroit Red Wings. Robinson
added that he will follow the advice when the Kings (24-36-5) face
the Vancouver Canucks at 7 tonight at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is we've had so much inconsistency that I've been
trying to find a spark somewhere, or find a combination somewhere
that's going to work,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   And as a result, Robinson has spent much of the season
tinkering, a tendency he said he will refrain from tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players, that was the biggest thing that they came to me
and said was, `Let's work on this reward system. If the team is
playing well and the guys are playing well, why mix it up?' ''
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I was doing that only to try to take the personnel
I felt that we had and put it together the best way I knew how to
go against the team that we were playing. They feel if they stick
with the same guys, they'll be able to beat any team, so we'll try
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, with 17 games remaining and a seven-point gap
between his team and a Western Conference playoff berth, Robinson
is open to suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an employer,'' he said. ``You've got to listen to
your employees. They're the ones that are doing the work for you.
If they feel this is one of the things that's going to help them
play better and win hockey games, then, hey, nothing that we do is
etched in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to stick with the status quo will mean another
unwanted night off for defenseman Steve Duchesne, who was a healthy
scratch Tuesday and won't play tonight unless Robinson has a sudden
change of heart. Duchesne, in the first season of a three-year,
$11.25-million contract, has struggled most of the season,
producing just 23 points while posting a minus-6 defensive rating.
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne made it clear Friday that he is disappointed with his
present situation, but he also stressed that he willingly accepts
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come to L.A. to do poorly,'' said Duchesne, who
played for St. Louis last season. ``I feel a little bit like I let
my teammates down. It's not for lack of trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a comment this week by Robinson that he hasn't
adequately been ``paying the price'' to make plays - a reference to
Duchesne's reputation for skirting physical contact - Duchesne
said, ``I don't want to say anything, so let's just put it that
way, OK. I don't want to cause any trouble. ... I'd like to tell
you probably a lot more. I want to be positive. I don't want to
cause any trouble with the coaching staff or myself. I want my
teammates to play well, think about hockey and win. I'll be there
to support them.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said some of Duchesne's difficulties might stem from
the high expectations held for him when the Kings signed him as a
free agent last summer. Primary was the expectation that he would
spark the Kings' power play, which instead has been among the worst
in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``And sometimes you can take a player,'' Robinson added, ``and
he looks good in a certain organization, and then he gets out of
that organization and somehow, he doesn't blend with the style
you're playing or the people that you're playing with. Good hockey
players are the ones who should be able to adjust. I think he's
capable of adjusting. I think he just hasn't made that adjustment
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still a great skater. He still sees the ice well. He can
do all those things. He's just got to put it together, stop trying
to be something that you're not. He's a good hockey player. He's
just got to get out there and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he will get his next opportunity, though, remains to be
seen.

LIFELESS TEXAS FALLS TO PURDUE
</HEADLINE>
 REGION-TEXAS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Somewhere, Tom Penders might be laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about the former Texas coach. When his teams
got into the NCAA Tournament, they won _ seven of eight first-round
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns were the not-ready-for-tournament-time players
Friday night and lost a most winnable NCAA East Region game to
Purdue, 58-54.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers, who lost four of their last five games, in
essence won on forward Cameron Stephens' 19-foot jumper with less
than five seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' answer? So typical of the night's performance, Gabe
Muoneke threw a half-court pass that Kris Clack caught off-balance,
tumbling out of bounds with it while 4.1 seconds remained.
</P>
<P>
   On the inbounds pass, Ivan Wagner quickly fouled Purdue's Tony
Mayfield, who had the assist on Stephens' bucket. Mayfield sank
both free throws to seal the Boilermakers' victory.
</P>
<P>
   Texas (19-13) had time, however, to throw away one more pass
before falling for the third time in its last four games after
streaking to the Big 12 regular-season championship.
</P>
<P>
   One might have expected Texas coach Rick Barnes at some point to
throw his coat, kick a chair, to do something to bring life into a
lifeless team.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes never ignited _ and neither did the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Texas joined the ranks of the NCAA Tournament's unlucky sevens,
becoming the fourth seventh seed to lose to a No. 10 in the
tournament's first two days. Luck, however, had little to do with
Texas' loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns committed 22 turnovers and for most of the night
ignored Chris Mihm inside, although the 7-foot sophomore scored 21
points and pulled down 14 rebounds. Muoneke, with 12, was the only
other UT player to score in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Down one point at the half, Texas started the second half
playing the way it had most of the season, but soon reverted to its
dismal, inconsistent first-half performance and never led by more
than two. Purdue couldn't establish any consistency, either, and
the teams traded the lead six times heading into the last four
minutes with the Boilermakers up, 50-49.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clay made a 3-pointer that tied the score at 54-54 with
24.8 seconds to play. Purdue executed down the stretch. Texas
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Texas trailed at the half, 30-29. But they likely would have
been further back had they not been playing the only team in the
field of 64 with a losing conference record.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue, 7-9 in the Big Ten, outhustled, outjumped and outplayed
the Longhorns, although emotional leader Brian Cardinal spent the
last 10 minutes of the half on the bench with two fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Gene Keady could afford to let Cardinal sit because the
Longhorns were flat-footed and acted as if they had never played
together before. Wagner started bad and never got better. Muoneke
and Clay hit rare 3-pointers for Texas' first six points, but
Wagner threw the ball away twice in between.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue led 18-11 at the midway point, before Cardinal picked up
his second foul. Yet, Texas couldn't _ or refused _ to take
advantage by going inside to Mihm, although he was guarded by 6-7
Greg McQuay or 6-10 freshman John Allison.
</P>
<P>
   When Texas did throw inside, it was usually on a bounce pass and
usually resulted in a scramble that prevented Mihm from getting off
a shot. Fortunately, he got to the line, where eight of his 10
points came during the half. His only bucket was on a follow shot
that tied the game at 27-27 with 3:40 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns outscored the Boilermakers 12-1 to come from 20-13
down to a 25-20 lead. Mihm had four field goals and Clack a
3-pointer from the right corner during the run. Texas couldn't keep
it going, however and McQuay put Purdue up with a follow slam with
37.4 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Texas called a time out five seconds later, but the best they
could do was to set up Chico Vazquez for a missed 3-pointer from
deep in the right corner _ the 15th miss of 23 attempts in the
half. nn

STARS CLINCH PLAYOFF BERTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Dallas Stars won the battle of streaks Friday
night, dominating the hottest team in hockey and clinching a
playoff berth in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In crunching the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, 4-0, the Stars went
streak crazy. Among the notables:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Stars ran their undefeated streak against the Ducks to
10-0-1 in their past 11 games at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Stars stopped the Ducks' eight-game unbeaten streak
(7-0-1), which was the hottest in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Stars ran their unbeaten streak in their alternate ``green
star'' jersey to 14-0-5. In fact, they have not lost since
introducing the third sweater last season.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk had two goals to stretch his consecutive
game-scoring streak to nine games.
</P>
<P>
   And the Stars stopped Teemu Selanne's point-scoring streak at 17
_ one short of the losingest in the NHL this season (18 games by
Eric Lindros of the Flyers).
</P>
<P>
   In winning their third consecutive game before the 29th
consecutive sellout crowd of 16,928 at Reunion Arena, and
stretching their home-winning streak to five games, the Stars moved
to 42-12-10 _ going 30 games above .500 for the first time in
franchise history. They clinched a playoff berth at the earliest
date in franchise history. Since the Calgary Flames, who sit ninth
in the Western Conference, lost Friday night, they can garner no
more than 92 points. The Stars have 94.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very strong, very methodical,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``We didn't want to give them anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In a game filled with plenty of pushing and shoving and a few
fights, Ed Belfour recorded 27 saves to notch his 44th career
shutout _ two behind Patrick Roy of the Colorado Avalanche for the
lead among active NHL goalies. He was helped out by a defense
featuring sterling performances by Derian Hatcher, Sergei Zubov,
Richard Matvichuk, Shawn Chambers, Craig Ludwig and Sergey Gusev.
In addition, the Stars forwards wore down the Ducks and kept
Anaheim's scoring chances to the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie was good, but the whole defense was good,'' Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, whose line was given the assignment of checking Selanne
and Paul Kariya _ two of top-five scorers in the NHL _ led off the
scoring with his 29th goal of the season. Jamie Langenbrunner set
up the goal with hard work behind the net and Modano was left wide
open for an easy slam dunk at the 5:09 mark of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hrkac then gave the Stars a needed cushion when he scored
at the 10:23 mark of the second period off a strong setup from Mike
Keane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever scored first was going to have the advantage,''
Hitchcock said. ``When we scored first, they had to take some
chances and that created some open ice for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk cashed in on that open ice for two goals in the third
period _ his 19th and 20th on the season and his eighth in the past
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   With Nieuwendyk playing healthy after battling soreness in his
knees for much of the season, the Stars have two lines clicking at
the same time. In addition to Nieuwendyk's streak, Modano has five
goals in the past five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best players were our best players,'' Hitchcock said.
``When that happens, we're in pretty good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars prepare for a three-game road trip in which they play
the Philadelphia Flyers on Sunday, the Pittsburgh Penguins on
Tuesday and the Washington Capitals on Wednesday. They return to
Reunion Arena on Friday to face the red-hot Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fun time of the year,'' Modano said. ``These are
the good challenges.'' nn

PURDUE SLIPS PAST LETHARGIC TEXAS

<P>
   BOSTON _ You expected Texas coach Rick Barnes at some point to
throw his coat, kick a chair, do something to get some life into a
lifeless team.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes never ignited _ and neither did the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Texas thus dropped a winnable first-round NCAA Tournament East
Region game to Purdue on Friday night, 58-54, to join the ranks of
the NCAA Tournament's unlucky sevens. The Longhorns were the fourth
seventh seed to lose to a No. 10 in the tournament's first two

</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns committed 22 turnovers and for most of the night
ignored Chris Mihm inside, even though the 7-foot sophomore scored
21 points and pulled down 14 rebounds. Gabe Muoneke, with 12, was
the only other UT player in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disappointing way to end the season,'' Mihm said. ``I wish
we could have kept the momentum we had going. We did sort of
tighten up and that's uncharacteristic of us all year. I don't know
what to say. It's an NCAA Tournament and it's one and done.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also couldn't explain his team's play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some guys do some things they haven't done in a long
time,'' he said. ``I could sit here and say maybe it was nerves,
but again, I don't know the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we're a better basketball team than we were tonight.
But that's the problem in this tournament. If you're not playing
good basketball at this time of year, you're done. So much of it
gets down to situational play, and if you can't handle situations,
you go home. There's a lot we didn't do. But the biggest thing is
we just turned it over.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas won seven of eight first-round games under former coach
Tom Penders, but Friday night the Longhorns were the
not-ready-for-tournament-time players.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers, who lost four of their last five games, in
essence won on forward Cameron Stephens' 19-foot jumper with less
than five seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little piece of the shot,'' Mihm said. ``But it went
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas' answer? Typical of the night's performance, Muoneke threw
a half-court pass that Kris Clack caught off-balance, and tumbled
out of bounds with 4.1 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Wagner on the inbound pass quickly fouled Purdue's Tony
Mayfield, who had the assist on Stephens' bucket. Mayfield sank
both free throws to seal the Boilermakers' victory.
</P>
<P>
   Texas (19-13) had time, however, to throw away one more pass.
</P>
<P>
   Down one at the half, Texas started the second half playing the
way it had most of the season, but soon reverted to its dismal,
inconsistent, flat-footed first-half performance and never led by
more than two. Purdue couldn't establish any consistency, either,
and the teams traded the lead six times heading into the last four
minutes with the Boilermakers up, 50-49.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner scored on a drive for a 51-50 lead. But Jaraan Cornell,
who led with 18, scored four consecutive points on a 15-foot jumper
and two free throws sandwiched around a UT turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clay made a 3-pointer that tied the score at 54 with 24.8
seconds to play. Purdue then executed down the stretch. Texas
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of my players, the way they fought back from
playing poorly and got it together the past 10 or 12 days,'' Purdue
coach Gene Keady said. ``Tonight was one of those games that could
have gone either way.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue's Brian Cardinal (14 points) claimed that Muoneke punched
him twice in a spill six minutes into the half. Muoneke said they
traded elbows and repeated replays appeared to back Muoneke's
version. Barnes said he would take a look and deal with the
incident if it was as Cardinal claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt he did a couple of things that were unnecessary,''
Muoneke said. ``The referee came up to me and said don't worry
about it, just stay out of the way. So he knew what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He elbowed me twice. ... so if he wants to vocalize what
really went wrong, go ask him. He knows what he did. And I'm not
going to take that from anybody. I didn't punch him. I did the same
thing he did to me _ plain and simple.'' nn

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WARMING OURSELVES BESIDE SHAKESPEARE'S FIRE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Shakespeare seems to be everywhere. Last summer's Lincoln Center
production of ``Twelfth Night,'' starring Helen Hunt, may have
begun this current Shakespearean moment, but it has really been
caused by the conjunction of Tom Stoppard's and Marc Norman's movie
``Shakespeare in Love'' and Harold Bloom's critical study called
``Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human.''
</P>
<P>
   Few films have ever let us pretend we know Shakespeare as well
as ``Shakespeare in Love'' does, even though that knowledge is a
fiction. And not perhaps since Samuel Johnson in the mid-18th
century has a critic explained to a general audience as ably as
Bloom does how much Shakespeare matters to our sense of who we are.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers will point out that Western culture has been having
a Shakespearean moment for most of the past three centuries, though
that moment, as Gary Taylor suggests in ``Reinventing
Shakespeare,'' has taken many different forms. Bloom, too, notices
the ways we reinvent Shakespeare when he attacks the academic
attempt to usurp Shakespeare, the effort by critics he calls
``resenters'' to nullify, by moralizing and historicizing, the
deeply human presence we feel in so many of Shakespeare's plays.
Bloom has always been a student of poetic envy, and part of what
makes his book so bracing is that he allies himself naturally with
Shakespeare's greatest readers, with Samuel Johnson, Charles Lamb,
William Hazlitt, G.K. Chesterton, all of them distinguished by the
generosity of their literary insight.
</P>
<P>
   We are watching, in this momentary popular focus on Shakespeare,
one of the things that makes Shakespeare fascinating. It's as
though at this instant we were huddled around a Shakespearean fire
on a night not as harsh as Lear's, of course, but not as magical as
Bottom's either. The subject of conversation, as Bloom makes clear,
isn't just Shakespeare. The subject is also all the conversations
he has inspired over time. Many men and women, moved by what this
one man wrote, have been drawn to this fire, and their voices, of
considerable magnitude in themselves, still hover invisibly in the
air, like Ariel's or Puck's. The society of readers gathered around
this fire is an open one, and it is precisely as broad as the
society of Shakespeare's characters. That is to say it includes not
only everyone but also, to borrow Bloom's native hyperbole,
everyone possible.
</P>
<P>
   Flame is indeed a reasonable metaphor for Shakespeare's
language. It heats, it consumes, it shapes and reshapes itself and
everything it touches, and it seems both tangible and intangible,
as vaporous in appearance as its effects are real. One time you
find yourself reading Shakespeare for the imagery _ the occasions
of metaphoric transcendence _ and the next time, the next line, for
words of irreducible simplicity, like the ones Lear speaks as his
sanity flickers back to him in Cordelia's presence: ``Pray, do not
mock me. I am a very foolish fond old man.'' Bloom's argument is
that in characters like Falstaff, Iago, Hamlet and Cleopatra,
Shakespeare invented the inwardness of the human self. He could not
have done that without also reinventing the language. Looked at one
way, Shakespeare's people melt into words and his words into ink.
Looked at another way, they are only as insubstantial as the selves
we muster every day.

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NATO (Independence, Mo.) _ Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic Friday became the first former members of the old Soviet
bloc to join NATO, expanding the Western military alliance to 19
members. At a ceremony in the hometown of the late U.S. President
Harry Truman, the foreign ministers of the three new members signed
formal documents of accession and gave them to U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, who told the ministers: ``You are truly
allies, you are truly home.'' By Jane Perlez. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-ASSESS (Independence, Mo.) _ News Analysis: A feeling of
deliverance from an implacably cruel fate suffused the little
auditorium at th Harry S. Truman Library in Independence, Mo.,
where the ceremony took place. It took place here, of course,
because it was Truman, with his secretary of state, Dean Acheson,
who called NATO into existence to meet the Soviet threat after
World War II. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   MARINE-AVIATOR-ITALY (Rome) _ Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
warned Friday that Italy may want to make some changes to the NATO
alliance. D'Alema, like the rest of Italy, was outraged by the
acquittal of the U.S. pilot who flew into a ski lift cable in
Northern Italy last year, killing 20 people. Under NATO rules, the
United States had jurisdiction over the case. By Alessandra Stanley
</P>
<P>
   ALGERIA-TRAIN (Oran, Algeria) _ In the 1990s, life in Algeria
has been disfigured by massacres of entire villages, bombings in
restaurants and cafes and killings of artists, journalists and
others judged to have offended Islamic mores. But few experiences
have been as unnerving as riding Train 1001. On its seven-hour run
from Algiers to Oran, the country's second-largest city, it has
been attacked at least 25 times, usually with land mines. Now Train
1001 has become a new kind of symbol, of an Algeria working its way
back from the brink. After years of running half-empty, the train
is full again and runs safely for months at a time. By John F.
Burns. With photos and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ Kosovo Liberation Army leaders
decided Friday to accept a European-sponsored peace plan and
directed the leader of the ethnic Albanian delegation to sign the
accord ahead of peace talks that are planned to resume on Monday in
Paris. By Carlotta Gall. With photo.

<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TRADES-SHORTAGE (Chicago) _ Faced with a shortage of
tradesworkers to meet the voracious demand for new construction in
the United States, desperate builders and eager unions have kicked
off aggressive campaigns to court new workers, attracting women and
members of racial minorities to the traditional bastion of white
men, a world where a coveted union card was handed from father to
son. By Dirk Johnson. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   FBI-INFORMER (Boston) _ It began in 1995 as a simple
racketeering indictment whose defendants included two reputed mob
leaders long infamous in Irish-dominated South Boston: James
(Whitey) Bulger and Stephen (The Rifleman) Flemmi. By now, however,
the case has become what many call one of the most embarrassing
messes for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in years. And it has
called into question one of the oldest practices in law enforcement
and one of the most troublesome: the use of confidential informers
to fight organized crime. By Carey Goldberg. With photos.

<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON _ (Moved in ``w'' category)  &LR;

<P>
   REPUBS-ASSESS (Washington) _ As they seek their way after
impeachment, congressional Republicans these last few weeks have
gone on the offensive against President Clinton on national
security and foreign policy, while taking stands on Social Security
and education that will allow them to make some claim to those
domestic concerns. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-RUMORS (Washington) _ In the suspicion-rich aftermath of
Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, impeachment, and the rest of it, a
strange and ghoulish vigil has undeniably taken hold here. It's a
marital death watch, perhaps arising less from any smoke signals
that the Clintons are sending out than from Washington insiders'
presumptions about what they would do were they in Mrs. Clinton's
pumps. By Frank Bruni. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   OIL-TALKS (Undated) _ A group of major oil producers announced
Friday that they had agreed to cut oil production by 2 million
barrels a day, a move that sent depressed crude oil prices upward.
Some analysts said that if the cuts are implemented as planned by
April 1 they could lead to a steady recovery of crude oil prices,
which would lead to an increase in the price of gasoline. But
others said that even if the supply cuts stick, the increase at the
pump would be modest at first _ about 5 cents a gallon. By Agis
Salpukas. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   OIL-INFLATION _ The oil price surge this year, which got another
boost Friday with a new agreement on cutting production, is
beginning to sting consumers. But despite the oil price increase,
economists are not predicting a new surge in inflation across the
board. Rather, they are merely saying that the decline in inflation
will be over if the oil-price rises stick. By Jonathan Fuerbringer.
</P>
<P>
   BANKERS-TRUST (New York) _ Federal authorities probing
corruption at Bankers Trust New York Corp. are focusing their
investigation around the activities of B.J. Kingdon, who formerly
ran one of the bank's largest businesses and sat on its 12-member
operating committee, according to lawyers and Bankers Trust
employees involved in the investigation. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   REDSKINS-SALE (Undated) _ Two months ago, when Howard Milstein
and his partners agreed to buy the Washington Redskins, it looked
as if nothing could stand in the way of their dream of acquiring a
National Football League team. But Milstein has faced an
unexpectedly rocky road. And if the league's finance committee
rejects the deal, Milstein and his partners will lose not only the
team, but a $30 million nonrefundable deposit. By Richard Sandomir.
With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   DUPONT-PIONEER (Undated) _ Pioneer Hi-Bred International, the
world's largest producer of seed corn, and DuPont Co. announced
Friday that they were discussing a possible combination, raising
the prospect of a bidding war in the agriculture industry. By David
J. Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT (Moved in ``e'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PHILOSOPHY (Moscow) _ For 70 years, Russian philosophy
was Marxism-Leninism. It was more than a dusty schoolroom
requirement; it was the national religion, the source of the
state's political authority and legitimacy. But the collapse of the
USSR has brought freedom to the study of philosophy. This freedom
has pitched Russian philosophy both backward and forward. What
philosophical school is most popular now? ``What day is it?'' a
philosopher responded with a laugh. By Patricia Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   GASS-PROFILE (St. Louis) _ A profile of the novelist William
Gass, 74, one of the most respected writers never to write a best
seller, who has led a spirited attack on the traditional American
novel, denouncing plot as less important than form and language. By
Dee Wedemeyer. With photo.

resident aliens who have endorsed or contributed to Noraid, an
American support group for the Irish Republican Army. By Anthony
Lewis.

<P>
   BKC-EAST (Charlotte, N.C.) _ It was the region that couldn't
shoot straight Friday in a brutal afternoon of substandard
basketball at the East Regional of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament. None of the four teams competing shot
better than 40 percent and one, Wisconsin, scored only 32 points.
Then top-seeded Duke showed up Friday night. By Joe Drape.
</P>
<P>
   BKC-MIDWEST-II (New Orleans) _ Chagrined by his losing
performance in the Mid-American Conference tournament final, Miami
of Ohio's Wally Szczerbiak came into the Midwest Regional looking
to get the sour taste out of his mouth. He did so by keeping the
basketball in his own hands. The senior forward scored a
career-high 43 points in the Red Hawks' 59-58 victory over
Washington Friday in the Superdome. By Charlie Nobles.

CSUN'S DREAM SEASON HITS THE WALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT COLLINS, Colo. _ They almost pulled it off.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge women's basketball team, picked by no
one to even stay with Colorado State for even a half, put a scare
into the Rams before losing 71-59 Friday night in an NCAA Women's
Tournament first-round game at Moby Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The 15th-seeded Matadors (21-8), down by one at the half, held
on to a lead for most of the second half but unraveled in a
four-minute stretch late in the game when the second-seeded Rams
went on a 19-0 point run.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Cronin's two free throws gave Colorado State a 57-55 lead
with 3:50 left. At that point, it seemed like the Rams, who were
playing in the NCAA Tournament for the second consecutive season,
were a little too much for CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Johnson made a steal for the Rams just 10 seconds later,
and Cronin finished on the other end with an 8-footer to make it
59-55.
</P>
<P>
   Cronin wasn't finished. She nailed a 3-pointer with 2:20 left to
extend Colorado State's lead to 62-55.
</P>
<P>
   Edniesha Curry, the Matadors' emotional leader and best player,
picked up her third foul with 16:21 left. She didn't return until
the 10:39 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors picked up the pace without Curry. A steal and layup
with Jamilah Jones gave CSUN a 43-37 lead with 13:19 left. The lead
was 45-38 when Curry came back.
</P>
<P>
   The lead reached seven again, 53-46, with 6{ minutes left on
Vivica Lof's 18-footer.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan Colorado State crowd _ at an estimated 8,500, by
far the largest CSUN has played in front of this season _ was in
shock. The fans sat hushed through most of the first half as the
Matadors stayed ahead of the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN exploited the Rams' zone defense for four 3-pointers in the
first 20 minutes, including two by Lof, a 6-3 reserve center.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State, which was playing at home for the first time
since Feb. 20, was just 11 of 32 from the field (34 percent) in the
first half. The Rams, who didn't lead until Hammon made two free
throws with 3:33 minutes left that made it 25-24, missed 10 of 12
3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors stayed within a point (29-28) of the Rams at
halftime despite committing 14 turnovers and having the same amount
of rebounds, 19, as smaller Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, the second-leading scorer in the Big Sky, attempted _ and
made _ only one basket in the first half: a long 3-pointer that
gave CSUN a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, who led by as many as seven points in the game's
first 17 minutes, benefited from a shaky start by Hammon, who
missed her first shot _ a layup _ and turned the ball over on the
next Rams possession.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State missed 12 of its first 15 shots. Hammon was 3 of
10 in the first half. The poor shooting was reminiscent of the
Rams' the 24 percent (14 of 58) effort in a 65-49 loss to SMU in
the WAC Tournament final.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri State 72, UC Santa Barbara 70: Carly Deer
scored on a layup with 11 seconds left and the Bears (24-6) held on
to end the Gauchos' school-record 21-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Deer's basket came eight seconds after Erin Buescher gave UCSB
(26-4) a 70-69 lead.
</P>
<P>
   SMS sophomore guard Jackie Stiles, the nation's leading scorer
at 25.9 points per game and the Missouri Valley Conference MVP, was
held to 18 by the 10th-seeded Gauchos. Buescher scored a game-high
27 on 10-of-18 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   UCSB, which took an 11-0 lead before the Bears roared back with
a 14-2 run, played without former Simi Valley High standout Tawnee
Cooper, a junior guard.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper suffered a broken left leg and partially torn ACL five
weeks ago. At the time of the injury, she was third on the team in
scoring (12.3).

NEW-LOOK LAKERS BEAT WARRIORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Business transactions ceased and basketball
resumed Friday at the Forum, and the old Los Angeles Lakers mixed
with the new _ a bushel of imported talents, plucked from all
reaches of the NBA, from retirement homes in Chicago to broken
homes in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   At the helm, a new coach mixed and matched lineups and looked
for effective combinations as players tried on their new uniforms
and introduced themselves to one another.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA schedule said it was Game 22, but for the megamorphing
power Lakers, this was training camp all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for them, the opponent played like a team that
skipped training altogether, as the new-look Lakers rolled over the
Golden State Warriors 89-78.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad outing for a retooled Lakers team that has undergone
more facelifts than Joan Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   And with prettier results. But then, that was expected when the
Lakers acquired sharpshooter Glen Rice in Wednesday's trade with
Charlotte. The 21 shots he took showed his surgically repaired
elbow was sound, but the 13 shots he missed were clear evidence of
his 10-month layoff from basketball.
</P>
<P>
   And his game-high 21 points were simply an indicator of the
Lakers' future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tonight I was rusty,'' Rice confirmed. ``Everybody
kept asking me about my elbow. My elbow was fine, but my legs felt
like I was running in mud.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Rice missed all four of his 3-point attempts but shot
often enough to hurt the Warriors and keep them from corralling
Shaquille O'Neal (20 points) and Kobe Bryant (18).
</P>
<P>
   It all combined to give the Lakers their 10th straight win and
coach Kurt Rambis a record 9-0 start to his career. The fast start
ties the NBA record set by Buddy Jeannette of the Baltimore Bullets
in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means absolutely nothing to me,'' Rambis said dourly. More
impressive to him was Rice's resiliency after surgery and a
prolonged offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's amazing for someone to step in and do,'' Rambis said,
``to hit the shots he did and free throws and even get up and down
the court after having all that time off and he hasn't played.''
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Reid, packaged with Rice in the trade, made a smaller but
significant impression with six points, two rebounds, an assist and
a hustling backcourt steal in 17 minutes. He easily earned the time
behind Travis Knight and the Lakers' other recent import, Chicago
alumnus Dennis Rodman, who was quiet on this night because of elbow
soreness.
</P>
<P>
   Still recovering from the trade of Eddie Jones and Elden
Campbell and adjusting to all the new parts, the Lakers
nevertheless played like the title contenders they are billed to
be.
</P>
<P>
   They efficiently built a 21-point lead by halftime against the
improved Warriors and extended it to 75-52 by the end of three
quarters. The only downside were injuries to Rodman and Derek
Harper (sprained ankle) and a brief fourth-quarter slide.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers frittered their 23-point fourth-quarter lead,
allowing the Warriors to pull within 11 points. Rambis was forced
to send O'Neal back into the game with 6:33 left and a suddenly
shaky 14-point lead. Golden State faded after that.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to the big early lead, Rambis said. But as for the
adjusting to all the new faces, that transition appears to be
moving quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Game 1, right?'' Rick Fox said of the new mix.
``It's not a bad situation. What you saw out there was not a smooth
run, but it was a strong showing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox got the start at small forward, where Rice will eventually
be. Rice came in for Fox at the 3:57 mark in the first quarter and
was greeted warmly by the 17,505 in attendance. He started slowly,
missing his first three shots. But he started drawing fouls and
hitting free throws and found his shooting touch. Rice finished the
first half with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Reid scored four points in seven minutes in the first half and
snatched a steal in the backcourt that led to an easy O'Neal
basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time a team has to adjust to anything, there's gonna be
problems,'' Rambis said of the changes. ``You try to do the best
job you can whenever you have to make an adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Adjustments like this, they'll welcome.

   McNair vows sellouts &QL; 
if Houston gets NFL team &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN WILLIAMS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HOUSTON _ Houston businessman Bob McNair on Friday guaranteed
sellouts at every home game for five years should he get an NFL
expansion football team, a pledge that would prevent local
television blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual promise is aimed at gaining an upper hand over Los
Angeles, which has more than a 3-1 edge in the number of TV
households and is considered a better place for the league to
expand.
</P>
<P>
   However, network officials have said they would prefer that the
NFL be in a town that can guarantee sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm that confident we will succeed,'' McNair said. ``We're
telling television that you're not going to suffer blackouts in
Houston. That should be a big challenge to Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Two groups in Los Angeles are competing for a team. Hollywoo
dealmaker Michael Ovitz wants to build a new stadium in suburban
Carson atop a waste dump. Real estate developer Ed Roski and
billionaire Eli Broad want to remodel the L.A. Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   An official for Roski declined comment on McNair's pledge, other
than to say, ``Oh, my god.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials, preparing to gather in Phoenix on Sunday for a
meeting to decide which city will get an expansion team, declined
comment.
</P>
<P>
   One NFL official said the league would expect Houston to sell
out every home game during the first five years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, making such a pledge is very uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   McNair said he would devise a system to give to charity any
tickets not sold by the deadline for a blackout. Under NFL rules, a
game is not televised within 75 miles if not a sellout 72 hours
before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   McNair said giving the tickets to charity would cost him 34
percent of their face value, the percentage of gate receipts a home
team must pledge to the visiting team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could come at a cost to the team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Challenging Los Angeles' TV advantage has been a major goal of
McNair in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, he distributed a report to team owners
showing that while Los Angeles has a larger base of viewers who
watch NFL games, having a home team in that city does not produce a
large gain over having a new team in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Using network records for the 1993 and 1994 seasons, the
incremental gain of a Los Angeles Raiders game over the base was
only about 28,000 more than the incremental gain of a Houston
Oilers' game.
</P>
<P>
   Both cities lost their NFL franchises in 1995, with Los Angeles
also losing the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix this week, Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen told
Bloomberg News Service that many owners prefer Los Angeles because
of its TV market.
</P>
<P>
   But Bowlen, a member of the expansion and television committees,
said he doesn't believe ``Los Angeles is the no-brainer people are
making it out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any confidence that a stadium agreement is going
to get done by either Los Angeles group,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Los Angeles cannot solidify a stadium financing plan that
allows for play in 2002, Bowlen said he will throw his support to
Houston, where public financing, stadium design and ownership have
been decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the stadium isn't ready, there's nothing wrong with giving
Houston the expansion team, negotiating our own stadium agreement
in Los Angeles and later relocating a team there,'' Bowlen said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Texas' two U.S. senators and the region's seven House
members have sent NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue a letter asking
that he hold to his word.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three years ago, Tagliabue stood in Houston's City Hall
and said the city would likely get another football team if it put
together a state-of-the-art stadium deal.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the group _ led by Republican Sens. Phil Gramm and
Kay Bailey Hutchison _ implored the league to give Houston the 32nd
franchise over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The letter reminded Tagliabue of his comments May 29, 1996,
after meeting with Gramm, then-Mayor Bob Lanier, Harris County
Judge Robert Eckels and others in wake of the Oilers' departure for
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said he saw no reason why Houston could not have
another team within six years if a stadium financing plan were in
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly should be the objective,'' Tagliabue said.
``I've seen some suggestions that talk about 2002 or beyond, and I
think if we get to work and make this a priority, which is what we
committed to today, it can be done sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter said Houston's proposed $310 million,
retractable-roof stadium ``meets all the requirements set by you.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was also signed by U.S. Reps. Bill Archer, R-Houston;
Nick Lampson, D-Beaumont; Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land; Gene Green,
D-Houston; Kevin Brady, R-The Woodlands; Sheila Jackson Lee,
D-Houston; and Ken Bentsen, D-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials from California have not made a similar
lobbying effort on behalf of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Houston football market is tremendous, and NFL consultants
predict great fan interest in a franchise,'' the Texas letter said.

COLORADO STATE ENDS CSUN'S SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT COLLINS, Colo. _ It was a little after midnight here when
the dream dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge women's basketball team, given little
or no chance to beat heavily favored Colorado State, gave the Rams
a scare before losing 71-59 in the first round of the NCAA Women's
Tournament on Friday night at Moby Arena.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (21-8) saw its seven-game winning streak broken in its
first appearance in the tournament. Until the final five minutes,
the 15th-seeded Matadors looked like they would earn a
``SportsCenter'' highlight.
</P>
<P>
   With 5 minutes, 48 seconds left, CSUN led 55-48.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't tell until the last five minutes who was the No.
4 team in the country,'' CSUN guard Tina Greer said.
</P>
<P>
   But the glass slipper did not fit. It was the classic case of a
team with tournament experience, playing in front of a sellout
crowd of 8,741, doing what it had to do to advance. The
second-seeded Rams (31-2) went on a 19-0 run in a crucial five
minute stretch that made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coach Frozena Jerro said she was getting the feeling of an
upset just prior to the Rams' onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was getting to that point,'' she said. ``I couldn't let it
sink in too soon. I felt if we could hold on for a couple more
minutes, we would have a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State relied on its two standout seniors _ Becky Hammon
and Katie Cronin _ to pull out the Rams' 20th-consecutive home win.
Even though they combined to make just eight of 25 shots, the combo
of Hammon and Cronin was responsible for the Rams' final 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every huddle, it was like `We are not losing this,''' said
Hammon, an All-American who finished with a game-high 27. ``I'd
rather have a momentum shift in the last two minutes than in the
first 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Edniesha Curry, the Matadors' emotional leader and best player,
picked up her third foul with 16:21 left. She didn't return until
the 10:39 mark.
</P>
<P>
   But the Matadors extended the lead without Curry. A steal and
layup by Jamilah Jones gave CSUN a 43-37 lead with 13:19 left. The
lead was 45-38 when Curry came back.
</P>
<P>
   The lead reached seven again, 53-46, with 6{ minutes left on
Vivica Lof's 18-footer.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan Colorado State crowd _ by far the largest CSUN has
played in front of this season _ was in shock. The fans sat hushed
through most of the first half as the Matadors stayed ahead of the
Rams.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN exploited the Rams' zone defense for four 3-pointers in the
first 20 minutes, including two by Lof, a 6-3 reserve center who
scored a team-high 12. The Rams, who were playing at home for the
first time since Feb. 20, were just 11 of 32 from the field (34
percent) in the first half. They didn't lead until Hammon made a
pair of free throws with 3:33 left that made it 25-24, missed 10 of
12 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors stayed within a point (29-28) of the Rams at
halftime despite committing 14 turnovers and having the same number
of rebounds, 19, as the smaller Rams. For the game, CSUN
outrebounded Colorado State 41-37.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, the second-leading scorer in the Big Sky, attempted _ and
made _ only one basket in the first half: a long 3-pointer that
gave CSUN a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, who led by as many as seven points in the game's
first 17 minutes, benefited from a shaky start by Hammon, who
missed her first shot _ a layup _ and turned the ball over on the
next Rams possession.
</P>
<P>
   CSU missed 12 of its first 15 shots. Hammon was 3 of 10 in the
first half. The poor shooting was reminiscent of the Rams' the 24
percent (14 of 58) effort in a 65-49 loss to SMU in the WAC
Tournament final.

   DOGS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In cities and towns across the
nation, a chorus of politically influential voices cries out in
unison: Woof! From leash laws to legislation to curb dangerous
animals to regulations limiting the number of dogs per household,
canine questions are the new hot button of local politics. By
Douglas Martin. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   ESPIONAGE-DIPLOMACY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Although the Chinese
nuclear spying scandal may have a big impact on U.S. politics, it
is not likely to have a significant effect on U.S. diplomacy with
China. Espionage is largely separate from mainstream foreign
policy, and, after all, all countries spy on each other. By Tim
Weiner. (`i' category)

<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   MARS-LIFE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Science is toying quietly with the
notion that life on Earth evolved from microbes that arrived here
from Mars. That may sound goofy. But supporting evidence, if
sketchy, has been growing steadily for a decade. By William Broad.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-DOLE-REVIEW (Des Moines) _ For all their individual
accomplishments, Elizabeth Dole and George W. Bush would not be
such hot tickets were it not for their pedigrees. But by distancing
themselves from their famous family members, they demonstrate the
complications _ the drawbacks as well as advantages _ of belonging
to political dynasties. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   WHITE-HOUSE-PSYCH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some political
psychologists and political scientists recommend the appointment of
a White House shrink on call for presidents, their families and
senior staff members. The presidency is too important a job to be
deprived of easy access to professional psychological support. By
David Wallis.
</P>
<P>
   CADILLAC-RACING-REVIEW (Detroit) _ A look at the off-beat _ and
sometimes off-key _ efforts to build a new, sprier reputation for
Cadillac. The latest: Cadillac is building a race car to compete
next year at Le Mans, the venerable French race in which entrants
try to drive as many times around a track as possible in 24 hours.
By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   LABOR-CORRUPTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the difficulties
at ferreting out corruption among labor union leaders. One reason
that some union leaders have been able to jack up their salaries to
excessive levels is that it is often hard for members to find out
exactly what those salaries are. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   JOB-TITLES-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Clinton administration may
have reinvented the federal work force by cutting nearly 400,000
lower-level jobs, but it has also reinforced an already top-heavy
bureaucracy with more layers of lavishly titled upper-level
officials. By Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK-INTERVIEW-REVIEW (Undated) _ Excerpts from a 1987
interview with Stanley Kubrick show that the reclusive filmmaker
was a man of colorful quotes.
</P>
<P>
   DIMAGGIO-INTERVIEW-REVIEW (Undated) _ Excerpts from interviews
with Joe DiMaggio indicate that the celebrity baseball hero was not
a man of colorful quotes.

   DETROIT _ Mention Cadillac, and the images that spring to mind
are pretty sedate: Midwestern grandfathers tooling down suburban
roads, perhaps, or chauffeurs in caps holding rear doors open for
wealthy widows carrying sculpted poodles out of Fifth Avenue
co-ops.
</P>
<P>
   These are precisely the images Cadillac is trying to change. The
result has been a series of offbeat _ and sometimes off-key _
efforts to build a new, sprier reputation for Cadillac. The latest:
Cadillac is building a race car to compete next year at Le Mans,
the venerable French race in which entrants try to drive as many
times around a track as possible in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Fire-engine red is a popular color for race cars, but Cadillac
will stick to its heritage by painting its entry a shimmery
platinum hue. Still, some compromises are being made. To defray the
cost, Cadillac will allow other sponsors to put their logos on the
car, although Cadillac will insist that they not be gaudy. And
while the rules at Le Mans require that the race cars have two
seats, the Cadillac entry will definitely not include a chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that Le Mans cars must fit two people, but they fit
side by side, not one in the back seat,'' said John F. Smith,
Cadillac's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's corporate parent, General Motors, believes the move
makes sense. After largely ignoring the overseas market for luxury
cars for nearly a century, GM has decided it must fight back
against BMW, Mercedes, Lexus and other rivals by invading their
home markets. GM is trying to establish Cadillac as a global brand,
and while prosperous Americans may not pay much attention to events
like the Indianapolis 500, affluent car buyers in Japan and Europe
do tend to watch car races.
</P>
<P>
   Auto racing enthusiasts were nonetheless amused that Cadillac
chose to trumpet its race car plans with an announcement that
began, ``50 years later, Cadillac returns to Le Mans.'' Unlike many
automakers, Cadillac does not have a racing tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Two Cadillacs did compete at Le Mans in 1950, and did remarkably
well, beating cars from racing giants like MG, Jaguar and Ferrari.
But both Cadillacs were entered by a wealthy businessman, not by
the manufacturer. For many years, auto racing ``was something the
standard of the world just didn't do,'' said Robert Casey, an auto
historian. ``They didn't need to; they had the North American
market nailed down.'' Cadillac anointed itself as the standard of
the world after winning a much-contested trophy for automotive
design from Britain's Royal Automobile Club in 1908, and has
periodically used the slogan since then in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Many other auto manufacturers have genuine racing traditions.
Henry Ford raised the money to start Ford Motor Co. by building a
low, rakish car that won an important car race near Detroit in
1902. Ford did not actually drive the car, instead hiring a
daredevil bicyclist, Barney Oldfield, who learned to drive in the
week before the race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1904, with his company struggling against dozens of other
tiny automakers, Ford took a hand-built car out onto the fissured
ice of a lake near Detroit and personally drove it faster than
anyone had ever driven: a little over 91 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's feat was never officially recognized as a record. Land
speed records are calculated from a driver's average speed in two
runs across the same terrain with the second run in the opposite
direction to eliminate wind as a factor. Ford, having barely made
it across the rough ice in his first run, never went back. ``He
didn't care; it was worth it for the advertising,'' Casey said.
``He figured if you go faster than anyone else, you have the
record.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Honda has built its reputation for good-quality
cars and high-technology engines on its many years of racing
experience. Working in Honda's racing division is still essential
to executive success at the Japanese automaker, where the new V6
engine in the Honda Accord was designed by Katsumi Ichida, an
engineer whose previous assignment involved building race car
engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in it to develop the people, the engineers,'' said
Thomas Elliott, Honda's executive vice president of North American
auto operations.
</P>
<P>
   Engines win and lose car races, and Cadillac believes that its
V8 Northstar, which has gotten good reviews from experts, can be
the reliable, high-performance engine it needs to compete at Le
Mans. But the engine will undergo so many modifications for racing
that it will become unrecognizable even to some mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadillac race car looks a little like a graying Batmobile,
judging from drawings released last week. But in a bid to enhance
future sales, GM designed the car to resemble the Cadillac Evoq, a
prototype coupe that Cadillac is displaying at auto shows this year
and is likely to begin selling in several years. The Evoq and the
race car are painted in a new platinum-colored paint that seems to
change from light to dark and back again depending on the
illumination and the angle from which it is viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac needs all the help it can get. Lincoln nearly outsold
it in the United States last year for the first time in more than
half a century. And some of Cadillac's attempts to change its image
have been failures.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac tried two years ago to woo professional women in their
40s by running television advertisements showing model Cindy
Crawford wearing knee-high boots and a tight, leather mini-dress as
she drove a new Cadillac past the stone walls of a castle. Adweek
described her outfit as a ``Wilma Flintstone-as-dominatrix
get-up,'' and the ads were soon pulled.
</P>
<P>
   But expanding Cadillac's tiny business overseas will be a fresh
start for an aging brand, and Cadillac hopes racing will help it
get off to a fast start abroad. While Americans may have strong
ideas about what a Cadillac is, Smith said, ``Europe and Japan are
a clean sheet of paper.''

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For all the railing of unions about income
inequality, some labor leaders don't seem to take the issue too
seriously when it hits close to home.
</P>
<P>
   Take Gus Bevona, the longtime president of a New York City
janitors' local who made $531,529 in 1997. That's 17 times what his
union's members earned on average. Or take Frank Wsol, head of a
teamsters local in Chicago, who was paid $473,069.
</P>
<P>
   These salaries may be small compared to what Bill Gates or
Michael Eisner make, but they are surprisingly high in a field
where people become leaders, at least in theory, because they are
more interested in raising their members' incomes than in raising
their own.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason some union leaders have been able to jack up
their salaries is that it is often hard for members to find out
what their leaders are paid. Many times, union leaders have their
salaries increased at sparsely attended board meetings, and
afterward they do little to broadcast the news, knowing it would
hurt their re-election chances. Until recently, often the only way
union members could find out how much their leaders earned was to
go or write to an office of the U.S. Department of Labor to ask to
see a bare-bones financial report that every parent union and local
must file annually.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, union members _ or members of the public _ wanting
to know how much a labor leader earned must request a form known as
an LM-2 for that leader's union. But there are complications that
make this process as hard as doing a jigsaw puzzle. It is often
necessary to track down an array of forms to get the whole picture.
A union official may be paid separately as president of a local,
president of a citywide joint council and board member of the
parent union.
</P>
<P>
   For example, to figure out Bevona's salary, union members must
go first to the Labor Department's Office of Labor-Management
Standards in lower Manhattan. There, they must ask for the LM-2
form for Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International
Union, Bevona's local, which represents 55,000 janitors and
doormen. The report shows the local paid him $365,401 in 1997 _ the
most recent year for which a report was filed.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be wrong to stop there. Bevona also served as
president of a related local, Local 32B-32J-144, representing
22,000 home health-care aides who assist the elderly and disabled.
The LM-2 for that local reveals that Bevona received an additional
$86,128. That raised his income to $451,529.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most intrepid union members might stop their search
right there, but Bevona was also a board member of the
Washington-based parent union. To determine how much he earned for
that post, it is necessary to ask the Labor Department's main
office in Washington for the parent union's LM-2. That form shows
that Bevona received an additional $80,000 for being on that board.
Voila, his 1997 income totaled $531,529.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department has recently made it easier to obtain LM-2
forms by requesting them through the Internet at
(www.dol.gov/dol/esa/public/regs/compliance/olms/rrlo/ordern.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Bevona's unusual salary and the marble-lined penthouse apartment
he had built atop union headquarters were among the reasons his
parent union pressured him to take early retirement in February.
</P>
<P>
   Upset that so many teamster leaders belong to what it calls the
$100,000 club, a dissident group called Teamsters for a Democratic
Union has begun collecting LM-2 forms for every teamster local. The
group has published what it found. Thus it became known that Wsol
received $428,745 from Local 710 in 1997 as well as $44,324 for his
work as vice president of Teamsters Joint Council 25 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to have an organization that makes a point of getting
these documents,'' said Ken Paff, national coordinator of Teamsters
for a Democratic Union. ``Ever since the 1980s when we really began
publicizing the members of the $100,000 club, the number of
teamster leaders earning that much has declined steadily.''
</P>
<P>
   But even LM-2 forms tell only a little of the story. When Bevona
retired, he stunned members by walking away with $1.5 million _
$850,000 in a lump sum severance payment and $650,000 in unused
vacation time. There was no mention of those accrued liabilities in
the LM-2 forms filed by Bevona's local, even in the lines where the
union was asked to list liabilities. And members who wanted to
learn details about Bevona's penthouse could learn nothing from the
financial reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``When unions file these forms with the government, they should
be required to list information like how large a pension a union
leader is due and how much vacation time they are owed,'' said
Herman Benson, founder of the Association for Union Democracy, a
Brooklyn-based nonprofit watchdog group. ``That way members would
know if something outrageous is developing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many union members complain that most unions representing
government employees are exempt from the requirement to file LM-2
forms. Benson's group and many union members are lobbying for
legislation that would require such disclosure by government
employee unions.
</P>
<P>
   Some disgruntled union members also want the AFL-CIO to publish
guidelines on how much union leaders should earn. It makes no
sense, they say, for Wsol to earn more than twice as much as
AFL-CIO president John Sweeney or for Bevona to earn five times as
much as Dennis Rivera, president of a New York hospital workers'

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For all the railing of unions about income
inequality, some labor leaders don't seem to take the issue too
seriously when it hits close to home.
</P>
<P>
   Take Gus Bevona, the longtime president of a New York City
janitors' local who made $531,529 in 1997. That's 17 times what his
union's members earned on average. Or take Frank Wsol, head of a
teamsters local in Chicago, who was paid $473,069.
</P>
<P>
   These salaries may be small compared to what Bill Gates or
Michael Eisner make, but they are surprisingly high in a field
where people become leaders, at least in theory, because they are
more interested in raising their members' incomes than in raising
their own.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason some union leaders have been able to jack up
their salaries is that it is often hard for members to find out
what their leaders are paid. Many times, union leaders have their
salaries increased at sparsely attended board meetings, and
afterward they do little to broadcast the news, knowing it would
hurt their re-election chances. Until recently, often the only way
union members could find out how much their leaders earned was to
go or write to an office of the U.S. Department of Labor to ask to
see a bare-bones financial report that every parent union and local
must file annually.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, union members _ or members of the public _ wanting
to know how much a labor leader earned must request a form known as
an LM-2 for that leader's union. But there are complications that
make this process as hard as doing a jigsaw puzzle. It is often
necessary to track down an array of forms to get the whole picture.
A union official may be paid separately as president of a local,
president of a citywide joint council and board member of the
parent union.
</P>
<P>
   For example, to figure out Bevona's salary, union members must
go first to the Labor Department's Office of Labor-Management
Standards in lower Manhattan. There, they must ask for the LM-2
form for Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International
Union, Bevona's local, which represents 55,000 janitors and
doormen. The report shows the local paid him $365,401 in 1997 _ the
most recent year for which a report was filed.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be wrong to stop there. Bevona also served as
president of a related local, Local 32B-32J-144, representing
22,000 home health-care aides who assist the elderly and disabled.
The LM-2 for that local reveals that Bevona received an additional
$86,128. That raised his income to $451,529.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most intrepid union members might stop their search
right there, but Bevona was also a board member of the
Washington-based parent union. To determine how much he earned for
that post, it is necessary to ask the Labor Department's main
office in Washington for the parent union's LM-2. That form shows
that Bevona received an additional $80,000 for being on that board.
Voila, his 1997 income totaled $531,529.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department has recently made it easier to obtain LM-2
forms by requesting them through the Internet at
(www.dol.gov/dol/esa/public/regs/compliance/olms/rrlo/ordern.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Bevona's unusual salary and the marble-lined penthouse apartment
he had built atop union headquarters were among the reasons his
parent union pressured him to take early retirement in February.
</P>
<P>
   Upset that so many teamster leaders belong to what it calls the
$100,000 club, a dissident group called Teamsters for a Democratic
Union has begun collecting LM-2 forms for every teamster local. The
group has published what it found. Thus it became known that Wsol
received $428,745 from Local 710 in 1997 as well as $44,324 for his
work as vice president of Teamsters Joint Council 25 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to have an organization that makes a point of getting
these documents,'' said Ken Paff, national coordinator of Teamsters
for a Democratic Union. ``Ever since the 1980s when we really began
publicizing the members of the $100,000 club, the number of
teamster leaders earning that much has declined steadily.''
</P>
<P>
   But even LM-2 forms tell only a little of the story. When Bevona
retired, he stunned members by walking away with $1.5 million _
$850,000 in a lump sum severance payment and $650,000 in unused
vacation time. There was no mention of those accrued liabilities in
the LM-2 forms filed by Bevona's local, even in the lines where the
union was asked to list liabilities. And members who wanted to
learn details about Bevona's penthouse could learn nothing from the
financial reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``When unions file these forms with the government, they should
be required to list information like how large a pension a union
leader is due and how much vacation time they are owed,'' said
Herman Benson, founder of the Association for Union Democracy, a
Brooklyn-based nonprofit watchdog group. ``That way members would
know if something outrageous is developing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many union members complain that most unions representing
government employees are exempt from the requirement to file LM-2
forms. Benson's group and many union members are lobbying for
legislation that would require such disclosure by government
employee unions.
</P>
<P>
   Some disgruntled union members also want the AFL-CIO to publish
guidelines on how much union leaders should earn. It makes no
sense, they say, for Wsol to earn more than twice as much as
AFL-CIO president John Sweeney or for Bevona to earn five times as
much as Dennis Rivera, president of a New York hospital workers'
union with more than double the membership of Bevona's local
</P>
<P>
   ``These guidelines,'' Benson said, ``would be a real moral boost
for the labor movement and might save it a lot of embarrassment.''

   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration may have reinvented the
federal work force by cutting nearly 400,000 lower-level jobs, but
it has also reinforced an already top-heavy bureaucracy with more
layers of lavishly titled officials in the upper ranks of the
government, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the study, by Paul Light of the Brookings Institution,
concluded that the administration has created as many new job
titles among the government's higher tiers in the last six years as
the seven prior administrations did over 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the newer positions include deputy to the deputy
secretary, principal assistant deputy undersecretary and associate
principal deputy assistant secretary. Any given department may have
only one of the new positions, but experience suggests that they
will spread.
</P>
<P>
   Titles that have already spread like kudzu through the agencies
since 1960 include deputy assistant secretaries (484), associate
assistant secretaries (148), assistant assistant secretaries (220)
and deputy assistant assistant secretaries (82).
</P>
<P>
   And a handful of officials hold titles like associate deputy
assistant secretary, chief of staff to the associate assistant
secretary, chief of staff to the assistant assistant secretary and
principal deputy to the deputy assistant secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive growth of such jobs may help the self-esteem of
some officials and their bosses, but it has also contributed to
significant paper shuffling and delays in decision making, the
study says.
</P>
<P>
   The titles have been part of a six-year management overhaul by
the White House that has eliminated many of the more important
lower-level jobs and contracted them out to private companies. As a
result, people have found it harder to reach federal employees when
they call or write the government, and top officials have become
more insulated from the needs of the people and the issues that
affect them, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got here two months ago, and I've been saying, I've got
to have a chief of staff,'' Light said. ``That person would be
chief of staff to the senior fellow. But I won't really be somebody
until I have a deputy chief of staff.''

   BERLIN _ The butcher, a florid man, was blunt about the
situation: ``Keine Puten'' _ ``No turkeys.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement might have seemed reasonable enough were it not
for several factors: The date was Dec. 24, the bird had been
ordered and paid for, a long line of solid German burghers with
similar orders for Christmas turkeys stood behind me, and Germany
has no recent recorded history of turkey shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the butcher insisted, with growing obstinacy, ``Keine
Puten.'' An explanation, of sorts, followed. A computer glitch. A
truckful of fowl erroneously sent to an unknown destination. The
impossibility of finding the truck in the sprawling Berlin area.
The absence of an alternative source of turkey in a city of 3.5
million people
</P>
<P>
   I expected a small uprising in the store, perhaps even a
revolution. Dozens of turkeys had been bought, their stuffings
readied _ only to disappear into an unfathomable void on the eve of
the party. Perhaps, I mused, foul play had seen the hapless birds
smuggled into nearby Poland, whose border with Germany has become a
haven for contraband.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the explanation, the turkey dearth seemed scandalous.
But not, apparently, to my fellow shoppers. A few murmurings could
be heard, sober calls on mobile phones to spouses, brief
discussions with the butcher, and then the apparently contented
acquisition of various yuletide alternatives _ duck, filet of pork,
even large slabs of rumpsteak.
</P>
<P>
   Call this Meine Keineputenangst. I had always imagined that the
uniquely reassuring clunk of a Mercedes door closing _ the hermetic
union of perfect parts _ was the fruit of a society that prized
precision and efficiency. In their blindest manifestations, these
qualities had taken Germany down the darkest of roads. But they had
also created the finely balanced political institutions and
machines whose success raised the country from postwar ruin in
stunningly short order.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what sort of efficiency was it that left Bachhuber of
Wilmersdorf, one of Berlin's best-known butchers, without turkeys
to honor its orders on the day before Christmas? And what sort of
society was it that accepted this ghastly contretemps with such
equanimity that not a voice was raised?
</P>
<P>
   A society, it seemed, that was anything but settled. For the
first image was startlingly ``un-German.'' It suggested, if
anything, a flakiness that Germans tend to associate with societies
south of the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   The second image, however, seemed quintessentially German, that
of a society terrified of disorder, wary of disruption; a people
still asking itself, at some subliminal level: ``Can we ever be
trusted again?''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it seems, that is Germany today, a place pulled
between two poles. This polarity challenges the new government of
the Social Democratic chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder. His Cabinet
ministers are very much of Germany's Latin-leaning, postwar
generation, with their houses in Tuscany, their taste for olive oil
rather than lard, for wine rather than beer, for bear hugs rather
than formal handshakes. Theirs is a Germany that is less formal,
more multicultural, more forward-looking and, yes, less reliable in
the sense that it is no longer content with its postwar role as
economic giant and political pygmy.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, an older Germany persists: that of
deep-seated angst, of tremendous formality, of people who will not
cross even empty streets if the pedestrian light is red, of
handshakes of such bone-crushing harshness they speak of
estrangement rather than closeness. A Germany of obedience to
authority, of rigidity and order and Herr-This and Frau-That and
strictly no first names.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Germany for which a voice raised threatens disorder,
and Schroeder's proposed reform offering German citizenship to many
foreigners is a potent threat to be resisted with vigor.
</P>
<P>
   I was recently directed from an airport bus to the rear door of
a Boeing 737 on a flight from Munich. Due to a misunderstanding,
the door was closed. We waited on the stairs in the cold winter
air. Minutes passed. Nobody was prepared to knock on the door.
Nobody was ready to raise a voice. Disconcerted paralysis
prevailed. This, I thought, is still a society that values order
above freedom.

</P>
<P>
   But a few weeks later, I find myself with Joschka Fischer, the
foreign minister from the environmentalist Green Party, a former
1960s revolutionary, watching his face twist into a wry grin as he
considers his delicious destiny: moving the Foreign Ministry later
this year into Hitler's former Reichsbank in Berlin, a place where
East Germany's Communist leader, Erich Honecker, also held court.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer's is a Germany confident that history's lessons have
been learned, one that assumes the past but is not consumed by it,
one that feels it has earned the freedom to be bolder. A society
prepared to take the risk of moving its capital from Bonn back to
Berlin, the city where Bismarck's Reich ended in the humiliation of
World War I defeat and the punishment of Versailles, where the
Weimar Republic ended with Hitler, and where Hitler ended with
ruin. ``No devil lurks in Berlin,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Between these often contradictory images _ of caution and
risk-taking _ Germany now makes its way. It is today a place that
tends to shatter preconceptions. Take the autobahn system: the
stock images that arise are of magnificent highways full of
flashing BMW's and Mercedes and Porsches roaring along without a
speed limit to encumber them.
</P>
<P>
   Try this instead: a labyrinth of roadworks filled with cars
crawling along in 30-mile-long bottlenecks or breaking suddenly
from high speeds to negotiate diversions consisting of impossibly
narrow lanes. Of the 7,085 miles of autobahn in Germany, about
one-tenth is currently in the midst of construction or repairs. In
other words, it is rare to drive more than 10 miles without
encountering some sort of obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   What this reflects above all, of course, is the fact that
unification is still a work in progress 10 years after the fall of
the Berlin Wall; much remains to be done to connect the country and
make it whole. Germany, in short, is in the midst of change more
dramatic than in any other west European country.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff Olins, a London-based public relations agency, recently
put on a show in Berlin on the ``rebranding'' of Germany. Nations,
it seems, must also be brands today, capable of selling themselves
aggressively. The Berlin show was an exercise akin to the agency's
``rebranding'' of Tony Blair's Britain as a mecca of hip fashion
rather than the home of quaint old fogies. In the case of Germany,
too, the results were interesting.
</P>
<P>
   There was a postage stamp featuring model Claudia Schiffer. A
redesigned flag of red, yellow and blue _ all primary colors _
rather than the current black, gold and red (``Black is simply
negative,'' said Paul Vinogradoff of Wolff Olins). A photograph of
a pot of Nivea cream (Nivea is a German invention), with the
provocative caption, ``So smooth it must be French.'' Images of the
annual Berlin Love Parade, now the largest street party in the
world.
</P>

 BERLIN: above freedom.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a few weeks later, I find myself with Joschka Fischer, the
foreign minister from the environmentalist Green Party, a former
1960s revolutionary, watching his face twist into a wry grin as he
considers his delicious destiny: moving the Foreign Ministry later
this year into Hitler's former Reichsbank in Berlin, a place where
East Germany's Communist leader, Erich Honecker, also held court.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer's is a Germany confident that history's lessons have
been learned, one that assumes the past but is not consumed by it,
one that feels it has earned the freedom to be bolder. A society
prepared to take the risk of moving its capital from Bonn back to
Berlin, the city where Bismarck's Reich ended in the humiliation of
World War I defeat and the punishment of Versailles, where the
Weimar Republic ended with Hitler, and where Hitler ended with
ruin. ``No devil lurks in Berlin,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Between these often contradictory images _ of caution and
risk-taking _ Germany now makes its way. It is today a place that
tends to shatter preconceptions. Take the autobahn system: the
stock images that arise are of magnificent highways full of
flashing BMW's and Mercedes and Porsches roaring along without a
speed limit to encumber them.
</P>
<P>
   Try this instead: a labyrinth of roadworks filled with cars
crawling along in 30-mile-long bottlenecks or breaking suddenly
from high speeds to negotiate diversions consisting of impossibly
narrow lanes. Of the 7,085 miles of autobahn in Germany, about
one-tenth is currently in the midst of construction or repairs. In
other words, it is rare to drive more than 10 miles without
encountering some sort of obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   What this reflects above all, of course, is the fact that
unification is still a work in progress 10 years after the fall of
the Berlin Wall; much remains to be done to connect the country and
make it whole. Germany, in short, is in the midst of change more
dramatic than in any other west European country.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff Olins, a London-based public relations agency, recently
put on a show in Berlin on the ``rebranding'' of Germany. Nations,
it seems, must also be brands today, capable of selling themselves
aggressively. The Berlin show was an exercise akin to the agency's
``rebranding'' of Tony Blair's Britain as a mecca of hip fashion
rather than the home of quaint old fogies. In the case of Germany,
too, the results were interesting.
</P>
<P>
   There was a postage stamp featuring model Claudia Schiffer. A
redesigned flag of red, yellow and blue _ all primary colors _
rather than the current black, gold and red (``Black is simply
negative,'' said Paul Vinogradoff of Wolff Olins). A photograph of
a pot of Nivea cream (Nivea is a German invention), with the
provocative caption, ``So smooth it must be French.'' Images of the
annual Berlin Love Parade, now the largest street party in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show that Germany can now present itself as a
place where diversity is celebrated, where people are loosening up,
where efficiency is anything but the whole story,'' Vinogradoff
said. The ``safe,'' ``conformist,'' ``perfectionist'' Germany of
today could, with the right encouragement, give way to a ``free,''
``flexible,'' ``relaxed'' and ``spontaneous'' place.
</P>

   Perhaps. Some sort of transition is evidently under way. Germany

   Don't Look Too Far
</P>
<P>
   Those unschooled in the nuances of presidential candidates'
announcements and exploratory committees may picture experts
huddled around a table deliberating whether their candidate should
take the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiling his 10-member exploratory panel last week, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush said he was ``grateful they will take time to help
me make this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush exploratory committee has no immediate plans to
meet. What's to explore? The governor himself said he would back
out only if his candidacy were greeted with ``a large thud.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole did not disclose her committee members' names
last week because there aren't any. ``That's a legalism,''
explained Mrs. Dole's senior strategist, Kieran Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   By registering an exploratory committee with the Federal
Election Commission, contenders can begin collecting money for
travel and early organizational efforts. But it is not required;
candidates could just as easily create full-fledged campaign
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Why do many hopefuls maintain the fiction that they are
exploring when there is little doubt of their intentions? If their
campaigns collapse early, they can make a graceful exit, saying
that _ technically _ they were never in the race. And why announce
in one grand event if you can build the drama?
</P>
<P>
   As one Federal Election Commission official put it, ``A lot of
this is going through the hoops just for the political mileage.''

</P>
<P>
   It took only hours for William Ivey, chairman of the National
Endowment for the Arts, to decide about a $15,000 grant the agency
had authorized for a small Texas publisher to translate an unusual
children's book.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``The Story of Colors,'' was written by Subcomandante
Marcos, the leader of the Zapatista rebels in southern Mexico. The
inside flap shows him in full military regalia.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey took over in mid-1998 after the agency narrowly survived
attempts by House Republicans to extinguish it. Less than a day
after a reporter's phone call brought the book to his attention,
Ivey canceled the grant.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book had passed through a yearlong review process,
Ivey used his powers to reject the grant by fiat because he was
worried that some federal funds might make their way to the rebel
group. ``I looked at the movement of money internationally and saw
our inability to know what the ultimate destination might be,''
Ivey said.
</P>
<P>
   The move was a shock to Bobby Byrd, a poet and editor who runs
the Cinco Puntos Press in El Paso, Texas, with his wife and
daughter. Byrd said there was no chance Subcomandante Marcos would
receive any federal money because he had waived his rights to
income from the book.
</P>
<P>
   The book, first published by a small Mexican press in 1997, is a
folk tale about mythical gods who created colors to liven up a dull
gray universe. The Lannan Foundation in Santa Fe, N.M., said it
would donate funds to Byrd's press to make up for the lost grant.

   This Old House: Fallingapart
</P>
<P>
   Fallingwater, the Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece, ``represents
all the aspirations of the 20th century,'' says Lynda Waggoner, the
house's director. Unfortunately, it can also serve as a tidy
metaphor for a century that, for all its glories, has, well, had
its problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, for all his towering vision, was notorious for
neglecting the basics _ like designing roofs that wouldn't leak.
When Fallingwater was being built in western Pennsylvania six
decades ago, the contractor suggested more steel reinforcing for
those dramatic slabs hovering above the waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   But no one _ no one _ was allowed to tell the great architect
what to do, and Wright threatened to walk off the project. The
contractor quietly doubled the reinforcing anyway _ ``the building
probably would not be standing today'' if he hadn't, Ms. Waggoner
said. But even that wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   For Fallingwater is _ oh, it's no use resisting the tailormade
wordplay _ slowly falling into the water. The contractor was right:
The concrete is gradually bending, with one corner of the house 7
inches lower than it should be. The exterior is now adorned with
distinctly un-Wright-like steel beams to keep the whole thing from
collapsing. These will stay until there's a permanent solution.

   NATO Expands East to Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War receded a bit farther following a ceremony in
Independence, Mo., in which Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic
became the first former Soviet-bloc nations to formally join NATO.
At the gathering at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the foreign ministers of
the three nations, ``You are truly allies, you are truly home.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministers said their countries saw membership in the
alliance as an assurance of security and a return to their rightful
place in Europe. The enlargement of NATO from 16 to 19 members has
been one of the Clinton administration's top foreign policy goals.

   Clinton Tours Central America
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton journeyed to Central America on a mission of
mercy and regret. In Nicaragua and Honduras, he viewed the damage
from last fall's Hurricane Mitch and promised to do what he could
to pry loose $1 billion in reconstruction aid from Congress. He
also said he would try to ease the plight of thousands of Central
Americans who illegally migrated to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Guatemala, Clinton apologized for the U.S. support of the
nation's military rulers during their 36-year war against Marxist
insurgents and Mayan Indians, which left an estimated 200,000 dead.

   Curbs on Antibiotics in Feed
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration is revising its guidelines for
approving and monitoring antibiotics for animals, fearing that the
routine use of antibiotics in livestock feed to promote growth may
threaten human health by fostering bacteria that no drug can kill.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is acting now because the nation is especially
vulnerable: No new classes of antibiotics will be marketed in the
near future, and doctors fear that if bacteria overwhelm existing
drugs, more patients will succumb to untreatable infections.

   Former French Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and a member of his

negligence in the deaths of hundreds of transfusion patients who
contracted AIDS from contaminated blood in the mid-1980s.

<P>
   Fabius, now speaker of the lower house of Parliament, and
Georgina Dufoix, minister of social affairs in Fabius' Socialist

supplies for the AIDS virus mandatory from Aug. 1, 1985, a special
high court ruled.

<P>
   Edmond Herve, health minister at the time, was convicted of two
cases of negligence, but was given no sentence. The court said he
should have ordered the recall of previously untested blood when
the risk of potential contamination first became known, rather than
let it be used for several more months.

   NCAA Rule Is Voided
</P>
<P>
   A federal court in Philadelphia discarded the National
Collegiate Athletic Association's minimum test score requirement
for athletic scholarships. The court found that the requirement
``has an unjustified disparate impact against African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a significant comment on the debate over cultural bias in
standardized test. For the moment, the NCAA has no clear standard
for scholarship eligibility, and has asked for a stay of the
ruling.

   Intel Corp. settled an antitrust case brought by the government
just before the trial was to begin, agreeing not to force computer
manufacturers that need crucial technical information about the
company's microprocessor chips to surrender rival technology.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers said they were pleased by the settlement but
were continuing a broader antitrust investigation of Intel.

   Crumbling under the strain of debt and the specter of fresh
lawsuits over smoking, RJR Nabisco said it would separate its food
and tobacco businesses and sell its international tobacco division.
The company's biggest shareholder, Carl Icahn, said he would wage a
proxy fight to get RJR to spin off its Nabisco holdings instead of
the domestic tobacco operations, as the company proposed.

   Verdicts in French AIDS Case
</P>
<P>
   Former French Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and a member of his
Cabinet were acquitted of charges of criminal manslaughter and
negligence in the deaths of hundreds of transfusion patients who
contracted AIDS from contaminated blood in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Fabius, now speaker of the lower house of Parliament, and
Georgina Dufoix, minister of social affairs in Fabius' Socialist
government, acted as fast as they could to make testing of blood
supplies for the AIDS virus mandatory from Aug. 1, 1985, a special
high court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Edmond Herve, health minister at the time, was convicted of two
cases of negligence, but was given no sentence. The court said he
should have ordered the recall of previously untested blood when
the risk of potential contamination first became known, rather than
let it be used for several more months.

   Crayola Changes Stripes
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a few simple strokes can hint at the sweep of history
_ strokes of a crayon, say. Only twice in 96 years had Crayola
changed a color's name, rechristening ``Prussian blue'' as
``midnight blue'' in 1958 because people had lost track of exactly
what Prussia was, and changing ``flesh'' to ``peach'' in 1962,
recognizing that flesh is a many-colored thing.
</P>
<P>
   Now it will relabel ``indian red'' to wipe out any associations
with American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The new name? Ideas are welcome.

   Sally Richardson, the national director of the Medicaid program,

childbirth. Medicaid provides health insurance for low-income

   CHICAGO _ There seems to be truth in the adage about the luck of
the Irish, at least when it comes to running for political office.
As sure as the Chicago River runs green for St. Patrick's Day,
politicians with Irish names hold all but a few of the major
offices in Illinois _ from Fitzgerald to Madigan to Devine, a pair
of Ryans, and, of course, another mayor named Daley. The sons and
daughters of Erin also do pretty well elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given a choice, people pick Irish,'' said Michael Hout, a
sociologist at the University of California in Berkeley who
conducted a study of how people of mixed backgrounds identify
themselves on census forms. More people identified themselves as
Irish than immigration and natural selection alone would predict,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The background least often chosen was British. ``For all the
Anglophiles at Harvard, there seems to be some antipathy west of
there to be identified as British,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hout suggested that the ``positive cultural markers'' of the
Irish, traits stereotypically associated with that group _
gregariousness, wit, charm and ``the flavor of the underdog'' _
make them appealing to many Americans. Even St. Patrick's Day, a
day set aside to celebrate the Irish, plays a role, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very things that the Irish were once vilified for _ being
boisterous, charmers, social animals, storytellers _ are seen as
wonderful attributes in American society today,'' said Paul Green,
a political-science professor at Governors State University.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say the euphonious quality of Irish names makes
them songlike. It has become so common for American parents to use
Irish last names like Ryan, Shannon and Kelly for their children's
first names that a Harvard researcher is studying the trend.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Irish love of words seems tailor-made for
politics. President Clinton proclaims ancestral links to Ireland,
as did former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan and many
predecessors. John F. Kennedy was the first Irish Catholic elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   Irish-Americans have long been disproportionately represented in
Congress, said Melvin Holli, a political scientist at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, and the author of books about
ethnicity and politics. ``The priesthood, the police force and
politics _ that's the Irish trinity,'' said Holli, referring to the
Irish influence on those institutions.
</P>
<P>
   As an immigrant group that arrived speaking English, the Irish
built political machines in 19th-century Chicago and New York; they
survived by making inroads in municipal government.
</P>
<P>
   Irish names have been on the ballot so long, goes one theory,
that people simply feel comfortable voting in Irish-Americans. It
certainly helped the legendary Mayor Richard J. Daley and his son,
Richard M. Daley.
</P>
<P>
   Elections for judgeships in Chicago have sometimes been called
``the Irish Sweepstakes,'' given the names of the usual victors. In
one campaign for a Cook County judge last year, voters were given a
choice between James Patrick McCarthy and Bonnie Fitzgerald
McGrath, who happened to be Jewish. McCarthy emerged as the victor,
most likely because he was a Democrat, which can still trump the
opposition in most Chicago wards. (Not always. Michael Flanagan, an
unknown Republican, toppled the powerful, though indicted, Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski.)
</P>
<P>
   Today Irish-Americans, according to research gathered by the
Rev. Andrew Greeley, the Roman Catholic priest and novelist, are a
prosperous, privileged ethnic group. It has been a long journey
from the days when the 19th century refugees of the potato famine
endured open ridicule and discrimination. ``Scratch a convict or a
pauper,'' read an editorial in The Chicago Evening Post in 1868,
``and the chances are that you tickle the skin of an Irish
Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the time being the Chicago descendants of those
immigrants seem to have had the last word even though they are
outnumbered by Americans whose ancestors came from Germany, Eastern
Europe, Africa and Mexico. Chicago baseball teams play in stadiums
named for Irishmen: Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park. O'Hare airport
is named for a World War II hero. An Irish-American has been mayor
for all but nine of the past 66 years, including the first Mayor
Daley, whose ``idea of affirmative action was nine Irishmen and a
Swede,'' his press secretary, Frank Sullivan, once said. It is a
different world for his son, who has put together a diverse City
Hall team. Nearly half of black voters supported Daley in his
landslide victory in February.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Alderman Mathias Bauler wrote a ditty that said
while most immigrant groups detested each other, they would all
vote for an Irishman.
</P>
<P>
   Bauler, who was of German descent, did not use his given first
name in Chicago politics: he went by the nickname Paddy.

   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia _ It would seem like the simplest of
questions, one that could be settled with a few good maps and maybe
a cheap global positioning device: Where on Earth, quite literally,
is the town of Badme?
</P>
<P>
   Badme is a place of no particular consequence in the highlands
between Ethiopia and its much smaller kin, Eritrea, two nations of
great promise on the Horn of Africa. But lying on the battlefields
near this town are the corpses of perhaps 10,000 soldiers _ maybe
less, maybe more _ who died over the last month because each nation
claims Badme and the surrounding area as its own. (For comparison's
sake, 3,200 people have died in Northern Ireland's sectarian
conflict in the last 30 years, according to the U.S. State
Department).
</P>
<P>
   None of the Badme region has much value or historical or
emotional resonance. It is merely undefined. And its outlines
became so ambiguous in a way that tells the story of many conflicts
in modern-day Africa: The colonists of a century ago, in this case
Italy and Britain, buried a time bomb or two in the treaties that
marked off their ambitions. African rulers of today have been
unable, or unwilling, to defuse them.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the treaties are wildly complicated and laughably
imprecise, using tribes and river junctions and obscure mountains
as reference points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling,'' Professor Bahru Zewde said in his office
at Addis Ababa University early this month. He is one of Ethiopia's
leading historians, and he knows as much as anyone about the
history of the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which were a
single nation until Eritrea split off six years ago with Ethiopia's
blessing. He has come to the conclusion, deliberatively and
sincerely, that Badme belongs to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Eritrea says it has looked long and hard at
the same evidence. Asked to make the Eritrean case for this
article, a government spokesman pointed a reporter in the direction
of a Harvard-trained lawyer and U.S. citizen born in Eritrea,
Seyoum Haregot. He is a technical adviser to the United Nations in
Asmara, the Eritrean capital, and he emphasized that he is only a
civil servant who researched the issue not for the government but
out of curiosity. ``I am not ideological about it at all,'' he
said. ``But I believe the Eritreans are right.''
</P>
<P>
   What is fascinating is that both Bahru and Haregot differed
barely at all in the evidence they presented. Each side seems to be
looking at the same facts and drawing completely contrary
conclusions. That has made the dispute especially hard to solve.
</P>
<P>
   What follows, then, is a summary of the major treaties that
marked off the boundary between Ethiopia and Eritrea and how those
documents have been interpreted to justify the latest of Africa's
bloody wars.
</P>
<P>
   Of a dozen or so treaties signed near the turn of the century,
three are important. The key signatories were Italy, which
colonized Eritrea, and Ethiopia, which fought off the Italians'
southward march and remained independent.
</P>
<P>
   A 1908 treaty between the Ethiopians and Italians established
the long eastern border as a line running parallel to the Red Sea.
A 1900 treaty, also between Italy and Ethiopia, established the
eastern part of the Ethiopia-Eritrea boundary along the Mereb River
and two tributaries. To the west, a straight line was drawn between
the town of Tomat, in present-day Sudan, northward to Todluc. And a
treaty signed in 1902 _ the essence of the problem _ moved that
straight line to the east. But the reference points were not the
most precise. Those points became the junction, on the south,
between the Setit and Maieteb Rivers and, on the north, between the
Mereb and Mai Ambessa Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   On some later maps, the 1902 line is moved even farther east,
but in either case Ethiopia claims that the line, which is about 50
miles long, falls to the west of Badme. That is to say, Badme is
Ethiopian.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the maps show this straight line, however capricious it
might be,'' Bahru said. ``There is no way the line could bend.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Eritreans say that even if the line does not bend, it
can indeed move. Haregot pointed to two other sections of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   One provides that the Kunama tribe, a group of highland cattle
drivers, be included in Eritrea. (``This is, as you say in America,
baloney,'' grumbled Professor Mesfin Wolde-Mariam, a retired
geographer and past head of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, who
is opposed to the war completely and furious with both sides.
``People are not stones.'')
</P>
<P>
   The other provision says that Mount Ala Tacura is also included
in Eritrea (The State Department claims it cannot even find this
mountain).
</P>
<P>
   The effect of those two additions, Haregot said, appears to move
the line further east, putting Badme in Eritrea. ``There is no
confusion about the delineation,'' he said. ``That can be
determined by cartographers. There should not be a fight between
the two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But a U.S. official said that even Haregot's interpretation does
not do justice to the issue's full complexity. As an example, he
described the terrain around Badme: ``It's desert right on the edge
of the Ethiopian plateau, and when the rains come they come
suddenly and they rush off the side of the mountains with
tremendous force. When you have water moving with such force, the
rivers move over 97 years. And so the lines move.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain that the treaties made the land theirs, Eritrean forces
marched into the Badme region in May 1998. Fighting lasted a month.
Then, after nine months of re-arming, fighting erupted again Feb.
6.
</P>
<P>
   By Feb. 26, Ethiopia had pushed the Eritreans out of Badme and
Eritrea agreed to a peace proposal drafted last year by the
Organization of African Unity. Ethiopia, saying it had accepted the
plan long ago and was not sure it trusted Eritrea, has not yet
agreed to a truce.
</P>
<P>
   If a cease-fire ever comes, the peace plan requires that experts
go over the ground and finally define the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not think of the borders,'' said Mesfin, of those who
planned Eritrea's independence in 1993. ``So, hurriedly, they were
independent. Now we have no idea what on earth is happening. And
mind you, these are the same people on both sides. They speak the
same language, have the same culture. It's very depressing.''

treaty signed in 1902 _ the essence of the problem _ moved that
straight line to the east. But the reference points were not the
most precise. Those points became the junction, on the south,
between the Setit and Maieteb Rivers and, on the north, between the
Mereb and Mai Ambessa Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   On some later maps, the 1902 line is moved even farther east,
but in either case Ethiopia claims that the line, which is about 50
miles long, falls to the west of Badme. That is to say, Badme is
Ethiopian.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the maps show this straight line, however capricious it
might be,'' Bahru said. ``There is no way the line could bend.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Eritreans say that even if the line does not bend, it
can indeed move. Haregot pointed to two other sections of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   One provides that the Kunama tribe, a group of highland cattle
drivers, be included in Eritrea. (``This is, as you say in America,
baloney,'' grumbled Professor Mesfin Wolde-Mariam, a retired
geographer and past head of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, who
is opposed to the war completely and furious with both sides.
``People are not stones.'')
</P>
<P>
   The other provision says that Mount Ala Tacura is also included
in Eritrea (The State Department claims it cannot even find this
mountain).
</P>
<P>
   The effect of those two additions, Haregot said, appears to move
the line further east, putting Badme in Eritrea. ``There is no
confusion about the delineation,'' he said. ``That can be
determined by cartographers. There should not be a fight between
the two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But a U.S. official said that even Haregot's interpretation does
not do justice to the issue's full complexity. As an example, he
described the terrain around Badme: ``It's desert right on the edge
of the Ethiopian plateau, and when the rains come they come
suddenly and they rush off the side of the mountains with
tremendous force. When you have water moving with such force, the
rivers move over 97 years. And so the lines move.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain that the treaties made the land theirs, Eritrean forces
marched into the Badme region in May 1998. Fighting lasted a month.
Then, after nine months of re-arming, fighting erupted again Feb.
6.
</P>
<P>
   By Feb. 26, Ethiopia had pushed the Eritreans out of Badme and
Eritrea agreed to a peace proposal drafted last year by the
Organization of African Unity. Ethiopia, saying it had accepted the
plan long ago and was not sure it trusted Eritrea, has not yet
agreed to a truce.
</P>
<P>
   If a cease-fire ever comes, the peace plan requires that experts
go over the ground and finally define the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not think of the borders,'' said Mesfin, of those who
planned Eritrea's independence in 1993. ``So, hurriedly, they were
independent. Now we have no idea what on earth is happening. And
mind you, these are the same people on both sides. They speak the
same language, have the same culture. It's very depressing.''

   The interview setting _ Sunday morning in a sprawling, empty
movie studio outside London _ was sepulchral, as vast and quiet as
Hal the computer's trans-galactic homicide scene in ``2001: A Space
Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   And the reclusive film director Stanley Kubrick was formidable,
indeed, when he finally entered a dimly lit office to be
interviewed, brandishing his wariness of celebrity before the lone
questioner.
</P>
<P>
   But the master director proved a charming hermit. Kubrick was
quotably forthcoming 12 years ago once common ground was found in
the only other thing the transplanted New Yorker allowed himself to
watch during the final, manic editing process of making a film _
the latest football Giants videotapes sent from home.
</P>
<P>
   _ By FRANCIS X. CLINES
</P>
<P>
   _ Kubrick seemed particularly taken by the ads that accompanied
the telecasts, finding them to be a source of serendipitous
inspiration:
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen those Michelob commercials? They're just
boy-girl, night-fun, leading up to pouring the beer, all in 30
seconds, beautifully edited and photographed. Economy of statement
is not something that films are noted for.''
</P>
<P>
   _ He smiled in establishing a fine plebeian mood, a belief in
the common-man audience, as he talked of making movies and scouring
all manner of fiction and nonfiction in his endless search for
fresh epiphany:
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with being excited by a story and finally it's
telling the story on the screen. ... It's the most difficult thing.
A good story is a miraculous discovery. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``That first impression is the most precious thing you've got,
you can never have it again _ the yardstick for any judgment that
you have as you get deeper and deeper into the work.''
</P>
<P>
   _ His love of it all became clear:
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a movie is a process of going into smaller and smaller
detail and finally winding up in the minutiae of how does a
footstep sound on the sound track when you're remixing the film.
...
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes from the most wonderful literary atmosphere to
desperation. It can be as crude as standing up and writing on the
back of an envelope when someone's just said something and it's 4
o'clock with the winter sun fading. You've got to shoot it and
you're trying to exploit something that's just come up. It's like a
quarterback calling an automatic play when he sees the defense he's
up against.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Kubrick had trust in the ``more democratic intelligence'' of
the public versus the critics, especially after ``2001'':
</P>
<P>
   ``People who didn't have the responsibility of having to explain
it or formulate clear statements about it two hours after they saw
the film weren't troubled.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Making a movie is like chess:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a series of steps that you take one at a time, and it's
balancing resources against the problem, which in chess is time and
in movies is time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   _ To direct a movie is to protect a single idea:
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of the story the first time you read it is the
absolutely critical yardstick. I remember what I felt about the
book, I remember what I felt in writing the script, and then I try
to keep that alive in the very inappropriate circumstances that
exist on a film set where you've got a hundred people standing
around and nothing but particular problems, still trying to sustain
a subjective sense of what it is emotionally _ as well as what it
is that pleases you.''
</P>
<P>
   _ He found mortality-defying joy in each film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The structure making a movie imposes on your life when you're
doing it again feels like it felt each time before. So there is a
kind of wonderful suggestive timelessness about the structure. I'm
doing exactly the same as I was doing when I was 18 and making my
first movie. It frees you from any other sense of time.''

</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-NATO (Moscow) _ Almost two years after NATO and Russia
sealed a much-advertised cooperation agreement, the two sides are
still refighting old battles over the enlargement of the Western
alliance. Despite the obvious weaknesses of Russia's military
machine, its nuclear muscle and the superpower mentality of its
foreign-policy elite seem destined to insure that those battles
grow no-less rancorous with time. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-NATO (Berlin) _ With Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary now in NATO, Germany finds itself surrounded by allies for
the first time since it was unified in 1871. And the benefits have
been immediate. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-POWER (United Nations) _ In a world with conflicts raging
from Angola to Kosovo, the United Nations Security Council, the
heart of the world body, finds itself increasingly marginalized. By
Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-TA-MOK (Phnom Penh) _ In the harsh politics of Cambodia
today, it is possible that the peasant general Ta Mok will in the
end be the only Khmer Rouge leader called to account for the deaths
of more than a million people between 1975 and 1979. By Seth
Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-UNTOUCHABLES (Shanker Bigha) _ In one of India's poorest
and most populated states, nearly three decades of massacres have
been aimed at keeping low caste Indians in line. By Celia W.
Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   BOLIVIA-BANZER (La Paz, Bolivia) _ While Chile's Gen. Augusto
Pinochet awaits his fate in London, another of Latin America's
former dictators, Hugo Banzer of Bolivia, now the country's elected
president, is also coming under scrutiny for his part in a ``dirty
war'' against leftists in the 1970s. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN-BASQUES (Madrid) _ The arrest last week of the suspected
military chief of the Basque separatist group ETA, while the
guerrillas were observing a unilateral cease-fire, has provoked a
storm of criticism that the government might be squandering a
chance to negotiate an end to 30 years of violence. By Al Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN-AIR-LINK (Berlin) _ Can a city claim to be the ``capital
of Europe'' without a direct air link to the United States? By
Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   IRELAND-SUICIDE (Dublin) _ Young Irish men have one of the
fastest rising rates of suicide in the world. By James F. Clarity.

<P>
   IMMIGRANT-TEENS (New York) _ Over the last several years, a
small but growing number of teen-agers _ virtually all boys, some
as young as 14 or 15 _ have arrived without their parents, much
like the child immigrants of a century ago. Once here, they become
New York's youngest immigrant workers, their cheap, nimble labor
easily absorbed by the city's thriving service economy. On their
own, they are free as birds, and yet they are trapped in an
underground ruled in large measure by fear _ of the immigration
authorities, child welfare agencies, smugglers, thugs and bosses,
past and potential. And immigration scholars and social workers
wonder if they will ever be able to break free. By Somini Sengupta.
</P>
<P>
   APPEALS-FAIRNESS (Fort Myers, Fla.) _ A crushing load of cases
is reshaping the federal appeals courts, second in importance only
to the U.S. Supreme Court, creating a two-level justice system in
which tens of thousands of appeals get limited review so judges can
focus on those they consider significant. By William Glaberson.
With art.
</P>
<P>
   SUBURBIA-FENCES (Undated) _ A new range war has broken out, this
time on the suburban frontier. As in days of old, it concerns
fences _ specifically, wooden stockade fences, which are growing in
popularity and lend a touch of Fort Apache to even the most
unremarkable ranch home. By Patricia Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   MEAT-RECALLS (Undated) _ Contamination of hot dogs and cold cuts
by a sometimes deadly bacterium _ a germ that is little known by
the public _ has led to an extraordinary series of recalls in
recent months, as well as increased government action to detect the
problem sooner and prevent it. By Marian Burros.
</P>
<P>

BOOK ON UNABOMBER DESCRIBES 20 YEARS OF SABOTAGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LINCOLN, Mont. _ Theodore Kaczynski won notoriety as the
Unabomber, the evil genius who mailed deadly pipe bombs to
scientists and corporate targets from California to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But in this mountain village nestled in pine forests below the
Continental Divide, new detective work is giving Kaczynski a new
notoriety: as a pioneer for environmental sabotage. Starting in
1975, a decade before Earth First made ``monkey-wrenching'' a
household term, Kaczynksi opened a local front in his one-man war
against what he called the octopus of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Roaming on foot and on bicycle in a 25-mile radius from his
cabin here, Lincoln's environmental radical, according to several
sources, booby-trapped motorcycle trails with wires strung between
trees, sabotaged mining machinery with sand, burned logging
equipment, poured sugar into snowmobile gas tanks and destroyed
hunting and mining camps and vacation cabins with ax blows.
</P>
<P>
   The account of this 20-year trail of sabotage comes from two
letters Kaczynski wrote from prison in January, an investigation by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a new book by a longtime
neighbor who read part of the hermit's diaries.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the recent letters from prison, where he is serving a
life sentence for bombings that killed three people and wounded 22,
Kaczynski took credit for ``monkeywrenching'' and for shooting a
dog to death, writing, ``Shoot, shovel, and shut up.'' The
neighbor, Chris Waits, said Kaczynski killed nine of his dogs over
a decade, largely by poisoning with strychnine oats. Waits said he
had heard Kaczynski cursing the dogs, whose barking may have
betrayed his whereabouts in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the summer of 1975 and ending with his arrest here
in April 1996, the vandalism campaign caused hundreds of thousands
of dollars in property damage, but apparently no human injuries.
Kaczynski avoided suspicion by varying his targets and locations,
by shunning confrontations with people and by suspending attacks in
the winter, when snow would capture footprints.
</P>
<P>
   The vandalism prompted the only known law-enforcement contact
with Kaczynski before his arrest for the Unabom crimes. In the fall
of 1982, according to a diary entry in Waits' book, Kaczynksi
chopped his way into a vacation home nearly a mile from his cabin,
``smashed up the interior pretty thoroughly,'' and ``thoroughly
smashed'' a motorcycle and four snowmobiles.
</P>
<P>
   One week later, two deputy sheriffs investigating the incident
knocked on his cabin door and stood face to face with a man who was
wanted nationwide for seven bomb attacks. So far the bombings had
wounded but not killed people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so cool and collected in answering cops questions,''
Kaczynski boasted in a numerical code entry decoded 14 years later
by the FBI. Noting that the police never returned _ and that his
terrorized neighbors did not resume snowmobiling that winter _ he
wrote: ``Who says crime doesn't pay? I feel very good about this.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lincoln, the vandalism was not seen as a one-man crime wave,
in part because of a lack of communication between summer people
and year-round residents, and in part because of turnover of local
law-enforcement personnel, said Waits, one of a handful of current
residents who were here in 1971, when Kaczynski and his brother,
David, bought a 1.4-acre lot east of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a lot of these things happened, we thought it was kids
out on a weekend rampage,'' said Waits, who wrote his book,
``Unabomber: The Secret Life of Ted Kaczynski,'' with Dave Shors,
an editor at The Independent Record of Helena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did do some monkeywrenching in the Lincoln area,'' Kaczynski
wrote the Helena newspaper in January. ``I did, for example,
attempt to injure trailbikers by setting traps for those who took
their motorcycles off the road and back into the hills.''
</P>
<P>
   The book describes about 25 incidents of vandalism. Waits, who
worked closely with FBI investigators here and said he read ``at
least 1,000 pages'' of the journals, calculates that there were
more than 50 attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Lincoln, Kaczynski concentrated his attacks on loggers,
miners and recreationists who used motorized vehicles. To him,
motorcycles, snowmobiles and ``evil jet planes'' were tips of a
technological ``octopus'' reaching into the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cut the fan-belt, cut some tubes, put dirt in the place
where oil goes in,'' Kaczynski wrote in his journal on Oct. 23,
1979, after attacking a mining camp. ``There was a nice new pickup
down by the road, I think belonging to some of these mining fools,
and I smashed the windshield and cut some belts and tubes on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kaczynski called himself ``a primitive
hunter-gatherer'' and fed himself by poaching, he despised other
hunters. In his diaries, he wrote of attacking empty hunting camps
or cabins. Angry after hearing shots during the hunting season in
1975, he wrote: ``Makes me about ready to join the ban-hunting
crowd, just to keep these disgusting twerps out of the woods. Of
course I'd hunt anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   At Garland's Town and Country, where goods and local news cross
the counter daily, book sales have been brisk. ``I had a man in
here the other day, looking at the pictures, and he said, `Look at
that bulldozer burned up _ that was mine,''' said Teresa Garland,
the proprietor.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that another patron had said Kaczynski ``sugared'' his
snowmobile gas tanks in the mid-1980s, Ms. Garland added, ``It is
clearing up some of those unsolved deals.''

PROSECUTORS FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA'S MEXICAN MAFIA, `THE GANG OF
GANGS'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As guilty verdicts were read, over and over, in
the racketeering prosecution two years ago of the prison gang known
as la Eme, a pattern emerged: one defendant, Victor Murillo, was
being acquitted of all counts against him. His co-defendants
cheered, and ultimately he was the only one of 13 men on trial to
be set free.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, Murillo's name surfaced again in court papers,
as federal prosecutors filed two new indictments against 27
suspected members of la Eme (so named for the Spanish pronunciation
of the letter M). This time, however, Murillo is making his
appearance as a murder victim.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities here have turned their sights once again on la
Eme, known as the Mexican Mafia, one of California's oldest and
still most powerful prison gangs, charging its members under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act with waging a
brutal campaign for control of Southern California's gangs and drug
trade.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest case, the defendants, said to have stepped in to
fill the power vacuum created by the conviction of Murillo's
confederates, are charged in connection with four murders and 13
conspiracies to commit murder, and face other counts including
attempted murder, assault and drug trafficking. Eleven of the
defendants in the new case were in state prison for previous
convictions when the indictments were unsealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with what we perceive to be significant criminal problems,
we will address them until they are eliminated,'' said Alejandro
Mayorkas, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles. ``Our first prosecutive
effort directed toward the Mexican Mafia had a significant impact
upon the organization. It did not, however, eliminate the criminal
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   La Eme was conceived as a ``gang of gangs'' by inmates from East
Los Angeles at the Deuel Vocational Institution south of Sacramento
in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Membership is for life _ ``blood in, blood out'' the oath goes _
and the penalty for breaking rules is death. Its membership is
almost exclusively Mexican American, drawn from Southern California
gang members who have been incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   As the cases make clear, those often in harm's way from la Eme
are the group's own members. Of 12 murders and attempted murders in
the previous prosecution, five were of ``carnales,'' or brothers.
One suspected member, Mariano Martinez, 41, is listed as a
defendant in one of the new indictments, and as the target of a
murder plot in the other.
</P>
<P>
   While most details of Murillo's death, and life, have remained
closely held by the task force that has spent most of the decade
investigating the Mexican Mafia, his story illustrates how one's
star rises and falls in the gang.
</P>
<P>
   Murillo, 51 at the time of his trial, was said by investigators
to have joined la Eme in the 1970s during a stay in federal prison
for fraud, and to have done brisk business as a supplier of cocaine
and speed.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with two racketeering conspiracy counts in the
1995 case, for being present at surreptitiously videotaped Mexican
Mafia meetings where votes were taken on murder contracts and drug
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   On April 4, 1998, less than a year after his acquittal the
previous May, Murillo was shot to death in a dirt parking lot
outside Visalia, the small farming town where he lived in
California's Central Valley. Speaking on condition of anonymity,
officials have suggested a number of motives for his death,
including his alliance with veteran members of the gang in the face
of a generational rivalry and a refusal to share drug proceeds with
younger members, or possibly retribution for a perception prompted
by his acquittal that he had cooperated with law-enforcement
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Woody, 27, a suspected Mexican Mafia member, is charged
with Murillo's death in the new case. Woody has pleaded not guilty;
his lawyer, William S. Harris, declined to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, la Eme sought to extend its influence beyond
prison walls to the street, organizing street gangs in large public
meetings to declare a ban on drive-by shootings and requiring gangs
to pay ``taxes'' on drug profits. The gangs mostly cooperated for
fear of retribution by la Eme and to protect fellow street gang
members in prison. State corrections officials estimate la Eme's
ranks at up to 700 members, with thousands more on the street eager
to do its bidding for a chance at membership.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors first charged members of the gang in 1995,
hoping to break their power by sprinkling them through the larger
federal prison system.
</P>
<P>
   Although the gang's tax collections continue, probation
officers, police officers and one (Eds.: Production notes are at
end of review. Time, channel are for New York area. Check local
listings.) &QL; 
gang member say the prosecution has somewhat weakened la Eme and
forced members to adopt a lower profile. But as a result, they say,
the old shooting truce that was once enforced by the Mexican Mafia
is in tatters, and 24 people have been killed on the streets of
East Los Angeles in the resulting gang war over the last six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gang members sense that no one's going to enforce
violations of the code,'' said a probation officer who would only
speak on the condition of anonymity. ``Who's going to issue
sanctions? So there's a lessening of control over the street gangs.
It's kind of the yin and yang, you get some good and some bad with
it. But if you wait for organized crime to set the standards for
our society, it's pretty sorry indeed.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ A crushing load of cases is forcing a
reshaping of the federal appeals courts, creating a two-level
justice system in which tens of thousands of appeals receive
limited reviews, judges and legal scholars say.
</P>
<P>
   Some judges say the changes are necessary for judges on the
appeals courts _ which are second in importance only to the Supreme
Court _ to cope with the steadily growing number of cases without
increasing the length of time people must wait for rulings.
</P>
<P>
   But as fewer than half of all cases are argued before judges and
only a fourth of all decisions are rendered in full published
opinions _ many decisions consist of a single word, ``affirmed'' or
``denied'' _ critics say the United States' circuit appeals courts
are changing their role, with people's legal rights often damaged
by the shift.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reviewing every case that comes before them, as
federal law requires, the critics say, the appeals courts are
becoming more like the Supreme Court, which has the power to decide
which cases it will hear.
</P>
<P>
   Complex civil rights, antitrust and other cases that appeals
judges deem important get the same detailed consideration as
always. But some judges and legal scholars say that entire classes
of appeals deemed routine, such as petitions from prison inmates
and individuals' disability claims under Social Security, get
abbreviated attention as staff lawyers sort out cases to recommend
for full hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a two-track system, and the tracks basically get
allocated by nonjudges,'' said Patricia Wald, a judge on the
District of Columbia U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The country's 12 federal circuit courts began reorganizing
themselves in the 1980s, introducing shortcuts in the way they
review appeals to help judges cope with the number of cases, which
grew to 53,805 last year from 33,360 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most controversial changes, the appeals courts
created new staff lawyer positions, permanent employees with the
authority to screen and, some critics say, to effectively decide
thousands of cases by giving judges brief summaries of recommended
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question of whether the new shortcuts are fair has been
put squarely before one of the appeals courts that has led the
changes, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, in an
appeal of a political corruption case in Fort Myers, on Florida's
Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, lawyers for a former county commissioner convicted
of depriving her constituents of her ``honest services'' are trying
to challenge a one-word ruling upholding the conviction _
``affirmed'' _ by a three-judge panel. Her lawyers contend that it
is not even possible for them to tell why her appeal was denied,
much less to try to appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers have asked the full 12-member court to review the
decision as well as the court's streamlined appeals procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The case has attracted national attention among defense lawyers,
partly because the Atlanta court is known as one of the architects
of abbreviated appeals procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Some judges and scholars say the proliferation of one-word
decisions and other abbreviated procedures is shortchanging
litigants in the appellate process by limiting the consideration
given to their cases by appeals judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many procedural shortcuts that appeals today are
processed in a kind of assembly line and the judges are not paying
enough attention to individual cases, because they can't,'' said
Thomas Baker, a professor at Drake University Law School in Des
Moines, Iowa, who has written extensively about the appeals courts.
</P>
<P>
   With the Supreme Court giving full review to no more than 200
cases a year and the highest courts of many states also limited in
the number of cases they can hear, some legal scholars say, the
increasing use of abbreviated review procedures by intermediate
appeals courts means litigants are quickly losing the right to
meaningful appeals.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the abbreviated treatment given to many cases,
some judges and scholars say, is a sharp decline in the number of
decisions that federal appeals courts publish in law books.
Unpublished decisions do not establish precedents.
</P>
<P>
   In studies of unpublished decisions, two law professors, William
Reynolds of the University of Maryland and William Richman of the
University of Toledo, say the rulings are usually so succinct that
it is impossible to discern the facts of a case or the reasons for
the judges' ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Court statistics show that federal appeals courts now publish
only 24 percent of their decisions, down sharply from 54 percent in
1985. ``It is sort of a formula for irresponsibility,'' said
Richard Posner, the chief judge of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Chicago. ``Most judges, myself included, are not nearly
as careful in dealing with unpublished decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some federal appeals judges say many cases are given abbreviated
reviews because they are frivolous. No one, they say, is being
denied careful appellate review.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal courts,'' said Harvie Wilkinson III, the chief
judge of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.,
``have developed sophisticated management techniques that
differentiate between cases that are genuinely difficult and
challenging and those which are straightforward.'' His court had
the highest percentage of unpublished decisions last year, 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new methods of handling appeals are necessary, some judges
acknowledge, because many federal appeals judges have fought
efforts to increase their number. The judges have said the quality
and collegiality of the federal bench would be diluted if too many
new judges were added. The number of judges on the circuit courts
has increased to only 167 from 156 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In the case in Fort Myers, Vicki Lopez-Lukis, a former Lee
County commissioner, was convicted in 1997 of depriving her
constituents of her honest services by taking payments from a
Washington lobbyist, Sylvester Lukis, while considering government
projects he was promoting for clients. At the time, the two were
having an affair. They are now married.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors charged the two with 11 counts each in the
bribery case. Sylvester Lukis was acquitted of all charges, while
Mrs. Lukis was convicted of only one count. The couple contended
that the payments were to help her pay for an apartment the two
shared here and had not influenced her votes.
</P>
<P>
   After a jury convicted Mrs. Lukis of one count and she was
sentenced to serve 27 months in prison, she appealed. On Jan. 27,
the three-judge appeals panel handed down its one-word decision.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lukis' lawyer, Thomas Green, a well-known Washington
defense lawyer, says his client's case shows how unfair the
shortcuts in the courts have become; he raised a series of legal
arguments that he said were far from frivolous. Among other things,
he said that if the appeals panel had issued an opinion defining
``honest services,'' he would have had a better chance of
persuading the Supreme Court to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of that concern, Green has asked the full
12-member 11th Circuit Court to make a rare decision to review the
decision of the three-judge panel in Mrs. Lukis' case and use it to
limit what he says are unfair procedures.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court handles federal appeals from Alabama,
Florida and Georgia. Each of the circuit courts across the country
reviews cases in panels of three judges. Unusual cases are
sometimes reviewed after a three-judge panel decision by all of the
judges on a circuit, typically a dozen or more.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers filed a
brief as a friend of the court, asserting that shortcuts like the
one-word opinions are diminishing the public's confidence in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   The debate in the case shows how the dispute over the
abbreviated appeals proceedings is playing out across the country.
The federal prosecutor in the case, Douglas Molloy, said fuller
review of Mrs. Lukis' appeal would waste the court's time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they issue a one-word opinion,'' Molloy said, ``it's a
way of saying, `You brought an appeal that had absolutely no
merit.'''
</P>
<P>
   For defense lawyers, such succinct rulings are frustrating
because they make it virtually impossible to appeal further. If a
federal appeals court has not even specified its reasons for
upholding a lower court ruling, the chances that the Supreme Court
will consider a case are small.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here, Mrs. Lukis said the one-word opinion left
her wondering whether political influence or bias against her as a
Hispanic woman had played a part in her case. ``They didn't tell me
why they decided what they decided,'' she said. ``I think they owe
me that.''
</P>
<P>
   Terse rulings in criminal cases that are deemed routine often
benefit prosecutors, as courts uphold convictions without having to
state legal reasons. But sometimes it is prosecutors who are put at
a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   When a federal appeals court ruled in 1996 that there were legal
problems with the politically popular conviction of Charles
Keating, the former savings and loan executive convicted of
defrauding customers, the court issued a two-paragraph decision
that did not mention some prosecution arguments.
</P>
<P>
   In their studies of the use of brief circuit court decisions,
Richman and Reynolds have suggested that sketchy rulings may
sometimes be used by judges who want to reach a certain legal
result but are not anxious for their decision to be scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, Reynolds said, the rapid growth of
shortcuts in the appeals courts means that people involved in legal
cases are not getting the attention from federal appeals courts
that most of them expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think if you have an appeal, your lawyer argues
the case and a judge decides,'' he said. ``That's not what we have.
We have a system where there is often no argument, there is no
requirement for a judge to write a decision, and the
decision-making is largely done by people who are not judges.''

   BOILER-ROOMS (Los Angeles) _ It took just a telephone call to
sweet talk Jeff Daly out of $20,000. A smooth telemarketer promised
the Agua Dulce man up to a 400 percent profit if he invested in a
film called ``Operation: Desert Gold,'' he says. So he forked over
the money, unaware he was joining the ranks of people who
prosecutors say are defrauded in telemarketing scams, many of them
now based in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley. Daly's case is not unique.
In Los Angeles alone, during a 1998 federal crackdown about 20
boiler-room operations were identified including ``Operation:
Desert Gold,'' federal officials said. By Phillip W. Browne. (Will

New York's youngest immigrant workers, their cheap, nimble labor
easily absorbed by the city's thriving service economy. Yet they
are trapped in an underground ruled in large measure by fear _ of
the immigration authorities, child welfare agencies, smugglers,
thugs and bosses, past and potential. And immigration scholars and
social workers wonder if they will ever be able to break free. By

TELEMARKETING RAIDS REVEAL SCAM VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took just a telephone call to sweet-talk Jeff
Daly out of $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   A smooth telemarketer promised the Agua Dulce man up to a 400
percent profit if he invested in a film called ``Operation: Desert
Gold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he forked over the money, joining the swelling ranks of
people defrauded by Southern California telemarketing schemes,
increasingly based in the San Fernando Valley, authorities say.
They include the one the FBI says Chris Rawlings ran before he was
kidnapped from his home and killed in the crash of his Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their primary existence is to take money from people,'' said
Daly, 50. ``I have no idea how I ended up on their phone lists.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly's case is not unique.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles alone last year, a federal crackdown identified
about 20 telemarketing scams, called boiler rooms because of their
high-pressure selling tactics. They included the one selling
``Operation: Desert Gold,'' federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and local investigators broke up telemarketing
operations in 40 states during the past year, accusing them of
bilking excited investors out of more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many fraudulent telemarketing
operations exist in Los Angeles, but recent raids have turned up
thousands of victims scammed by Valley operations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They include Rawlings' multimillion-dollar telemarketing
operation, which may have led to his death, police said. It was
just a small glimpse at the phony industry.
</P>
<P>
   The operation used several locations from Calabasas to West Los
Angeles and involved at least seven others, who have been indicted
on mail fraud charges tied to an alleged telemarketing scheme.
Altogether with Rawlings, they are accused of bilking investors out
of more than $19 million over several years.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-count indictment charges that Peter Aro, John Dickens,
Timothy Griffeith, Vincent Rabiola, John Watson, Gerald Whiteford
and Michael Wineman operated a scheme to defraud mostly elderly
victims who thought they were investing in unrelated Beatles and
Marvin Gaye recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Telemarketing scammers prey on people looking for quick ways to
make money and seem gullible.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these people are elderly with fading memories,'' said
Herschel Elkins, a senior assistant attorney general with the
state's Consumer Law Section in Los Angeles. ``They are target No.
1.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside nondescript storefronts or offices across L.A.'s San
Fernando Valley, hundreds of low-paid telemarketers follow scripts
and cold-call households fishing for cash.
</P>
<P>
   And the number of victims scammed by area boiler rooms is in the
tens of thousands, which state officials have calculated using
files left behind in vacated office spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vulnerable investors sometimes give away their life savings
over the telephone and they never see a return because scammers
pocket the cash,'' said Lisa A. Gok, assistant regional director of
the Securities and Exchange Commission's office of enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to all be in Orange County, now there's a trend into
the Valley. There's no real explanation for it except that the
migrate from place to place,'' Gok said.
</P>
<P>
   The scams have created such grave mistrust toward legitimate
venture capitalists that independent film producer Bill Lansford,
owner of El Dorado Productions, decided finance his film ``Adios
East Los'' with investments from friends and their contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met face to face with our investors, unlike the
fast-talking Hollywood crooks. They're a small group of weasles,''
he said. ``Our investors understand that we don't lease Rolls
Royces and smoke Cuban cigars, and that gives them a better chance
of making a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   They've even made life difficult for direct-marketing businesses
including Kevin Peterson Publishing in Encino, despite the fact
that they do business-to-business marketing _ not phone
solicitations for cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler rooms have created skepticism with potential clients,
and some of them have been burned before,'' Peterson said. ``It
makes it tougher to get new clients because they envision scam
businesses where there's a guy walking around yelling, `Make more
calls.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Operation: Desert Gold,'' the Securities and
Exchange Commission is suing three principals in the venture
capital scheme, which ran between 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC alleges that David Burnell and J. Eric Rymland, both of
San Francisco, and Daniel Rung of Riverside ran a scheme that
bilked 600 investors out of more than $8 million. ``Operation:
Desert Gold'' was based in San Francisco and Riverside, but they
had a boiler room operating in Van Nuys as well, the SEC alleges.
</P>
<P>
   The case remains in litigation.

EXPERTS WORRY ABOUT DEADLY GERM IN COLD CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Vt.)   (See also MEAT-RECALLS-PREVENT)  
(lb) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contamination of hot dogs and cold cuts by a sometimes deadly
bacterium _ one that is little known by the public _ has led to an
extraordinary series of recalls in recent months, as well as
increased government action to detect the problem sooner and
prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   There had been few reports of contamination by the bacterium,
Listeria monocytogenes, over the last six years. But it resurfaced
in December, when 35 million pounds of hot dogs and processed
luncheon meats were recalled following an outbreak of listeriosis.
Nearly 100 people in 22 states became ill, and 20 deaths were
reported
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, the Department of Agriculture has announced
eight recalls because of listeria, seven of processed meats and one
of milk. By comparison, the December recall was one of only three
announced by the federal agency in 1998, and two were announced in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although no deaths have been linked to the recalls so far in
1999, the December outbreak ``shook everyone up,'' said Dr. Kay
Wachsmuth, deputy administrator for the office of public health and
science in the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and
Inspection Service.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is quite sure what to make of it. ``We can't tell at
this point if there is a resurgence,'' Dr. Wachsmuth said.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria does not pose much danger to most people. But it is a
serious threat to the elderly, to pregnant women, to fetuses and
newborns, and to those whose immune systems are compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Food-borne bacteria like salmonella, E. coli and listeria are
common in raw food, but cooking kills them. Scientists don't yet
understand how listeria got into the processed foods that have been
recently recalled. Testing techniques vary even among government
agencies, and scientists do not yet know what level of bacteria is
harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Since the outbreak in December _ which was linked to products
made by Bil Mar Foods, a subsidiary of Sara Lee _ the Agriculture
Department has been searching for the reasons listeria has surfaced
again.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has begun to focus on the long shelf lives of these
ready-to-eat products as a factor. Shelf life _ the length of time
after manufacture that a food can safely be sold _ has increased
considerably in the last 10 years because of better plant
sanitation. But unlike many other disease-causing bacteria,
listeria does grow at refrigerator and freezer temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent changes designed to track and control listeria are
already in place. Others are under study:
</P>
<P>
   _ A new DNA test has been adopted that allows the federal
government to quickly link cases across the United States to a
single source of contamination.
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal and state agencies are working to improve coordination
so that information can be transmitted more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   _ Food processors must now hold more product, and for a longer
time, if a sample tests positive for listeria, to prevent the
distribution of potentially contaminated foods.
</P>
<P>
   _ Regulators are considering making microbial testing mandatory,
and requiring warning labels on franks and cold cuts. They are also
weighing a consumer education campaign to warn those at greatest
risk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Processors are examining new techniques for sanitizing their
facilities. Failures in sanitation may be at the heart of the
outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   But underneath this flurry of activity a basic problem remains:
lack of sound scientific data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listeria is a major challenge,'' said Dr. Michael Osterholm,
the former state epidemiologist at the Minnesota Health Department.
``Manufacturers and consumers are left not knowing'' what the
infectious dose is, whether one strain is more virulent than others
and whether current microbial testing techniques are sensitive
enough to find the bacteria at very low levels.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria is widespread in the natural world, lurking in many
species of animals, including household pets, as well as in ticks,
soil, dust, streams and a wide variety of foods. Healthy people are
usually not affected, or at worst, suffer a throat or intestinal
infection with mild flulike symptoms. But full-blown listeriosis
may cause meningitis and encephalitis among vulnerable groups.
</P>
<P>
   The population that is at risk is growing, as the number of
elderly increases along with the numbers of people with weakened
immune systems like cancer and transplant patients and people with
AIDS. Pregnant women are especially vulnerable, as are their unborn
children; even a mild infection may result in miscarriage,
stillbirth or life-threatening illness for a newborn.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials are particularly concerned because the
percentage of people who die from listeria is apparently much
higher than it is from better-known but less lethal food-borne
bacteria like salmonella, campylobacter and E. coli 0157:H7. In
addition, the incubation period is much longer. Symptoms of
listeriosis can take up to 70 days to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Listeriosis can be treated successfully with antibiotics, but
even with drug treatment the mortality rate is about 30 percent. Of
the 20 deaths linked to the Bil Mar outbreak, six were miscarriages
or stillbirths and most of the adults were over 60.
</P>
<P>
   Until December, there was good reason to think that listeria was
under control. The last outbreak of listeriosis occurred in 1994.
Epidemiologists differentiate between outbreaks, when multiple
illnesses can be attributed to a single source, and individual
cases with no known links.
</P>
<P>
   That followed years of efforts by food processors and the
government to eliminate the problem. Scientists began to focus on
listeria in 1985, after an outbreak traced to Jalisco brand soft
cheese caused 142 cases of listeriosis and more than 40 deaths.
Food processors took steps to improve sanitation in their
factories.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Agriculture Department adopted a tougher
policy for listeria levels in processed meats: automatic recall if
any listeria is found. Between 1989 and 1993 there was a 44 percent
reduction in the cases of listeriosis. The incidence has remained
constant since then, at about 1,100 cases a year.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain if the growing number of recalls since the Bil
Mar outbreak is the result of an actual increase in listeria
contamination, increased public awareness, or additional government
surveillance and the introduction of a new surveillance system
called FoodNet and a sophisticated detection system called
Pulsenet.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a recent increase in financing for food safety, the
government has set up eight sites around the country for active
surveillance of food-borne diseases. They make weekly reports to
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which can
immediately alert health officials in all 50 states. In the past it
often took weeks, sometimes months, for the CDC to learn about
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are also trying to improve the links among
themselves and with state officials. A food-safety task force,
called the Foodborne Outbreak Response Coordinating Group, was set
up two years ago to deal with emergencies and was used in the large
outbreak of salmonella in cereal in 1998. Notification is now made
electronically. ``We are getting better,'' said Dr. Wachsmuth of
the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pulsenet, activated in 1998, allows scientists to fingerprint
the DNA of bacteria. Dr. Wachsmuth said that without Pulsenet, the
listeria outbreak in December might never have been linked to Bil
Mar products.
</P>
<P>
   Each year the agency performs about 3,500 microbial tests for
listeria in meat-processing plants. Once there has been an
outbreak, the number of tests increases.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the routine tests, some of the recalls have been the
result of microbial testing by distributors and by the agency's
compliance officers responding to consumer complaints. ``Lots of
folks hear there are lots of recalls, and it makes them nervous and
we catch more,'' Dr. Wachsmuth said.
</P>
<P>
   New rules on food samples that test positive for listeria have
been in place since August and may have played a role in the
higher-than-usual number of recalls. Processors are now required to
hold the entire day's output from the production line where a
positive sample was found. Previously the plant was required to
hold only the production from two hours on either side of the
positive sample.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers, too, are trying to take corrective action.
They are changing the flooring for better drainage, looking at the
locations of the air-conditioning unit, separating raw production
from processed products and scrutinizing the methods they use for
cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eradication of listeria from the environment that could
contaminate food might not be impossible,'' Dr. Wachsmuth said.
``But I'm not aware of any silver bullet. They just have to do
these sanitary operation procedures more rigorously, and you couple
that with environmental testing to make sure you've eliminated the
listeria.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department is considering mandatory microbial
testing of ready-to-eat products, a move vigorously opposed by the
industry. Some plants already test the environment. If listeria is
discovered, then products are sometimes tested, but those in the
industry would rather not discuss specifics.
</P>
<P>
   An industry spokeswoman explained that most plants do not test
for listeria, because of the Agriculture Department's zero
tolerance level for the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government is standing in the way of doing
testing,'' said Jenny Scott, the senior food-safety program
director of the National Food Processors Association. ``The problem
is the zero tolerance policy for listeria in ready-to-eat products.
Because you can't have any listeria in a product, there is a
potential legal and regulatory liability if you test the product
and find listeria.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a public-health
advocacy group in Washington, has asked the Agriculture Department
to require testing of hot dogs, cold cuts, luncheon meats and other
fully cooked meat and poultry products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the industry is fighting mandatory testing for
economic, not scientific reasons,'' said Caroline Smith DeWaal, the
director of food safety for the center. ``The industry is liable if
anyone gets sick, regardless of whether they test or not. Testing
would add an additional layer of protection.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also no consensus on what the tolerance level should
be, because of a lack of data. No one knows what an infectious dose
of listeria is, Dr. Wachsmuth said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bala Swaminathan, chief of the food-borne and diarrheal
diseases laboratory section of the CDC, said: ``For foods that are
not to be cooked, I'm in favor of zero tolerance until we have a
better idea of the infectious dose, and I think microbial testing
should be done. We will never be able to define a single infectious
dose for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department has also been looking very closely at
the shelf life of ready-to-eat foods. As listeria levels in
processed meats dropped because of increased sanitation, between
1989 and 1993, processors extended the sell-by and use-by dates on
their products. Long shelf life may provide the opportunity for
listeria to grow and reach levels that cause listeriosis, and some
testing methods are not sensitive enough to detect very low levels
of listeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulatory testing misses about 25 percent of what might be
there,'' said Dr. Catherine Donnelly, professor of nutrition and
food science and a food microbiologist at the University of
Vermont. Dr. Donnelly said that a newer test she uses has a 98
percent success rate. The USDA is looking at new testing methods.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions have also been made about the importance of
notifying high-risk consumers with an education campaign and
warning labels on ready-to-eat products.
</P>
<P>
   While food processors generally oppose warning labels, there is
agreement that, as Janet Riley of the American Meat Institute said,
the public does not know much about listeria. ``I don't think there
is a strong awareness about risks,'' Ms. Riley said. ``I was never
provided with any of this information by my obstetrician.''

TIPS FOR AVOIDING LISTERIOSIS INFECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With MEAT-RECALLS)  
(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To protect against listeriosis, the government advises consumers
to thoroughly cook raw animal products; thoroughly wash all food
that is to be eaten raw, like fruits and vegetables; keep foods to
be eaten raw separate from uncooked meats; and wash hands, knives
and cutting boards with hot soapy water.
</P>
<P>
   Those most vulnerable to listeriosis are advised also to do the
following:
</P>
<P>
   Avoid all soft cheeses, including feta, Camembert, brie and
blue-veined cheeses like Roquefort.
</P>
<P>
   Cook hot dogs until the internal temperature reaches 165
degrees, by either steaming or frying. Cooking in a microwave oven
is not recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid deli meats like salami, corned beef, bologna and
liverwurst unless they get additional cooking _ for example, a hot
corned-beef sandwich.

SUICIDE RATE OF YOUTHS IS CLIMBING IN IRELAND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Though long stereotyped as a happy land of pious
churchgoers and bibulous dancers of jigs, Ireland is suffering a
sharply rising increase in suicides, particularly among young men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ireland has the fastest-growing rate of youth suicide in the
world, and almost one in four suicides occur among those aged
between 15 and 24,'' said the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin in a
statement at a recent conference on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   A government task force reported earlier this year that the rate
of suicides of males between 15 and 24 was about 19 per 100,000
people, higher than that in most European countries and apparently
growing. Since 1945, the overall rate of suicide in Ireland has
increased from 2.5 to nearly 14. The rate in England is about 12,
and in Northern Ireland, torn for 30 years by sectarian warfare,
about 11. Since 1987, the number of Irish people who have killed
themselves has doubled, to about 500 a year, and men are
responsible for four of five of those deaths.
</P>
<P>
   These figures are lower than the actual number of suicides
because police in rural areas often report suicides as accidents to
spare the feelings of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that while alcoholism, depression and other serious
illnesses still are major causes of suicide here, other broader
changes in Irish society may also be contributing.
</P>
<P>
   First is the church's admittedly more benign view of suicide,
which is no longer vehemently condemned from the pulpit in this
overwhelmingly Catholic country. Second, experts say, is the
changing roles of men and women in what remains a male-dominated
society. Ten years ago only one-third of married women held jobs
outside their homes; now the number is approaching the European
Union average of about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equality for women is a good thing,'' Dr. John Sheehan, a
psychiatrist at the Mater Hospital in Dublin, said in an interview.
``But men now feel unsure of their roles. They fear they may no
longer be the breadwinners.''
</P>
<P>
   John Waters, the author of books on Irish society and a
columnist for The Irish Times, asserts that newspapers and
television programs still avoid reporting and analyzing suicide.
For older Irish men and women, this recalls the debate in the late
1940s over the treatment of suicide in the novel ``The Heart of the
Matter,'' by Graham Greene, the English writer whose work was
discussed here with particular interest because he was a convert to
Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, one character speculates that the suicide, Scobie,
may be pardoned by God and should not be condemned by men. The
suggestion now seems prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Pat O'Donoghue, who has created a special liturgy for
relations of people who commit suicide, noted that the
Vatican-approved Catechism says that suicide is ``against natural
law.'' But it adds: ``By ways known to Him alone, God can provide
the opportunity for salutary repentance. The church prays for
persons who have taken their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The church, O'Donoghue added, has since 1961 permitted suicides
to be buried in consecrated ground after official Masses of
requiem. He acknowledged that the fear of hell that once deterred
suicidal people was disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan, the hospital psychiatrist, agreed. ``A major social
change in Ireland,'' he wrote in a recent article in the Dublin
Archdiocese newsletter, ``has been the decline in religious
practice over the past 20 years. It appears that there is an
inverse relationship between the practice of religion and the rise
in suicide. Young people are no longer frightened of eternal
damnation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Dublin area, where about one-third of the population of
3.6 million lives, about 200 people call the Samaritans, a
volunteer organization, every day, many of them to discuss their
possible suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gallagher, the director of the Samaritans' Dublin office,
said people often call in and start discussing a different problem,
like the death of a relative, before the volunteer carefully raises
the question of suicide. But about one-third of the callers never
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be their first port of call or their last port of
call,'' he said. ``They want you to know you're going to be the
last person on earth to speak to them. We offer support. We don't
usually know where they go after that.''

NATO TRIES TO SMOOTH TIES TO RUSSIA BEFORE 50TH ANNIVERSARY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If NATO's diplomats get their way, next month's 50th
birthday party in Washington will be replete with post-Cold War
symbolism, featuring top Russian officials in its large cast to
demonstrate just how well the old enemies now work side by side.
</P>
<P>
   There is just one small problem: Russia has not yet decided if
it wants the part.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin, playing as hard to get as ever, says it might
dispatch a senior representative to the celebration _ but only if a
rupture is avoided over Kosovo and limits are put on the number of
alliance troops that can be rushed during any crisis to Poland, the
Czech Republic or Hungary, who joined NATO on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years after NATO and Russia sealed a much-advertised
cooperation agreement, the two sides are still refighting old
battles over the enlargement of the Western alliance. Despite the
obvious weaknesses of Russia's military machine, its nuclear muscle
and the superpower mentality of its foreign-policy elite seem
destined to ensure that those battles grow no-less rancorous with
time.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to reassure a Russia still unhappy about NATO's
enlargement, NATO has confidentially proposed to limit crisis
deployments to bolster Poland, the Czech Republic or Hungary. The
two divisions that could be dispatched to each of these nations
under the Western plan would be equivalent to a light army corps
with about 460 tanks. The Russians, though, want to limit such
deployments to a division or even less.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian strategy, however, is to undermine NATO
effectiveness,'' said Sergei Karaganov of the Council on Foreign
and Defense Policy, a group of opinion makers with close ties to
the Russian government and military circles. ``We want to have NATO
as weak as possible because we are not part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the NATO-Russian relationship is troubled. NATO and
Russian officials meet regularly in Brussels over security policy,
and the two sides conduct joint peacekeeping patrols in Bosnia. But
the two sides have yet to establish a genuine partnership _ and the
future of the relationship looks anything but rosy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is not only trying to blunt any military advantage the
alliance derives from now admitting Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Its longer-term strategy is to discourage the alliance from
trying to include the Baltic states _ Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
_ or other former Soviet-bloc nations by making the process as
diplomatically painful as possible _ an approach Western officials
call the ``root canal'' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's anxiety over NATO, by and large, is a preoccupation of
its political elite. Virtually nobody in Russia is happy about the
alliance's decision to accept new members. But the issue ranks
relatively low on the average citizen's long litany of worries, a
list dominated by domestic concerns like soaring prices, unpaid
wages and crime.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively modulated response of the public is important
because it makes it unlikely that a rabid nationalist could rise to
power on a surge of anti-NATO resentment, the calamity many critics
of NATO expansion said they expected.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls also show that popular unease over NATO is
along generational lines _ the young are far less worried than
elderly Russians who lived through the Cold War _ and thus may fade
in time.
</P>
<P>
   But if NATO expansion has not changed the face of Russian
domestic politics, it has contributed to the sourness of the West's
diplomatic relations with Russia, already under stress from
disputes over Iraq, the former Yugoslavia and arms control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign policy is always a preoccupation of the elites,'' said
Aleksei Arbatov, a member of Parliament from the liberal Yabloko
party and an acerbic critic of NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the West's diplomacy over the last few years has been
aimed at preventing the bitterness that Russian politicians feel
over NATO's expansion from bubbling over.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to ease Russian worries, NATO negotiated a 1997 accord
with Russia, called the Founding Act, which set the terms of NATO
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that accord, the West indicated it had no plan, need
or intention to permanently station a substantial number of NATO
combat forces on the territory of its new members or to keep
nuclear weapons there. But the West stopped short of making that a
binding, legal commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also established a new NATO-Russian council, a
panel the Western alliance touted as a sign that Moscow was
adjusting itself, however painfully, to the realities of an
expanded NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the accord signaled little more than a temporary truce.
That is hardly surprising, for the debate also reflects Moscow's
deeper resentments over its loss of superpower status and over
American willingness to use its power in Iraq and Yugoslavia in the
face of Russia opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is not Poland, the Czech Republic or Hungary,''
said Toby T. Gati, a former assistant secretary of state in the
Clinton administration. ``The real issue is American power. What
the Russians do not like is that there is one country which has the
capability to act by itself and direct an alliance. NATO expansion
is not the defining issue, though it has left the Russians with a
bad taste.''

</P>
<P>
   The alliance's decision to expand, for example, is not the main
reason the Russian Parliament has yet to approve the Start II
strategic arms treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to ratify the accord has more to do with the U.S.
decision to bomb Iraq in December _ an attack that took place just
days before the accord was to be taken up by Russia's Parliament _
and President Clinton's surprise move to press ahead with the
testing and development of anti-missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   Even without NATO expansion, it is probably unlikely that Moscow
and Washington would be working in lock step, say, to thwart Iran's
nuclear ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Russian politicians who support reforms say the move
has taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the further isolation of Russia and has led to a
tendency here to be more critical of the United States,'' said
former Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov, a supporter of capitalist
reforms who is much admired in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been too weak to stymie the alliance's expansion
plans, but it has sought to fight a rear-guard effort. On Kosovo,
the Russians have insisted that no airstrikes be carried out
without the approval of the U.N. Security Council, where they hold
a veto.
</P>
<P>
   And President Boris Yeltsin personally warned the Americans to
keep their hands off Kosovo _ a warning that has psychologically
bolstered the Serbs in their refusal to accept NATO ground troops
in their battle-torn province.
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna, where negotiators from 30 nations are trying to
update the old East-West treaty limiting non-nuclear arms, the
Russians are seeking to blunt NATO by limiting the Western combat
forces that can be dispatched to the territory of its new members.
</P>
<P>
   Having promised not to station any permanent large contingent of
combat forces in Poland, the Czech Republic or Hungary as part of
the Founding Act, NATO says it needs the right to rush as many as
two combat divisions to any or each of those nations if a crisis
breaks out. The proposal for such emergency deployments is based on
a classified assessment of military requirements by NATO military
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sort of scenario we have in mind is a crisis short of
major aggression against the alliance, where all bets would be
off,'' a senior Western diplomat said. ``Let's say there was a
Serbian threat against Hungary. Then we want to be able to
reinforce. It might be hypothetical today, but it could become very
real if there was a Serbian decision to lash out at the
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians have insisted that the ceiling be set at one
division or even a brigade. They have informed NATO that they will
not send a top level representative to the Washington summit talks
if this matter is not worked out or if the two sides are at odds
over Kosovo, American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials say that Russia and NATO may yet come to terms
on the force limits. To make the West's proposal more palatable,
for example, the United States is privately encouraging Poland to
cut 200 more tanks from its arsenal than it had previously planned,
something Western officials say Poland can do by getting rid of old
models in storage.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has also told the Russians that it is willing to relax
limits on the number of Russian armored personnel carriers on its
southern flank, a region that greatly concerns Russia, as it
includes the volatile Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   And a number of senior diplomats, including Foreign Minister
Robin Cook of Britain, have assured Moscow that the alliance will
not use the Washington meeting to issue a new flurry of invitations
to potential NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this will be enough to induce Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov or Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to make the Washington
trip, as the Clinton administration would like, is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unlikely to change the basic stance among Russian
foreign-policy specialists toward the alliance. Sergei Rogov, the
director of the U.S.A.-Canada Institute, a research center on
Russian-Western relations, said it was possible the two sides could
learn to work together effectively, but added he was not
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that NATO is enlarging despite our objections and is
claiming the role of the dominant security organization in Europe
is perceived here as a negative,'' Rogov said. ``We are being
marginalized.''

<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia _ When Hugo Banzer was democratically elected
president in 1997, two decades after his military dictatorship,
most Bolivians seemed more interested in economic issues than in
past human-rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of 200 Bolivians during Banzer's rule from
1971 to 1978 was only a minor issue in the election campaign, by
which time the former general had largely succeeded in polishing
his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But then last October another former dictator, Gen. Augusto
Pinochet of neighboring Chile, was arrested in London on a Spanish
judge's charge that he had led an effort to kidnap and kill
leftists in five South American countries in the 1970s, and
Banzer's fortunes began to change.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators quickly massed outside the Spanish Embassy in La
Paz carrying signs that said ``Banzer to trial.'' Now he is being
besieged by allegations from local human-rights groups, the press
and even senior congressional members of his ruling coalition that
he knowingly participated in joint operations with the Chilean and
Argentine military governments _ as part of a larger regional
effort called Operation Condor _ that led to the deaths of at least
36 people.
</P>
<P>
   Past repression has not incited the same heated debate in this
Andean nation of 8 million people as in Chile and Argentina, in
large part because the scale of the human-rights abuses was far
smaller. But the charges and bad publicity are particularly
distracting and embarrassing for Banzer since they come at a time
when he is seeking to attract foreign investment and aid to bolster
one of South America's weakest economies.
</P>
<P>
   One leftist political party participating in Banzer's government
is going through a wrenching internal debate about whether to
supply the Spanish judge investigating Pinochet with evidence of
Bolivian involvement in Operation Condor that could eventually lead
to Banzer's indictment in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Banzer has repeatedly denied knowledge of Operation Condor, and
no firm evidence has yet been made public that links him directly
to any disappearances. But already the allegations that his
previous government coordinated operations with Pinochet have
jeopardized vital economic aid from Holland, Belgium and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Banzer's efforts in recent weeks to silence criticism
of his past performance as a dictator, both in the local media and
on the floor of the lower house of Congress, have opened questions
about his commitment to open government and democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Banzer's inability to accept criticism for his past
has reopened a wound,'' said Carlos Toranzo Roca, a leading
Bolivian political scientist and economist. ``It's not as painful a
wound as Chile's, but the entire episode is generating
complications for Banzer's government.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish judge trying to extradite
Pinochet from Great Britain, where he is now being held, has
gathered evidence linking Banzer's first government to the
kidnapping of seven Bolivians _ three student leaders, a
mining-union organizer and three guerrillas _ who were transferred
to Chile for execution.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinochet government was apparently interested in
interrogating the seven Bolivians because they previously had close
ties to members of the socialist government of President Salvador
Allende, which was overthrown in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Local human-rights activists and the head of the Bolivian
Chamber of Deputies' human-rights commission say a total of six
Argentines were picked up by Bolivian security forces here and
transferred to Argentina for execution. Meanwhile, they say a total
of 23 Bolivians disappeared while they were living in exile in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Condor was organized by the Chilean secret
intelligence service primarily to hunt down Chilean political
exiles living in neighboring countries. According to Garzon, the
military regimes of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and
Bolivia participated in the operation to eliminate their own
leftist activists, especially those living in exile.
</P>
<P>
   After he was overthrown in a military coup in 1978, Banzer shed
his uniform and dedicated himself to organizing a moderately
conservative party. The abuses during the first Banzer government
were largely forgotten by 1981 because of the repression of a much
harsher military regime that followed, led by Gen. Luis Garcia
Meza, who was strongly influenced by cocaine traffickers as well as
Klaus Barbie, a Nazi exile known as the Butcher of Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1985 presidential elections, Banzer won a narrow
plurality of the vote but was prevented from taking office by the
Congress. Rather than take the advice of party hard-liners who
pushed for a coup, Banzer accepted the results.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1997 election, the Banzer government has won strong
applause from the Clinton administration and U.N. officials for
starting an aggressive coca eradication campaign. But for all of
his effort to reform his image, the old ghosts are beginning to
return.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After Pinochet's arrest, La Prensa, a Bolivian daily newspaper,
began publishing a series of articles about Bolivia's role in
Operation Condor. Allies of Banzer quietly threatened to cut off
government advertising in the newspaper. Three reporters considered
unfriendly to the government were then dismissed, and the paper's
aggressive coverage stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolivian Chamber of Deputies overwhelmingly approved a
resolution Nov. 25 asking its human-rights panel to assemble
evidence on Bolivian involvement in Operation Condor and then hand
it over to Garzon. But after the commission came up with its
evidence, senior government officials lobbied hard against any
congressional transfer of documents to the Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Deputies reversed itself in a resolution Feb. 23.
It added, however, that the Revolutionary Leftist Movement, or MIR,
a government-aligned party that pushed for the original
congressional resolution, could offer Garzon the documentation.
</P>
<P>
   The party executive committee is now debating the issue, with
members in its left wing arguing that they cannot forget that three
of the seven Bolivians killed in Chile were members of the party.
That some current Banzer allies are seeking justice for dissidents
who opposed the first Banzer government shows how much politics has
changed here over the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hugo Carvajal, president of the Chamber of
Deputies, warned in an interview that if the government put strong
pressure on his party not to send the documents to Spain ``it will
generate friction in the governing coalition.'' Carvajal, who
himself was arrested and tortured as a student leader in the 1970s,
added, ``Historical memory is important, and this is a matter of
dignity, so I won't keep quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Informe R, a monthly magazine, published an entire
issue on Operation Condor that featured a collage cover showing
Pinochet with a portrait of Banzer in full military uniform hung on
a wall over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Editors of the magazine accused Interior Ministry agents of
trying to break into their offices to confiscate 1,000 issues
before they were delivered to newsstands, a charge the government
denies.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Guido Nayar Prado threatened to take the
magazine to court for defaming the president with a cover he
characterized as a fake. Embarrassed by the wide press coverage
that followed, Banzer told his minister to drop his threat.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Nayar Prado said, ``They put the pictures of
the two presidents together to fool readers into thinking that
Banzer and Pinochet were the same, which is a lie.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A spy worms his way into a delicate niche of U.S.
military intelligence. He steals its secrets and sells them to
another government. His treachery inflicts the gravest damage to
U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
   Another spook sets out to purloin a foreign government's trade
secrets. The foreign government smells a rat, sets a trap that
snares the spy, her boss, his deputy and two colleagues, and sends
them all packing.
</P>
<P>
   In the first case, the spy was Jonathan Pollard, working for
Israel. In the second case, the spies were the CIA's, their target
France. Both cases caused political thunderstorms. Like most
storms, they passed without permanently altering the landscape. The
United States and Israel remain close, and Washington and Paris are
amiable, after a fashion, a couple reconciled after an infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Now assume, as one well might, that China _ no ally _ has been
caught, red-handed, spying on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese-American has been fired from the Los Alamos nuclear
laboratory, suspected of swiping bomb blueprints, though he has
been charged with nothing. Beijing stands accused of suborning
Chinese-Americans for treason, using its embassies as dens of
espionage, filching a recipe for miniaturizing nukes.
</P>
<P>
   And the White House is being flayed by Republicans in Congress
(or running for president) who say the administration turned a
blind eye to Chinese military and intelligence threats, deep-sixed
the Los Alamos case and sold out national-security concerns to a
mercantile foreign policy driven by campaign-contributing
corporations and shady Chinese middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   The imagery goes beyond concerns that holes in the national
security fence were closed too slowly for America's own good. The
political charges are as powerful as tabloid headlines. Atom spies!
Nuclear scandal! Pusillanimous policymakers pussyfoot with Chicoms!
</P>
<P>
   What effect will this have on U.S. politics? Potentially plenty,
since a presidential campaign is looming, and exciting
foreign-policy issues are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   And what effect will this have on U.S. diplomacy, with a summit
coming between the world's most powerful and most populous nations?
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically zero,'' said Donald Gregg, a former CIA station
chief and ambassador in South Korea, and deputy national security
adviser to President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   James Lilley, a former CIA station chief and ambassador in
Beijing, said: ``Espionage is largely separate from the mainstream
of foreign policy. You compartment it, you keep demagoguery out of
it, you investigate, you nail the spy and you punish him, and you
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   And former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made a similar
point: ``We should be adult enough to understand that major
countries are going to be spying on us. I'm assuming that we are
spying on China. That should not in itself affect diplomatic
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, grow up, America. Stop acting shocked to
discover spies in the global Casbah. The world these days is driven
by money, not ideology. And national interests, not angels and
devils, are what motivate intelligence strategies and international
relations in general.
</P>
<P>
   So, these old hands say, the Los Alamos case should not derail
U.S. diplomacy; rather, it is likely to gradually decay into the
background of the continuous, contentious chatter between the
United States and the Middle Kingdom _ if diplomacy's logic
prevails. Still, they say, it could become a lightning rod and thus
draw a storm sufficient to change the weather in Washington and the
Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of human rights, trade, the Chinese aiming missiles
against Taiwan, Chinese views of future warfare _ put that into a
presidential campaign, and you have a problem,'' Lilley said.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger, who knows a thing or two about the interplay of
diplomacy and politics, said: ``We are drifting into a
confrontation because of our inability to connect our diplomatic
policy to public support. You cannot open a newspaper without
reading an attack on China. It's a nostalgia for confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   For those in search of enemies, China makes a decent target. Its
spy services, its army and its state industries all show
``exceptional interest'' in buying or stealing U.S. technology to
modernize its backward military, the Pentagon says. China spies on
the United States much as the Soviets did (it was the first to
penetrate the CIA with a long-time mole, Larry Wu-tai Chin, who
worked there from 1952 to 1981). Its nuclear weapons are capable,
at least in theory, of turning Los Angeles and Seattle into
smoking, radiating ruins.
</P>
<P>
   But how real is that threat? China's nuclear arsenal is not much
more potent than America's was when Mao Tse-tung took charge 50
years ago, and U.S. deterrent power is overwhelming. China has
perhaps two dozen weapons capable of striking the American
homeland. If the Chinese so much as twitch a trigger finger, the
Pentagon can vaporize their nuclear silos and their cities in one
fell swoop. And if the Chinese did indeed steal the trick of
miniaturizing nuclear weapons from Los Alamos, speeding the day
they can place several warheads on a single missile, there is no
evidence yet that they have figured out how to deploy that force in
a way that alters the strategic balance with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a smaller, smarter Chinese bomb could undercut U.S.
interests if it altered the balance of fear in Asia. Since
Hiroshima, nuclear weapons have proved far more useful as
instruments of blackmail _ or, more politely, symbols of strength _
than as military tools. When China rattles its shorter-range
missiles, Taiwan and Japan listen. A many-headed missile is a
talisman that would place China in the nuclear heavyweight class,
far beyond regional upstarts like India and Pakistan. And since the
Chinese have sold missile technology to Iran, a breakthrough for
Beijing may someday be marketed in Tehran.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A spy worms his way into a delicate niche of U.S.
military intelligence. He steals its secrets and sells them to
another government. His treachery inflicts the gravest damage to
U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
   Another spook sets out to purloin a foreign government's trade
secrets. The foreign government smells a rat, sets a trap that
snares the spy, her boss, his deputy and two colleagues, and sends
them all packing.
</P>
<P>
   In the first case, the spy was Jonathan Pollard, working for
Israel. In the second case, the spies were the CIA's, their target
France. Both cases caused political thunderstorms. Like most
storms, they passed without permanently altering the landscape. The
United States and Israel remain close, and Washington and Paris are
amiable, after a fashion, a couple reconciled after an infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Now assume, as one well might, that China _ no ally _ has been
caught, red-handed, spying on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese-American has been fired from the Los Alamos nuclear
laboratory, suspected of swiping bomb blueprints, though he has
been charged with nothing. Beijing stands accused of suborning
Chinese-Americans for treason, using its embassies as dens of
espionage, filching a recipe for miniaturizing nukes.
</P>
<P>
   And the White House is being flayed by Republicans in Congress
(or running for president) who say the administration turned a
blind eye to Chinese military and intelligence threats, deep-sixed
the Los Alamos case and sold out national-security concerns to a
mercantile foreign policy driven by campaign-contributing
corporations and shady Chinese middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   The imagery goes beyond concerns that holes in the national
security fence were closed too slowly for America's own good. The
political charges are as powerful as tabloid headlines. Atom spies!
Nuclear scandal! Pusillanimous policymakers pussyfoot with Chicoms!
</P>
<P>
   What effect will this have on U.S. politics? Potentially plenty,
since a presidential campaign is looming, and exciting
foreign-policy issues are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   And what effect will this have on U.S. diplomacy, with a summit
coming between the world's most powerful and most populous nations?
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically zero,'' said Donald Gregg, a former CIA station
chief and ambassador in South Korea, and deputy national security
adviser to President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   James Lilley, a former CIA station chief and ambassador in
Beijing, said: ``Espionage is largely separate from the mainstream
of foreign policy. You compartment it, you keep demagoguery out of
it, you investigate, you nail the spy and you punish him, and you
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   And former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made a similar
point: ``We should be adult enough to understand that major
countries are going to be spying on us. I'm assuming that we are
spying on China. That should not in itself affect diplomatic
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, grow up, America. Stop acting shocked to
discover spies in the global Casbah. The world these days is driven
by money, not ideology. And national interests, not angels and
devils, are what motivate intelligence strategies and international
relations in general.
</P>
<P>
   So, these old hands say, the Los Alamos case should not derail
U.S. diplomacy; rather, it is likely to gradually decay into the
background of the continuous, contentious chatter between the
United States and the Middle Kingdom _ if diplomacy's logic
prevails. Still, they say, it could become a lightning rod and thus
draw a storm sufficient to change the weather in Washington and the
Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of human rights, trade, the Chinese aiming missiles
against Taiwan, Chinese views of future warfare _ put that into a
presidential campaign, and you have a problem,'' Lilley said.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger, who knows a thing or two about the interplay of
diplomacy and politics, said: ``We are drifting into a
confrontation because of our inability to connect our diplomatic
policy to public support. You cannot open a newspaper without
reading an attack on China. It's a nostalgia for confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   For those in search of enemies, China makes a decent target. Its
spy services, its army and its state industries all show
``exceptional interest'' in buying or stealing U.S. technology to
modernize its backward military, the Pentagon says. China spies on
the United States much as the Soviets did (it was the first to
penetrate the CIA with a long-time mole, Larry Wu-tai Chin, who
worked there from 1952 to 1981). Its nuclear weapons are capable,
at least in theory, of turning Los Angeles and Seattle into
smoking, radiating ruins.
</P>
<P>
   But how real is that threat? China's nuclear arsenal is not much
more potent than America's was when Mao Tse-tung took charge 50
years ago, and U.S. deterrent power is overwhelming. China has
perhaps two dozen weapons capable of striking the American
homeland. If the Chinese so much as twitch a trigger finger, the
Pentagon can vaporize their nuclear silos and their cities in one
fell swoop. And if the Chinese did indeed steal the trick of
miniaturizing nuclear weapons from Los Alamos, speeding the day
they can place several warheads on a single missile, there is no
evidence yet that they have figured out how to deploy that force in
a way that alters the strategic balance with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a smaller, smarter Chinese bomb could undercut U.S.
interests if it altered the balance of fear in Asia. Since
Hiroshima, nuclear weapons have proved far more useful as
instruments of blackmail _ or, more politely, symbols of strength _
than as military tools. When China rattles its shorter-range
missiles, Taiwan and Japan listen. A many-headed missile is a
talisman that would place China in the nuclear heavyweight class,
far beyond regional upstarts like India and Pakistan. And since the
Chinese have sold missile technology to Iran, a breakthrough for
Beijing may someday be marketed in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now a clamor is rising for far tighter security at the national
laboratories like Los Alamos. Chinese espionage presents a unique
problem there. It exclusively uses ethnic Chinese operatives, in
large numbers, each supposed to gather a tiny piece of a puzzle.
``You are looking at an individual collecting one small part one
time, and you don't have the quality of case that our country will
take to prosecute as far as espionage,'' said one senior FBI
official _ which may explain why there have been no arrests in the
Los Alamos case.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis chills the spines of scientists and Sinophiles.
``We have a disproportionate dependence on foreign-born scientists
at the labs; they love to work here because it's an open society,
so they can do cutting-edge work in a congenial atmosphere,'' said
Chas. W. Freeman Jr., a diplomat in Beijing under President Ronald
Reagan and co-chairman of the U.S.-China Policy Foundation. ``So
will there now be a pall of suspicion against Chinese scientists?
Are we now going to have a witch hunt? If you ratchet it up and
exclude foreign-born scientists, what will that do to our
competitive edge?''
</P>
<P>
   The outlook wasn't sunny for the summit before the latest storm.
President Clinton still cannot find a new U.S. ambassador willing
to carry out his policies, a mix of mercantile zest and missionary
zeal. The Chinese have never been thrilled with the United States
slamming them for political repression, selling warplanes to their
archfoe Taiwan, embracing their old enemy Vietnam, and envisioning
a united Korea allied with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospects for China's most-favored-nation status and its
admission to the World Trade Organization won't improve if the
Clinton administration cannot find a way to speak bluntly in
private to the Chinese and publicly to the American people about
nukes and spooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people in the United States are busy spreading the `China
threat' fallacy and trying to find a new enemy for the United
States,'' said Chinese Ambassador Li Zhao-xing in a speech in
Washington in January. It evoked something that former Assistant
Defense Secretary Joseph Nye, now dean of the Kennedy School of
Government, said in 1995: ``If you treat China as an enemy, China
will become an enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy, like politics, is the art of the possible. Since the
Cold War, Americans have dreamt of engaging Chinese leaders who are
more like us than Marx or Mao. Still, it is hard to be a great
nation without a great enemy.

POLITICAL ANIMALS: GROWLING OVER DOGS' RIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   In cities and towns across the nation, a chorus of politically
influential voices cries out in unison: Woof!
</P>
<P>
   From leash laws to legislation to curb dangerous animals to
regulations limiting the number of dogs per household, canine
questions have become the new hot button of local politics. In New
York City, an effort to curb leashlessness escalated this month as
armed police were brought into what had been a Parks Department
offensive; 450 summonses have been issued in the last two weeks.
Dog owners compare themselves to Jews under Hitler, while the parks
commissioner snarls about ``dog terrorists.'' The city will soon
pass out cell phones to volunteers to snitch on leash violators.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions are equally pitched in Avon, Conn., where dog owners
are in revolt over not being able to let dogs run freely in a large
park. In Boston, pooper-scooper laws are a flashpoint. In Venice
Beach, Calif., a ban on dogs on the boardwalk is the issue. In St.
Petersburg, Fla., it is the process of determining which dogs are
too vicious to live. In Cheektowaga, N.Y., pooch lovers seethe at
the legal limit of three dogs per household. In Annapolis, Md., and
Highland Park, Mich., owners are infuriated over bans on pit bulls.
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis, Seattle, San Francisco and scores more cities,
people scream for more dog space in city parks. In Santa Fe, N.M.,
last year, a resident filed a $2 million suit against the city,
charging ``Gestapo-style'' enforcement of the leash law.
</P>
<P>
   Dog politics is decidedly local: State laws have little to say
about regulating Rover, and Washington almost nothing. The fight is
over local regulations, and it occurs in city, town and village
councils. But, according to the March issue of Governing, which
tracks trends in local government, the fights have all too much in
common.
</P>
<P>
   ``A seemingly innocuous proposal is quickly followed by a
response stunningly disproportionate to its weightiness in the
public policy arena,'' it said. ``If you thought taxes were the
only issue that made voters' blood boil, then you haven't had a dog
issue appear on the public agenda lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high-pitched emotions and the sharp polarization,
participants often liken dog issues to abortion. ``There is no
middle ground,'' said Fred Marquis, administrator of Pinellas
County, Fla., where the heated discussion has been over how to
determine if a dog is dangerous and worthy of being impounded. ``As
with abortion, people are either totally opposed or totally
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Lea Benjamin, a former dog trainer who now writes novels
about a detective who is accompanied by a pit bull, agreed:
``There's no way you can have a calm discussion about this with
anybody. It's like talking about religion. At the end of 10 hours,
nobody's mind is going to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversies are not fueled by an increase in dogs.
Although the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association
expects an increase in a census it is now preparing, the estimated
number of dogs in the country two years ago, 54.6 million, was
virtually the same as in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed, according to James Weverka, president of the
National Animal Control Association, is that dogs in recent years
have gotten larger, are more likely to be guard dogs and tend to be
confined in smaller spaces by working people who spend less time
with them. Upshot: dogs that seem more threatening roam limited
public spaces, whose owners are more likely to treat them
indulgently.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Weverka _ who serves as animal control manager in
Lincoln, Neb., where a dog catcher was recently beaten by an irate
owner _ says the view of dogs has changed fundamentally from the
time when they were prized for herding or hunting. The increase in
the number of people living alone, including older people whose
children have left the roost, may be a factor. ``There's now a
feeling that dogs are members of the family,'' he said. ``A member
of the family would never bite or attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The love people feel for their furry best friends is suggested
by the stuff the 28.5 million dog owners buy their pets as
Christmas presents. A new apartment tower being built in
Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood will offer a ``doggie bar,'' with
water and treats for pups, and ``doghouse room service,'' providing
milk, bottled water and gourmet dog food. The feeling is almost
parental: Ms. Benjamin says that in 20 years as a dog trainer, she
routinely addressed owners as mommy or daddy, and was never
corrected. But to psychiatrists the attachments may be deeper
still.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth Skodnek, chairman of the psychiatry and psychology
department at Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow, N.Y.,
suggested that dog owners perceive their pets as an extension of
themselves. ``They take everything the pet does or doesn't do very
personally,'' he said. ``If the pet is criticized, they feel
criticized.'' But he said it may be more than even that. ``Pet
owners allow their pets to do things they wouldn't do themselves,''
he said. ``The pet gives them a chance to feel free.''
</P>
<P>
   Such feelings add ferocity and flair to the dog owners'
presentations. At an Avon, Conn., town meeting last summer, more
than 400 showed up with leashes around their necks. They called a
plan to bar dogs from running free in 230-acre Fisher Meadows Park
a crime against nature, and vowed disobedience. But the ban was
supported in a September referendum. Now, Phil Schenck, the town
manager, wants to bring the warring groups together, perhaps to
find some smaller park area where dogs can go at certain times.
``You need to take the emotion out of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the ban are clearly in the majority, Schenck said.
Similarly, the New York City Parks Department says that user
surveys of parks favored by dog users show that most people in the
parks do not come with dogs; it adds that mail is running more than
3-to-1 in favor of its crackdown. In particular, people are irked
that dog owners berate low-paid park rangers, often minorities, as
Nazis, give them names like Eva Braun and exultantly unleash their
dogs after an enforcer goes around the corner. A typical letter:
``I have yet to see a dog owner take anything other than a position
of righteous indignation when someone objected.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate question, perhaps, is what is a dog? Under English
common law, dogs were considered valueless, mere providers of
pleasure as opposed to livestock, which were considered property.
But thinkers from Homer to Freud have invested canines with deeper
importance _ in the same vein as today's dog defenders.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's ultimate aim is not to eliminate pooches but
persuade people to look down on leash-law violators _ just as
people now complain about smokers in restaurants. ``Unleashed dogs
are violating human rights,'' said Parks Commissioner Henry Stern,
owner of Boomer the (leashed) Wonder Dog.

   In the aftermath of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, people are
wondering what can be done to prevent such a mess from ever
occurring again. For one thing, both major parties are poised to
eliminate, or at least eviscerate, the Office of the Independent
Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But how about an Office of the Independent  &UR; Counselor &LR;  instead?
Some experts suggest that to address the problem of people in the
White House who can't control their darker impulses, the country
needs a shrink on call for Chief Executives, their families and top
aides.
</P>
<P>
   The point was underscored by George Stephanopoulos' revelation
in a new memoir last week that he received psychiatric help and
mood-elevating medication to treat anxiety and depression while
Clinton spin doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental and emotional health treatment is the last political
taboo,'' said Stephanopoulos. ``That was one of the reasons I
resisted seeking help, for fear it would get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Stephanopoulos exhibited classic avoidance behavior when
asked if he would lobby for an Executive Shrink. The White House
also declined to comment on the notion _ even though the Clinton
administration has championed greater access to mental health care
for all Americans, and the president himself has sought counseling
for his problems from clergymen.
</P>
<P>
   Does the notion of an on-call White House shrink seem all that
crazy, in light of the burdens of the presidency and today's
confessional culture?
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to psycho-biographers to ponder whether a White House
psychiatrist could have helped President Clinton curb
self-destructive tendencies. Or if a shrink could have alleviated
President Richard M. Nixon's palpable paranoia, or soothed a
war-haunted President Lyndon B. Johnson. But Fred Greenstein, a
former president of the International Society for the Study of
Political Psychology, considers the presidency too important to be
deprived of immediate psychological support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you rather have someone who is untreated with his finger
on the button or someone who had some place to vent?'' asked
Greenstein, adding a line from Hamlet: `` `Madness in great ones
must not unwatched go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gilbert, a professor of politics at Northeastern
University and author of ``The Mortal Presidency: Illness and
Anguish in the White House'' (1992), seconds Greenstein's opinion.
He says the White House medical office _ already staffed by five
full-time doctors _ could easily include a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``As attitudes towards mental dysfunction change, presidents
might find mental health specialists in the White House
increasingly useful,'' writes Gilbert. ``They would be able to
receive treatment for psychological distress in a routine way, and
the country might be spared an emotionally disabled or impaired
chief executive.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear not. Even now, if a president were to suddenly suffer a
severe breakdown, a helicopter filled with security-cleared
psychiatrists would likely land on the White House lawn faster than
you could say, ``So tell me, how long have you been feeling this
way?''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Amy Weiss said the president
can already avail himself of a number of specialists, including a
psychiatrist, at Bethesda Naval Hospital, where presidents undergo
annual physical exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president should receive the same type of medical care
that everybody else receives,'' said Dr. Lawrence Mohr, a White
House physician during the Reagan, Bush and Clinton
administrations. Nevertheless, Mohr expressed apprehension about
turning the White House ``into a hospital,'' and saw no reason to
hire a full-time presidential psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did former President Gerald R. Ford. ``I don't see the need
for someone in that discipline being assigned specifically to the
White House medical office,'' said Ford. ``I think I was normal. I
think I am still normal. If I had any problem along that line
develop, the White House can acquire the best almost
instantaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether presidents should undergo a mandatory
psychological exam as part of their annual physical, former
President Jimmy Carter replied: ``No, you don't have a mandatory
requirement in the law to check a president for athlete's foot.''
But he added, ``I believe that mental illness should be considered
with the same import as physical illness.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an unfulfilled wish. Despite Clinton's plea during his
last State of the Union Address that ``no American should ever be
afraid to address'' mental illness, and despite the public's
embrace of ``Analyze This,'' the new mobster-in-therapy hit, there
is considerable doubt over whether Americans are ready to accept a
president on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that it may be fine for a mafia boss to have
self-doubts, but not presidents of the United States,'' said Andrew
Kohut, director of the Pew Center for the People and the Press.
``The public wants presidents to steer straight ahead and not look
back, not over-think his hang-ups. The ghost of Thomas Eagleton
still haunts us.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Eagleton was the Democratic senator from Missouri who was
dumped from George McGovern's 1972 presidential ticket over the
disclosure that he had been hospitalized for depression and
received electro-shock therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagleton experience notwithstanding, some say a president
who owned up to psychotherapy might be able to engender public
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than call it a mental health problem, I would couch it
in familial terms,'' suggested Henry Sheinkopf, a Democratic
political consultant. ``If you say my president has a problem that
required counseling because he wanted to protect his family and
children, that's much more palatable. Still, the idea of their
leaders needing help is tough for many Americans to tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   And it worries Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. ``The signal to the
world that the American president, the leader of the free world, is
having to get advice as to his mental condition might destabilize a
lot of things, including stock markets and negotiations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security adviser, said
there would have to be precautions against a
free-associator-in-chief divulging secrets. ``The psychiatrist
would also probably have to sign a document obligating him to raise
an alarm if he detected serious problems that could affect the
president's ability to govern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if White House doctors judge the president incapable of
performing his duties, they can alert the vice president, who can
then invoke the 25th Amendment. It gives the vice president, backed
by a majority of the Cabinet, the power to remove a disabled
president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Brzezinski, however, said the practical concerns of leadership
could render a White House psychiatrist pretty useless. ``My guess
is that these therapists would be sitting there for four years and
never see the president,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Justin Frank, a Washington, D.C., psychiatrist, who
volunteered in an interview to be the first First Shrink, admits
that the doctor-president relationship might be challenging. ``A
therapist would have to be flexible about makeup sessions,'' said
Frank.
</P>
<P>
   And would the president have the right to know whether his ally
by the 50-minute hour were a Democrat or a Republican?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' said Frank, ``but I would have the right not to tell
him.''

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Announcing her presidential exploratory
committee here last week, Elizabeth Dole invoked the last
Republican hero, Ronald Reagan. Three days earlier, presenting his
own committee in Austin, Texas Gov. George W. Bush mentioned the
first Republican hero, Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Neither made even a reference to two of the biggest names in
Republican politics today, who also happen to be their most
prominent supporters: former Sen. Bob Dole and former President
George Bush, respectively. Both were conspicuously absent from the
events. The closest Dole came to appearing with his wife was in one
of seven blown-up photographs that served as the backdrop. (Reagan
got equal billing: There was a photograph of him and Mrs. Dole.)
</P>
<P>
   A Bush or a Dole has appeared on every Republican presidential
ticket since 1976. But by distancing themselves from their famous
family members, the latest Bush and Dole candidates to seek the
White House demonstrate the complications _ the drawbacks as well
as advantages _ of belonging to political dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their individual accomplishments, Mrs. Dole and Bush
would not be such hot tickets _ they are swamping the GOP field in
early polls _ were it not for their pedigrees. Behind the scenes,
they have been eagerly tapping into their families' extended
financial and political networks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the obligatory questions by reporters about his father,
Bush repeated his well-practiced reply after his announcement last
week: ``I inherited half his friends and all his enemies. I'm
working on the other half of his friends _ and trying to peel off a
few of his enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the voters who regard the Bush and Dole names as famous,
others view them as infamous. So the two newest national contenders
are forced to make a purely political calculation: How closely do
they want to be identified with losers? Who can forget that Dole,
the former Senate Republican leader, suffered a humiliating defeat
to President Clinton in 1996? Or that former President Bush was
ousted from office by him in 1992?
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is very straightforward, to try to get all the
benefits of the famous name _ and none of the negatives,'' said
Nelson Warfield, Dole's press secretary in the 1996 campaign. ``The
spotlight would not be nearly as bright for Elizabeth if her last
name were Doyle. But any losing campaign leaves bad memories, so
too much deja Dole can hurt her.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are sensitive to the suggestion that they are
riding on familial coattails. Bush, who earned $14 million from a
minority investment in the Texas Rangers baseball team, is a widely
popular governor in his own right; Mrs. Dole served in five
administrations, twice in the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Both are determined not to be compared with the Kennedys, whose
patriarch, Joseph Kennedy, was perceived as prodding his sons into
politics. Americans ``are a robustly anti-dynastic culture,'' said
Tony Dolan, Reagan's former chief speech writer, who recently met
with the elder Bush in Texas. ``George W. has to make clear that he
doesn't think he has a right to inheritance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole's newly hired pollster, Linda DiVall, distinguished
her candidate from another spouse of a famous politician _ Hillary
Rodham Clinton _ who is toying with running for the U.S. Senate
from New York. ``She is not running because she is the spouse or
out of any sense of entitlement _ or what we see with Hillary
Clinton,'' Ms. DiVall said. ``And there's no attempt to hide him.
But she needs to establish her individual identity.''
</P>
<P>
   In personality alone, the candidates cannot be accused of being
spinoffs of their more celebrated _ in some cases, scorned _ kin.
Mrs. Dole, who has never been elected to office, is a regimented
perfectionist; her husband, a veteran politician, is known for his
looser, seat-of-the-pants approach.
</P>
<P>
   Bristling at contrasts to his father, Bush cited his distinct
upbringing and achievements. ``I went to Sam Houston Elementary
School in Midland, Texas,'' he said last week. ``And he went to
Greenwich Country Day in Connecticut. I married Laura; he married
Barbara. He was never a governor, and, therefore, it's hard to get
an apples-to-apples comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   But comparisons are inevitable, particularly since both
candidates have refused to answer questions about their positions
on crucial national and international matters. That has left their
rivals to fill in the blanks. Naming no names, two familiar
presidential candidates, Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes, himself
the scion of publishing tycoon Malcolm Forbes, recently sought to
get at the son by condemning the father's promise of a ``kinder and
gentler'' nation.
</P>
<P>
   Voters have been left to assume _ rightly or wrongly _ that Gov.
Bush's and Mrs. Dole's philosophies do not diverge appreciably from
that of former President Bush or Dole. Despite the governor's
popularity in the polls, for example, surveys continue to show that
many Republicans confuse Bush with his father. And in random
interviews at Republican events, participants who favor abortion
rights often remark that Bush's anti-abortion stand was tolerable
because they remembered that his father once was on their side.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Mrs. Dole and Bush to define themselves has left
Republicans searching for hints. That Richard Darman, President
Bush's budget director, has been nowhere to be seen in his son's
organization has sent a signal that the governor has a more
conservative economic philosophy. Many conservatives blame Darman
for talking the president into the politically fatal tax increase
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   From the opposite perspective, many conservatives groused last
week about Mrs. Dole's hiring of Ms. DiVall because she has worked
for Planned Parenthood and the National Education Association,
which are seen as liberal organizations. (Ms. DiVall says she has
also had many conservatives on her client roster, including Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.) In
assembling a staff, Mrs. Dole has pointedly reached beyond her
husband's advisers from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, one of Bush's top supporters, state Sen. Thurman
Gaskill, said voters should not expect the governor to campaign
alongside his father. Gaskill, who was also a big backer of the
elder Bush, explained, ``Conservatives always had some reservations
with President Bush, and that's who the governor has to appeal to.
He wants to make them feel a little more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their determination to break free, Bush and Mrs. Dole
can take heart that Vice President Al Gore, the current Democratic
front-runner, dare not attack them for their lineage. After Gore
was picked as Clinton's running mate in 1992, his father, former
Sen. Albert Gore Sr., D-Tenn., remarked that his namesake was
destined for the White House, saying, ``He was raised for it.''

   In personality alone, the candidates cannot be accused of being
spinoffs of their more celebrated _ in some cases, scorned _ kin.
Mrs. Dole, who has never been elected to office, is a regimented
perfectionist; her husband, a veteran politician, is known for his
looser, seat-of-the-pants approach.
</P>
<P>
   Bristling at contrasts to his father, Bush cited his distinct
upbringing and achievements. ``I went to Sam Houston Elementary
School in Midland, Texas,'' he said last week. ``And he went to
Greenwich Country Day in Connecticut. I married Laura; he married
Barbara. He was never a governor, and, therefore, it's hard to get
an apples-to-apples comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   But comparisons are inevitable, particularly since both
candidates have refused to answer questions about their positions
on crucial national and international matters. That has left their
rivals to fill in the blanks. Naming no names, two familiar
presidential candidates, Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes, himself
the scion of publishing tycoon Malcolm Forbes, recently sought to
get at the son by condemning the father's promise of a ``kinder and
gentler'' nation.
</P>
<P>
   Voters have been left to assume _ rightly or wrongly _ that Gov.
Bush's and Mrs. Dole's philosophies do not diverge appreciably from
that of former President Bush or Dole. Despite the governor's
popularity in the polls, for example, surveys continue to show that
many Republicans confuse Bush with his father. And in random
interviews at Republican events, participants who favor abortion
rights often remark that Bush's anti-abortion stand was tolerable
because they remembered that his father once was on their side.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Mrs. Dole and Bush to define themselves has left
Republicans searching for hints. That Richard Darman, President
Bush's budget director, has been nowhere to be seen in his son's
organization has sent a signal that the governor has a more
conservative economic philosophy. Many conservatives blame Darman
for talking the president into the politically fatal tax increase
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   From the opposite perspective, many conservatives groused last
week about Mrs. Dole's hiring of Ms. DiVall because she has worked
for Planned Parenthood and the National Education Association,
which are seen as liberal organizations. (Ms. DiVall says she has
also had many conservatives on her client roster, including Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.) In
assembling a staff, Mrs. Dole has pointedly reached beyond her
husband's advisers from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, one of Bush's top supporters, state Sen. Thurman
Gaskill, said voters should not expect the governor to campaign
alongside his father. Gaskill, who was also a big backer of the
elder Bush, explained, ``Conservatives always had some reservations
with President Bush, and that's who the governor has to appeal to.
He wants to make them feel a little more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their determination to break free, Bush and Mrs. Dole
can take heart that Vice President Al Gore, the current Democratic
front-runner, dare not attack them for their lineage. After Gore
was picked as Clinton's running mate in 1992, his father, former
Sen. Albert Gore Sr., D-Tenn., remarked that his namesake was
destined for the White House, saying, ``He was raised for it.''

   Good science often starts with flights of imagination that are
all but unknown publicly. That's because the creative process ends
in scientific reports cast to seem as dry and objective as
possible. All the same, history shows scientists driven by visions
not only wild in their own day, but sometimes still audacious.
</P>
<P>
   Johannes Kepler, who discovered that the planets move in
elliptical paths around the Sun, was motivated by a mystical love
of musical harmonies. Friedrich August Kekule, a founder of organic
chemistry, told of hitting on the ring structure of benzene after a
dream in which a snake curled itself into a loop. Ernest
Rutherford, inspired by the majesty of the solar system, proposed a
model of the atom in which electrons orbit around a central
nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   Today, science is toying quietly with the notion that all
terrestrial life came from Mars _ that we, in effect, are the
Martians.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that billions of years ago, life arose first on the
red planet, probably dotted back then with blue lakes and seas.
Cosmic collisions sent the alien slimes and microbes flying on
rocky debris through space like so many windblown seeds until they
fell to Earth and flourished, in time producing such specimens as
Monica Lewinsky and Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound goofy. But supporting evidence, if sketchy, has
been growing steadily for a decade. So Aliens ``R'' Us is a hot
topic. Scientists even plan to address the issue experimentally as
Mars probes costing many billions of dollars swing into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can tell, nearly everybody believes it's
plausible,'' said Joseph Burns, a planetary scientist at Cornell
University. ``Who knows? Maybe we are the little green men.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rummel, a top NASA biologist who explores the
extraterrestrial life issue, agreed. ``It's a fascinating
question,'' he said, adding that scientists in the next few years
may find that Martians and Earthlings are ``really the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The wilder dreams of science are seldom aired in public. When
they are, the unveiling tends to be done by superstars, not the
rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Sagan, the late astronomer and science author, in his 1994
book, ``Pale Blue Dot'' (Random House), asked gingerly if the
Earthly tree of life could have arisen from Martian seeds, if the
two planets ``regularly exchanged life-forms'' over the ages.
</P>
<P>
   So too, Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of DNA's structure, in
his 1981 book, ``Life Itself'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), broached the
more general idea that primitive life came to Earth from somewhere
in outer space, a notion known as panspermia.
</P>
<P>
   Behind such musings lies a problem of logic that has grown more
unsettling in recent years. The time appears to have been very
short between the end of the lethal bombardment of the young Earth
by all kinds of planetary crud and building blocks (the same blitz
that pockmarked the Moon) and the start of terrestrial life. By
some estimates, the two events were nearly simultaneous, leaving no
time for the slow twists and turns of biologic evolution. So
scientists often look to the heavens for answers.
</P>
<P>
   As a birthplace, Mars seems increasingly apt. Though cold and
dry today, it is thought to have been wetter and warmer long ago. A
growing number of scientists argue that it was far more habitable
than the early Earth, if only because its small size made it less
of a target for cosmic intruders big enough to wipe out all
rudimentary life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being out when the hunters are drunk,'' said Norman
Sleep, a geophysicist at Stanford University who sees Mars as the
cradle of life. ``You're better off being a rabbit than a deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Also wowing Mars fans is the discovery that cosmic smashups of
an ordinary sort have sent hundreds of tons of the distant planet
falling to Earth. Experts estimate that a Mars rock lands as often
as every three days, and that billions have done so over time _
even though only 13 of them have been identified so far.
</P>
<P>
   The rain of debris from Mars was hardest, experts agree, in the
Earth's early days. And the reverse trip was far less likely
because the Sun pulls Earth debris away from Mars and toward
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Burns of Cornell and his colleagues, using big computers to
track likely paths of Mars debris, made news in 1996 by showing
that the trek to Earth through the wilds of outer space could be as
short as a few months. ``We were stunned to see how easily this
material moves around,'' Burns remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists see other tantalizing clues. Some forms of
terrestrial life, they note, can withstand dangerously high levels
of radiation _ the main bar to unprotected life surviving the
rigors of outer space.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, scientists reported that Deinococcus radiodurans, a
microbe often found around nuclear reactors, could easily handle a
dose 3,000 times stronger than what would kill a human. A riddle is
why the microbe's skills evolved, since Earth apparently never
experienced such high levels of radiation. Could it be that it came
from somewhere in space where radiation is much higher?
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, scientists hope to settle the Aliens
``R'' Us question once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Mars probes are already returning stunning photos. NASA hopes to
find Martian life, either fossil or extant, and return samples of
it to Earth by 2008 for detailed analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, scientists say, we may finally find ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four years ago, this wasn't a live issue,'' said
Sleep. ``Now everybody is thinking about the possibility.''

   ESPIONAGE-DIPLOMACY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Although the Chinese
nuclear spying scandal may have a big impact on U.S. politics, it
is not likely to have a significant effect on U.S. diplomacy with
China. Espionage is largely separate from mainstream foreign
policy, and, after all, all countries spy on each other. By Tim

   IRISH-POLS-REVIEW (Chicago) _ There seems to be truth in the

<P>
   BUSH-DOLE-REVIEW (Des Moines) _ For all their individual
accomplishments, Elizabeth Dole and George W. Bush would not be
such hot tickets were it not for their pedigrees. But by distancing
themselves from their famous family members, they demonstrate the
complications _ the drawbacks as well as advantages _ of belonging
to political dynasties. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   WHITE-HOUSE-PSYCH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some political
psychologists and political scientists recommend the appointment of
a White House shrink on call for presidents, their families and
senior staff members. The presidency is too important a job to be
deprived of easy access to professional psychological support. By
David Wallis.

   CADILLAC-RACING-REVIEW (Detroit) _ A look at the off-beat _ and
sometimes off-key _ efforts to build a new, sprier reputation for

next year at Le Mans, the venerable French race in which entrants
try to drive as many times around a track as possible in 24 hours.
By Keith Bradsher.

<P>
   LABOR-CORRUPTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the difficulties
at ferreting out corruption among labor union leaders. One reason
that some union leaders have been able to jack up their salaries to
excessive levels is that it is often hard for members to find out
exactly what those salaries are. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   JOB-TITLES-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Clinton administration may
have reinvented the federal work force by cutting nearly 400,000
lower-level jobs, but it has also reinforced an already top-heavy
bureaucracy with more layers of lavishly titled upper-level
officials. By Stephen Labaton.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Throughout its modern history, Germany has wrestled
with the trauma of being ``das Land der Mitte'' _ ``the country in
the middle.'' From Bismarck to former Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
leaders sought to anchor and secure the state in its uneasy
geographical position between East and West.
</P>
<P>
   With Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary in NATO, that long,
sometimes disastrous struggle appears to have come to an end. For
the first time since Germany was unified in 1871, it finds itself
surrounded by allies. Long exposed, Germany is abruptly cocooned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since World War II, we have always strived to be surrounded by
friends rather than foes or cold foes,'' said Michael Steiner, the
chief diplomatic adviser to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. ``So for
us this is a hugely positive development.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits have been immediate for the often strained
relations between Germany and the Czech Republic. Schroeder used
the occasion of this month's visit by the Czech prime minister,
Milos Zeman, to announce that Germany would never seek compensation
on behalf of more than two million Sudeten Germans driven out of
what was Czechoslovakia at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Zeman, in turn, said for the first time that the 1945 laws that
led to that expulsion were defunct, although he stopped short of
questioning the legitimacy of the decrees _ a central demand of the
powerful Sudeten German lobby, but something that the Czechs would
never concede, because the often brutal expulsion had the Allies'
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Shared NATO membership was a decisive element in this act of
German-Czech reconciliation. It clearly opened the way for the
Czechs to feel at last that they were dealing with the Germans as
equals, and no longer had reason to feel threatened by a
neighboring power that has often appeared overbearing. In this way,
membership in the same alliance has eased old suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   For Bismarck, who understood that his unification of Germany had
upset the balance of power in Europe, it was clear that other
European powers ``hate and envy us.'' The only answer for Germany,
Bismarck believed, lay in a web of intricate alliances _ including
one with Russia _ that would stave off the specter of isolation.
</P>
<P>
   For Hitler, the answer to ``the German question'' lay in the use
of crushing force to ``restore the thousand-year-old historical
unity of German living space.'' And for postwar leaders,
traumatized by the cataclysm of the Third Reich and confronted by
the Cold War, Germany had to balance a firm anchoring in the West
with the slow eastward-looking seduction called ``Ostpolitik'' that
ultimately led to German unification in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   So today, things look simpler for Europe's largest power. At the
price of giving up lands that were long German (those parts of
Prussia and Silesia that now lie in Poland), Germany has gained
something long elusive _ stable borders.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, it has nine neighbors that all have the
appearance of being friends, even if the new post-Communist allies
are still struggling to overcome not only decades of Marxist rule,
but the ghosts of German occupation in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Germany's dominant place at the heart of Europe has
perhaps never been so secure. Yet despite a sense that a long
post-war struggle has been fruitfully concluded, the German mood is
scarcely one of elation as the country prepares to move its capital
almost 400 miles eastward to Berlin from Bonn, placing its
political center close to its new constellation of allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at last surrounded by friends,'' said Karl Kaiser, a
leading foreign policy expert, ``but we are not surrounded by
stability. How can there be stability when Russia is in a state of
decomposition? An overriding goal of a united Germany will
therefore remain to project stability eastward.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's government wants to do this in two ways: by bringing
the three countries that have now joined NATO into the European
Union as soon as possible, and by ensuring that NATO's nascent but
troubled partnership with Russia survives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Russia is not in NATO does not mean that it is
an outsider,'' Steiner said. ``Germany's absolute priority is to
work with it as a partner, or we will all pay a heavy price.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Germany's twin eastward-looking policy goals are rooted in solid
economic, as well as strategic, considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the European Union, Poland and the Czech Republic _
unlike Hungary, both neighbors _ provide Germany with ever stiffer
competition, tempting German factories to move there and make use
of much cheaper labor. German banks, meanwhile, have heavy exposure
to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But both policies face difficulties. Germany has argued that in
order to admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the
European Union, wide-ranging reform of the union's budget must
first be completed.
</P>
<P>
   These reforms are centered on changing a European agricultural
policy that accounts for 60 percent of European Union spending and
would become hopelessly expensive with the admission of the three
new states.
</P>
<P>
   Although an outline accord has been reached, the beneficiaries
of the existing policy _ particularly France _ remain wary, and
have not been averse to playing on historical fears of a dominant
Germany to paint Schroeder's campaign for reform as menacing. The
fact that Germany would benefit financially from the reform has
fueled this attack, which has amounted to an epidemic of
Germany-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately, in Paris, the question became one of not being
dominated by Germany again,'' said Werner Weidenfeld, the director
of a Munich-based foreign policy institute. ``But if you take a
long-term view of Europe, enlargement of the European Union
eastward is essential and cannot be done without budget reform.''
</P>
<P>
   With Russia there are also problems. Now that the long-pacifist
Greens are in the government, Schroeder and Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer, who leads the Greens, have tried to allay any
American concerns about Germany's commitment to NATO, and strongly
backed the possible use of force in Kosovo. This has angered
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, in turn, finds it more difficult than any other
European power to cope with the current political vacuum in Russia,
to which it is more acutely exposed than European nations farther
west.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot deter a vacuum, and you cannot really negotiate
with it either,'' said Stephen Holmes, a professor of politics at
Princeton University. ``Nobody is more concerned than the Germans
by the fact that you have weapons that can destroy the planet in
Russia being guarded by people earning $5 a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Germany has a new buffer to Russia _ Poland _ which Germans,
as all other NATO allies, are committed to defend. That alone
illustrates its shift _ from a land in the middle of an unstable
Europe to the largest European power in the middle of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Not even such a dramatic strategic change, however, can entirely
calm German fears of the Russian shadow _ a geographic ghost that
can perhaps never be entirely vanquished.
</P>
<P>
   As the British historian A.J.P. Taylor said of 19th-century
Germany: ``The German problem never changed in the deepest sense.
Occupying the center of the continent, she was bound to bear the
brunt of any war between Russia and the West, whichever side she
chose.''  &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Monir was hardly among the huddled, hungry masses of
Bangladesh when he arrived at Kennedy International Airport three
years ago. His father was an engineer; everyone expected Monir
would go to college and study accounting.
</P>
<P>
   What drove him from home was neither poverty nor war, just the
sure specter of a dead-end future. Back in Dhaka, all but the
wealthiest toiled through college only to hunt in vain for decent
jobs. At 15, Monir took flight, in search of an American education,
another life.
</P>
<P>
   Now 18 and still struggling through his sophomore year of high
school, Monir works late every night, packing takeout orders of
Thai food. The fear of failure follows him like a ghost. It is
there when he cannot get to school on time, when he realizes how
far behind he is on his homework, when he spots a classmate who
dropped out a while back, handing out fliers for an Indian
restaurant in the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have those worries,'' Monir confesses quietly. ``Maybe I'll
end up like him.''
</P>
<P>
   They are elusive to official institutions, but youngsters like
Monir are everywhere. They deliver pizza on rickety bicycles. They
cut flower stems at the corner grocery. They peddle fake-label
watches on the sidewalks of Manhattan and sprint at the sight of
the police.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several years, a small but growing number of
teen-agers _ virtually all boys, some as young as 14 or 15 _ have
arrived without their parents, much like the child immigrants of a
century ago. Once here, they become New York's youngest immigrant
workers, their cheap, nimble labor easily absorbed by the city's
thriving service economy.
</P>
<P>
   They come from countries where the poor go to work young. They
know they are trading one hard life for another, but at least this
one seems to come with some options. Here, on their own, they are
free as birds, and yet they are trapped in an underground ruled in
large measure by fear _ of the immigration authorities, child
welfare agencies, smugglers, thugs and bosses, past and potential.
(That is why all of the youngsters interviewed for this article
would give only their first names; some refused to be
photographed.)
</P>
<P>
   And immigration scholars and social workers wonder if they will
ever be able to break free. Most are in this country illegally _
and with rare exception, seem destined to remain so. Many come for
education, and its promise of opportunity unimaginable in Dhaka, or
whatever place they left behind. And yet, working long, hard hours
to stay alive, they often find themselves too tired and tied down,
and simply too poor, to get the education they need to move beyond
the margins of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they are like a lot of new immigrants. And yet they
are not _ because they are children, and they are alone.
</P>
<P>
   Just how many there are cannot be known, but the few
institutions that encounter them offer piecemeal evidence of their
growing presence. The Immigration and Naturalization Service
reports a fivefold increase in the number of unaccompanied minors
entering the country illegally over the last five years. In fiscal
year 1998, the agency had 4,284 such children in detention, the
vast majority between 15 and 18. Officials say they expect many
more to come from parts of Central America ravaged by Hurricane
Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chinatown Health Center, doctors report seeing many more
children coming alone, especially from Fujian Province, over the
last four years. English teachers at The Door, a youth center in
Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, say they have seen rising numbers of
teen-agers coming alone from Mexico and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really spiked, starting about three years ago,'' says
Christopher Ambrose, the center's co-director. `'It's just
incredible to me that they're doing what they're doing all by
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ranks of teen-age immigrants to the city was a young
man from Guinea named Amadou Diallo, whose American adventure began
three years ago at age 19 and ended last month when, unarmed, he
was killed by the police at the door to his apartment building in
the Bronx. There are boys like Francisco, from Mexico, who run away
defiantly, and those like Abdoulaye, from Senegal, who come with
their parents' blessings. There are those like Monir who live on
their own, perhaps with a roommate, and those who are taken in by
relatives, like Jian, a Fujianese farmer's son, who shares a
two-room tenement in Chinatown with an uncle and eight other men.
</P>
<P>
   All are keenly, constantly aware of the gulf between them and
the young people around them _ many of them also poor, many also
immigrants, but none quite so peculiarly alone. Jian is struck by
this every time he runs into schoolmates from Qianyang, his village
outside the city of Fuzhou. If they work, it is not to pay the
rent. Their parents take care of that, and harangue them to finish
their homework so they do not have to work in sweatshops all their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Jian invited his old best friend over to his apartment,
and his friend gasped. ``He said, `I can't imagine you live here,'
'' Jian recalls. ``We are like strangers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Francisco's day begins in the blue light before dawn, as the
steel accordion gates of a lower Manhattan diner roll open for
business. Francisco's territory is the grill, where he hovers over
burgers and BLT's. To his left sits a vat of gurgling hot oil that
has pocked his arms with a trail of burns. A Yankees cap shields
his boyish, blessedly acne-free face.
</P>
<P>
   Except Sundays, when he makes sandwiches at another deli, this
is Francisco's world all week, from 4:30 a.m. till 3:30 p.m. After
work, there are lessons at The Door, where he has learned English
and is now, after nearly a decade without a formal education,
preparing for the high school equivalency exam. Then, home by 8 to
his room in a basement apartment near Yankee Stadium, so he can
shower, sleep and rise by 3 a.m. for another day at the grill.
</P>
<P>
   He is 21 now, but Francisco's childhood died young, in the
Oaxacan village of Etla. By the time he was 10, he was hopping
trains to faraway towns, where he passed himself off as an orphan
and ran errands in exchange for food, spare change, a set of new
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   His parents tried to wring the restlessness out of him, but
without success. With the help of a friend already living in the
Bronx, he found a smuggler, who for $900 led him across the border
and onto a plane to New York. Francisco thinks he was 15 then.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, he was sweeping the floors of a midtown garment
factory, 10 or 12 hours every day, for $190 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Finding work was always a breeze, though the terms of his
employment were completely illegal. Under state law, school is
mandatory for all those under 17. And youngsters between ages 16
and 18 are barred from working more than 28 hours a week when
school is in session.
</P>
<P>
   Once, cutting a swatch of linen, Francisco accidentally sliced
off a piece of his left index finger. His boss dropped him in front
of a hospital emergency room and left. When Francisco returned to
work, the boss refused to take him back, saying he was too young.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really took advantage of me, huh?'' Francisco says,
chuckling. ``I learned that after I left that job.''
</P>
<P>
   In Francisco's fiercely self-protective world, there is little
time or inclination to play. Fear keeps him on the straight and
narrow. Sometimes, he hangs out with a clutch of young Mexicans who
live in his building, but he will not drink with them, for fear he
will not make it to work on time. There are clubs he could go to,
but he won't, for fear he would be swept up in a drunken brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what also keeps Francisco on his path of self-restraint
are boys like Marcos. The two are strangers, but in a way, they are
mirror images.
</P>
<P>
   When Marcos left Oaxaca at age 12, he, too, was searching for
money and education. Seven years later, he has not known a day of
school, nor has he managed to learn English. He has been a
dishwasher, a pizza deliverer and a prep cook. He has also been to
Rikers Island and back.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos has never really been out of trouble. At first, he was
taunted in his East Harlem neighborhood as a ``mojado,'' a wetback.
Thugs repeatedly jumped him, taking what little money he made.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, another band of thugs came to his rescue. They
called themselves Los Vagos, the vagabonds, and they became his
family. They tattooed a tricolor Virgin on his left arm; they made
sure he was never attacked again.
</P>
<P>
   But trouble continued to trail him. Within months, a knife fight
at a soccer match got him six months in jail. And in December, one
of Los Vagos was shot and killed at a club on 116th Street; Marcos
said he and seven other gang members were charged. He is out on
bail, awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say this is the lost generation,'' says Brother Joel
Magallan, a Jesuit who works for the Catholic Archdiocese of New
York as its liaison to Mexican immigrants. ``I know a lot of
parents who are trying to keep them in Mexico. They don't want
their kids coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   Francisco may have run away at 15, but he never intended to stay
away so long, he said. His goal was to earn enough money to
establish a family business. Last year, he wired home $11,000 in
savings so his father could set up a garment factory. He had read
that clothing was one of Mexico's chief exports. Nowhere had he
read about the hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have big capital,'' he says now. ``You have to
have connections.''
</P>
<P>
   The lessons came too late. The five sewing machines bought with
his savings now collect dust in Etla.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of Francisco and the others are distant echoes of
the flood of teen-age immigrants a century ago. Back then, at the
crest of the last great wave of immigration, Italian boys landed by
themselves at Ellis Island and went to work hawking newspapers or
hauling produce. Girls from Russia came alone to work in garment
factories.
</P>
<P>
   But if their ages and aspirations are in many ways the same,
today's teen-age immigrants are landing on drastically changed
shores.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Foner, an anthropologist who studies the city's
immigration history, offered her own family's example. In 1905 or
so, when her grandfather was 8 or 9, he came alone from Russia and
joined a brother in Hartford. The sum of his American education was
some time in night school as a working teen-ager, but by the time
he retired, he was running a lucrative construction business in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, few immigrants of that era bounded up the economic
ladder in one generation. Still, those with little schooling could
find factory jobs _ often dirty jobs for low pay, but jobs for
life. Some could move from unskilled factory jobs to semiskilled
labor at slightly better pay. Some could even open small shops or
factories. And since, with few exceptions, even those without
formal papers did not face the constant threat of deportation, even
the immigrant who did not succeed economically could establish a
firm, legal foothold for the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much harder to get ahead today, with as little education
as my grandfather had,'' Ms. Foner explains.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Today's teen-age immigrants, by contrast, are unlikely to be
legal and have few ways to change that. Unlike adults with
marketable skills, they are unlikely to be sponsored by an
employer, and few have resident family members to help them obtain
green cards. And their immigration status, compounded by poverty,
makes it extremely difficult to get the higher education that is
ever more crucial to economic success. For illegal immigrants, a
secure job of any kind has become harder to find.
</P>
<P>
   So, while some will find a way to get ahead, most seem likely to
drift from way station to way station in New York's economic
underground, hoping, at best, to save enough money to set up a
decent life back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess would be that if you do not have fluency in English,
if you do not have skills, if you do not have legal papers, you're
going to work in a marginal, shadow economy,'' says David Reimers,
a historian at New York University. ``I don't see these people, in
their lifetime, improving that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether most will end up staying or returning home is anyone's
guess. For now, out there on the margins, they tend to fall below
the radar of government agencies that deal with children. Given the
choices here and at home, some academics and advocates say, it is
probably just as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty sad thing to say that perhaps, the best outcome
would be let them work, leave them alone,'' says Hector
Cordero-Guzman, a sociologist at the New School for Social
Research. ``Increased enforcement might not mean better life
chances for these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   If college is the dream, Jian would seem closer than most. Even
so, he feels it slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   The first in his family to learn his letters, he is 20 credits
shy of a high school diploma. Eight hours a day, he is in class at
Manhattan Comprehensive Night and Day School, a school for older
teen-agers. Four years after leaving China at age 17, his time is
running out. He can attend public school free only until the end of
his 21st year; he has just turned 21.
</P>
<P>
   Weekends are spent behind the Plexiglass of a Chinese takeout
restaurant in New Jersey: 12-hour shifts both days, $70 a day. At
first, his priorities puzzled his roommates. ``They said, `Why you
want to study? You're not born here,' '' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Many young immigrants like him rarely venture outside Chinatown
or learn English, he says. The prospect terrifies him. ``You don't
know English, you know how difficult life is,'' Jian says. ``How
about the future?''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Jian pays $50 a month for a bed in a sixth-floor
walk-up. The apartment is so cramped that Jian does his morning
sit-ups in bed, so noisy that he can start studying at the kitchen
table only after everyone goes to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Jian considers himself an optimist and says he has no regrets
about coming here. And recently, he was granted a rare boon _
political asylum on grounds of religious persecution. He is a
Christian, with the dangerous habit of preaching to his classmates
back home. He can become an American citizen in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with the security of asylum, even with a diploma, he
says he will have to postpone college until he can climb his
mountain of debt: the $40,000 that his parents borrowed from family
and from the bank to have him smuggled to America. So after high
school, Jian plans to get a full-time restaurant job and start
repaying the loans. He does not know anyone who has gone to college
here. He says it probably costs too much. ``I'm not sure,'' he
concludes, ``but I think it's a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Abdoulaye felt that adolescent urge to take flight
from Senegal, nearly every house on his block in Kaolack had sent a
young man abroad _ to France, Italy and, in recent years, to the
United States. At 19, made restless by a long strike at his
university, Abdoulaye joined the odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new generation _ you have to go out and discover,'' his
father had told him before his death. ``To be more lucky than us.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdoulaye knew America long before he got here. He knew the
rhymes of Public Enemy and Tupac Shakur and the names of
fashionable sneakers. He also knew how much money his compatriots
had made here and taken back to Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 20, Abdoulaye is luckier than many of his peers. He
lives with his uncles and their wives in the Bronx. He works at the
family business, selling color televisions to fellow Africans. He
just wasn't prepared for the loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   In a palm-size photo album, he keeps snapshots of his friends
back home. Abdoulaye misses their company terribly. On the subway,
he listens to Youssou N'Dour on his headphones and writes to them,
telling them the truth about this place they all once dreamed of.
Recently, he wrote about attending his first American
demonstration, in front of the house where Amadou Diallo died.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, in my country, every time I walk the street, I was
with one of my friends,'' he says. ``Here, when I get out of
school, I walk by myself. Nobody talks to me. I don't talk to
nobody. I feel, `Where I am? Where I am?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Monir calls home whenever he is blue, which is evidently often,
considering he sometimes runs up a $200 phone bill. Often, the
conversation turns to his future here, though, in typical immigrant
fashion, he is less than candid about the fine points of his new
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really tell them how much I work,'' he confides.

   For a year and a half, he has worked seven hours a night, six
nights a week at the Thai restaurant. At the end of each shift, he
pockets $45.

<P>
   His mother still presses him to come home, but so far, his more
pragmatic parent has prevailed. ``My father says, `What is he going
to do here?' '' Monir explains.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, he asks that same question of himself.

   ``I think a lot about whether to stay,'' he says, ``or whether
to go back.''

SHOWDOWN IN SUBURBIA OVER THE GOOD SIDE AND THE BAD SIDE OF
FENCES

<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a good side and a bad side to everything. Especially
fences.
</P>
<P>
   A new range war has broken out, this time on the suburban
frontier. As in days of old, it concerns fences _ specifically,
wooden stockade fences, which are growing in popularity and lend a
touch of Fort Apache to even the most unremarkable ranch home.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a pretty picture. Which is why, in shades of the tense
confrontation between fence-building homesteaders and cattle
ranchers in the movie ``Shane,'' the town board in Haverstraw,
N.Y., adopted a law last week that bars homeowners from installing
stockade fences so that the spiky unfinished side faces the
neighbors and the pretty, polished side faces the house. Outlaws
have 30 days to comply or face a $250 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very upsetting,'' said Denise Werlitz, a 45-year-old
insurance representative and unlikely villain of the dispute that
has come to roost on her fence, whose ``bad side'' faces out. ``I
feel, if I'm buying it, I should be able to see the nicer side of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Florence Jender, who lives down the block and whose own stockade
fence is placed nice-side-out, sees things differently.
``Aesthetically, it's not correct,'' she said curtly. ``For
niceness, and the property values, it should be the correct way.''
</P>
<P>
   Descendants of the fences that protected colonists against
Indians and marauding animals, stockade fences have been
proliferating in Haverstraw, about 35 miles northwest of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The ``offensive side'' of a stockade fence, as Garret Freeman,
the chief code enforcement officer for the town, calls it,
typically consists of horizontal rails and posts that support the
``good side,'' a series of pointed pickets, rounded mechanically to
mimic tree trunks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the earliest stockade fences, which were a fundamental
element of survival, today's rustic fences are usually bought for
privacy and, in Ms. Werlitz's case, to protect her yard from flying
debris from the road. Solid ``privacy fencing'' is flourishing in
high-density areas where ``people want to be the king of their own
little world,'' said Robert B. Shipley, the owner of Anchor Fence
in Rexford, N.Y. He estimates that 15 percent to 20 percent of his
residential sales are the stockade variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can fully appreciate how it could become an emotional
issue about personal rights,'' said Terry Dempsey, executive vice
president of the American Fence Association in Stone Mountain, Ga.,
which promotes ``fence-scaping'' the landscape and whose members
sell about 72,000 miles of fencing a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one tenet we have in America is that we all strive to be
good neighbors,'' he said. ``You wouldn't show exposed studs on the
outside of your house.''
</P>
<P>
   The showdown in Haverstraw _ which resulted in the new local law
No. 2, an amendment to the zoning code _ came about because of the
increasing number of complaints about the brazen disregard of fence
etiquette, with at least a dozen offenders. Since the 19th century,
the fence has been viewed not only as a boundary but as a public
amenity. ``Just like we do in our families, the idea has been to
put the better face out in public,'' said Philip Dole, a professor
emeritus of architecture at the University of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Installing a stockade fence the wrong way has a certain
historical irony. ``When you turn it around,'' said Shipley, ``you
offer your predator a ladder to get over your fence.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law in Haverstraw, similar to one in West Haverstraw
down the road, stipulates that fence posts be placed on the inside
of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're spite fences, in a sense,'' said Freeman, 56, the code
enforcer, a lifelong Haverstraw resident who cruises the territory
of mostly new, $250,000 to $300,000 Tudors and center-hall
Colonials in a decommissioned police car looking for offending
examples.
</P>
<P>
   His mission echoes the ``fence viewers'' of colonial New
England, who were appointed by towns to survey fences and fine
owners of damaged ones, which threatened the public peace with
unruly cattle. ``Would you want to look at this all the time?'' he
said, stopping at one of several egregious examples. ``It says, `To
hell with you and I don't care.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The number of similar laws appears to be growing, although their
exact number is unrecorded, said Kevin Crawford, the lawyer for the
Association of Towns, which represents 910 communities in the state
of New York. There are regulations on the books in other towns,
including Brecksville, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, and Satellite
Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year in Altamont, N.Y., a suburb of Albany, the
village board passed a similar law prompted by a renegade stockade
fence in a subdivision. Walter Jensen, the Altamont building
inspector, called the reversed stockade fence ``an inconsiderate
act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People today profess to be kinder and gentler, just like
George Bush talked about,'' he added. ``But they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of Bush territory _ Tyler, Texas _ Larry Barbin,
owner of Barbin Fence Inc., a fence contractor, said that 90
percent of his customers for stockade fencing ask for the smooth
side facing them.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Clemens, the director of building and zoning for Clifton
Park, N.Y., also near Albany, where the majority of new homes are
in subdivisions, says privacy fences are ``a growing problem'' for
communities like his, which, unlike Tyler, are considering fencing
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   To some, wrong-way fences, along with unmowed lawns and black
plastic sheeting anchoring a mountain of leaves, are part of what
John R. Stilgoe, a professor of landscape history at the Harvard
Graduate School of Design, called ``a collapsing code of visual
neighborliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Danielsen, director of residential policy for the Urban
Land Institute, a real estate research organization based in
Washington, said that there was a growing trend in middle-class
communities toward ``increasingly trying to exercise control over
their neighbors'' through formal ordinances more commonly
associated with master-planned and gated communities.
</P>
<P>
   Longer working hours, mobility and smaller families have
contributed to neighbors not knowing one another, she said. ``In
the past, they might have had a social relationship,'' she said.
``But today it's become difficult for people to face neighbors to
say something doesn't look pleasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Salkin, director of the Government Law Center at the
Albany Law School, says that for every person who erects a fence
for their children's safety, there is another ``going from the
garage to work, from work to the garage, barricading themselves
against the neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, the code enforcer, said he remembered the Haverstraw of
his youth, when lawns were vast expanses of greenery with no
fences, ``like one big backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   He also misses the days before people looked to code enforcers
to mediate squabbles. ``The kids solve their own problems, and the
parents hold grudges,'' he said. ``I tell them, `I'm not a
counseling agent. You've got to talk to each other.' ''

COMMENTARY: BUSH VS. BLACKMUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both considered themselves moderate Republicans and both were
faced with the tough issue of abortion. One made a stand on
principle and will be remembered as a man of courage and integrity.
The other has carefully gauged the direction of the wind, and may
well end up as president.
</P>
<P>
   The early 1970s was still a treacherous time for women or girls
who wanted to terminate a pregnancy. Thousands of women,
particularly those who were well educated and well off financially,
were able to get legal abortions through physicians willing to
engage in some charade, like claiming the mother's life was in
danger. Some wealthy women could get illegal abortions that were
reasonably safe, or go overseas for abortions. But the vast
majority of women and girls who wanted an abortion had no
alternative but to roll the dice on a criminal procedure that might
be performed in some wretched undercover location by some inept
practitioner using unsanitary and often unscientific methods.
</P>
<P>
   Many thousands died.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew how Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, a Nixon
appointee, would approach the issue of a woman's right to an
abortion when Roe vs. Wade came before the Supreme Court. Blackmun
was a quiet, modest Midwesterner, a lifelong Republican and close
friend of the conservative chief justice, Warren Burger. He was
selected for the court largely because he was perceived as a
hard-liner on crime. He was an unlikely candidate to be the author
and decades-long champion of a decision that was as controversial
and guaranteed such radical consequences as Roe.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times' Linda Greenhouse, in Blackmun's obituary
March 5, wrote: ``The care with which Justice Blackmun approached
the issue was evident from the opening passage of his opinion, in
which he acknowledged `the deep and seemingly absolute convictions
that the subject inspires.'''
</P>
<P>
   The vote on Roe was 7-2, but Blackmun, as the author, was most
closely identified with the ruling. He was both revered and
vilified as a result. But no amount of obloquy could make him doubt
the correctness or the value of the decision. When he retired in
1994 he described the ruling as a step that had to be taken
``toward the full emancipation of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to George W. Bush. The last thing he wants to do as
he gallops toward the presidency is to take a clear and unequivocal
principled stand on abortion. If he were to favor a woman's right
to choose, he would be ambushed from the right. And if he were to
absolutely follow what he says is in his heart and in his mind _
that we should amend the Constitution and ban abortion outright _
the boulders would immediately begin falling on him from the left.
</P>
<P>
   Poor George. There is nothing left to do but equivocate.
</P>
<P>
   So, in an interview with The Associated Press last week, the
Texas governor and leading contender for the Republican
presidential nomination, said he would support a constitutional
amendment to outlaw abortions, except in cases of rape or incest,
or where the life of the woman was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' he said, ``I'm a realistic enough person
to know that America is not ready to ban abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bush, ``America is not ready to overturn Roe vs.
Wade because America's hearts are not right. And so, in the
meantime, instead of arguing over Roe vs. Wade, what we ought to do
is promote policies to reduce abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Got that? If you don't want to overturn Roe vs. Wade, your
heart's not right. Maybe under the guidance and leadership of
President Bush II, your heart will get right. And with our hearts
right, and a couple of new Clarence Thomases on the Supreme Court,
all things are possible. America can finally get rid of Roe, put
women back in their place and return to the glorious years of
back-alley abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, said of Blackmun: ``He had an
ability to take the law out of the abstract and understand its
effect on the lives of real people. His primary motivation was to
see that the law was fair and that it provided dignity for the
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's primary motivation is to get to the White
House. The last thing he wants to do is stumble upon a principle.

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The Christmas card list of Don and Jean Carol
Zimmer holds steady at about 300 and requires more than a month to
satisfy, for there has always been news to report in their 51 years
in baseball, and she can't help but write long notes.
</P>
<P>
   New friends are made each season. Others are lost in time. Merry
Christmas to Casey Stengel and Ted Williams; have a great New Year
to Jackie Robinson and Derek Jeter; happy holidays, Yogi Berra.
Season's greetings go out to the landlady who kept their boarding
room in 1951, and to George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner.
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer seems to have known everyone and seen everything in
his half century in the game as a player, coach and manager, and
now, at 68, he is filling in for his close friend Joe Torre, the
Yankees' manager, who learned last week that he had prostate
cancer. No one knows whether it will be for three weeks or three
months, and Zimmer's mission is to maintain the culture Torre has
created.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer has always seized opportunity as a manager and as a
person; carpe diem. As the Yankees' bench coach, he spoke to Torre
in low tones during games, offering advice, and found that Torre
and he almost always agreed. Now he will speak to Torre before
games and follow his own instincts in crucial innings, knowing
Torre would probably take the same course of action.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer was there as a young infielder when the Brooklyn Dodgers
finally beat the Yankees in the World Series, in 1955. He played
with the 1962 Mets, arguably the worst team ever, and was a bench
coach for the 1998 Yankees, perhaps the best team ever.
</P>
<P>
   He played in Cuba before Castro, and with the Washington
Senators after Kennedy. When Carlton Fisk hit his home run to end
Game 6 of the 1975 World Series _ history's fall classic _ Zimmer
followed Fisk to home plate from the third-base coach's box,
jumping and hollering joyfully. When the Yankees finally beat
Boston in a one-game playoff to end the grueling 1978 pennant race,
Zimmer was managing the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer briefly retired before the 1996 season and received a
single Social Security check of about $1,000 _ the only money he
has made outside of baseball. ``I've lived a full life, I'll tell
you that,'' Zimmer said as he sat in the dugout here Friday,
staring forward, his arms rested on a baseball bat, Svengali in a
Yankees cap. ``How can a man have any better?''
</P>
<P>
   He is instantly recognizable to baseball fans and players:
Zimmer is thickly built, short and strong, with a round head and
prominent cheeks and small eyes that appear perfectly circular,
like dimes. When Zimmer is angry, his eyelids peel back and the
white around his eyes is revealed, and you know somebody is in deep
trouble; an umpire suggested Zimmer wasn't telling the truth a
couple of years ago, and, oh boy, the eyelids disappeared
completely.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimmer's eyes are soft when he is with friends and trading
barbs. If he has a Charlie Brown head, then he has Snoopy's love of
life: Happiness is playing baseball with friends. He can tell many,
many stories. Joe Girardi, the catcher who has been with Zimmer on
three different teams, including the Yankees, said players look
forward to rain delays, when someone might ask Zimmer about Willie
Mays, or maybe Joe DiMaggio or Casey falling asleep in the dugout,
or breaking curfew or the day the Cubs fired him. Zimmer spills
over with anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Zim would change anything in his life,'' Girardi
said. ``He likes to have fun. He enjoys every minute on the field.
When he sees people who aren't enjoying it, he doesn't
understand.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer was already a major-league manager when Jeter was born,
and the hair that remains on his head is gray, but he mixes easily
with the players; he is fun to be around, and there is no
generation gap.
</P>
<P>
   He and third baseman Scott Brosius are bridge partners in a
season-long game against Girardi and outfielder Paul O'Neill.
Zimmer sits upright in a chair, his feet crossed underneath him,
glasses at the end of his nose, expressionless. Brosius finds
himself desperately trying to understand Zimmer's strategy, his
aggressive play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's intimidating as a partner _ I don't know what I'm doing
anyway, and I'm afraid I'm going to screw up the hand,'' said
Brosius, who teased Zimmer that his batting average probably was
200 points lower after they played because he was so mentally
drained.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to play, he likes to win; he shows emotion out
there,'' O'Neill said. ``He shows emotion in a card game. I like
that in him; I like Joe the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   All the details of Zimmer's lifetime are contained in the
scrapbooks his wife has kept since they were teen-agers, 65
scrapbooks in all. Born and raised in Cincinnati, Zimmer's idol as
a teen-ager was Pee Wee Reese, the star shortstop for the Brooklyn
Dodgers. He signed with the Dodgers and was a shortstop like Reese,
devoted to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He and Carol Jean Bauerle, his high school sweetheart commonly
known to everyone by her nickname Soot, married on the field before
a minor-league game in Elmira, N.Y., in 1951; once the ceremony
ended, Zimmer changed from his suit into his baseball uniform and
played, Soot and family and friends watching from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Hitters didn't bother with helmets when Zimmer began playing,
and he suffered a terrible beaning in 1953, going into a two-week
coma. To relieve swelling on his brain, doctors drilled holes in
his skull _ indentations that can still be seen. (Zimmer legend has
it that he has a metal plate in his head and sets off alarms at
security checkpoints in airports. Not so, said Mrs. Zimmer, adding
that the conventional wisdom is so prevalent that he doesn't bother
correcting it.)
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer learned how to walk and talk and play baseball again,
however, and broke into the majors the next year with the Brooklyn
Dodgers, with Reese guiding him. They remain the best of friends,
and Zimmer was supposed to see him last Wednesday, the day Torre
disclosed his illness to the entire team.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer bounced from Brooklyn to Los Angeles to the Chicago Cubs,
to the Mets and Cincinnati and Washington, playing 12 years in all.
He began managing in the minors in 1967, and in 1972 he took over
the San Diego Padres, in the first of his 13 years as a
major-league manager.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer managed the Red Sox from 1976-80, and in 1978, Boston won
99 games but surrendered a 14-game lead over the Yankees before
losing the one-game playoff on Bucky Dent's three-run homer. Zimmer
speaks of that season with relish, of the joy of going to the park
with so much on the line every day.
</P>
<P>
   He is still booed in Fenway Park for the outcome of that season,
many Red Sox faithful forever maintaining that Zimmer should've
rested his regulars more, should've trusted the maverick
left-hander Bill Lee _ the David Wells of his time _ in a crucial
game against the Yankees. But Zimmer apparently took the booing as
a natural extension of his job. When his grown daughter tearfully
told him that she hated to hear him berated, Zimmer suggested she
stop coming to the park.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer recalled how in 1981, the first year after the Red Sox
fired him and he was hired to manage the Texas Rangers, his team
opened the season in Boston. As Zimmer strolled to home plate to
exchange lineup cards with the new Red Sox manager, Ralph Houk, a
hurricane of boos followed, louder and louder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is a bad baseball town,'' Zimmer told the home plate
umpire, acting deadly serious. ``Can you believe how they're
treating a respected manager like Ralph Houk?''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer managed the Chicago Cubs until from 1988-91, coached from
1992-95 and then quit the game, intent on spending more time with
his grandchildren. After Steinbrenner hired Torre following the
1995 season, Torre asked Zimmer to coach for him, though the two
men knew each other only professionally, from opposing dugouts.
Once Zimmer and Torre agreed that Zimmer would always be encouraged
to offer opinions, Zimmer agreed to come out of retirement, and
after two weeks with Torre he told his wife that he had made the
right decision, that they would work great together.
</P>
<P>
   Neither realized they would become such good friends, sharing
mornings at a race track, playing golf and eating dinner, always on
the move; Torre once said that the best way to get a young player
in physical condition was to have him follow Zimmer around all day.
Torre constantly called Zimmer in the off-season, playfully
badgering him five times in one week from Maui in December, like
high school pals.
</P>
<P>
   Torre asked Zimmer early last week to take over in his absence.
Zimmer agreed, but he said he wouldn't use Torre's office, or ride
in his seat on the team bus or plane. Those will be left for his
friend. Zimmer nearly broke down Thursday when asked about his
feelings for Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends, that's what baseball has been about,'' said Zimmer,
the man whose name is on 300 Christmas cards every year. Best
wishes, Joe Torre.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An important winter storm will begin to strengthen over the
southeastern states on Sunday, causing an area of snow, sleet and
rain to spread from the Ohio Valley into the Middle Atlantic
States. A wintry mixture will gradually taper off during the
morning and midday near the Ohio River as low pressure over
Tennessee transfers energy to a storm center in the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wet snow and sleet will increase in intensity from
the mountains of Virginia and West Virginia to southern
Pennsylvania. Mainly rain will fall near the middle Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, clouds will increase from the northern
Appalachians to the New England coast. Snow will develop across
these areas late on Sunday and Sunday night as winds from the east
increase. The precipitation may mix with sleet and rain near the
coast by early Monday, but heavy snow accumulations are expected in
the interior.
</P>
<P>
   A band of strong thunderstorms will precede a cold front as it
moves across the eastern Carolinas and Florida. Onshore winds will
become gusty near the Carolina coast during the afternoon and
evening. In the wake of the front, breezes from the northwest will
deliver cooler and drier air. A few showers will linger over the
Tennessee and southern Mississippi valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Dry and tranquil conditions will cover a large area from the
Plains into the Rocky Mountains. Meanwhile, a period of rain and
mountain snow will accompany a cold front in northern California.
Farther north, light showers will dissipate as drier air reaches
the northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: March Storms
</P>
<P>
   In much of the East, March storms can be the fiercest of the
winter season. Unlike midwinter tempests, March storms can draw on
the burgeoning warmth and moisture that gathers in the southern
states as spring approaches. Strong thunderstorms often result from
the clash of the sultry air with the remnant chill of winter. Snow
can be particularly heavy where the moisture-laden air is forced to
rise over cold air near the ground. The heat that is released when
the abundant moisture condenses into clouds and precipitation adds
further fuel to the storms, giving rise to widespread high winds.

EUROPE'S TIE TO TURKEY TURNS CHILLIER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Relations between Turkey and the European
Union, which have been cool since the union left Turkey off a list
of prospective members more than a year ago, have now turned
frigid.
</P>
<P>
   The principal reason for the change, according to diplomats in
the Turkish capital, is the emotional debate that has erupted over
the imprisoned Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   After Ocalan was forced out of his hideout in Syria in October,
he spent nearly three months in Europe, most of it in Italy. Later
he was caught while living under the protection of Greek diplomats
in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders are outraged by Europe's willingness to harbor
Ocalan and by the refusal of the European Union to denounce him as
a terrorist, as Turkey and the United States have done.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, they have rejected warnings from the European
Union that they must give Ocalan a fair trial, saying they are
capable of doing so without being told. Turkey also has rejected
requests by the union and other foreign organizations to send
observers to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We of course abhor any attempts, no matter from what circles,
to interfere, to intervene in Turkey's internal affairs,'' Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit said at a recent news conference. ``We
couldn't accept it, and we couldn't discuss political matters with
the EU so long as our application for full membership, or at least
our candidacy, is not accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sharply worded statement, the Turkish Foreign Ministry
accused the European Union of hypocrisy for seeking to protect
Ocalan's human rights while failing to condemn Greece for harboring
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not possible to reconcile the silence of the EU about
this criminal collaboration with the principle of rule of law that
it advocates,'' the statement said. ``What is expected from the EU,
above everything, is that it should ask its member which has
shamefully violated international law to account for its behavior.
The credibility of the EU will remain seriously damaged unless it
acts in this way.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, diplomats from the European Union say they are
frustrated by Turkey's refusal to discuss matters that could lead
to an improvement in relations. They say that because Greece is a
member of the union, it is unrealistic for Turkey to expect the
union to issue an explicit condemnation of its actions.
</P>
<P>
   By rejecting political dialogue with the union, those diplomats
say, Turkey is pulling itself away from Europe. Some suspect that
is precisely what Ecevit, who has long been suspicious of Europe's
intentions toward Turkey, wants, and also what anti-Turkish
politicians in Europe want.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Turks say they are willing to talk to us about technical
matters like financing and development projects, but not about
political matters,'' said an ambassador from a European country.
``That doesn't work for us. When we talk to a country, we want to
discuss the full range of our concerns, which in the case of Turkey
means democracy, human rights, the Kurdish issue and, at this
point, the Ocalan trial. Since they refuse to do that, the dialogue
is practically frozen.''
</P>
<P>
   A new representative from Europe, Karen Fogg, took up her post
here in July and has been frustrated by this confrontation. She
previously held a similar post in Romania, which she said was
consumed with a pro-European fervor that sharply contrasts with
what she has found in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the Ocalan affair blew up, there was the possibility for
a slow rebuilding of the relationship, a chance for both sides to
develop some credibility and confidence,'' Ms. Fogg said in an
interview. ``But even for some time before that, we had been seeing
an unbelievable lack of interest. Everything is in a state of
suspended animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a kind of a circular pattern, with each side waiting
for the other to make the first move. They say, `What we need is
some encouragement, some sign that you're taking us seriously as a
candidate.' We say, `Can you show us one centimeter of progress and
stop being rude and act as if you want to be accepted?'
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find so sad here is the lack of enthusiasm,'' she
continued. ``It's quite different from what you see in Eastern
Europe, where people are focused entirely on getting into the EU
and are working on a hundred different fronts to do what they have
to do to get in.''

NEW STATUS FOR BERLIN, EVERYWHERE BUT THE AIR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ga.)   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Early this year, Mayor Eberhard Diepgen of Berlin
slipped off to Chicago to try to resolve an increasingly desperate
problem: the city presenting itself as ``the new capital of
Europe'' does not have a direct flight to or from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin has history, intense and tormented. It has bracing air.
It has a certain raw beauty that has something to do with the
fascination of fracture. It is about to become home, once again, to
the German government.
</P>
<P>
   But can the new capital of Europe's most powerful state be taken
seriously when its only direct intercontinental flights are weekly
services to Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia and Havana?
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation has become extremely embarrassing for the image
of Berlin,'' said Volker Hassemer, the chief executive of Berlin
Partner, a company trying to promote business in this city. ``But
these days the German airline, Lufthansa, only thinks in terms of
profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Communist in its eastern half for more than 40 years and almost
completely subsidized in its island-like western half, Berlin
remains a city where the whiff of money-making is scarcely
overpowering. Lufthansa is unconvinced that it can turn a profit
flying to New York from Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Hence Diepgen's mission to Chicago, where he met in January with
Rono Dutta, the senior vice president for planning at United
Airlines. The mayor's inquiry was: would United fly to the new
German capital from Chicago or New York or anywhere in the United
States?
</P>
<P>
   Diepgen, a Christian Democrat, came away convinced he had put
Berlin on the map. In a statement from his office, he said the
question was not if United would start direct flights to Berlin but
when.
</P>
<P>
   Michael-Andreas Butz, the mayor's spokesman, said, ``With all
the diplomats and federal government and parliamentary people about
to come to Berlin, United is looking at a start-up in the spring of
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   But United Airlines, which already has direct services to
Frankfurt, Munich and Duesseldorf, appears to have taken a rather
different view. Berlin, said Andrew Plews, a spokesman, remains ``a
maybe, and a rather long-term maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's problem is its history. Before Hitler started the war
that brought the city down around him, and before Yalta isolated it
in a divided Europe, many of the biggest German industries were
here. But the major insurance companies and big banks and
industrial groups like Siemens all moved to Munich, Hamburg,
Dusseldorf and elsewhere _ and very few of them show sign of coming
back.
</P>
<P>
   It is a paradox of the transfer of the German capital from Bonn
to Berlin that business is thriving in Bonn _ office space vacancy
is running at just 1.5 percent _ while it is still largely stagnant
in the relatively isolated city of Berlin, where 18 percent of
office space is vacant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin was a kept person for 50 years,'' said Bernhard
Schlink, the novelist, who is a longtime resident. ``The people who
came here were those who wanted to avoid the draft or the laws of
economic competition. And now we find it is hard to live on our own
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Where there is not a lot of business, there are not a lot of
business-class passengers. That is why Delta Air Lines made the
apparently curious decision to close down the one nonstop flight
from Berlin to New York last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just did not make financial sense,'' said Horst Zsifkovits,
the manager of the Delta office in Berlin. ``The problem is not the
quantity of travelers, it's the fact that your business-class cabin
is often empty. Delta is not interested in money-losing
propositions.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, it seems, is Lufthansa, which started a nonstop service
from New York to Berlin with great fanfare in 1990, but quickly
shut it down when it realized ``that the city really had gone to
sleep in economic terms over those many years with the wall,'' said
Wolfgang Weber, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Lufthansa appears to have little interest in draining passengers
from its important hubs in Frankfurt and Munich. Moreover, because
Berlin was long divided, it has three airports _ Tegel, Tempelhof
and Schoenefeld _ which would make it difficult to have a hub for
connecting flights to Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Butz, the mayor's spokesman, said the city planned to spend
about $3.3 billion to turn Schoenefeld, the airport for the former
East Berlin, into ``one of the most modern airports in the world by
2007.'' But airlines are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   So Berlin seems set to continue in its odd limbo. But then the
city's strangeness is perhaps part of its appeal. It is not, after
all, every European capital that offers nonstop service to
Mongolia.

A ROAD-KILL PROPOSAL LEAVES A FUNNY TASTE
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Tenn.)  (nk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ If only the bill had contained the word
``deer,'' then perhaps the possum jokes could have been stopped
flat. If the bill had just made it clear that someone who hits a
deer on the highway can take home the carcass and eat it, then
maybe Tennessee would have been spared all the raccoon cookbooks,
the dead-skunk songs, the bumper stickers, the sniggering
headlines, the laughter that has lighted up the Legislature for the
last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But no. With an unerring genius for the kind of thing that makes
many Tennesseans squirm, the author of the bill decided to phrase
it this way: ``Wild animals accidentally killed by a motor vehicle
may be possessed by any person for personal use and consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it would be legal to eat road kill. Legal to eat
the thousands of squirrels, opossums, raccoons and rabbits that
meet a painfully horizontal death every year beneath rubber tires.
As if a state law were preventing anyone from scraping a Happy Meal
off the asphalt. As if anyone would even dream of it.
</P>
<P>
   From the clamor of the reaction, it seemed as if the state
government had ordered a reversion to Tennessee's mountain-man
roots, closing the groceries and forcing residents to hunt for
their supper. ``Grease the skillet, Ma! New bill will make road
kill legal eatin','' read a headline in The Knoxville News-Sentinel
last month. ``Better fetch ol' Granny's recipe for possum stew,''
said an article in The Commercial Appeal of Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Radio show hosts had a field day. Tim Burchett, the
notoriety-loving state Senator who proposed the law, was inundated
with comic cookbooks and tips on bringing out the best flavor from
a 'coon stew. One of the bumper stickers he received read, ``Cat _
The Other White Meat.'' (Actually, cats and dogs were exempted from
the bill.)
</P>
<P>
   Legislators and lobbyists were unending in their gibes,
prompting him to holler at a dinner party: ``One of these dishes
was made with road kill. And I'm not going to tell you which one!''
The host was not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, there is a legitimate-sounding premise to the
legislation, though it immediately became known as the road-kill
bill. Burchett, a Republican who represents the Knoxville area, was
recently contacted by a constituent who was fined after he
accidentally hit a deer and then gave the meat to a migrant family.
The law currently requires that such accidents be reported
immediately to the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, which must
tag the animal before it can be consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Such accidents happen with increasing frequency in Tennessee,
where the deer herd has multiplied more than 200-fold over the last
50 years to its current record size of nearly 1 million. The
wildlife agency estimates that there are 10,000 collisions every
year between vehicles and deer, and without enough wildlife
officers to tag each deer and citizens forbidden to eat a carcass
until it is tagged, Burchett believes the tagging requirement is an
infringement upon personal liberty. Not to mention a waste of
perfectly good venison, which, he adds soulfully, could be donated
to the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, because it's Tennessee, everyone's going to make us
look like a bunch of hayseed rednecks, and I understand that, and I
know the media's getting a big kick out of this,'' Burchett said.
``But after all, the government's supposed to help people with
their problems, and this is just a common-sense thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Burchett said he wrote ``wild animals'' into the bill instead of
deer in case the state regulates other big-game animals around
Tennessee, a move that seems unlikely. But the senator, not
uncomfortable with publicity, acknowledges a certain taste for
legislation that many have considered off the wall. He has, over
the years, proposed bills to require the castration of both child
molesters and stray animals, to repeal the law requiring
motorcyclists to wear helmets, and to require driver's license
applicants to pay for their own interpreters if they do not speak
English. All have received considerable attention, as well as a few
clucks from sober-minded editorialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``In four years, people aren't going to remember road kill,
they'll just remember Burchett,'' the senator said, adding that he
plans to distribute cans of (fake) possum meat to his colleagues
when the bill reaches the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal certainly drew the attention of the wildlife
agency, which raised concerns that some motorists would
deliberately try to ``bumper-hunt'' deer by running them over and
claiming it was an accident. Burchett played down such fears, but
agreed to add an amendment that allows consumption of road kill as
long as the driver notifies the local police within 48 hours. The
agency, satisfied that it could keep track of the deer population
this way, signed off on the bill, which is now expected to be
approved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tennessee, like so many other states, is often torn between
pride and embarrassment at certain aspects of its heritage, and
intentionally or not, the road-kill bill only heightened that
ambivalence. Many legislators won't even discuss the bill any
longer, rolling their eyes and trying to change the subject to more
pressing legislation, such as the plan to revamp the state-funded
health care program, or Gov. Don Sundquist's proposal to replace
some sales taxes with a business tax.
</P>
<P>
   But as noted by state Rep. Tommy Head, who is sponsoring the
road-kill bill in the House, there is a reason that the Speaker of
the House, Jimmy Naifeh, sponsors a 'coon supper every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of rural people in this state who understand
what this is about,'' said Head, from Clarksville. ``Personally, I
don't care for 'coon. I don't like the taste of 'coon. But we've
got a lot of people at home who have 'coon dogs and hunt for 'coon.
Of course, not with their cars.''

TO REVIVE A SICK ECONOMY, JAPAN HANDS OUT COUPONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ With all the strength of her 90 years, Chizuko Miyata
clutched her crisp, cream-colored coupons and began dreaming of
what she would buy with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so interested in fashion these days,'' said Mrs.
Miyata, a twinkle in her eye. ``So I'm going to use them to buy the
things I need in everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim of these coupons is to boost buying,'' added Mrs.
Miyata, who had just picked up the new coupons that the government
is handing out to spur consumption and revive the economy. ``I
understand that aim. So I'm going to spend more.''
</P>
<P>
   If all Japanese citizens were that loyal, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi would have nothing to worry about. But nobody knows whether
the scheme _ one of the oddest ideas ever tried to revive a major
economy _ will succeed in getting people to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy is stuck in its worst recession since the end of
World War II, even if there are some signs of progress, and one of
the problems has been that ordinary citizens are so anxious about
the future that they are saving their yen rather than spending it.
The government has tried tax cuts, but people tend to save them as
well.
</P>
<P>
   So Obuchi and his Cabinet are handing out something that people
cannot save. It is distributing nearly $6 billion worth of shopping
coupons, and since they expire in August people have no choice but
to use them in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very big experiment,'' said Katsuyuki Hikasa, a
senior policymaking official in the Komei Party, which originally
proposed the idea to the governing Liberal Democratic Party. ``This
is the first such economic experiment done anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, economists have attacked the plan on many fronts, and few
believe it will be very successful. For starters, some say that
since money is fungible, consumers will spend the coupons and save
an equivalent amount of cash.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plan has been a logistical nightmare, and it is
proving expensive to administer. The government has also attached
strings to the coupons so that residents normally must use their
coupons in their own neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   To boost local business, the government had each town and
municipality find its own printers, dye specialists and paper
makers to mint their form of local currency. So some coupons are
pink, some are blue, some are white, some are cream.
</P>
<P>
   The localities can also set their own rules, within guidelines.
So some coupons can be spent at brothels and nightclubs or gambling
at pachinko parlors and mahjong tables. Others can be used only for
purposes that the authorities deem appropriate, such as shops and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, authorities have tried to help small businesses
by forcing residents to wait 40 days before they can use their
coupons at big department stores, while others have color-coded
coupons that restrict them to spending half at the big stores to
ensure that at least the other half is spent at small stores.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is whether the coupons will encourage people to
spend more. And the risk is that there are plenty of people out
there like Emiko Kawamura.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kawamura, 41, sees the coupons as a form of financial
relief that allows her to expand her rainy day nest egg. With three
kids, including a 16-year-old who does not qualify for the coupon,
Mrs. Kawamura is pinching pennies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to buy anything expensive or big,'' said Mrs.
Kawamura. ``With the coupons to spend, I have extra money. So I
don't have to take so much out from my bank account this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Keiko Komine, a lively homemaker with two boys, is more like the
kind of person the government is hoping for. Mrs. Komine plans to
plunk her $340 worth in coupons into a new bookshelf for her
6-year-old son who is about to start first grade. Her children
recently learned how to ski and so she also has plans to squeeze in
a short vacation on the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking of saving because we have to buy a lot of
things this season,'' said Mrs. Komine. ``I'm hoping to spend the
extra money on skiing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The biggest complaint comes from the large swath of Japanese
people who do not get the coupons. In general, the coupons go to
families with children under 15 or senior citizens over 65, and the
amount handed out varies with the number of people in each
category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there should be other ways of doing this,'' said Chie
Takeguchi, a 36-year-old mother who tagged her baby girl along as
she picked up her $165 worth of $8 coupons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who get the coupons and others who do
not get them. Originally, the idea was that everyone would get
something. But they changed that, and I have some reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Takeguchi's parents are younger than the 65-year-old age
limit to receive the coupons, and she said: ``They have expressed
the idea that they do not think the program is entirely fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Fumiko Okazawa, who is 72, expressed puzzlement that she can
receive the coupons but that her husband, who is 80, cannot. For
elderly recipients, the government screens out people who earn too
much money, and he was excluded for that reason. Her husband, she
said, was a bit envious and a bit contemptuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just tells me that I can receive these coupons because my
income is so low,'' she explained.

SEPARATISTS IN SPAIN RAGE OVER ARRESTS OF 17 BASQUES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID _ The arrest last week of the suspected military chief of
the Basque separatist group ETA, while the guerrillas were
observing a unilateral cease-fire, has provoked a storm of
criticism that the government might be squandering a chance to
negotiate an end to 30 years of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Basque nationalist politicians have called the arrests of 17
suspected guerrillas in France and Spain since Tuesday
``provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of a week that also included some protests and
scattered violence, the peace effort was stalled. No one was
willing to pronounce it dead, however, and few predicted that the
rebels immediately would resume a campaign of shootings or
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The government responded to the criticism by saying that the
weakened guerrillas might now have even more reason to embrace
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our commitment to peace is permanent,'' said Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar. ``We have to work at it every day. I wish they
would do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a pro-independence Basque youth organization called
Jarrai urged its members to participate in a ``day of struggle''
that resulted in scattered firebombings and smashed windows. Five
people were injured, five others were arrested in various
disturbances and a Basque town councilwoman from the governing
conservative Popular Party received a package bomb which the police
defused.
</P>
<P>
   The round of arrests was the first crackdown since the ETA began
its cease-fire last September. The rebel leadership, which has made
its views known through communiques sent at night to Basque media,
was noticeably silent after the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Some terrorism experts say that ETA forces could be at very
reduced numbers. ETA, whose initials in Basque stand for Basque
Homeland and Liberty, is believed responsible for about 800 deaths
since 1968. The group is fighting for the independence of the
northern Basque region, home to 2.1 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The interior ministers of Spain and France met in Paris earlier
this month to analyze the rebels' rear guard in France.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of the suspected military leader, Jose Javier
Arizcuren, 40, came on Tuesday, four days after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He was apprehended in Paris just as the Spanish prime minister
arrived for a visit with French President Jacques Chirac and Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin. Aznar thanked them for ``very fruitful
cooperation'' against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Arizcuren is wanted for 10 killings and also for involvement in
a failed assassination plot in 1995 against Spain's king, Juan
Carlos, the Spanish authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Another suspect detained in Paris was Irantzu Gallestegui, 26.
She is wanted in the 1997 killing of Miguel Angel Blanco, a
conservative Basque town councilman. His death prompted about six
million Spaniards to march against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   As the arrests mounted and the police seized a home in southern
France containing more than 660 pounds of materials to make
explosives, the authorities said the rebels appeared to be making
preparations for possible attacks.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no known direct contacts during the cease-fire
between the government and ETA.
</P>
<P>
   The government maintains that the rebels must renounce violence
before peace talks can begin. But even then, a senior government
official said, there are sharp differences over what to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   The government, he said, wants to limit talks to rebel
disarmament and the fate of 461 rebels in Spanish jails and others
in exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have any political negotiations with ETA,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But the rebels have
said talks would have to include the issue of Basque sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   With such a chasm, Sagrario Moran, a Madrid professor who wrote
a book about the ETA conflict, does not expect any talks until
after the general elections scheduled for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peace process is being used by all the political parties
as a tool, to get votes,'' Ms. Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   The leftist Euskal Herritarrok coalition, which is considered
close to the rebels, surged in Basque regional elections last
October after the cease-fire began, and for the first time became a
real power in the Basque Parliament. The Parliament, which was
established in 1980, is dominated by the moderate Basque
Nationalist Party, which favors independence if achieved
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Next June, the nationalists will battle the Madrid-based Popular
Party and the Socialists for town hall seats in the Basque region.
Along with its own Parliament, the region has taxing power and a
6,000-member police force.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Nearly 25 years ago Jacqueline Johnson boarded a school
bus every school day to travel from her black neighborhood,
Roxbury, to a predominantly white school in another part of the
city, Jamaica Plain.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with three children of her own in Boston public schools
she eagerly hopes the city will end busing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have my child able to walk to school,'' Ms.
Johnson said. ``I think it's important that you have that sense of
community. I'd have more involvement in the school if it's close to
home.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ruth Batson was younger, but no less feisty, she was among
those black parents whose lawsuit resulted in extensive busing of
students. Today when she hears talk about the need to end busing in
favor of improved neighborhood schools, she shakes her head,
wondering if the city is giving up on integration and returning to
a time when black students were short-changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that hurts me the most is so many black people are
saying, `We don't have segregated schools any more. Let's move on.
Let's move on,''' Ms. Batson said.
</P>
<P>
   Race and public schools weigh heavily on Bostonians these days
as the city moves warily away from desegregation efforts that began
explosively in 1974 with a federal court order. Like many other
cities, Boston over the last 25 years has struggled to maintain
some measure of integration by sprinkling the dwindling number of
whites, who make up less than 20 percent of the students, around
the system.
</P>
<P>
   But in January, Mayor Thomas M. Menino announced a new effort to
build more schools in minority neighborhoods over the next six
years as part of a plan to allow more students to attend school
nearer their homes and thus reduce the need for busing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is a much different city today than it was then,''
Menino said in an interview, referring to the pre-busing era.
``It's a much more integrated city; more people of color in every
neighborhood. So this is the time in our history when we've got to
make a decision to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   With Boston's 64,000 students performing poorly on standardized
tests and truancy rates there among the highest in the country,
school officials say the priority must be improving the system,
rather than integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``My issue is focusing on how to improve education for all
children in this city and not be distracted or have a lot of energy
and resources going into debates around student assignment,'' said
Thomas W. Payzant, the school superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts are not unique. Similar sentiments are growing
among black and white parents in a number of places, like Prince
Georges County, Md., where blacks constitute a majority of the
public school students.
</P>
<P>
   But such actions are particularly poignant in Boston, where in
response to Judge W. Arthur Garrity's 1974 order to integrate
schools, whites attacked school buses full of black children and
roughed up black bystanders. The trouble led some to label Boston
``the Little Rock of the North.''
</P>
<P>
   As the city inches back toward neighborhood schools, some now
worry that simmering racial antagonism will burst forth again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine came to work for the Boston public schools
two years ago from Milwaukee,'' said James W. Fraser, director of
the Center for Innovation in Urban Education at Northeastern
University here.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of her comments to me a short while after she started
working was that, `As soon as I start tapping the surface, it's
like desegregation happened yesterday. The issues, and the hurts
and the wounds and the feelings about it, are still so fresh.'''
</P>
<P>
   Boston is also an example of the continuing debate among blacks
over education strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Is it better to keep pressing for integration in the face of
schools that do not seem to improve, continued white resistance and
what some view as an increasingly hostile federal judiciary? Or is
it better to accept a possible resegregation of the system and
concentrate on improving schools in black neighborhoods?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not just change the inner-city schools, rather than just
bus our kids?'' Ms. Johnson asked. ``It doesn't make too much sense
to me for my kid to go way across town when they could upgrade the
schools for the children in inner-city areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, a federal appeals court ruled that the city had
complied with desegregation. Two years later, heeding Garrity's
order that they not lapse back into segregation, Boston school
officials allowed parents to choose any school within three large
zones in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a parent received their first choice depended on whether
the child's presence at that school would upset its racial balance
as determined by the demographics of that zone.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents say that the policy, known as ``controlled
choice,'' leads to a mad scramble for the available slots in the
better schools. Elementary schools like the Beethoven School in the
predominantly white neighborhood of West Roxbury consistently have
more applicants than schools that parents feel are inferior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fight among those in the know; those who know how to
work the system,'' said Jacqueline Rivers, a black educator who
served on a task force concerning student assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know how to work the system, you take what you
can get. The middle-class parents whose kids are still in the
system and the knowledgeable parents, that's who the fight is
among.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials say a 1995 study of the system by a management
consultant showed that nearly 80 percent of parents received their
first choice of schools. But the study noted that white parents
were much less likely to get their first choice than minority
parents were.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm a parent, I say I'd like to send my child to a
particular school in South Boston,'' said Councilwoman Peggy
Davis-Mullen, an opponent of busing. ``They look it up and say, `We
have five white seats and 15 minority seats.' If there are more
than five white kids in the school, they say, `We're sorry, we
don't recommend you try that school.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In November, a federal appeals court struck down the admission
program at Boston Latin School, the city's most prestigious public
high school. The court ruled that the policy of trying to reserve
some slots at the school to maintain a racial balance was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Boston Latin ruling, some busing opponents
say the school system's ``controlled choice'' policy is vulnerable
to a similar lawsuit charging it with maintaining an illegal system
of racial quotas in certain schools.
</P>
<P>
   To some black leaders, Boston appears to be moving toward a
system in which the students will be racially separated in schools
that are supposedly equal. They are not sure whether the move is
intended to improve schools or resegregate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not in vogue to have diversity,'' said Leonard Alkins,
president of the Boston Chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. ``Affirmative action and diversity
are being attacked on all levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some blacks who support the idea of improved neighborhood
schools worry that it might result in a system in which white
neighborhoods with more political power get more resources and
better teachers than minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That continues to be a real concern,'' Ms. Rivers said. ``It's
really going to take a level of vigilance among black and Latino
activists to make sure that our schools are not short-changed.
Menino has been pretty good. But he is a politician and the squeaky
wheel tends to get the oil.''

OF TOP KHMER ROUGE, ONLY ONE AWAITS JUDGMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ In the end he was alone, the last fighter
left in the brutal three-decade-long Khmer Rouge insurgency. As his
colleagues surrendered and were embraced by the government, the
peasant general Ta Mok remained in the jungle, searching in vain
for a place to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he was captured, apparently through a deal with Thai
military units that had given him sanctuary across the border.
Instead of the embrace that greeted his comrades after their
earlier surrenders, Ta Mok, a battlefield leader with a reputation
for cruelty, was locked inside a prison cell to await trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the harsh politics of Cambodia today, it is possible that Ta
Mok will in the end be the only Khmer Rouge leader called to
account for the deaths of more than a million people between 1975
and 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of the moment suggest that his Khmer Rouge
colleagues could be left free to enjoy a quiet retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Their fate is in the hands of Prime Minister Hun Sen, whose word
is law here. So far, he has resisted calls from abroad _ and from
many Cambodians _ for the arrests of such prominent Khmer Rouge
defectors as Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday Cambodia's foreign minister, Hor Nam Hong,
formally rejected a recommendation by the United Nations that a
score of Khmer Rouge leaders, including Ta Mok, be turned over to
an impartial international tribunal. Any trials, he said, would be
held here.
</P>
<P>
   The most hated Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, died in April. For
the moment at least, it appears that the government hopes Ta Mok
will become his surrogate as the focus for recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ta Mok will be made a sacrificial animal, like the Gang of
Four in China,'' said Lao Mong Hay, a prominent human rights
advocate. ``If that happens, the issue of a Khmer Rouge trial and
the Khmer Rouge massacres and the Cambodian suffering will not have
been solved.''
</P>
<P>
   As much of the world moves toward accountability for past crimes
_ from the tribunals involving Rwanda and Bosnia to President
Clinton's apology this week for American actions in Guatemala _
Cambodia appears to be in full retreat, a diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't work just to say, `Let bygones be bygones,' '' he
said. ``Whether the leadership thinks so or not, it is in their own
country's interest to go through the painful process and confront
their past.''
</P>
<P>
   A radical Maoist movement, the Khmer Rouge caused huge numbers
of deaths when it evacuated Cambodia's cities and enforced brutal
work brigades in which people died from starvation, disease and
overwork. Many other Cambodians were killed in summary executions
and in a wave of internal purges.
</P>
<P>
   After they were driven from power by a Vietnamese invasion, the
Khmer Rouge regrouped as a jungle insurgency, continuing to enforce
Communist rule in areas they controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Ta Mok, 72, may have been an easy scapegoat. A rough-edged
peasant without the foreign education or intellectual pretensions
of other Khmer Rouge leaders, he could be harsh, savage and
capricious in his treatment of subordinates and enemies, according
to a number of accounts.
</P>
<P>
   He became known for his roughshod imposition of communal life in
Communist-controlled areas before 1975 and for his brutality
against his enemies within the movement. He was instrumental in
carrying out purges during the period of Khmer Rouge rule and has
been connected with the tortures of Tuol Sleng prison, where more
than 14,000 people were sent to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1996, when the largest Khmer Rouge-controlled region, in
Western Cambodia, had begun losing its ideological edge and living
a more relaxed capitalist life style, it was Ta Mok who tried to
lead a crackdown, causing the split that was the beginning of the
end for the Khmer Rouge.

</P>
<P>
   When, one year later, it seemed that Pol Pot's bad name was too
heavy a liability for the hard-pressed insurgency, it was Ta Mok
who engineered his ouster and arrest, then took over his
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Openly disdaining politics, however, Ta Mok did not develop the
kind of constituency or relationships within and outside the
movement that helped his colleagues negotiate their surrenders.
</P>
<P>
   And those colleagues seemed happy, once they gave up the
struggle, to point their fingers at the man they had left behind
and blame everything on him.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stance that seems to suit Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   Since the surrenders of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea in December
_ followed by their government-sponsored visits to the beach and to
the temples at Angkor _ the prime minister has been carefully
ambiguous about his plans for them. He is keeping his options open,
holding at bay competing pressure groups and foreign interests.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been the most insistent voice abroad in
urging trials. On the other side, China _ the main sponsor of the
Khmer Rouge in past years _ is expected to veto any plan for an
international tribunal that might come before the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Hun Sen has avoided definitive statements,
leaving political analysts here to debate whether his bottom line
ultimately is to punish his longtime Khmer Rouge enemies or to
dodge the uncertainties of full-fledged trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bottom line is, whatever is in Hun Sen's
interest,'' a Western diplomat said. ``So I don't think anything is
written in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Several foreign diplomats and Cambodian analysts agreed that
Hun's basic goals are to avoid instability and renewed fighting, to
maintain personal control of events and to block any revival of
Khmer Rouge power.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has warned of what he calls a new civil war
if he tries to arrest Khmer Rouge leaders who now live mostly in
remote areas that are controlled by their own troops. Those
soldiers have nominally defected to the government, although this
may in effect be little more than a change in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Hun Sen has chosen not to agree to an
international tribunal, a forum that would reduce his ability to
manage the course of events. Instead, he appears bent on trying Ta
Mok in a Cambodian court, despite the fact that he once admitted
that Cambodia's judiciary is not up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   In a report this month to the United Nations, a team of three
international lawyers said they doubted that the Cambodian legal
system had the expertise or political independence to conduct a
procedure that would be seen as just.
</P>
<P>
   They recommended against a domestically run trial, saying
Cambodia lacked ``three key criteria for a fair and effective
judiciary: a trained cadre of judges, lawyers and investigators;
adequate infrastructure, and a culture of respect for due
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, they said, ``the level of corruption in the
court system and the routine subjection of judicial decisions to
political influence would make it nearly impossible for
prosecutors, investigators and judges to be immune from such
pressure in the course of what would undoubtedly be very
politically charged trials.''
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat said he could already foresee the outcome of
a trial for Ta Mok.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be found guilty, of course,'' the diplomat said. ``I
think that has been decided already. There is no death penalty in
Cambodia, so he will be sentenced to life. Maybe at first he will
go to jail. Then he will move to house arrest in some military
camp. And then five years from now people will say, `What ever
happened to Ta Mok?' and you'll discover that he's living in a nice
villa.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If NATO's diplomats get their way, next month's 50th
birthday party in Washington will be replete with post-Cold War
symbolism, featuring top Russian officials in its large cast to
demonstrate just how well the old enemies now work side by side.
</P>
<P>
   There is just one small problem: Russia has not yet decided if
it wants the part.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin, playing as hard to get as ever, says it might
dispatch a senior representative to the celebration _ but only if a
rupture is avoided over Kosovo and limits are put on the number of
alliance troops that can be rushed during any crisis to Poland, the
Czech Republic or Hungary, who joined NATO on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years after NATO and Russia sealed a much-advertised
cooperation agreement, the two sides are still refighting old
battles over the enlargement of the Western alliance. Despite the
obvious weaknesses of Russia's military machine, its nuclear muscle
and the superpower mentality of its foreign-policy elite seem
destined to ensure that those battles grow no-less rancorous with
time.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to reassure a Russia still unhappy about NATO's
enlargement, NATO has confidentially proposed to limit crisis
deployments to bolster Poland, the Czech Republic or Hungary. The
two divisions that could be dispatched to each of these nations
under the Western plan would be equivalent to a light army corps
with about 460 tanks. The Russians, though, want to limit such
deployments to a division or even less.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian strategy, however, is to undermine NATO
effectiveness,'' said Sergei Karaganov of the Council on Foreign
and Defense Policy, a group of opinion makers with close ties to
the Russian government and military circles. ``We want to have NATO
as weak as possible because we are not part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the NATO-Russian relationship is troubled. NATO and
Russian officials meet regularly in Brussels over security policy,
and the two sides conduct joint peacekeeping patrols in Bosnia. But
the two sides have yet to establish a genuine partnership _ and the
future of the relationship looks anything but rosy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is not only trying to blunt any military advantage the
alliance derives from now admitting Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Its longer-term strategy is to discourage the alliance from
trying to include the Baltic states _ Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
_ or other former Soviet-bloc nations by making the process as
diplomatically painful as possible _ an approach Western officials
call the ``root canal'' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's anxiety over NATO, by and large, is a preoccupation of
its political elite. Virtually nobody in Russia is happy about the
alliance's decision to accept new members. But the issue ranks
relatively low on the average citizen's long litany of worries, a
list dominated by domestic concerns like soaring prices, unpaid
wages and crime.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively modulated response of the public is important
because it makes it unlikely that a rabid nationalist could rise to
power on a surge of anti-NATO resentment, the calamity many critics
of NATO expansion said they expected.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls also show that popular unease over NATO is
along generational lines _ the young are far less worried than
elderly Russians who lived through the Cold War _ and thus may fade
in time.
</P>
<P>
   But if NATO expansion has not changed the face of Russian
domestic politics, it has contributed to the sourness of the West's
diplomatic relations with Russia, already under stress from
disputes over Iraq, the former Yugoslavia and arms control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign policy is always a preoccupation of the elites,'' said
Aleksei Arbatov, a member of Parliament from the liberal Yabloko
party and an acerbic critic of NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the West's diplomacy over the last few years has been
aimed at preventing the bitterness that Russian politicians feel
over NATO's expansion from bubbling over.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to ease Russian worries, NATO negotiated a 1997 accord
with Russia, called the Founding Act, which set the terms of NATO
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that accord, the West indicated it had no plan, need
or intention to permanently station a substantial number of NATO
combat forces on the territory of its new members or to keep
nuclear weapons there. But the West stopped short of making that a
binding, legal commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also established a new NATO-Russian council, a
panel the Western alliance touted as a sign that Moscow was
adjusting itself, however painfully, to the realities of an
expanded NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the accord signaled little more than a temporary truce.
That is hardly surprising, for the debate also reflects Moscow's
deeper resentments over its loss of superpower status and over
American willingness to use its power in Iraq and Yugoslavia in the
face of Russia opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is not Poland, the Czech Republic or Hungary,''
said Toby T. Gati, a former assistant secretary of state in the
Clinton administration. ``The real issue is American power. What
the Russians do not like is that there is one country which has the
capability to act by itself and direct an alliance. NATO expansion
is not the defining issue, though it has left the Russians with a
bad taste.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's decision to expand, for example, is not the main
reason the Russian Parliament has yet to approve the Start II
strategic arms treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to ratify the accord has more to do with the U.S.
decision to bomb Iraq in December _ an attack that took place just
days before the accord was to be taken up by Russia's Parliament _
and President Clinton's surprise move to press ahead with the
testing and development of anti-missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   Even without NATO expansion, it is probably unlikely that Moscow
and Washington would be working in lock step, say, to thwart Iran's
nuclear ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Russian politicians who support reforms say the move
has taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the further isolation of Russia and has led to a
tendency here to be more critical of the United States,'' said
former Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov, a supporter of capitalist
reforms who is much admired in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been too weak to stymie the alliance's expansion
plans, but it has sought to fight a rear-guard effort. On Kosovo,
the Russians have insisted that no airstrikes be carried out
without the approval of the U.N. Security Council, where they hold
a veto.
</P>
<P>
   And President Boris Yeltsin personally warned the Americans to
keep their hands off Kosovo _ a warning that has psychologically
bolstered the Serbs in their refusal to accept NATO ground troops
in their battle-torn province.
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna, where negotiators from 30 nations are trying to
update the old East-West treaty limiting non-nuclear arms, the
Russians are seeking to blunt NATO by limiting the Western combat
forces that can be dispatched to the territory of its new members.
</P>
<P>
   Having promised not to station any permanent large contingent of
combat forces in Poland, the Czech Republic or Hungary as part of
the Founding Act, NATO says it needs the right to rush as many as
two combat divisions to any or each of those nations if a crisis
breaks out. The proposal for such emergency deployments is based on
a classified assessment of military requirements by NATO military
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sort of scenario we have in mind is a crisis short of
major aggression against the alliance, where all bets would be
off,'' a senior Western diplomat said. ``Let's say there was a
Serbian threat against Hungary. Then we want to be able to
reinforce. It might be hypothetical today, but it could become very
real if there was a Serbian decision to lash out at the
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians have insisted that the ceiling be set at one
division or even a brigade. They have informed NATO that they will
not send a top level representative to the Washington summit talks
if this matter is not worked out or if the two sides are at odds
over Kosovo, American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials say that Russia and NATO may yet come to terms
on the force limits. To make the West's proposal more palatable,
for example, the United States is privately encouraging Poland to
cut 200 more tanks from its arsenal than it had previously planned,
something Western officials say Poland can do by getting rid of old
models in storage.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has also told the Russians that it is willing to relax
limits on the number of Russian armored personnel carriers on its
southern flank, a region that greatly concerns Russia, as it
includes the volatile Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   And a number of senior diplomats, including Foreign Minister
Robin Cook of Britain, have assured Moscow that the alliance will
not use the Washington meeting to issue a new flurry of invitations
to potential NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this will be enough to induce Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov or Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to make the Washington
trip, as the Clinton administration would like, is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unlikely to change the basic stance among Russian
foreign-policy specialists toward the alliance. Sergei Rogov, the
director of the U.S.A.-Canada Institute, a research center on
Russian-Western relations, said it was possible the two sides could
learn to work together effectively, but added he was not
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that NATO is enlarging despite our objections and is
claiming the role of the dominant security organization in Europe
is perceived here as a negative,'' Rogov said. ``We are being
marginalized.''

COMMENTARY: BUSH VS. BLACKMUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(repeating to fix coding)  (bl)  
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both considered themselves moderate Republicans and both were
faced with the tough issue of abortion. One made a stand on
principle and will be remembered as a man of courage and integrity.
The other has carefully gauged the direction of the wind, and may
well end up as president.
</P>
<P>
   The early 1970s was still a treacherous time for women or girls
who wanted to terminate a pregnancy. Thousands of women,
particularly those who were well educated and well off financially,
were able to get legal abortions through physicians willing to
engage in some charade, like claiming the mother's life was in
danger. Some wealthy women could get illegal abortions that were
reasonably safe, or go overseas for abortions. But the vast
majority of women and girls who wanted an abortion had no
alternative but to roll the dice on a criminal procedure that might
be performed in some wretched undercover location by some inept
practitioner using unsanitary and often unscientific methods.
</P>
<P>
   Many thousands died.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew how Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, a Nixon
appointee, would approach the issue of a woman's right to an
abortion when Roe vs. Wade came before the Supreme Court. Blackmun
was a quiet, modest Midwesterner, a lifelong Republican and close
friend of the conservative chief justice, Warren Burger. He was
selected for the court largely because he was perceived as a
hard-liner on crime. He was an unlikely candidate to be the author
and decades-long champion of a decision that was as controversial
and guaranteed such radical consequences as Roe.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times' Linda Greenhouse, in Blackmun's obituary
March 5, wrote: ``The care with which Justice Blackmun approached
the issue was evident from the opening passage of his opinion, in
which he acknowledged `the deep and seemingly absolute convictions
that the subject inspires.'''
</P>
<P>
   The vote on Roe was 7-2, but Blackmun, as the author, was most
closely identified with the ruling. He was both revered and
vilified as a result. But no amount of obloquy could make him doubt
the correctness or the value of the decision. When he retired in
1994 he described the ruling as a step that had to be taken
``toward the full emancipation of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to George W. Bush. The last thing he wants to do as
he gallops toward the presidency is to take a clear and unequivocal
principled stand on abortion. If he were to favor a woman's right
to choose, he would be ambushed from the right. And if he were to
absolutely follow what he says is in his heart and in his mind _
that we should amend the Constitution and ban abortion outright _
the boulders would immediately begin falling on him from the left.
</P>
<P>
   Poor George. There is nothing left to do but equivocate.
</P>
<P>
   So, in an interview with The Associated Press last week, the
Texas governor and leading contender for the Republican
presidential nomination, said he would support a constitutional
amendment to outlaw abortions, except in cases of rape or incest,
or where the life of the woman was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' he said, ``I'm a realistic enough person
to know that America is not ready to ban abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bush, ``America is not ready to overturn Roe vs.
Wade because America's hearts are not right. And so, in the
meantime, instead of arguing over Roe vs. Wade, what we ought to do
is promote policies to reduce abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Got that? If you don't want to overturn Roe vs. Wade, your
heart's not right. Maybe under the guidance and leadership of
President Bush II, your heart will get right. And with our hearts
right, and a couple of new Clarence Thomases on the Supreme Court,
all things are possible. America can finally get rid of Roe, put
women back in their place and return to the glorious years of
back-alley abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, said of Blackmun: ``He had an
ability to take the law out of the abstract and understand its
effect on the lives of real people. His primary motivation was to
see that the law was fair and that it provided dignity for the
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's primary motivation is to get to the White
House. The last thing he wants to do is stumble upon a principle.

 &HT;    Teen E-pals turn war correspondents
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Each morning, 16-year-old Finnegan
Hamill turns on his Macintosh computer in sunny, peaceful Berkeley,
Calif., and downloads his e-mail from a nightmare zone, nearly half
a planet away.
</P>
<P>
   For over a month now Hamill, a reporter for Youth Radio in the
San Francisco Bay area, has been conducting an electronic
correspondence with a teen-age Albanian girl named Adona, who is
living a harrowing, precarious life in the war-ravaged province of
Kosovo. She is surrounded by a war zone, where rival Serbian and
Albanian militias are killing each other and massacring civilians
for control of this parcel of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Adona's letters to Hamill, some of which have been read on
National Public Radio, have brought the war home to millions of
Americans in simple, human terms. They have a quality resembling
the diaries of Anne Frank, that of innocence struggling to cope
with evil.
</P>
<P>
   Hamill and Adona might be two teen-age pen pals, discussing
hobbies, music, growing up _ except one of them is living in daily,
nightly fear of being raped and murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know how many people get killed anymore,'' Adona
wrote in one of her e-mails. ``You just see them in the memoriam
pages of newspapers. I really don't want to end up raped, with no
parts of body like the massacred ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish nobody in the world, in the whole universe, would have
to go through what we are. You don't know how lucky you are to have
a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammill obtained Adona's e-mail address at a church youth group
meeting, at the First Congregational Church in Berkeley, from a
peace worker who had visited Kosovo recently. He went home, turned
on his computer and sent her a tentative e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Adona wrote back. ``I was surprised how open she was. The first
letter or two we just told each other about ourselves, but after
that she began describing the war, and what it was doing to her
life, in great detail. She was very outgoing and open. There is
kind of a dynamic between us.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago her life was relatively normal. She got
mad when her parents wouldn't let her stay out late at night. Now
they have to huddle in their apartment at night and pray they won't
get shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty incredible to imagine what their life is like.
Their life is basically paralyzed,'' Hammill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know,'' Adona wrote in another letter, ``you don't
know how I am longing to go to a party, on a trip, or anywhere ...
I love listening to Rolling Stones, Sade, Jewel, Cher ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I must tell you _ it is scary sometimes, when the situation
gets really tense. The whole family comes together and we talk
about how and where we will be going in case of emergency, where we
can find money, what do we do, who do we call for help, where do we
keep our passports and other documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have bought warm clothes in case we have to flee our
homes and go to the mountains or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night last week, I think, we were all surrounded by police
and armed forces, and if it wasn't for the OSCE (Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe) observers, God knows how many
victims there would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my flat was surrounded too. I cannot describe you the fear
... The next day a few meters from my flat, they killed this
Albanian journalist, Enver Maloku. Someday before there was a bomb
explosion in the center of town where young people usually go
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The horrific violence in Kosovo contrasts strangely with the
cool, luminous letters that show up on Hamill's computer screen,
thousands of miles away, relayed instantly by the Internet. Adona
is close in time, half a world away in space, easily reachable, yet
quite impossible to reach. The peril in which she lives makes
Hamill wonder if one day the e-mails will suddenly cease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It put my own life in perspective,'' the reporter said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamill grew up with computers. ``My family has had one since
1988,'' he said. Adona and her sister had to work, to save up
enough cash to buy their computer. It still lacks a scanner, so
Hamill has no idea what the young woman who is sending him such
striking e-mail looks like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see if I can get her out of there somehow,''
Hamill said. ``She has expressed some interest in coming to the
United States and going to school here.''

U.N.   SECURITY COUNCIL INCREASINGLY RELEGATED TO THE SIDELINES
</HEADLINE>
  
(repeating to fix coding)  (rk) 
 By   JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In a world with conflicts raging from Angola to
Kosovo, the U.N. Security Council, the heart of the world body,
finds itself increasingly marginalized.
</P>
<P>
   The causes, diplomats say, are many, but among the most
important is America's growing impatience with the council's often
laborious decision-making process and Washington's increasing
resort to regional groups to stop or prevent increasingly local
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   A result, many agree, has been the U.N.'s growing irrelevance to
many major conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is the Security Council on Kosovo?'' said Herbert S.
Okun, a former American ambassador and an adviser to the United
Nations on international drug issues. ``Or Ethiopia? Or even
Iraq?''
</P>
<P>
   Nabil A. Elaraby, who is leaving his post as Egypt's
representative and who has served on the Security Council, called
the council's record in the last five years ``nothing to be proud
of'' and ``lamentable'' of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Security Council is doing more and more things,'' said
David Malone, a former Canadian diplomat at the United Nations and
president of the International Peace Academy, a research
organization that studies it. ``But the things it is doing seem to
matter less and less.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the Security Council has been sidelined as NATO has
essentially taken over management of the conflict and efforts to
find a solution. Any peacekeeping operation there would be run by
NATO, as well as any decision to use force. Although some European
nations want the Security Council to have a say, it has been cut
out of any such role, primarily by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, the U.N. regime intended to monitor Iraq's weapons
program has been stymied by Baghdad's refusal to cooperate. With
Russia, France and China increasingly hostile to economic sanctions
against Baghdad or the use of force, the United States and Britain
have been pursuing policies independent of the council, conducting
nearly daily bombing raids over Iraq. Meanwhile, three recently
formed U.N. panels are trying to find a solution to the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   In other places as well, U.N. efforts have been thwarted,
rebuffed or ignored. The number of U.N. peacekeepers in the field
has dropped from 80,000 a decade ago to 17,000 today. Last month,
China pulled the plug on a peacekeeping force for Macedonia, which
has helped keep chaos in the Balkans from spreading since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council members, faced with opposition from Angola to a
U. N. presence, recently voted to end their peacekeeping mission
there. And on the Horn of Africa, the Security Council has proved
powerless to persuade Ethiopia and Eritrea to settle their border
dispute peacefully, leaving mediation largely to the regional
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials and others have in recent
months blamed Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been at odds
with the administration over its policy toward Iraq, for the
malaise.
</P>
<P>
   To help ease tensions, Annan traveled to Washington in February
to smooth relations and try to persuade Congress to pay more than a
billion dollars in past dues. The trip was a personal success for
Annan, diplomats agreed. But it failed to address what many call
the underlying causes of the deep divisions that have disabled the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Those divisions and the resulting paralysis, they say, reflect
underlying political shifts that may be difficult for any
secretary-general, or the United Nations, to address.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, analysts say, is Russia's decline as a world power
and its determination to prove that it is a still a force to be
reckoned with by vetoing, or threatening to veto, many
American-backed proposals in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   But Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Annan's predecessor who was barred
from a second term by Clinton administration opposition, blames the
U.S. for sidelining the Security Council on key issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview since his departure, Boutros-Ghali said the
problem was that growing opposition to American policy within the
Security Council has more and more often divided its five permanent
members _ the United States, Russia, Britain, France, and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marginalization began in 1993 with the Somalia
intervention and the subsequent change of majority in Congress,''
Boutros-Ghali said, referring to the killing of American soldiers
in the failed peacekeeping mission in Somalia and the later victory
of what he called Republican ``isolationists'' in the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It increased, he said, with ``America's discovery of its role as
the sole remaining superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Weaker states depend heavily on diplomacy,'' Boutros-Ghali
said. ``When you're powerful, you don't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative to the United
Nations, said that the Security Council's paralysis on key issues
reflected what he called a ``change of culture'' since the end of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic conflicts within states are now at least as common as
interstate disputes, he said, but harder for the Security Council
to address. ``Political identity is shrinking when it should be
expanding,'' he said, and ``nations increasingly pursue their own,
rather than the collective, interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy, whose country has most often and most staunchly
supported Washington, refused to blame any one state for the
council's malaise. But, he continued, it was ``shortsighted'' of
the administration to ignore or sidestep the Security Council, even
if it does take time and effort to secure a consensus there.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's representative, Nabil Elaraby, echoing a growing
resentment of what several diplomats called American ``bullying''
at the United Nations, said, ``Of the five permanent members, there
is increasingly only one.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials rejected such complaints, noting, for
example, that the Security Council had by most standard legal
interpretations authorized the bombing and use of force against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Washington, one official added, had spent ``hours and
hours'' consulting with Russian officials, trying to head off
confrontations where possible and secure at least implicit
acceptance of American policy in conflicts ranging from Iraq to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go out of our way to consult with Russia,'' a senior
administration official said. ``But on some key issues, as the
United Nations Charter clearly allows, we must protect our national
interests.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, one diplomat said on the condition of
anonymity, Washington uses the council ``selectively,'' to find
multilateral cover for its policies, relying on regional
organizations instead to legitimize force when a Russian or Chinese
veto seems likely.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Annan said that it was ``natural'' for
NATO to handle the Kosovo crisis, since the ``United Nations
Charter urges regional organizations'' to deal with such conflicts.
``It's not marginalizing the United Nations,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he said, he hoped the United States would consult with the
Security Council if efforts to negotiate a peaceful solution to the
crisis fail and military force is to be used. Annan disagrees with
American policy on Iraq, which he says ``goes far beyond Security
Council resolutions'' by which he is bound.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Gelb, president of the council on Foreign Relations and a
former columnist for The New York Times, said that the
administration, unable to persuade fellow council members of the
wisdom of its policy towards Iraq, which calls for removing Saddam
Hussein whether or not he accepts weapons inspectors back into the
country, has made Annan and its United Nations ``convenient
whipping boys'' for ``confused policy''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not Kofi Annan, the most pro-Western and
pro-American secretary-general Washington has had, or is likely to
have,'' Gelb said. ``And it's not an unyielding Security Council.
Sure, on some issues, Russia and China won't budge. But usually
when the United States has a clear, convincing policy, it gets its
way on the council. Maybe our policy is neither anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats expressed confidence that the Security Council
would eventually return to center stage, if only because there was
no real alternative to the legitimation its decisions provide.
Annan, for one, argued that the limitations of relying on regional
groups instead to sanction the use of force were already becoming
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see, say, NATO being used to solve security problems
outside Europe,'' Annan said, referring to the cool reception NATO
members gave an American proposal to involve it in anti-drug and
anti-terrorism work. ``Ultimately, I'm sure everyone will decide it
is wiser to press for and work within a harmonious council.''

A ROAD-KILL PROPOSAL LEAVES A FUNNY TASTE
</HEADLINE>
  
(repeating to fix coding) 
(ATTN: Tenn.)  (nk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ If only the bill had contained the word
``deer,'' then perhaps the possum jokes could have been stopped
flat. If the bill had just made it clear that someone who hits a
deer on the highway can take home the carcass and eat it, then
maybe Tennessee would have been spared all the raccoon cookbooks,
the dead-skunk songs, the bumper stickers, the sniggering
headlines, the laughter that has lighted up the Legislature for the
last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But no. With an unerring genius for the kind of thing that makes
many Tennesseans squirm, the author of the bill decided to phrase
it this way: ``Wild animals accidentally killed by a motor vehicle
may be possessed by any person for personal use and consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it would be legal to eat road kill. Legal to eat
the thousands of squirrels, opossums, raccoons and rabbits that
meet a painfully horizontal death every year beneath rubber tires.
As if a state law were preventing anyone from scraping a Happy Meal
off the asphalt. As if anyone would even dream of it.
</P>
<P>
   From the clamor of the reaction, it seemed as if the state
government had ordered a reversion to Tennessee's mountain-man
roots, closing the groceries and forcing residents to hunt for
their supper. ``Grease the skillet, Ma! New bill will make road
kill legal eatin','' read a headline in The Knoxville News-Sentinel
last month. ``Better fetch ol' Granny's recipe for possum stew,''
said an article in The Commercial Appeal of Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Radio show hosts had a field day. Tim Burchett, the
notoriety-loving state Senator who proposed the law, was inundated
with comic cookbooks and tips on bringing out the best flavor from
a 'coon stew. One of the bumper stickers he received read, ``Cat _
The Other White Meat.'' (Actually, cats and dogs were exempted from
the bill.)
</P>
<P>
   Legislators and lobbyists were unending in their gibes,
prompting him to holler at a dinner party: ``One of these dishes
was made with road kill. And I'm not going to tell you which one!''
The host was not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, there is a legitimate-sounding premise to the
legislation, though it immediately became known as the road-kill
bill. Burchett, a Republican who represents the Knoxville area, was
recently contacted by a constituent who was fined after he
accidentally hit a deer and then gave the meat to a migrant family.
The law currently requires that such accidents be reported
immediately to the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, which must
tag the animal before it can be consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Such accidents happen with increasing frequency in Tennessee,
where the deer herd has multiplied more than 200-fold over the last
50 years to its current record size of nearly 1 million. The
wildlife agency estimates that there are 10,000 collisions every
year between vehicles and deer, and without enough wildlife
officers to tag each deer and citizens forbidden to eat a carcass
until it is tagged, Burchett believes the tagging requirement is an
infringement upon personal liberty. Not to mention a waste of
perfectly good venison, which, he adds soulfully, could be donated
to the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, because it's Tennessee, everyone's going to make us
look like a bunch of hayseed rednecks, and I understand that, and I
know the media's getting a big kick out of this,'' Burchett said.
``But after all, the government's supposed to help people with
their problems, and this is just a common-sense thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Burchett said he wrote ``wild animals'' into the bill instead of
deer in case the state regulates other big-game animals around
Tennessee, a move that seems unlikely. But the senator, not
uncomfortable with publicity, acknowledges a certain taste for
legislation that many have considered off the wall. He has, over
the years, proposed bills to require the castration of both child
molesters and stray animals, to repeal the law requiring
motorcyclists to wear helmets, and to require driver's license
applicants to pay for their own interpreters if they do not speak
English. All have received considerable attention, as well as a few
clucks from sober-minded editorialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``In four years, people aren't going to remember road kill,
they'll just remember Burchett,'' the senator said, adding that he
plans to distribute cans of (fake) possum meat to his colleagues
when the bill reaches the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal certainly drew the attention of the wildlife
agency, which raised concerns that some motorists would
deliberately try to ``bumper-hunt'' deer by running them over and
claiming it was an accident. Burchett played down such fears, but
agreed to add an amendment that allows consumption of road kill as
long as the driver notifies the local police within 48 hours. The
agency, satisfied that it could keep track of the deer population
this way, signed off on the bill, which is now expected to be
approved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tennessee, like so many other states, is often torn between
pride and embarrassment at certain aspects of its heritage, and
intentionally or not, the road-kill bill only heightened that
ambivalence. Many legislators won't even discuss the bill any
longer, rolling their eyes and trying to change the subject to more
pressing legislation, such as the plan to revamp the state-funded
health care program, or Gov. Don Sundquist's proposal to replace
some sales taxes with a business tax.
</P>
<P>
   But as noted by state Rep. Tommy Head, who is sponsoring the
road-kill bill in the House, there is a reason that the Speaker of
the House, Jimmy Naifeh, sponsors a 'coon supper every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of rural people in this state who understand
what this is about,'' said Head, from Clarksville. ``Personally, I
don't care for 'coon. I don't like the taste of 'coon. But we've
got a lot of people at home who have 'coon dogs and hunt for 'coon.
Of course, not with their cars.''

   IMMIGRANT-TEENS (New York) _ Over the last several years, a
small but growing number of teen-agers _ virtually all boys, some
as young as 14 or 15 _ have arrived without their parents, much
like the child immigrants of a century ago. Once here, they become
New York's youngest immigrant workers, their cheap, nimble labor
easily absorbed by the city's thriving service economy. Yet they
are trapped in an underground ruled in large measure by fear _ of
the immigration authorities, child welfare agencies, smugglers,
thugs and bosses, past and potential. And immigration scholars and
social workers wonder if they will ever be able to break free. By

SCIENTISTS LOOK TO NATURAL OILS TO REPLACE TOXIC COMPOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: W.Va., Fla., Calif.) (jw) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government scientists have found that the harmless
natural oil that gives peaches their perfume also kills fungus and
other pests in the soil and could replace methyl bromide, a widely
used pesticide that is toxic to people and also damages the
planet's protective ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   The peachy compound, called benzaldehyde, is manufactured
synthetically. It is already used commercially in perfumes,
flavorings, drugs and dyes, as are many other similar oils, like
those distilled from lemon and peppermint.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Agricultural Research Service, along with
colleagues in South Africa and Israel, have been screening these
natural chemicals for several years to see if they can be
substituted for more dangerous man-made compounds. The essence of
peach looks like an especially promising candidate, said Charles
Wilson, a plant pathologist at the agency's Appalachian Fruit
Research Station in Kearneysville, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   His team developed a laboratory method for testing the extract
against some of the most important pests that methyl bromide
attacks, and when it proved effective they developed a new approach
for applying benzaldehyde onto soil using granules of activated
charcoal saturated with the fragrant chemical.
</P>
<P>
   If field tests prove successful, the scientists hope, it could
be a significant breakthrough in ridding the world of methyl
bromide. Like other chemicals such as CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons,
methyl bromide is supposed to be phased out under the Montreal
Protocol, a 1987 treaty. The ozone layer is important because it
shields the earth from the sun's ultraviolet rays, which cause
cancer and other environmental harm.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, bowing to protests by farmers who said that it
was impossible for the United States to end methyl bromide's use as
scheduled in 2001, Congress gave the industry until 2005 to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the delay, its use next year is supposed to be 25
percent less than the amount used in 1990, and methyl bromide use
is supposed to decrease rapidly over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   That has alarmed many farmers, especially those like California
strawberry growers and Florida tomato growers who use the chemical
most extensively. Every year, they cover their fields with plastic
suits and workers inject the gas under the sheets. Some of it soaks
into the soil; some of it escapes into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said in an interview that he doubted that any single
compound, like the peach oil, would be a ``magic bullet'' to
replace methyl bromide. But he said he was optimistic that
combinations of naturally occurring chemicals, along with other
changes in farming methods, would provide important benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a broad range of these things that are in nature
already, and there has not been that much effort yet in trying to
fish them out,'' he said. ``The synthetic compounds were so
powerful that we stopped looking for natural pesticides.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that oils of wintergreen and clove might also prove
useful.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not only does the peach essence kill off pathogens like Fusarium
oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium aphanidermatum, and
Sclerotinia minor, the researchers found, but it seems to favor
other, beneficial organisms in the soil that then continue to
muscle out the unwanted pests.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural scientists have been exploring many different
substitutes for methyl bromide, but most of them have been
synthetic chemicals that, while they do not damage the ozone layer,
are not entirely harmless.
</P>
<P>
   Kert Davies, a researcher at the Environmental Working Group,
which lobbies against pesticide use, said that the burgeoning
research into natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals had broad
implications for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Replacing methyl bromide is like a moon mission,'' he said.
``We are discovering all these other things. We are discovering the
Tang of agriculture _ farmers who never even thought of using
methyl bromide are going to get the spinoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   But he criticized the Agriculture Department for not moving even
faster to come up with alternatives, and said some farmers had been
reluctant to test alternatives because they found continuing to use
methyl bromide simpler, given that Congress was willing to extend
its use.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Duafala, the chief of research at Trical, a company in
Hollister, Calif., that applies methyl bromide and other pesticides
on farms, said that it might take years to get regulatory approval
for any new pesticide, and he said it was hard to come up with any
single substitute as powerful and effective as methyl bromide for
treating soils.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been looking for alternatives to methyl bromide as
long as I have been involved with methyl bromide, which is 20
years,'' Duafala said. ``Will this result in something useful down
the road? I don't know, but there are a lot of ideas to be
explored, and this is exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we will be able to come up with several things,''
he said. ``But it will not happen in the immediate future.''

U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL INCREASINGLY RELEGATED TO THE SIDELINES
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS to fix slug, U.N. sted U.S.) 
 (rk) 
 By   JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In a world with conflicts raging from Angola to
Kosovo, the U.N. Security Council, the heart of the world body,
finds itself increasingly marginalized.
</P>
<P>
   The causes, diplomats say, are many, but among the most
important is America's growing impatience with the council's often
laborious decision-making process and Washington's increasing
resort to regional groups to stop or prevent increasingly local
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   A result, many agree, has been the U.N.'s growing irrelevance to
many major conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is the Security Council on Kosovo?'' said Herbert S.
Okun, a former American ambassador and an adviser to the United
Nations on international drug issues. ``Or Ethiopia? Or even
Iraq?''
</P>
<P>
   Nabil A. Elaraby, who is leaving his post as Egypt's
representative and who has served on the Security Council, called
the council's record in the last five years ``nothing to be proud
of'' and ``lamentable'' of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Security Council is doing more and more things,'' said
David Malone, a former Canadian diplomat at the United Nations and
president of the International Peace Academy, a research
organization that studies it. ``But the things it is doing seem to
matter less and less.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the Security Council has been sidelined as NATO has
essentially taken over management of the conflict and efforts to
find a solution. Any peacekeeping operation there would be run by
NATO, as well as any decision to use force. Although some European
nations want the Security Council to have a say, it has been cut
out of any such role, primarily by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, the U.N. regime intended to monitor Iraq's weapons
program has been stymied by Baghdad's refusal to cooperate. With
Russia, France and China increasingly hostile to economic sanctions
against Baghdad or the use of force, the United States and Britain
have been pursuing policies independent of the council, conducting
nearly daily bombing raids over Iraq. Meanwhile, three recently
formed U.N. panels are trying to find a solution to the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   In other places as well, U.N. efforts have been thwarted,
rebuffed or ignored. The number of U.N. peacekeepers in the field
has dropped from 80,000 a decade ago to 17,000 today. Last month,
China pulled the plug on a peacekeeping force for Macedonia, which
has helped keep chaos in the Balkans from spreading since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council members, faced with opposition from Angola to a
U. N. presence, recently voted to end their peacekeeping mission
there. And on the Horn of Africa, the Security Council has proved
powerless to persuade Ethiopia and Eritrea to settle their border
dispute peacefully, leaving mediation largely to the regional
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials and others have in recent
months blamed Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been at odds
with the administration over its policy toward Iraq, for the
malaise.
</P>
<P>
   To help ease tensions, Annan traveled to Washington in February
to smooth relations and try to persuade Congress to pay more than a
billion dollars in past dues. The trip was a personal success for
Annan, diplomats agreed. But it failed to address what many call
the underlying causes of the deep divisions that have disabled the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Those divisions and the resulting paralysis, they say, reflect
underlying political shifts that may be difficult for any
secretary-general, or the United Nations, to address.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, analysts say, is Russia's decline as a world power
and its determination to prove that it is a still a force to be
reckoned with by vetoing, or threatening to veto, many
American-backed proposals in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   But Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Annan's predecessor who was barred
from a second term by Clinton administration opposition, blames the
U.S. for sidelining the Security Council on key issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview since his departure, Boutros-Ghali said the
problem was that growing opposition to American policy within the
Security Council has more and more often divided its five permanent
members _ the United States, Russia, Britain, France, and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marginalization began in 1993 with the Somalia
intervention and the subsequent change of majority in Congress,''
Boutros-Ghali said, referring to the killing of American soldiers
in the failed peacekeeping mission in Somalia and the later victory
of what he called Republican ``isolationists'' in the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It increased, he said, with ``America's discovery of its role as
the sole remaining superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Weaker states depend heavily on diplomacy,'' Boutros-Ghali
said. ``When you're powerful, you don't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative to the United
Nations, said that the Security Council's paralysis on key issues
reflected what he called a ``change of culture'' since the end of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic conflicts within states are now at least as common as
interstate disputes, he said, but harder for the Security Council
to address. ``Political identity is shrinking when it should be
expanding,'' he said, and ``nations increasingly pursue their own,
rather than the collective, interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy, whose country has most often and most staunchly
supported Washington, refused to blame any one state for the
council's malaise. But, he continued, it was ``shortsighted'' of
the administration to ignore or sidestep the Security Council, even
if it does take time and effort to secure a consensus there.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's representative, Nabil Elaraby, echoing a growing
resentment of what several diplomats called American ``bullying''
at the United Nations, said, ``Of the five permanent members, there
is increasingly only one.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials rejected such complaints, noting, for
example, that the Security Council had by most standard legal
interpretations authorized the bombing and use of force against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Washington, one official added, had spent ``hours and
hours'' consulting with Russian officials, trying to head off
confrontations where possible and secure at least implicit
acceptance of American policy in conflicts ranging from Iraq to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go out of our way to consult with Russia,'' a senior
administration official said. ``But on some key issues, as the
United Nations Charter clearly allows, we must protect our national
interests.''

</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, one diplomat said on the condition of
anonymity, Washington uses the council ``selectively,'' to find
multilateral cover for its policies, relying on regional
organizations instead to legitimize force when a Russian or Chinese
veto seems likely.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Annan said that it was ``natural'' for
NATO to handle the Kosovo crisis, since the ``United Nations
Charter urges regional organizations'' to deal with such conflicts.
``It's not marginalizing the United Nations,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he said, he hoped the United States would consult with the
Security Council if efforts to negotiate a peaceful solution to the
crisis fail and military force is to be used. Annan disagrees with
American policy on Iraq, which he says ``goes far beyond Security
Council resolutions'' by which he is bound.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Gelb, president of the council on Foreign Relations and a
former columnist for The New York Times, said that the
administration, unable to persuade fellow council members of the
wisdom of its policy towards Iraq, which calls for removing Saddam
Hussein whether or not he accepts weapons inspectors back into the
country, has made Annan and its United Nations ``convenient
whipping boys'' for ``confused policy''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not Kofi Annan, the most pro-Western and
pro-American secretary-general Washington has had, or is likely to
have,'' Gelb said. ``And it's not an unyielding Security Council.
Sure, on some issues, Russia and China won't budge. But usually
when the United States has a clear, convincing policy, it gets its
way on the council. Maybe our policy is neither anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats expressed confidence that the Security Council
would eventually return to center stage, if only because there was
no real alternative to the legitimation its decisions provide.
Annan, for one, argued that the limitations of relying on regional
groups instead to sanction the use of force were already becoming
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see, say, NATO being used to solve security problems
outside Europe,'' Annan said, referring to the cool reception NATO
members gave an American proposal to involve it in anti-drug and
anti-terrorism work. ``Ultimately, I'm sure everyone will decide it
is wiser to press for and work within a harmonious council.''

IN NEW TALKS ON KOSOVO, NATO'S CREDIBILITY IS AT STAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With KOSOVO-BOMBING) 
 (DW) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

<P>
   PARIS _ When peace talks on Kosovo resume here on Monday, not
only the fate of the province's two million people but also the
credibility of European diplomacy and the NATO military alliance
will hang in the balance, European and American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   France and Britain, who are leading the talks, plan to give
Serbian and ethnic Albanian negotiators only two to three days to
accept an international peace plan for autonomy in Kosovo worked
out last month or face the consequences, according to allied
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But allied resolve hangs on final acceptance of the plan by
Albanian military commanders who have been battling with Serbian
forces for independence of the southern Serbian province, where 90
percent of the population is ethnic Albanian. The proposed accord
offers Kosovo autonomy for the next three years, and leaves its
fate after that uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   A key Kosovo Liberation Army negotiator, Hashim Thaci, said
before leaving for Paris Saturday, ``The definitive answer will be
given in Paris.'' Other Albanian delegates have said the answer
will be ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Albanians do sign the deal by Monday, officials say, then
the Serbs will be confronted with a clear NATO ultimatum: Accept
the plan within two or three days, and some 26,000 allied
peacekeepers to enforce it, or risk an allied bombing campaign that
could wipe out much of Serbia's sophisticated air defenses and
other sensitive targets within a week.
</P>
<P>
   But less than 48 hours before the talks were to start, the
Albanians still had not signed, and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic had not budged from rejection of numerous appeals by
European, American and Russian officials to agree to take the
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to focus all the pressure we can on Milosevic, and
that is handicapped without a clear Albanian `yes,' '' a senior
NATO diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from Yugoslavia, of which Serbia is the dominant
component, agreed to provisions restoring autonomy to Kosovo that
were worked out in last month's talks in Rambouillet outside Paris,
which broke off on Feb. 23. But Milosevic has insisted that 2,000
unarmed civilian observers who have been monitoring an unsuccessful
cease-fire in Kosovo since last October would be enough to
supervise a new agreement.
</P>
<P>
   These observers would have to be evacuated before any bombing
started, allied military commanders say. The official in charge of
the observers, William Walker, told allied officials in Brussels
Saturday that they could be evacuated in 8 to 12 hours, but only if
Serbian forces did not try to prevent them from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's no resolution, and we go in with air strikes, I'm
afraid this will end NATO's relationship with the Russians,'' an
allied official in Brussels said, ``but if we don't go with air
strikes, then NATO loses its credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Milosevic, who as Serbia's leader a decade ago abolished
autonomy for Kosovo, would back down after an initial salvo or
brave a complete phased campaign against his air defense system is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials, starting with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, were taken by surprise by the reluctance of the Albanian
armed rebels to settle for an agreement that would require them to
disband, but ensure an armed international presence for at least
three years to keep Serbian security forces mostly out of the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's personal involvement in the Rambouillet talks is now
regarded by American and European officials as a risky gamble that
backfired.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Solana, the alliance's top civilian leader, was given
authority at the end of January to launch a two-phase bombing
campaign against the Serbs, but only if they were the main obstacle
to ending a year of fighting that has killed an estimated 2,000
people and driven 200,000 others from their homes in the province.
</P>
<P>
   If the Albanians come to the table Monday but will not sign,
European and American officials say, Solana is unlikely to order
the air armada into action. The air power ranged against Serbia
includes American cruise missiles launched from Navy ships in the
Adriatic, hundreds of fighter-bombers based in Italy, and even
B-52s operating from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   If the alliance was paralyzed by Albanian refusal to sign, a
threat already devalued by Milosevic's violation of terms he agreed
to last October would evaporate. But French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine has told allied officials that if the warring parties are
not ready to make peace, international negotiators may have to let
them fight it out.
</P>
<P>
   New fighting in the past week, allied officials say, has created
another 10,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials in Brussels said that they already had moved
10,000 troops, the vanguard of the prospective force, into
neighboring Macedonia. Some 26,000 soldiers could start fanning out
across Kosovo within a week of any agreement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The allies would like to include Russian troops among the
peacekeepers if they do go in. But officials in Brussels said that
Russia was objecting to putting them under NATO command. Plans for
the force would put the peacekeepers under a British general, Sir
Michael Walker, with a French deputy. The entire force would have
14,000 French and British troops and 4,000 Americans, and Walker
would report to NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Wesley K.
Clark, an American.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, speaking to French military officials in Paris Saturday,
said, ``We're at a very dangerous position in this situation.''
Serbian forces in Kosovo, he said, were now seven to eight times
more than the level Milosevic had agreed to last October.
</P>
<P>
   With the final outcome of talks uncertain, Vedrine and his
co-chairman, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, have not
announced whether they would be in attendance when the negotiators
reconvene Monday morning in a French government conference center
near the Arc de Triomphe.
</P>
<P>
   The building was the site of talks between the United States and
Vietnam that produced an agreement allowing American withdrawal in
1973. Earlier, when the building was the Hotel Majestic, it was the
German military headquarters for occupied France from 1940 to 1944.

<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ A crushing load of cases is forcing a
reshaping of the federal appeals courts, creating a two-level
justice system in which tens of thousands of appeals receive
limited reviews, judges and legal scholars say.
</P>
<P>
   Some judges say the changes are necessary for judges on the
appeals courts _ which are second in importance only to the Supreme
Court _ to cope with the steadily growing number of cases without
increasing the length of time people must wait for rulings.
</P>
<P>
   But as fewer than half of all federal appeals cases are argued
before judges and only a fourth of all decisions are rendered in
full published opinions _ many decisions consist of a single word,
like ``affirmed,'' upholding the lower court's decision _ critics
say the United States' circuit appeals courts are changing their
role, with people's legal rights often damaged by the shift.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reviewing every case that comes before them, as
federal law requires, the critics say, the appeals courts are
becoming more like the Supreme Court, which has the power to decide
which cases it will hear.
</P>
<P>
   Complex civil rights, antitrust and other cases that appeals
judges deem important get the same detailed consideration as
always. But some judges and legal scholars say that entire classes
of appeals deemed routine, such as petitions from prison inmates
and individuals' disability claims under Social Security, get
abbreviated attention as staff lawyers sort out cases to recommend
for full hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a two-track system, and the tracks basically get
allocated by nonjudges,'' said Patricia Wald, a judge on the
District of Columbia U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The country's 12 regional federal circuit courts began
reorganizing themselves in the 1980s, introducing shortcuts in the
way they review appeals to help judges cope with the number of
cases, which grew to 53,805 last year from 33,360 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most controversial changes, the appeals courts
created new staff lawyer positions, permanent employees with the
authority to screen and, some critics say, to effectively decide
thousands of cases by giving judges brief summaries of recommended
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question of whether the new shortcuts are fair has been
put squarely before one of the appeals courts that has led the
changes, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, in an
appeal of a political corruption case in Fort Myers, on Florida's
Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, lawyers for a former county commissioner convicted
of depriving her constituents of her ``honest services'' are trying
to challenge a one-word ruling upholding the conviction _
``affirmed'' _ by a three-judge panel. Her lawyers contend that it
is not even possible for them to tell why her appeal was denied,
much less to try to appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers have asked the full 12-member court to review the
decision as well as the court's streamlined appeals procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The case has attracted national attention among defense lawyers,
partly because the Atlanta court is known as one of the architects
of abbreviated appeals procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Some judges and scholars say the proliferation of one-word
decisions and other abbreviated procedures is shortchanging
litigants in the appellate process by limiting the consideration
given to their cases by appeals judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many procedural shortcuts that appeals today are
processed in a kind of assembly line and the judges are not paying
enough attention to individual cases, because they can't,'' said
Thomas Baker, a professor at Drake University Law School in Des
Moines, Iowa, who has written extensively about the appeals courts.
</P>
<P>
   With the Supreme Court giving full review to no more than 200
cases a year and the highest courts of many states also limited in
the number of cases they can hear, some legal scholars say, the
increasing use of abbreviated review procedures by intermediate
appeals courts means litigants are quickly losing the right to
meaningful appeals.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the abbreviated treatment given to many cases,
some judges and scholars say, is a sharp decline in the number of
decisions that federal appeals courts publish in law books.
Unpublished decisions do not establish precedents.
</P>
<P>
   In studies of unpublished decisions, two law professors, William
Reynolds of the University of Maryland and William Richman of the
University of Toledo, say the rulings are usually so succinct that
it is impossible to discern the facts of a case or the reasons for
the judges' ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Court statistics show that federal appeals courts now publish
only 24 percent of their decisions, down sharply from 54 percent in
1985. ``It is sort of a formula for irresponsibility,'' said
Richard Posner, the chief judge of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Chicago. ``Most judges, myself included, are not nearly
as careful in dealing with unpublished decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some federal appeals judges say many cases are given abbreviated
reviews because they are frivolous. No one, they say, is being
denied careful appellate review.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal courts,'' said Harvie Wilkinson III, the chief
judge of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.,
``have developed sophisticated management techniques that
differentiate between cases that are genuinely difficult and
challenging and those which are straightforward.'' His court had
the highest percentage of unpublished decisions last year, 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new methods of handling appeals are necessary, some judges
acknowledge, because many federal appeals judges have fought
efforts to increase their number. The judges have said the quality
and collegiality of the federal bench would be diluted if too many
new judges were added. The number of judges on the circuit courts
has increased to only 167 from 156 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In the case in Fort Myers, Vicki Lopez-Lukis, a former Lee
County commissioner, was convicted in 1997 of depriving her
constituents of her honest services by taking payments from a
Washington lobbyist, Sylvester Lukis, while considering government
projects he was promoting for clients. At the time, the two were
having an affair. They are now married.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors charged the two with 11 counts each in the
bribery case. Sylvester Lukis was acquitted of all charges, while
Mrs. Lukis was convicted of only one count. The couple contended
that the payments were to help her pay for an apartment the two
shared here and had not influenced her votes.
</P>
<P>
   After a jury convicted Mrs. Lukis of one count and she was
sentenced to serve 27 months in prison, she appealed. On Jan. 27,
the three-judge appeals panel handed down its one-word decision.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lukis' lawyer, Thomas Green, a well-known Washington
defense lawyer, says his client's case shows how unfair the
shortcuts in the courts have become; he raised a series of legal
arguments that he said were far from frivolous. Among other things,
he said that if the appeals panel had issued an opinion defining
``honest services,'' he would have had a better chance of
persuading the Supreme Court to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of that concern, Green has asked the full
12-member 11th Circuit Court to make a rare decision to review the
decision of the three-judge panel in Mrs. Lukis' case and use it to
limit what he says are unfair procedures.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court handles federal appeals from Alabama,
Florida and Georgia. Each of the circuit courts across the country
reviews cases in panels of three judges. Unusual cases are
sometimes reviewed after a three-judge panel decision by all of the
judges on a circuit, typically a dozen or more.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers filed a
brief as a friend of the court, asserting that shortcuts like the
one-word opinions are diminishing the public's confidence in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   The debate in the case shows how the dispute over the
abbreviated appeals proceedings is playing out across the country.
The federal prosecutor in the case, Douglas Molloy, said fuller
review of Mrs. Lukis' appeal would waste the court's time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they issue a one-word opinion,'' Molloy said, ``it's a
way of saying, `You brought an appeal that had absolutely no
merit.'''
</P>
<P>
   For defense lawyers, such succinct rulings are frustrating
because they make it virtually impossible to appeal further. If a
federal appeals court has not even specified its reasons for
upholding a lower court ruling, the chances that the Supreme Court
will consider a case are small.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here, Mrs. Lukis said the one-word opinion left
her wondering whether political influence or bias against her as a
Hispanic woman had played a part in her case. ``They didn't tell me
why they decided what they decided,'' she said. ``I think they owe
me that.''
</P>
<P>
   Terse rulings in criminal cases that are deemed routine often
benefit prosecutors, as courts uphold convictions without having to
state legal reasons. But sometimes it is prosecutors who are put at
a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   When a federal appeals court ruled in 1996 that there were legal
problems with the politically popular conviction of Charles
Keating, the former savings and loan executive convicted of
defrauding customers, the court issued a two-paragraph decision
that did not mention some prosecution arguments.
</P>
<P>
   In their studies of the use of brief circuit court decisions,
Richman and Reynolds have suggested that sketchy rulings may
sometimes be used by judges who want to reach a certain legal
result but are not anxious for their decision to be scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, Reynolds said, the rapid growth of
shortcuts in the appeals courts means that people involved in legal
cases are not getting the attention from federal appeals courts
that most of them expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think if you have an appeal, your lawyer argues
the case and a judge decides,'' he said. ``That's not what we have.
We have a system where there is often no argument, there is no
requirement for a judge to write a decision, and the
decision-making is largely done by people who are not judges.''

A MIDWEST LAB FOR CAMPAIGN REFORM  PLAN TO PUT ROCKIES ON THE
PRIMARIES MAP NEWEST BALLOT BOX: PERSONAL COMPUTER?  (jw) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Probably no state has done more than Minnesota to overhaul its
campaign finance laws. And a major part of the change is the system
the state has set up for holding down campaign giving and spending.
</P>
<P>
   As the federal government does for presidential candidates,
Minnesota helps pay some of the campaign costs of candidates for
state office who agree to limit spending. It partially reimburses
voters who contribute to such candidates. And it allows taxpayers
to check a box on the Minnesota income tax form that authorizes the
state treasurer to send $5 to the party of the taxpayer's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a system we think others should take a look at,'' said
Gary Goldsmith of the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public
Disclosure Board. ``A typical cap would be $24,000 for a
legislative race, with the state putting up perhaps a third of
that. Our campaigns don't cost the absurd hundreds of thousands of
dollars that you see elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The checkoff box also gives parties a good status check each
spring.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this point, only about 650 taxpayers had checked
the Reform Party box. But so far this year, according to the
Minnesota Department of Revenue and the campaign finance board,
more than 4,600 taxpayers have checked that box, a solid indication
that the political upheaval that swept the Reform candidate Jesse
Ventura into the governor's office last fall has plenty of
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, the checkoffs are up slightly, to 4,800 now
compared with 4,200 a year ago. For the Democratic-Farmer-Labor
Party, they have fallen sharply to 5,600, compared with 8,500 a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic-Farmer-Labor leaders insist their
parties are holding their own and are raising ample money through
other means, like direct mail. In fact, these leaders say the
outlook for public financing of Minnesota elections may not be
quite as bright as state officials say, since the number of
taxpayers filling in a checkoff box has slipped to 8.2 percent from
11.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes more than public money to build a political party,''
said Tony Sutton, executive director of the Minnesota Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   PLAN TO PUT ROCKIES ON THE PRIMARIES MAP
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Rocky Mountain states have watched with envy as
others have taken the lead in nominating presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt, a Republican, is making some headway
in changing that.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that the region is among the fastest growing in the
country, Leavitt is pressing for a Rocky Mountain primary early in
the primary season, when most of the action now is. He argues that
if all eight Rocky Mountain states hold their primaries on the same
date, the region will rival the nominating influence of California
or New York or another regional group.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Leavitt signed a bill authorizing the state's
major parties to hold primaries next March 10, and once again urged
other Rockies states to follow.
</P>
<P>
   As he sees it, a March 10 Rocky Mountain primary in 2000 would
make the region the ``linchpin'' between two big batches of
primaries that have deliberately been scheduled to follow closely
the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. The first batch,
set for March 7, includes California and New York; the second, set
for March 14, includes mainly Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven other states that Leavitt wants to hook up with,
Wyoming's Legislature has approved a March 10 primary and similar
bills have a good possibility of passage in Colorado, Idaho and
Montana. Question marks hang over Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico,
where some lawmakers say changing to a common voting date will be
politically disruptive or too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   NEWEST BALLOT BOX: PERSONAL COMPUTER?
</P>
<P>
   Everything else, it seems, is on the Internet. So why not online
voting?
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is looking at the possibility for military
personnel overseas. Florida is pondering the possibilities at home.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes California, home of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The state actually tried computer voting in a recent election,
and next week a study panel of election and technology experts will
take a long look at whether balloting by computer is a way to make
voting easier, thereby slowing, or even reversing, the decline in
turnout in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest questions?
</P>
<P>
   According to the head of the study group, Secretary of State
Bill Jones, security and computer availability loom largest,
especially questions about how to register voters, how to check the
validity of their votes if cast from home or work and how to keep
prying eyes from seeing and identifying votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If security and access can be resolved, then online voting
might be one way to help improve voter participation,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have been talking about experimenting with
computer voting as early as next year. Florida has also been
talking about setting up a test next year.
</P>
<P>
   Many technology experts say a secure computer voting system can
readily be designed. A bigger question, they say, is whether the
public will accept it and whether politicians who prefer to run in
low-turnout elections will go along.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the cyberballoting that California already tried?
</P>
<P>
   When Piedmont, just east of Oakland, held a special election
this month, voters found computerized touch-screens at the polling
places.

COLUMN: THIS CLUB HAS A PREREQUISITE _ LOSS OF A CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAUGERTIES, N.Y. _ One night five years ago, when Gabriel Swart
was 21 and a senior at the State University of New York in Buffalo,
he got into a friend's car. The friend was drunk, but only Gabriel
was killed in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Clark was 26 and driving home when she was hit head on by
a driver with a suspended license. She would have been 33 last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel and Angela have been dead for years, but their parents
still meet once a month to talk about their loss, to comfort one
another and the grieving parents of other children lost to car
accidents, to cancer after years of suffering or to an exploding
aneurysm in the brain. Even years later, they join in groups to
mourn together.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, this should not be surprising. Americans are great
joiners, always have been. They join associations based on cars or
the Irish county where some ancestor was born; they join bowling
leagues and neighborhood committees. But what comfort can a group
of strangers offer a parent in the howling agony of a lost son or
daughter? Isn't grief at that level too deep to share beyond the
circle of family and old friends?
</P>
<P>
   For Gabriel's parents, Richard and Nina Swart, and for Angela's,
Ed and Mary Lou Clark, the answer is that those of us who stand
outside the circle of loss are the strangers, and that other bereft
parents are a new kind of family.
</P>
<P>
   In the company of sorrow, the Clarks and the Swarts first
received and then, years later, began to dispense the answers to
the questions each parent who has lost a child asks: When will I
get better? When will I start to live again? Am I going crazy?
</P>
<P>
   The name of their organization is the Compassionate Friends _
``the club nobody wants to be eligible for,'' Swart said with
bitter humor. And far from being a refuge for only a handful, it
has dozens of chapters around the country and all the trappings of
American organizational efficiency: Web sites, videos, brochures,
telephone trees.
</P>
<P>
   The Swarts and the Clarks belong to the Mid-Hudson Valley
Chapter, whose members live in small towns connected by the winding
Catskill roads that have claimed many of their children. Ulster
County has less than half the population of Staten Island in New
York City but recorded the same number of traffic deaths in 1997:
14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going to the Albany meeting for the first time and
seeing 50 people and thinking, `God, there are so many of our
children dying,''' said Mrs. Clark, who runs a housecleaning
service. ``And then when we formed the circle and we each started
telling our stories, I realized how much we all had in common.''
</P>
<P>
   But suppose, these parents were asked, that a rude person who
stood outside the circle of loss were to say, ``Hey, I know it was
terrible but this was years ago _ get over it, focus on the kids
you still have, get on with your life.'' What would they say?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea,'' replied Mrs. Swart, operator of a day-care
center. ``You would not even get close to knowing what it is
like.''
</P>
<P>
   The distance between the bereft and everyone else can be so
great that the Swarts and the Clarks have had to reorder their very
understanding of friendship. ``Some old friends are confused by
what happened and you see them cut across the street to avoid us,''
Swart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We become toxic,'' said his wife. ``But then there are others
who you wouldn't expect too much from, yet who step up and help you
in the most wonderful way,'' Swart added.
</P>
<P>
   So in the comfort of their circle, the Compassionate Friends
discuss coping strategies. Clark, a retired military man, likes
nature and long walks, while his wife is likely to zone out in
front of the television. They talk about what to avoid in the
media: the TV show ``E.R.''; the Robin Williams movie ``What Dreams
May Come,'' for its depiction of suicides damned to hell; anything
in the oeuvre of Stephen King.
</P>
<P>
   They discuss the problem of family videos. Some people watch
movies of their lost children over and over, but Clark isn't yet
ready to see Angela on old tapes. Mrs. Swart recently started
taking out old pictures of Gabriel, but Swart doesn't want to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' he said.

U.S. GENERAL RECOMMENDS PULLOUT FROM HAITI 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The commander of U.S. forces in Latin America and
the Caribbean has recommended the withdrawal of American troops
from Haiti, saying the country's increasing political turbulence is
placing them in danger.
</P>
<P>
   In closed-door testimony last month to a defense subcommittee of
the House Appropriations Committee, Gen. Charles Wilhelm, head of
the Southern Command, said that the deployment of 500 U.S. troops
should be ``terminated'' and replaced by periodic visits by U.S.
military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm's comments were reported Saturday in The Washington
Post. A senior aide to the general, who confirmed the report, said
that should the Clinton administration decide to continue the U.S.
presence in Haiti, Wilhelm would follow orders to the best of his
ability.
</P>
<P>
   The general ``was asked his opinion from a military standpoint
and he gave his opinion,'' said Col. Vince Ogilvie, head of public
affairs for the Southern Command. Ogilvie said that Wilhelm did not
in any way ``try to give the impression that he cannot or will not
comply with the orders that he is given.''
</P>
<P>
   The Haiti mission began in 1994 when 20,000 U.S. troops invaded
the island to restore the democratically elected government of
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide, a popular Roman Catholic priest, had been overthrown
by the country's military leaders in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Having placed Aristide back in power, U.S. troops gradually
dwindled in number to the present force of about 500, who are
involved in tasks like digging wells, providing medical services
and training police and military officers.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration had hoped that the governments of
Aristide and his successor, Rene Preval, would lead to stability in
Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest country, that has not been
the case. Preval last month dissolved Parliament and has been
ruling by decree.
</P>
<P>
   Economic conditions have yet to markedly improve, and Haitian
refugees have once again begun undertaking the risky journey in
leaky boats to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm reportedly told the subcommittee that given the
country's deteriorating economic and political climate, he thought
that his troops would be placed at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The administration evaluates the Haiti mission periodically.
``We constantly review our troop presence in Haiti,'' David Leavy,
spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday. ``The
president is committed to reduce and eventually withdraw our forces
there. We have not made any final decisions and we continue to be
committed to Haiti's democratic transition.''

BOMB IN KOSOVO MARKET KILLS 5 AS LEADERS LEAVE FOR PARIS TALKS

<P>
   MITROVICA, Serbia _ Three powerful bombs exploded Saturday in
northern Kosovo, tearing into people on a market day, killing at
least five people and wounding dozens just as leaders of the
province's ethnic Albanian majority departed for Paris peace talks
with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The dead included two children. More than 60 people were
injured, some seriously, when two bombs detonated within half an
hour of each other in the town of Podujevo, and another exploded an
hour later in the nearby town of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs mark an escalation in the conflict in Kosovo, where
the worst city violence to date in a yearlong war has been drive-by
shootings or grenades thrown into cafes. Saturday's bombs, placed
in public places at the busiest time, were apparently designed for
an effect of maximum terror.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after the explosion in Mitrovica, the bodies of two
women and a 3-year-old child, still lay amid bloody debris of
smashed market stalls, broken eggs, crushed lettuce and spilt
apples and oranges. Blood marked the pavement where people had
dragged the wounded to cars. A 12-inch bomb crater gaped in the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb went off just after 2 p.m. local time, witnesses said.
Agim, an 18-year-old cigarette seller who gave only his first name,
was just 20 paces away, across the road, when the bomb went off.
``I was dazed, at a loss. Then I saw an old man with a wounded leg.
Then I went closer to help and saw that poor woman and her child
next to her. There was another 5-year-old child still moving. I
took him and gave him to a man to take to hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Agim said people ran, screaming and crying, afraid there was
another bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Police cordoned off the area and chalked round spots on the
ground scattered with shrapnel. A foreigner assisting in the
investigation said the bomb seemed to have been placed in a thick
metallic envelope and possibly placed on the ground under a set of
metal weighing scales.
</P>
<P>
   The metallic envelope sent lethal shreds of hot metal into the
crowd, explaining the high level of casualties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitrovica bomb killed three people and wounded 42, said
Mijat Bojovic, the investigating judge in Mitrovica. Ambulances and
military helicopters marked with a red cross were in operation
between Mitrovica and Pristina, Kosovo's capital, all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In Podujevo, a bomb was placed in a garbage can near the market
and another bomb was hurled at the post office. Two people died and
21 were wounded in those blasts.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for the bombs and police
declined to speculate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Market sellers and shopkeepers, mostly Albanian, in Mitrovica
were unanimous in their accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who else but the Serbs?'' said Faik, a young man working in a
bakery across from Mitrovica market. ``Their target in most cases
is women and children. They have their reasons to kill a bit, scare
us a bit, to make us think of leaving and make us stay at home from
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Miki Mahajlovic of the Serb Media Center in Pristina blamed the
bombing on ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' of the Kosovo Liberation
Army who he said wanted to wreck the peace process. ``It is a very
effective method to create fear among the people,'' he said.  &QL;

VATICAN FAVORS MERCY FOR TURK WHO SHOT POPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The Vatican has let the Italian government know that it
would favor clemency for Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman who
tried to assassinate the pope in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Agca, who is serving a life sentence in an Italian prison in
Ancona, has repeatedly asked the pope and the Italian government
for release or extradition to Turkey. The pope forgave Agca for the
attempt on his life, but the Vatican has always emphasized that any
decision about his sentence is up to the Italian government.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night President Luigi Scalfaro told reporters that
he might agree to allow Agca to return to Turkey. ``Since so many
years have passed,'' he said, ``I don't think it would be a
difficult case.''
</P>
<P>
   Agca has said that if he cannot be freed, he would prefer to go
home to Turkey, where he faces a 10-year sentence for the murder of
a Turkish journalist. In an open letter to the pope last month, he
asked the pope to intervene on his behalf. Scalfaro said Saturday
night he had not received an appeal for clemency from the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Agca's lawyer, Marina Magistrelli, said Saturday night that the
Italian Justice Ministry had been considering Agca's request since
September, and contacted the Vatican through diplomatic channels
later last year, seeking its views. The Vatican, also working
through diplomatic channels, told the Justice Ministry at that time
that it would view such a granting of clemency ``favorably.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Vals said he could not
comment on the status of Agca's case or Italy's judicial process.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, the holy father stated that he
forgave Agca; he said it for the first time three days after the
attempt when he was in the hospital, and he has repeated it,''
Navarro-Vals said Saturday night.

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Of the 12 people charged in a sampling
of recent alien-smuggling cases, only eight were sentenced to time
in prison. The average sentence was just 26 months. Here are seven
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants: Abel Morejon, 38, and Nicandro Morejon Mayonada, 39.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations: The Morejon brothers rented a 23-ft powerboat on
March 9 from Club Nautico in Miami. The next day they motored to
Bimini, where they met with 14 Cubans who agreed to pay $1,500 each
to be smuggled into Florida. On March 12, the U.S. Coast Guard
received a distress call from Nicandro, who said their boat was
sinking three miles offshore of Miami Beach. Rescuers found the
boat overturned in 6-9 ft. seas. Aurelio Sanchez, his wife and
3-year-old daughter drowned.
</P>
<P>
   In court: Abel Morejon was sentenced on Feb. 18 to 46 months in
prison. His brother, deemed to have a lesser role in the incident,
was sentenced to 37 months. The brothers interrupted their trial in
November to plead guilty to 14 felony counts of smuggling
conspiracy. Prosecutors decided against pursuing the death penalty
because of the brother's attempts to rescue their passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants: Richard, 41, and Yvonne, 39, Mulligan, Rolando
Barcelo, 26, Gregorio Nelson Cabrera, 43, and Dien Rodriguez, 27.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations: In March 1998, Richard Mulligan escorted 14
Ecuadorians on a flight from their homeland to Santo Domingo, the
Dominican Republic. They had paid him fees ranging from $5,000 to
$7,500 to be smuggled into the United States. The Ecuadorians were
then taken to the Bahamas. On May 12, Yvonne Mulligan and Rodriguez
gathered the Ecuadorians in Freeport, where Cabrera arrived in a
25-foot powerboat. Cabrera was to be paid $10,000 by Yvonne
Mulligan for his role in the smuggling operation. The powerboat
unloaded the aliens ashore at Palm Beach, where they were met by
Barcelo, who was to take them to his home in Miami. Local police
apprehended Barcelo and the aliens.
</P>
<P>
   In court: Barcelo, Cabrera and Rodriguez cooperated with
investigators in return for light sentences. Barcelo was sentenced
to five years probation (6 months confined in his residence).
Cabrera and Rodriguez were sentenced to one year and one day in
prison. The Mulligans pleaded guilty on Dec. 18 to one count of
alien smuggling and were sentenced to three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Defendant: William B. Pace, 53, South Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations: On July 26, U.S. Customs stopped the sailboat Lucky
Lady about 2 miles outside Lake Worth Inlet. The vessel wasn't
flying a yellow quarantine flag as required when arriving from a
foreign country. William Pace, the captain, told Customs officers
he was traveling from Fort Lauderdale to West Palm Beach. Customs
officers found 25 Indian nationals hidden below deck. They also
found $20,600 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   In court: Pace pleaded guilty to alien smuggling and was
sentenced Jan. 14 to 26 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Defendant: David Irvine, 53, Pompano Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations: Miami immigration officials received a tip on Oct.
21, 1996, that a vessel left Freeport, Bahamas, with four Chinese
national aboard. U.S. Customs agents boarded Irvine's boat just
outside the Hillsboro Inlet and found the aliens hiding under a
tarp at the forward area of the boat. The Chinese said they had
paid as much as $35,000 each to be smuggled into the United States
via a route that took them through Europe, South America, Cuba and
the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   In court: Irvine pleaded guilty on Jan. 23, 1997, to one count
of smuggling aliens. He was sentenced to five years of probation.
Computer records show he also had been convicted of alien smuggling
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Defendant: Charles Christopher Pratt, 33, Freeport, Bahamas
</P>
<P>
   Allegations: On April 14, Pratt smuggled 12 Indian nationals
into the country through the Riviera Beach Marina.
</P>
<P>
   In court: Pratt pleaded guilty to 13 counts of alien smuggling.
He argued that he worked ``freelance'' for a larger smuggling ring.
He was sentenced on Sept. 8 to one year and one day in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Defendant: Mark Caranci, 43, Boca Raton
</P>
<P>
   Allegations: A Pompano Beach police officer spotted Caranci
piloting his 23-foot boat toward the Hillsboro Inlet on Oct. 23,
1996. Two Chinese women sat near him in the boat. The sighting
peaked the officer's interest because he had stopped a boat
carrying Chinese illegal aliens the previous day in the same
location. Caranci told investigators he had picked up four Chinese
people in a raft at sea. But his passengers told investigators they
had paid roughly $10,000 each to be smuggled into the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   In Court: Caranci pleaded to one count of alien smuggling and
was sentenced on July 14, 1997, to six months of home confinement
and three years probation.
</P>
<P>
   Defendant: Delroy Denton Carter, 33, Jamaica
</P>
<P>
   Allegations: Carter arrived at Miami International Airport on
Nov. 11, 1996, on an American Airlines flight from Kinston,
Jamaica. He was accompanined by a woman and two children. INS
inspectors noticed that the group's passports appeared to have been
altered. Upon questioning, Monica Green said she had paid $10,000
in Jamiacan currency and another $10,000 to be smuggled into the
U.S. with her two children. Carter then told investigators that he
was working as a middle man for a smuggling operation.
</P>
<P>
   In Court: Carter was sentenced to six months in prison on Feb.
21, 1997, after pleading guilty to alien smuggling and illegally
re-entering the country after being deported.

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
announced last November that government agents had crushed a
massive alien smuggling ring, immigration officials in Miami
watched on closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   They watched a U.S. Border Patrol agent _ in Dallas _ provide
details of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   They watched a U.S. attorney _ in Dallas _ expound upon the
criminal charges he would argue in prosecuting the case.
</P>
<P>
   And what they heard was the story of a smuggling cartel that had
funneled its human cargo into the country for several years through
their back yard _ Miami and points along South Florida's coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials watching the news conference in Miami
could add little to the story. They played only supporting roles in
the bust.
</P>
<P>
   What was called the most sophisticated immigrant-smuggling
operation in the nation's history had operated under their noses
and delivered as many as 300 Indian nationals per month into
Florida. These were not Cubans, Haitians or Central Americans who
might easily blend into South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In battling the smugglers, the U.S. Border Patrol shoulders a
logistical disadvantage in Florida: the number of agents here
hasn't increased in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of agents nationwide has more than doubled
during the past five years to nearly 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep asking,'' said Billy G. Kring, who retired as the
sector's chief in December, ``but we never get any agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the new agents are dispatched along the Mexican
border, where the Immigration and Naturalization Service says
they're needed most.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, about 12,000 people illegally enter Florida from
the sea each year, Kring estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We catch maybe 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sheehey, acting Border Patrol chief in Miami, inherits
the decade-old task of deploying about 60 agents over a territory
that encompasses Florida, Georgia and the two Carolinas. Manpower
is spread thin.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the agency improvises.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Parai'so (Paradise) exemplified the slight-of-hand
strategy. It began June 1 as an attempt to stop smugglers who were
dropping off Cubans on the 110 miles of beaches along the Florida
Keys. It succeeded largely because of perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word was out that we had 200 men'' patroling the Keys, Kring
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the operation numbered three agents working out of a
Tavernier condo. They cruised the marinas, boat landings and
highways. To residents unaccustomed to seeing such patrols, the
Keys seemed to be crawling with agents. No agents are stationed
there on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   The summer-long operation, which cost only $48,000, was designed
to force smugglers to head north to Dade, Broward and Palm Beach
counties, where beachfronts are lined with homes and condominiums.
The Border Patrol relies on the beach communities and their police
to sound the alarm when boatloads of migrants arrive.
</P>
<P>
   An even more valuable ally is the U.S. Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without their presence, I don't think there would be a square
foot of beach without somebody on it arriving from another
country,'' Kring said.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day, the Coast Guard deploys at least two 110-foot
patrol boats in the Florida Straits and aircraft above, said Lt.
Commander Mark Woodring of the Miami Coast Guard District. About 6
percent of the Coast Guard budget, or $177 million, is spent on
intercepting migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the vessels stopped last year _ 102 of them _ carried
Cubans. By comparison, patrol boats intercepted 14 vessels
transporting Dominicans and 11 with Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   INS estimates at least 350,000 illegal immigrants live in
Florida, and the number sneaking ashore surged last year. More and
more of them paid smugglers to help them.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason. Smugglers generally have powerful boats
that can evade the Coast Guard. They also carry cell phones and
global positioning satellite devices to deliver passengers to
specific locations where get-away vehicles await them. Some have
even called from off-shore to summon taxis.
</P>
<P>
   Freezing the numbers of agents in Florida for a decade yielded a
predictable result: agents nab about the same number of smugglers
each year.
</P>
<P>
   During the past five years, agents referred an average of 28
cases of smuggling or harboring illegal aliens to prosecutors in
South Florida annually, according to Justice Department records
compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at
Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   A small cadre within the Border Patrol and the INS investigates
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol in Miami has eight agents in its
anti-smuggling unit for the four states it covers. They spend about
$1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   INS in Miami also has a tiny anti-smuggling unit, which
concentrates on illegal entry through ports and airports.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Washington acknowledges the manpower problem. For
example, INS officials last year singled out Miami International
Airport in a budget report. The agency called for the hiring of 281
new inspectors for airports across the nation. Additional
inspectors would ``ensure full staffing'' at Miami, they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Local INS officials declined to say whether more inspectors at
the airport could have uncovered the massive smuggling operation of
Indian nationals that ended with the bust last November.
</P>
<P>
   Seafaring smugglers, such as those who made last weekend's
disastrous crossing that claimed the lives of at least 15 Haitians,
make headlines and TV soundbites. But most people smuggled into
Florida travel in vans, buses and trucks across the northern
border, Border Patrol officials explain. Smugglers deliver them to
jobs in the citrus groves and vegetable fields.
</P>
<P>
   About 125,000 migrant workers spill into farms in an
eight-county region covered by the Border Patrol station in West
Palm Beach. About 80 percent of the workers illegally entered the
country, estimates Art Bullock, agent in charge of the office.
</P>
<P>
   Field hands from Central America arrive each growing season. The
Border Patrol started Operation One-Way about three years ago after
discovering that smugglers used trucks and vans rented for a
one-way trip to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``This office probably devotes 70 percent of its time to alien
smuggling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing smugglers falls to the five agents and two
investigators assigned to the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This station would probably need 40 to 60 new men to do it
right,'' Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   Growers don't hire workers directly. They get them through the
4,500 licensed labor contractors who operate in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Unscrupulous contractors hire workers smuggled here through
networks operating in Texas, Arizona and other border states. About
1,000 workers are smuggled across Florida's northern border each
week during the growing season, agents estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for migrant workers blame the INS and Border Patrol
for the large number of undocumented field hands in the state. They
complain that INS inspections occur only at the end of the growing
season, allowing farm owners to reap the benefit of the cheap
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Chief Sheehey says it's a misconception that the Border
Patrol looks the other way. It's just that his office's budget
isn't approved by Washington until the busiest time of the year for
growers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the agency cannot enforce the law because it
runs out of money.
</P>
<P>
   Once the agency's budget is approved, it focuses on its most
pressing cases. Undocumented farm workers might not be high on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the backlog is overwhelming. Agents have been known to
work 12-hour shifts at stretches of six days a week. Those assigned
to the West Palm Beach station are virtually always on call.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington's eyes, the cash and manpower dedicated to
fighting migrant smuggling in Florida is measured in the context of
national priorities. And South Florida's migrant smuggling problem
isn't a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question that the Miami district doesn't have the resources
it needs,'' said Russell Bergeron, an INS spokesman in Washington.
``But you must put your resources where the most serious problem
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, planners developed a strategy in 1993 to
concentrate attention on the nation's southwest border. About 90
percent of all illegal entries occur there.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress gave the INS $125 million to hire 1,000 new
Border Patrol agents. Nearly all of them were to be assigned to
California, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The INS also initiated Operation Global Reach in June 1997 to
prod other countries to crack down on smugglers. INS officers were
sent to 13 foreign cities to promote cooperation and encourage them
to identify and prosecute smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   The list of cities included five in Central and South America,
as well as Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and Kingston, Jamaica. However,
the program neglected to include any Bahamian cities, which serve
as safe havens for migrant smugglers. West End, in the Bahamas, was
the departure point for the Haitians who drowned last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1997, the INS announced it would create a list of the 10
most wanted alien smugglers. But the list was never developed, an
INS spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, then Gov. Lawton Chiles met with state and federal
officials to encourage them to share intelligence and resources to
combat smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't announce any new programs. And he said he
anticipated no increases in cash or manpower.
</P>
<P>
   His successor echoed the cry for more federal help after last
week's drownings. Gov. Jeb Bush also suggested that the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement get involved in smuggling
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Washington does plan to beef up the Border Patrol once again.
The agency expects to hire another 1,000 agents in fiscal year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, none are scheduled to come to Florida.

<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ On this night, the huddled masses are wet
and tired, sitting along the curb fronting the lobby of the Golden
Sands hotel.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Border Patrol convoy of two vans and a patrol car
squeezes into the scene, which is already thick with onlookers and
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Belotti approaches a cluster of paramedics and asks for a
head count.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this shuts us down for the rest of the night,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Belotti, 33, works the graveyard shift at the Border Patrol
station in Pembroke Pines. He knows that red-tape chore of formally
charging 26 Cubans with illegally entering the country will consume
the rest of his shift _ about six more hours. The station will
virtually shut down while the new arrivals are processed and bused
to Krome Detention Center.
</P>
<P>
   And while Belotti wrestles with paperwork, the Florida coastline
loses its border sentry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, I'm the only Border Patrol agent working this
shift between Corpus Christie, Texas, and Swanton, Vermont,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, two other agents are also assigned to the midnight
shift. But vacations, illness and staggered schedules sometimes
leave the station with just one man.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular night, three agents who went off-duty at
midnight agree to work a double shift to help Belotti. They hunch
over computer screens, filling in electronic forms. They glance now
and then into the sleepy faces of men, women and children to pose
questions and snap Polaroids.
</P>
<P>
   What is your daughter's name?
</P>
<P>
   How were you employed in your hometown?
</P>
<P>
   Whom did you pay to bring you here?
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, a story unfolds. The group, mostly from the city of
Pinar del Rio, left Cuba at about 3 p.m. aboard a 28-foot red and
white fishing boat. Everyone claims to have paid 10,000 Cuban pesos
(about $450) for the trip. A man called ``Pipo'' operated the boat.
The seas were rough. Several people became seasick. When the glow
of hotel lights grew bright, they slipped over the side and Pipo
sped away.
</P>
<P>
   The story is familiar to Belotti, who transferred six months ago
to the Miami sector from a Border Patrol outpost in Nogales, Ariz.
So familiar that he doesn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a lot of staged landings,'' he says. ``I'm
talking about people who wade out into the surf here and then turn
themselves in as illegal aliens when they really came ashore in the
Keys a week ago and already spent time with their families who live
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Staged landings buy time for the smuggler's get-away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people we picked up tonight probably walked along the
beach for a couple of hours before they went up to the hotel and
asked for help,'' he says. Sometimes refugees buy cheap, rickety
boats in Cuba and pay smugglers to tow them to the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   Alien smuggling is growing, Border Patrol agents say. Virtually
no one risks the dangerous crossing on rafts or makeshift boats.
Many of the new arrivals are relatives of Cubans who came to the
United States in 1994 in large numbers. Their smuggling fees, which
can run as high as $8,000, sometimes are paid by family members
already living here, agents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you notice that the mother of one of the women we loaded
into our vans tonight was in the crowd to welcome her?'' Belotti
asks.
</P>
<P>
   Only those Cubans intercepted at sea are turned away. Those who
make landfall are entitled to stay in the country under provisions
of the Cuban Readjustment Act. The Border Patrol deals almost
exclusively with the ones with sand on their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we do here. We process these people so they can
start their lives in the United States,'' Belotti quips.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't like that in Nogales, he says. Mexicans caught
entering the U.S. were taken back. And during his six years in that
border town, he never encountered crowds of cheering onlookers,
such as this night when shouts of Libertad! greeted the new
arrivals as they climbed aboard the Border Patrol vans.
</P>
<P>
   When he isn't dealing with smuggled aliens, Belotti patrols the
border _ though it seems like a futile exercise. His beat covers
the coast from the Palm Beach-Broward county line down to Key West
and up to Naples on the Gulf. He stops at area marinas and passes
out leaflets warning boaters about the penalties for transporting
aliens. He also keeps an eye out for anything unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch for the guys with 17 life preservers in their boat or
the guys going fishing without any fishing poles,'' he explains.
``We're hoping to deter amateurs from getting into the smuggling
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Amateurs are more likely to spawn a tragedy, he says. Their
inexperience and greed prompt them to overload boats or attempt
treacherous seas. In December, 14 people drowned when a 29-foot
Scarab capsized a few miles from the coast; 21 people were aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Belotti says the station also works Operation Child Care, in
which agents use computer databases to identify migrants arrested
for sex crimes against children. Agents have been rounding them up
for deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But right now that's on hold because of the influx of Cuban
smugglings,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen agents and supervisors work the Pembroke Pines station
now. When Belotti transferred here, he noticed a plaque commending
the station _ 24 agents were listed.
</P>
<P>
   It's 3:50 a.m. and the sporadic clatter of computer keyboards
stops. Belotti and the three agents working overtime have processed
21 of the illegal migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, sleeping women and children sprawl across the concrete
floor of a windowless holding cell. The cell door is open and a
small floor fan circulates the air. The men occupy an adjacent cell
behind a locked steel door. A light switch outside the cell oddly
controls both the lights and air conditioning inside. The men
choose pitch darkness after their cell turns refrigerator cold.
</P>
<P>
   Belotti heads for the lunchroom to see if anything's left in the
coffee pot.
</P>
<P>
   A computer flickers and a screen saver scrolls: ``The Madness
has to stop. Make Cuba the 51st state.''

 &HT;    COX SMUGGLING SERIES: SMUGGLERS ESCAPE TOUGH COURT CASES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's a crime with built-in deniablity.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it plays out: A U.S. Coast Guard patrol stops a
high-speed boat off the Florida Keys. They find a dozen Cuban
passengers aboard. The boat's captain explains that he happened to
be fishing when he spotted the Cubans struggling in a sinking raft.
Though the passengers show no signs of fatigue, dehydration or
injury, they confirm the story and insist that the captain be
treated as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Alien smuggling cases are difficult to prosecute because often
the only witness to the crime is the smuggled human cargo. And
people who spend their life savings in a desperate bid to get into
the United States make reluctant witnesses, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of building a case becomes particularly acute when
it involves Cubans, said one Justice Department source who traded
his candid remarks for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're dealing with a Cuban boat captain and Cuban
passengers, invariably, everyone denies that smuggling is taking
place,'' he said. ``It's always a rescue at sea.''
</P>
<P>
   The business of immigrant smuggling prospers. Demand is high.
Cuban, Haitian and other economic and political refugees eagerly
hire entrepreneurs with fast boats capable of dodging Coast Guard
patrols. The risks of capture and punishment are low. The Border
Patrol in Florida hasn't seen an increase in manpower in 10 years.
Convicted smugglers seldom spend much time in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Built-in deniability is one reason South Florida's federal
prosecutors historically have been reluctant to drag suspected
smugglers into court. They filed only 101 cases of smuggling or
harboring illegal aliens during a five-year period ending September
1998, according to Justice Department records. They declined to
prosecute another 47 cases referred to them by immigration and
other law enforcement officials during that period.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Thomas Scott, who assumed office in mid-1997,
declined to discuss the past performance of federal prosecutors in
South Florida. His policy is to aggressively prosecute smugglers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His prosecutors filed 21 alien smuggling cases in the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen prosecutors are available for smuggling cases, said John
Schlesinger, Scott's special counsel. The office also acquired
three attorneys on loan from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to help deal with immigration cases. At this point,
however, there are no plans to create a special smuggling unit as
there are for drugs and white collar crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Williams, the federal public defender in Miami, said
she hasn't noticed a sharp increase in smuggling cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly has been an appreciable increase in the number
of press conferences on the subject,'' she said. ``It could be
they're being more aggressive or it could be they're making a lot
of noise about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams suggested to Scott that federal prosecutors and public
defenders work together to expedite smuggling cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rebuffed,'' she said. ``I was told they didn't have
enough cases to warrant that.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, smugglers faced little or no prison time if
caught. Prosecutors suffered a frustrating irony: on average, they
spent more time preparing a case _ roughly six months _ than the
smuggler spent in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, punishment was light even when smuggled people
died. For example, last year three Cubans drowned during a
smuggling trip. Two brothers pleaded guilty and were sentenced to
fewer than four years in prison. In 1994, four Haitians, two adults
and two children, drowned off Jensen Beach in a smuggling attempt.
The boat's captain was sentenced to fewer than four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, the penalty for getting caught smuggling aliens
is just not the same as for someone caught carrying a load of
drugs,'' said Mark Briesemeister, who supervises an anti-smuggling
unit for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami. ``To
the smuggler, the risks are minimal and the profit potential is
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress upped the stakes two years ago when it toughened the
penalties for the crime. The maximum penalty for alien smuggling
doubled to 10 years. Federal judges must sentence smugglers to a
minimum of three years now if prosecutors prove the crime was
committed for profit. And prosecutors can now seek the death
penalty for smugglers who cause deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban smugglers have operated with near impunity. For years,
federal prosecutors hesitated to take smuggling cases to trial in
Miami, where juries could easily include exiles and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Post examined the cases of 21 defendants who
pleaded guilty to smuggling aliens and four who were convicted
during 1996 and 1997. None involved Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   That's beginning to change. In 1998 South Florida prosecutors
filed alien smuggling charges in six incidents involving Cubans.
Nine Cubans were charged.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants drowned in two of those episodes. In the most
dramatic, a boat packed with 23 Cubans capsized on Dec. 17 south of
Miami. Officials believe 14 people drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Such tragedies are altering South Florida's attitudes toward
smugglers, the U.S. attorney said. The Cuban community now supports
a crackdown, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they recognize that many of these cases are strictly
about money and may involve death,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors secure guilty pleas or verdicts in more than
80 percent of the smuggling cases in South Florida, according to
Justice Department records. Prosecutors in the Southwest boast the
same success rate.
</P>
<P>
   However, South Florida prosecutors historically have dropped the
charges in smuggling cases more often than their colleagues in the
Southwest _ and prosecutors there handle far more cases.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida prosecutors declined 48.8 percent of the smuggling
cases referred to them by law enforcement during a five-year period
ending Sept. 30, 1997. Prosecutors in Arizona declined 6.4 percent
during that period. Prosecutors in South Texas and Southern
California dropped only 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Regional comparisons are misleading, cautions Assistant U.S.
Attorney John Schlesinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no plausible deniability in the Southwest,'' he said.
``For example, if the Border Patrol stops a car crossing the
Mexican border and finds a few aliens in the trunk, what can the
driver say?''
</P>
<P>
   Weak evidence prompted prosecutors in South Florida to drop 16
smuggling cases during the five-year period examined by The Post.
They declined to prosecute 18 others because of a ``lack of
investigative or prosecutorial resources,'' according to Justice
Department records.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to prosecute cases that rely on the testimony of
smuggled migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators often must decide at sea whether to hold smuggled
aliens as witnesses or send them back to their homeland.
Repatriation usually means forfeiting their testimony, though
prosecutors have in rare instances taken depositions on foreign
soil. However, that approach raises a Sixth Amendment issue of the
accused smuggler's right to confront all witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   A boatload of Cubans interdicted at sea might be eager to be
brought to shore to testify in a smuggling case. Once in the
country, the Cuban Refugee Readjustment Act kicks in, allowing them
to remain in the country and become eligible for citizenship after
five years. In effect, prosecutors who bring witnesses ashore are
finishing the smuggler's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing Cuban aliens into Miami to be witnesses is shooting
the anti-smuggling effort in the foot,'' said a Justice Department
source.
</P>
<P>
   Also, defense attorneys are quick to attack the credibility of
migrant witnesses. They trade their testimony for promises of work
permits and citizenship, attorneys argue.
</P>
<P>
   Often, smuggled individuals refuse to become witnesses. Two
Bahamian men suspected of smuggling 15 Haitians into Broward County
were deported to Freeport in January after Border Patrol agents
failed to persuade any of the refugees to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that 80 percent of people don't want to cooperate,''
said Steve Quinones, head of the Border Patrol's anti-smuggling
unit in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Without believeable witnesses, prosecutors usually must rely on
circumstantial evidence. They cite the cash, cell phone numbers and
the boat's high-tech navigational gear that pinpoints the migrants'
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Most smuggling convictions are open-and-shut cases: a rental van
packed with Mexicans stopped on Interstate 95, Ecuadorans arriving
at Miami International Airport with fake passports, Dominicans
stowed away in a cruise ship cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors convicted 61 people of smuggling or harboring aliens
during the five-year period ending in September 1997. Most were
guilty pleas.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those smugglers didn't go to prison. About one in
four was sentenced to prison during that period.
</P>
<P>
   Courts in the Southwest seem tougher. Judges in Arizona
sentenced 30.5 percent to prison. Southern California judges sent
45 percent to prison and South Texas judges imprisoned slightly
more than half.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were sentenced to prison haven't done much time. The
median prison term in 1997, what the majority of smugglers
convicted in South Florida faced, was five months.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have managed to send smugglers away for longer
prison terms by charging them with other crimes. For example, if a
deported smuggler comes back to the United States, just walking the
streets is evidence of a new crime: re-entering the country.
</P>
<P>
   The charge, dubbed ``felony walking,'' is virtually
indefensible.

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The promise of jobs fuels the business
of migrant smuggling, and Florida offers a land of opportunity for
those who sneak across its borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I believe that if you focused on employees and
contractors and take away all sources of employment ... you can
literally turn your back on the borders,'' said Billy Kring, former
chief of the U.S. Border Patrol in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service, which oversees the
Border Patrol, does just the opposite. It focuses on border
security.
</P>
<P>
   An illegal job market flourishes in Florida, prompting growing
numbers of migrants to turn to smugglers. And smugglers operate in
a climate of acceptable risk: a Border Patrol in Florida that
hasn't seen an increase in manpower in 10 years, a Coast Guard
patrolling a region strewn with islands of safe-havens, courts
wrestling with complex immigration law and juries sympathetic
toward refugees.
</P>
<P>
   About 350,000 illegal immigrants live in Florida, according to a
1997 INS estimate.
</P>
<P>
   In the years immediately following Congress' decision in 1986 to
outlaw the hiring of illegal aliens, the Miami INS office opened
hundreds of cases against employers. In 1988, the agency
investigated 711 employers.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, the caseload had dropped dramatically.
Agents were handling fewer than 50 investigations a year. It was
during that period that the Border Patrol was instructed to
concentrate on immigrants, not employers, Kring said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late 1980s we focused on the worksite and it made a
huge difference,'' Kring said. ``We'd go to worksite and maybe 80
percent would be illegals. We'd go back and they'd be a lot less,
and the third time you'd be lucky to find one or two. Now, we just
don't have the manpower to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS in Miami opened 126 cases last year against employers
statewide. Many involve employers' failue to keep decent records
showing whether their workers are here legally.
</P>
<P>
   The agency removed 133 illegal workers from their jobs last year
in South Florida. Offending employers were fined a total of
$28,650.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions work, said Thomas Danter, supervisor of the
investigations unit in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we would remove unauthorized workers and nothing
happened to the employers,'' he said. ``They would just go out and
hire more.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, employers can be fined up to $3,000 per worker and
sentenced to six months in prison. Danter said he's never seen an
employer sentenced to prison in Florida. He's been an agent since
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Local INS officials hesitate to even talk about worksite
inspections. Their reluctance might be traced to an April 23 raid
at a flower wholesaler in West Dade.
</P>
<P>
   A melee erupted while armed agents rounded up 23 workers at
First Paragon Floral. Workers complained that agents pushed them
around, forced them to sit on wet floors, confined them in a cold
storage area and shouted at them to produce their papers. Some
employees insisted they were legal residents or green-card workers
and resisted the agents, prompting a call to Miami-Dade police.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders, including Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex
Penelas, lambasted INS. It turned out that three of the arrested
workers were permanent residents and eight others were eligible for
work permits.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was mentioned in a report issued by the National
Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which accused INS agents
nationwide of using terror tactics. The report, called ``Portrait
of Injustice'' documented abuses in 235 INS raids.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month after the West Dade incident, INS directed its
agents to have a written plan for every ``worksite enforcement''
and to bring a liaison officer with them. The agency also told
inspectors to focus on employers who hire smuggled aliens or abuse
their workers.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what the Miami office is doing, which explains
why investigators have opened only eight cases against employers
since last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do area-control operations,'' which is Danter's way
of saying there are no surprise raids at job sites.
</P>
<P>
   That means INS agents rarely investigate the largest employer of
unauthorized workers _ the state's fruit and vegetable growers.
</P>
<P>
   No farm owner in Florida has been sanctioned for hiring illegal
workers during the past three years, according to data compiled by
the Center for Immigration Studies. Instead, INS has fined
restaurants, landscapers, nurseries and other small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a lead (about a farm employing illegal workers), it
does get investigated,'' Danter said. ``I haven't seen any types of
leads recently come in on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even advocates for the growers say it's no secret
that large numbers of illegal employees are working the fruit and
vegetable fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen estimates as high as 80 percent. There's no question
it's significant,'' said Walter Kates, a labor specialist with the
Florida Fruit &AMP; Vegetable Association in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Growers can do little to weed out unauthorized workers, he
added. Field hands are getting jobs with counterfeit identification
and immigration documents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the law is written, the employer cannot second-guess
or ask for additional documents,'' Kates said. ``That becomes a
form of discrimination and the farmer would be subject to fines.''
</P>
<P>
   Counterfeit alien registration receipt cards, the new version of
what was once called green cards, are widespread, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been the Achilles' heel of verification.''
</P>
<P>
   Danter added that the INS doesn't expect farmers to be able to
spot phony documents. The INS operates a separate unit dedicated to
chasing bogus document-suppliers. In November, the INS raided a
counterfeiting ring in Los Angeles that produced phony documents,
some of which turned up in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Farm worker advocates charge that counterfeit documents offer a
convenient excuse for growers. Growers could check workers' records
electronically through a voluntary INS program being tested in
Florida. But none are participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are powerful interests, fruit and vegetable growers
among them, who want to make sure a system like this is not
implemented nationwide,'' said Mark Krikorian, executive director
of the Center for Immigration Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Growers dodge the verification problem by hiring their field
hands from farm labor contractors, say migrant worker advocates.
Contractors function like independent foremen. Growers pay them to
deliver work crews. The contractor hires pickers, and it's their
responsibility to check each worker's papers.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers expect contractors to follow the law, said Gary Smigiel,
general counsel for Mecca Farms of Lantana. ``We require
contractors to hire legal help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No contractor in Florida has been fined for hiring illegal
workers during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Labor &AMP; Employment Security has no
record of ever revoking or suspending the license of a contractor
for hiring undocumented workers, said an agency spokesman. The
department, which licenses contractors for the federal government,
refers any matters involving illegal workers to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulating contractors has done nothing,'' said attorney
Gregory Schell of the Migrant Farmworkers Justice Project in Belle
Glade.
</P>
<P>
   Farms are the ``sweatshops in the sun,'' he said. Farmers
treasure illegal workers because they don't complain and work for
low wages, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farm hands arrive in Florida owing $800 to $1,200 to smugglers,
Schell said. Their debts often are deducted from their wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smuggling fees take about 50 percent of what's earned, so we
see people crying about not being able to send money home,'' Schell
said.
</P>
<P>
   A contractor in western Palm Beach County, who asked that his
identity be protected, said harvests are done almost exclusively by
illegal workers from Mexico. No one else will accept the jobs, the
contractor said.
</P>
<P>
   Growers also argue that migrant workers are the only people
willing to work the farms. Removing illegal workers would only
create a worker shortage, they say.
</P>
<P>
   However, a 1997 federal report indicated that farmers need not
worry. Less than 5 percent of the INS worksite investigations
involved agriculture. Furthermore, INS officials quoted in the
report said they were ill-equipped to significantly reduce
unauthorized farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hancock, director of the Department of Labor's farmworkers
division in Washington, D.C., sees another force blocking an INS
crackdown on employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to happen because of the politics.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, several congressmen, led by Sen. Paul Coverdell,
R.-Ga., halted a massive INS raid in May on onion farms in Vidalia,
Ga. Farmers bitterly complained that their harvest would be ruined
without the 4,000 to 5,000 Mexicans they hire each year.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented move, INS agreed to look the other way while
scores of illegal workers harvested the onions. In exchange,
farmers agreed to do more to comply with migrant labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   Farms are the entry-level workplaces for many illegal migrants.
From there, they move to poultry farms, restaurants and lumber
yards. Others find jobs in tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see most unauthorized workers in hotels and restaurants,``
said INS investigator Danter.
</P>
<P>
   The state's booming construction industry is another source of
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear from people who can't get jobs because they're being
displaced by illegal workers,'' said Rick Grennier, chief of the
Border Patrol in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Subcontractors who hire illegal workers save money and are able
to underbid competitors, he explained. For example, agents arrested
about 40 illegal workers at Celebration, Disney's upscale housing
development.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress pumped up the INS budget in 1996, it added money
for new worksite inspectors. But it hasn't added money for more
inspectors since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got nothing,'' recalled Russell Bergeron, an INS spokesman
in Washington. ``The critics who complain about the lack of
interior enforcement are the same ones who vote against the
resources to accomplish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the INS seems more vigilant in other states.
</P>
<P>
   During the first nine months of 1997, the INS cited 23 employers
in Florida for hiring illegal aliens, according to the Center for
Immigration Studies. Incomplete 1997 figures were the most recent
data available.
</P>
<P>
   But in the same period, INS sanctioned 89 employers in New York,
57 in Texas, 27 in New Jersey, 28 in Pennsylvania and 30 in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The INS is expected to soon unveil a five-year plan that focuses
on illegal workers, document fraud and smuggling within the United
States, Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is long overdue, say critics. And until it is
implemented, immigrants will continue to pay smugglers to bring
them to the farms, the restuarants, the hotels and construction
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is telling aliens that if they can run the gauntlet,
then they can work here,'' said Krikorian of the Center for
Immigration Studies. ``It's a moral issue. The nation is provoking
illegal immigration, but making that immigration dangerous.''

New York's youngest immigrant workers, their cheap, nimble labor
easily absorbed by the city's thriving service economy. Yet they
are trapped in an underground ruled in large measure by fear _ of
the immigration authorities, child welfare agencies, smugglers,
thugs and bosses, past and potential. And immigration scholars and

PROSECUTORS FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA'S MEXICAN MAFIA, `THE GANG OF
GANGS'

 (ATTN: Calif.)   (SUBS to correct typesetting error in first sentence of graf 16)  
(DW) 
 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As guilty verdicts were read, over and over, in
the racketeering prosecution two years ago of the prison gang known
as la Eme, a pattern emerged: one defendant, Victor Murillo, was
being acquitted of all counts against him. His co-defendants
cheered, and ultimately he was the only one of 13 men on trial to
be set free.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, Murillo's name surfaced again in court papers,
as federal prosecutors filed two new indictments against 27
suspected members of la Eme (so named for the Spanish pronunciation
of the letter M). This time, however, Murillo is making his
appearance as a murder victim.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities here have turned their sights once again on la
Eme, known as the Mexican Mafia, one of California's oldest and
still most powerful prison gangs, charging its members under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act with waging a
brutal campaign for control of Southern California's gangs and drug
trade.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest case, the defendants, said to have stepped in to
fill the power vacuum created by the conviction of Murillo's
confederates, are charged in connection with four murders and 13
conspiracies to commit murder, and face other counts including
attempted murder, assault and drug trafficking. Eleven of the
defendants in the new case were in state prison for previous
convictions when the indictments were unsealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with what we perceive to be significant criminal problems,
we will address them until they are eliminated,'' said Alejandro
Mayorkas, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles. ``Our first prosecutive
effort directed toward the Mexican Mafia had a significant impact
upon the organization. It did not, however, eliminate the criminal
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   La Eme was conceived as a ``gang of gangs'' by inmates from East
Los Angeles at the Deuel Vocational Institution south of Sacramento
in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Membership is for life _ ``blood in, blood out'' the oath goes _
and the penalty for breaking rules is death. Its membership is
almost exclusively Mexican American, drawn from Southern California
gang members who have been incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   As the cases make clear, those often in harm's way from la Eme
are the group's own members. Of 12 murders and attempted murders in
the previous prosecution, five were of ``carnales,'' or brothers.
One suspected member, Mariano Martinez, 41, is listed as a
defendant in one of the new indictments, and as the target of a
murder plot in the other.
</P>
<P>
   While most details of Murillo's death, and life, have remained
closely held by the task force that has spent most of the decade
investigating the Mexican Mafia, his story illustrates how one's
star rises and falls in the gang.
</P>
<P>
   Murillo, 51 at the time of his trial, was said by investigators
to have joined la Eme in the 1970s during a stay in federal prison
for fraud, and to have done brisk business as a supplier of cocaine
and speed.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with two racketeering conspiracy counts in the
1995 case, for being present at surreptitiously videotaped Mexican
Mafia meetings where votes were taken on murder contracts and drug
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   On April 4, 1998, less than a year after his acquittal the
previous May, Murillo was shot to death in a dirt parking lot
outside Visalia, the small farming town where he lived in
California's Central Valley. Speaking on condition of anonymity,
officials have suggested a number of motives for his death,
including his alliance with veteran members of the gang in the face
of a generational rivalry and a refusal to share drug proceeds with
younger members, or possibly retribution for a perception prompted
by his acquittal that he had cooperated with law-enforcement
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Woody, 27, a suspected Mexican Mafia member, is charged
with Murillo's death in the new case. Woody has pleaded not guilty;
his lawyer, William S. Harris, declined to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, la Eme sought to extend its influence beyond
prison walls to the street, organizing street gangs in large public
meetings to declare a ban on drive-by shootings and requiring gangs
to pay ``taxes'' on drug profits. The gangs mostly cooperated for
fear of retribution by la Eme and to protect fellow street gang
members in prison. State corrections officials estimate la Eme's
ranks at up to 700 members, with thousands more on the street eager
to do its bidding for a chance at membership.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors first charged members of the gang in 1995,
hoping to break their power by sprinkling them through the larger
federal prison system.
</P>
<P>
   Although the gang's tax collections continue, probation
officers, police officers and one gang member say the prosecution
has somewhat weakened la Eme and forced members to adopt a lower
profile. But as a result, they say, the old shooting truce that was
once enforced by the Mexican Mafia is in tatters, and 24 people
have been killed on the streets of East Los Angeles in the
resulting gang war over the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gang members sense that no one's going to enforce
violations of the code,'' said a probation officer who would only
speak on the condition of anonymity. ``Who's going to issue
sanctions? So there's a lessening of control over the street gangs.
It's kind of the yin and yang, you get some good and some bad with
it. But if you wait for organized crime to set the standards for
our society, it's pretty sorry indeed.''

THE LUXURY OF DARRYL STRAWBERRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Darryl Strawberry has one hit in six at-bats in
his first two exhibition games, and feels he is slowly regaining
his swing. But there is a thorny issue that eventually must be
hurdled before Strawberry joins the New York Yankees in the regular
season _ an issue that may turn ugly.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the Yankees exercised the $2.5 million option on
Strawberry, they arranged with major-league baseball to keep his
salary from being included in the money subject to luxury tax.
Therefore, the Yankees will be subject to a 33 percent tax on
Strawberry's salary as soon as he's placed on their roster.
</P>
<P>
   When the details of his contract were worked out in January,
they didn't appear to be an obstacle for Strawberry's return. But
in the interim, the Yankees lost two significant arbitration
decisions, $5 million to Derek Jeter and $4.25 million to Mariano
Rivera. Since then, the Yankees have been trying to cut costs in
other ways _ they're exploring possible trades involving reliever
Darren Holmes (two years remaining at $3.25 million), were
conservative in their negotiations with catcher Jorge Posada and
pitcher Ramiro Mendoza, and even reduced the travel time for some
scouts in spring training. George Steinbrenner, the Yankees'
principal owner, is not in a mood to spend money unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's inclusion on the roster is not necessary, for now.
The Yankees have three left fielders in Chad Curtis, Ricky Ledee
and Shane Spencer _ Strawberry probably couldn't play left field
now, anyway, until he rebuilds his leg strength _ and they have a
designated hitter in Chili Davis. Strawberry would be a spare part,
in spite of his strong comeback last season, before he learned of
his colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees may want Strawberry to remain in the minor leagues
and continue his rehabilitation. But Strawberry, who turned 37
Friday, has made it clear he wants to be part of the team on
opening day, and its a goal to him, as he lifts weights and
strengthens his legs. Others in the organization feel Strawberry
won't willingly accept an assignment to the minors for one day
longer than is necessary _ and after exercising the multimillion
option on Strawberry, the Yankees may want him to do what they ask.
</P>
<P>
   Center Field Status
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, assured Curtis that
he is not trying to trade him and currently is not discussing him
as part of any prospective deals. Cashman could change his mind and
swap Curtis and his three-year, $6 million deal at any time, but it
probably isn't likely until the Yankees are confident Ledee could
play center field on a regular basis if Williams is hurt.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ledee's play in center has been good, with some trouble
spots. In one game against Kansas City, Ledee repeatedly positioned
himself very deep in center, and short fly balls dropped in front
of him. Jose Cardenal, the Yankees' coach responsible for
outfielders, was not there that day. But Cardenal intends to always
be with Ledee now. When Ledee plays center field, Cardenal will
follow him and help position him.

   ``He can play there,'' Cardenal said. ``He's got the quickness,
and he gets a good jump on the ball.''
</P>

   Curtis, in any event, is having a strong spring training,
batting .500 and driving the ball to the opposite field, something
he failed to do in the final half of last season.

   Medical Report
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre's condition aside, the Yankees' roster generally
remained in good condition, avoiding injuries. But there are some
nagging problems.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte, the left-hander who strained his elbow in an
exhibition game, will likely attempt to play catch Monday. If
Pettitte can rehabilitate his injury without delay, he should be
ready to be part of the Yankees' rotation by the opening week of
the season. Don Zimmer, who has stepped in as manager in Torre's
absence, said of Pettitte, ``Some days he feels good, some days
he's not so good.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of players are suffering from flu symptoms, including
right fielder Paul O'Neill, who was scratched from the starting
lineup in Friday's exhibition game, and Jerome Walton, the
nonroster invitee who has missed three straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Bernie Williams is recovering from a strained quad
muscle, but his injury is not serious. If this were the regular
season, said one club official, Williams would likely play through
the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Preseason Batting Averages: From .500 to .053
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis leads the Yankees with six runs batted in and a .500
batting average. Chili Davis is hitting .429, Jorge Posada .385 and
Scott Brosius .364. On the flip side, Joe Girardi is batting .154
and Paul O'Neill .053. Orlando Hernandez has allowed seven hits in
seven innings, with one walk and nine strikeouts; Mariano Rivera
has not permitted runs in five and two-thirds innings, but he has
been somewhat erratic, with four walks.

International Olympic commitee listed assets of nearly $100 million

But seven years later, the committee is now estimated to have more
than $200 million in assets. Where does the IOC hoarde its cash and

   MEXICO-BARTLETT _ PUEBLA, Mexico _ Among the many books in the
governor's mansion here, Manuel Bartlett kept a copy of ``The
Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs.'' It was an amusing choice
of reading for a man now struggling to overcome an image as one of
Mexico's own most endangered species. Bartlett -- who wants to be
Mexico's next president -- is one of this country's ``dinosaurs,''
the not-so-affectionate nickname for the old, authoritarian guard
of the Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI, which has
controlled Mexico's presidency for 70 years. A career politician
and recent governor of Puebla state, Bartlett represents the past
to Mexicans who believe he engineered old-fashioned electoral fraud
and other anti-democratic evils. But this shrewd politician claims
he's the PRI's best bet to hang onto the presidency in July 2000,
when Mexicans go to the polls in the most competitive presidential
election in Mexican history. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH

   PALM BEACH SMUGGLING SERIES
</P>
<P>
   EDs: The Palm Beach Post has a three-day package for Saturday,
March 13, Sunday, March 14, and Monday, March 15, on the business
of smuggling aliens; why the U.S. Border Patrol, the INS and the
federal court system cope poorly with it in Florida; and why
Florida employers are able to hire hundreds of thousands of illegal
workers each year. Here are the budget lines for the second day in
the series. STORIES HAVE MOVED. FOUR PHOTOS AND FOUR GRAPHICS ARE
AVAILABLE.
</P>
<P>
   SMUGGLE-MAIN _ WEST PALM, BEACH, Fla. _ Smuggling immigrants
into Florida is a money-making enterprise. It's becoming a booming
business as more and more immigrants find that paying smugglers
equipped with fast boats and high-tech gear improves their chances
of reaching the United States. Sometimes it goes wrong, as when 40
Haitians drowned between the Bahamas and Palm Beach County last
weekend. The Border Patrol is charged with the responsibility of
putting the alien smuggler out of business. But the Miami sector
has less than 60 agents to patrol its four-state region. The agency
hasn't seen an increase in its workforce in 10 years. During that
period, the U.S. Border Patrol has experienced dramatic growth,
doubling the number of agents to a force of nearly 8,000.
Unfortunately for the Miami sector, almost all of the thousands of
agents hired during the past few years have been assigned to Texas,
California, New Mexico and Arizona. For example: The Miami Sector
has 52 agents assigned; Laredo (Texas) has 638; El Paso has 9,752;
Tucson has 1,022; and San Diego has 2,257. Miami's budget is $6.2
million; San Diego is $178 million. (Kane, Palm Beach Post) 60

<P>
   SMUGGLE-NIGHT _ Border Patrol Agent Larry Belotti works the
graveyard shift. He says he's the often the only Border Patrol
agent working from Corpus Christi, Texas, to Vermont. One recent
night, he rounded up 26 Cubans who came ashore in Miami Beach. This
effectively shuts down the Border Patrol station because Belotti
will spend the rest of the night processing these refugees. 30
inches. (Kane, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   SMUGGLE-PUNISH _ U.S. Attorney Tom Scott says his office is
adopting an aggressive stand against alien smugglers. These cases
are tough to prosecute, particularly when Cuban refugees are
involved. Justice Department data shows that federal prosecutors
historically haven't taken on many alien smuggling cases. A couple
reasons. The smugglees make lousy witnesses. There's also the
built-in defense: ``I'm not a smuggler. I was fishing and rescued
these Cubans from their sinking raft.'' Prosecutors also have felt
that juries of Cuban exiles and other immigrants find it hard to
convict someone of helping their fellow countrymen escape
oppression. Furthermore, the courts haven't been very tough on
convicted smugglers, even if the case involves the deaths of
refugees. For example: In South Fla, the USAtty prosecuted 62
percent of cases referred by the Border Patrol; in Arizona, 92
percent; in Southern California, 99 percent; in South Texas, 99
percent. In South Fla, 26 percent of smuggling cases referred to
USAtty ended with prison sentences; in Arizona, it's 40 percent;
Southern California, 57 percent; South Texas, 58 percent. 60
inches. (Kane, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   SMUGGLE-CASES _ Seven case studies. (Kane, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   FOR MONDAY (Moved today):
</P>
<P>
   SMUGGLE-WORKSITE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's unlawful to hire
non-citizens. But Florida is still the land of opportunity. An
estimated 350,000 illegal aliens reside here. Most work in the
vegetable and citrus farms. Many keep the tourism industry booming
as waiters, hotel maids, etc. Some work on landscaping and
construction crews. But the INS cannot go into the agricultural
fields and doesn't have the manpower to do much other worksite
enforcement because it has to focus attention on alien smuggling.
Farmers hire scores of illegal workers and escape liability by
paying licensed farm labor contractors provide crews. They also
argue that workers today carry counterfeit documents. The INS says
they don't expect growers to be document experts. Migrant worker
advocates argue that farmers use their political clout to handcuff
the INS. For example: in 1990, the INS sanctioned 38 employers in
Florida for hiring illegals. That dropped to 16 in 1991, 6 in 1992
and 2 in 1993. In 1994, 1995 and 1996, it was a dozen or fewer.
Only in 1997 did it get back up to about 20-25 employers.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An arc of gray sea gulls banked against a cold gust
of wind and wheeled high above Brighton Beach toward the Atlantic
Ocean. Sofia Garber followed the birds with her big blue eyes and
pulled the fur collar of her coat to her cheeks. Standing on an
expanse of boardwalk between a line of apartment buildings and the
sand, Ms. Garber, 51, reflected on her life as a new immigrant,
part of the first wave to arrive in Brooklyn from the Soviet Union
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work all day in the city,'' said Ms. Garber, who
emigrated from Odessa, a Ukrainian resort city on the Black Sea.
``Then I would come out here on the sand to think and cry. I didn't
know what my future would be and my children's future. I would
stare at the sea gulls and think: `They are so free. They can fly
to Odessa to see my mother and I cannot.'''
</P>
<P>
   The first years were hard for Ms. Garber, but things improved.
She and her husband worked 14-hour days at a variety of jobs, made
some money, moved to a larger apartment in Brighton Beach, brought
her mother over and sent two daughters to college. Brighton Beach
is her home, Ms. Garber said, but she is glad her daughters, 31 and
25, have moved to suburban Westchester County and Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that life has to go on,'' she said. ``I wouldn't be
happy if my children should stay in Brighton Beach. Maybe different
people should be able to come to Brighton Beach and start over.
That is what America is about.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been about 25 years since the first immigrants from the
Soviet Union came to this small neighborhood in southern Brooklyn,
where the rents were low and you could walk by the sea, and turned
it into a Russian-speaking hub.
</P>
<P>
   Brighton Beach has been many things to these people: at first a
disappointment, then a beachhead in a big city, then an economic
launching pad. And now, for many of them, it seems to have become a
stepping stone to somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents say Brighton Beach is on the cusp of a slow
decline as a Russian-speaking neighborhood. The children of the
immigrants are chasing the American dream to Manhattan, to other
parts of Brooklyn and to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old people live in Brighton Beach,'' said Lyudmila Reyngach,
the owner of Oceanview Optical on Brighton Beach Avenue. ``The
young people are moving out.'' She said that she had been doing
more and more business on weekends, when people who have moved away
return to shop.
</P>
<P>
   And while immigration from the former Soviet Union has slowed in
recent years, people from Mexico, Pakistan and the Middle East have
been moving in. ``It's going to be different,'' said Marina
Shapiro, the executive director of the Brighton Beach Business
Improvement District. ``It will be a multinational neighborhood,
not just a Russian one.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent census surveys suggest that 200,000 immigrants from the
former Soviet Union live in the five boroughs of New York City,
said Andrew Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College. And
Brighton Beach still throngs with Russian-speaking people. More
than half the stores on Brighton Beach Avenue are owned by
immigrants from the former Soviet Union, and many residents say it
will take decades for the neighborhood to lose its flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Sofia Vinokurov takes a positive view. She arrived with her
family of 27 in 1975 and owns a food store called the
International, as well as a smoked-fish business and a nightclub.
``Young people aren't moving out that much from this
neighborhood,'' she said recently, as customers bustled around her.
``You see young people with carriages and babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet like the neighborhoods of Little Italy and the Lower East
Side before it, many residents said, Brighton Beach is falling
victim to the very success of its recent settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Vareljan, the chairwoman of the Russian Division of the
United Jewish Appeal, who came from Odessa in 1976 and lived for a
decade in Brighton, said: ``Ask me what will happen to Brighton
Beach. What happened to Hester Street in the Lower East Side? But
not yet. We have another 25 years, and I am sure that something
will still be there, but not like it was from 1983 to 1990.''

<P>
   In the Shadow of the El, Memories of the Baltic Sea
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood of Brighton Beach bridges the 20 blocks between
the gimcrack attractions of Coney Island and the almost suburban
Manhattan Beach. Its main street, Brighton Beach Avenue, is
shadowed by the elevated D and Q subway lines. There are apartment
buildings on the ocean side of the avenue and small houses on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern European Jews began moving into the neighborhood in the
1920s, and Jewish refugees after World War II. By the 1970s, many
of the older Jews had died or moved to Florida or to their
children's homes in the suburbs. Shops along Brighton Beach Avenue
were small and old, longtime residents said. ``It was very dirty,''
Ms. Garber recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But rents were low. The shopkeepers could communicate with the
new residents in Yiddish or Polish. And the many immigrants from
seaside cities like Odessa and Leningrad appreciated the shore
atmosphere. ``It was oceanside, and I was growing up on the Baltic
Sea,'' explained Leonid Bogorad, who came from Leningrad in 1973.
``It made me feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Brighton Beach as a Russian-speaking enclave began
in the mid-'60s, when rumors spread through the large Jewish
populations of the Soviet Union, from Leningrad to Ukraine to
Belarus to Moldavia, that the government might allow some people
with family in Israel to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Bogorad said he heard the rumor in 1970. He was in his mid-20s,
and like many of the first immigrants was prosperous by Soviet
standards. ``Believe me, I was doing OK,'' said Bogorad, who
managed a furniture store. ``In Russia if you had access to
imported furniture, you can make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Bogorad, the early immigrants were not fleeing severe
deprivation but anti-Semitism. On one hand, the Soviet Union
suppressed the practice of Judaism, so most Russian Jews knew
little about their religion. On the other hand, Jews could not
forget who they were. They were often called Zhid, a Russian curse
for Jew, beaten up in school and denied access to scholarships and
the best jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The internal passports of most Soviet citizens indicated what
region they were from, while the passports of Jews read ``Jewish,''
no matter where they were from.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was anti-Semitism everywhere,'' Bogorad said. ``Whenever
you apply for anything you have to show your passport that says you
are Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially no one was supposed to want to leave the Soviet
paradise, but small numbers of Jews were allowed to emigrate
beginning in the '50s. Emigration gained momentum in the mid-'60s
when American Jewish organizations and the U.S. government
pressured the Soviet Union to let the Jews go.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli defeat of Soviet-backed Arab forces in the Six-Day
War of 1967 slowed things a bit, but by the early '70s the U.S.
policy of detente and the Soviet Union's need for American grain
opened the gates.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, in
Washington, 17,000 people left the Soviet Union from 1968 through
1971. Most headed to Israel, but a few thousand went to the United
States. Soon reports were filtering back to the Soviet Union of a
strange place called Brooklyn. ``In Odessa everyone was talking
about Brooklyn,'' Ms. Vareljan said. ``A letter would come, and we
would all read about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence Avramenko, 54, who has the crew cut and broad chest
of an army sergeant and the stern demeanor to match, said he was an
emotional mess on the day in 1973 when he and his wife and child
left Kiev on a train bound for Austria. Avramenko, a dentist, and
his family were leaving their relatives, friends and possessions
for a world they had never seen. They were allowed to take out $100
a person and some clothes. Going back was not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sleep,'' Avramenko said of that first night on the
train. ``I was crying as we checked into Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   Most immigrants went to Vienna, where they were met by Israeli
officials. Some, however, decided to go to the United States
instead, because they had family there or they figured economic
opportunities would be better, or because they feared becoming
enmeshed in Middle East tensions. The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society,
a nonprofit group that resettles refugees, helped them get to the
United States, via Italy.
</P>
<P>
   New York did not make a good first impression on many of the
1970s immigrants. To Simon Feldman, 63, a Russian who spent seven
years in a Soviet prison during the 1950s, the city he glimpsed on
the way from John F. Kennedy International Airport seemed
depressing. ``It was cold,'' he said from his home in Florida. ``It
was dark. I was disappointed to see all the painting on the subway
trains,'' he added, referring to graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Association for New Americans, a private, nonprofit
agency, arranged for housing, health care, language training and
social services for the immigrants during their first few months
and sometimes up to a year. Those who could not be connected with
family in the city were sent to single-room-occupancy hotels until
they could find a place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garber does not remember the experience fondly. ``It was
mices and cockroaches,'' she said. ``Don't ask. It was hot, but I
was afraid to open a window. I think someone is going to kill me.''
After a few days, she said, someone suggested that she look for an
apartment in a neighborhood called Brighton Beach.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   From Factories and Diners to Chandeliers and Wallpaper
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half decades later, in early February, the United
Jewish Appeal held a glittering fund-raising party at a restaurant
called Cabaret Lido in Marine Park, Brooklyn, a few miles east of
Brighton, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the arrival of Sam
and Ludmila Kislin, who came from Odessa and made a fortune in
commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Guests were greeted by an actor in a Russian commissar's outfit
who interrogated them and gave them a ``visa.'' They then passed
through a curtain marked ``Vienna'' in Cyrillic letters and into a
buffet room marked ``Italy.'' Finally doors marked ``America'' were
opened, and the 150 guests dined in a hall decorated with Stars and
Stripes and Statues of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   There were grand bouquets of flowers and bottles of vodka and
cognac on each table. The guests came dressed to kill. Women wore
lots of makeup. Suits and dresses were cut in untraditional ways.
Some men wore diamond studs in place of ties. The buffet featured
Russian pastries, pates, seafood, sushi (a Russian favorite),
vegetables, breads, cheeses, cold cuts and caviar. And that was
before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the festivity there was also a note of nostalgia. ``It
is a time of mixed feelings,'' one guest said. ``Twenty years ago
it was not such a happy time. It was hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   For the new immigrants, life in New York was initially about
getting through the day, learning English and making some money at
whatever job they could find and keep. Bogorad spent his first five
years in factory jobs in the garment district. Ms. Garber was a
waitress on the 4 a.m. shift at a local diner. Later she took a job
kneading dough at a knish shop. When Ms. Vinokurov, a friend, wrote
to her from Odessa asking if she should follow, Ms. Garber told her
not to, delaying her by a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, I'll get down on my knees,'' she said. ``I am
suffering here, do not come. This is another tragedy for the Jewish
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The first immigrants in Brighton Beach, no more than a few
hundred, according to old-timers, were so busy eking out an
existence that few had the time, energy or money for much in the
way of communal life.
</P>
<P>
   But things slowly improved. Ms. Garber's mother came from Odessa
and helped take care of the children so that Ms. Garber could go to
school and acquire office skills, and eventually a job in the
diamond district. Her husband, from whom she is now divorced, and a
friend opened a wallpaper and chandelier shop on Brighton Beach
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Bogorad took a job driving a taxi 15 hours a day, and also sold
real estate in the evenings. ``I was exhausted,'' he said. ``But I
was young, and if you are trying to raise a family you can't be
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1975, some emigres were buying buildings with storefronts
along Brighton Beach Avenue, which sold for as little as $5,000.
Not that the businesses were an immediate success. Many struggled
to learn how to make things work in a new place. ``Those who opened
in 1975 and '76, they failed,'' Ms. Vareljan said. ``But by 1978
and '79 those that opened, they succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Gates Open and Then Close Again
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Soviet immigrants began pouring into Brighton Beach.
The Soviet authorities, courting the world in preparation for the
1980 Olympics in Moscow, loosened restrictions, and from 1978 to
1980 some 23,000 came to New York, more than twice the number that
had arrived in the previous five years. This influx, bringing
thousands of new customers, was a boon for owners of
Russian-speaking businesses.
</P>
<P>
   They also had people to advise. ``The first ones who came,
everybody called us,'' Ms. Garber remembered. ``They called my
house the Red Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1982 to 1986, when the Soviet Union was occupying
Afghanistan and President Ronald Reagan was getting tough on what
he called ``the evil empire,'' immigration to New York slowed to a
trickle: fewer than 500 people a year. But there were already so
many immigrants in Brighton Beach that the area hopped with ethnic
shops. The restaurants, in particular, became a center of social
life as they never had been in the Soviet Union. There, people ate
at home. In New York, the immigrants learned to let someone else
cook.
</P>
<P>
   Many, though, had a difficult time adjusting to American life.
Mark Handelman, the executive vice president of the New York
Association for New Americans, said that refugees from the Soviet
Union mistrusted the government and yet expected the government to
do things for them. They often withheld information from their
social workers, whom they considered to be government agents,
Handelman said, and became indignant when housing and jobs weren't
provided for them. ``They didn't understand that when they went for
an interview they didn't have the job yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   American Jews had donated tens of millions of dollars to assist
the Soviet Jews in settling in the United States, yet there was
resentment on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a great clash between the American Jewish community
and the Russians,'' said Pauline Bilus, director of resource
development at the Shorefront YM-YWHA of Brighton-Manhattan Beach,
an American who has worked with Russians since the '70s. ``The
Americans wanted them to be the humble, traditional Jews of their
grandparents' generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rural religious Jews who came from Eastern Europe a
generation or more before, most Soviet Jews were well-educated city
dwellers with little religious feeling. Some resented criticism of
how they practiced Judaism from Americans who, as they saw it, had
had it easy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there were also hurt feelings when the Americans got angry.
``They kept their shops open on the major Jewish holidays,'' Ms.
Bilus said. ``And they wondered why the American Jews didn't
embrace them.'' Today, Ms. Bilus said, the shops close on Yom
Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the crowds who wander underneath the el on Brighton
Beach Avenue still speak Russian as they browse the little stands
that sell pastries from all regions of the former Soviet Union.
They still stop before the hulking marble facades of fancy
restaurants and read the announcements of performances by the
latest Russian stars.
</P>
<P>
   A co-op complex going up at the east end of the neighborhood, by
Coney Island Avenue, has a long waiting list with many Eastern
European names.
</P>
<P>
   The last big wave of Russian-speaking immigrants arrived in the
late '80s and early '90s after the Soviet Union collapsed. More
than 20,000 came to New York in 1992 alone. But these new
immigrants were different. They were better educated, had more
money and knew more about the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them were Jewish, and greater numbers of them were
illegal immigrants, coming in from their now open country on
tourist visas and staying. Yet, residents say, the old-timers and
the newer immigrants seem to coexist well.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, the neighborhood is changing, residents say. Though no
figures are available on how many immigrants from the former Soviet
Union currently live in Brighton Beach, locals say many immigrants,
and particularly their children, are leaving or have already left.
</P>
<P>
   Leonid Bogorad, who continues to work in Brighton Beach, moved
to Long Island in 1978. Simon Feldman lives in Florida. Lydia
Vareljan moved to suburban New Jersey. None of their children lives
in Brighton.
</P>
<P>
   Now people from other lands are moving in. ``Years ago the plane
would come into New York from Russia, and they would come to my
office with the luggage,'' said Bogorad, referring to his
real-estate business. ``Now we have all different groups of
clients: Pakistanis and Indians, Spanish. The neighborhood is
mixing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants from the former Soviet Union have spread out to
Manhattan Beach, Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, Bergen
County in northern New Jersey and Nassau County, Long Island. That
has hurt Brighton, Bogorad said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Russian mafia has been forsaking Brighton Beach. ``In
the '70s Russian organized crime concentrated mostly in New York,''
said Raymond Kerr, the supervising agent in the FBI's Eastern
European Organized Crime Unit. ``Now it's in cities all over the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   `The Right Time for the Right People'
</P>
<P>
   But more threatening to Brighton's identity over the long term,
some say, is the decline in immigration. The executive vice
president of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, Leonard Glickman,
said he expected the trend to continue. He attributed it to tighter
U.S. immigration policies and the fact that many people in the
former Soviet Union who have family in the United States (a
prerequisite of legal immigration) have already come.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a dwindling number of people in Russia who could
qualify,'' Glickman said. ``And the government has made it harder
for them to assert a credible fear of persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of refugee programs for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, Kathleen Thompson, agreed that immigration
had declined, but said the rules had not changed. ``There is a
dwindling number of people in Russia who would qualify for the
U.S.,'' she said. Yet she acknowledged that rising anti-Semitism
could spur new immigration.
</P>
<P>
   So far the effects of the decline have been small, Brighton
business leaders said, though the founder of the Brighton
Neighborhood Association, Pat Singer, said some restaurateurs had
told her they were seeing fewer customers. ``But they aren't
strangling,'' she said. ``They are doing well.'' She pointed out
that new restaurants have opened in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Brighton Beach has come further, and more quickly, in
its first 25 years than other ethnic neighborhoods in New York.
Perhaps that is one reason many old-timers do not seem worried
about its future. They have gone through too much to be overly
sentimental. If the blessing that Brighton has been to them is
passed on to another group, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   As Bogorad said: ``Brighton Beach came by at the right time for
the right people. It was our place for so many years. One day it
will be for someone else.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BRING BACK THE BIG OUTDOOR FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yankee Stadium remains the House That Ruth Built, a
baseball shrine. But once upon a time, boxers lived in that house
too. And it's time boxers returned.
</P>
<P>
   If the Madison Square Garden executives want to be taken
seriously as boxing promoters, they need to bring back boxing's
summer festival, the outdoor heavyweight title fight. Put it in
Yankee Stadium or in the Mets' proposed new ball park after its
planned 2002 opening near where Shea Stadium is now.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, boxing needs the summer stage of a big New York
ball park to create the aura that a big fight deserves, an aura
that a casino-hotel or even the Garden has never quite equaled, not
even in Saturday night's heavyweight unification bout between
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we had 50,000 to 60,000 seats for Holyfield-Lewis,
we could've sold them,'' said Dave Checketts, the Garden president.
``It was the hottest ticket we've ever had at the Garden in my time
here. If a fight this big came along again, I think we'd have to
look at putting it outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever there was a big summer heavyweight title fight in New
York years ago, it was staged outdoors in Yankee Stadium or in the
old Polo Grounds. From high up there on the slopes of the upper
deck, multitudes peered toward the ring perched near second base,
surrounded by rows of ringside seats.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Louis fought outdoors here 10 times, Ezzard Charles five
times, Rocky Marciano four times.
</P>
<P>
   In the last Stadium show, Muhammad Ali outpointed Ken Norton
over 15 rounds on the chilly night of Sept. 28, 1976. But the
attendance was a disappointing 30,298 in the big Bronx ball park
where more than 70,000 watched Louis demolish Max Schmeling in a
first-round knockout in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden and Top Rank Inc. were the co-promoters of that
Ali-Norton III bout. But nobody has tried to put on a big ball park
fight in New York since then.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy to do. For any fight to fill most of all those
ball park seats, it must be a huge attraction. Even bigger than the
Holyfield-Lewis sellout.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, that next huge attraction simply doesn't exist.
But sooner or later, that huge attraction will surely develop. It
always has.
</P>
<P>
   When it does, and when the site auction begins, the Garden (as
the promoter planning to use, say, Yankee Stadium) would need to
again outbid the Las Vegas casino-hotels that have monopolized the
big title fights over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor fights create risks. The ring needs a rain canopy. The
stadium's baseball grass needs to be covered. The electronic
equipment needs to be protected.
</P>
<P>
   But if the attraction is compelling enough, the reward is worth
the risks. Four years ago, the promoter Don King's outdoor show
featuring Julio Cesar Chavez in Mexico City drew 120,000, believed
to be the largest attendance in boxing history.
</P>
<P>
   In today's economy, the ticket scale at Yankee Stadium for an
outdoor fight would be at least as high as Saturday night's
Holyfield-Lewis bout that had a top of $1,500 for a ringside seat.
The Stadium could hold at least 55,000 for a big fight.
</P>
<P>
   With tickets priced from $200 ringside to $25 in the upper deck
for Ali-Norton III in the Stadium, then newly reopened, the gate
was about $2.4 million. Ali's purse was $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Stadium's record boxing crowd was 79,000 in 1930 when Max
Schmeling won the heavyweight title from Jack Sharkey on a foul. In
1923, the year the Stadium opened, 58,000 saw lightweight champion
Benny Leonard outpoint Lew Tendler.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 at the now leveled Polo Grounds, 54,487 attended Joe
Louis' 13th-round knockout of Billy Conn. Five years later, with
Louis warning that Conn ``can run, but he can't hide'' before their
rematch at Yankee Stadium after World War II, Louis registered an
eighth-round knockout.
</P>
<P>
   In his three Stadium title fights, Marciano outpointed Ezzard
Charles, knocked out Charles and knocked out Archie Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Ingemar Johansson dethroned Floyd Patterson at the Stadium in
1959, then lost to Patterson at the Polo Grounds in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most memorable Stadium scenes involved middleweight
champion Sugar Ray Robinson's attempt to dethrone Joey Maxim as
light-heavyweight champion in 1952. Although far ahead on the three
scorecards, Robinson collapsed from heat prostration and couldn't
come out for the 14th round.
</P>
<P>
   If the Garden wants to enhance its reputation as a boxing
promoter, it needs to think about a big outdoor fight.

SCHNYDER'S TIES TO GURU RAISE CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIAN WELLS, Calif. _ The tennis star and her guru chose a
table in the sun, spread out a late lunch repast of beans, greens
and guava chips, and spoke with a mix of defensiveness and delight
about the controversial alliance that has the entire WTA Tour
buzzing in alarm.
</P>
<P>
   According to Patty Schnyder's former coach, former boyfriend,
former training partners and former parents (they have banned her
from their home), the 20-year-old Swiss player has been brainwashed
and virtually abducted by a charlatan. Rainer Harnecker, a German
faith healer, is under investigation in Germany for practicing
medicine, decidedly alternative medicine, without a proper license.
</P>
<P>
   According to Schnyder and Harnecker, 42, there has been no
brainwashing, simply a meeting of the minds and, after hours of
conversation and hands-on therapy, a trainer-athlete bond that has
strayed deep into romantic territory and taken precedence over all
previous bonds in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not love at first sight,'' protested Schnyder. ``I
thought he was crazy at first, but then I tried his system and I
started to feel better, and then when I listened to him, he started
to make so much sense to me. He understood me like no one else
has.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnyder is certainly not the first female tennis star to enter
a dalliance with a coach or trainer _ her occasional doubles
partner, Austria's Barbara Schett, is romantically involved with a
coach, and last June, Sandrine Testud of France married her
physiotherapist, Vittorio Magnelli. Nor is Schnyder the first to
dabble in alternative medicine and nutrition. Martina Navratilova
went to dietary extremes 20 years ago, and Steffi Graf, always on
the lookout for Lourdes, receives piles of unsolicited propaganda
on new cures (Harnecker once sent her his ``Viasola system'') the
way most folks receive junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   But Schnyder is the first to get involved with a
trainer/paramour who says that his methods, which appear to hinge
on a strict vegetarian diet and a variation on acupuncture known as
Baunscheidt, named for its 18th-century inventor, have cured
everything from his own bum knees to cancer. Harnecker has been
denied a German patent on his healing method, a recipe of Chinese
healing and herbs and oils that he guards like Colonel Sanders once
guarded his coating for fried chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Harnecker has further alienated the tennis community by
encouraging Schnyder to drop her full-time coach, Eric Van Harpen,
and supporting her estrangement from her parents, whom he described
as ``too controlling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure they love her,'' Harnecker added, ``but they want her
to stay like a child. The rules have always come from her parents.
For the past 20 years, she's never said what she wanted to do.
They've told her what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Harnecker denied rumors that he's a Scientologist. ``There is no
sect,'' he said. Schnyder admits that she had friends in
Switzerland check out those rumors before getting too involved with
him. ``I feel like I was careful in this,'' she said. ``But now my
whole environment has gone against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Harnecker does not bill himself as a tennis expert, but he said
he learned enough from watching his 13-year-old son play to help
Schnyder stay focused on the practice court. For fine tuning,
Schnyder said, she can easily pick up tips from other players or
even engage a bona fide tennis coach on a temporary basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you are 16, 17 and have been trained all your life, you
don't need a coach anymore,'' Harnecker said. ``You already have
your technique, your mechanics, and what you need is something for
the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance between Schnyder and Harnecker began in December in
Majorca. At first, Harnecker was brought on to work with all three
of Van Harpen's clients, Schnyder, Sylvia Plischke and Conchita
Martinez. But two weeks after they all arrived in Australia for the
start of the 1999 season, Harnecker and Schnyder were inseparable.
Schnyder's father made a futile dash to Melbourne, Australia, to
separate them, and Harnecker went back to Germany alone. Schnyder,
however, joined him there last month after a showdown with her
parents at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I had to cancel him or else the door is closed at
home,'' Schnyder said. ``But I did not cancel them; they canceled
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The WTA Tour has a code of ethics for its coaches and trainers,
but unless a player is under-age or is coerced into a sexual
situation, the organization has no authority to ban a coach on
grounds of seduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a police organization, and we can't go running
around doing bed checks on our players,'' said Bart McGuire, the
tour's chief executive officer. ``We're keeping the lines of
communication with Patty open.'' Too, the tour is keeping an eye on
Harnecker's legal status back in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Harnecker is now exclusively employed by Schnyder, but while she
insists he has made her thinner, fitter and happier, she
acknowledged that her tennis has not yet been healed. The Swiss
player, who cracked the top 10 last year at 19, has lately
accumulated a flurry of early exits including a straight-set
second-round loss to Martina Hingis here at the Evert Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my tennis more now than I did in the last two years,
but during matches, sometimes I lose completely my game,'' Schnyder
said. ``I'm on the court wondering why my shots aren't working.''
</P>
<P>
   And off the court, she's holding hands with Harnecker.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE LONG ROAD TO THE BIGGEST FIGHT FOR LEWIS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y., N.J., Canada)   (jw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There were times, back when they were nomadic
Canadian amateurs barnstorming through Europe, when Egerton Marcus
had Lennox Lewis, and Lewis had Marcus, and everyone else was an
opponent speaking a language they only understood as unfriendly to
them.
</P>
<P>
   They were young men on the rise to Olympic glory, and the only
way to get there was to get up and go, find the fights, overcome
the odds and obstacles of being far from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only way for us to get better because we couldn't
get the fights we needed in Canada,'' Marcus said. ``We went all
over Europe together, and so many nights, he'd be the only one in
the crowd rooting for me, and I'd be the only one rooting for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   They met in their late teens and the long, winding road brought
them to Madison Square Garden Saturday night, Lewis finally face to
face with Evander Holyfield, Marcus in his familiar supporting
role, among a dubious crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who question Lennox's heart,'' said Marcus, a Lewis
sparring partner for this fight, a friend forever, ``they just
don't know him.''
</P>
<P>
   And right there, without really intending to, Marcus enunciated
the mystery and majority appeal of the sold-out heavyweight
championship unification bout. It was the unmistakable notion that,
after 33 fights across a full decade, the boxing public still did
not have any real level of certitude regarding Lewis, the complete
heavyweight package minus the validation of a single night of
unquestioned exceptional achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The case could be made, in fact, that the most notable event of
Lewis' career was the night he avenged his one defeat, when the
took back his World Boxing Council title from Oliver McCall, but
mainly because McCall was seized with emotional turbulence, and
dissolved in a pool of tears. That display of dysfunction, even
more than Mike Tyson's munching on Holyfield's ears, could serve as
a 1990s requiem for the heavyweights, whose standing in the general
sports spectrum has probably sunk lower than at any time in the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The people who say that's because boxing is too crude and
corrupt for America's growing number of latte-loving consumers
haven't looked at the television ratings for professional
wrestling. Or, for that matter, Jerry Springer. Boxing isn't dying
as much as it has cried itself to a state of suspended animation.
There have been more compelling fights in Knicks-Miami playoff
series than there have been in the heavyweight division since Tyson
moved down in class to the criminal justice division.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield could at least proudly say he has been in most of
them, and point to the scars of three epic battles with Riddick
Bowe, in addition to his experiences with the shadow that once was
Tyson. The most famous name in Lennox Lewis' portfolio of opponents
is Phil Jackson (KO, 8) on May 6, 1994, in Atlantic City,
apparently the same night Michael Jordan was gambling between
playoff games with the Knicks. Oh, not that Phil Jackson? Well,
anyway, Lewis, who as a young fighter would go anywhere to fight
anyone, had somehow managed over 10 professional years to not fight
Bowe, Tyson and Holyfield, the only three heavyweights he could
have proved himself against.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys could see how big, strong and quick Lennox is, and
they didn't want to fight him,'' Marcus said. ``They didn't want to
take the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   That has always been the Lewis camp spin, and, of course, the
others claimed Lewis wanted no part of them, that he lacked the
fiber, if not the skills. They said he was better suited to his
beloved rounds of chess.
</P>
<P>
   Egerton Marcus took particular offense at this. He considers
himself a pretty tough guy _ the middleweight silver medalist at
the Seoul Olympics in 1988, when Lewis won the super heavyweight
gold _ and at least the equal of Lewis in chess.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't beat me as much as I beat him,'' Marcus said,
before thinking better and declaring their rivalry a draw.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus grew up in Toronto, Lewis in nearby Kitchener. They
stayed at each other's homes, knew each other's friends. They were
teammates, and rivals. He was often the victim of Lewis' practical
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd do things like put a rock in my luggage, and I'd get
pulled over going through customs at the airport,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   His own promising career, hampered by injuries, took him to
Holyfield's camp as a sparring partner. For this fight, he had been
the Holyfield stand-in, the shorter man, trying to get inside
Lewis' jab, to the body, against the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox is naturally strong, stronger than Evander,'' Marcus
said. ``When he hits you, he moves you.''
</P>
<P>
   All those nights when it was just them, sharing their dreams in
faraway places, Egerton Marcus could see all those lesser fighters
who were moved out of Lewis' way. He came to the Garden Saturday
night to find out, once and for all, if Lewis could punch away the
last remaining obstacle to becoming the undisputed champion of the
world.

GAME SERVES AS AN ELIXIR FOR BASEBALL-SAVVY DOMINICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ Omar Minaya stared out the
window of the New York Mets' team bus, taking in the devastation
Hurricane Georges had wrought.
</P>
<P>
   As senior assistant general manager and head of international
scouting for the Mets, this was not Minaya's first visit back to
his homeland since the hurricane hit last September. But its
effects on Minaya _ and the island _ had obviously not worn off by
the time the Mets arrived here Friday morning for a pair of
exhibition games against the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   What was once a plush grove of palm trees lining the way from
the Aeropuerto de las Americas to the capital was now a surrealist
exhibition of uprooted and disfigured palms, fronds bowed and bent,
trunks turned around and upside down. It is now an utterly barren
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this stuff used to be beautiful palm trees,'' Minaya said
softly. ``Now, it's total destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I can only think of how I've been coming here so
many years, looking at players, and how this was always such a
beautiful trip. But the first imprint that comes to my mind today
is the thought of how this drive used to be and how it is no
more.''
</P>
<P>
   All Minaya wanted to do was get to Santo Domingo, a vibrant city
of nearly 3 million people, and forget about the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to see the smiles of the people because of
baseball,'' Minaya explained.
</P>
<P>
   The sport is deeply ingrained in the Dominican culture. As the
Mets' team bus pulled into Quesqueya Stadium on Saturday morning, a
flood of children in multi-colored uniforms enveloped the players,
bursting on to the scene from an adjacent field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go with these guys,'' said Paul Wilson, who was
scheduled to pitch for the Mets Saturday. ``I'll bet they have more
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and the Expos could not help enjoying themselves here
on Friday night, as the Mets rallied late for a 6-3 victory.
Merenque blared from the stadium loudspeakers between innings.
Cheerleaders danced on the dugout tops. No one had to tell the
near-capacity crowd when to clap. The fans did it on their own, to
a beat of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``For baseball purists, this is like heaven,'' Minaya said, his
face beaming as he sat seat by the dugout. ``Yes, the music is
loud. But there's no giant screen to tell you to clap now. Here,
you clap if you want to and don't if you don't.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The same goes for dancing or chanting. Baseball here is a
fiesta. And, as Minaya had hoped, it apparently has helped the
people to forget about the devastating storm, or at least to put it
aside for a time. For baseball is a link to the past. Especially
for Minaya, who left his inland town of Valverde Mao, near the
border with Haiti, for New York, when he was 8.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the United States that Minaya first played organized
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some recollections of playing baseball in the Dominican
Republic as a boy, but never on a team,'' Minaya said.
</P>
<P>
   In America, he grew up in the shadow of Shea Stadium and was a
Mets fan ``when they did not play the Giants and the Pirates. ``I
always rooted for Marichal and Clemente,'' Minaya said of the two
greatest Latin players of that erea.
</P>
<P>
   Minaya developed into enough of a ball player himself to be
taken in the 14th round of the 1978 draft by the Oakland A's. But
the young outfielder never made it past Class A ball and spent his
last two seasons as a player in Europe, living in a villa in the
Tuscany region of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, something was always calling Minaya back to his roots.
``Up here, I'm probably American,'' Minaya said, pointing to his
head. ``But I'm Dominican inside. That's my bloodline. And that
never goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Minaya landed a job with the Texas Rangers as an area
scout, working New York, New Jersey and the Dominican Republic,
where he would re-establish his ties back home.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rangers, Minaya would go on to coach Juan Gonzalez and
sign Sammy Sosa as he rose to become the team's director of
scouting. When the Mets hired him, in September 1997, he took on
the added responsibilities of assistant general manager. But Minaya
continues to scout to this day. He was even scheduled to look over
a pitching prospect here Saturday afternoon _ all the while
savoring the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how I picture baseball to be in the 1940s and '50s,''
Minaya said. ``This has an atmosphere to it. It's like reliving the
baseball that I heard of and that I read about. These are not the
greatest clubhouses or fields. But there is a personal attachment
between the fans and the players. You play baseball here for the
love of the game. And that's what I love about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the storm was not forgotten, it had at least receded.

SPORTS COLUMN: FIVE POINTS OF LIGHT SAVE GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although bitter and hurt at not having been chosen independent
counsel for the Olympic investigation, I have decided to share my
recommendations with the International Olympic Committee, which
meets this week to whitewash itself.
</P>
<P>
   The following five points, if followed, will return the image of
the Games to something almost worthy of Bud Greenspan's elegiac
documentaries or the grand pronouncements of the senior American
IOC member, Anita DeFrantz. They will save the Games as our
beleaguered planet's only truly international television soap opera
and one of the few events with the power to stop, or at least
interrupt, war, famine, pestilence and politics.
</P>
<P>
   1. Reopen the Pelops probe. For centuries, it has been whispered
that the Olympics began when Pelops bribed King Oenomaus' groom to
loosen the axle on his master's chariot. Pelops won the race and
went on to claim the dead loser's daughter and kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   As a little thank-you to the gods, Pelops founded the all-male
Games. Athletes were naked and no women were allowed to watch. Only
Dionysus knows what really went on. Secret payoffs of olive-oil
franchises to winners were the least of it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's clear that case now. If the Olympics really began with a
fixed race, then blaming the current rings-leader, Juan Antonio
Samaranch, for turning a blind eye to corruption is just plain
unfair. It's the system he inherited. And he's done a darn fine job
of maintaining it.
</P>
<P>
   2. Find the silver chalice, the Maltese Falcon of the Games.
When it was discovered that Jim Thorpe had played minor-league
baseball, thus compromising his amateur status, Olympic officials
took back the two gold medals he had won at the 1912 Stockholm
Games. Everyone knows that.
</P>
<P>
   But they also took back a jewel-encrusted silver chalice in the
shape of a Viking ship presented to him by Czar Nicholas II of
Russia. Officials claimed it was only a ``traveling'' trophy. God
knows what that chalice is worth now.
</P>
<P>
   The only Olympic official who responded to the attempt by Grace
Thorpe to get the chalice for her father's museum was Robert
Helmick, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee. Alas, he soon
stepped down from the presidency amid allegations of conflict of
interest. Helmick thought it might have ``traveled'' to IOC
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Is the chalice still in the palace? Or was it melted down to
make a lot of rings and brooches for IOC members and their
sweeties? Crack that case and we're on our way to closure.
</P>
<P>
   3. Let's move past the 1936 Holocaust Games. The current
controversy, provoked by the Simon Wiesenthal Center's
dissemination of anti-Semitic letters written by top Olympic
officials as they lobbied the world to give Berlin and the Nazis a
happy news platform, serves no further purpose.
</P>
<P>
   That the future Olympic czar Avery Brundage might have made
gazillions building the German Embassy in Washington if World War
II had not interfered is no longer relevant. This is exactly the
kind of old stuff that turns off younger viewers. People who want
to beat that drum will only drive the Olympics off the networks and
onto the History Channel.
</P>
<P>
   4. Make performance-enhancing products equally available to all.
These include athletic shoes, muscle-compression garments, sports
drinks, psychological and spiritual services, and, of course, such
biochemical aids as liquor (for shooters), steroids, blood-packing
gear, human growth hormone, amphetamines, anti-depressants,
you-name-it-we'll-cook-it.
</P>
<P>
   As long as only the wealthier athletes have access to doctors
who know how to mask and cycle, there can be no true fair play. Why
shouldn't a kayaker from a poor family have the same opportunity as
a blue-blood equestrian or a celebrity runner backed by a
corporation? Random testing should be for IQ and screen appeal
only. Let stupid and ugly athletes go to college, but not to these
Games.
</P>
<P>
   5. Make the Games truly professional. Every athlete who shows up
for the opening-day parade gets at least the minimum fee due an
extra in a television miniseries. The scale rises with screen time,
which means that a luger with a heartbreaking story that keeps us
tuning in for days could make more money than, say, the
latest-model ice doll. Of course, if said ice doll wins a gold
medal, there would be a big bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The money would come from several sources, including the
national organizations and athletic federations that routinely
reward athletes for victories now, from television and from
commercial sponsors. Corporations and politicians would be given
naming privileges.
</P>
<P>
   If for a mere $15 million in expenses and bribes you get the
Salt Lake City Games, how many college scholarships,
hip-replacement operations and Dionysian nights could be offered
needy IOC members in return for, say, the Dole/Viagra Javelin
Throw?
</P>
<P>
   As brilliant as these recommendations may seem to some, they are
not to be construed as part of a last-ditch job application.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are over as a major social force, and I am moving
on as well.
</P>
<P>
   I have decided to pursue becoming independent counsel for the
investigation into the National Collegiate Athletic Association.

A NEW YORK EXPORT TO KENYA: STRETCHING LESSONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAPSAIT, Kenya _ Jim Wharton, an exercise physiologist from New
York City, rode in the back of a four-wheel-drive vehicle up a
bumpy mountainside to a shrine of his sport. He passed donkeys. He
passed a man carrying a shaggy sheep. Barefoot boys waved. The air
felt thinner.
</P>
<P>
   A car drove by, and Wharton poked his head out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do some stretching exercises,'' he called out
with great excitement.
</P>
<P>
   The two men inside, young runners in track suits, smiled
tolerantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe later,'' the driver said and pulled away down the rutted
road.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton, a peppy 57, came to Kenya _ minus his luggage, which
got lost along the way _ because he is an expert on stretching.
Here in the Rift Valley is where some of the world's greatest
runners train, and stretching is not something many of them like
very much.
</P>
<P>
   While Kenyans have long dominated long-distance running,
Wharton, a dedicated runner himself, was invited to three elite
running camps to see if he could help with a problem he says is
relatively recent: As the runners go faster and faster,
consistently running marathons under 2 hours 10 minutes, they are
getting hurt more and more.
</P>
<P>
   But he also came to take a half-awed, half-skeptical look at
exactly what it is that makes Kenya continue to produce such superb
runners, three decades after the nation won its first gold medals
in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction back in the United States was: could it
really be that much better?'' he asked. ``I mean, we've got
altitude. We've got wonderful places. It's not that you're
suspicious. You're curious. You look at all aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not pause. He may have been raised in West Virginia, but
he is unmistakably a New Yorker now. ``Is there something in the
food?'' he asked. That was just the start of a treatise on running
surfaces, the ``architecture'' of the foot, the lack of
distractions and the cooperative nature of training. ``It's
attitude, not altitude,'' he finally concluded. ``The attitude is
magic.''
</P>
<P>
   His mission for the day was to teach 30 athletes at a running
camp in this atom-sized town in western Kenya _ altitude just over
10,000 feet _ stretching routines that he and his son, Phil, have
been preaching for more than a decade. The basic idea, which they
learned from a retired professor from the University of Illinois,
Aaron Mattes, is that most athletes do it all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than stretching a limb and holding the muscle taut for 20
or 30 seconds, they teach what they call ``active-isolated
stretching.'' Each stretching exercise is aimed at one particular
muscle group, which is then contracted and relaxed 10 or so times
and held in one place no longer than two or three seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Moses Tanui, who won the Boston Marathon in 1996 and 1998, and
runs one of the three camps, has used the technique. So has Joshua
Kimaiyo, 26, a runner and brother of Eric Kimaiyo, who owns the
camp here and has won the Honolulu marathon twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never stretched before,'' Joshua Kimaiyo said. ``We came
home from training and we were too tired.'' That is understandable:
the athletes run an average of 15 miles a day, rarely on flat
surfaces. Kimaiyo's hip started bothering him a year ago and last
fall in Italy he worked with Wharton on a stretching routine. He
said it has worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than injections,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton said, ``There's more, I won't say pressure, but more
challenge, to push the envelope. As they push the envelope, it's
still a human body.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wharton became interested in stretching after Phil, while a
runner at the University of Florida, developed a curvature of the
spine. Nothing helped, including acupuncture and chiropractors,
Wharton said, until they came upon the stretching routines. They
say that the stretching straightened Phil's spine.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton was invited to Kenya by Dr. Gabrielle Rosa, an Italian
doctor and trainer at the three camps, which are sponsored in part
by Fila, a shoe company. Fila was forced to dress Wharton because
his own clothes were lost somewhere between Kenya and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Also lost in the luggage was a set of ropes that Wharton loops
around feet and legs for the stretching routines. So on a recent
morning he went to a hardware store in Eldoret, the main city in
this area and arguably the running center of Kenya, and bought
several dozen yards of rope. He wrapped the frayed ends in red and
green tape, the colors of Kenya's flag. Then he rode the 60 miles
to the camp.
</P>
<P>
   With some prodding, the trainers managed to haul two dozen of
the athletes higher, to a flat spot on a peak with a view of the
green hills and gold plains of the Rift Valley. Wharton lay down
and began pelvic warm-ups. Then it was on to the hamstrings, the
thigh, the lower back. The runners, fumbling with their ropes,
groaned.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Simon Biwott, 28, nonetheless proclaimed it ``very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel after stretching, the body is somehow more healthy
than before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ngolepus, 18, an aspiring marathoner, had similar praise,
though he was a bit more terse. ``My muscles became good,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton, far from home, was more emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost lost it,'' he said. ``I am here on a hillside in
Kenya teaching guys who don't even know how to stretch.''

MARBURY BRINGS AGGRESSIVE MESSAGE TO NETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See MARBURY-HOMETOWN) 
 (bl)  
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The New Jersey Nets' days of ignoring their coaches'
play calls, squandering double-digit leads late in the game, and
breaking down mentally under the stress and emotion of a
hard-fought contest are over, as far as Stephon Marbury is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, the audacious point guard from Brooklyn, N.Y., who was
traded to the Nets on Thursday, will not stand for such
dysfunction. He proved as much Friday night when, in street clothes
and on the sideline, he chastised his new teammates as they
surrendered yet another fourth-quarter lead and lost one more game
they should have won.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with conviction and without hesitation, the 22-year-old
Marbury told the Nets to follow Coach John Calipari's game plan and
accept the challenge of holding off the charging Philadelphia
76ers. The fact that he had not played a second, was more than two
years younger than everyone else in the huddle, and perhaps coming
off as a bit abrasive for someone who had joined the team less than
24 hours earlier, never entered his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win, and when you want to win, you don't care,''
said Marbury, who will make his Nets debut in a nationally
televised game Sunday afternoon against the Miami Heat. ``And I
think these guys want to win so they're not looking at it as I'm
jumping down their throats. I think they're looking at it as: `This
guy wants to win and he's going to do whatever it takes to win.
He's going to tell you if something's wrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   That inborn leadership that comes to Marbury as naturally as a
behind-the-back dribble is one of the many reasons the Nets gave up
three players and potentially two first-round draft picks to trade
for the former Minnesota Timberwolves star. His quickness, scoring
ability, knack for passing, and poise during intense moments of
competition combine to make him a great player.
</P>
<P>
   But his greatest attribute may be his willingness and courage to
lead. It is certainly the one that the rudderless Nets (3-16) need
most.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Stephon, what you have is a leader, a warrior, a player
who's going to come at you and wants to win in the worst way, a
player who's going to make everybody better,'' Calipari said.
``He'll make my job easier. His mom said, `I see you on TV jumping
around.' And I said: `I won't have to do that anymore. Now, I can
sit and watch a little bit.'''
</P>
<P>
   What Calipari will see will certainly look a lot better than
anything he has witnessed in the past two and a half years. In
Keith Van Horn, Kerry Kittles and Marbury, who practiced with the
Nets for the first time Saturday at Miami University, New Jersey
has perhaps the greatest young nucleus in the National Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Hoop pundits regarded Marbury and Kevin Garnett, Minnesota's
All-Star forward, as the John Stockton and Karl Malone of the next
generation, but the league's most prolific one-two punch of the
future will now play its home games in the Meadowlands. Marbury and
Van Horn, the 6-foot-10-inch forward averaging more than 22 points
and eight rebounds a game, give the Nets two superstars, two
perennial All-Stars in the making and two players who can't wait to
get on the court together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as excited as can be that he's here,'' Van Horn said
Friday. ``He's what we've been lacking. I was sitting at dinner
with Jayson Williams last night and I told him that it feels like
the biggest weight has been taken off my shoulders, because it's
been hard and difficult for me.''
</P>
<P>
   With Sam Cassell, whom the Nets traded to Milwaukee in the
three-team deal for Marbury, missing 14 games this season with a
sprained right ankle, the burden of carrying the Nets' offense fell
solely on Van Horn's broad shoulders. Without a true point guard to
orchestrate the pick-and-roll, Van Horn has been forced to score
the bulk of his points on dribble-drive isolation plays that left
him drained of energy late in games. Though his scoring has not
suffered, he has been worn down because of the precious few easy
baskets he has made.
</P>
<P>
   With Marbury, one of the league's finest young clutch players,
all of that will end, as the duo should be deadly on the
pick-and-roll. Marbury, who has an outstanding knowledge of the
game and has already offered insightful critiques of many of his
new teammates, said Van Horn's outside shooting ability should
enable them to run a more effective pick-and-roll than he and
Garnett did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see pick-and-roll all day with me and Keith,'' said Marbury,
who will wear No. 33 for the Nets. ``He can shoot the 3, so that
makes him more of a weapon because he has the in-between game and
he has the 3-point game. So the pick-and-roll can be set high or
low. Keith is a player who I think I can help raise to
superstardom.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury also envisions one of the league's finest backcourts in
himself and Kittles. Marbury demanded that Kittles remain a Net for
the trade to go through. Kittles, who has struggled mightily this
season, shooting a career-low 34 percent, expects Marbury to serve
as his perfect pick-me-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to play with him,'' Kittles said. ``With his
ability to break down defenders, penetrate the lane and find the
open man, he should have an immediate impact on my game.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Marbury's aggressive style of verbal leadership, the Nets
were far from offended. Humbled after stumbling to the worst record
in the Eastern Conference, they believe that is just what they
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for a point guard to come in and say those things,''
the veteran swingman Kendall Gill said. ``You can say it as a
forward or a center, but if you're not directing the offense you
don't really have control over it. So it's good for Stephon to say
it because he is the one who will have control over running the
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Nets are Marbury's team.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   The details of the draft picks the Nets surrendered in the trade
are as follows: Minnesota has until April 1 to decide between
taking the Nets' 1999 first-round pick unconditionally or only if
the Nets do not receive one of the top three picks. If they take
the pick unconditionally, it is the only Nets draft choice
Minnesota receives in the trade. If it selects the second option
and the Nets have the fourth pick or lower, it also receives the
Nets' first-round pick in 2003. If it selects the second option and
the Nets have one of the first three picks, it receives a
first-round pick in 2000 and 2003 but not in 1999.

DECISION ON 32ND TEAM NEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob McNair wants to own the National Football League's 32nd
team, and wants it in Houston. Eli Broad and Michael Ovitz, who are
leading competing expansion groups in Los Angeles, want the team in
their city.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is expected to make its decision Tuesday. If it's
Houston, McNair would get the team. But if it's Los Angeles, the
league could choose the city, not one of the groups, and hope to
lure other potential owners to an auction. Last year's auction to
sell the Cleveland Browns brought $530 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prepared to pay the market value, but not above market
value,'' said McNair, who has contacted eight teams about moving to
Houston if he loses to the expansion race to Los Angeles. The ante
could be at least $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL's encouraged me to do this,'' said McNair, who
recently sold the bulk of his power generation company for $1.1
billion. ``And I've got sufficient personal assets to make the NFL
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broad group is looking to gut the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum and build a new stadium; Ovitz and his investors want to
build in Carson, Calif. They both lag behind Houston in firm
financing to build stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the media markets were the same size, then Los Angeles
would be at a significant disadvantage,'' said Broad, the
billionaire chairman of SunAmerica, an insurance company. ``But Los
Angeles is the second-largest market, and ratings have been down
without a team there.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad and McNair said that even at a steep price, the team could
be a decent investment. ``I don't do philanthropy in business or
sports,'' McNair said. ``We can run it and make money. But there
are better businesses than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Broad: ``If you want immediate returns on investment, you
don't get into football. But five years out, the team values will
go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad disputed the impression that some owners do not want to
return to the Coliseum. `The USC crime rate is down 47 percent in
recent years,'' he said. ``The Coliseum's problem was the Los
Angeles Raiders.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz recently said: ``It's up to the owners to see if they want
to go back to where they've been. What works in Los Angeles is
something new, fresh and exciting.''

ST. JOHN'S MAKES IT LOOK EASY IN VICTORY OVER INDIANA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ During a news conference Friday at the South
Regional, a reporter from Indiana asked St. John's coach Mike
Jarvis whether he would use a zone defense against the Hoosiers,
since they do not execute their halfcourt offense as well when not
facing man-to-man defense.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis asked the reporter if he was setting him up by dispensing
bad information or if he would be proven accurate.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the reporter was right, and he had better
make sure Indiana coach Bob Knight never learns his identity.
</P>
<P>
   Using a zone defense for all but the first few minutes of
Saturday's game, St. John's dominated the Hoosiers, eliminating the
easy layups on which they rely and cruising to a shockingly easy
86-61 victory.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's, which was not ranked in any of the polls when the
season began, now advances to the regional semifinals of the NCAA
tournament for the first time since 1991. No matter the result, the
trip assures the Red Storm that this season will be viewed as a
success. St. John's will play the winner of Saturday's second game,
between Maryland and Creighton, on Thursday in Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   So easy was the victory over Indiana that even when the Red
Storm endured a momentary swoon midway through the second half, the
lead was still 18 points. With five minutes remaining in the game,
the lead was back up to 23, and with two minutes left the walk-ons
were in, the lead was 30 and point guard Erick Barkley was
embracing everyone on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Only a nitpicker _ and a coach _ would note that the margin of
victory would have been much larger if St. John's had shot its free
throws as successfully as it did everything else. Everything else _
the tight defense, the professional interior passing, the dominance
on the boards _ was practically flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Only at the start did the Red Storm look as if it would have a
struggle. St. John's was down by 12-9 going into the first
television timeout with 15 minutes 36 seconds left in the first
half, the result of three easy layups and an A.J. Guyton 3-pointer.
St. John's came out of the timeout in a zone, and Luke Recker,
Indiana's shooting guard, hit a 3-pointer to make the lead 15-9.
</P>
<P>
   But after that, St. John's went on a 13-0 run _ including
3-pointers by Barkley (seven points, five assists in the first
half), Ron Artest (10 points) and Lavor Postell (10 points) _ to
give St. John's a 22-15 lead. During that run, St. John's missed
four free throws that could have extended the lead, but Indiana got
just one easy layup in the rest of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, which shot better than 60 percent from the field and
took just three 3-pointers against George Washington in the first
round, resorted almost exclusively to jumpers. The Hoosiers tried
11 3-pointers and made just four, and were 12 of 27 from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, everyone seemed to be hitting for St. John's. Center
Tyrone Grant, still hampered by an infected cut on his right hand,
made two straight layups _ one on a nice move along the baseline
and another while cutting through the lane, as he took a bullet
pass from Barkley. The St. John's lead was up to 10 points with
5:03 left in the first half when Barkley hit a floater in the lane.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Everything Indiana did, St. John's seemed to do one better.
After Recker, a former Mr. Basketball in Indiana, hit another
3-pointer, Bootsy Thornton responded with one for St. John's.
Indiana's William Gladness lofted a hook over Artest, but Artest
took a foul-line pass from Postell into the lane for a layup. He
followed with a 3-pointer and, on the next possession, stripped
Recker to start a fast break that resulted in a Grant layup.
</P>
<P>
   On the last possession of the half, Artest, who had missed five
3-pointers, passed up two open shots to pass inside to Thornton,
who finished with a layup for a 45-30 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Except for poor free-throw shooting _ St. John's was 9-of-15
from the line in the first half _ the Red Storm played a nearly
perfect first half, shooting 55.6 percent from the field and
hitting 6-of-12 3-pointers. The Red Storm had 12 assists on 15
field goals highlighted by the spectacular interior passing, and
dominated on the boards against the much larger Indiana lineup,
19-11. The aggressive defense resulted in nine steals.
</P>
<P>
   The second half was merely more of the same. Thornton opened the
half with a 3-pointer and, after Gladness hit a layup, Thornton,
who seemed insulted when the announcer called him Bootsy Thompson
in the pre-game introductions, hit a fall-away jumper. Artest
followed with a 3-pointer and the lead was up to 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   After Indiana's Rob Turner committed a foul, he began to walk
dejectedly upcourt with the ball tucked under his arm. Barkley
swooped in and ripped the ball out of Tucker's hands as surely as
St. John's tore this game from Indiana's weak grasp.

BRAVES AND YANKEES ARE ROLE MODELS FOR EVERYDAY CONSISTENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ When the Houston Astros gathered for the first
full-squad workout of spring training, their manager told them he
wanted to be just like the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves, someone later asked? Why do you want to be
like the Atlanta Braves? They either do not get to the World
Series, or they lose the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well, I'd like to be like the Buffalo Bills, too,'''
Larry Dierker said, referring to the team that made four
consecutive Super Bowl appearances without winning. What is this
guy, a loser? Not by any means.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just like to be good every single year and have a chance
to get to the World Series,'' Dierker said. ``The playoffs are a
crapshoot. You hope you're hot. If we get into the playoffs enough,
I think we'll eventually go to the World Series. To me, the
playoffs have to be the first goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros reached the playoffs the last two seasons under
Dierker, who emerged from the broadcast booth to become a
championship manager. But in his mind, two years is only a start.
The Braves have made the past seven playoffs, showing a consistency
that makes Dierker and other managers envious.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves and the New York Yankees have become role models.
Other teams would like nothing more than to be able to emulate
their style of play, professionalism and success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are going to be critical if you don't advance to the
playoffs or get to the World Series,'' Dierker said, ``I hope
they're that successful in their lives that they do every last
thing right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Phillies are nowhere near even the Astros'
recent status, but they, too, see the Braves as an ideal role
model.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really have a good thing going,'' Terry Francona, the
Phillies' young manager, said. ``They have a great pitching staff.
They have a very competitive lineup, sometimes dominant. Then they
replace somebody every year and get somebody else. They're really
doing it right. That's what we're shooting for. They haven't won
the World Series people think they should, but every year they're
consistently good. That's what we've been talking about for two
years. We'd like to get good and stay good.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker recalled a scene from the Braves' victory over the
Astros in a 1997 playoff game that epitomized the Braves' way of
doing business. ``When they won the last game,'' Dierker said,
``they just walked out and shook hands and walked back to the
dugout. We would have been so excited we would have been in a big
pile climbing all over each other. For them it was just business.
OK, we've taken this step; now, let's take the next step. To me,
that tells you they expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when they play regular-season games, Dierker said, the
Braves maintain a low-key approach, eschewing overconfidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play hard all the time and they play excellent
baseball,'' he said. ``That's where I want to get here. This is the
way you're expected to play, and you can transcend generations
where if you lose a Craig Biggio or a Shane Reynolds, the next guy
comes in and knows this is what's expected. You're expected to win;
you're expected to know what to do. It becomes a habit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who have reached the playoffs the last four years,
winning World Series in two of them, have impressed their American
League rivals in a similar way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've heard it once, I've heard it 100 times from my
players,'' Mike Hargrove, the Cleveland Indians' manager, said.
``They look at the Yankees in '98 as a tremendous model in what
intensity and work ethic does for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Parrish was the Detroit Tigers' bench coach the last two
seasons before becoming their manager last Sept. 1. He has been no
less impressed with the Yankees' approach to their jobs and their
task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really respected what the Yankees have done over the last
few years,'' he said. ``When you go into town and watch them take
infield, watch them take batting practice, they're very
professional about their job. They come to work every day. They run
the bases well. They run them hard. That's great to see out of a
good club. They play the game the way it's supposed to be played,
unlike some of the teams you see.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of those other teams, Parrish cited the 1997
Baltimore Orioles. ``They had all that talent, but it was like they
played when they wanted to play,'' he said. ``They played in
spurts. You just had a feeling watching Baltimore that year that
when they got in the playoffs they were going to get beat because
they didn't come to work. Some teams have the talent, but they
don't come to play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Omar Vizquel, the Indians' shortstop, saw how the Yankees
played. ``I was really impressed,'' he said, ``not only because
they won 114 games, but they kept that intensity in the playoffs.
Sometimes when you win 114 games, you think everything is going to
be easy and you take things for granted. But they came to the
playoffs with that same intensity.''

GOALS TO PREVENT LETHARGY  
 EVOLUTION OF STRIKE ZONE  
 STRATEGY FOR BROTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians are
considered the dominant teams in their divisions, with seemingly no
one between them and the playoffs. Of the trio, though, the Indians
appear to have the clearest path, because no one in the American
League Central is in position to challenge them.
</P>
<P>
   How do the Indians plan to stay awake all season instead of
slumbering until October? Manager Mike Hargrove has a strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come out and said our goal is to win 100 games in the
regular season and win the World Series,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His pronouncement might have caught his team's attention, but it
invited criticism from outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately,'' Hargrove related, ``I got feedback that how
arrogant that is. I wasn't being arrogant. I wasn't saying we're
going to do it. I said that's our goal. Before, we said let's get
to the postseason and we'll take our chances. All you're doing is
camouflaging your real goals. I thought, what better way to put us
all on notice that our goal is to win 100 games during the regular
season and win the World Series. It's not arrogant. There's not a
cockiness. It's just our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Evolution of Strike Zone
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the new strike zone, the one with higher but
narrower strikes, an American League umpire, Rocky Roe, offered
insight into the evolution of the mostly shrunken zone. He traced
the beginning of the change to the 1976 World Series, when, he
said, George Steinbrenner saw what he believed was a difference in
National and American League umpiring.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was the result of the chest protectors the
umpires wore. AL umpires still used the outside protector after
their NL counterparts had switched to inside protectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when they said anybody coming into the major leagues
would have to use an inside protector because they wanted to
standardize the strike zone,'' Roe said. ``Over the course of time,
because of pitching coaches and the inside protector, the strike
zone shrunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coaches, he said, stressed that pitchers should keep
the ball low in the strike zone. As the pitchers became more
successful at doing that, umpires saw more pitches low in the
strike zone, Roe recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course of time,'' he said, ``the strike zone went
down because that's where the majority of pitches were and because
the inside protector allowed the umpires to get lower. You see the
pitch on the knees much better. When they were using the outside
protector, they saw the high pitch good. That's why the American
League at one time was known as the high-ball league.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only could the umpires get lower with the inside protector,
but they also began setting up between the batter and the catcher's
inside shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the inside protector,'' Roe said, ``you do work in the
slot and you see the inside corner better and the outside corner
sometimes you have to guess. Over the years the strike zone went
wide.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the wide strike the commissioner's office wants to take
away, although Roe argued that umpires have not given pitchers as
much off the plate as their critics claim. Television cameras, he
said, distort the view because their angle is not head-on.
</P>
<P>
   Strategy for Brothers
</P>
<P>
   During the winter, a trade separated the brothers Bret and Aaron
Boone, and a free-agent signing enabled Roberto Alomar to join his
brother Sandy Jr. Bret and Roberto are second basemen, meaning
their brothers are in a position to take them out in attempts to
break up double plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't get me,'' Atlanta's Bret, grinning impishly, said of
Aaron, Cincinnati's third baseman. ``He can try as hard as he
wants. You tell him that. I'd like him to try. I'll let him slide
by and laugh at him. Tell him that. I'm sure he's going to try to
get me, but I don't think he can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alomars, who like the Boones have followed their father into
the major leagues, are together with Cleveland, the first time they
have been teammates since they were with San Diego in 1989. Sandy
said he was never concerned he would hurt Robby in a hard slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the speed to get there in time so I don't have to
worry about it,'' Sandy said. ``I tried a couple times. It's hard
to get him because he goes in different directions all the time.
He's too unpredictable. He goes back and forth, to the sides. He
doesn't do the same thing all the time.''

UCONN AND RUTGERS MAKE IT LOOK EASY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The women's basketball teams from Connecticut and Rutgers, both
ranked among the top 10 nationally, waltzed away with their
first-round games Friday night in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament. Sunday night, with perhaps not too much
more difficulty, they get an opportunity to advance to the Round of
16.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the NCAA tournaments, men and women, would have the
nation's 64 strongest teams. It doesn't work out that way because
the champions of weaker conferences automatically get into the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, those less-tested teams pull off a stunning
upset, as the Harvard women did last year against top-seeded
Stanford. But for every surprise, there are two or three runaways,
like those orchestrated by Connecticut and Rutgers. UConn decimated
St. Francis of Pennsylvania, 97-46, and Rutgers put away a good but
outclassed Dartmouth team, 84-70, in a game that was hardly that
close.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut (28-4) and Rutgers (27-5) tied for the
regular-season title in the Big East. St. Francis is the Northeast
Conference champion, Dartmouth the Ivy League champion.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's games served as warm-ups for the winners. Sunday night,
again playing on their home courts, Connecticut meets Xavier of
Ohio (24-8) and Rutgers faces Arizona (18-10).
</P>
<P>
   Xavier made 64 percent of its shots in the first half in beating
Florida International, 85-71. Arizona, although falling behind by
17 points, escaped with an 87-84 overtime victory over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   UConn is seeded first in the Mideast, Rutgers third in the
Midwest. Both are expected to move on to those regional
competitions next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   If the favorites keep winning, Connecticut will advance to
Cincinnati in a regional joining Clemson, Georgia and Iowa State.
Rutgers would play in Normal, Ill., with Purdue, Texas Tech and
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut and Rutgers stunned their first-round foes with
superior height and speed, unrelenting defense and quick transition
games. In the opening minutes in Storrs, Conn., UConn went on an
early 19-2 run and led at the half by 59-20. In Piscataway, N.J.,
Rutgers started with a 12-0 run and led by 33-10 and 42-14.
</P>
<P>
   Paige Sauer, UConn's 6-foot-5-inch center, is still hobbling,
but she put together 13 points and 11 rebounds in 12 minutes. The
smaller St. Francis team had no one near that height to contain
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get that in our league,'' said Jen DeFilippo of St.
Francis. ``We practiced against two defenders. It's really physical
and wears you down after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth had a related problem against Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty aggressive inside,'' said 6-1 Erin Rewalt of
Dartmouth. ``It was a lot of pushing and shoving going on, a lot
more than in our league. We were just excited to play people that
size.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Stringer, the Rutgers coach, was excited that her team
started safely in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was important,'' she said, ``was how we played, how we
won. We opened all the barrels and ran and saw each other and won
the boards. And we're capable of playing intense, focused
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Stringer, in her 27th year as a highly successful head coach,
has changed with the times. While her team concept remains unbowed,
she is more tolerant of occasional playground showboating.
</P>
<P>
   Her team has depth, and that may become a factor. Shawnetta
Stewart, a quick forward who can shoot from anywhere, played only
one minute in the second half against Dartmouth because of a jammed
right index finger. Tasha Pointer, the quick point guard, was
slowed by a contusion of the left calf.
</P>
<P>
   With the game in hand early in the second half, Stringer
substituted liberally, and she did not seem concerned with
Dartmouth's mild comeback. Dartmouth also started getting better
shots. As Chris Wielgus, the Dartmouth coach, said, ``We took good
shots that didn't fall.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first row on the sideline, Gov. Christie Whitman of New
Jersey, wearing a red Rutgers sweater, cheered on the state
university's team. After the game, she told Stringer the game was
``a nice warm-up for Rutgers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't go so far as to say nice warm-up,'' the coach said
later, ``but a nice opportunity to play a team that played spirited
and hard. I was very nervous before the game, but we appreciate the
governor's supreme confidence.''

STANDING PAT, THE KNICKS LOSE GROUND 
ADVICE FOR MARBURY 
CLIPPERS MUST LEARN TO SHARE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry West, the Los Angeles Lakers' president and architect,
entered the season with a team that might already have been
championship-bound. Now, with the prompting of the Lakers' owner,
Jerry Buss, West has made several major personnel moves to improve
their chances.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, anyhow, signing Dennis Rodman and trading for Glen
Rice in the last two weeks appear to give the Lakers the inside
track for a title.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, the New York Knicks, a large-market team
with disposable income essentially stood pat at the league's
trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   And now they have lost six of their last eight games after
Friday night's debacle in Chicago in which they matched a league
low for field goals in a game with 19. They are losing ground to
Indiana and Miami and may be hard-pressed to catch Orlando in the
Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were stunned when Stephon Marbury wound up with the
New Jersey Nets. Although the Knicks inquired about him, they were
never seriously in the running for Marbury, simply because they did
not have a grade-A point guard to tantalize anyone with.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how serious the Knicks were about Marbury, coach Jeff Van
Gundy said: ``It doesn't matter. He's in New Jersey. The bottom
line is, they did a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that Latrell Sprewell is adjusting to his new
teammates, that Marcus Camby will justify his contract extension
and that the Knicks will regroup and be healthy enough in two
months to contend for the Eastern Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Oakley is not the only former Knick taking shots at
the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's that $50 million backcourt doing?'' a smiling Derek
Harper said late last week, referring to the combined contracts of
Chris Childs and Charlie Ward. ``I think a lot of the moves there
can be questioned. That's nothing against the players that have
signed there. If you're in line to be a free agent and you picked
up Chris, Charlie and Camby, well, more power to those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``But production is what this business is all about. And when
you produce, you win basketball games.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper, the ex-Knick whom the Lakers signed for a pittance, is
befuddled. ``After a while, you have to question Ernie,'' he said,
referring to Ernie Grunfeld, the Knicks' president and general
manager. ``You have to wonder what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Harper has a bone to pick with the Knicks after they
renounced his rights following the 1995-96 season, he says he
harbors no grudges.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Cummings is different. He has no real history with the
Knicks. He was merely a veteran power forward hoping to play for
anyone when the Knicks sent him to Golden State in the Sprewell
trade. But he, too, does not understand the method in the Garden
management's madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bring in some youth like Camby to help you in the future,
but you base your whole success around your 36-year-old franchise
center,'' Cummings said. ``Patrick has only got a couple years
left, so building for the future makes no sense for them right now.
I'm as surprised as everyone that they didn't keep Oak and everyone
together for one last run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, getting younger and more athletic doesn't always
necessarily mean you're getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they signed Camby for a contract that could total $48
million, the Knicks already had the league's highest payroll at $64
million. If they do not advance past the second round of the
playoffs, more people than former Knicks are going to wonder if
that money could have been spent more wisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read Oak's quote about changing for nothing else but the
sake of change,'' Harper said. ``It's perfect. You want to tell me
they haven't missed Oak this year? How many minutes has Marcus
Camby averaged this year?''
</P>
<P>
   Camby was averaging 18.9 minutes in 18 games entering Friday
night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Harper it was not fair to compare West and Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry has been doing it a lot longer and he's the best there
is,'' Harper said. ``Ernie is Ernie and Jerry is Jerry. I don't
think there's a lot of comparison there.'' &QL;

<P>
   Advice for Marbury
</P>
<P>
   Another New York schoolboy legend came home to play on Thursday,
another young star who can dribble, pass, shoot and perform under
pressure. The possibilities seem limitless for Stephon Marbury,
just as they did for an earlier Nets point guard from the city's
playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my best advice is not to let his friends and family
dictate his life just because he's home,'' said Kenny Anderson, the
28-year-old floor leader of the Boston Celtics who spent four and a
half turbulent seasons in the Meadowlands. ``It's very hard to stay
focused like that. Really, I'm just learning it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Stephon has an advantage. He's more mature than I was
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury has been following in Anderson's footsteps since high
school. Anderson starred at Archbishop Molloy in Queens, while
Marbury became the nation's most coveted player at Lincoln High
School in Brooklyn. Like Anderson, Marbury enrolled at Georgia Tech
and stayed only one season before leaving for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was drafted by the Nets; Marbury spent his first two
and a half seasons at Minnesota before coming to the Nets on
Thursday in a trade that became a game of musical chairs for
veteran point guards. Terrell Brandon went to Minnesota and Sam
Cassell wound up in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury came home, which, Anderson now realizes, is not always a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think going to the Nets will be easier than going to the
Knicks,'' Anderson said, referring to one of several other teams
that were interested in Marbury, ``because they want to win a
championship right now. The pressure is on. In New Jersey, they're
just hoping to make the playoffs. But there will be some major
distractions involved, no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson alternated between awesome and inconsistent with the
Nets, being selected to the All-Star team with Derrick Coleman in
1993 but ultimately failing to become a cornerstone for a franchise
that seemed to be on the rise in the early 1990s. That failure had
to do with both injuries and with Anderson's struggle to keep his
professional and personal lives separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell Stephon to make sure he uses aliases in hotels
and to concentrate on basketball as much as he can,'' Anderson
said. ``When I first heard about it, I was like, `Oh, man, he's
going back to Brooklyn.' I felt good for him. But then I remembered
the other side of it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to give you VIP tickets to this and that, ask
you to attend certain parties. You've really got to watch out.
Everybody's not your friend. Everybody's not in it for your best
interests.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clippers Must Learn to Share
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the facts that their owner will not invest money to keep
good players, their home court is the eyesore of the NBA and the
phone system in their main office often does not work, the Los
Angeles Clippers are terrible this season for an age-old basketball
reason: selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the players on the active roster will be free
agents. To secure better deals next season and escape the vortex of
the dreadful 1-18 franchise, some of those players have decided
that their own numbers will bring them more rewards than team
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, but that's the situation a lot of guys are in,''
said Maurice Taylor, the starting power forward, who scored 13
points in the Clippers' 106-92 victory over Sacramento on Thursday
night. ``It's like, I can understand part of it. But I also think
teams want winners, people that play the right roles and
contribute. We haven't totally understood that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Douglas, the veteran point guard, said: ``I've never
seen anything like it. Some guys are definitely looking out for
themselves before the team.''

 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Construction workers are building a foundation for a
455-room Doubletree Hotel in Times Square, but unlike most
foundation work, this is going on almost 200 feet in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The redevelopment of the Times Square area is producing some
unconventional structures, none more so than the building on the
south side of 42nd Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, that
will have 13 levels in its base, plus the hotel on the roof. The
$290 million project will include stores, restaurants and a
25-screen movie theater capable of seating 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   As an opening move for the development, the 7.4-million-pound
Empire Theater was picked up last year from where it had sat since
being completed in 1912 and moved 180 feet west to serve as the
entrance to the new AMC cinemas.
</P>
<P>
   The developer of the project, Forest City Ratner Cos. of
Brooklyn, had first envisioned building just an entertainment
complex on the site, but when more money became available for the
project, the company decided to put the hotel on the roof. So the
project had to be redesigned, but the addition of the
60-million-pound structure on top of the 41st Street side of the
lower building posed substantial challenges for the architects and
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   In a conventional building, a grid of support columns runs from
the base to the top, and the weight of the structure is spread
among them.
</P>
<P>
   But movie theaters cannot have columns blocking sight lines, and
without them, all that weight on the roof would be sitting over a
lot of empty space. In addition, the 41st Street side of the
complex incorporates the historic Liberty Theater, which amounts to
another hollow box in the structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotel sits on top of a confusing array of spaces,'' said
Frederick Bland, a partner in Beyer Blinder Belle, the principal
architects. ``It's an incredible Swiss cheese with all those
holes.''
</P>
<P>
   The E-Walk development of Tishman Realty and Construction across
42nd Street faced many similar problems because a 10-story annex to
a hotel to be built on that site, the Westin New York at Times
Square, will sit on top of a 13-screen cinema. But the problem was
not as severe because the top of E-Walk is about 100 feet high,
about half that at the Ratner project.
</P>
<P>
   Forest City Ratner chief executive Bruce Ratner described the
construction of his project as ``a very complicated, hard job.''
But with hotels in Manhattan as close to full as they can get,
adding the hotel was financially attractive, despite the
engineering and construction difficulties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to support the weight and other forces acting on
the hotel was to build a massive 1,500-ton steel truss similar to
the exposed beams at the Port Authority bus terminal across Eighth
Avenue as the foundation. The truss will support the hotel and
shift its weight to the few vertical columns available, then
directly to the sturdy bedrock that supports most buildings in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Because not many columns went all the way from the top to the
ground, larger columns were substituted, even at the cost of
intruding on theater spaces. ``It was difficult enough to arrange
columns without that behemoth on top,'' Bland said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he said, the bigger columns were fitted in. ``We
were able to do it and still accommodate the theaters,'' he said.
``We did lose some seats, but it was within the range that AMC
could live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of recent changes in the city's building code, the
designers also had to protect against the possibility of an
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   That requirement had serious implications for a building that
will be more than 425 feet high at its peak. If the ground were to
move in an earthquake, engineers said, the hotel at the top of the
structure would act like an inverted pendulum, trying to swing in
response to the shaking. Engineers say the new building code forced
them to add bulk to the foundation structure, though not to change
the basic design.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its exotic underpinning, the 25-story hotel will be
utterly conventional in design and built of reinforced concrete,
the most commonly used building material in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Guests of the hotel will have no way of knowing that the whole
building sits on only eight steel columns and a reinforced concrete
wall that runs to the ground on the west side, because everything
will be enclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will they know that 13 feet on the east side of the hotel
has been extended from the last supporting column, with no columns
directly underneath. There is no reason they should they care,
since the design and specifications have been inspected and
approved by city agencies, said Robert Sanna, Forest City Ratner's
director of construction.
</P>
<P>
   The components of the foundation are hulking. One of the two
major truss structures in the foundation weighs 750,000 pounds. It
will be fastened to the building by 8,400 pounds of bolts. In all,
the foundation weighs about 3 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   When working with components of this size, high up in the air,
engineers try to leave as little to chance as possible. The
components were cut, drilled, welded and fitted together at a
factory in Toronto before being taken apart for shipment to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the components were so heavy that they required both
cranes operating at the site to lift them, a tricky undertaking,
especially when the cranes have to turn in unison to swing the
components into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little late to find out in the field that bolt holes
are not in alignment,'' said Jeffrey Smilow, project manager for
Ysrael A. Seinuk, the structural engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Smilow said components were being bolted together rather than
welded because of the difficulty of controlling the quality of
welding in an open air setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what a bolt will do,'' he said. ``With field welding
you could end up with cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said engineers had to carefully isolate the Liberty Theater.
``There is a compatibility issue here,'' he said. ``This building
has a steel frame, while the Liberty is largely brick. If they were
connected, the Liberty would be ripped apart by the movement of the
steel.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was fabricated by Canron Construction, the same
company that built the supports for the platform over the Franklin
D. Roosevelt Drive that permitted the expansion of New York
Hospital. According to executives on the project, the company is
one of the few that can handle a project of this magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get a lot of bidders on a job like this,'' Ratner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the steel was bought from mills in North
America, some of the components called for were so thick that no
mill on this side of the Atlantic Ocean could supply them, said
Graeme Duff, Canron's manager for the project. ``We had to get them
from Luxembourg,'' he said. He said the beams weighed 750 pounds
per linear foot, compared to a few hundred pounds per foot for
typical construction columns.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the hotel and the cinema, the development will
include a Madame Tussaud's wax museum; an HMV music store; Just for
Feet, an athletic-shoe store that will have a basketball
half-court, and fast-food and cafe-style restaurants operated by
Host Marriott Services.
</P>
<P>
   The store and movie screens are scheduled to open later this
year, while the hotel is scheduled to open next year.

NFL OWNERS READY TO DISCUSS OFFICIATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was a game against Miami back in the early '70s,'' recalled
Ralph Wilson, 80, for 39 years owner of the Buffalo Bills, spinning
a tale with dancing, colorful wit, wisdom and inflection that few
can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercury Morris fumbled and one of our defensive ends fell on
the ball,'' Wilson recalled. ``In doing so, the officials ruled he
pushed one of their crew and slapped us with a 15-yard penalty and
gave the ball back to the Dolphins! We were getting back into the
game, and that killed us! Miami went on to score and win. I didn't
like it. I said so afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got 10 G's for that one.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Pete Rozelle, then commissioner of the National Football
League, who fined Wilson $10,000 for disparaging remarks about NFL
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, for only the second time in his nearly four decades
of pro football, Wilson was fined again, this time by Paul
Tagliabue, the current NFL commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   It was in a late-November game, Buffalo at New England, and as
the final seconds ticked away, on New England's desperation pass
into the end zone, Buffalo was called for pass interference. There
was pushing and shoving aplenty by players for both teams on the
play, and usually no penalty is called in that situation. This
time, it was. New England was awarded the ball near the goal line,
scored a touchdown and won, 25-21.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Wilson said things like, ``We got robbed!'' and
``It's awful!'' and ``That was a jump ball, and how is it our guys
were interfering!'' and ``Horrible!''
</P>
<P>
   He got fined 50 G's for that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, $50,000? Inflation, I guess,'' Wilson cracked this week.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson hopes to have the last say. NFL owners meet this week in
Phoenix in their annual spring meeting and officiating and instant
replay will command center stage. Wilson leads a group of owners
who are expected to bring replay back to the NFL for the 1999
season. There is growing discontent with officiating _ too many
rules, too many bad calls, too many game-swinging bad calls _
owners and coaches say. Enough discontent to bring back replay
after a seven-year absence. It was last used from the 1986 through
1991 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been anti-instant replay,'' said Wilson, ``but
...''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed. Thinking of last season _ the New England game, and
the Jets game when Vinny Testaverde scored a game-ending,
game-winning, phantom touchdown on a run in which he actually did
not cross the goal line _ made him want to cry. Both games were
Bills losses, and both easily could have been Bills victories. Both
games cost Buffalo a chance to play its first-round playoff game at
home. Instead, the Bills played on the road, at Miami, and lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officiating last year and really the last couple of years
has helped to change my mind,'' Wilson said. ``If an offensive
lineman breathes, it's called motion. The officiating needs to be
simplified and streamlined. And it's not just calls against us. We
benefited in a game last year where they called pass interference,
and the ball was 10 feet over the head of the receiver and the
defensive back. No way it was going to be caught by us, but there
was the flag. Replay cannot correct all of these things, but it's a
start. I'm for it _ now, let's see what kind of system we're
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk is that the owners will be presented a replay system
tied to challenges. A team would receive two challenges a game and
extra challenges in the final two minutes of each half. The referee
makes the final decision on the challenge. If the call is upheld,
the team that requested the challenge loses a timeout. If the call
is overturned, the team that makes the challenge does not lose a
timeout. In the final two minutes, an official upstairs can halt
play and ask for a review of a play and the referee will again make
the final call.
</P>
<P>
   This system, or some variation of it, seems certain to pass.
Approval will require 24 of the 31 owners' votes.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, though, says beware.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go into one of these meetings there is no such thing
as a lock,'' he said. ``There is no sure thing. I've gone into a
few of these where everything looked certain and everybody left
saying, `What happened?'''
</P>
<P>
   The owners this week are expected to consider approval of the
Washington Redskins sale for $800 million to real estate magnate
Howard Milstein and to award the league's 32nd franchise to either
Houston or Los Angeles. Los Angeles is the front-runner, where two
groups in the city are vying for ownership.
</P>
<P>
   A testy vote might occur on the idea of rotating the
Thanksgiving Day games to several teams around the league rather
than allowing current host cities Detroit and Dallas alone to
continue the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said: ``What I've seen happen in the last 10 years has
taken away too much tradition in the NFL. Why are we trying to
shred away the last bit we have? I strongly disapprove of this. The
fans in Detroit, in particular, go to this game and sell it out
every year despite the team's record. Families take their kids and
have been doing so for years. It's more than a game there. Moving
it is a bad idea.''

SPORTS COLUMN: COACHES IN THE COLLEGE RANKS FEEL EACH OTHER'S PAIN
 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GEORGE VESCEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ For the poor, beleaguered basketball coach, it's always
something.
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't a virus, it's a very visible simian perched on the
shoulder of Jim Calhoun, who coached on wobbly legs Saturday while
his Connecticut team routed New Mexico, 78-56, in the second round
of the national college basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut goes around with its own personal monkey leering at
the world, reminding people that the campus in rural Storrs is
psychologically much closer to Fenway Park in Boston than Yankee
Stadium in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun personifies Bambino terror because his Huskies have not
yet made it to the Final Four, which is apparently the only public
measure of worth in this haunted business.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can win and win, but people will say, `He's never won the
big one,''' said Nolan Richardson of Arkansas, grinding Calhoun's
ax instead of his own for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the heck is the big one?'' Richardson asked, blaming the
rising demands on ``a six-pack of beer and talk radio,'' a lethal
and common blend, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   All coaches know angst, or so it seems. Ron Jirsa was fired by
Georgia the other day after only two seasons, and his colleagues
are upset. And Clem Haskins has to go back to Minnesota to confront
a scandal after a former academic adviser told a highly credible
tale of supplying term papers and taking examinations for 20 of our
noble scholar-athletes.
</P>
<P>
   It is a quaint custom, this doing one's own work. In these
Internet days, a huge percentage of any student body undoubtedly
downloads somebody else's interpretation of Hamlet, but only the
scholarship player is accused as publicly as four Minnesota players
were before a loss to Gonzaga on Thursday. They sat out the game,
which is a context clue that the university suspects the charges
just might be true.
</P>
<P>
   Haskins says he didn't know anything. Never handled the money.
Never saw the papers. Wasn't there. Didn't see. This stance may
qualify him to replace Juan Antonio Samaranch as president of the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The four senior citizens in Saturday's doubleheader all seemed
to agree that theirs is a thankless occupation. Calhoun, 56, is
tired of talking about the Final Four. Dave Bliss of New Mexico,
55, was brooding that he often has to coach against the collective
wisdom of the entire community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players all have their entourages,'' Bliss said the other
day. ``They've got parents, guardians, soul mates and summer
coaches, and they're all blowing smoke. The players don't know
which coach to listen to. We call it `the self-esteem gap.' It's
not a good situation in college basketball right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches in the second game had their own gloomy outlook. Tom
Davis, 60, went into the game against Arkansas knowing that he had
exactly one more loss left in his career at Iowa. The athletic
director made a few rambling comments about why he was dumping
Davis, but the coach has taken the high road _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing what I've done for 13 years in terms of trying to
develop the program, a clean program that is respected around the
country for playing by the rules with good guys _ stuff like
that,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who would coach against Davis Saturday, took the
firing personally. Richardson always takes things personally. He
believes himself to be part of an endangered species of aging coach
that he calls ``cowboys.'' Richardson hails, after all, from out in
the west Texas town of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Even as secure and establishment a figure as Dean Smith
qualified in Richardson's pantheon of cowboys. So does ``Doctor
Tom'' Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches like Tom, myself, John Thompson, John Chaney _ to me,
those are the cowboys,'' Richardson said on Friday. ``Our days are
numbered. But are the numbered ones as bad as the ones coming
behind them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm the age I am at,'' said Richardson, who is 57.
``I'm glad I don't have to look over my shoulder at some little
young A.D. who's come to fire me. Some of them are hired to fire
you, and then they get fired themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Richardson was less morbid than usual because he had
won a victory earlier in the week when the NCAA's system of
admission standards was challenged by a court decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun because of Proposition 16,'' Richardson said,
perhaps envisioning a new millennium of each school setting its own
standards for entrance to higher education, which sounds like pure
anarchy rather than the ordered world that coaches profess to
respect.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson himself wishes more people would admire the high
calling of coaching. He has the fantasy of asking a surgeon buddy
of his if he can wield the scalpel in the operating room, the same
way people think they can coach better than he can. Or he envisions
himself chatting up the captain of an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, baby, let me fly this plane,'' Richardson said he
imagines himself saying. ``It's all right. I read the manual.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson added, ``The 140 people in the plane would think I'm
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   No more crazy, of course, than civilians thinking they could
make a better game plan than Richardson. It's always something.

OUTDOORS: THE PLEASURE OF TYING FLIES AS SPRING NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the land emerging from March's brutal embrace, this is the
ideal time for fly tying.
</P>
<P>
   Hooks, fur, feathers, tinsel, thread and floss arranged on your
desk, you can sit at your fly-tying vise, and _ as your creations
blossom under your fingers _ indulge in thoughts of the delights
that lie ahead when the soft days of the fifth month arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Because certain patterns of commercially tied fishing flies sell
for more than $5 each, economics often plays a significant role in
such endeavors. Home-tied flies cost only a fraction of the
store-bought ones if you don't count your labor, and if you have
been a serious fly fisher for a long time, you will probably have
scores, even hundreds, of flies in your possession, some for trout
or Atlantic salmon, some for fresh water black bass or pan fish and
still others for salt-water species such as striped bass, bluefish
and Atlantic bonito.
</P>
<P>
   Catching fish with self-tied flies is the major thrill awaiting
practitioners of this gentle craft, but there is solid satisfaction
in filling your fly books and fly boxes with row upon row of
handsome new creations arranged by size, type and intended quarry.
It is akin to ordering seeds and plants for your garden when frost
is still in the ground. It will also be the one time in the year
when your flies are properly organized. When you are actually
fishing, which always involves some changing or replacing of flies
and swift reactions to shifts in weather, available light or the
feeding patterns of your prey, the excitement of the endeavor will
conspire to create chaos out of order.
</P>
<P>
   You would be wise to concentrate on one or two patterns at each
tying session. Failing that, you will wind up with a bewildering
welter of materials and hooks on your desk. Each pattern requires
special technique _ whether winding on hackle, spinning deer hair
for a head or matching feathers for wings _ and it's best to tie at
least a dozen of each until the drill becomes automatic.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a beginner, you will, after fashioning a few of the
standard patterns described in step-by-step illustrations in your
just-bought fly-tying text, begin to think that you are ready to
invent something of your own. You aren't, but don't let that deter
you. It's a syndrome that every neophyte tier experiences.
</P>
<P>
   A few months or years later when the madness has departed you
will look at the melange of dreadful objects that you tucked away
on a shelf after they took few or no fish, and wonder how you could
have been so foolish. There are hundreds of recognized fly patterns
_ most of them for trout _ and it takes a certain amount of
audacity to think that you can devise yet another.
</P>
<P>
   But as the years pass, you may reach a stage wherein you are
equipped through experience to develop a fly of your own, although
its fame may not extend beyond your circle of friends or your
region. Few will come up with a fly that takes the country by storm
as did Don Gapen's Muddler Minnow.
</P>
<P>
   Some fly tiers learn that they do not possess the dexterity or
the patience to fashion truly small dry flies for trout. The hooks
for these flies, Nos. 22 or 24, are so tiny that two dozen of them
will fit on a postage stamp. If this applies to you, don't fret.
Tie the larger flies and purchase the smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
   While actually fishing, you will discover that minor changes in
recognized patterns _ perhaps a different butt or tail _ will
sometimes produce salubrious results. This is particularly true
with Atlantic salmon and trout. And there's also the matter of
sparseness. Under some circumstances, a fly pattern known to be
effective may not catch many fish if it is heavily-dressed, meaning
it's tied with an amplitude, rather than a paucity, of the
materials called for. A sparsely-tied fly will often elicit strikes
when its fuller counterpart on the same size hook is ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Never, by the way, think that choosing the right fly is the only
key to successful fly fishing. Your presentation of a fly to the
fish is sometimes more important than its pattern. Fish are
opportunists, programmed to make instantaneous decisions on whether
to grab some passing morsel.
</P>
<P>
   It often happens that an artificial fly bearing little
resemblance to the critters upon which the fish has been gorging is
snatched up when it passes the quarry's field of vision in a
different and tantalizing manner. This is also a warning against
changing flies after every half-dozen nonproductive casts. No fly
will catch fish if it isn't in the water.
</P>
<P>
   As the seasons roll past, the fly tier accumulates substantial
quantities of fur, body hair, deer and squirrel tails, feathers and
hackle, which are stored, properly moth-proofed, in boxes and
bureau drawers. Some were purchased, but others might have been
gathered while hunting or taken from animals that failed to safely
negotiate highways. Gifts of such materials will also come your way
and when you put them on your fly tying desk you are reminded of
happy fishing trips with their donors.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago I began to tie some flies for striped bass. I
commonly use bucktail for this, but then I remembered that I had
been given a swatch of long and lustrous polar bear hair by Harold
``Buster'' Welch of Winnipeg, Manitoba, a few years ago after we
went fishing together for stripers off the beaches of Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   I have been hoarding it because it is unusually difficult to
obtain, but this spring I shall fashion at least a dozen polar bear
streamers and think fondly of Buster when the first striper hits
and doggedly bores offshore in the heaving, nighttime waters of
Vineyard Sound.

LOWELL FULSON, WHO TOOK TEXAS-STYLE BLUES TO THE WEST COAST, DIES
AT 77  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Okl. , Calif.)   By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lowell Fulson, a major figure in West Coast blues, died March 6
in Long Beach, Calif. He was 77 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from kidney disease, diabetes and
congestive heart failure, said his companion, Tina Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Fulson took the smooth, jazz-tinged jump-blues of Texas to
California, where he had rhythm-and-blues hits from the 1940s to
the 60s. He wrote songs that were also recorded by Elvis Presley
(``Reconsider Baby''), Otis Redding and Carla Thomas (``Tramp'')
and B.B. King (``Three O'Clock Blues''). He was a member of the
Blues Hall of Fame and the Rhythm-and-Blues Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Fulson was born in 1921 on a Choctaw Indian reservation in
Oklahoma; his grandfather was a Choctaw. Fulson played gospel and
country music before turning to the blues. In 1939 he replaced
Chester Burnett (later known as Howlin' Wolf) in the band led by
the country-blues singer Texas Alexander, who was based in
Gainesville, Texas. He served two years in the Navy in Oakland,
Calif., and stayed on the West Coast when he began his recording
career in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   He had his first rhythm-and-blues hit, ``Three O'Clock Blues,''
on the Swingtime label in 1948, and went on tour in 1950 with a
band that included Ray Charles on piano. Other bands Fulson led
would include Ike Turner on guitar and Stanley Turrentine or King
Curtis on tenor saxophone. He continued to have hits, including a
version of Memphis Slim's ``Nobody Loves Me'' that he retitled
``Everyday I Have the Blues,'' and his own song, ``Blue Shadows,''
in 1950. Although he lived in California, he began recording for
the Chicago-based Checker label (part of Chess Records) in 1954,
when he had a hit with ``Reconsider Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   He moved in 1964 to Kent Records, recording as Lowell Fulsom,
and his soul-styled ``Tramp'' reached No. 5 on the rhythm-and-blues
chart in 1967. He continued to tour and record well into the 1990s,
with albums for European labels and, most recently, for the Rounder
and Bullseye Blues labels. He won five W.C. Handy blues awards in
1993 and his 1995 album, ``Them Update Blues'' (Bullseye Blues),
was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues album.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Mayfield, he is survived by a sister, Norvell
Larney of Oklahoma; a brother, Jack Stewart; two sons, Lowell Jr.
and Richard; two daughters, Yvonne Penna and Edna Fulson, and 13
grandchildren, all of Los Angeles.

TRYING TO SAVE A BANKRUPT TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once again, Mario Lemieux was the center, moving
forward with purpose and with teammates on each wing. But this was
not a comeback for the retired hockey star who left the game too
soon because of injuries and illness. Instead of wearing Pittsburgh
Penguins uniforms and carrying hockey sticks, these men wore
business suits and carried briefcases. Instead of crossing ice,
they moved over the sidewalks of midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Like many fellow pedestrians, they were on a shopping trip last
Thursday afternoon, but not for clothing, jewelry, appliances or a
better apartment. Lemieux and his men hoped to buy a hockey team,
the Penguins, a bankrupt franchise worth about $100 million but
owing more than that in debt. Inside those briefcases was the
paperwork representing the money. At age 33, a Hall of Famer who
wore No. 66 wants to run a team in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit scary,'' Lemieux said of his venture into
big business. ``But we feel we have a great chance in Pittsburgh
for a fresh start. We feel we have a great chance to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is also scary, for Lemieux and for Pittsburgh.
Because the current ownership, led by Roger Marino, has filed for
bankruptcy, Lemieux could lose much of the $31 million the Penguins
still owe him in deferred salary. He retired in 1997 after two
Stanley Cups, two back surgeries and a recovery from Hodgkin's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Marino has also requested permission from the federal bankruptcy
court to shop the franchise to other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be back before the judge this week. Lemieux and
his lawyers were on their way to meet with Gary Bettman, the
commissioner of the National Hockey League. Bettman also heard
presentations from two other groups last Thursday, including
Marino's.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux wants to convert part of the money owed to him into a
share of the franchise ownership. Lemieux said he has recruited
other investors who will put up additional financing, between $40
million and $50 million. If Lemieux can convince both the NHL.and
the judge that his money and his intentions are sound, he could
become, in a few months, the controlling owner of the same
franchise he led to Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the hockey side of it,'' Lemieux said, when asked about
his ownership qualifications. ``I've always been able to surround
myself with some smart people over the years.'' He said Craig
Patrick, the current general manager, ``is one of the best.'' And
he added: ``We have a good coaching staff, a pretty good young
team. The future looks good.''
</P>
<P>
   But who will provide the money? Lemieux said he has put together
a group of backers, including a single significant investor he
refers to only as Mr. Wonderful. The identity of the investor will
be revealed eventually, Lemieux said, but certainly not before
Lemieux and his group present their plan to the bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux emphasized that the man is a sound investor, but the NHL
has a troubled recent history with mysterious investors. A few
years ago, the Islanders were purchased by a mystery man named John
Spano. When it turned out that Spano did not have the money he said
he had, Spano lost the franchise and ended up in jail. Isn't
Lemieux a friend of Spano?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was,'' Lemieux said, stressing the past tense of the verb.
Spano is not the only embarrassment the league has had recently on
the ownership level. Bruce McNall, the former chairman of the board
of governors and the owner who brought Wayne Gretzky to Los
Angeles, also went to jail for financial fraud. The Tampa Bay
Lightning recently got its third ownership in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league has to be careful who they deal with,'' Lemieux
said. ``They got fooled a couple times.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Greenberg, one of Lemieux's lawyers, said Lemieux's group
has an advantage over the Marino group and the other prospective
ownership group because Lemieux's image in Pittsburgh will rally
fans, investors and politicians to the cause of saving the
franchise. Television deals and arena leases may need reworking and
the team wants a new arena to replace the current building, which
is more than 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current regime no longer has the good will necessary to
pull the different segments of the community together to turn the
situation around,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Lemieux represents the cachet, not the cash.
``This franchise is worth considerably more if Mario is the
principal owner,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux was asked about the way Marino handled the business
affairs of the Penguins in his two years of ownership. Did Lemieux
feel betrayed?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed in the way they handled the whole
situation,'' Lemieux said. ``He just decided not to pay anybody.
After 12 years of giving everything I had for the franchise, I felt
that I was cheated a little bit. That's Roger Marino. That's his
character. That's just the way he is. That's the way he does
business. He tries to bully everybody because he has a lot of
money. It just didn't work out in Pittsburgh. We stood up to him
and that's why he had to go into bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   A call to Marino for comment was not returned. Following the day
of meetings with the three groups trying to take control of the
team, the NHL issued a statement from William Daly, senior vice
president for legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are satisfied that substantial progress has been made,''
Daly's statement said. ``Although there remain certain significant
conditions that will need to be satisfied, we understand that
parties are continuing to work to resolve those remaining issues.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux said Bettman ``has been very supportive'' but added,
``He has to wait and see if we're for real, if we have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   In that he is five years younger than players like Gretzky, Mark
Messier and Ray Bourque, is it possible that Lemieux would make a
comeback and become a player/owner? ``I have no plan on coming
back, even if I get no money,'' said Lemieux, who scored 613 goals
in 745 games over a 12-year career. ``I've been through a lot, with
the cancer and the back surgeries. To get back and play with these
guys would be torture.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last few seasons, Lemieux was harshly critical of the
league for allowing obstruction tactics to nullify the skills of
great players. Although goal-scoring is still low, about 5.3 goals
a game, Lemieux is among those hockey observers who think new rules
have improved the level of play for the most talented players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's showing,'' he said. ``It's very exciting for the fans and
the players.''
</P>
<P>
   With the league expanding from 27 teams to 30 teams in the next
two seasons, does Lemieux think there is enough talent to stock so
many teams?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of talent out there, especially in Europe,''
Lemieux said. ``And there are good players coming out of Canada and
colleges in the States.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the contention of some owners that high salaries are
jeopardizing the financial infrastructure of the business?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a lot of upside to it in the future,''
Lemieux said. ``We feel we have a good chance to be successful.
Franchises appreciate every year tremendously. That's the upside.
The top players should make a lot of money. They are the ones who
bring people into the buildings. They make the business what it is
today and they should be paid accordingly. I'm not so sure about
the lower-tier players who score a few goals a year and make two or
three million dollars a year. That eventually will have to change,
I would assume.''

LANDOWNERS RESIST PLANS FOR A WETLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DEBRA WEST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 30 years, Lucille Lapenta leased her waterfront back yard on
the Hudson River in Nyack, N.Y., to a neighbor who ran a small
shipyard on his own property and needed extra land. When the
neighbor abandoned the shipyard more than a decade ago, the dock
fell into decay. The barge that had served as a machine shop caught
fire, and a charred hull was left at the water's edge. The boat
sheds rotted and were bulldozed into an unsightly heap.
</P>
<P>
   The mess does not bother Mrs. Lapenta, who is 97 and has lived
along the river for most of this century. But it troubles community
leaders, who want to revitalize Nyack's waterfront and hope to draw
more tourists to the village of antiques shops, stylish restaurants
and charming Victorian homes.
</P>
<P>
   Village officials want to turn the property into a wetland and
bird sanctuary that would be closed to the public but visible from
an adjacent park. The village has already received $289,000 in
state grants to study whether paint scrapings, varnish, motor oil
and other chemicals from the former boat yard are contaminating the
river.
</P>
<P>
   But to achieve its goals and begin the study, the village must
buy much of Mrs. Lapenta's back yard, and a strip of the back yards
of her two adjacent neighbors. None want to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here so long, and we had it to ourselves,'' Mrs.
Lapenta said last week, looking past the shoreline ruins to the
graceful span of the Tappan Zee Bridge. ``They want to take all our
land. We'd have nothing if they take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Village Board has scheduled a public hearing for April 28 on
condemning the properties and seizing them by eminent domain, which
is the right of a government to take private property for public
use after compensating the owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Condemnation is like amputation,'' said Mayor Terry Hekker.
``Nobody thinks it's a good idea on its own, only when it's for the
good of the greater body. We have 7,000 people in the village and
22,000 in the surrounding communities, and all of these people have
an interest in the waterfront.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the Hudson was considered a polluted liability,
lined with railroad tracks and factories. Now, with manufacturing
gone and the river cleaner along the lower Hudson Valley, towns see
the shoreline as their best asset. Nearly every community in the
valley has its own version of a South Street Seaport planned.
</P>
<P>
   All this excitement is a curiosity to Mrs. Lapenta, who
emigrated from Italy and settled in Nyack at age 11 and was always
too busy working to pay the river much attention.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lapenta and her husband, William, who died in 1971, ran a
grocery store in Nyack. She had no interest in boating or fishing,
and after a polio scare associated with river water in the 1930s,
she did not allow her children to swim in the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   But she always liked to look eastward at the river from her
house, which has a comfortable, fenced-in back yard that is about
25 feet above the land that the village plans to seize. Mrs.
Lapenta said she thought that the value of the tiny house she had
lived in since 1925 hinged on its access to the river.
</P>
<P>
   A small house up the street, with riverfront access, recently
sold for $600,000, said Mrs. Lapenta's son Rocco, 71. He said he
thought that her property was worth a similar amount and was
surprised when the village's appraisal found that the entire
property, with house, was worth just $290,000. The village offered
Mrs. Lapenta $40,000 for the portion of the back yard along the
river.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was an insult, said Mrs. Lapenta's daughter, Doris
Rion, 69, who lives across the street from her mother. She said the
family had offered to pay for the removal of the debris and the
sagging dock. The family is not convinced that there are
significant levels of contaminants in the soil, Mrs. Rion said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents worked their whole lives for this,'' she added.
``To give it up for a wetland, for a bird sanctuary, it doesn't
seem right. We're willing to clean it up. It should be cleaned up.
But it's my mother's.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Lapenta's neighbors, Deborah Mann and Louis Spitz, never
had riverfront access and are only involved in the battle because
of an arcane state law.
</P>
<P>
   Their houses sit on the same hill as Mrs. Lapenta's, and the
half-acre shoreline property that starts at the base of that hill
contains the abandoned shipyard, which now belongs to the state.
The state planned to sell the property to the village, but state
laws give Ms. Mann and Spitz, as the nearest inland property
owners, the right of first refusal for state-owned shoreline
property. They declined to waive those rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mann said she did not trust village leaders to clean up the
site. ``Whether they are able to complete the mission is
questionable to me,'' she said. ``Things get started here and don't
get finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the village intends to seize a 1-foot-deep strip from Ms.
Mann's and Spitz's properties so that Nyack becomes the nearest
inland owner and is then entitled to buy the abandoned shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hekker said she was dumbfounded by the homeowners' refusal
to release their claim on the land so that it could be cleaned. ``I
think we are improving the value of their property,'' she said.
``As it is, if they wanted to sell it, nobody could get a mortgage
on that property.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the cleanup could cost from $1 million to $5 million,
which she hoped the state would cover with environmental bond act
money.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledges that if the village does not take title to the
property by July, $267,000 of the grant money for the environmental
study must be returned and the cleanup plan will probably be
scuttled. Ms. Hekker said the village was bound by law to offer
Mrs. Lapenta no more than the appraised value for the land.
</P>
<P>
   To Mrs. Lapenta, the idea of a wetland, with insects and
garbage-trapping reeds, behind her house is repellent. ``I don't
want a bunch of birds in my back yard,'' she said. ``I like birds,
but owls and all that? Please. Everything in its place.''

IN TRAVELS, DODD SPREADS WORD ABOUT COMPUTER BUG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, Conn. _ A congressional staff member calls it ``the
fine line between Paul Revere and Chicken Little.''
</P>
<P>
   Treading that line is Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut
Democrat, who is using his travels around the state and his network
television appearances to sound an alarm about the year 2000
computer problems, or ``the Y2K bug,'' a programming flaw that
could cause some computers to shut down or go crazy on New Year's
Day, potentially affecting everything from credit card transactions
to air travel.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, as vice chairman of the Senate Special Committee on the
Year 2000 Technology Problem, is trying to persuade people to make
reasonable preparations (say, keeping copies of bank statements),
without building fallout shelters and stocking up on freeze-dried
food.
</P>
<P>
   That can be tricky. There he was Feb. 28 on NBC's ``Meet the
Press,'' where the senator just smiled when the moderator, Tim
Russert, transposed the nickname and asked about ``the YK2
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd replied, ``We should be OK, but it's not unwise for people
to do a little stockpiling.'' He now says he may have got a bit
carried away with that advice, and instead tells audiences they
should simply use ``good old Yankee precaution'' by squirreling
away two or three days' worth of water and canned goods, as if they
were preparing for a hurricane or ice storm.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor who is a teacher interested him in year 2000 computer
issues back in 1996, and Dodd started urging businesses to assess
their preparedness in 1997. He recalled that for the early hearings
he convened on the topic, getting news coverage was impossible.
``People thought it was funny,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own millennial plans, Dodd said he has always had
extra soup and frozen food on hand at his home in East Haddam, and
said he is likely to celebrate New Year's Eve by renting a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dodd dropped into this Connecticut River town,
according to his schedule, to ``inspect Y2K readiness'' at
Middlesex Hospital. A report released this month by the Senate's
year 2000 committee highlighted Dodd's warning that ``Y2K could put
the health-care industry in intensive care.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a friendly visit that left Dodd pleased with
the progress in health care, one of the sectors that his research
shows is the most vulnerable to disruption on Jan. 1 if computers
act as if the year is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing for Dodd, complete with slides, the hospital's
administrators said they had determined that 88 percent of their
clinical equipment was ``year 2000 compliant,'' but noted they had
found 1,168 items they could not test _ including beds, doors and
refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very impressive,'' Dodd said. He was dismayed to hear that
some suppliers were resisting the hospital's inquiries about
whether their products had been tested for year 2000 reliability,
and said he plans to work to make such companies responsible for
any failures that result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a special place I'd like to put vendors that don't
share information,'' he said, startling some of the administrators
with his intensity. ``I think a lot of it has to do with lawyers
advising them, but these companies are deluding themselves. If they
cause any kind of a problem, they'll pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the year 2000 fallout is a major issue in
Connecticut, where the capital, Hartford, is headquarters to
several of the nation's largest insurance companies. The Senate
report quoted some estimates of a ``litigation cost in excess of $1
trillion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said he was concerned about reports that insurers had begun
adding clauses exempting year 2000 crashes from coverage, which he
said ``could bankrupt small firms'' hit by aftershocks of computer
crashes. (A spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, the
trade group of property and casualty insurers, said that most
losses caused directly by year 2000 problems would not be covered
by insurance, and that the clauses simply spelled that out.)
</P>
<P>
   Reassured that most businesses and agencies are waking up to the
year 2000 issues, Dodd is sprinkling his speeches and conversations
with a reminder to watch out for problems on Sept. 9, when
programmers say some computers could provide a preview of Jan. 1
glitches by balking at the 9/9/99 date.

GERSHON LEGMAN, ANTHOLOGIST OF EROTIC HUMOR, DIES AT 81  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, The Netherlands, Pa., N.J.)   By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gershon Legman, a self-taught scholar of dirty jokes and bawdy
limericks and ballads who played a pivotal role in opening up the
field of erotic folklore to scholarly study in the 1960s and 70s,
died on Feb. 23 at a hospital near his home in Opio, France. He was
81.
</P>
<P>
   Legman is best known as the author of a two-volume
psychoanalytic study of sexual and scatological humor titled
``Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' and as an industrious anthologist
of limericks. He also published books on violence in comic books,
oral sex and various aspects of erotic folklore.
</P>
<P>
   He accumulated what has been described as one of the world's
largest collections of published and unpublished erotic and
scatological literature, and served as a kind of intermediary for
scholars worldwide, maintaining a voluminous correspondence from
his home in a hill town on the Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   A tireless autodidact, he was credited with a role in
introducing the art of Japanese paper-folding to the West. In
interviews, he also said he had developed a vibrator in the late
1930s and coined the phrase ``Make love, not war'' during a talk at
the University of Ohio in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, after a series of strokes that began in 1991, he
left behind several unpublished manuscripts, including a two-volume
book on ballads that he had worked on for years and an
autobiography that his wife, Judith, said he had lost the desire to
complete after he became ill.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by their three children,
David, of Summit, N.J., and Rafael and Sarah, of Opio, and by his
daughter Ariela, of Amsterdam. Mrs. Legman, his wife since 1966,
said she was unsure whether their marriage was his second or third.
</P>
<P>
   The son of immigrants from Eastern Europe, Legman grew up in
Scranton, Pa. His parents, he said, expected him to become a rabbi.
But he became interested in erotica at an early age and took to
clipping racy jokes out of magazines, pasting them on index cards
and filing them by subject.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped out of college in his first semester, his wife said.
In interviews, Legman said he had traveled across the country
lecturing on contraception for organizations that promoted birth
control and being arrested for violating anti-obscenity statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he landed in New York, took a series of odd jobs and
began spending long hours at the New York Public Library,
cultivating what his wife called ``his interest in all that was
erotic and at that time completely forbidden except in medical
circles.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, he became editor of Neurotica, a short-lived
Freudian quarterly. Along with work by Allen Ginsberg, Marshall
McLuhan and others, he published his own essays attacking violence
in comic books, which later appeared in his first book, ``Love and
Death: A Study in Censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Legman questioned why children were exposed to
lurid depictions of violence but shielded from descriptions of
people making love. After publishers rejected the manuscript, he
published it himself and distributed it by mail out of his
book-cluttered house in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, the postal service stopped delivering his
mail, Legman said. So he moved to France with his first wife,
Beverly Keith, in 1953. They settled eventually on the Riviera,
having arrived one day by train and having been overwhelmed by the
sight of the bougainvillea, Judith Legman said.
</P>
<P>
   Legman's first anthology, ``The Limerick,'' appeared in France
in 1953 and later in the United States. Like much of his work, it
was encyclopedic; it contained 1,739 limericks. In 1977, Crown
Publishers published a sequel, ``The New Limerick,'' with 2,750.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' came out in 1968, published by
Grove Press. A second volume, ``No Laughing Matter: Rationale of
the Dirty Joke, 2d Series,'' appeared in 1975. In it, Legman sorted
more than 2,000 jokes into categories like ``sex and money,''
``castration'' and ``homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   In a review in Time magazine, R.Z. Sheppard called the book ``an
undeniable presence, a work of majestic ego that was weathered by
new attitudes and ideas long before completion.'' The review
continued: ``In the future, it will be plundered, measured and
thumbed through for titillation. But the book will remain
impervious in all its pocked dignity, authenticity and embattled
romanticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Legman's other books are ``The Horn Book: Studies in
Erotic Folklore and Bibliography'' and ``Oragenitalism,'' on oral
sex.
</P>
<P>
   A devotee of paper-folding, he put together a bibliography on
the topic in the early 1950s and is said to have helped initiate a
museum exhibition on origami in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Jackson, a professor of American culture at the State
University of New York at Buffalo and the author of a 1974 book on
narrative poetry from the black oral tradition, said Legman made
accessible to other scholars material that scholarly journals had
long been afraid to publish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legman is the person, more than any other, who made research
into erotic folklore and erotic verbal behavior academically
respectable,'' Jackson said. ``He's utterly famous in the world of
erotica for what he did _ for making these materials accessible by
providing them freely to anyone who asked and for finding stuff
that nobody else knew about.''

 HOSPITAL IS HAUNTED BY HISTORY OF DEALS WITH BOARD MEMBERS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORTLANDT, N.Y. _ In the early 1990s, a small nonprofit hospital
just outside Peekskill embarked on an expansion that would
transform it from a homespun but antiquated local landmark into a
regionwide medical center rated among the top 4 percent of the
nation's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But the makeover of Peekskill Community Hospital into the Hudson
Valley Hospital Center was also striking for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The architect for a new $23 million wing was Lothrop Associates,
which has among its partners Arthur Clements, who resigned from the
hospital's board of directors to perform the work. The wing's
foundation was dug for $1.4 million by a company owned by Joseph
Lois, a board member. The $2.1 million worth of plumbing work was
handled by a board member, Bruce Lindenbaum. The land for a new
birth cottage was acquired for $783,500 from Dan and Ruth Woolfe.
Mrs. Woolfe, too, was a board member.
</P>
<P>
   These entanglements were not illegal because they were fully
disclosed to other board members and cleared by a ruling from the
state attorney general. ``There was zero secrecy,'' Lois said.
</P>
<P>
   But the expansion revealed how relaxed the hospital was about
letting board members do business with it. In recent weeks that
policy has come back to haunt the hospital and its chairman from
1986 to 1996, Robert Boyle, a longtime fund-raiser for Gov. George
Pataki and now executive director of the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   A federal tax-fraud indictment last month against Albert Pirro
Jr., an influential real estate lawyer married to the popular
Westchester County district attorney, Jeanine Pirro, ensnared the
hospital and Boyle. Federal authorities assert that Boyle owned a
major stake in a Pirro company that sold a medical office building
to the hospital for $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle was not charged in the indictment and was identified only
by his hospital title, not by name. He has denied ownership in the
Pirro company, but the hospital admits that it let Boyle manage
that building's renovation, and associates of Pirro's said that
Boyle was paid $292,000 in ``finder's fees.'' Boyle, however, said
those fees were for an unrelated property.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the tangle of insular deals has illuminated a
little-known facet of nonprofit institutions: members of their
governing boards, while receiving no pay, sometimes profit from
those roles. While such arrangements are not illegal if fully
disclosed and can be beneficial by, for example, offering the
institution discounts, legal experts warn that too lax a policy can
foster a mentality of ``I'll scratch your back if you scratch my
back,'' in which board members drum up work for one another.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the number of directors involved in Hudson Valley's
renovation, John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University and
a specialist in corporate ethics, said, ``I happen to think that
that's fairly poor corporate governance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows a little too much tolerance for self-dealing,'' he
said. ``Norms of reciprocity can develop such as, `If you let my
firm be the architect, I'll let your firm be the general
contractor, and I'll let his firm sell us the property that we may
or may not need.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Coffee said that large nonprofit institutions could prohibit
such self-dealing, but with smaller organizations in less populous
locales, the universe of community leaders and contractors was
smaller and self-dealing might be more common.
</P>
<P>
   In one prominent case, the State Board of Regents removed 18 of
the 19 trustees at Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y., in 1997
after it found, among other things, that two trustees profited by
taking on the university's insurance and advertising accounts
without full disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirro indictment's references to Hudson Valley have
resonated beyond this northwestern corner of Westchester because of
the hospital's close association with Pataki. The governor served
on the board from 1988 to 1992, and many of his associates have
served there since, including Michael Finnegan, the governor's
counsel from 1995 to 1997, and two former staff members.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of so many Pataki associates is not surprising
since Pataki grew up in Peekskill and was its mayor for many years.
A hospital traditionally looks for directors who can help it raise
money, offer it expertise and influence government. Still, Hudson
Valley's board has had a particularly Republican cast, heavily
weighted with party allies and contributors. Boyle, who also grew
up in Peekskill, served as Pataki's treasurer in his races for
state Senate in 1992 and for governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Directors now on the 26-member board besides Boyle include Rose
Marie Panio, chairwoman of Yorktown's Republican committee;
Catherine Pisani, a Republican councilwoman in Peekskill, and
Rosemary Braatz, a state Conservative Party committee member who
worked in Pataki's Senate office.
</P>
<P>
   At least once, Pataki was the beneficiary of an organized
fund-raising campaign involving doctors affiliated with the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Dr. Kenneth Schwartz, president of a large group of
radiologists who provided the hospital with X-ray services, held a
fund-raising dinner at his house in Bedford for Pataki, who was
running for his first term as governor. Pataki attended, and dozens
of doctors made donations, including the nine radiologists from the
Schwartz-led group, who gave Pataki $3,400, according to state
campaign records.
</P>
<P>
   One radiologist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
he was told that the renewal of the radiology group's contract with
the hospital ``may depend on'' generous donations, and another, a
Democrat, said he was ``gently coerced,'' but five other doctors
said there was no pressure at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally voluntary,'' said Dr. Marc A. Hertz, who gave
$250.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hudson Valley Hospital Center was founded on the downtown
riverbank 110 years ago as Peekskill Hospital and for generations
it served this plain-spoken city of 19,500. But by the 1980s, the
hospital, which had relocated outside Peekskill's borders, was
struggling to survive, with threats of insolvency and outdated
equipment that made it hard to attract doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Into this mess in 1986 strode Boyle, a canny businessman who
made his money in concrete, construction and real estate. By all
accounts, he was the visionary who drew up the strategies hat
rescued the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   After his selection as chairman, he determined that the hospital
needed not only to modernize, but but also to expand its patient
base by placing clinics as far north as Beacon and as far south as
Croton-on-Hudson. Doctors practicing in those outposts would refer
patients and boost hospital revenue.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure on the board, Hudson Valley Hospital, with 120
beds, has tripled its staff to 325 doctors and sharply increased
admissions and patient visits. Patients are drawn by a hospital
with a state-of-the-art emergency room (including its own
helicopter pad), a breast-care clinic and a special exercise room
for cardiac patients. In December, the Joint Commission on the
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, examining 500 standards
of care, awarded Hudson Valley a score of 99 percent, a rating
achieved by only 4 percent of the 5,000 accredited hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other person, Boyle, 62, is credited with this
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is his monument, that is his labor of love,'' said a
board member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``I cannot
believe that man would do anything to harm that institution.''
</P>
<P>
   But questions are being raised within and outside the hospital
about whether Boyle may have improperly benefited from his ties to
the hospital, even though he was generous with his time and donated
large gifts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Boyle learned that a watch-assembly plant in
Croton-on-Hudson, just a few blocks from his home, was for sale.
According to the Pirro indictment, Boyle steered Pirro to the
building and in April, a Pirro-controlled company, Distinctive
Properties of Croton, bought it for $900,000. Around the same time,
the hospital agreed to lease the building as office space for
affiliated doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-count indictment against Pirro, which contends he
deducted personal expenditures like a Ferrari as business expenses,
said Boyle had acquired a 45 percent interest in Distinctive
Properties and, ``in violation of his fiduciary duties,'' never
told the hospital that he partly owned the building it was buying.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle did have the hospital's concurrence to manage the $530,000
renovation of the Croton building through his firm Rogene
Industries. Pat Morrow, a hospital spokesman, said Boyle was paid
$3,000 a month for nine months for managing the subcontractors. In
the minutes of various Croton village committees that had to
approve the renovation Boyle is sometimes referred to as the
building's owner and sometimes as the contractor. The hospital is
never mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew he was the contractor ,'' said Lois, who was on
the board at the time. ``We thought he would do a better job
because he cared for the hospital. I did not have any idea he had
an ownership interest.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1993, Distinctive Properties sold the building to the
hospital for $1.5 million. That would indicate Pirro made a
$600,000 profit in two years. But Boyle benefited amply, according
to the indictment and a Pirro associate. He was paid $292,299 from
Pirro-owned companies, which he did not disclose to the board.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle has issued a statement asserting that he ``had no equity
interest'' in the building, and through his lawyer, Andrew
Levander, said the payments from Pirro were for an unrelated
property. But an associate of Pirro's, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the payments to Boyle were finder's fees for having
steered Pirro to the Croton building. Boyle has referred all
questions about the matter to Levander, who in recent days has not
returned repeated phone calls seeking additional comments.
</P>
<P>
   The same year that the Croton building was sold, the main
hospital campus in Cortlandt began adding a wing and redoing its
ground floor. It was one of the largest local projects in years and
drew intense interest from board members involved in construction.
Lois, who owned Elmar Contracting Co., said that if he had not been
allowed to bid on the excavation, he would have resigned from the
board. He acknowledged that being a director gave him an edge over
other bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you know a project from the inception, you're comfortable
with it and you're predisposed to bid it cheaper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lois said he made no profit from the deal. Lindenbaum said he
was the lowest bidder for the plumbing job. The Woolfes said that
the property they sold was adjacent to the hospital, and that they
donated property as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lois said the real reward for his time on the board could not be
measured in money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a stroke four years ago and a serious one,'' he said,
``and I was glad I had a first-class place to go to and to realize
that 15 years of work on my part and the board's part paid off.''

   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ At the moment of its greatest peril, the
International Olympic Committee is on the verge of finally seeing
its financial dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sydney Games close next year, the IOC will enjoy its
largest payday ever, an estimated $180 million tax-free from its
cut of broadcast rights and royalties from the 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Added to the IOC's share of worldwide marketing rights plus its
take from the 1998 Nagano Games, the non-profit organization will
make an estimated $330 million in the four-year period since the
1996 Atlanta Olympics -- a far cry from the $5.1 million the IOC
took in from in the 1972-1976 period.
</P>
<P>
   This would eclipse by $100 million the IOC's record income for
the period that ended with Atlanta, which alone generated nearly
$120 million for the IOC despite a harrowing financial ride that
nearly left 1996 Olympics organizers with a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The financial information, most of which has not been made
public before, was provided to the Cox News Service by Olympics
officials during interviews at IOC headquarters here in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   The embattled IOC long has been reluctant to discuss its own
finances but is under increasing pressure to become more open
because of the embarrassing Salt Lake City bid scandal.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch, who
inherited a nearly bankrupt organization when he assumed power in
1980, has placed Olympic finances among his most urgent priorities,
always searching for new ways to generate huge sums of money by
trading on the Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money is needed to stage the Games, which now cost
cities upwards of $2 billion for the two-week event. But Samaranch
also has been intent on using the money to enhance the prestige and
power of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Olympics officials now acknowledge privately that at least some
of the underlying cause of the Salt Lake crisis can be attributed
to Samaranch's focus on finances. Indeed, until the current crisis
erupted in December, the committee under his leadership failed to
recognize the potential consequences of introducing so much money
so quickly into an environment that was so unprepared to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch had done virtually nothing in response to the prospect
that the IOC's 100 or so volunteer members -- many from poor,
developing nations -- might be tempted by the fresh river of money,
or that the practice of bidding cities spending so much money to
secure the Games could lead to corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Dick Pound, the Canadian IOC member leading the
inquiry into the scandal and the architect of the committee's
financial revolution, acknowledged that the committee had been slow
to react to the new reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economics of the Games changed so much from how much pain
was a city willing to endure to host them to an economic benefit of
$2 billion,'' he said. ``We just hadn't caught up to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers provided by the IOC trace the organization's 20-year
evolution from a staff of 19 operating modestly out of the elegant
old Chateau de Vidy on the banks of Lake Geneva to a thriving
business with 100 workers in a modern office complex, complete with
polished white marble walls and floors and a donated fleet of
Mercedes-Benz company cars. Samaranch and the members aren't paid,
but many of their expenses are covered either by the IOC or the
dozen or so cities that at any given time are vying for summer and
winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, times have been so good that the committee has managed
to build a $68.8 million Olympic museum on a majestic hillside park
overlooking the lake and the French Alps across the way. The IOC
spends about $8.1 million a year -- more than any one of its annual
budgets in the 1980s -- to cover the museum's operating deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was Samaranch's personal dream made possible by the
generosity of big contributors such as the Coca Cola Co., IBM Corp.
and Eastman-Kodak Co. It remains the biggest single recipient of
the IOC's largesse.
</P>
<P>
   As the IOC gathers this week(CQ) in Lausanne to confront the
Salt Lake City crisis, the members are expected to get the news
about the committee's sunny financial outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, their collective attention almost certainly will be
diverted by a wrenching debate over expelling as many as seven of
their colleagues accused of accepting bribes from the Salt Lake
committee that led the successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   They also will face demands for a wholesale restructuring of the
host city selection process to reduce the opportunities for
corruption, and calls for revolutionary change to the
</P>
<P>
   IOC itself.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, what would have been triumphant news of
Samaranch's victory in his long financial struggle will be lost in
the sound and fury of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures may raise new and thorny questions about the
IOC's management of such vast sums and its status as a non-profit
organization that makes so much money from the commercial
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of the committee's wealth also may increase the
pressure to disclose even more, a level of openness that would be
new to an organization uncomfortable with sharing its secrets.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   IOC executives say the committee's reluctance to open its books
has been grounded in a fear that the organization's success would
be used against it by the other groups that compete for shares of
the Olympic wealth -- the always-hungry sports federations and
national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Helmick, a former IOC member from the United States and
former member of the committee's executive board, said financial
details have never even been shared freely among the committee's
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never saw much of anything,'' Helmick said, who attributed
the committee's penchant for secrecy in part to Samaranch's Old
World style of keeping important information close to the vest.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   That may no longer be possible. Last week, a key sponsor
suggested that his company's decision to continue its support would
be contingent on the IOC's becoming open and accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Mattius Kleinart(CQ), a senior vice president at
DaimlerChrysler, said he has made his company's desire for openness
clear to the IOC. ``We have said to the IOC that our continued
support is conditional on you making a clear plan for creating
complete transparency in your finances so everyone can see the
money that goes in and the money that goes out,'' Kleinart told the
Sydney Morning Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Also prompted by the Salt Lake scandal, U.S. politicians are
considering whether to strip the IOC of its special tax status that
allows a U.S. sponsor to write off the entire cost of their
sponsorship. The resulting blow to the Olympics would be
tremendous, given that nine of the 11 top IOC corporate sponsors
are based in the United States. Each pays about $10 million a year
-- all of which is now tax deductible.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has come a long way from the days leading up to the 1984
Los Angeles Games when the committee was nearly broke, a common
condition back when the Games were essentially an amateur event
whose leaders considered the idea of making money vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   Avery Brundage(CQ), the American and longtime IOC president who
retired in 1975, believed with nearly religious fervor in the
gospel and purity of amateurism and danger of money.
</P>
<P>
   In words that seem almost prophetic today, he once said, ``The
minute we handle money, even if we only distribute it, there will
be trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   When Samaranch took office, he made building the IOC's financial
profile a consuming priority. In those days, the Games were in such
a disastrous state that the only serious bidder for the 1984 Games
was Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Because the IOC was financially weak and unsophisticated, Peter
Ueberroth, head of the L.A. organizing committee, dictated the
terms of the business deals to the IOC. He then reinvented the
Olympics as a marketing extravaganza, creating a surplus of more
than $225 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the Games, Samaranch went to Ueberroth hat in
hand asking for a share of the surplus to assist his struggling
IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Ueberroth said no. That memory has remained with Samaranch, who
said nearly a decade later, ``From Los Angeles we learned a little
lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic historian John Lucas, who has been studying the Olympics
since the 1950s, worries that money-making has become an unhealthy
preoccupation of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Chateau de Vidy in all these meetings, the Olympic
committee is spending an inordinately large amount of time on
economics and finances,'' said Lucas, a lecturer and author of a
book on the Games. ``They need to remember their purpose -- the
support of world sport and the honor of the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years after his rise to power, Samaranch's quest for
financial stability is nearing success. The IOC now is awash with
liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with its income from the 1994 Winter Games in
Lillehammer and worldwide marketing rights for the four-year
period, the IOC closed the Atlanta Olympics with revenues of more
than $230 million and cash-on-hand of more than $121 million. The
committee pays no taxes under a special status awarded by the Swiss
government in 1981 and renewed last autumn before the Salt Lake
crisis erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The figures do not reflect the IOC-controlled Olympic Solidarity
program, which provides money to national Olympic committees,
particularly those in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Funded entirely from a percentage of broadcast rights fees, the
program is dispersing $120 million between 1996 and 2000. Officials
estimate that Olympic Solidarity will have an estimated $200
million at its disposal after the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   IOC leaders privately have a goal of placing $100 million in
savings to provide a measure of independence and to assure that the
IOC would survive a catastrophe such as the cancellation of an
Olympics. So far, the IOC has about $65 million stashed in its
Olympic Foundation -- which is governed by the committee's
executive board -- with every prospect of meeting its goal at the
end of the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   These figures reflect only the money collected by the IOC and do
not account for the huge amounts consumed by organizing committees
that must prepare their cities to host the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Olympic organizers spent more than $1.7 billion over six
years to stage the 1996 Games, while Sydney organizers are working
with a budget of more than $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A large share of worldwide Olympic revenues also goes to
international sports federations and national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike organizing committees and other groups, the IOC
builds no sports facilities, organizes no competitions and trains
no athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the IOC spends more than $2 million a month on payroll,
travel, staging meetings, public relations, lawyers, consultants
and other day-to-day costs. Payroll is the largest expense,
consuming about 40 percent of the operating budget, with the cost
of staging IOC sessions, executive board meetings and commission
meetings taking about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A number of groups receive grants from the IOC, including the
Olympic Study and Research Center, International Council of
Arbitration and Sports and the World Olympians Association.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also pays for the costs of sending a small
evaluation commission to bidding cities and for running its offices
in a host city during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, one of the reforms that has occasionally been
discussed would be to require the IOC to pay for its members to
visit bidding cities, thus ending the unseemly practice of making
cities provide first-class tickets and hotel rooms for the members.
The idea has never been taken seriously before.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the IOC has been willing to spend huge sums on hosting its
own events. In 1994, the committee spent more than $16 million on a
week-long gathering in Paris to mark the centennial of the founding
of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the IOC's proclivity for high living and big spending,
Lucas, the Olympic historian, believes the committee should
continue aggressively building its fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see the IOC continue its aggressive
accumulation of money -- big time money and investing it wisely,''
Lucas said. ``I'd like them to continue so that by the Olympic
Games of 2012, the IOC will have accumulated enough money to permit
the IOC to get out of the business of business forever.''

minute we handle money, even if we only distribute it, there will
be trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   When Samaranch took office, he made building the IOC's financial
profile a consuming priority. In those days, the Games were in such
a disastrous state that the only serious bidder for the 1984 Games
was Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Because the IOC was financially weak and unsophisticated, Peter
Ueberroth, head of the L.A. organizing committee, dictated the
terms of the business deals to the IOC. He then reinvented the
Olympics as a marketing extravaganza, creating a surplus of more
than $225 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the Games, Samaranch went to Ueberroth hat in
hand asking for a share of the surplus to assist his struggling
IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Ueberroth said no. That memory has remained with Samaranch, who
said nearly a decade later, ``From Los Angeles we learned a little
lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic historian John Lucas, who has been studying the Olympics
since the 1950s, worries that money-making has become an unhealthy
preoccupation of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Chateau de Vidy in all these meetings, the Olympic
committee is spending an inordinately large amount of time on
economics and finances,'' said Lucas, a lecturer and author of a
book on the Games. ``They need to remember their purpose -- the
support of world sport and the honor of the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years after his rise to power, Samaranch's quest for
financial stability is nearing success. The IOC now is awash with
liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with its income from the 1994 Winter Games in
Lillehammer and worldwide marketing rights for the four-year
period, the IOC closed the Atlanta Olympics with revenues of more
than $230 million and cash-on-hand of more than $121 million. The
committee pays no taxes under a special status awarded by the Swiss
government in 1981 and renewed last autumn before the Salt Lake
crisis erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The figures do not reflect the IOC-controlled Olympic Solidarity
program, which provides money to national Olympic committees,
particularly those in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Funded entirely from a percentage of broadcast rights fees, the
program is dispersing $120 million between 1996 and 2000. Officials
estimate that Olympic Solidarity will have an estimated $200
million at its disposal after the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   IOC leaders privately have a goal of placing $100 million in
savings to provide a measure of independence and to assure that the
IOC would survive a catastrophe such as the cancellation of an
Olympics. So far, the IOC has about $65 million stashed in its
Olympic Foundation -- which is governed by the committee's
executive board -- with every prospect of meeting its goal at the
end of the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   These figures reflect only the money collected by the IOC and do
not account for the huge amounts consumed by organizing committees
that must prepare their cities to host the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Olympic organizers spent more than $1.7 billion over six
years to stage the 1996 Games, while Sydney organizers are working
with a budget of more than $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A large share of worldwide Olympic revenues also goes to
international sports federations and national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike organizing committees and other groups, the IOC
builds no sports facilities, organizes no competitions and trains
no athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the IOC spends more than $2 million a month on payroll,
travel, staging meetings, public relations, lawyers, consultants
and other day-to-day costs. Payroll is the largest expense,
consuming about 40 percent of the operating budget, with the cost
of staging IOC sessions, executive board meetings and commission
meetings taking about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A number of groups receive grants from the IOC, including the
Olympic Study and Research Center, International Council of
Arbitration and Sports and the World Olympians Association.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also pays for the costs of sending a small
evaluation commission to bidding cities and for running its offices
in a host city during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, one of the reforms that has occasionally been
discussed would be to require the IOC to pay for its members to
visit bidding cities, thus ending the unseemly practice of making
cities provide first-class tickets and hotel rooms for the members.
The idea has never been taken seriously before.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the IOC has been willing to spend huge sums on hosting its
own events. In 1994, the committee spent more than $16 million on a
week-long gathering in Paris to mark the centennial of the founding
of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the IOC's proclivity for high living and big spending,
Lucas, the Olympic historian, believes the committee should
continue aggressively building its fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see the IOC continue its aggressive
accumulation of money -- big time money and investing it wisely,''
Lucas said. ``I'd like them to continue so that by the Olympic
Games of 2012, the IOC will have accumulated enough money to permit
the IOC to get out of the business of business forever.''

SIR ARNOLD MACHIN, SCULPTOR WHOSE IMAGE OF QUEEN APPEARS ON BRITISH
STAMP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Arnold Machin, a master British sculptor who upstaged his
distinguished career with a single bas-relief bust that became one
of the world's most reproduced images, died on Monday at his home
in Staffordshire, England. He was 87 and had designed the portrait
of Queen Elizabeth II that has appeared on every British postage
stamp since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He also designed the effigy of the queen that appeared on
British coins from 1967 to 1985, but it was his separate design for
the royal stamp that made Machin (whose surname is pronounced
MAY-chins) a household name among philatelists.
</P>
<P>
   Since they were first issued in March 1967, depicting a youthful
but regal-looking queen wearing a tiara and pearls, more than 60
billion of the distinctive stamps have been issued in scores of
denominations, a variety of printing processes and some 80 colors,
making the issue a favorite of discriminating collectors.
</P>
<P>
   While it is the queen who is honored by the stamps, it is a
tribute to the appeal of Machin's design that the stamps are known
not as Elizabeths but as Machins.
</P>
<P>
   Born into a family of Staffordshire potters and trained at a
series of art schools including the Royal College of Art, Machin
first achieved signal success in the 1940s when three of his
terracottas _ ``John the Baptist,'' ``The Annunciation'' and
``Spring'' _ were acquired by the Tate Gallery in London.
</P>
<P>
   Within 20 years he had become a member of the Royal Academy,
taught at the Royal College of Art and settled in as Master of
Sculpture at the Royal Academy schools, where he became mentor to
many young sculptors.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1964, after having failed in previous coin
competitions, a design by Machin was chosen by the Royal Mint for
the first British decimal coins.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the new coins appeared in Britain in 1968, Machin's
separate design for British stamps had been in use for a year.
</P>
<P>
   His stamp and coin designs were both the second of Queen
Elizabeth's reign, which began in 1952. Curiously, while the coins
have since been redesigned twice by other artists, each depicting a
progressively older monarch, the Machin stamps have endured since
they were first issued in 1967, when the queen was 41. They
replaced stamps first issued on Dec. 5, 1952, based on a portrait
of the queen by Dorothy Wilding, a society photographer who made
the first of her Elizabeth portraits when the queen was still a
young princess.
</P>
<P>
   The longevity of the Machins, the sculptor once speculated, was
due to the fact that the profile portrait was derived not from a
photograph of the queen but from a photograph of a delicately lit
sculpture, whose subtle highlights and shadows produce a timeless
cameo effect.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving that subtlety was not easy. As Machin recalled, when
studio lighting failed to produce the desired effect, the sculpture
was taken outside on a foggy day and photographed in a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when sculptors were experimenting with streamlined
modern forms, Machin reverted to a classical approach for the Royal
Mail commission, even using as his inspiration the first postage
stamp ever issued, the 1840 Penny Black depicting Queen Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   As the only country not required by the Universal Postal Union
to include its name (or initials) on its stamps (the portrait of
the current sovereign being considered sufficient international
identification), Britain had long been known for the elegant
simplicity of its stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The Machins took simplicity a step further, eliminating all
extraneous decorations and symbols, including the words ``postage''
and ``revenue,'' leaving only the portrait and the postal value.
</P>
<P>
   After his great postal and mint triumphs of the 1960s, Machin
continued to produce portraits of the royal family, including the
designs for the commemorative coins issued for the royal silver
wedding anniversary in 1972 and the 25th anniversary of the queen's
coronation in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   He also accepted private commissions, among other things
producing a set of ceramic chessmen and bas-relief portraits of the
royal family for Wedgwood.
</P>
<P>
   As a hobby, Machin took up more ambitious sculpting, working not
in terracotta but in landscapes, creating at his home near
Eccleshall a large garden of paths, grottoes, waterfalls and
fountains.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Patricia Newton, a well-known flower
painter, and a son, Francis, an architect.  &QL;

AFTER A FIRE, SUBWAY RIDERS TAKE A DETOUR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Subway riders in the Carroll Gardens section of
Brooklyn Saturday found a patchwork of shuttle trains and buses to
help them bypass the Bergen Street station of the F and G lines,
whose control panel was ravaged by fire Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Riders on the G train, a little-used local line that makes 26
stops, faced the most disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   A back-and-forth shuttle train replaced the normal trains to the
five stops from Bedford-Nostrand to Hoyt-Schermerhorn in the Fort
Greene neighborhood. The train stopped at Hoyt-Schermerhorn rather
than making its last three stops, but riders could catch a bus
upstairs that ran in a triangle from Hoyt Street to Jay Street _
where they could catch trains into Manhattan or deeper into
Brooklyn _ then down to the closed Bergen Street station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to mean a lot of extra commuting time, and I'm not
happy about it,'' said Stella Ajulu, 36, an environmental
technician from Rego Park, Queens, who was riding the shuttle bus
as the last leg in a morning journey that was also disrupted by
construction elsewhere. ``All I can say is, there has to be a
better plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Repairs to the Bergen Street station are expected to take up to
two months. Melissa Farley, a spokeswoman for New York City
Transit, said the replacement shuttle buses and trains would
continue indefinitely. The cause of the fire remains under
investigation, and the cost of repairs unknown, Ms. Farley said.
</P>
<P>
   Service on the F line resumed at midnight Friday, with trains
bypassing the Bergen Street station. People who normally get on or
off at Bergen could walk a half-dozen blocks to the Carroll Street
station to pick up the train, or catch a special bus up to Jay
Street to meet it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just going to take them a little bit longer,'' Ms. Farley
said. ``We have as much service as we can put out there to get
people where they want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 4 million daily subway riders, Ms. Farley estimated that
the disruptions would affect only about 2,000. The G line carries
only about 10,000 people on weekends and 30,000 on weekdays,
compared to about 500,000 people who ride the system's busiest
lines, including the F and the 4, 5, and 6 trains, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those interviewed seemed unfazed by the delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to set me back about 15 minutes, but it just
means getting here earlier,'' said Robin Pishton, 26, a student at
the Fashion Institute of Technology waiting at Bergen Street for
one of the five buses making the triangle route.

MURIEL BENTLEY, BALLET DANCER, DIES AT AGE 82  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Muriel Bentley, an early member of Ballet Theater (now American
Ballet Theater) who was praised for her comic gifts and witty
dancing, died on Monday at the Kaiser Permanente Hospital in
Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 82 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bentley was probably best known for her long association
with Jerome Robbins. She originated the role of the sassy,
purse-toting woman in Robbins' ``Fancy Free.'' Speaking of the
character in an interview in The New York Times last year, Ms.
Bentley probably inadvertently described her own great charm best.
``My role was modeled after me,'' she said. ``The way I walked, the
way I talked. It was like patent leather, shiny and bright and
crisp.''
</P>
<P>
   She also performed lead roles in major ballets by Agnes de Mille
and Antony Tudor at Ballet Theater, where she danced as a company
member from 1940 to 1946 and as a guest artist from 1954 to 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bentley created the role of the villainous Stepmother in
``Fall River Legend,'' de Mille's 1948 ballet about Lizzie Borden.
Describing the character as ``an incarnation of evil,'' John
Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, commented that Ms.
Bentley had played the role so superbly that ``if the girl had not
committed the murder herself almost anybody in the audience would
gladly have done it for her.'' She also appeared as a risque young
lady in de Mille's 1943 ballet ``Tally-Ho.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, Ms. Bentley studied with teachers like
Vecheslav Swoboda, Leon Fokine, Anton Dolin and Ruth St. Denis, and
also trained at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School. While still a
teen-ager, she danced with St. Denis in 1931 in ``The Prophetess.''
In 1936-37, she performed Spanish dance with Jose Greco, moving on
to the Metropolitan Opera Ballet before joining Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   At Ballet Theater, Ms. Bentley also danced major roles in
Leonide Massine's ``Capriccio Espagnol,'' in de Mille's ``Three
Virgins and a Devil,'' and in Tudor's ``Judgment of Paris,''
``Undertow'' and ``Gala Performance.'' Ms. Bentley joined Robbins'
Ballets: USA in 1958, performing in ballets that included ``NY
Export: Op. Jazz,'' ``The Concert'' and ``Moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bentley also performed in Broadway musicals, among them
``Call Me Madam'' and ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bentley retired from the stage in the early 1960s and worked
for a time in New York as an interior designer and a theatrical
agent before moving to Los Angeles in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   She continued to work into the late 1980s in performing arts
management.
</P>
<P>
   She has no immediate survivors.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the shoot-around in the Garden on Friday
afternoon, the talk was not about contracts or labor unrest or
sneaker endorsements, but about the return of the Garden's greatest
player: Stephon Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``God gave him something no one else got,'' said Derek Wooten,
as he tied his defender in a knot with a crossover dribble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to tear it up, show the world what Coney Island's
all about,'' said Jay Wright, pulling down a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The names Wooten and Wright don't appear on the game roster of
the Knicks or the St. John's Red Storm, or any other team for that
matter. This court was not at Madison Square Garden, but the other
Garden, the one on a windswept patch of blacktop between Surf and
Mermaid avenues in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, where the
name Marbury is synonymous with basketball glory.
</P>
<P>
   When Marbury, the star point guard with the Minnesota
Timberwolves, was traded to the New Jersey Nets on Thursday, the
news reverberated across the basketball world, but it had special
meaning in the Coney Island projects, where Marbury grew up and
honed the skills that will earn him nearly $71 million over the
next six years.
</P>
<P>
   At the other Garden, where Marbury now lights up the scoreboard
and makes no-look assists when his team passes through, he has
friends who drive imported cars and wear fur coats.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Garden of Marbury's youth, the old friends barely
have enough money to catch the subway out to Herald Square. ``I
ain't got jack,'' said Horace Bowe, 24, fidgeting with two rumpled
dollar bills. ``But I love the man, don't resent him a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, 22, is coming back a winner, a man who got out and made
it back to his own turf on his own terms. These half-dozen men are
happy for their friend, who still returns to the neighborhood, in a
black limousine, just to get a haircut.
</P>
<P>
   But Marbury's homecoming, they said, is also a bittersweet
reminder of their own struggles to get out, of being stuck, of what
could have been, of dreams left on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know why they call this place the Garden don't you?'' Bowe
asked no one in particular. ``Because none of us here ever thought
we was going to make it to the prime-time Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Every man has a dream, Bowe said. It's just that in his
neighborhood, some people lose sight of the prize. As teen-agers
they dream of big-dollar sports contracts. School, of course, is
never a thought.
</P>
<P>
   For Bowe, the dream is becoming the heavyweight champion of the
world. His uncle, Riddick Bowe, is a former champion, and the
younger Bowe hopes that his uncle's skills, and success, are
embedded somewhere in the family's genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   But with a swollen lip and gnarled fists, and an 11-2
professional record, the closest he may ever get to a championship
bout in Madison Square Garden is on pay-per-view, where he planned
to watch Saturday night's fight between Evander Holyfield and
Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot to get out of this neighborhood,'' said Wooten,
24, a short, stocky man who shot ball as his two young sons looked
on.
</P>
<P>
   Wooten played basketball at Abraham Lincoln High School and was
cut the same year that Marbury joined the team, which won the
Public Schools Athletic League and New York State titles in 1995.
That same year, Wooten dropped out of school.
</P>
<P>
   But with his old friend returning to town, those old dreams
resurfaced in the cold afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me? I'm looking to get my GED and then play ball at a junior
college,'' he said. And then he looked at his children. ``But I
don't live in the million-dollar world. I got real responsibilities
to think about now. I got their dreams to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, Don Marbury, Stephon's brother, walked onto the court.
One of five basketball prodigies in the family, Don Marbury got the
closest to the NBA before Stephon made it.
</P>
<P>
   He played shooting guard for Texas A&AMP;M and was the Southwest
Conference's leading scorer in 1986. Another Marbury, Eric, teamed
with future NBA star Dominique Wilkins at Georgia in the early
1980s. And Norman Marbury played at St. Francis College in Brooklyn
earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Few men make it the next step. With only 300 slots in the NBA,
the odds of making it are long. But to some, it remains the
yardstick by which lives are measured.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Don Marbury, 34, teaches at Public School 288 and is highly
respected in the neighborhood, yet when people talk about him, it
is as if he was an also-ran, as if he was somehow a broken man
because he never got to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But he teaches a different message to his students. ``I tell the
kids you're a hero if you can have the discipline to train your
mind,'' Marbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, New York has had its share of home-grown
basketball heroes, none more famous than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who
grew up in the Inwood Park section of Manhattan, and Julius Erving,
who attended Roosevelt High School on Long Island. As far as point
guards are concerned, Stephon Marbury is the latest in a long line
of greats dating to the late 1940s, players like Bob Cousy, Dick
McGuire, Lenny Wilkens, Nate Archibald, Kenny Smith and Kenny
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   And New York has seen its share of playground legends swallowed
by the streets. Joe ``The Destroyer'' Hammond never played a minute
of high school basketball but was still talented enough to be
drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in 1971. He once scored 50 points
on Erving in the Rucker Tournament, in which playground stars play
with and against college and professional stars. But he never made
it to the NBA, instead spending years in prison for conspiring to
sell drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The late Earl `The Goat' Manigault could pick quarters off the
tops of backboards, but he allowed a heroin addiction to kill any
chance he had at turning pro.
</P>
<P>
   And Richie Adams, a star for the University of Nevada-Las Vegas
in the 1980s, was drafted by the Washington Bullets but became a
drug addict and is now serving a prison term for murdering a young
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hartstein, who coached all the Marbury boys at Lincoln,
including the youngest, Zack, who will play next season at the
University of Rhode Island, said those who admire Stephon's success
must learn that there are other ways to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for all the guys to be happy for him, but they have
to remember that they need to pursue their own goals and not live
vicariously through him,'' Hartstein said.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as there are hoops, he said, there will be hoop
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Telfair, 13, a cousin of the Marburys, lives in the
same building where Stephon grew up, overlooking the Garden.
Already, the boy is a basketball celebrity. A national magazine has
him ranked as the best seventh-grade prospect in the country. A
reporter from Dallas came to interview him earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   His dream? ``I want to take my family out of the projects _ like
Stephon did,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andre Gilbert Ernotte, a playwright, filmmaker and
director of stage, television and opera productions in New York and
Europe, died on March 8 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He
was 55 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He had liver disease and died of heart failure while awaiting a
liver transplant, said Elliot Tiber, his companion and the author
with Ernotte of the 1982 play ``The Music Keeper,'' which recently
opened in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Ernotte, a native of Liege, Belgium, tackled offbeat and surreal
subjects Off Broadway as well as more traditional fare. He began to
make his mark in New York in the 1970s, and since then he had
divided his time between the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He directed performances at the Brooklyn Academy of Music,
Manhattan Theater Club, Playwrights Horizons, South Street Theater,
Ubu Repertory Theater, Improv Theater, the Joseph Papp Public
Theater, New York Shakespeare Festival, Stratford Shakespeare
Theater, Kennedy Center, Goodspeed Opera House and the Royal Opera
House in London.
</P>
<P>
   He was engaged in a production at the McCarter Theater in
Princeton, N.J., when he became ill.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s he became a mainstay of the Vineyard Theater and
Workshop Center in lower Manhattan. There he directed 13
productions, notably Polly Pen's ``Christina Alberta's Father,''
which earned him an Obie Award in 1994; Ms. Pen's ``Bed and Sofa''
and ``Goblin Market,'' and Lanie Robertson's ``Lady Day at
Emerson's Bar &AMP; Grill,'' a 1986 reflection on Billie Holiday's life
and art.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Tiber, he is survived by two sisters, both of Belgium.

WOLF ULRICH VON HASSELL, FORMER WEST GERMAN AMBASSADOR, DIES AT
85

   Wolf Ulrich von Hassell, a former West German ambassador to the
United Nations who helped the German resistance to Hitler during
World War II and oversaw his country's post-war transition to full
membership in international organizations, died at his home in
Southampton, N.Y., on March 3.
</P>
<P>
   He was 85 years old. His family said von Hassell died of
complications from emphysema.
</P>
<P>
   Through his family ties and his diplomatic postings, von Hassell
witnessed many of the events that shaped his country in the years
during and after the war.
</P>
<P>
   He was a confidant of his father, Ulrich von Hassell, the last
Weimar Republic ambassador to Italy who was executed by the Nazis
in 1944 for his involvement in a plot to overthrow Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, von Hassell, who had helped his father maintain
contacts with the Allies, edited and published his father's
diaries.
</P>
<P>
   During von Hassell's tenure as ambassador and deputy head of
mission to the United Nations, from 1971 to 1978, the Federal
Republic of Germany regained its status as a full member rather
than observer. His previous diplomatic postings were in the Foreign
Office in Bonn, in Belgium and in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Christa von Studnitz; a
son, Agostino, who lives in Manhattan and in Virginia; a son,
Adrian, of Manhattan; a daughter, Malve, of Southampton; and two
grandchildren, Christian Ulrich and William Thassilo, who live in
Virginia. &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ With all the strength of her 90 years, Chizuko Miyata
clutched her crisp, cream-colored coupons and began dreaming of
what she would buy with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so interested in fashion these days,'' said Mrs.
Miyata, a twinkle in her eye. ``So I'm going to use them to buy the
things I need in everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim of these coupons is to boost buying,'' added Mrs.
Miyata, who had just picked up the new coupons that the government
is handing out to spur consumption and revive the economy. ``I
understand that aim. So I'm going to spend more.''
</P>
<P>
   If all Japanese citizens were that loyal, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi would have nothing to worry about. But nobody knows whether
the scheme _ one of the oddest ideas ever tried to revive a major
economy _ will succeed in getting people to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy is stuck in its worst recession since the end of
World War II, even if there are some signs of progress, and one of
the problems has been that ordinary citizens are so anxious about
the future that they are saving their yen rather than spending it.
The government has tried tax cuts, but people tend to save them as
well.
</P>
<P>
   So Obuchi and his Cabinet are handing out something that people
cannot save. It is distributing nearly $6 billion worth of shopping
coupons, and since they expire in August people have no choice but
to use them in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very big experiment,'' said Katsuyuki Hikasa, a
senior policymaking official in the Komei Party, which originally
proposed the idea to the governing Liberal Democratic Party. ``This
is the first such economic experiment done anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, economists have attacked the plan on many fronts, and few
believe it will be very successful. For starters, some say that
since money is fungible, consumers will spend the coupons and save
an equivalent amount of cash.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plan has been a logistical nightmare, and it is
proving expensive to administer. The government has also attached
strings to the coupons so that residents normally must use their
coupons in their own neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   To boost local business, the government had each town and
municipality find its own printers, dye specialists and paper
makers to mint their form of local currency. So some coupons are
pink, some are blue, some are white, some are cream.
</P>
<P>
   The localities can also set their own rules, within guidelines.
So some coupons can be spent at brothels and nightclubs or gambling
at pachinko parlors and mahjong tables. Others can be used only for
purposes that the authorities deem appropriate, such as shops and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, authorities have tried to help small businesses
by forcing residents to wait 40 days before they can use their
coupons at big department stores, while others have color-coded
coupons that restrict them to spending half at the big stores to
ensure that at least the other half is spent at small stores.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is whether the coupons will encourage people to
spend more. And the risk is that there are plenty of people out
there like Emiko Kawamura.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kawamura, 41, sees the coupons as a form of financial
relief that allows her to expand her rainy day nest egg. With three
kids, including a 16-year-old who does not qualify for the coupon,
Mrs. Kawamura is pinching pennies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to buy anything expensive or big,'' said Mrs.
Kawamura. ``With the coupons to spend, I have extra money. So I
don't have to take so much out from my bank account this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Keiko Komine, a lively homemaker with two boys, is more like the
kind of person the government is hoping for. Mrs. Komine plans to
plunk her $340 worth in coupons into a new bookshelf for her
6-year-old son who is about to start first grade. Her children
recently learned how to ski and so she also has plans to squeeze in
a short vacation on the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking of saving because we have to buy a lot of
things this season,'' said Mrs. Komine. ``I'm hoping to spend the
extra money on skiing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The biggest complaint comes from the large swath of Japanese
people who do not get the coupons. In general, the coupons go to
families with children under 15 or senior citizens over 65, and the
amount handed out varies with the number of people in each
category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there should be other ways of doing this,'' said Chie
Takeguchi, a 36-year-old mother who tagged her baby girl along as
she picked up her $165 worth of $8 coupons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who get the coupons and others who do
not get them. Originally, the idea was that everyone would get
something. But they changed that, and I have some reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Takeguchi's parents are younger than the 65-year-old age
limit to receive the coupons, and she said: ``They have expressed
the idea that they do not think the program is entirely fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Fumiko Okazawa, who is 72, expressed puzzlement that she can
receive the coupons but that her husband, who is 80, cannot. For
elderly recipients, the government screens out people who earn too
much money, and he was excluded for that reason. Her husband, she
said, was a bit envious and a bit contemptuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just tells me that I can receive these coupons because my
income is so low,'' she explained.

   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia _ It would seem like the simplest of
questions, one that could be settled with a few good maps and maybe
a cheap global positioning device: Where on Earth, quite literally,
is the town of Badme?
</P>
<P>
   Badme is a place of no particular consequence in the highlands
between Ethiopia and its much smaller kin, Eritrea, two nations of
great promise on the Horn of Africa. But lying on the battlefields
near this town are the corpses of perhaps 10,000 soldiers _ maybe
less, maybe more _ who died over the last month because each nation
claims Badme and the surrounding area as its own. (For comparison's
sake, 3,200 people have died in Northern Ireland's sectarian
conflict in the last 30 years, according to the U.S. State
Department).
</P>
<P>
   None of the Badme region has much value or historical or
emotional resonance. It is merely undefined. And its outlines
became so ambiguous in a way that tells the story of many conflicts
in modern-day Africa: The colonists of a century ago, in this case
Italy and Britain, buried a time bomb or two in the treaties that
marked off their ambitions. African rulers of today have been
unable, or unwilling, to defuse them.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the treaties are wildly complicated and laughably
imprecise, using tribes and river junctions and obscure mountains
as reference points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling,'' Professor Bahru Zewde said in his office
at Addis Ababa University early this month. He is one of Ethiopia's
leading historians, and he knows as much as anyone about the
history of the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which were a
single nation until Eritrea split off six years ago with Ethiopia's
blessing. He has come to the conclusion, deliberatively and
sincerely, that Badme belongs to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Eritrea says it has looked long and hard at
the same evidence. Asked to make the Eritrean case for this
article, a government spokesman pointed a reporter in the direction
of a Harvard-trained lawyer and U.S. citizen born in Eritrea,
Seyoum Haregot. He is a technical adviser to the United Nations in
Asmara, the Eritrean capital, and he emphasized that he is only a
civil servant who researched the issue not for the government but
out of curiosity. ``I am not ideological about it at all,'' he
said. ``But I believe the Eritreans are right.''
</P>
<P>
   What is fascinating is that both Bahru and Haregot differed
barely at all in the evidence they presented. Each side seems to be
looking at the same facts and drawing completely contrary
conclusions. That has made the dispute especially hard to solve.
</P>
<P>
   What follows, then, is a summary of the major treaties that
marked off the boundary between Ethiopia and Eritrea and how those
documents have been interpreted to justify the latest of Africa's
bloody wars.
</P>
<P>
   Of a dozen or so treaties signed near the turn of the century,
three are important. The key signatories were Italy, which
colonized Eritrea, and Ethiopia, which fought off the Italians'
southward march and remained independent.
</P>
<P>
   A 1908 treaty between the Ethiopians and Italians established
the long eastern border as a line running parallel to the Red Sea.
A 1900 treaty, also between Italy and Ethiopia, established the
eastern part of the Ethiopia-Eritrea boundary along the Mereb River
and two tributaries. To the west, a straight line was drawn between
the town of Tomat, in present-day Sudan, northward to Todluc. And a
treaty signed in 1902 _ the essence of the problem _ moved that
straight line to the east. But the reference points were not the
most precise. Those points became the junction, on the south,
between the Setit and Maieteb Rivers and, on the north, between the
Mereb and Mai Ambessa Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   On some later maps, the 1902 line is moved even farther east,
but in either case Ethiopia claims that the line, which is about 50
miles long, falls to the west of Badme. That is to say, Badme is
Ethiopian.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the maps show this straight line, however capricious it
might be,'' Bahru said. ``There is no way the line could bend.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Eritreans say that even if the line does not bend, it
can indeed move. Haregot pointed to two other sections of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   One provides that the Kunama tribe, a group of highland cattle
drivers, be included in Eritrea. (``This is, as you say in America,
baloney,'' grumbled Professor Mesfin Wolde-Mariam, a retired
geographer and past head of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, who
is opposed to the war completely and furious with both sides.
``People are not stones.'')
</P>
<P>
   The other provision says that Mount Ala Tacura is also included
in Eritrea (The State Department claims it cannot even find this
mountain).
</P>
<P>
   The effect of those two additions, Haregot said, appears to move
the line further east, putting Badme in Eritrea. ``There is no
confusion about the delineation,'' he said. ``That can be
determined by cartographers. There should not be a fight between
the two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But a U.S. official said that even Haregot's interpretation does
not do justice to the issue's full complexity. As an example, he
described the terrain around Badme: ``It's desert right on the edge
of the Ethiopian plateau, and when the rains come they come
suddenly and they rush off the side of the mountains with
tremendous force. When you have water moving with such force, the
rivers move over 97 years. And so the lines move.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain that the treaties made the land theirs, Eritrean forces
marched into the Badme region in May 1998. Fighting lasted a month.
Then, after nine months of re-arming, fighting erupted again Feb.
6.
</P>
<P>
   By Feb. 26, Ethiopia had pushed the Eritreans out of Badme and
Eritrea agreed to a peace proposal drafted last year by the
Organization of African Unity. Ethiopia, saying it had accepted the
plan long ago and was not sure it trusted Eritrea, has not yet
agreed to a truce.
</P>
<P>
   If a cease-fire ever comes, the peace plan requires that experts
go over the ground and finally define the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not think of the borders,'' said Mesfin, of those who
planned Eritrea's independence in 1993. ``So, hurriedly, they were
independent. Now we have no idea what on earth is happening. And
mind you, these are the same people on both sides. They speak the
same language, have the same culture. It's very depressing.''

<P>
   UNDATED: You've heard of March Madness. Well, this is March
Mailness, when your Uncle Fearless dives into the mailbag to
retrieve tidbits of interesting reader feedback worth sharing.
Today's first offering concerns confusion over marketing tactics by
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that reputable banks and loan companies seem to be
directing their advertising at people with poor credit? Every day I
hear things like, `Even if you've had a glitch in your credit in
the past...we want to loan you money.' I'm sure there's some logic
to it all, but I just can't figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Confused:
</P>
<P>
   Depends on your definition of reputable. If my bank starts
running an aggressive ad campaign aimed at deadbeats or pitching
home equity loans amounting to 125 percent of the property's value,
my first move will be to start looking for a new bank.
</P>
<P>
   One reader took issue with a column endorsing Medicare reform
proposals designed to ease the program's financial squeeze:
</P>
<P>
   ``Re your callous remarks about Medicare. In a few years you may
not be so anxious to withhold care and be rid of the old geezers
when you have become one of them. Remember: What goes around comes
around. Here's hoping your future brings you all you deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Peeved:
</P>
<P>
   Callous? Moi? As someone within flirtation range of geezerhood
who has a mother almost 84, you misunderstood my point, which
wasn't to withhold care. However, as a parent and grandparent, the
coming health-care needs of me and my spouse are tempered by the
knowledge that whatever my generation does should be done with an
eye toward preserving the system for those who will be paying the
bills that make our benefits possible.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Internet commerce is also gaining momentum, to the
point that one alert reader thought he caught Uncle Fearless doing
a back-pedaling act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interesting piece on the challenges of collecting sales taxes
on Internet transactions. I recall you wrote a (recent) column that
dismissed the importance of Internet commerce, that it accounted
for only a paltry 1 percent of all retail transactions, and that
predictions of meteoric growth were due to hype. What gives? I
sense a contradiction in your writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Alert:
</P>
<P>
   It was inevitable the second column would come back to haunt me.
The first column was in the context of overall U.S. and world
commerce. The subsequent column was in the context of revenue
effects on state and local governments. There really wasn't a
contradiction. Even with catalog sales at $50 billion and Internet
transactions close to $10 billion, this still is a minuscule part
of overall U.S. consumption spending. Given the relatively small
size of many municipal budgets, though, the growing loss of sales
tax revenues to the fast-growing Internet market might create an
inordinate budget squeeze for some local governments throughout
America.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, a fellow muser contributed this thought with the
admonition not to dwell on it too much because it might bring on a
headache:
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in America do people buy double cheeseburgers with a
large fries and a diet soft drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Musing Guy: Amazin', ain't it?
</P>
<P>
   Keep them cards and letters comin', hear?

THREE NATIONS JOIN NATO IN CEREMONY AT HARRY S. TRUMAN LIBRARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ On an Independence stage Friday, three new
flags joined those banners belonging to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The colors of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic were placed
with those of 16 other NATO nations in the Truman Library
auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   The historic sight occurred just after the foreign ministers of
the three nations signed documents certifying their entry into the
alliance. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright then stood with all
three diplomats, enjoying a prolonged ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we recognize in fact what has always been true in
spirit,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we confirm through our actions that the lands of King
Stephen and Cardinal Mindszenty, Charles the Fourth and Vaclav
Havel, Copernicus and Pope John Paul II, reside fully and
irrevocably within the Atlantic community for freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Brief addresses by each foreign minister preceded Albright's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic described how he, more than 30
years ago as a visiting student leader advocating freedom in
Czechoslovakia, was in Kansas City, Mo., on the August 1968 day
when the Soviet Union invaded his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is for me very symbolic,'' he said, ``that it is precisely
here that we today accept the guarantee that my country will never
again become a powerless victim of a foreign invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Janos Martonyi of Hungary, meanwhile, stressed that his country
was eager to shoulder the commitments that NATO membership
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bernard Shaw said that `Liberty means responsibility.
That is why most people dread it,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not. Hungarians know that membership in NATO is a
combination of advantages to enjoy and obligations to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hungary's wish to join NATO did not reflect only a desire
for security, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO accession is also about returning Hungary to her natural
habitat,'' Martonyi said. ``It has been our manifest destiny to
rejoin those with whom we share the same values, interests and
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronislaw Geremek of Poland invoked Winston Churchill's 1946
``Iron Curtain'' declaration in Fulton, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, with joy and pride, we celebrate the end of the bipolar
world symbolized by the Iron Curtain,'' Geremek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for Poland as well as for millions of
Poles scattered all over the world. Poland forever returns where
she has always belonged, in the free world. Poland is no longer
alone in the defense of her freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that lasted almost 30 minutes, Albright welcomed the
three nations to a new era of self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never again will your fates be tossed around like poker chips
on a bargaining table,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of NATO expansion, Albright added, was a sign that
``we have not grown complacent about protecting the security of our
citizens. The nations entering our alliance today are the first new
members since the Cold War's end, but they will not be the last.
For NATO enlargement is not an event, it is a process.''
</P>
<P>
   In her address, Albright did not discuss specifically the
current negotiations concerning the possible use of U.S. troops as
part of a potential NATO peacekeeping operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks after the ceremony, however, Kavan of the Czech
Republic remained hopeful that the discussions between U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would
be fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO could contribute to peace in Kosovo, it could be a
great thing for the Balkans, Europe and the world,'' he said. ``One
obviously has to be prepared for failure, but at the moment let's
hope we shall not be confronted with a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit began at 10:25 a.m., when Albright and the three
foreign ministers arrived at Kansas City's Downtown Airport on an
Air Force One 707 jet.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver was at the runway to greet
them. Limousines, with police motorcades at their side, then
whisked the ministers to the Truman Library.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived back at Downtown Airport at 3:23 p.m. and boarded
their plane, which took off 10 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the Truman Library ceremony were U.S. Reps. Karen
McCarthy and Ike Skelton of Missouri, as well as U.S. Sen. Barbara
Mikulski of Maryland, who introduced Albright.
</P>
<P>
   For the accession ceremony, Truman Library museum staff members
reached into their collection for the small table on which Harry S.
Truman, in May 1947 at the Hotel Muehlebach in Kansas City, signed
documents authorizing $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey,
which set the stage for the restabilization of Europe after World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusual day for the library, which was closed to the
public. Several television trucks lined the drive in front of the
library's front door, and members of the foreign press filled the
gymnasium at the University of Missouri-Kansas City's nearby Truman
campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a renewed respect for NATO,'' Truman Library Director
Larry Hackman announced as the ceremony began. ``I understand now
what it is like to be invaded.''

HOSPITAL, DOCTORS GROUP AGREE TO SETTLE FRAUD ALLEGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Truman Medical Center and a related doctors
group have agreed to pay the federal government $242,500 to settle
allegations of Medicare fraud, U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill Jr.
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said Truman and Hospital Hill Health Services Corp. agreed
to pay the money to settle a civil lawsuit over allegedly
fraudulent billings for tests performed on elderly and low-income
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Truman and Hospital Hill Health Services, which employs the
doctors who practice at Truman, also have promised to cooperate
with the government in a separate but related criminal
investigation into alleged health-care fraud activities at the
hospital, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Chris Whitley said the U.S. attorney's office could
not comment on the criminal investigation except to say that it was
related to the civil case.
</P>
<P>
   John Bluford, executive director and chief executive officer of
Truman, said in a phone interview late Friday from his current home
in Minnesota that Medicare and Medicaid billings involve 12,000
different codes for different procedures that must be correctly
matched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tedious,'' Bluford said. ``All the services billed were
provided. The question involves how they were documented. I don't
think there was any intentional fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Friday, Truman stated that it and Hospital
Hill Health Services agreed to the settlement ``to avoid the
expense and uncertainty of the legal process. We have cooperated
and will continue to cooperate fully with the government's
investigation into Medicare and Medicaid billing issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, announced Friday, is the latest example of a
nationwide crackdown on fraud in government medical insurance
programs such as Medicare, which serves 39 million elderly and
disabled beneficiaries and faces the danger of financial collapse
in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The government contended that Truman and Hospital Hill Health
Services billed and received payments from Medicare for
electro-cardiogram and echo-cardiography tests to screen or ``rule
out'' diagnoses, or as part of pre-operative procedures. Medicare
does not allow such billings, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew
J. Lay, who negotiated the civil settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said: ``The conduct as we alleged was not simply a
situation involving paperwork mistakes or the hospital's inability
to understand the appropriate regulations. This was a deliberate,
methodical and sustained scheme to file fraudulent claims to
defraud Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   The government said the alleged violations occurred at Truman's
Hospital Hill campus and at Truman Medical Center East from about
January 1994 through December 1996, before the current
administration at Truman was in place.Bluford stepped in as
Truman's executive director and chief executive officer March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bluford replaced E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr., who came to Truman
in November 1996 and left last year. Anderson's predecessor was Jim
Mongan, who headed the medical center from 1981 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Mongan could not be reached for comment Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Truman's news release said the investigation showed that medical
services provided to patients were ``necessary and appropriate. The
issues investigated relate to whether the bills in question were
prepared with the correct description and billing codes.''
</P>
<P>
   The release from Truman also stated that Truman and Hospital
Hill Health Services have instituted measures, such as employee
training sessions, ``to ensure to the fullest extent possible these
types of billing errors will not happen in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil allegations against Truman and Hospital Hill Health
Services were stated in a federal lawsuit filed under seal in
federal court in Kansas City in July 1997. The lawsuit and
settlement agreement were unsealed and made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The civil complaint and settlement do not specify how much
Medicare paid for the allegedly fraudulent billings, Whitley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bluford declined to give a specific figure but said the amount
of the billings and the level of alleged inaccuracies were
``minuscule and insignificant in the context of the tens of
thousands of transactions we do every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitley countered: ``Perhaps it's true that viewed in the
context of the hospital's total billings for services, this would
seem small. But it is in fact a very significant case.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluford added that many services from many health care providers
were probably underbilled because of the complexities of billing
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement with Truman comes at a critical time for the
medical center's facilities, which are operated by a nonprofit
corporation and function as Kansas City's and Jackson County's
``safety net'' hospitals, providing treatment for many indigent
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing financial demands and shrinking government
subsidies, Truman is trying to break even during its current fiscal
year, which ends April 30.
</P>
<P>
   During its latest fiscal year, Truman received 15 percent of its
revenue from Medicare and 63 percent from Medicaid. Truman gets $32
million a year from city and county tax levies and may ask for
more.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Kansas City health care community hope Bluford,
former head of Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, can
put Truman on stronger financial footing.

YEHUDI MENUHIN, VIOLINIST, CONDUCTOR, HUMANITARIAN, DIES AT AGE
82 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANTRELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Yehudi Menuhin, one of the most beloved figures in
20th-century classical music, died Friday at age 82.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin, who made his name as a great violinist before
developing an estimable career as an orchestral conductor, died of
heart failure in a Berlin hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Berlin to conduct the Warsaw Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Born April 22, 1916, in New York to Russian Jewish parents,
Menuhin was all of 7 when he made his professional debut in San
Francisco. He created a stir in New York two years later and a
sensation in Paris in 1927. He then began off-and-on study with the
great Romanian violinist and composer George Enescu, who was to be
his most important mentor.
</P>
<P>
   A 1927 New York performance of the Beethoven Violin Concerto,
with conductor Fritz Busch, made Menuhin an international
celebrity. He made his first recordings the next year, and his
magnificent 1932 recording of the violin concerto by Edward Elgar,
with the composer conducting, became one of the most famous in
history. Rarely out of print since its initial release, it's now
available on a compact disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tremendously elegant playing,'' says John Adams,
principal violist of the Kansas City Symphony. ``While it was
certainly emotional, it was very elegant and very pure.''
</P>
<P>
   Although obviously gifted with great natural facility, Menuhin
in later years wasn't always the tidiest player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the great violinists,'' says Tiberius Klausner,
concertmaster of the Kansas City Symphony and emeritus professor of
violin at the University of Missouri-Kansas City Conservatory of
Music. ``There is no question about it. But later, his problems
showed. His bow arm was shaking and his intonation was not
reliable. In the last years he probably should not have played.''
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin had a lifelong concern with humanitarian issues. During
World War II he gave more than 500 concerts for American and Allied
troops. In 1947 he became the first Jewish artist to play with the
Berlin Philharmonic after the overthrow of the Nazi regime.
Criticized in some circles for doing so, he said he wanted to
further ideas of tolerance and ``the brotherhood of man.''
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin settled in London in 1959, but didn't become a British
citizen until 1985. Awarded an honorary knighthood in 1965, he
became Lord Menuhin in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, in 1938, was to Nola Nicholas, daughter of
an Australian millionaire. They had one son and a daughter before
being divorced in 1947. Later that year, Menuhin married ballerina
Diana Gould, with whom he had two more sons.
</P>
<P>
   It was during his tenure as director of the Bath Festival in
England, between 1958 and 1968, that Menuhin began to make a name
as a conductor. He and the festival orchestra toured throughout the
world and made pioneering recordings of baroque music.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin eventually gave up playing to devote his attention to
conducting, appearing with leading orchestras all over the world.
Among his notable later recordings was a second one of the Elgar
Violin Concerto. This time, five decades after his collaboration
with the conductor, Menuhin was on the podium, with the Russian
violinist Dmitry Sitkovetsky as soloist.
</P>
<P>
   Musical education was another cause close to Menuhin's heart. He
promoted the teaching of music in English schools and founded a
boarding school for musically talented children and a foundation in
Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin's enthusiasms went beyond classical music. He became
interested in Indian music and philosophy, and pioneered what now
is called crossover by performing and recording with the Indian
sitar master Ravi Shankar. He also performed with the French jazz
violinist Stephane Grappelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just such a sincere man,'' said Adams, who heard
Menuhin perform numerous times and once met him. ``There was such
sincerity in everything he did _ his teaching, his research into
Indian music. He influenced a lot of people just by being what he
was, almost as much as by what he did.''

SCIENTISTS ANNOUNCE BREAKTHROUGHS IN BRAIN IMAGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ Imagine being able to watch a human brain as it
thinks: To see on a computer screen the cascade of electrical
signals that run through the brain as it sees a person, remembers
who he is and decides whether to wave ``hello.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the University of Missouri-Columbia and at
Washington University in St. Louis said Friday they have assembled
an array of technology that may ultimately unlock many such secrets
of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference on the MU campus, they presented a new device
developed at MU that uses low-powered laser light shot through
holes in a motorcycle helmet to look into the brain. The Event
Related Optical Signal (EROS) scanner is uniquely capable of
pinpointing where and when brain activity occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the verge of actually understanding how the brain as
a whole works,'' said Ed Maclin, an MU research psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers hope to use EROS and more conventional
technology to learn not only how a normal brain works, but also to
discover the sources of the many disorders that plague the mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to fight an enemy (mental illness) you can't see,''
MU psychologist Steve Hackley said. ``This will make it as easy to
see sickness in the mind as it is to see a broken bone in the
body.''
</P>
<P>
   Although practical applications for patients are still far in
the future, the research, which involves dozens of researchers
collaborating at the two universities, may eventually yield many
medical benefits. For example, the technology may one day make it
possible to:
</P>
<P>
   - Locate crucial areas of language and memory that a surgeon
should avoid in brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   - Determine the exact causes of a learning or attention deficit
disorder in children so that the most appropriate treatment is
given.
</P>
<P>
   - Diagnose whether newly noticed forgetfulness is early
Alzheimer's disease or normal aging.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at several other universities in the United States
and abroad also are working on EROS technology. The researchers in
Columbia on Friday called EROS a major advance because it allows
them to see how a stimulus, such as a sound or a picture on a
computer screen, triggers a sequence of events in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The EROS computer produces a map of the brain that flashes in
bright reds and yellows on a computer screen when a portion of the
brain is activated.
</P>
<P>
   ``By knowing how a sequence lights up you really get a glimpse
about how thinking works,'' MU psychologist Monica Fabiani said.
</P>
<P>
   Scans by magnetic resonance imaging, like those done in
hospitals, produce the clearest anatomical images of the interior
of the brain. And a special MRI technique called functional MRI, or
fMRI, can locate brain activity by revealing parts of the brain
where blood circulation increases.
</P>
<P>
   But fMRI doesn't have the speed required to follow quick shifts
in brain activity. That's because the surge in blood flow the fMRI
detects may take 10 or 12 seconds, far longer than the instant it
takes the eye to send an image to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   EROS scans measure the actual activity of nerve cells and can
make images of what occurs in a thousandth of a second.
</P>
<P>
   That permits scientists to see split-second shifts in the
location of brain activity, such as the rapid firing of neurons
during an epileptic seizure.
</P>
<P>
   EROS subjects wear a motorcycle helmet with hundreds of holes
drilled through. Depending on which parts of the brain the
researchers want to study, they insert fiber optic cables into the
helmet holes. A laser shines infrared light through the cables. The
light is at a frequency that is not readily absorbed by brain
tissue so that the brain is somewhat transparent and lets some of
the light through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bouncing light through the brain. This is `Star
Trek'-like technology,'' Washington University researcher Randy
Buckner said.
</P>
<P>
   When neurons in the brain are activated, they become more
transparent to the EROS laser light. The light then travels farther
through the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Light reflected off brain tissue is picked up by other helmet
cables attached to sensors. A computer then gauges time and
location of brain activity.
</P>
<P>
   Fabiani said she is about to begin an EROS study on the effect
of aging on memory. By next year, there may be other studies
involving children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also have used a computer to superimpose the EROS
images onto the clearer brain images made by MRI. This creates
revealing pictures of the brain in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of technologies is the future'' of brain
research, said Gabriele Gratton, an MU psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   While MU and Washington University have been collaborating
informally on brain imaging research, researchers at the two
schools hope to create a joint research center, Gratton said.
Washington University is a recognized leader in fMRI research,
while MU has made the greatest advances in EROS, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a collaborative research center has received
tentative approval from administrators on both campuses, Gratton
said. The next step is to attract funding from government agencies,
foundations or other sources, he said.

   MEXICO-BARTLETT _ PUEBLA, Mexico _ Among the many books in the
governor's mansion here, Manuel Bartlett kept a copy of ``The
Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs.'' It was an amusing choice
of reading for a man now struggling to overcome an image as one of
Mexico's own most endangered species. Bartlett -- who wants to be
Mexico's next president -- is one of this country's ``dinosaurs,''
the not-so-affectionate nickname for the old, authoritarian guard
of the Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI, which has
controlled Mexico's presidency for 70 years. A career politician
and recent governor of Puebla state, Bartlett represents the past
to Mexicans who believe he engineered old-fashioned electoral fraud
and other anti-democratic evils. But this shrewd politician claims
he's the PRI's best bet to hang onto the presidency in July 2000,
when Mexicans go to the polls in the most competitive presidential
election in Mexican history. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH

   PALM BEACH SMUGGLING SERIES
</P>
<P>
   EDs: The Palm Beach Post has a three-day package for Saturday,
March 13, Sunday, March 14, and Monday, March 15, on the business
of smuggling aliens; why the U.S. Border Patrol, the INS and the
federal court system cope poorly with it in Florida; and why
Florida employers are able to hire hundreds of thousands of illegal
workers each year. Here are the budget lines for the second day in
the series. STORIES HAVE MOVED. FOUR PHOTOS AND FOUR GRAPHICS ARE
AVAILABLE.
</P>
<P>
   SMUGGLE-MAIN _ WEST PALM, BEACH, Fla. _ Smuggling immigrants
into Florida is a money-making enterprise. It's becoming a booming
business as more and more immigrants find that paying smugglers
equipped with fast boats and high-tech gear improves their chances
of reaching the United States. Sometimes it goes wrong, as when 40
Haitians drowned between the Bahamas and Palm Beach County last
weekend. The Border Patrol is charged with the responsibility of
putting the alien smuggler out of business. But the Miami sector
has less than 60 agents to patrol its four-state region. The agency
hasn't seen an increase in its workforce in 10 years. During that
period, the U.S. Border Patrol has experienced dramatic growth,
doubling the number of agents to a force of nearly 8,000.
Unfortunately for the Miami sector, almost all of the thousands of
agents hired during the past few years have been assigned to Texas,
California, New Mexico and Arizona. For example: The Miami Sector
has 52 agents assigned; Laredo (Texas) has 638; El Paso has 9,752;
Tucson has 1,022; and San Diego has 2,257. Miami's budget is $6.2
million; San Diego is $178 million. (Kane, Palm Beach Post) 60

<P>
   SMUGGLE-NIGHT _ Border Patrol Agent Larry Belotti works the
graveyard shift. He says he's the often the only Border Patrol
agent working from Corpus Christi, Texas, to Vermont. One recent
night, he rounded up 26 Cubans who came ashore in Miami Beach. This
effectively shuts down the Border Patrol station because Belotti
will spend the rest of the night processing these refugees. 30
inches. (Kane, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   SMUGGLE-PUNISH _ U.S. Attorney Tom Scott says his office is
adopting an aggressive stand against alien smugglers. These cases
are tough to prosecute, particularly when Cuban refugees are
involved. Justice Department data shows that federal prosecutors
historically haven't taken on many alien smuggling cases. A couple
reasons. The smugglees make lousy witnesses. There's also the
built-in defense: ``I'm not a smuggler. I was fishing and rescued
these Cubans from their sinking raft.'' Prosecutors also have felt
that juries of Cuban exiles and other immigrants find it hard to
convict someone of helping their fellow countrymen escape
oppression. Furthermore, the courts haven't been very tough on
convicted smugglers, even if the case involves the deaths of
refugees. For example: In South Fla, the USAtty prosecuted 62
percent of cases referred by the Border Patrol; in Arizona, 92
percent; in Southern California, 99 percent; in South Texas, 99
percent. In South Fla, 26 percent of smuggling cases referred to
USAtty ended with prison sentences; in Arizona, it's 40 percent;
Southern California, 57 percent; South Texas, 58 percent. 60
inches. (Kane, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   SMUGGLE-CASES _ Seven case studies. (Kane, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   FOR MONDAY (Moved today):
</P>
<P>
   SMUGGLE-WORKSITE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's unlawful to hire
non-citizens. But Florida is still the land of opportunity. An
estimated 350,000 illegal aliens reside here. Most work in the
vegetable and citrus farms. Many keep the tourism industry booming
as waiters, hotel maids, etc. Some work on landscaping and
construction crews. But the INS cannot go into the agricultural
fields and doesn't have the manpower to do much other worksite
enforcement because it has to focus attention on alien smuggling.
Farmers hire scores of illegal workers and escape liability by
paying licensed farm labor contractors provide crews. They also
argue that workers today carry counterfeit documents. The INS says
they don't expect growers to be document experts. Migrant worker
advocates argue that farmers use their political clout to handcuff
the INS. For example: in 1990, the INS sanctioned 38 employers in
Florida for hiring illegals. That dropped to 16 in 1991, 6 in 1992
and 2 in 1993. In 1994, 1995 and 1996, it was a dozen or fewer.
Only in 1997 did it get back up to about 20-25 employers.

ADVICE FOR FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At times, the struggle to become a first-time homeowner seems
like learning to ride a bicycle: You can't help but wonder how
something that seems to have been so easy for others could be so
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But perseverance apparently pays. A survey by the Chicago Title
Corp. found that more than 46 percent of home purchases nationwide
in 1998 were made by first-time buyers. In New York City, the
survey found, 52 percent of home sales in 1998 were made to
first-time buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The combination in recent months of low interest rates and
intense competition among mortgage lenders has been making home
ownership possible for increasing numbers of first-time buyers,
real estate brokers and lenders say.
</P>
<P>
   And offerings like a new mortgage program that allows buyers to
put as little as 3 percent down for a ``handyman's special'' _ and
include the cost of anticipated repairs in the mortgage _ are
making home ownership possible for first-time buyers of more modest
means.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a first home, though, is a bit like buying a custom-made
suit: it may not have to fit perfectly forever, but it sure should
fit nicely now. What follows are some tips, strategies and cautions
offered by brokers, mortgage specialists, lawyers and others with
long experience in real estate for finding the best fit for the
first-time home-buyer's dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first piece of advice I give first-time buyers is to
figure out how much house they can honestly afford,'' said Jack
Hopkins, an associate broker at Harbor Gates Realty in Greenlawn,
N.Y. ``The second is to figure out what kind of house they want to
live in.''
</P>
<P>
   While both suggestions may seem obvious, Hopkins said, it is not
uncommon for those in search of a first home to spend a lot of time
looking at houses they cannot afford. And all that does, the Long
Island broker said, is make it more difficult to be satisfied with
houses within their range.
</P>
<P>
   Finding an affordable house, however, does not always mean
finding a less expensive one. ``I always explain to first-time
buyers that you can work property taxes against the price of the
house to end up with more house for your money,'' Hopkins said,
explaining that a relatively small savings on annual property taxes
can create a sizeable increase in the price of the house one can
afford. ``I show them that at today's interest rates, paying $1,000
a year less in property taxes will enable them to buy a house worth
$12,000 more,'' he said; the increase in buying power comes from
having more money available each month to pay the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hopkins said, someone buying a $150,000 house with
a $135,000 mortgage with a fixed rate of 7.5 percent interest for
30 years would have a monthly mortgage payment of $943.93.
</P>
<P>
   If the property taxes on the house are $5,000, he said, that
would add $416.66 to the monthly payment, resulting in a total
monthly payment of $1,360.59.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the annual taxes on the house are $4,000 instead of
$5,000 _ a difference of $83.33 a month _ the purchaser could
borrow an additional $12,000 and have the same monthly payment of
$1,360.59.
</P>
<P>
   Some buyers, Hopkins said, particularly young married couples,
spend too much time looking at houses they might be able to afford
but that one or the other doesn't like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many times I'll sit down with couples who
come into my office and find out that neither knows what the other
wants,'' he said, adding that he encourages each to articulate
``the house of their dreams'' to the other, at times using drawings
and cartoons of various kinds of houses to get the conversation
flowing with specific examples. And even if they are far apart, he
said, knowing what the other wants makes it easier to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   A willingness to compromise is, of course, essential. ``You have
to keep an open mind,'' said Gina Guarnieri, a resident of
Bronxville, N.Y., who, with her husband, Andrew Ripps, visited more
than 50 properties before finding one they both liked in Cortlandt
Manor in Westchester County. Like many first-time home-buyers, Ms.
Guarnieri and Ripps started their search with higher expectations
than they eventually realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to try and stay in lower Westchester,'' Ms.
Guarnieri said, explaining that since both she and Ripps work in
Manhattan, they wanted their commute to be as convenient as
possible. But since home prices in Westchester generally increase
as commuting times decrease, the couple found that they would have
to head farther north in the county to get the most house for their
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to find exactly what you want,'' Ms.
Guarnieri said. ``There's always going to be something you're going
to have to sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said, location is not the only thing to keep an
open mind about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I would have preferred a Victorian or a colonial,''
Ms. Guarnieri said, adding that her husband preferred a more
contemporary home. Both were surprised, then, when they walked into
a 2,400 square-foot, three-bedroom contemporary-style home in
Cortlandt Manor priced at $324,900 and she experienced the moment
first-time home-buyers yearn for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called it `The Feeling,''' Ms. Guarnieri said, that
undefinable sense that the house is just the right fit.
</P>
<P>
   And while the couple is negotiating with the owner and declined
to say what they are willing to pay, they entered negotiations with
a distinct advantage over less-savvy first-time buyers: They have
already been approved for a mortgage. ``One of the most important
things a first-time buyer can do is get pre-approved for a
mortgage,'' said Peter Bell, chief operating officer of Balch
Buyers Realty in Mamaroneck, N.Y., the company that helped Ms.
Guarnieri and Ripps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about pre-qualification, I'm talking about
getting an actual commitment from a lender for a specific amount of
money,'' Bell said, adding that obtaining pre-approval from a
lender will not only give first-time buyers an indisputable idea of
what they can afford _ it may also give them an edge over other
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in a market where it's not unusual for sellers to
get several full-price offers,'' he said. ``And when they have to
choose one buyer over another, they're probably going to pick the
one who already has a mortgage lined up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kay Gallagher, an independent real estate broker in the
Prospect Park South neighborhood of Brooklyn, said that applying
for a mortgage before starting to look for a house could result in
a pleasant surprise for some buyers. ``I'm finding that people can
usually afford more than they think they can afford,'' Ms.
Gallagher said. ``I think it's because of the combination of low
interest rates and banks being willing to lend more money with less
money down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the not-too-distant-past, she said, sellers would get
skittish about going into contract with a buyer with a low down
payment, fearing that the buyer would ultimately not be able to get
a mortgage. That fear is eliminated, however, if the buyer's
mortgage has already been approved, no matter how low the down
payment may be.
</P>
<P>
   And how low is low?
</P>
<P>
   ``First-time buyers can get into a house with as little as 3
percent down,'' said John Minicozzi, a loan specialist with Norwest
Mortgage in Wayne, N.J. ``And in some cases, you can even borrow
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a program sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, prospective buyers who want to save money by
purchasing a handyman's special, hoping to improve the property
while they own it, can now include the anticipated cost of the
improvements in the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great deal for first-time buyers,'' Minicozzi said,
explaining that the program, known as Section 203(k), can be used
to rehabilitate significantly deteriorated property or to make
repairs or capital improvements in properties that just need
upgrading. Section 203(k) mortgages have no income or geographical
limitations, he said, and can be used for one- to four-family
dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   The down payment required under the program, Minicozzi said, is
3 percent. The total mortgage, which is based on the anticipated
improved value of the property, cannot exceed FHA loan limits for
the area where the property is situated. In New York City and
Westchester and Rockland Counties, Fairfield County in Connecticut
and Bergen County in New Jersey, the maximum 203(k) loan is
$208,800 for a one-family house and $401,375 for a four-family.
</P>
<P>
   A similar mortgage product _ offered through lenders approved by
Fannie Mae, a congressionally chartered, shareholder-owned
corporation that is the nation's largest source of residential
mortgage funds _ allows buyers to obtain mortgages up to current
Fannie Mae limits.
</P>
<P>
   Those limits range from $240,000 for a one-family house to
$461,350 for a four-family. The borrowers may apply up to 50
percent of the financing to repairs and structural alterations and
to nonessential items like sun rooms, swimming pools, saunas and
even hot tubs.
</P>
<P>
   Raschelle Burton, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae, said that the
minimum down payment for such loans is 5 percent. Another Fannie
Mae program, Flexible 97, allows buyers to obtain mortgages with as
little as 3 percent down _ and that 3 percent can be a gift from a
family member.
</P>
<P>
   But what can a first-time buyer do if there are no potential
benefactors in the family? ``You might be able to borrow some money
from yourself,'' said Saul Simon, a certified financial planner in
Edison, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, Simon said, a person who has a 401(k)
retirement plan can borrow 50 percent of the plan balance, up to
$50,000, and use it for a down payment on a house, no matter how
the mortgage is obtained.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not paying any penalty because you're taking the money
as a loan,'' he said. ``Then you pay yourself back at 5 or 6
percent interest and amortize the repayment over five years. It's a
great technique.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't want to borrow money, even from themselves,
because it will increase their monthly expenses and so decrease the
maximum mortgage they can qualify for, there is another option.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person with an Individual Retirement Account can withdraw up
to $10,000 without paying a penalty, and then use the money as a
down payment on a house,'' Simon said. ``It's only available for
first-time home buyers,'' he said, adding that the withdrawn money
is taxable and must be reported as ordinary income.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Daly, an associate broker with Prudential Rand Real
Estate in Nanuet, N.Y., said that many first-time buyers believe
that the best mortgage for them is an adjustable-rate loan. But,
she said, such mortgages, which have a low introductory interest
rate that can increase after as little as one year, are a risky
proposition in today's market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates are so reasonable today that most people are
much better off with a fixed-rate loan,'' Ms. Daly said. ``At least
you know your payments are going to remain the same no matter what
happens to the interest rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith T. Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage
publishing company in Butler, N.J., agreed. ``The interest rate on
one-year adjustables is about 5.8 percent today,'' Gumbinger said,
about 1.3 percentage points lower than the current rate for 30-year
fixed-rate loans.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, under the terms of most adjustable-rate
mortgage agreements, that 5.8 percent will likely jump to 7.5
percent next year, even if interest rates on fixed-rate loans
remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adjustables are usually worthwhile only when the difference
between the 30-year fixed rate and the one-year adjustable is 2.25
percent or more,'' he said. ``That at least provides you with some
fairly substantial savings in the first year and a bit of a cushion
in the second.''
</P>
<P>
   Some new programs reduce the cost of Private Mortgage Insurance,
which is generally required when the down payment is less than 20
percent. The Mortgage Guarantee Insurance Corp. in Milwaukee allows
borrowers to reduce their monthly insurance payments by including
part of the insurance cost in the mortgage. And Fannie Mae's
``Lowest Cost M.I.'' program, available from lenders who use its
Desktop Underwriter system, allows borrowers to make down payments
of as little as 5 or 10 percent without having to buy PMI.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, innovative mortgage programs won't help a first-time
buyer with bad credit _ right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not so,'' said Gerri Detweiler, education adviser for Debt
Counselors of America, a nonprofit debt counseling agency based in
Rockville, Md. Ms. Detweiler said that even those with negative
marks on their credit _ late payments, repossessions, liens,
judgments and even bankruptcy _ can get a mortgage if they have
sufficient income.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, mortgage lenders only wrote A loans,'' Ms.
Detweiler said, explaining that such loans _ typically available
only to borrowers with excellent credit _ usually carry the best
interest rates and require the lowest down payments.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, increasing numbers of lenders have
been writing what are known as B, C and D loans for borrowers with
credit histories ranging anywhere from marred to horrible.
</P>
<P>
   And while such loans generally require significant down payments
and carry higher-than-average interest rates, she said, their
availability makes it possible for even those with terrible credit
to buy a house.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what a prospective buyer thinks his or her credit
history is, Ms. Detweiler said, it is always prudent to call one of
the three nationwide credit reporting agencies _ Equifax,
TransUnion or Experion _ and request a credit report. The typical
fee is $8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, you should do this six to eight weeks before you plan
to get pre-approved,'' Ms. Detweiler said, explaining that if
incorrect information is contained in the report, the borrower
should obtain reports from the other agencies to see if the mistake
is repeated and then advise each agency of all errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a form included with the report that can be used
to dispute any incorrect information,'' she said. ``Fill out the
form and send it in as soon as possible because mistakes don't get
fixed overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   For negative items that are not removed or credit blotches that
are accurate, she said, it is typically worthwhile for the borrower
to send the agency a statement giving the borrower's side of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're allowed by law to have a 100-word statement added to
your credit report,'' she said. ``Just be sure to make it
straightforward, honest and factual.''
</P>
<P>
   Once first-time buyers have decided what kind of house they're
looking for and where they are going to look for it, and once the
best available financing is in place, the only thing left is start
looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest mistake first-time buyers make is buying as the
result of an emotional decision,'' said Enid Hamelin, director of
advertising and public relations for Lawrence Properties, a
Manhattan brokerage company. ``They walk into a house or apartment
and the first thing they do is visualize where the nursery is going
to be and what it will look like.''
</P>
<P>
   And while getting ``the feeling'' about a particular house or
apartment is undoubtedly important, Ms. Hamelin said, it is just as
important to keep in mind that buying property is an investment.
``This is business,'' she said. ``And one has to do one's
homework.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Hamelin said, a prospective purchaser looking
at a co-op or condominium apartment should try to talk to as many
people in the building as possible _ particularly the
superintendent or other building employees _ to obtain as much
first-hand information as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Those buying houses, she said, should make a trip to the
buildings department in the town where the property is situated and
ask to see whatever documentation is on file for the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might find out that your dream house is built on a
landfill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important things a buyer can do, she said _
particularly a first-time buyer who may not be familiar with how a
house works _ is hire a competent engineer to inspect the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want somebody who is going to do a hands-on inspection,''
she said. ``You want the house inspected inside and outside, from
top to bottom. You want an inspector who will be able to tell you
exactly what you're buying.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   House inspections can cost from several hundred dollars to
$1,000, Ms. Hamelin said, depending on the type and location of the
property.
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Heimer, president of Heimer Engineering in Huntington
Station, N.Y., said that a similar price range applies to co-ops
and condominiums. While such inspections cannot cover a building's
structural details, he said, they are nevertheless important
because they emphasize items unique to the apartment. Andrew
Brodnick, a White Plains real estate lawyer, said that it is also
important for first-time buyers to accompany the engineer or
inspector while the inspection is being performed. That, he said,
will allow the buyer to ask specific questions about appliances and
systems in the house. In addition, he said, it would be very
helpful for a buyer to obtain a copy of the survey for the property
and ask the engineer to walk the property lines with the survey in
hand and the buyer in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to think you own a section of property that really
belongs to your neighbor,'' Brodnick said, adding that a buyer
should also determine, with the help of the lawyer who will handle
the closing, whether there are existing easements or rights-of-way
that give others use or access to the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen easements where the next-door neighbor has a right
to use a driveway but has no obligation to plow it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Billingsley, an owner of Frances Billingsley Realty in
Katonah, N.Y., said that first-time buyers looking in an area they
are not familiar with should drive around the neighborhood _ a lot
_ at different times of day. ``Drive into town one way and out
another,'' Billingsley said. ``Drive around at 8 o'clock on a
Monday morning to find out where the traffic is and drive around on
Friday night to find out where the teenagers hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   And once zeroed in on a particular house, he said, get out of
the car and walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knock on the neighbors' doors, talk to them, find out what
they like about the neighborhood and what they don't like about
it,'' he said. ``If you're moving into a development, talk to
people who live there and ask if there are any problems with the
houses. They'll probably be able to tell you something the broker
doesn't even know.''
</P>
<P>
   If, after all that, Mr. Billingsley said, a house still seems
right, be decisive. ``In this market you've got to move quickly,''
he said. ``I know many a person who has found a house they love,
but then gone and seen a couple of dozen more only to come back and
find the first house already in contract.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, he said, every buyer should resist the urge to be
``penny wise and pound foolish'' when negotiating in a seller's
market. ``I've seen quarter-million-dollar sales fall apart over a
$250 chandelier,'' Mr. Billingsley said. ``If the seller wants to
take the chandelier, let them have it. You can always buy
another.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, March 14:
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos seems to feel bad, in retrospect, that he
did not press Bill Clinton harder about what went on with Gennifer
Flowers before jumping to his candidate's defense. ``I needed
Clinton to see me as his defender, not his interrogator, which made
me, of course, an enabler,'' he writes in his new memoir, ``All Too

   Ambivalence and regret are the two main emotional chords in the
book, but in this case Stephanopoulos seems to be beating himself
up unnecessarily. Throughout American history, when a bimbo
eruption has hit an American presidential campaign, the last thing
a candidates' aides have considered doing is asking the Big Guy for
the real story.
</P>
<P>
   When Grover Cleveland was accused of having an illegitimate
child, he ordered his advisers to ``tell the truth'' and went off
to sulk for the rest of the campaign. Nobody ran after him to ask
exactly what the truth was supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos' treatment of the Clintons seems pretty
evenhanded, even though, like almost everyone connected to the
Clintons who did not leave the administration under indictment, he
left clutching a prescription for anti-depressants. ``All Too
Human'' is not the sort of book that is going to make the younger
generation yearn for a career as White House communications
director.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the insider's tell-all has many critics, who
believe that a president cannot be effective if he feels he is
surrounded by a roomful of future memoirists. ``It's like trying to
govern on national TV,'' says Jody Powell, the Carter
administration press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton White House would, of course, be a happier place
today if the president always had conducted himself as if there
were a film crew in the room. Besides, by the time Stephanopoulos
got around to publishing, the president and his wife had been
trashed by so many books, depositions and Congressional proceedings
that it is hard to imagine what secret he could have disclosed that
would have made any additional impact.
</P>
<P>
   White House insider memoirs are almost always less damaging than
anticipated because the people who write them are almost always
people who want to be taken seriously, and they tend to write
serious books. A Secretary of Defense pouring his heart out to a
computer generally errs on the side of telling too little. The
employee you really have to worry about is the one with no
delusions of grandeur _ if presidents are going to indulge in
self-censorship, they should probably start with the dog walker and
backstairs maids.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 15 years, White House aides have become authors
with the same regularity that defeated congressmen turn into
lobbyists. While Stephanopoulos' $2.8-million advance raised some
eyebrows, it was not as much, adjusting for inflation, as David
Stockman, Ronald Reagan's former budget director, got for ``The
Triumph of Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The tome Stockman produced turned out to be tabloid fodder only
for the Congressional Quarterly crowd. Stockman's biggest
revelation was that Reagan was not very interested in the budget
process. It differed from the memoirs that followed only in that
Stockman did not blame Nancy Reagan for the federal deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton could not be less alike, and it
is interesting that the two of them seem to have inspired a similar
eagerness on the part of their top appointees to start typing as
soon as they were out the door. The reason may simply be that these
presidents stayed in office longest, outlasting their ex-aides'
patience.
</P>
<P>
   But they also managed, in very different ways, to leave their
former associates feeling betrayed. Clinton promised one thing,
then did another. Reagan was a man whose charm was equaled by his
disassociation from the people around him. Aides who had labored on
his behalf for years sometimes came to realize that he barely knew
their names, let alone what they had done. (That emotional distance
was painfully apparent long before Reagan showed symptoms of
Alzheimer's disease, and was possibly the reason his administration
boasts a list of tell-all authors that includes the president's own
offspring.)
</P>
<P>
   The most successful insider memoirist in recent presidential
history _ unless we are counting Barbara Bush's spaniel _ may have
been the former Reagan chief of staff Donald Regan, who revealed
the seminal role Mrs. Reagan's astrologer was playing in White
House planning.
</P>
<P>
   Regan had been dumped rather unceremoniously from his job,
unlike any of the Clinton-era memoirists thus far _ unless we are
counting Monica Lewinsky. The publishers apparently did not know
about the astrologer story when they signed Regan up, but they were
banking on what they had sensed of his mood. There was, Regan's
editor noted, a ``vendetta quality'' about their new author that
seemed promising.

<P>
   TEXARKANA, Ark. _ President Clinton said Saturday that recent
reports of police misconduct had shaken the public's faith in
police, and he proposed several measures that he said would help
restore that trust.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he would propose that Congress spend more
money to expand ethics training for police officers, establish
academies to build rapport between the police and citizens,
increase recruiting of minority police officers and put more police
officers on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been deeply disturbed by recent allegations of serious
police misconduct and continued reports of racial profiling that
have shaken some communities' faith in the police who are there to
protect them,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not specifically mention the recent killing of Amadou
Diallo in New York, or other questionable shootings of young blacks
by police officers in Pittsburgh and Riverside, Calif. But several
groups, including the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, have been urging him to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, a street peddler from Guinea, was killed on Feb. 4 in a
hail of 41 bullets outside his Bronx apartment by four white
policemen, touching off an outcry and reigniting concerns about the
police abuse of minorities. Since the shooting, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani of New York has started a $10 million drive to bring more
black and Hispanic officers into the police force.
</P>
<P>
   The president used his weekly radio talk Saturday to address the
issue. He taped the speech on Friday from the White House and
released it from here, where he was attending four Democratic
fund-raisers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would soon send to Congress a request for an
increase of $42 million for training state and local police and $5
million to establish what he called citizen police academies to
help build rapport between citizens and the police.
</P>
<P>
   The $42 million request includes $20 million to add ethics and
integrity training for police at the nation's 30 regional community
policing institutes. Only two of those institutes specialize in
providing such training.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that this training could help give
thousands of police officers ``the training best calculated to
prevent instances of police misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional $20 million would be devoted to making college
scholarships available to police officers.
</P>
<P>
   He would devote $2 million to improve the recruitment of
minority officers, doubling the money now available for such
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He would spend $5 million for the academies where people would
be able to learn police procedures so that they would understand
how police decisions are made, and police could be trained so they
could better understand citizens' concerns.

13 DEAD AFTER ATTACK IN BUSY STORE IN ISTANBUL
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Thirteen people were killed and three others
were injured Saturday in a bomb attack on a shopping center in an
outlying section of Istanbul, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No one immediately claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Several attacks have been made on civilian targets here in the
weeks since the capture of Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan
but none nearly as deadly as the one on Saturday, the most serious
in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's group has normally avoided attacks on civilian targets
in the western part of the country, though another group, known for
its Maoist orientation, has begun emerging. Militant Kurdish
factions claiming to fill the vacuum left by Ocalan's arrest have
also vowed to continue the armed struggle here.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, Saturday's attack was carried out by
three men who hurled a firebomb into the crowded shopping center in
the Goztepe section of Istanbul and then fled on foot. Goztepe lies
on the Asian side of the Bosporus waterway, which divides the city.
Like other neighborhoods there, it is far from areas frequented by
tourists but is often crowded with Turkish shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The shopping center, a modern five-story concrete and glass
building building, was gutted in the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is facing a trial that could lead to his execution.
Violent protests against his arrest have erupted in various
European cities. In Turkey, police have reinforced their presence
in Istanbul and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who perpetrated this attack will be caught,'' Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit vowed Saturday. ``They are trying to cause
panic during an election period.''
</P>
<P>
   Turks are scheduled to go to the polls to elect a new government
on April 18. Ecevit's position seems to have been strengthened by
the capture of Ocalan, the country's most wanted and most widely
hated fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Istanbul remained calm this week, and business and daily
life continued as usual. But the attacks carried out last week,
including one in which a taxi driver was killed, have already begun
to have an impact on the lucrative tourist trade. Hotel managers
and tour organizers reported that they have had cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors planning trips to Istanbul have asked their hosts
here when Ocalan's trial may take place. No date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   There have not yet been any attacks on Mediterranean towns where
much of the country's tourism is centered. If there are, the
country may suffer serious economic as well as political losses.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian and military leaders in Turkey have rejected
suggestions that they grant greater cultural rights to the Kurdish
minority as a way of heading off future protests and terrorist
attacks. They say that such concessions could lay the basis for a
national collapse like those that broke Yugoslavia and the Soviet
Union apart.

 &HT;    NBA EAST NOTES: The way of the Bison
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   And how was your week? Detroit center Bison Dele's wasn't so
hot.
</P>
<P>
   The former Brian Williams missed the team bus and had to take a
cab to a game in Orlando on March 6. He said he did not get his
wake-up call. Pistons PR chief Matt Dobek said he called Dele's
room and got no answer. Dele was fined $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   He played horribly that night, missing 11 of 17 shots and giving
up a season-high 23 to Ike Austin. The folks in Orlando were not
fooled by his name change _ they knew it was the guy they drafted
out of Arizona and watched struggle through two horrible seasons.
Every time he touched the ball they played the soundtrack of a cow
mooing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst place for me,'' Dele said. ``I have never
played well down there. Just too much bad blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday against the Wizards he was 1-for-5, and benched in the
fourth quarter of a close game. Wednesday, Dele was ejected from a
game in Washington. He got the boot from rookie ref Marc Davis in
the third. He grabbed a rebound and swung around, nearly hitting
Ben Wallace with his elbows. Davis thought the play was
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never touched him,'' Dele said. ``He called it for reading
my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   No fine for Iverson
</P>
<P>
   All that brotherly love is fading among Philadelphia's 76ers,
with under-performing Tim Thomas dealt to Milwaukee and Allen
Iverson blowing off practice without so much as an ``excuse me.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Brown revealed this isn't the first practice Iverson
has missed, and the maximum fine for a multiple offender can be as
much as $5,000 for each offense. However, after two team meetings
Friday, the Sixers' players said they were satisfied with their
teammate's excuse and voted not to discipline him. Iverson said he
missed practice because he was attending to his girlfriend, Tawanna
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My girl was sick,'' Iverson said. ``She had a miscarriage
recently. We've got kids TiauraAllen IIand I had to handle that.
I'll handle any repercussions. ... I called when it happened. I was
on my way out the door.''

 &HT;    League held hostage
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The underlying and disturbing reminder that came from the two
megatrades last week was this: The inmates not only are running the
asylum, they're running it into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In the cases of the Glen Rice trade to the Los Angeles Lakers
and Stephon Marbury to the New Jersey Nets, the key players
essentially held their old teams hostage, forcing the deals by
telling the clubs that no matter how much they offered, they would
not re-sign with them.
</P>
<P>
   So the Charlotte Hornets and Minnesota Timberwolves had no
alternative. The teams had to deal players they did not want to
trade to prevent losing them to free agency with nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   Some would argue that in a free enterprise system, employees
should be able to determine where they work. But that's not how the
NBA is supposed to function. With the average salary around $1.6
million, the league hardly exists as does, say, corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   There are guidelines set up to negotiate player movement. None
of them outline players' threats as a way of exacting change. And
yet, more and more it is heard: ``I'm going to test the free-agent
market, see what my value is. I love playing here, but I have to
see what's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That was more Marbury's deal than Rice's. A former Georgia Tech
star from Brooklyn, Marbury never liked Minneapolis and its frigid
winters and always wondered aloud about playing back home in his
native New York.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nets showed interest, Marbury basically said, ``That's
close enough. I'm outta here. See ya.'' Never mind that he and
Kevin Garnett represented one of the league's top young-gun tandems
or that the Timberwolves were 12-6 at the time of the trade.
Marbury held them up to go ``home'' to a Nets club that was
second-worst in the NBA (3-15) and in such disarray that it
contemplated firing its coach on the same day it traded for
Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the deal was none other than agent David Falk.
The thought was that Falk's power would be stripped with the new
collective bargaining agreement, which slots players' salaries by
their experience. And, indeed, Falk has been limited in what he can
do on that end of it.
</P>
<P>
   But he still has most of the game's big names, and it was he who
essentially set up both trades. Falk dealt with the Lakers, telling
them that Rice would approve the trade only if he received the kind
of money he wanted in a new contract. So, Rice didn't hold
Charlotte hostage so much as he did L.A. Falk told Minnesota's
owner that Marbury would not re-sign, and then brokered that deal
by insisting the Nets sign Marbury to the max he could receive.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a crazy way for business to be handled. But then, it's
always something crazy in an asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to restructure around players who are serious and
committed,'' Milwaukee coach George Karl said. ``We let too many
players blackmail us in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   BOX TO ACCOMPANY THE STORY
</P>
<P>
   LOWDOWN ON THE DEALS
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, B.J. Armstrong, J.R. Reid from Charlotte to L.A.
Lakers for Eddie Jones, Elden Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   -- Analysis: Lakers elevated to undisputed champion of talent in
NBA. Can Rice, Shaq and Kobe share the ball? Will Reid be a
suitable O'Neal backup? There are questions, but L.A. had to do it.
Charlotte got appreciably better but may not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Winner: Lakers, but not by much. Rice gives them dominance
inside (O'Neal), a damaging slasher (Bryant) and a deadly perimeter
marksman (Rice) to go with a rebounding phenom (Dennis Rodman) and
a host of other talented players. They should win the title.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury to New Jersey Nets, Sam Cassell and Chris
Gatling to Milwaukee, Terrell Brandon to Minnesota (plus other
minor player movement).
</P>
<P>
   -- Analysis: Marbury wanted out of Minnesota and to be home, or
close to it. He brings a liveliness to the nearly dead Nets, a star
quality. But Minnesota will not suffer as much as people think.
Brandon's actually more solid than Marbury, an All-Star who
requires less of the ball but can score when necessary and defend.
The Bucks wanted him to stay, but he wanted out. In Cassell,
Milwaukee gets a scorer at the point _ when he's healthy. Only
played four games this season.
</P>
<P>
   -- Winner: Nets, but not by much. Marbury's a star for the next
decade who should shine brightly near New York. But Brandon's
talented and committed and will make the drop-off of Marbury's
departure minimal.

 &HT;    NBA NOTES: Karl lets Sonics brass have it
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Milwaukee coach George Karl, formerly of the Seattle
SuperSonics, has his new team on the move but his old team on his
mind. Days before beating Seattle at home last week for the Bucks'
sixth consecutive win, Karl let the Sonics hierarchy have it.
</P>
<P>
   The targets were general manager Wally Walker and vice president
Billy McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   Karl: ``I believe the basketball people have to make the
basketball decisions, and I don't think Wally's a basketball guy. I
don't think Billy McKinney's a basketball guy. They're pseudo-gym
guys. They don't feel comfortable in the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``My animosity comes from the fact I want the truth to come out.
And the truth is, when you talk about the construction of the
tradition that we had in Seattle, Wally Walker's name should be
sixth or seventh on the rung of importance. Wally's not an
innovator. He's just there.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker responded: ``I think George is still mad about Virginia
beating North Carolina in 1973. That game was in a gym, I
believe.'' (Walker was a sophomore at Virginia and Karl a UNC
senior for that game.)
</P>
<P>
   Said McKinney: ``If you look at me, and you look at George, and
you look at Wally, it's evident who spends time in the gym and who
doesn't. If he spent more time in the gym working out his body
instead of being critical of people, maybe he could fit into these
Armani suits that I'm wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Proud alumnus
</P>
<P>
   Think NBA players aren't tuned in to the NCAA Tournament?
Consider this from Houston's Charles Barkley, a former Auburn star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to skip a game if (Auburn) goes to the Final Four,''
Barkley said. ``I'm going to the Final Four. I don't care if we're
playing the Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Rockets play at Golden State on the Final
Four date, and are off March 29, the night of the championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a special moment for Auburn, even more special if
someone like Charles showed up to show his support,'' said Auburn
coach Cliff Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   New route for Mailman
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone, who tried his hand as a sports talk-radio host in
the summer, said his next non-NBA gig will be hosting a TV show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling it, `Karl Malone's Great Outdoors,''' the host
said. ``It will be 26 episodes of 30-minute programs where I will
hunt big game, do some snowmobiling, bungee-jumping, whitewater
rafting, camping and fishing all around the world. Anywhere I want
to go, I'll go.''
</P>
<P>
   Can't wait.
</P>
<P>
   He said it
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a shooter (Glen Rice) and I got another thug power
forward (Dennis Rodman). Ain't no excuses now, for me or anybody
else in this locker room. We should be on our way,'' Lakers center
Shaquille O'Neal, on his team's championship hopes after the two
key acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs Up
</P>
<P>
   To the Portland Trail Blazers. Long thought of as a group of
enigmatic underachievers, the Blazers are rolling with the league's
best record under first-year coach Mike Dunleavy. Outstanding guard
Isaiah Rider has been suspended only once, which is good for him.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs Down
</P>
<P>
   To the New Jersey Nets. A team many felt would challenge for the
Atlantic Division title is second-worst in the league behind the
Los Angeles Clippers. Last year, New Jersey tried to dismiss New
York as also-rans. Turns out, it is the Nets who are fakers.

   On the threshold of what might have been total disaster, the
L.A. Clippers can smile a little. They met the one opponent they
had a real chance to beat over the next week and a half and they
finally won, beating Sacramento 106-92 Thursday night.

   The Clips beat the Kings three times last season. In fact, their
last victory before Thursday's came vs. the Kings, on the final day
of the '97-98 season. The Clips had lost 10 straight before that
game and 17 in a row to open this season, tying Miami's 11-year-old
record for early-season futility.Chris Ford

 &HT;    NFL NOTES: No. 1 pick might not be Couch
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Five weeks before the Cleveland Browns' triumvirate of
president Carmen Policy, GM Dwight Clark and coach Chris Palmer
exercises the first choice in the draft, the race for the No. 1
spot suddenly has become a three-man derby. Despite reports that
the Browns have settled on Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch as their
man, Oregon quarterback Akili Smith and Texas tailback Ricky
Williams now are neck-and-neck with him entering the home stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Couch likely could have secured the top spot at his on-campus
workout Thursday. But while his throwing session for NFL scouts was
solid, it was not spectacular. Some in attendance noted that Couch
may have tried too hard to dispel the lingering notion he lacks raw
arm strength, particularly on the deep ``out'' pattern. That
workout apparently was similar to a private audience Couch had
earlier in the week with Cincinnati coach Bruce Coslet and
offensive coordinator Ken Anderson. And it's no secret Palmer feels
Couch developed some mechanical flaws in coach Hal Mumme's
run-and-shoot offense.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Tom Condon has hired former NFL assistant Larry Kennan, a
longtime offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, to work with
Couch.
</P>
<P>
   The recent acquisition of Ty Detmer means Cleveland won't have
to force a rookie quarterback into the lineup and can provide a
young passer a season or two of apprenticeship. Given that
scenario, Couch remains the likely first choice, but it's no
slam-dunk. Before owner Al Lerner doles out the kind of contract
Peyton Manning signed last spring, Cleveland will want to examine
its options a little further.
</P>
<P>
   It's believed Clark's private preference is for Williams, who
would be running behind a line that features center Dave
Wohlabaugh, guard Jim Pyne and tackles Orlando Brown and Lomas
Brown and already might be better than half the blocking units in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons fodder
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are in an unusual situation with their salary cap
for 2000. Even with the multiyear signings of quarterback Danny
Kanell, cornerback Ronnie Bradford, safeties Gerald McBurrows and
Marty Carter and wideout Ronnie Harris, the team still has only 21
players under contract beyond 1999. That is one of the lowest
totals in the league and those players count an aggregate $30
million against the cap. For now, it means Atlanta has more than
$30 million to spend for 2000, more even than the Browns. That
total will be diminished as GM Harold Richardson attempts to
re-sign or extend potential free agents such as tailback Jamal
Anderson, center Robbie Tobeck, wide receiver Terance Mathis,
defensive ends Chuck Smith and Lester Archambeau and fullback Bob
Christian, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Tip sheet
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore personnel director Ozzie Newsome will meet today with
Detroit general manager Chuck Schmidt to try to consummate a trade
for quarterback Scott Mitchell. The Ravens have offered a
third-round pick in 2000 and the Lions want more than that. ...
Dallas owner Jerry Jones is seeking allies in his quest to dissolve
NFL Properties, the league's lucrative marketing branch. Jones
feels each team should market itself instead of sharing revenues.
... Clemson safety Antwan Edwards didn't endear himself to the
scouts Thursday when he declined to run the 40 at the school's Pro
Day workout. ... Jacksonville offensive tackle Tony Boselli is
chafing that the team has yet to extend his contract. Eleven
players on the Jaguars' roster will earn more than Boselli in 1999,
including six on offense. ... Seattle quietly worked out
quarterback Todd Marinovich, the former Raiders first-round bust,
last week but has decided not to pursue him. He hasn't played since
1992. ... Miami assistant head coach Dave Wannstedt will attend the
NFL meetings, further fueling speculation he will replace Jimmy
Johnson in 2000. ... Look for CBS to retain the league's radio
broadcast rights, fending off a bid by ESPN. ... Unless they trade
up from the sixth spot in the first round for Williams, the Rams
will take Miami tailback Edgerrin James. ... The era of the big
cornerback will take a de-evolutionary step in this year's draft.
Of the 23 corners at the combine, only Chris McAlister (Arizona),
Anthony Parker (Weber State) and Ken Wright (Northwestern
Louisiana) are more than 6 feet tall. Thirteen corners are 5 feet
10 or shorter. ... Two Ohio State stars, wideout David Boston and
linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, helped themselves considerably with
superb workouts Friday.
</P>
<P>
   No realignment?
</P>
<P>
   League vice president Joe Browne insisted last week there are
``some reservations'' about splitting the NFL into eight divisions
of four teams each once a 32nd franchise is added in 2002. But
influential Pittsburgh owner Dan Rooney will vote against expansion
Tuesday unless it is tied to realignment. Bengals owner Mike Brown
might join him. ... The Competition Committee has recommended that
the ball be placed at the 25-yard line instead of the 20 following
touchbacks on kickoffs. Only 80.3 percent of kickoffs were returned
in 1998, compared with 88.4 percent four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictions apply
</P>
<P>
   With the pool of unrestricted free agents all but dried up,
here's a list of 10 restricted free agents who might draw interest,
and the draft choice compensation each will cost a team that signs
them: Seattle DE Phillip Daniels (No. 4 pick), N.Y. Giants FS Percy
Ellsworth (none), Dallas WR Patrick Jeffers (No. 5), Kansas City DT
Tom Barndt (No. 6), Arizona OG Matt Joyce (none), Cincinnati FS
Greg Myers (No. 5), Minnesota TE Hunter Goodwin (No. 4), Tampa Bay
LB Jeff Gooch (none), Miami SS Shawn Wooden (No. 6), Detroit DE
Kerwin Waldroup (No. 5).
</P>
<P>
   Fly boys
</P>
<P>
   Once again, about one-third of the 318 prospects who attended
the combine workouts in Indianapolis declined to run the 40-yard
dash on the slow surface of the RCA Dome. Of those who did run,
here are the fastest times: CB Paul Miranda (Central Florida),
4.37; RB Cecil Collins (McNeese State), 4.41; WR Tai Streets
(Michigan), 4.42; CB Dee Moronkola (Washington State), 4.43; WR
Darran Hall (Colorado State), 4.44; CB Chris Cummings (LSU), 4.45.

 &HT;    Aides' benefits finally getting NFL's attention
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ With a schedule that includes the likely return of
instant replay, expansion to either Los Angeles or Houston for the
2002 season and the future of the Washington Redskins, owners will
deliberate over one of the more high-profile agendas in the last
several years when the NFL's annual meetings convene here Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Those significant issues notwithstanding, it may be a decision
by the league's Finance Committee _ one that doesn't even appear on
the official docket _ that could present the most far-reaching
ramifications for the near future. At some point in the next few
days, the committee will make a recommendation to owners on how the
league should deal with myriad work-related issues brought forward
by the NFL Coaches Association.
</P>
<P>
   League officials have promised longtime NFL assistant Larry
Kennan, the new full-time executive director of the NFLCA, a
``significant'' response to the request for enhanced benefits.
Anything less could result in the association moving toward
unionization, or even a work stoppage by assistant coaches in
training camp this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the NFL has been slow to act on these kinds of things,
but since last winter we have been told by prominent league
officials that we will get a significant response to the issues
we've raised,'' Kennan said late last week. ``We will be highly
disappointed if that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Kennan, 54, as the NFLCA's initial full-time
employee gives the association legitimacy. The NFL Players
Association has provided office space and counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Most owners recognize that their aides have grievances that
sorely need to be addressed. Among them are standardized health
insurance, life insurance, severance pay, full playoff shares and a
lower retirement age. The group is also concerned about diminished
job security and perceived age discrimination. Coaches have
suggested it would take no more than the salary of a player like
Deion Sanders to fund the upgraded benefits package.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money,'' Kennan said, ``should not be a factor in a league
with a television contract that's worth $18 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   While most owners seem more enlightened than in the past, those
in Dallas, Cincinnati and New Orleans have forbidden assistants to
join the NFLCA. The NFL appointed former New York Giants general
manager George Young to serve as liaison to the coaches and he has
apparently been a good sounding board.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in my mind, it shouldn't be a public debate,'' Bengals
owner Mike Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest issue of the week, the replay system recommended by
the Competition Committee, figures to generate plenty of debate
before a vote on Wednesday. Coming off a '98 season in which
officiating gaffes increased, replay proponents appear to have the
24 votes necessary to resurrect the tool.
</P>
<P>
   Owners are expected to vote for expansion on Tuesday, with Los
Angeles the favorite over Houston. In a move that could produce the
first $1 billion franchise fee in history, the league likely will
award a team to the city of Los Angeles rather than an owner and
then set up a bid process similar to the one used in Cleveland.

AFTER 16 YEARS, THE SACK EXCHANGE TO REUNITE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y., N.J.)   (jw) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They had a two-year run of great success and then it was
suddenly over. After registering 44.5 sacks in 1981 for the Jets,
the Sack Exchange came apart because of injuries and trades, and
its members began to go their separate ways 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But they are being reunited in that great sports phenomenon of
the modern era: the autograph session. As part of a Jets and Giants
Reunion Weekend, the Sack Exchange will appear next Sunday at the
Crowne Plaza in Secaucus, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   And just who were those guys?
</P>
<P>
   -- There was Abdul Salaam, who took the Arabic name meaning
Soldier of Peace after joining the Jets as Larry Faulk, and then
was traded following the 1983 season.
</P>
<P>
   -- There was Mark Gastineau, the emotional quarterback-sacker
who enjoyed exploring Indian burial grounds as much as chasing Dan
Marino. He still holds the National Football League record of 22
sacks in a season, set in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   -- The heart and soul of the group was Joe Klecko, the
self-described lunch-pail slob and the only player ever to go to
the Pro Bowl at three positions on the defensive line. He led the
league in sacks in 1981 with 21{, just ahead of Gastineau's 20, but
a torn knee ligament forced him to miss most of the 1982 season.
</P>
<P>
   -- And there was Marty Lyons, now a stockbroker, but then the
fellow who used to break windows with his fist before games to
energize his teammates. Once, he broke a table in half; another
time he hoisted a film projector and threatened to heave it against
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   In that 1981 season, when the Jets produced their first winning
season since the 1960s, they helped lead the way to a total of 66
sacks, then the second-most in NFL history and still the team
record. The assistant trainer, Pepper Burruss, used to chart the
sacks like stocks. One day a fan at Shea Stadium held up a sign
calling them the Sack Exchange, and the team's public relations
director, Frank Ramos, began officially referring to them that way
in his news releases. Soon they visited the New York Stock
Exchange, where they received a raucous ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, both Gastineau and Klecko have served time in jail _
Klecko for lying to a federal grand jury about helping a friend in
an insurance scam and Gastineau for hitting the woman who is now
his wife. Lyons went through a divorce, but rebounded with a
position at Paine Webber, and remains committed to charitable
causes. Salaam became a high school wrestling coach in Cincinnati.
In the early 1990s he also managed a singing group.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Salaam seemed to have disappeared. Lyons, Klecko
and Gastineau had made various appearances over the years, but when
the promoter of the reunion weekend tried to find Salaam, not even
the players association could help. Finally, somehow, the Secret
Service was asked to find him and they tracked him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why it was so difficult,'' Salaam said. ``I've
been here. But I'm such a quiet guy, even when I was traded away
back in 1983, no one even knew I had left New York.''
</P>
<P>
   He even had remained close to the public eye. ``I was managing
and promoting a top group, Sly Fox. We did Disneyland, Six Flags.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite going his own way, the special bond of the Sack Exchange
remained vibrant to Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make these guys believe in themselves,''
recalled Salaam, who joined the team in 1976. ``I was there first.
I wanted to build something. The Sack Exchange was the result of
that philosophy, so Mark could have that personality, a pure
performer, who was into himself. He wanted that record, which he
has. And Joe was analytical, figuring out where he could see his
opponent and make the best of it. Marty was a politician, getting
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   They loved who they were even though they didn't necessarily
love one another. Certainly, Klecko abhorred Gastineau. ``We're
from two different worlds,'' Klecko said now that the two have made
up. ``I'm a lunch-pail guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sack Exchange found love outside of football. Klecko is back
on his feet after disastrous financial setbacks. He and his wife,
Debbie, have produced a second group of three children many years
after they raised their first three.
</P>
<P>
   Gastineau is undergoing counseling and his wife, Patty, said:
``He is a changed man. He has insight into who he is and why he did
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Klecko still appreciates that, as a group, ``We were up there
with the Purple People Eaters, the Steel Curtain, the Fearsome
Foursome.''
</P>
<P>
   Salaam said: ``It's a great story. How we each have different
personalities but we each have one of the four elements that are in
creation _ what's the reason why we were able to establish
ourselves, and then to be named after the New York Stock
Exchange?''

17-0 START PROPELS CONNECTICUT TO SWEET SIXTEEN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ No shocks, no surprises, no problems. There was not
even a hint of them for Connecticut Saturday. The Huskies swaggered
onto the court fully focused on continuing their march toward a
national championship, and did it in an emphatic manner. A dazed
New Mexico team was finished before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the game with a 17-0 spurt and never letting the Lobos
wake up from the defensive sleeper hold they aggressively applied,
the Huskies rumbled to a 78-56 victory in the second round of the
West Regional of the NCAA tournament at McNichols Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case there were any skeptics in the arena who doubted
their supremacy after the first half, the Huskies also exploded for
the first 13 points of the second half. UConn made awesome look
ho-hum.
</P>
<P>
   In destroying the ninth-seeded Lobos (25-9), the top-seeded
Huskies (30-2) were precise, powerful and impenetrable. They shot
poorly, but they played stingy defense, they hustled as if they
were the underdogs and they suffocated Kenny Thomas, New Mexico's
finest player, holding him to one point _ 17.5 below his average.
Thomas looked lost, and looked as if he could not wait to get on an
airplane back to Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   UConn coach Jim Calhoun returned to the bench after missing
Thursday's 91-66 victory over Texas-San Antonio with an intestinal
virus, and he was his usual hyperactive self. Red-faced and
excitable, Calhoun was still barking instructions when the Huskies
led by 28 points.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The approach has worked wondrously for Calhoun, who
especially enjoyed Saturday's triumph because it was his 300th
career victory at Connecticut. Richard Hamilton and Khalid El-Amin
helped carry Calhoun to the plateau in his 420th game with 21
points each.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies advanced to the regional semifinals Thursday in
Phoenix and will play either Arkansas or Iowa, who met in
Saturday's second game. No matter who UConn meets next, the Huskies
will definitely be favored.
</P>
<P>
   They have displayed their depth and their desire in easily
winning their first two games of the tournament by an average of
23.5 points. Other than perhaps second-seeded Stanford, there are
no serious obstacles for UConn in pursuit of a spot in the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody is going to lose each and every night,'' said
Hamilton. ``We just hope it's not us. As long as we come out and
play hard and aggressive on defense and play as one, we don't think
that we're ever going to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking a little thinner in the face, Calhoun was back
patrolling the sideline and he shouted instructions, rarely sat
down and chewed gum as if he were being paid by the bite.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Calhoun said he felt some lingering effects of
an intestinal virus, but he was happy to be home after feeling
helpless while watching the last game on television.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun liked what he saw Saturday. Connecticut was assertive
while New Mexico was tentative, and the combination proved
delightful for the Huskies as they rolled to a 17-0 lead and held a
37-22 edge at halftime. El-Amin had 10 points while Hamilton,
despite shooting 2 of 9 from the floor, had nine points.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Thomas, New Mexico's talented center, touched the
ball, he stepped on the baseline. It was a terrible omen for the
Lobos, who struggled to handle the ball and even make shots against
UConn's feisty man-to man defense. New Mexico was a brutal 5 for 22
from the field, which disguised how abysmal UConn was at 12 for 32.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton and El-Amin drilled 3-pointers on UConn's first three
possessions to get the Huskies moving, and the avalanche continued
in a methodical manner.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies were not running by the Lobos for every basket, but
they did not have to because New Mexico's offense was absent. Kevin
Freeman had a nice tip-in and a strong dunk, El-Amin drove for a
layup and sank a 3-pointer and Edmund Saunders made two free throws
as the Huskies took their astounding 17-0 lead with 13 minutes 8
seconds left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was not astounding. At that point, the Lobos were 0 for
7 from the field with seven turnovers while UConn was a decent 6
for 14 with a lone turnover. The Lobos failed to get the ball
inside to Thomas, their meal ticket, who was being fronted by a
very physical Jake Voskuhl.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the 6-foot-8-inch Thomas touched the ball, Freeman
quickly slid across the paint to double-team him. It worked.
Thomas, who had 20 points in New Mexico's 61-59 first-round victory
over Missouri, was limited to one point in the half, missed all
four of his shots and did not play the last five and a half minutes
after getting his second foul.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With 12:48 remaining in the half, the Lobos finally ended the
shutout when Greg Davis nailed a free throw after being fouled by
Souleymane Wane. Of course, the fans at McNichols cheered the
long-awaited point in derisive fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Davis hit the second free throw to bring the Lobos within 15 at
17-2. After UConn's E.J. Harrison made a 3-pointer to lift the lead
to 18, New Mexico showed its most life. The Lobos scored nine
straight points, which included their first field goal, by Damion
Walker, 8:15 into the game, to trim the deficit to 20-11.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Lobos performed more competitively for the final
nine minutes of the half, the Huskies remained steady and never let
them get closer than nine points.
</P>
<P>
   The lead fluctuated between 10 and 17, which is what it was at
37-20 after Ricky Moore buried a 3-pointer with a few seconds left.
But John Robinson 2nd knifed between Moore and El-Amin to make an
8-foot jumper as the buzzer sounded, causing Calhoun to storm off
the bench and scream, ``How does that happen?'' to his two guards.
Yes, Calhoun was back. UConn never left. &QL;

RANCOR BETWEEN 2 SUFFOLK OFFICIALS GROWS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. _ The blood is bad between the Suffolk County
sheriff and the district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   So bad that in recent days the two of them, the county's top law
enforcement officers, have been making direct and oblique
references to Hitler, Hoffa and Oswald in talking about the other.
</P>
<P>
   So bad that the sheriff refers derisively to the district
attorney's son, himself a former deputy county attorney, as
``little Jimmy.''
</P>
<P>
   So bad that when Republican officials gather for publicity
photos, nobody wants the unsavory task of standing between the two
so they do not brush arms.
</P>
<P>
   The feud goes back at least as far as 1993, when District
Attorney James Catterson felt that Sheriff Patrick Mahoney had
upstaged him after Katie Beers, a 10-year-old who was kidnapped and
held for 16 days, was found alive.
</P>
<P>
   And the battle has become so well known that for years many on
the far edges of Long Island ignored the noise when the two
ambitious Republican officials clashed. But last month, even the
most hardened observers could not ignore the sheriff's cries of
``fascism,'' ``conspiracy'' and ``witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest eruption occurred a few weeks ago when Mahoney
announced that he was exploring the possibility of challenging
Catterson's longtime political ally, County Executive Robert
Gaffney, in the November election. Later that day Catterson
announced that a grand jury had indicted the Sheriff's Department's
chief mechanic on 51 counts, including charges of stealing cash and
surplus equipment and filing false overtime claims.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, Catterson convened a grand jury to investigate
what he called leads about corruption in the sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``a total conspiracy to ruin me by the district
attorney, and his ally, the county executive,'' Mahoney said.
``It's like living in Nazi Germany. Catterson should spend his time
trying murderers, rapists and burglars instead of his political
opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   But Catterson and Gaffney, also a Republican, rejected the
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the sheriff's continued references to
conspiracy,'' Catterson said. ``What's next? He's going to tell us
where Jimmy Hoffa is buried? Or who fired the second gun at
Kennedy? This investigation will continue until all leads are
followed up. Personally, I could care less about him one way or the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, including those of friends, they are cut from
the same cloth: two hard-driving, politically ambitious men proud
of their Irish roots.
</P>
<P>
   But Suffolk Republicans, who have long controlled this county of
1.4 million, are worried that voters, fed up with the feud and
other party problems, will decide to pull the Democratic lever in
the local elections this fall.
</P>

<P>
   For instance, John Powell, the former Suffolk County Republican
chairman and a close associate of Catterson's, was led from his
home in handcuffs in November, accused of taking bribes from a
carter for access to a public landfill and of conspiring to traffic
in stolen trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a total nuclear meltdown the likes of which you could
never have imagined at the Shoreham plant,'' said one top aide to a
Republican legislator who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``The problem is, it's really public. In the old days we had strong
leadership, and at least you could put them at the same table.''
</P>
<P>
   John Klein, the former Suffolk County executive and now a
prominent Republican lawyer based in Nassau County, was equally
hyperbolic. ``They're insane,'' he said. ``The theory is that there
is something in the ground water or in the overhead power lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Catterson's 10-year tenure as district attorney has been marked
by allegations that he has bullied public officials who crossed
him. But even his harshest critics concede the effectiveness of his
criminal prosecutions. Although he tends to become personally
involved in only the most public cases, his office boasts a 96
percent conviction rate, one of the highest in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In his investigation of the sheriff, Catterson said he was
looking into allegations that some of the 1,000 employees at the
county jail had been required to pay kickbacks to the sheriff in
return for promotions. Mahoney says the charges stem from a dispute
about overtime pay between the correction officers and the deputy
sheriffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tries to get my mechanic to flip on me for an offer of
immunity,'' Mahoney said. ``There's your smoking gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney called the charges absurd. And he pointed out that Judge
Gary Weber of State Supreme Court released the mechanic last month
on a very low bond, $5,000, despite the 51 counts against him.
</P>
<P>
   Catterson, 68, the son of a Suffolk County sheriff, cut his
political teeth in Nassau, where he was the county attorney and an
adviser to Joseph Margiotta, the legendary former Republican
chairman. Catterson went on to work as counsel for Perry Duryea,
the former Assembly speaker, and in private practice before he was
elected district attorney in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Catterson became the consummate political insider,
with an extensive network of allies that stretched across the
island, north to Albany and south into the Washington office of
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his Nassau connections, Catterson eventually became a
dominating figure in Suffolk County politics. He is described by
many as a combative, no-holds-barred politician.
</P>
<P>
   County Comptroller Joseph Caputo, who is also a Republican, said
Catterson threatened him with an investigation in 1995 in
connection with health contracts he oversaw. Caputo contends that
the district attorney's threats were in retaliation for an
investigation he led involving Catterson's personal use of a BMW
forfeited by a convicted drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I surprised about the investigation into the sheriff?''
Caputo said. ``No. Catterson thinks he runs this island, and if you
stand up to him, you pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Catterson was investigated by the governor's office in 1995 when
he was accused of abusing his prosecutorial powers, including
alleged threats of reprisals against the former commissioner of
health services, the chief medical examiner and the presiding
officer of the county legislature. The investigation found
insufficient evidence to warrant criminal charges or proceedings to
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   There is, perhaps, an especially cold place in Catterson's heart
for Mahoney, a former Suffolk County detective and county
legislator who was his running mate when they first sought their
current offices in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a year after they tangled over Katie Beers, Mahoney was
the first to make public a county car-leasing deal arranged by
Catterson's son, James III, who was then a deputy county attorney.
The deal was canceled when a legislative investigator determined
that it would cost the county $9 million less to buy the cars
outright.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Catterson's son had congressional aspirations, but
he ultimately became a state judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still thinks I ruined it for little Jimmy,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the sheriff sat in his Riverhead office, wondering if
he had made a big mistake in tangling again with Catterson. In
1997, in a letter to Gov. George Pataki, Mahoney accused Catterson
of intimidating a grand juror who had refused to indict a woman in
connection with the murder of her child. State investigators found
the charges baseless.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney, 56, said he would like to move beyond his current
office, which entails oversight of the county jails and serving
warrants. But he knows his chances of receiving the Republican
nomination for county executive are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke Reagan's rule: Never criticize a fellow Republican,''
Mahoney said. ``But hey, both my parents were Democrats.''

BODY OF STUDENT IS DISCOVERED IN SHAFTWAY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The body of a 19-year-old Baruch College student who
had been missing for more than four days was discovered Friday
night inside a trash-filled shaftway separating two of the school's
buildings, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards on the campus in Manhattan found the body of the
student, Yankum Huang, at 9:45 p.m., a little more than an hour
after the New York City Police Department held a news conference to
publicize her disappearance on Monday morning. Police said her
death was apparently a suicide but cautioned that a final
determination would be made by the city's medical examiner.
</P>
<P>
   A city official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
the security guards had checked the shaftway, between 111 E. 19th
St. and 106 E. 18th St., after a student at the school told them
she had seen something fall past a window earlier in the week. The
shaftway is not reachable or visible from the street.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Huang, a sophomore in the college's liberal arts program,
had last been seen by a friend around 10 a.m. on Monday. Police
said it was believed that she was on her way to Bensonhurst, where
she lived with her family. But she never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents searched for her until Thursday morning, before
phoning one of Ms. Huang's friends and having the friend call
police. They later indicated to the officers that Ms. Huang's home
life had been pleasant and that she did not have a boyfriend,
police said. Shy and studious, she was in the college's honors
program and not one to stay out late, they told police.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Cronholm, interim president of the 25,000 student college,
met with Ms. Huang's parents on Friday night after hearing of the
discovery. ``Everyone is distraught about what has happened, and it
has come as a total shock,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Huang's disappearance had been compared to that of another
honors student, Kristine Kupka, 28, who is still missing. Five
months pregnant, she vanished from her Brooklyn home in October.
Her family suspects that she may have been killed, but
investigators have made no arrests.

 &HT;    Winston driver wins Busch race again
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NASCAR's Catch-22 in the Busch series continued
Saturday with a Winston Cup driver winning the Busch race for the
third time in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Skinner, the Winston Cup points leader, took the lead with
20 laps to go in the No. 19 Chevrolet and held off pole-sitter Dave
Blaney to win the Yellow Freight 300 by 2.261 seconds at Atlanta
Motor Speedway. Defending Busch champion Dale Earnhardt Jr. was
third.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wreck-filled event, bringing out six cautions for 49
laps. The most spectacular accident, on lap 134, involved eight
cars and sent drivers Wayne Grubb and Dick Trickle to Atlanta
Medical Center for examination.
</P>
<P>
   But the topic of post-race conversation was once again the
presence of the more experienced Cup drivers in the Busch event,
which NASCAR has been trying to market as a league of its own.
However, seven Busch regulars finished in the top 10 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. characterized seeing one of his fellow Busch guys
failing to qualify in emotional terms: ''It's like a punch in the
gut to send a guy home who's fifth in points.''
</P>
<P>
   But he believes NASCAR ought to level the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody needs track time,'' Little E said. ''But I think the
first thing they should do is look at the teams. You don't need to
cater to an underfunded team. But maybe look at whether they're
running full schedules. Maybe limit the other teams that have Cup
drivers to five or eight races a year. Or leave five spots open for
the Cup guys to qualify for anywhere in the field and send the rest
of them home.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's two sides to the story. I don't think I'd be half the
race car driver I am today without what I learned following Mark
Martin and Jeff Burton and all those guys last year. And still,
today, I yearn to be with them and race with them. When you see
them up there dicing for the lead, you want to go up there and race
wth them and see how patient they are and learn gobs of stuff.
There's no limit to what these guys can teach you and they're very
eager to work with young drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   With two top fives in three Cup races, Skinners is off to his
best start. But Saturday's win was his first in nine career Busch
starts and his first top 10. His previous best finish was 24th.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't expect to win with this new team also sponsored by
Yellow Freight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were really junk in yesterday morning's practice. It was
really loose and scared me half to death.'' He said he got help
from his regular Cup team, the No. 31 Chevy, to get things right.
</P>
<P>
   He also sees both sides of the Busch controversy. ''Are you
hurting people's careers with the Winston Cup drivers getting in
there and winning some of the races? I don't really think so,''
Skinner said. ''I guess that's a decision NASCAR has to make and
I'll be behind them either way they go. If they don't want any more
Cup drivers in the Busch series that'll be fine with me. I've got a
son, 21 (Jamie), that's going to drive this Monte Carlo 3 or 4
races this year anyway and we'll just slide him in there full
time.''

 &HT;    Once again, rain in forecast at AMS
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In what is becoming an annual rite, NASCAR will battle
the weather in completing today's Cracker Barrel Old Country Store
500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasts were predicting showers and thunderstorms in
the area this morning, with high temperatures expected to reach
only the upper 40s to low 50s. The rain was expected to end by
midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather is what we always seem to have here _ cloudy, damp
and cold,'' driver Jeff Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Inclement weather during race week in Atlanta has become an all
too familiar sight for Bruton Smith, chairman of Speedway
Motorsports, which owns AMS.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he's lobbying NASCAR president Bill France Jr. and
chief operating officer Mike Helton to get Atlanta's spring Winston
Cup race moved to later in the season. The second date at AMS, the
NAPA 500 on Nov. 21, is the Cup season finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back in history, March has always been a bad date
for Atlanta,'' Smith said. ``We need to do something. Maybe next
year we can do a little shuffling or trading. Darlington always has
good weather this time of year. Maybe it would be beneficial for
them to switch, but it would be NASCAR's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   It's apparent that NASCAR must do something. Last year's spring
race, the Primestar 500, was postponed one day after rain washed
away any hopes of racing on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In November, drivers and fans endured rain delays of 6 hours, 39
minutes. When the race finally resumed, there were still 19 laps
remaining at 11 p.m in the 221-lap, rain-shortened event.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales for today's event were slow after
less-than-favorable weather forecasts earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we get it in everybody will be happy,'' said Bobby
Labonte, who will start on the pole in his No. 18 Pontiac. ``The
worst thing is to sit around all day watching and then have to come
back the next day. With the lights, we have some options here.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who has won three of the last five races at AMS, and
Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Tony Stewart will start in the first two
rows, with Mike Skinner starting outside Labonte on Row 1. Ford
drivers Dale Jarrett and Jeremy Mayfield will start fourth and
fifth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time defending Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon, who got his
record-tying 13th victory of last season at AMS, will start eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good memories from the last time we were here, that's
for sure,'' Gordon said. ``It's going real well for us, like the
last time we were here. The car feels very similar and the track
feels very similar. I'm sure some other guys have gotten better,
but as far as the weather, we can't control that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since winning the season-opening Daytona 500 on Feb. 14, Gordon
hasn't found victory lane. Jack Roush Racing teammates Mark Martin
and Jeff Burton have taken the last two wins at Rockingham and Las
Vegas. But Burton needed a provisional to make the field for
today's race and will start 37th.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the results of the last two races, I'd say
(there's some parity in the sport),'' Gordon said. ``I was a little
nervous about halfway through Las Vegas last weekend because I was
the first Chevy and I was running 10th. I personally think the
Pontiacs are the best cars right now. The Fords are really good,
and the Chevys seem to be pretty close.''

BRONX IS JOINING FUROR OVER ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first St. Patrick's Day parade in the Bronx in 70
years has, in the last few days, become embroiled in the same
political turmoil over gay marchers that has troubled the St.
Patrick's Day parade in Manhattan since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, and other elected
officials said Friday that they would not march in Sunday's parade
because organizers had decided to exclude a gay and lesbian Irish
organization, the Lavender and Green Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parades should be bringing people together, not tearing them
apart,'' Ferrer said. ``I was under the original impression that
this was an event intended to be open to all comers.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, organizers from the Throgs Neck Benevolent
Association invited the gay organization to march under its own
banner. Advertisements for the parade also said that all groups
were welcome.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, alliance officials said, parade organizers told
them that the group would not be welcome after Irish church and
school groups threatened to withdraw in protest over the inclusion
of gay marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy McNulty, a co-chairman of the Lavender and Green Alliance,
said the decision was ``completely disheartening after the welcome
that was extended to us.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Here it is, in 1999. We've finally seen that there
are people willing to include us. But under pressure, bigotry has
ruled once again.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ferrer said the parade was intended to be a ``great
celebration,'' instead it is now replicating an annual controversy
over the parade up Fifth Avenue and exposing strains within the
Irish community.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, gay organizations have been prohibited from marching
in the Manhattan parade under their own banners. Despite legal
battles and protests, the Ancient Order of the Hibernians, which
organizes the parade, has refused to modify its stand.
</P>
<P>
   At the St. Patrick's Day Parade in 1993, Cardinal John O'Connor
defended the decision to exclude gay groups, declaring that
political correctness is not worth ``one comma in the Apostles'
Creed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the years, conflict over the right to march has practically
become a mini-tradition within the larger tradition of the Irish
parade. Gay groups have also been banned from marching in the St.
Patrick's Day Parade in Brooklyn. But the Bronx parade promised to
be an exception, and to members of the Lavender and Green Alliance
that signaled a new era.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty said that he was ecstatic on March 4 when the alliance
received an invitation from a parade organizer, Patrick Devine.
``It was the first parade in the city to welcome us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, at a party to celebrate the group's fifth
anniversary, the group announced that it would march. The
celebration itself was another milestone, because a Roman Catholic
church, St. Paul the Apostle on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan, let the
group hold its party there.
</P>
<P>
   A March 7 press release from the alliance hailed its invitation
to march. As a result, two Irish newspapers ran articles about the
group being welcomed, and pressure started to build from
organizations like the Ancient Order of the Hibernians and the
Knights of Columbus, McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Devine called the alliance and withdrew the
invitation. ``He told us that he's getting pressure, that churches
would pull out and schools would pull out, and that they were going
to have to withdraw the welcome,'' McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
   Devine did not return two phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx parade is scheduled to begin Sunday at noon on the
corner of East Tremont and Lafayette avenues in the Throgs Neck
section of the Bronx. Gay organizations including the alliance, the
Gay and Lesbian Independent Democrats, and Dignity, a Catholic
group, plan to protest at the march, and are to be joined by City
Councilwoman Christine Quinn and state Senator Thomas K. Duane.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Guiliani will not attend the Bronx parade because
of scheduling conflicts, a spokeswoman said, but will attend the
Manhattan parade on Wednesday.

SEA SCOUTS TRY FOR ANOTHER SAILING SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: R.I., Conn.)   (jw) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is with understandable optimism that a bunch of teen-age
sailors are preparing these cold, wintry days for Block Island Race
Week in June. The team of Sea Scouts slipped into the event through
the back door two years ago, and an unexpected victory made them
defending champions in the biennial rendition of the regatta.
</P>
<P>
   The teens shocked a fleet of adult crew members in 1997 by
winning the Cruising Canvas Class. The Storm Trysail Club and
Yachting Magazine stage the Block Island regatta on alternate years
and the race series is traditionally well attended and competitive.
No one expects less of the event this year, scheduled for June
20-25 on Rhode Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost on the teen-agers' minds these days is making a new
high-tech Kevlar sail, which they plan to build this month at a
loft in Norwalk, Conn., where most of them live and the Sea Scout
group, Ship 6, is based.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of diligence allows the teens to be taken seriously in
big-boat sailing. Teen-agers in yachting usually compete in small
dinghies, and they rarely move beyond the junior-race level except
as a crew member here and there. Their appearance at Block Island
was the first for a crew of teens.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Austin, the Sea Scouts' team leader and boat skipper, said
that the victory two years ago might have been a surprise to
everyone else, but not to the seven scouts racing. ``It was
basically a boatload of children on a race horse,'' Austin said.
``People said, `Oh, you're here to watch.' And we said, `No, we're
here to race.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Their 40-foot race boat, known in its former racing circles as
Celebration, was donated to the group six years ago. The sailboat
was not in the best of shape when it arrived. But Celebration had a
respected past that included victories in the Southern Ocean Racing
Conference, an annual grand prix regatta off Florida. And for the
Sea Scouts, the yacht's tender condition upon arrival became a
rallying point, an inspiration for their do-it-yourself eagerness.
</P>
<P>
   The Hathaway, Reiser &AMP; Raymond sail loft in Norwalk has already
helped the Sea Scouts build a 580-square-foot Dacron mainsail,
which will be used for many of the group's 60 or more day sails,
races and overnight trips that the Ship No. 6 Sea Scouts take each
summer. The mainsail would have cost them about $4,200 to buy, but
donations in time and materials from the Hathaway loft meant that
the only cost to them was time _ after school and on Saturdays this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the teens received free sail cloth from Dimension
Polyant Sailcloth, a marine company in Putnam, Conn., and use of a
laser-cutting machine from Banks Sails in Norwalk.
</P>
<P>
   The mainsail made of Kevlar, a material that allows a more
streamlined design, will be used for racing at Block Island.
Prospects for a faster sail have the scouts more enthused than
ever. ``We'll be doing a lot more work on that sail,'' said David
Flewellyn, a 16-year-old Sea Scout who raced at Block Island.
``It's mostly going to be glued together with industrial glue, so
we can do 80 percent of the work. With the Dacron sail, we had to
let the loft seamstresses do all the sewing.'' If they had to buy
the sail retail, it would cost about $6,500.
</P>
<P>
   Flewellyn said he was confident that his team could win again at
Block Island. But it will be hard to duplicate the excitement of
coming out of nowhere two years ago. ``I was ecstatic,'' he said
about that victory. ``I couldn't believe it. Dennis Conner was
right there as they announced our name. All week people had been
rooting for us because we were the underdog. But we knew we could
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, others also think they can do it again. ``They're
very focused and well trained, '' said Rich du Moulin, an America's
Cup crew member in the 1960s and 1970s who has donated used
headsails from his Express 37 grand prix boat to the Sea Scouts.
``My feeling is that they could win in that class again.''
</P>
<P>
   MAKING WAVES
</P>
<P>
   With five of the nine sailboats in the Around Alone
single-handed fleet safely ashore last week in Punta del Este,
Uruguay, the fourth port of call, race organizers confirmed the
overall standings in the two race classes. In first place among the
60-foot Class I sailboats is Giovanni Soldini, the Italian solo
racer who rescued Isabelle Autissier from her capsized boat last
month in the South Pacific Ocean. By heeding Autissier's distress
call, Soldini was awarded a 24-hour reduction in elapsed time for
Leg 3. ... Leading Class II, for boats up to 50 feet, is
Jean-Pierre Mouligne, a Frenchman who lives in Newport, R.I. As
skipper of the 50-foot yacht, Cray Valley, Mouligne has finished
first in all three legs so far of the 27,000-mile competition . &QL;

REAL ESTATE: HOME SWEET HOTEL, WITH EXTENDED RATES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Wash., Calif.)   By ALAN S. OSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home for Jonathan Worswick is San Diego. But since last July he
has been living in Manhattan, first in one hotel and now in another
_ Plaza 50.
</P>
<P>
   His employer, Advanced Information Resources, a San Diego-based
software company, sent him here with a few colleagues to tend to
the computer needs of a handful of commercial banks. He came
expecting to be on the job for three months, but the stay has been
extended twice, and now is expected to run at least until July.
</P>
<P>
   The assignment made the 35-year-old Worswick a candidate for
residence in what the lodging industry has come to label an
``extended-stay hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   He is in a building that has 74 guest rooms and operates as a
transient hotel. But it also has 132 suites with kitchens, and it
offers discounts for stays up to 30 days. A total of 22 percent of
its occupancy consists of guests staying two weeks or longer, the
management says.
</P>
<P>
   So Plaza 50 is in a sense a hybrid, a transient hotel filled
with suites appropriate for longer-term occupancy, and one among
many of the recent variants in forms of lodging operations that are
cropping up in Manhattan. The hybrid is presenting challenges for
New York City zoning law, especially in residential condominiums,
where it is illegal to rent out rooms on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   Most suite hotels or pure extended-stay hotels are run by
national chains in suburban centers of corporate activity, where
they are frequently hosts to visiting business people and trainees.
More of these hotel products are en route to Manhattan, via such
chains as Doubletree Guest Suites, Embassy Suites and perhaps
Homewood Suites, Homestead Village and Candlewood. Nationally, the
length of stay in an extended-stay hotel typically ranges from two
weeks to three months; suite hotels have a shorter-term occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   There already has been a growth in Manhattan of longer-term
occupancy hotels that provide furnished suites and hotel and maid
services, but they do not necessarily consider themselves
extended-stay hotels. If the building is in a zone that bars
transient occupancy, the management may be at pains to avoid the
term hotel entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-suite Envoy Club, which occupies the first five floors of
a new rental building, is an example. It requires a minimum stay of
30 days, and it may give a lease for as long as one year. Prices
for a 30-day stay in a one-bedroom suite start at $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips Club, with 200 suites is now being built by
Millennium Partners, and 96 suites are in operation within the
company's Grand Millennium residential condominium. The Phillips
Club describes itself as an extended-stay hotel, but nevertheless
has a one-month minimum stay, with prices for a one-bedroom suite
starting at $6,600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But nomenclature differs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our average length of stay is five months though our minimum
is one month,'' said Claes Loven, who runs the 84-unit Sutton
Hotel, though he prefers to call it merely the Sutton. ``We are not
an extended-stay hotel.'' Monthly rates for one-bedroom suites
range from $6,000 to $9,000. Another example is the 108-suite
Marmora-Manhattan Hotel, with one-bedroom monthly rates of $4,500
to $7,200.
</P>
<P>
   Some zoning specialists believe that the city's zoning code is
poorly designed to deal with the phenomenon of temporary occupancy
in service-enhanced housing. In the zoning code a ``hotel'' is by
definition for transients only, meaning that customers cannot book
for more than 30 days. Hotels are allowed in commercial zones only.
An apartment hotel, a category allowed in residential zones, must
offer leases of 30 days or more. There is no other category.
</P>
<P>
   What happens in a time-share situation, when a unit is purchased
in a condominium and then leased out regularly for brief periods of
time?'' asked Michael Parley, the principal in Development
Consulting Services, which provides zoning consulting services to
the real estate industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the extended-stay operators come to New York and we tell
them they have to file for a building permit either as a
residential building or a transient hotel, they are amazed,''
Parley said. ``It often means they can't function in a location
where they believe their operation would be totally appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The zoning code should be updated, Parley said, to take the
extended-stay phenomenon into account. This would benefit
legitimate extended-stay operators if it allowed them to operate in
any of the residential districts where apartment hotels are already
allowed. It could also enable condominium developers to offer
apartments that may legally be used for extended stays or transient
occupancy as well as permanent occupancy. Currently, it is not
unusual for individual owners in residential condominiums to rent
out their apartments through brokers on a daily basis, although
this violates zoning law when the building has a residential
certificate of occupancy. ``In some locations the hybrid building
should be legal,'' Parley said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the city's foremost developer of a hybrid hotel is the
locally based, family-run Manhattan East Suite Hotels chain, the
owner of Plaza 50 and nine other Manhattan hotels. Its latest
project is the Benjamin, a $40 million reconstruction of the former
Beverly Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Still under construction, the Benjamin will open next month with
209 rooms, including 97 one-bedroom suites, and function as a
transient hotel with discount rates for extended stays. Nightly
rates will start at $320 for a room and $420 for a standard
one-bedroom suite, with a standard discount of 15 percent for seven
days and 20 percent for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   When Benjamin J. Denihan Sr. started developing all-suite hotels
in the early 60s, he called them apartment hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The first project was the 134-unit Lyden Gardens, where he had
long run a high-end laundry and dry-cleaning establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In its expansion through acquisitions over the years the chain
has converted many rooms into suites, with full kitchens, to meet
the demand for longer stays. For example, the company bought the
400-room Shelburne Hotel in 1967 and converted it into 263 suites
with kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 25 percent of Manhattan East Suite's overall
occupancy is for a week or longer, said Daniel J. Denihan and his
sister, Brooke Denihan Barrett, two of the owning partners, in an
interview. Eighty percent of the business is corporate.
</P>
<P>
   The company still does its own laundry. At its headquarters in a
converted loft it handles 4.5 million pounds of laundry a year on
one shift, servicing all 2,000 of its rooms or suites. ``After we
get to 5.5 million pounds we'll have to go to two shifts,'' said
Denihan, whose partners include two brothers, his sister, a nephew
and one nonfamily associate.
</P>
<P>
   While the Manhattan East Suite Hotel chain has evolved from an
apartment-hotel operation into a suite-hotel operator with
substantial transient occupancy, the national chains accustomed to
serving corporate clients in suburban office parks are developing
long-term-stay operations in the city. The operators say they find
that the average length of an extended stay in a ``destination''
city is longer than it is in a suburban office park.
</P>
<P>
   Stevan D. Porter, executive vice president for operations of
Promus Hotel Corp., the Memphis-based owner-operator and franchiser
of more than 1,300 hotels with 192,000 rooms, said that the
Doubletree hotel in Times Square and the Embassy Suites hotel under
construction in Battery Park City would be traditional transient
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   But if Promus develops one of its Homewood Suites projects in
the city it will be a ``pure extended-stay hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Homewood Suites buildings have one-and two-bedroom suites
with a sizable entertainment area and a full eat-in kitchen. ``The
expectation is that 55 percent of the guests will stay 15 nights or
longer, but it's not a residential hotel,'' Porter said. ``We have
it in downtown Chicago and we're working on it in Washington,
D.C.''

REAL ESTATE: CO-OPS STRIKE UNOFFICIAL TRUCE WITH IRS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For nearly 20 years, lawyers and accountants for
residential co-ops across the country have been engaged in a
running battle with the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   It revolves around an IRS assertion that income received by a
co-op corporation from sources other than tenant shareholders
cannot be offset by the expenses of running the co-op _ an
interpretation of the Tax Code that can cost co-ops considerable
amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   Co-op lawyers and accountants have consistently argued that the
IRS interpretation of the law is wrong _ a contention supported by
a 1996 Federal Tax Court ruling involving a co-op at 665 Thwaites
Place in the Bronx. Notwithstanding that ruling, however, the
service continued to audit co-ops that did not report the income in
question as taxable _ apparently willing to litigate the issue
again.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the apparent intractability of the IRS, co-op
organizations across the country and their professionals formed a
task force to initiate a federal lawsuit that would put the matter
to rest once and for all. Last April, Joel Miller, a Queens tax
lawyer hired for the job, sued the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The service answered the lawsuit, reiterated its position and
continued collecting taxes on all income derived from sources other
than shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Then the IRS blinked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The position of the government has changed,'' said Shelly
Bienenstock, a Manhattan-based IRS Appeals Officer, speaking to a
group of co-op lawyers and accountants at a meeting convened by the
Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums and the
Federation of New York Housing Cooperatives on Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who were at the meeting, which was recorded on
audiotape, say that Bienenstock's appearance was unusual, because
when the IRS has something official to say, it usually does so in
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Bienenstock explained, however, that while the position of the
government had indeed changed, it had not changed officially.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of today, Revenue Ruling 90-36 is still in effect,''
Bienenstock said, referring to the official written pronouncement
on the subject issued by the IRS in 1990. ``But I can tell you that
it's going to be applied rarely, if at all.''
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that the IRS is saying, `We're not going to give you
anything in writing, but we're probably going to leave you alone,'
'' said Miller, the lawyer for the task force. And, he added, that
can be very important indeed to many co-ops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the great majority of co-ops will derive some
benefit from this,'' Miller said. ``And there are some that will
save tens of thousands of dollars.'' That benefit, he said, will
largely result from co-ops being able to reduce or eliminate taxes
on income from reserve funds by using co-op expenses and perhaps
even depreciation to offset such income.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Siegler, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, explained that the
controversy originated as the result of a determination by the IRS
that for tax purposes, residential co-ops more closely resembled a
``membership organization'' than a true cooperative, such as the
early farm cooperatives. The distinction was critical, he said,
because while residential co-ops are governed by what is known as
Subchapter T of the tax code, membership organizations are governed
by what is called Section 277.
</P>
<P>
   The original intent behind Section 277, Siegler explained, was
to prevent membership organizations and social clubs that are not
tax exempt from nevertheless escaping taxes on business or
investment income by using such income to provide services to their
members and then deducting the expense from the income.
</P>
<P>
   Under Section 277, he said, membership organizations may deduct
expenses associated with providing services to members only from
income derived from the members themselves. Income from outside
sources may not be offset by expenses incurred in providing
services to members.
</P>
<P>
   When the IRS decided that co-ops fall under Section 277, Siegler
said, that meant that income from outside sources _ including
interest income on the co-op's reserve fund _ could not be offset
by the expenses associated with running the co-op.
</P>
<P>
   ``This resulted in co-ops with otherwise deductible expenses
equal to or in excess of their gross income being liable for income
tax,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Siegler said, the IRS adopted Revenue Ruling 90-36, the
one referred to by Bienenstock, which officially declared that
residential co-ops were subject to Section 277. However, he said,
many accountants took the position that unless the co-op had been
audited in the past, the co-op was not subject to tax liability
under Section 277. That, however, resulted in hitting some co-ops
with tax bills that could add up to tens of thousands of dollars
when the IRS conducted an audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a number of co-ops that have been audited by the
IRS,'' said Dennis Greenstein, a Manhattan co-op lawyer. ``They
were absolutely shocked when they found out they owed taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenstein said that the change in the IRS position is
significant for a large number of co-ops in New York. ``This is a
major issue because until now, any building that had any kind of
investment income could be affected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the IRS has decided that it will no longer be likely to
tax co-ops under Section 277, that means that it will be taxing
them under Subchapter T.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Kleiman, a Manhattan accountant, said that co-ops faced a
whole new set of challenges and uncertainties. Under Subchapter T,
Kleiman said, co-op income is divided into two categories _
``patronage-sourced'' and ``nonpatronage-sourced.'' ``Income is
considered patronage-sourced if it is derived from an activity that
is closely linked with the main cooperative effort,'' he said,
adding that such income must also be ``directly related to, and
inseparable from, the co-ops' principal business activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Income is considered non-patronage-sourced, Kleiman said, if it
results from an activity that merely enhances the co-op's
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Under Subchapter T, he said, nonpatronage-sourced income is
taxed in much the same way that nonmembership income is taxed under
Section 277. While that may seem to imply that co-ops are no better
off under Subchapter T, that is not necessarily the case.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, while income from the investment of the
co-op's reserve fund would be exposed to tax under Section 277, it
would likely be considered patronage-sourced income under
Subchapter T.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that while he believed there was little chance that
the IRS would revert to its former position on Section 277, the
task force stood ready to file a new lawsuit if necessary.

EDITORIAL: TAX BREAKS FOR LOW-INCOME WORKERS _ AN EXCELLENT IDEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, March 14:
</P>
<P>
   It is not often that the major social welfare agencies in New
York line up to support a proposal advanced by Joseph Bruno, the
upstate Republican who is majority leader of the state Senate. It
happened last week when Bruno, previously an advocate of cutbacks
in welfare and health care for the poor, proposed a tax break for
low-income workers. It would be paid for by savings that have
resulted from the drop in welfare rolls. The idea makes particular
sense because it would reward, among others, precisely those people
who managed to get low-paying jobs after being on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno's proposal would let working people who earn less than
$30,000 keep more of their earnings. Even more attractive, it would
give a cash refund to working families making less than $14,000,
who pay no income tax at all. This payment, known as the
earned-income tax credit, was a centerpiece of President Clinton's
tax initiative of 1993. It has turned out to be one of the most
successful anti-poverty programs of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The particular attraction of the credit, which would cost $160
million a year to finance, is that much of it would be paid for
with federal funds. Under the welfare reform act, Congress
converted its matching payments to the state into a block grant
that has kept level since 1997. The decline in welfare rolls means
that $500 million in federal matching funds have not been spent, a
sum expected to rise to $1.4 billion in a year. Under Federal
rules, this money can be spent only to help the poor through
day-care, drug-assistance or other programs designed to help them
hold down jobs. In suggesting that some of the money go for a tax
credit to supplement the income of the working poor, Bruno is
adopting an approach already being pursued by about a dozen states.
</P>
<P>
   New York has been slow to spend all the surplus money available
under welfare reform, in part because of a desire to save some in
case there is a recession and the welfare rolls expand again. But
using as much money as possible for a tax credit will create a
bigger incentive for people to get off the rolls. That is
important, because with each passing year federal law requires
larger percentages of people on welfare to find work.

REAL ESTATE: VERMONT'S STRONG ECONOMY PUSHES HOUSING DEVELOPMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Wis., Mass.)   By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLISTON, Vt. _ Economic growth is stoking new residential
construction here in the northwestern part of the state, as well as
in Vermont's southeast. The activity in both regions is giving the
state a handful of large new subdivisions with long-term completion
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The homes include traditional detached houses on half-acre lots
as well as clustered smaller, but nevertheless detached, houses
that the developer calls carriage homes. In these the buyer owns
the house and the ground on which it is built, but the grounds
around them are owned and maintained by a homeowners' association.
All the houses have two-car garages.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the master plans for these large developments
generally call for house lots of a half acre or less with a
significant percentage of the land kept as natural open space.
</P>
<P>
   The profile of the buyers is also changing, builders say. The
strong economy is attracting people from other parts of the country
who are moving here to work. Changing demographics have led
developers to cater to more older clients who are attracted to
small, easy-to-care-for properties. On the other side of the market
equation, more large tracts of land are becoming available as the
owners of unprofitable farms age.
</P>
<P>
   While new home prices in these subdivisions can be 50 percent
greater than homes that the same developers built in the early
1990s, houses are selling as fast as they can be constructed, the
builders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen a market this strong in 10 years,'' said
Robert A. Snyder, president of the Snyder Cos., which is developing
Brennan Woods, a 174-lot subdivision on 183 acres purchased from a
dairy farmer eager to retire.
</P>
<P>
   What propels home buyers is not the region's 1.9 percent
unemployment rate, added Snyder, who is putting up 22 carriage
homes and 152 larger detached houses at Brennan Woods. ``It's job
creation,'' he said. ``As more people get good jobs or advance,
they can buy starter homes so other buyers can move up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Snyder Cos. started construction on Brennan Woods four
months ago in this town once dominated by dairy farms. So far, the
developer has sold 17 homes, priced from $185,000 to $196,000 for
carriage houses with 1,500 to 1,700 square feet of space on one or
two levels, to $220,000 to $250,000 for the larger homes. These
range from 1,900 to 3,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to keep a pace of about 25 sales a year for
the next six or seven years, Snyder said. Many of his buyers are
people who are trading up or relocating. For example, in January
Suzanne and Joseph Bourgeois moved here with their two small
children from LaCrosse, Wis. Bourgeois was promoted and moved to
headquarters by his employer, the Blodgett Corp., a maker of ovens
based in Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started looking in September but nothing was available,''
said Ms. Bourgeois, 34, who with her 37-year-old husband purchased
a $254,000 house in Brennan Woods. ``We fell in love with Williston
because it's a rural setting with friendly people but close to
work, shopping and the highway. We saw some other Snyder homes we
liked. So we decided to build.''
</P>
<P>
   The Snyder company's experience here in Chittenden County is
being repeated in southeastern Vermont's Windsor County, which
extends from central Vermont east to the New Hampshire border and
south to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Windsor County town of Hartford, said Hunter F.
Rieseberg, the town manager, ``for businesses, the main restraint
on growth is the lack of housing at all price levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Both counties are close to centers of economic growth. Here in
Chittenden County, the economic engine is the metropolitan
Burlington region. In Windsor, it is just over the state line in
Hanover, N.H., the home of Dartmouth College and the Mary Hitchcock
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   For Vermont, the accelerated economic activity has generated
about 31,000 new jobs since 1992, increasing the supply of nonfarm
jobs to 280,000. As a result, unemployment has fallen to 3.4
percent statewide, from 6.7 percent in 1992, and down to 1.9
percent in Chittenden County, said Jeffrey G. Carr, vice president
of Economic &AMP; Policy Resources, a consulting firm in Williston.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s, real estate development was pushing growth,''
Carr said. ``Now, the situation is reversed. Strong economic
fundamentals are driving the demand for housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year 1,971 permits were issued for new home construction
throughout Vermont, a 19.5 percent rise from a year earlier. Even
more houses would have been built had there not been a labor
shortage, Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   The sales market has benefited from the fact that there has been
so little new residential construction. In the '90s most new
development projects have been commercial or industrial, said
Charles LaRosa, president of the Vermont Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Now, developers are seizing the moment. In Hartford, for
example, the Simpson Development Corp. recently completed a 152-lot
subdivision on 126 acres and a 72-lot project on 33 acres. The
company is now seeking permits to build an 85-lot project on 63
acres just over the state line in Lebanon, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   They are all cluster developments with single-family detached
houses of 1,400 to 2,000 square feet, with prices starting at
$170,000. The target market is retirees and people working for
Dartmouth or the Mary Hitchcock Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Simpson built town-house condominium projects
with units of about 1,100 square feet priced at $100,000, many of
which were sold to investors, said Dennis Marquis, the company's
director of development. Now, the company presells all homes at
higher prices and builds fewer units per project. ``We have fewer
construction dollars at risk,'' he explained. ``And our current
buyers are older and more affluent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Snyder Companies is also welcoming older buyers at Brennan
Woods. The project, which will cost about $30 million to build,
will leave 53 percent of the site as open space, compared to 30
percent at Southridge, the last subdivision the company built here.
At Southridge, detached home prices started at $170,000. At Brennan
Woods, they start at $220,000 and offer the carriage houses that
attracted Shirley and Leonard Mercia who are 72 and 76,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the views of the Adirondacks on one side and Lake
Champlain on the other,'' said Mrs. Mercia, a retired secretary.
``We wanted the country setting and the convenience of being within

NCAA NEEDS NATIONAL STANDARDS
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter will
hear arguments in Philadelphia on a ruling he made last week that
stops the NCAA from using minimum standardized-test scores in
freshman eligibility requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping Judge Buckwalter changes his mind about
Proposition 16.
</P>
<P>
   To keep colleges and universities from taking the ``student,''
out of student-athlete, it is critical a national standard remain
in place. Since 1986, Proposition 16 has been that standard for
student-athletes, requiring a high school senior to have at least
an 820 on the SAT and a 2.5 grade-point-average in 13 ``core
classes'' in order to be declared eligible to play sports in
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, the standardized-test scores and the core
GPA requirements have been a pretty good predictor of academic
success,'' said Pete Carlon, athletic director at the University of
Texas at Arlington. ``I'm afraid without (Prop 16), you'd have a
lot of kids who'd get exploited for one or two years.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you'd have a lot of youths with absolutely no
chance of succeeding in college being recruited by coaches who are
more concerned about victories than about education.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many coaches, and Judge Buckwalter, disagree with the
importance of Prop 16, and specifically the weight it places on
standardized tests. They say that the ACT and SAT are culturally
biased against inner-city kids and students from poor neighborhoods
_ you know, black kids. In fact, in his 54-page ruling, Buckwalter
wrote that, ``African-American and low-income student-athletes have
been disproportionately impacted,'' by Proposition 16.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, numbers don't lie. So the tests should be tweaked to
make sure that people with brown skin like me have as much a chance
at passing the tests as those with pale skin.
</P>
<P>
   That tweaking, in fact, has been going on for the past decade or
so, said Bill Reeves, the UTA associate athletic director who is on
the NCAA's initial eligibility waiver committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of intelligent people who have worked for 10
years to remove the bias from the SAT,'' Reeves said. ``If there is
something better out there, then I don't know what it is. Before we
say, `there is a better way,' we better name it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said student-athletes have not been declared ineligible
at UTA any more with Prop 16 than before the guideline was put in
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have fewer minorities now than before,'' Reeves said.
``We have better ones. We have minorities (athletes) who are
successful now. A big reason for that, I think, is (Prop 16). Each
year, the quality of our student has improved, but the percentage
of minorities (in sports) has not gone down.''
</P>
<P>
   And isn't that what college is all about? Higher learning.
</P>
<P>
   (Quick aside. A few years ago, the SAT people changed the
scoring on its exam. The required minimum of 820 is actually the
same 700 that had to be scored in the 1980s. Seems like a fairly
attainable score to achieve. A perfect score on the SAT is 1,600,
which means you just have to get a little more than half the
questions right to qualify. Too bad life isn't always that easy.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, though, after you tweak the SAT, and after you get more
youths passing it, invariably, you'll still have many of the same
poor and inner-city kids failing the test.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do?
</P>
<P>
   How about demand more from our public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference in the quality of inner-city schools and
suburban schools,'' Reeves said. ``A kid making A's and B's at one
school may have a hard time making C's at another school.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason that a student making A's at Inner City High
couldn't make the same kinds of grades at Suburban Hills High. Yet
unfortunately, that is exactly what has happened. This disparity of
the education is usually exposed with SAT testing, where one
student makes the passing score and the other one _ the one who
hasn't been exposed to some of the ideologies that an SAT exam may
go over _ doesn't pass.
</P>
<P>
   Should the student at Inner City High who is striving for
academic excellence be penalized because he wasn't taught the,
``SAT basics''? No. And sooner or later, we'll have to hold the
public schools accountable for that student's failure.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a problem that is too far-reaching for colleges
athletic programs to handle. Right now, to weed out who wants to
learn and who doesn't, who should be eligible to play college
sports and who shouldn't, colleges need Prop 16 to ensure that
college athletics does not become a playground for student-athletes
who have no chance as students.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping that Judge Buckwalter agrees. nn

 &HT;    East Regional: Tulsa vows not to be intimidated by Duke
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Tulsa has heard all the terms used this week
to described the No. 1 Duke Blue Devils: Unbeatable. Unstoppable.
Team of the Century. All that scary stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But to a man, the Golden Hurricanes (23-9) said Saturday they
will not be intimidated today when they face Duke and its 28-game
winning streak in the second round of the NCAA East Regional at the
Charlotte Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Duke (33-1) was more than a little intimidating in its opener
Friday night, beating Florida A&AMP;M by 41 (99-58). It could have very
easily been 81.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa, however, has already ended the 25-game winning streak
that belonged to the College of Charleston, which it beat 62-53
late Friday night. So why not go for another?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to back down from anybody,'' said sophomore
guard Marcus Hill. ``We're not going into this game looking for any
kind of moral victories. If we take care of the basketball and get
back on the break, we have a chance to be in this thing with five
minutes remaining. Then anything could happen. I don't think
anybody on this team thinks Duke is unbeatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are just the words that coach Bill Self wants to hear. He
believes that a team will never beat Duke unless it can play
without fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said I think Duke is the most talented team I've seen
since the end of the John Wooden era (at UCLA) and I still believe
that,'' said Self. ``So why not just go out and play and let's see
what happens?''
</P>
<P>
   A major reason Tulsa feels good about today's game is the
presence of senior forward Michael Ruffin, who may be the best
player you've never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-8 Ruffin, the school's all-time leading shot blocker and
rebounder, is Tulsa's designated defensive stopper. Over the course
of the last four years he has caused a lot of problems for many of
the WAC's best offensive players. Ruffin is expected to be matched
against Elton Brand, Duke's All-America center, in what should be a
classic battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's a guy who can dominate a game without ever
scoring,'' said Self. ``He does all the little things that help you
win. If he's playing well, he can play with anybody. But he'll have
to have a special game if we're going to have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand and Ruffin went head to head last summer in Seattle during
tryouts for the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember him being very physical and you can't back
down when he starts doing that,'' said Ruffin, who has 17
double-doubles this season. ``I don't think either one of us got
the better of it when we played.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruffin, from Englewood, Colo., is not your everyday basketball
player. He carries a 3.77 GPA in chemical engineering and has been
twice named an academic All-American. Ruffin can translate those
smarts to the court, said Self, and having faced Brand before will
be an advantage for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is a very intelligent person. He remembers another
player's tendencies and does a good job of taking away what a
player likes to do,'' said Self.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffin, who has played the most games in Tulsa history (127)
said he is very much looking forward to his matchup with Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the reason you play,'' said Ruffin. ``To get
an opportunity to play against one of the best players in the
country is very special.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   Langdon will be back
</P>
<P>
   Duke guard Trajon Langdon, who has missed three straight games
with a strained left foot, will be back in the starting lineup for
today's second-round East Regional game with Tulsa, coach Mike
Krzyzewski said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon, a first-team All-ACC performer, aggravated an old foot
injury against Virginia in the ACC Tournament on March 4. He then
sat out Duke's final two ACC Tournament games against N.C. State
and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Duke's leading scorer was fitted with a special
insert in his shoe in order to take the pressure off his injury. He
went through a light workout here on Thursday but did not play in
Friday's NCAA Tournament opener against Florida A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday Langdon finally went full speed in defensive
drills and Krzyzewski made the decision to play him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to do a few things with him to make sure he was ready
and now we think it's time to test it,'' said Krzyzewski.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski did not say how long Langdon would play, but it was
clear he wanted to get Langdon some minutes before next week's
regional semifinals in East Rutherford, N.J., which is where Duke
goes next if it wins today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned that we were picking up some bad habits,''
said Krzyzewski. ``Players sometimes pace themselves defensively
when they know a starter is out and you're not as deep. I don't
want us to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alford to Iowa?
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri State's Steve Alford is on a lot of
prospective coaching lists, including Georgia's. But the college
basketball grapevine has the former Indiana star being named the
head coach at Iowa after the Bears' run in the NCAA Tournament is
over.
</P>
<P>
   Alford, who is 155-76 in eight years as a head coach, says all
the speculation about his future is merely a compliment to his
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as this tournament is going on, we'll let other people
talk about that stuff because they are not talking to me,'' said
Alford, in his fourth year at SMS. ``Sure, it strokes your ego when
other people think you're doing a good job. But right now I'm just
focusing on keeping this season going.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for respect
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's all-time record in the NCAA Tournament is 6-12 and
the Vols have never won two games in a row in this event. So
winning today's game with Southwest Missouri State and advancing to
the Sweet 16 could be a huge shot in the arm for the Volunteer
program, said coach Jerry Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it. You don't get a lot of attention by sitting at
home,'' said Green, in his second year in Knoxville. ``You really
can't measure what this kind of exposure can do. It opens a lot of
doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgery for Coach K
</P>
<P>
   Mike Krzyzewski doesn't jump up and down off the bench as much
as he used to. It's not that he's mellowed. The Duke coach has a
bad hip that is scheduled to be replaced on April 5, about a week
after the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a set date has been really good,'' said Krzyzewski, 52.
``I'm looking forward to getting it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski will have about a two-month recovery period during
which he plans to start on a book about leadership.

 &HT;    Pro fishing's splashy look
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE LANIER, Ga. _ The Wal-Mart FLW Tour is dropping the green
flag on NASCAR-style marketing in the good ol' boy sport of
professional bass fishing.
</P>
<P>
   And Irwin Jacobs, the former corporate raider from Minneapolis
who has brought glitz, glamour and greenbacks to the sport in just
a few years, has the pedal to the metal.
</P>
<P>
   When Jacobs' professional tour _ called the FLW by most in the
industry _ comes to Lake Lanier this week for its third stop of the
1999 season, it will showcase a flashy new marketing ploy more in
line with something you'd see coming around the turn at Atlanta
Motor Speedway than working the shoreline up Wahoo Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The FLW is expected to showcase eight of its fleet of 10
brightly colored sponsor boats, each built by Ranger Boats to the
tune of more than $40,000, as part of the FLW's latest attempt to
wow bass-fishing enthusiasts, as well as put big smiles on the
faces of its major sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people who aren't even anglers to see the boats and
say, `My God, what is that?''' Jacobs said, applying the
advertising philosophy of increasing awareness of a product.
``They're a crowd-stopper, a crowd-pleaser. Each one of these is a
work of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Sayner, vice president of communications for Operation
Bass, said, ``They are knock-your-socks-off cool. They really give
a NASCAR flavor to bass fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   That comparison has been made more than once since Jacobs got
involved in bass tournaments in 1995. That's when he took over
Operation Bass, the Kentucky-based company that runs the
tournament, as well as two other national bass-fishing circuits.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he thought the sport _ ruled by the Bass Anglers
Sportsman Society for most of the previous 30 years _ was spinning
its wheels. Since then, his lead-foot leadership has made the
made-for-TV tournament trail the biggest name-dropper in an
industry that benefits from the interests of 50 million U.S.
anglers.
</P>
<P>
   With Jacobs behind the wheel, the FLW offers big payoffs _
$100,000 goes to the winner of the Lanier event, and the total of
$471,500 is the largest purse in Georgia history _ and attracts
nontraditional sponsors not tied to the outdoors or fishing.
</P>
<P>
   This week, five of the boats will be used in the final round
Saturday, but all 10 are expected to be ready for future
tournaments and to be used in the final two rounds, which are
broadcast on ESPN and ESPN2. Qualifying anglers can win additional
money if they wear the company's colors while fishing. Obviously,
sponsors stand to get high exposure with their boats shown on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said the cost for a company to sponsor a boat is
``confidential, but I can tell you it's a lot cheaper than
sponsoring a NASCAR car.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the boats debuted in the recent FLW tournament at Lake
Murray, S.C., and they were a hit with the fans, according to
Charlie Hoover, Operation Bass president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are probably the most exciting things that have
happened to professional bass fishing besides the fishing itself,''
Hoover said. ``They generated a lot of enthusiasm (at Lake Murray).
People wanted to know where they could get one.''
</P>
<P>
   The top-of-the-line Ranger (518 DVX model) runs $36,000 fully
rigged with a 200 horsepower Evinrude motor and various other
features, according to Hoover. Another $10,000 or so has gone into
customizing it with the sponsor's colors and inlaid carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're something else,'' said Larry Lewis of H.D. Marine in
Buford, where many of the boats are being stored until the
tournament. ``We've had a lot of people come by and look at 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   The boats, which will be on display at the parking lot of the
Wal-Mart Supercenter in Gainesville, will spin off at least a
couple of more products. The boats will be featured in an updated
computer game _ in which players can win Angler of the Year and be
put on the cover of a Wheaties box like angling superstar Denny
Brauer _ and a line of models is expected to be ready by the fall.
Both products will be sold only at Wal-Marts. Also, Ranger will
provide boats for pros to use in tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making bass fishing a spectator sport is my No. 1 priority,''
Jacobs says. ``We've just begun.''
</P>

 &HT;    Not-so-Great Gretzky
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two months ago, he was back in his familiar position
as the NHL's famous glorious adjective: the Great One. Wayne
Gretzky scored a goal, assisted on two others, was named the Most
Valuable Player of the All-Star Game in Tampa and for one night
looked far younger than his 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the only thing great is how the New York Rangers sometimes
perform without Gretzky, and the league's all-time point producer
looks 38 going on shuffleboard.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky has not played since Feb. 22 because of a disc
protrusion in his cervical spine. He had a cortisone shot Tuesday
and will be re-evaluated by doctors this week, but chances are he
is at least a week from returning. Neck and back injuries are never
a good thing, particularly for a 38-year-old who has been playing
as a pro since he was 16. That some wonder if Gretzky will be back
at all this season is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only part of the story in New York. Gretzky has not
scored a goal since Feb. 4, and that's his only goal since the
All-Star Game. He has only eight goals this season and carries a
shockingly ill plus-minus rating of minus-21, which not only is the
worst on the Rangers by far but ranks among the dregs in the league
(he's one of the few that low without a Tampa Bay address).
</P>
<P>
   Has New York fallen apart without him? No. In fact, the Rangers,
thought to be comatose during the playoff stretch, went 5-0-1 in
their first six games without Gretzky until a loss Wednesday to
Ottawa. New York, getting terrific efforts from veterans Petr
Nedved, Brian Leetch and Adam Graves and a handful of newcomers
like Marc Savard and Manny Malhotra, moved back into the postseason
chase that finds five teams (New York, Florida, Boston, Washington,
Montreal) still in contention for one spot in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, some in Manhattan are wondering if the Rangers will be
given a boost if and when Gretzky returns. There's little question
his teammates have elevated their play in his absence. If he should
come back and play 30 minutes a game, taking up the ice time of
others, will it help or hurt?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we need Wayne Gretzky back,'' coach John Muckler said.
``We'll be a better hockey club when Wayne comes back. When you can
add a player of his caliber, good things can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky has not said for certain that he will play beyond this
season, though he has a year remaining on his contract. General
manager Neil Smith has indicated that when the Rangers allowed Mark
Messier to sign with Vancouver, the decision was made to rebuild
the organization with youth. That seemingly counters Gretzky's
belief that the Rangers would try to get him some high-priced
scoring help to make another run at the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky wanted out of Los Angeles because he didn't want to be a
part of another rebuilding process. He doesn't want out of New
York. He likes living and playing here. But a few more wins without
Gretzky and a nudge out the door wouldn't be all that surprising,
which isn't quite the way the Great One should be remembered.

 &HT;    NHL EAST NOTES: Phree Phalling
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz

   Philadelphia coach Roger Neilson is running out of excuses for
the Flyers' sudden tumble. Any thoughts the team needed more speed
or scoring punch to make a run at the Stanley Cup ended when
general manager Bob Clarke acquired former Flyer and impending free
agent Mark Recchi from Montreal. But even with Recchi scoring a
goal in his debut, the Flyers lost at home to Colorado 5-3. The
Flyers' defense has been playing giveaway in their own end, making
life difficult for goalie John Vanbiesbrouck. And with Philly
tumbling to 2-10-4 following a 16-1-7 streak, you knew this had to
happen: There are rumors of friction between Clarke and Neilson.
Clarke reportedly ordered the coach to start rookie goalie
Jean-Marc Pelletier against Ottawa, and the result was a 5-0 loss.
One rumor has Neilson being fired and replaced by former Flyers
coach Mike Keenan. We are not making this up. But Keenan might
have.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes scholar
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa goalie Damian Rhodes may be playing his way right into a
Thrashers uniform. The backup posted his second shutout in three
starts when he stopped 29 shots in a 3-0 win Wednesday against the
Rangers in New York, raising his record to 19-11-3 and dropping his
goals-against average to 2.48. The Senators likely will protect Ron
Tugnutt before the expansion draft and leave Rhodes exposed in the
expansion draft. To protect both goalies would require them to
leave more of their young defensemen or forwards unprotected.
Rhodes, who originally came up with Toronto, also was impressive
last season for the Senators, particularly in the playoffs,
allowing 21 goals in 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Front-office shuffle
</P>
<P>
   New Tampa Bay owner Bill Davidson denies he has decided to bring
in coach Steve Ludzik from the IHL's Detroit Vipers (another
Davidson property), but there's little question Jacques Demers'
business card is about to either change or be burned entirely.
Demers will lose at least one of his two job descriptions, coach
and general manager. Even if he remains GM, a lot of the power is
expected to shift to current club adviser Cliff Fletcher, the
former Flames executive who clearly is a favorite of the new owner.
Demers is not about to whine. ``If the best thing for the team is
for me to do one thing, then I'll do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Etc. ...
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Barnaby, on getting his trade request fulfilled, from
Buffalo to Pittsburgh: ``It got to the point where the only time I
felt happy was when I heard my name in trade rumors, and that's not
right.'' ... Scott Lachance wasn't upset to escape New York when
the Islanders shipped him to Montreal for a third-round draft pick,
but he feared for his old teammates: ``No matter which way you look
at it, a third-round pick won't help (the Islanders) for four or
five years, so it's got to be frustrating for the guys on the team.
I just hope this isn't an indication of what's going to happen. I
hope it isn't what it seems it is.'' Which is to say, a salary
dumping. Lance Pitlick

 &HT;    NHL NOTES: Thrashers update
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not that it will make a significant difference in the
Thrashers' expansion draft, but the NHL has closed a loophole on
teams signing players to voidable option years. The issue arose a
few weeks ago when it was learned Edmonton general manager Glen
Sather planned to sign defenseman Marty McSorley to a one-year,
$2.3 million extension, which would amount to a $1.3 million raise
next year. The deal would be at the Oilers' option and would expire
June 30, five days after the expansion draft. All existing teams
are required to make one veteran defenseman and two forwards
available to the Thrashers in the expansion draft, with veteran
defined as someone who played at least 40 games this year or 70 in
the last two. Sather's belief was that Atlanta never would claim
McSorley because of his contract. The Oilers would then let the
option expire and re-sign McSorley for far less, which would suit
the player fine because he would rather stay in Edmonton.
Regardless, the league has slammed the door on the rule
circumvention, saying any option deals now can no longer expire in
June. It's a little late, though. Last year, there were 18 players
signed to option deals before Nashville's expansion draft. There
were already 74 players signed to option deals before the NHL's new
mandate last week, although maybe none as extreme as McSorley's.
The McSorley deal will stand because the new rule was not
implemented until after the fact. Alluding to the option deals
already signed by players, Thrashers general manager Don Waddell
said: ``It was a smart play on their part.'' Columbus and
Minnesota, which come into the league in the 2000-01 season, figure
to benefit from the league's new position more than the Thrashers.
GOING OVERTIME
</P>
<P>
   For those who have missed it, the AHL has been cooperating with
the NHL to experiment with a new format to break ties, skating four
players (plus the goalie) a side in overtime. Not surprisingly,
ties are way down. In the first 17 games tied after three periods,
10 games (59 percent) were decided in the extra period. The AHL's
normal average, with a normal five-on-five format, is 33 percent of
ties being broken in overtime. The NHL's current average is 26
percent. One reason the AHL's percentage is higher is the league
automatically gives each team one point for tying in regulation,
whereas the NHL doesn't. That point gives each team more incentive
to go for a win in overtime, knowing it will not come away empty
handed if it gambles and loses the game.

 &HT;    NHL WEST NOTES: Dead Wings?
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the party isn't over in Detroit after consecutive Stanley
Cups, the Red Wings are creating a pretty atypical backdrop for a
team getting ready to start another title run. Defenseman Uwe Krupp
has been out since Dec. 19 with a back injury and still has
numbness in a foot. He has been assured his career isn't over, but
the same can't be said for this season, so the pressure is on
general manager Ken Holland to make a trade. But there are other
problems. Detroit took a 1-4-2 streak into the weekend and had
scored on only three of 25 power plays. The Wings couldn't manage
even one shot during a four-minute power play against struggling
Los Angeles. Things aren't much better off the ice, where assistant
coaches Dave Lewis and Barry Smith are signed only through this
season but being left in limbo because of Scotty Bowman's uncertain
(again) future. There is reason to believe that Holland probably
would promote an assistant (likely Lewis) if the Wings have a great
playoff run and Bowman retires. But if Detroit is bounced quickly,
the team may start with a new face. Lewis has hired an agent to
explore job opportunities. Smith has been particularly outspoken,
saying, ``A few years ago you thought you had your cards in your
hand _ you thought there was something out there. I'm not going to
do that any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Desert storm
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that the only win during the Wings' skid came
against Phoenix, which lost for the 11th time in 13 games at home
to lowly Vancouver the other night. Goaltending and defense have
taken most of the blame, but those areas don't excuse getting shut
out by the Canucks. ``There is nobody _ and I mean nobody _ to
blame but the players on the ice,'' Keith Tkachuk said. ``It's
ridiculous. It's brutal. It's the total team.'' The Coyotes are in
danger of losing home ice in the first round of the playoffs to
Anaheim. ``We can't coast in,'' Tkachuk said. ``So we came out
strong early (in the season), it doesn't mean (expletive). If we're
not careful, we'll coast right out of the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc. ...
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix backup goalie Jim Waite's struggles and subsequent
demotion to the minors is being blamed on significant weight loss
(22 pounds) since the start of season. Waite acknowledges he has
hasn't felt strong in many games and has suffered from dehydration.
... Calgary coach Brian Sutter, after the Flames went 3-1 in their
first four games without Theoren Fleury: ``It's a wonder there's
not a lot of dead people in town. So many people are jumping on and
off our bandwagon.'' ... Mark Messier, who has been out for three
weeks with a sprained knee, acknowledges that he is not rushing
back from the injury because the Canucks are out of the playoff
chase. ``I'd be lying if I said it wouldn't alter the thinking,''
he said. ``I've had a tendency in the past to rush back to help
when I wasn't 100 percent, and maybe it wasn't the smartest thing
to do. I don't want to hurt myself further and jeopardize the next
five years.'' ... Steve Duchesne ($11.25 million) is an official
free agent bust. He was a healthy scratch for L.A. the other night.
``He's not willing to pay the price to make a play,'' coach Larry
Robinson said.

 &HT;    NCAA SOUTH REGIONAL: Auburn's kid is the man
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ If Auburn was to finally return to the Sweet 16,
then a child shall lead them. But then, Scott Pohlman only looks
like a kid. On Saturday, the reed-thin kid was the man for Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   The little sophomore guard scored a career-high 28 points,
including both ends of a 1-and-1 with 13 seconds left that
certified Auburn's 81-74 win over Oklahoma State in the second
round of the NCAA South Region at the RCA Dome. The top-seeded
Tigers (29-3) now advance to their third Sweet 16 and the regional
finals Thursday night in Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn also got 17 points from Bryant Smith and 13 from Doc
Robinson. But it was Pohlman who led the Tigers to their first
Sweet 16 since 1986. He hit 11-of-17 shots, including 2-of-3
3-pointers, and all four of his free throw attempts. Adrian
Peterson led OSU (23-11) with 27 points and Desmond Mason had 26.
</P>
<P>
   Pohlman's jumper had given Auburn a 10-point lead, 67-57, with
6:08 left before OSU rallied behind Peterson and Mason. Joe Adkins'
3-pointer with 1:20 left cut it to 74-72. But Pohlman hit a jumper
in the lane after making contact with Brian Montonati, who tried
unsuccessfully to draw a charge. When Chris Porter inadvertently
tipped in an OSU miss, Mamadou N'Diaye sank one free throw. Then
Smith and Pohlman hit 1-and-1's to clinch it.
</P>
<P>
   Pohlman is still a teenager, won't turn 20 until May 30 and
looks like he should be playing for Gene Hackman and Hickory High
in ''Hoosiers.'' Of all the players at this site, Pohlman most
resembled a Hoosier gym rat, the Indiana high school legends who've
become almost mythic in this state.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday afternoon, in the same city where the Indiana
state high school championship will be decided later this month,
Pohlman showed these Hoosiers that skinny little kids from Roswell
can play some hoops, too.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first half, Oklahoma State had the slow-paced
game it needed against Auburn and an 18-15 lead. Unfazed by the
Tigers' press, the Cowboys played tough man-to-man defense and got
six points from Desmond Mason to take that three-point lead. Then
came Pohlman, with a face like Opie Taylor and body by Barney.
Barney Fife.
</P>
<P>
   ''What he's done is matured,'' said Auburn coach Cliff Ellis.
''He's always been a player, just knows how to play. Doesn't look
like it when he's warming up. He's one of those guys who doesn't
look like he's going to sit there and bite you, but he does.''
</P>
<P>
   He devoured Oklahoma State for the rest of the half. Pohlman
scored his first points on two free throws with 9:20 left in the
half. Then he embarked on an all-you-can-chew Cowboy buffet,
scoring the game's next 11 points to put Auburn ahead 30-21.
</P>
<P>
   Working against OSU's Glendon Alexander, Pohlman scored first on
a jumper, then another when Doc Robinson drove and dished.
</P>
<P>
   Moving nicely to his left to catch an inbounds pass, Pohlman
caught it, turned without dribbling and stuck another jumper.
Auburn's full-court pressure finally got to Oklahoma, which
committed turnovers on three straight possessions. Pohlman then
sank his first 3-pointer, then a layup on another inbounds pass for
Auburn's biggest lead of the half, 30-21.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Oklahoma State had drawn within 37-33 despite 13
points from Pohlman, 12 from Bryant Smith and 12 Cowboys' turnovers
- one less than their average.
</P>
<P>
   Once Pohlman opened the second half with a jumper, Robinson and
Adrian Peterson played some one-upmanship. Robinson scored seven
straight Auburn points, sandwiching a 3-pointer with two
short-range jumpers. Peterson sank two jumpers of his own, then
later a 3 that cut it to 52-47.
</P>
<P>
   Pohlman, having rested for a couple of minutes, returned and
promptly loosed a 3-point airball from the top of the key. That
allowed Desmond Mason to score and draw OSU within 52-51. After
three Auburn misses, Peterson's 3-ball that would've finally given
OSU the lead rattled around and out. Then, it was Pohlman's time
again.
</P>
<P>
   He scored on a fast break off Peterson's miss, then made a
pretty pump-up-and-under move to easily score inside for a 56-51
lead. The littlest guy on the was playing the biggest. He was also
playing the point with Robinson sitting with four personals. No
problem. Coming out of an Auburn timeout, Pohlman drained another 3
to give himself a career-high 22 points and the Tigers a 63-55
advantage.

Knight's best days are behind him
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Some things change with time. Some things just
get old.
</P>
<P>
   Here were creaking legs, a heaving chest and a head hung so low
you might have thought there were lead weights holding it down as
the laboring figure climbed the steps to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Knight looked positively ancient.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, so did his Hoosiers, suddenly as out of place at the
Big Dance as a fellow with two left feet and no sense of rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   As the 21st century approaches, Knight's storied Indiana program
appears to be more suited for the horse-and-buggy days.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's not only had a better basketball team than the
Hoosiers by a wide 86-61 margin. They had quicker, faster,
stronger, better players all over the floor of the Orlando Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we played five more times, I'm not sure we'd ever beat
them,'' Knight said wearily.
</P>
<P>
   Which says, as much as anything, about the state of Indiana
basketball in the state he used to hold practically in the palm of
his hand.
</P>
<P>
   It's no longer a sure bet that Knight would be elected Indiana's
governor if he chose to run for office.
</P>
<P>
   His weekly TV show is no longer a ratings hit on par with ER.
</P>
<P>
   Home games in Bloomington and Indianapolis are no longer
automatic sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   He is no longer a fashion trendsetter when he changes to a new
style of red sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, his teams have become virtually irrelevant amid
the madness of March.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA exits getting uglier
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Storm picked up the Hoosiers in the swirling winds
of an aggressive zone defense and an attacking, unselfish offense
and tossed them around like so much patio furniture on Saturday
afternoon, it marked the sixth straight year that Indiana (22-11)
has failed to make it past the second round of the NCAA Tournament,
with five straight exits coming via double-digit losses.
</P>
<P>
   Since their last appearance in the Sweet 16 and last Big Ten
title in 1993, the Hoosiers have been bounced in the first round
four times, and their elimination losses have grown increasingly
ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago at Greensboro, N.C., in what was Dean Smith's
retirement run, the great Tar Heels coach and Knight were on track
for a legendary meeting in the second round of the Tournament. But
the meeting never occurred because the Hoosiers were flattened
80-62 by Colorado in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   This most recent wipeout was Knight's worst in the Tourney as
St. John's completely smothered Indiana's motion attack with a
basic 3-2 zone and ran an offense that moved the ball around until
finding the best possible shot.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the ball movement, the precision passing and
the unselfish style displayed by the Red Storm's Ron Artest, Erick
Barkley, Bootsy Thornton and Lavor Postell is what we used to see
from Indiana. The sharp cuts, the clean, razor's edge plays, the
skill of surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about just saying that they have a better team than us?''
said Knight.
</P>
<P>
   A better team because the talent level is now so much higher at
St. John's and most other places than at Indiana. And that likely
has much to do with Knight and his unyielding ways.
</P>
<P>
   Paying a price for rigidity
</P>
<P>
   Mike Krzyzewski learned the game at Knight's knee and will
always be a devoted disciple. But Coach K's Duke teams have
expanded upon all those principles and incorporated NBA-level
talent into the program. Mike Jarvis, the St. John's coach, spoke
fondly of learning so much about the game from Knight. Yet Jarvis
has more raw athletic talent on his bench than Knight does in his
starters, save A.J. Guyton.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Knight's rigid, abrasive manner is finally catching up
to him in the manner that hurts him most as a coach. He isn't
interested in the kids who only want to stay for a year or two and
then move on to the NBA, and the top-level talent among four-year
players doesn't want to listen to him. And after 28 years at
Indiana, it shows.
</P>
<P>
   It was country bumpkins, wide-eyed and innocent, vs. city kids
just out there to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say the Red Storm simply runs and guns. For a
team with such individual ability, St. John's plays so smart and in
unison. Open 3-pointers in the corner are passed up in favor of
more-open 3-pointers on the wing. Six-foot jump shots in the lane
are suddenly passes whipped around the back of an unsuspecting
defender to produce layups or dunks.
</P>
<P>
   Artest, a sophomore, will likely head to the NBA next season,
and he will succeed. Barkley, a freshman from Brooklyn, says his
idol is John Stockton. When have you heard that from a New York
kid?
</P>
<P>
   And when is the last time anybody feared Bob Knight in March?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I give a lot of thought to is when I'm going
fishing next,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, mostly, as the bait.

FIREBOMBS KILL 13 IN WESTERN TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN GORVETT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ In the deadliest attacks in western Turkey in years,
assailants hurled firebombs into a mall crowded with shoppers
Saturday afternoon, killing 13 people. The attack prompted new
security measures in the nation's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
   There was no claim of responsibility for the bombing and fire,
which tore through the six-story Mavi Carsi shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was the third in recent days in Istanbul, and it was
conducted amid a campaign of violence after the Turkish arrest last
month in Kenya of Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish separatist leader.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit accused the assailants of trying to
spread panic ahead of general elections on April 18.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's attack was the deadliest in Istanbul since a leftist
bombing killed 12 people in 1991. It began when three assailants
rushed into the mall, threw a number of firebombs onto the ground
floor, thenescaped, witnesses said. The bombs quickly set the mall
ablaze, trapping customers who had rushed upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them were probably killed because there was no fire
escape,'' the Turkish television channel NTV reported.
</P>
<P>
   Eight others were injured, two of them seriously, after jumping
from a second-floor window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three people were on the roof and tried to jump,'' said Basak
Ozkeceli, a passerby. ``They were shouting for help, then
disappeared in the smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the ruined building, only red ``sale'' signs and a
grotesque tangle of mannequins remained inside ground-floor display
windows.
</P>
<P>
   The attack followed a car bombing Wednesday outside an upscale
shopping center that killed a taxi driver and wounded eight
pedestrians. Hours later Wednesday, another car bomb exploded
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, a bomb exploded in the car of the governor of the
central Turkish region of Cankiri, killing a 14-year-old girl and
seriously wounding the official.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous bomb attacks, often targeting commercial properties and
bars, have also occurred in Ankara, the capital, and in Izmir.
However, Saturday's attack was the first firebombing to occur in
broad daylight, said Sabri Yalim, the regional fire chief. He
inferred that the bombers had intended to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Istanbul's governor, Erol Cakir, saying he expected further
attacks, ordered identity checks on public transportation and told
the public not to accept parcels from strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying hard with the police force and gendarmerie,'' or
paramilitary police, to protect citizens throughout the city of 12
million people, Cakir told Turkish television. ``We have issued
warnings to places where crowds go that they should take measures
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The attacks have been attributed largely to the Turkish Workers'
and Peasants Liberation Army, who, according to the Turkish police
minister, Necati Bilican, claimed responsibility for the attack on
the Cankiri governor.
</P>
<P>
   However, supporters of Ocalan's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
are widely blamed for these attacks. The Turkish Workers' and
Peasants Liberation Army and other leftist groups have cooperated
with the Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these terrorists think that they can achieve anything with
their banditry, or save the person who has been encouraging them,
they are wrong,'' Prime Minister Ecevit said, referring to Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Kurdish rebel leader's arrest and return to Turkey
to face trial, Ocalan's group issued a statement through the
newspaper Ozgur Politika calling on ``all Kurds to explode in the
heart of the enemy.'' That call was literally observed in the
eastern city of Batman where, on March 4, a woman blew herself up
outside a police station, wounding three bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, the Kurdish rebels also claimed to have downed a
Turkish Army helicopter, killing 20 soldiers on board. The Turkish
military denied the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns are mounting that with Ocalan's capture, the 15-year
war between the Turkish military and his rebel force, fought mainly
in the mountainous southeast, may be moving into a new phase of
urban violence. About 30,000 people have been killed so far.
</P>
<P>
   Security concerns are high not only for next month's elections
but for the Kurdish spring celebration of Newroz on March 21. The
holiday has often been a flashpoint between Kurdish nationalists
and Turkish security forces.

RECORD BETS BUOY LONE STAR PARK OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
 STAR PARK-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Buoyed by a record simulcast handle in
February and a fast start this month, Lone Star Park is flying high
as another thoroughbred racing season approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-day meeting begins April 15, a month from Monday, and
continues through July 25.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star took $16.7 million in simulcast bets in February, a
record for the month and an average of almost $700,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   That bodes well for the resumption of live racing, said track
assistant general manager Steve Sexton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows us two things,'' he said. ``One, that people are
becoming more educated about wagering and are more confident. And
it also shows that the awareness level of racing in North Texas has
been heightened, which continues to be one of our primary goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lone Star equaled or bettered its attendance and
betting numbers from the inaugural thoroughbred meet in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was quite a feat,'' Sexton said. ``But we've set the bar
one level higher this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The major thoroughbred racing events at Lone Star are the
opening-weekend tandem of the $300,000 Lone Star Derby and $250,000
Texas Mile (the track's first graded stakes) on April 18; the first
Lone Star Million Day on May 31, featuring seven races totaling $1
million in purses; and the popular NTRA All-Star Jockey
Championship on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the big names at the track last year will return, with
the notable exception of the horses owned by John Franks and
trained by Bobby Barnett. The Franks horses will be kept at
Churchill Downs in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Walden, who trains Belmont Stakes winner Victory Gallop,
has expressed interest in dividing his Kentucky-based stable and
sending about 20 horses to Lone Star. Walden finished among the
country's top 10 trainers in purse earnings in 1998, and among his
clients are Houston owners Art, Jack and J.R. Preston.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent media release, Lone Star also is spending
$500,000 on facility improvements, including a Pavilion Patio with
seating for groups of up to 300 being built in the beer garden
between the stands and the Post Time Pavilion simulcast center.
Also, the dirt racing surface is being reformulated.
</P>
<P>
   General admission is being increased from $2 to $2.50, but a
book of 15 live-racing admission tickets will be available
beginning April 1 for $25. nn

JONES: COWBOYS WILL BE PRODUCTIVE IN FREE AGENCY
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While in Tampa, Fla., a week ago, Jerry Jones received an
invitation he couldn't refuse. The Boss wanted some company in his
private suite at a Yankees' exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   So there they sat for nine innings. The most powerful owner in
baseball and the most powerful owner in football, joined by Catfish
Hunter and Phil Rizzuto.
</P>
<P>
   This could have been the ultimate socks-and-jocks summit
meeting. George Steinbrenner and Jerry Jones _ in pro sports, it
doesn't get any more hands-on than that. Get these two together and
you've got one of those U.N. debates during the Cold War days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually not,'' Jones said. ``I spent all day just listening.
It was fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, I tend to doubt Jones being totally mum in this
situation. But if so, it continues a trend.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't Jerry and the Cowboys been way too quiet in the
off-season? Here it is mid-March, and a team desperately needing to
make a free-agent impact has done exactly nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Salary-cap problems, yes. Massive overspending around the league
driving up free-agent salaries, yes. But sad songs and waltzes
still aren't selling in Fort Worth-Dallas this year, not with that
painful Arizona playoff memory so vivid.
</P>
<P>
   The quickest way, however, to start Jones talking is by calling
the Cowboys docile in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``My comment on that,'' said Jerry, getting his back up, ``is we
will accomplish more in this off-season than we've ever done with
free agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. Then when?
</P>
<P>
   ``By us going slow, it shouldn't be considered a negative,''
continued Jones on Friday, as he prepared to accompany Chan Gailey
and other coaches to Ohio for a workout session for a college
player. ``There have been a lot of blockbuster signings thus far,
but I also contend the big-money free agents have mainly been busts
in our league. We had to let the first wave go by, and now we will
catch the next wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones confirmed the obvious _ that speed receiver Rocket Ismail,
center Mark Stepnoski and linebacker Quentin Coryatt are top
priorities on the Cowboys' current list of free-agent desires.
Ismail's agent has said the Rocket will announce today if he stays
with the Carolina Panthers or signs with Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we are looking at filling a need at those three
positions,'' said Jones. ``As far as the three names, it's not
wrong to link them to us. But at two of the three positions, if we
miss on those names, then we have a good fall-back option. My
opinion is that market-wise, we can be competitive, and will
improve our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones brought up last year's free-agent class as an example of
upgrading, but then backtracked on Everett McIver, Ernie Mills and
Chris Warren. ``I guess all of them did end up injured, didn't
they,'' he said. ``But when they were on the field, they make us
better.''
</P>
<P>
   One change for the Cowboys this time is that free agency will
dictate how selections are made in the April 17-18 NFL Draft. ``If
we sign the players we need, that gives us a chance to do what we
should do in the draft _ take the best player available instead of
drafting for position,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   So as quiet as it's been thus far in free agency, the priority
to do something remains very high.
</P>
<P>
   As does Jones' energy level and league-wide impact. He spent a
week in Tampa as a member of the NFL's powerful competition
committee, and will be in Phoenix today for the opening of the
owner's meetings. Jerry will hit the desert running, conducting a
campaign among fellow owners on such subjects as the return of
instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got the 23 votes to get this thing passed,'' he
said. ``What we (the competition committee) came up with on instant
replay seems to have been well-received.''
</P>
<P>
   If approved, instant replay for next season will fall under
these new guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   A coach will have two challenges on questionable calls until the
two-minute mark of a game. A timeout will be lost if the play is
not overturned. In the last two minutes, there will be a league
appointed ``eye-in-the-sky,'' working with the officiating crew to
review any questionable call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can improve the game with this,'' said Jones, who
also remains confident free agency will improve his team.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, it's iffy on both counts. If George
really did all the talking last week, it's past time for Jerry to
be heard. nn

FOCUS OF IRISH TALKS SHIFTS TO WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The peace process in Northern Ireland will shift
temporarily this week to Washington, where President Clinton will
use St. Patrick's Day to urge the various parties to reach
compromise in the stalled efforts to revive local government after
27 years of direct rule from London.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, politicians from Northern Ireland have descended
on the White House, looking for support, not to mention the
``craic,'' or fun, to be had at the legions of Beltway St.
Patrick's Day parties. And each year, Clinton finds himself in a
similar position, asked to mediate what seems to be an intractable
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, politicians from Northern Ireland reached the Good
Friday Agreement just three weeks after returning from a series of
parties and pep talks in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton slapped backs, promised investment, and urged Irish
nationalist and British unionist politicians to write themselves
into history by ending centuries of conflict. There were similar
promises of support on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who negotiated the agreement gave Clinton credit
for steeling their nerves and encouraging them to jettison old
shibboleths to reach a compromise. His telephone calls to Belfast
in the waning hours of the negotiating deadline last year were
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, it remains unclear what Clinton can offer
the various politicians and paramilitary groups that the British
and Irish governments have not already offered in an attempt to end
the stalemate over IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
   That stalemate forced the British government last week to
postpone until April 2 the deadline for handing over home-rule
powers to the new Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 people are expected to attend the celebration on
Wednesday. While the party is usually held in the East Room, White
House officials say this year's crowd is so big, probably the
biggest ever, that they are going to put a tent on the South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The unionists, led by the Nobel Peace Prize co-winner David
Trimble, are refusing to form a power-sharing executive that would
include members of Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political
wing, because the IRA has refused to turn in any of its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Unionist paramilitaries are also reluctant to give up their guns
ahead of IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   The Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, points out that nothing in
the Good Friday Agreement links the disarming of the IRA with his
party's taking two seats on the 10-member executive that they won
in an election.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA says it has no intention of giving up any weapons,
insisting that it did not surrender when it renewed its cease-fire
in 1997, but that it merely committed itself to allowing democratic
politics to replace its militaristic campaign to establish a united
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from the White House, a senior
administration official said the president will not propose a
specific compromise to the weapons dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no negotiating sessions,'' the official said,
speaking on the condition he was not identified. ``We won't broker
deals. Those things have to happen back in Belfast.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said the president's message, in his keynote speech
Wednesday and in private meetings with each of the party leaders,
will be ``to provide perspective and context, to remind them of
their accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials are hoping the change of scene will help
the politicians from Northern Ireland to realize how far they have
come, and how much they could lose if they fail to reach a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting off the island has its advantages,'' one official
said. ``You're away from the normal constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, away from the fishbowl of Belfast, and encouraged
by impressive surroundings and powerful hosts, rivals from Northern
Ireland have been able to talk and act more openly.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments have tried just about
everything to get the unionists and republicans to soften their
positions, believing that if one side made a gesture the other
would quickly follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But in what is a measure of the absence of goodwill among the
parties, and of the governments' increasing desperation, both
London and Dublin consider the annual pilgrimage to the White House
more important this year than before.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Mo Mowlam, Britain's top official in Northern
Ireland, said she hoped Clinton could find ground to compromise
where she and her Irish counterparts could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that just providing an environment for people to meet
and talk in a relaxed fashion will help build up some of the
confidence we need to move forward in the weeks ahead,'' Mowlam
said.

SEARCH IS ON FOR `THE NEXT ONE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a little guy, Wayne Gretzky casts a giant shadow.
</P>
<P>
   It's five championships wide and nine Hart Trophies tall and as
ominous as the ghostly spectre of 215 points in one season.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky, for many, is the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   But with The Great One having just turned 38, currently
wrestling a neck injury and, in many ways, already having been
swallowed up by the shadow himself, the question is often asked,
who will be The Next One?
</P>
<P>
   Who takes the torch from Gretzky and carries the NHL into the
new millenium? Who sells hockey when the greatest salesman on earth
finally draws a well-deserved pension?
</P>
<P>
   The Stars and their fans are getting a close look. Paul Kariya
and Teemu Selanne of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim were in town on
Friday. The Stars face Eric Lindros and the Flyers on Sunday night
in Philadelphia and then will visit Jaromir Jagr and the Penguins
on Tuesday. And to round out the week, Alexei Yashin and the Ottawa
Senators will visit Reunion Arena on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In that group are five players who are drawing MVP mention this
season, as well as the Stars' own million-dollar salesman Mike
Modano.
</P>
<P>
   So who wants the torch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne Gretzky the player is one thing, Wayne Gretzky the
person is another thing,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``I
don't know that any one person can replace him. But we can all
learn from what he's done. To me what was so great about Wayne
Gretzky was he was a great salesman; you couldn't help but feel how
excited he was about the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And how excited the game felt about him.
</P>
<P>
   What Gretzky delivered was a mix of skill, excitement, winning
and records that likely will never be matched in the history of the
NHL. So maybe it's pointless to try to look for ``The Next One.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will ever match his records, nobody. The game has
changed too much,'' Stars winger Pat Verbeek said. ``So maybe
that's the problem, maybe we shouldn't be looking for the player
who can be just like him, maybe the next great player is one who
does something completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros is in many ways the antithesis of Gretzky. The Great One
is small and swift. Lindros is 6-foot-4 and 230 pounds and may be
one of the most punishing hitters in the league. Gretzky is a
magician, Lindros a tank.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean he's not worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindros is such a different player than Gretzky. You can still
sell that though,'' Verbeek said. ``He has such tremendous power
and he plays such an aggressive game. That's what people want to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros has the numbers to become a superstar. He is second in
the NHL in scoring with 87 points (37 goals, 50 assists), is one of
the league's top faceoff men and also is among the top hitters. He
leads the league at a plus-35 and should be drawing all sorts of
MVP talk.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he doesn't. What Lindros gets most is talk about
disappointment, about how he has never lived up to the hype that
made him the first overall pick in the 1991 entry draft, about the
skirmish that forced a trade from the Quebec Nordiques to the
Flyers when Lindros, then 18, refused to play for the Nordiques.
</P>
<P>
   No one talks about his 1995 Hart Trophy as league MVP, they
prefer to talk about the 1997 sweep of his Flyers against the Red
Wings in the Stanley Cup Finals. It's hard to be The Next One when
you can't win The Big One.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that probably goes for everyone,'' said Modano, who
has deftly avoided talk of being anyone's savior. ``Until you win
at least one Stanley Cup, and probably a couple or three, nobody is
going to consider you great.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano, in fact, said he'd just as soon not hoist the mantle of
greatness on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always talk about some guy coming along to carry the
torch, but I don't think anyone ever will,'' Modano said. ``First
of all, I'm not sure anyone could do it if he wanted; and then, a
lot of guys don't want that responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano's boyish good looks, easy going way with the media and
maneuverability on the ice make him a candidate to be one of the
league's top salesmen. But he sees himself more as a Steve
Yzerman-type _ a sturdy, two-way player who will be quietly judged
on a long career and (he hopes) a few championships rather than any
kind of run at the Hart Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   He saves talk of salesmen for the European players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would I pay to watch? Jagr, (Pavel) Bure, the European
players,'' Modano said, before chuckling to himself at a
revelation. ``Maybe that's why we're in trouble, the guys we got
selling the game don't even speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   But players such as Jagr, Bure and Selanne speak another
language _ one of fun. The Penguins' Jagr carries his team, mixes
the skill of Gretzky with the strength of Lindros _ and has a nifty
salute when he scores goals. He's the early favorite to win the
Hart Trophy this season. Bure, with his speed, has played just two
months in Miami after a trade from the Canucks and already has
South Florida abuzz about the game of hockey. Selanne might have
more personality than any NHL player if you can get through his
thick Finnish accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important, you have to look after the fans and treat
people well,'' Selanne said of his philosophy of selling hockey.
``It's just part of our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Selanne has gone a long way in helping Kariya become more of a
public figure. Kariya is painfully shy and likes his privacy _ not
unlike former superstar Mario Lemieux. But Kariya is making a
concerted effort to be more available to the media and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be yourself out there, no matter if your Mike
Modano or Eric Lindros or whoever else. You want to establish
yourself as a player and as a person,'' Kariya said. ``As a young
player coming in, I felt I had to establish myself on the ice
first. Now I'm a little more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kariya stresses that players ``aren't out there doing The
Gong Show.'' Instead, they're hockey players first and salesmen
second. And as for all that talk about ``The Next One,'' well
that's a group project, as far as Kariya is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of players I'd pay to watch, especially on a
team like Dallas,'' Kariya said. ``Brett Hull, Mike Modano, (Jere)
Lehtinen, (Sergei) Zubov, I think any of those guys are worth
watching. I think all of them are worth watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is a fan has to watch, and watch closely, to
appreciate what each player does.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't basketball, you're not going to have (Michael)
Jordan be incredible every second he's on the floor like in the
NBA,'' Verbeek said. ``Hockey is a different game. Just because
you're the best player who's ever played doesn't necessarily mean
you're going to be the best player on the ice in any particular
game.''
</P>
<P>
   And that means the search for The Next One could be lengthy.
Maybe, the NHL simply has to look back to a time when it was a
league of stars, instead of one star, when Maurice ``Rocket''
Richard and Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay and Elmer Lach and Bernie
``Boom Boom'' Geoffrion all shared the job of selling the league
back in the 1940s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, there might be a player as talented as Wayne Gretzky.
I think there will be,'' Hitchcock said. ``But what's missing is
someone who loves and respects the game as much as he does. He grew
up with outdoor rinks and Saturday morning hockey. The players that
come up now are so much more sophisticated. Television, media
exposure, indoor arenas, all that stuff has changed the game so
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference between Wayne Gretzky and everyone
else,'' Hitchcock said as he pondered who could be The Next One.
``That's the hardest thing to replace.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JARVIS' REBUILDING PASSES A TEST  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Suddenly, the sky is looking to be the limit for
St. John's. A team that was picked to finish fourth in its own
league, a team with a freshman point guard, a first-year coach and
a volatile sophomore star, is headed to the Round of 16 for the
first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought that St. John's was nearly 30 points
better than Indiana's fabled program and its fabled and perhaps
fading coach? Not everyone here, putting statistic against
statistic and myth against myth, thought St. John's stood a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Jarvis has been the model of diplomacy this season,
but on the eve of Saturday's game he showed signs of irritation as
he fielded questions from the national news media. Many of the
questions directed to him had to do with his team's attitude about
going up against big, bad Indiana and Hoosiers Coach Bob Knight.
The Hoosiers have appeared in so many National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournaments, have won three national championships,
have gone undefeated once. Jarvis responded with appropriate
deference. He recalled how he had picked Knight's brain to help get
his own career started.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first coaching clinic I could actually afford to go to was
in 1967 in Framingham, Mass., and it was conducted by Bobby
Knight,'' Jarvis said. ``I bought his book for $1.50 and I learned
the finer points of man-to-man defense. It's five against the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Graciously but firmly, the 52-year-old Jarvis reminded the
audience that St. John's has pretty deep roots itself; that St.
John's, founded in 1870, does not look up at the mountain of
college basketball lore but is an integral part of that mountain.
Knight put Indiana on the map; the St. John's legacy was built by
many coaches. Joe Lapchick and Lou Carnesecca are intertwined, not
merely in college basketball lore, but in the basketball history of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's is the fifth-winningest team in college basketball
history; Indiana is 10th. St. John's has the sixth-best winning
percentage in college basketball, the ninth-most NCAA tournament
appearances. Eight St. John's players are in the Naismith Memorial
Basketball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, 32 years after watching Knight's clinic, Jarvis repaid
the favor as St. John's conducted a clinic for Indiana. The Red
Storm used fundamental, textbook basketball to rout Indiana, 86-61.
The pulverizing blow came midway in the first half when Jarvis
switched from man-to-man to a variation of a zone defense _ and a
zone press _ that stopped Indiana cold. St. John's extended its
lead from 30-23 to 45-30 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a new millennium, Indiana and St. John's are at
opposite junctures. While Knight has become something of a coaching
relic whose standing in the game hinges mostly on what he has
accomplished, Jarvis' time is now.
</P>
<P>
   The great challenge Jarvis faces is how he will continue to
build on the St. John's foundation. How will he forge his special
persona on a program that has a long history but also needs a
transfusion?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, St. John's glory had begun to seem tarnished. St. John's
has never won a national basketball title. The school has not been
to a Final Four since 1985. The program's 26 victories this season
are the most since the 1984-85 season, when St. John's went 31-5.
St. John's victory over Stamford on Thursday was the school's first
NCAA tournament victory since March 1993, when St. John's defeated
Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis doesn't have the luxury of reflecting on tradition when
there is a new one to build. And he knows how difficult it is to
build in the current climate, when outstanding players are likely
to leave after two seasons. Barring a miracle, Ron Artest, St.
John's best player, may leave college after this season for the
National Basketball Association. With Artest back in the lineup
next season, St. John's is a top-five program.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his career, Jarvis is in position to
compete nationally for the best players. But rebuilding can be a
fragile process, subject not only to the whims of teen-agers but
also to the twists and tragedies of life. Jarvis has only to look
at Kentucky and Tubby Smith, who took over that fabled program last
season. He completed a fairy-tale rookie season by leading the
Wildcats to the national championship. He set about rebuilding and
this season enjoyed one of the best recruiting classes in Kentucky
history.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Kentucky received commitments from two of the
nation's top three high school scorers: guard Keith Bogans of
Hyattsville, Md., and John Stewart, a talented 7-footer from
Indianapolis North Lawrence High School.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, 30 minutes before Kentucky played New Mexico
State, Smith received terrible news: Stewart had collapsed and died
during a playoff game against Bloomington South that evening.
</P>
<P>
   With two minutes to play in the third quarter, Stewart, who had
scored 10 straight points, asked to be taken out, complaining of
shortness of breath. Moments after coming out, he crumpled on the
bench. Emergency personnel administered c.p.r. Stewart was put on a
stretcher and taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
After Kentucky's victory over New Mexico State, Smith broke down in
tears.
</P>
<P>
   For Jarvis, Stewart's death illuminates the importance of
savoring the moment, enjoying the day. After Saturday's victory, he
told his team to enjoy the moment. ``The first three letters in
fundamental is fun,'' Jarvis said. ``Nothing is guaranteed about
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But the stakes and expectations are raised, and Jarvis' team is
hungry. ``This group is never going to be satisfied,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Jarvis? Is he satisfied? ``I am very satisfied,
today,'' he said. ``I have a tremendous sense of accomplishment, I
have a tremendous sense of pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the Round of 16 enough? ``It's enough today.''

   (NYT11) NEW YORK -- March 13, 1999 -- NY-RUSSIAN-IMMIGRATION-3,
03-13 -- Among 27 family members who arrived in the Brighton Beach
section of Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1975 from Odessa, a Ukrainian resort
city on the Black Sea, are from left to right, Sofia Vinokurov,
owner of a food store and smoked-fish business called the
International, Lara Akkerman and Bella Rakhman. It has been about
25 years since the first immigrants from the Soviet Union came to
this small neighborhood in Brooklyn. Now, for many of them, it
seems to have become a stepping stone to somewhere else. (Norman Y.

Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, N.Y., portraying stock
characters from Soviet society. It has been about 25 years since
the first immigrants from the Soviet Union came to this small

emigrated from Odessa, a Ukrainian resort city on the Black Sea,
and was part of the first wave of Russian immigrants to arrive in
this small neighborhood in Brooklyn in 1973. ``I used to work all
day in the city,'' says Ms. Garber. ``Then I would come out here to

03-13 -- Denise Werlitz, a 45-year-old insurance representative,
has angered her neighbors in Haverstraw, N.Y., by building a fence
with the ``bad side'' out. The town board has adopted a law that
bars homeowners from installing stockade fences so that the
unfinished side faces the neighbors and the pretty, polished side
faces the house. Outlaws have 30 days to comply or face a $250
fine. ``I feel, if I'm buying it, I should be able to see the nicer
side of it,'' says Werlitz. (Ruby Washington/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT5) BOSTON -- March 13, 1999 -- BOSTON-SCHOOLS-2, 03-13 -- To
some black leaders like Leonard Alkins, president of the Boston
Chapter of the NAACP, Boston appears to be moving toward a system
in which students will be racially separated in schools that are
supposedly equal. They are not sure whether the move is intended to
improve schools or resegregate them. ``It is not in vogue to have
diversity,'' says Alkins. ``Affirmative action and diversity are
being attacked on all levels.'' (Evan Richman/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT4) BOSTON -- March 13, 1999 -- BOSTON-SCHOOLS-1, 03-13 -- In
Boston, the crosstown busing of students like those here at the
Thomas A. Edison School in the Brighton section may be drastically
reduced. In January, Mayor Thomas Menino announced a new effort to
build more schools in minority neighborhoods throughout Boston over
the next six years as part of a plan to allow more students to
attend school nearer their homes and thus reduce the need for
busing. (Evan Richman/New York Times Photo)

Jian, the son of a Chinese farmer, taking part in a Bible class in
Chinatown. At 21, his dream of a college education seems out of
reach. Jian's weekends are spent behind the plexiglass of a Chinese
takeout restaurant in New Jersey with 12-hour shifts paying $70 a
day. Even with the security of asylum, even with a diploma, he says
he will have to postpone college until he can climb his mountain of
debt: the $40,000 that his parents borrowed to have him smuggled to
America. (Nicole Bengiveno/New York Times Photo)

friends back home. But Abdoulaye is luckier than many of his peers.
He lives with relatives in the Bronx and works at the family
business, selling color televisions. He just wasn't prepared for
the loneliness. ``You know, in my country, every time I walk the
street, I was with one of my friends,'' he says. ``Here nobody
talks to me and I don't talk to nobody.'' (Nicole Bengiveno/New

For teen-agers like Monir, of Bangladesh, work and poverty are the
markings of life alone in New York. What drove him from home was
neither poverty nor war, just the sure specter of a dead-end
future. At 15, Monir took flight, in search of an American
education, another life. Now 18 and still struggling through his
sophomore year of high school, Monir works late every night,
packing takeout orders of Thai food. The fear of failure follows
him like a ghost. (Nicole Bengiveno/New York Times Photo)

THE NEXT ONES
ERIC LINDROS Defining moments: 1995 Hart Trophy winner as MVP, but
had a meltdown in 1997 Stanley Cup Finals when Philadelphia was
swept by Detroit. Wayne's World: Lindros has all the tools to be
the next superstar and was originally dubbed ``The Next One.'' But
his pouty refusal to play in Quebec has never been forgotten by
many fans. He's still criticized for not being a leader.
</P>
<P>
   JAROMIR JAGR Defining moments: Helped Pittsbrugh win the Stanley
Cup in 1991 and 1992 and helped Czech Republic win the Olympic gold
medal in 1998. Wayne's World: Jagr has the talent and personality
to be the league's next great salesman. However, he plays for a
financially struggling franchise in Pittsburgh and likely has no
shot at a championship there. A trade to a major media market (New
York, Los Angeles) could vault him to the top.
</P>
<P>
   PAUL KARIYA Defining moments: Is only 24 years old and has three
times been selected the best left winger in the NHL. Wayne's World:
Gretzky was Kariya's hero growing up, and the similarity in their
style is spooky. But Kariya will not be The Next One because he's
uncomfortable with the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   MIKE MODANO Defining moments: Helped Team USA win the 1996 World
Cup and helped the Stars become the NHL's best regular-season team
last season and this season. Wayne's World: Modano is everything
the NHL needs: good-looking, well-spoken, fun to watch. However, he
would just as soon be playing golf, and it's tough to sell that.
</P>
<P>
   TEEMU SELANNE Defining moments: Scored 76 goals in his rookie
season, an NHL record. His trade from Winnipeg Jets to the Mighty
Ducks of Anaheim in 1996 made him Southern California's top hockey
salesman. Wayne's World: Selanne is to Kariya what Ted Lindsay was
to Gordie Howe. Selanne might be better than his partner at times,
but he'll never get the same recognition.

LOS ANGELES: in front of younger teens.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It worked. The movie earned $13 million in its opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any surprise that young kids are getting
into these movies,'' said Larry Kasanoff, chairman of the digital
media group Threshold Entertainment and producer of the ``Mortal
Kombat'' movies and James Cameron's R-rated ``Terminator 2'' and
``True Lies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember seeing kids skateboard right up to the ticket
counter when `Terminator 2' opened and getting right in. Teen-agers
have been doing this since time began. I remember sneaking into
`Emmanuelle' when I was 13, and it didn't kill me. I turned out
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, even the amorous Emmanuelle might blush when
confronted with the adolescent activities in teen movies.
</P>
<P>
   It all leads up to May 28 and ``American Pie,'' although ``South
Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut'' in June promises to take bad taste
to unimaginable heights as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't make a `South Park' movie if it couldn't be rated
R,'' said Trey Parker, who writes and directs the show with partner
Matt Stone. ``What would be the point? The same was true for
`BASEketball.' Otherwise, it would have been just another Pauly
Shore movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Added ``American Pie'' producer Zide: ``If you look back and
remember the most outrageous events of your high school years, they
weren't rated PG. So if you're going to make one of these movies
and you want any kind of credibility with your audience, you have
to get an R-rating.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, studios have been reluctant to allow teen movies
an R rating. Horror films constitute an obvious exception, since
there are few discreet ways to disembowel a human being. But with
other teen genres, studio executives have typically pushed for a
PG-13 rating in order to snare the widest audience.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that thinking has changed, and the success of last
summer's gross-and-grosser comedy ``There's Something About Mary''
has only hastened the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as much a case of diversity as anything else,'' said
Michael Costigan, senior vice president of feature production at
Columbia Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a divide between the 14- and 15-year-olds
and, say, the 17- and 18-year-old audience, and what we're trying
to do is find movies that appeal to both. To do that, you probably
have to make them a little edgier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about teen-agers,'' Costigan said, ``is that they're
probably the most sophisticated audience you have going to movies.
If they see something they don't think is true, they turn off
immediately and you lose them. So you need a feeling of real life
in these movies.''
</P>
<P>
   And real life, or at least the kind being observed and portrayed
by Hollywood screenwriters, has become a more sexually charged and
explicit place for young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's what's really going on, to be honest,'' said
``Cruel Intentions'' producer Neal Moritz. ``The world our movie
depicts is strange and new to a lot of people. But I think that the
games and the peer pressure and the manipulation is what's
happening among young people today.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Kumble agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know parents are going to be upset, but I think they'd be
surprised to find what teen-agers are really up to,'' he said.
``One magazine article that blew my mind from a couple of years ago
was called `Sex and the High School Girl,' which was so shocking
about what kids are up to today. Kids were far worse in that
article than they are in `Cruel Intentions.' Far, far worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's translation: If the worst thing YOUR kids are doing
is sneaking into R-rated movies, relax. You've got it easy.

NFL owners tackle instant replay plan
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PHOENIX _ While Houston and Los Angeles are eager to find out which
city is going to get the 32nd expansion franchise at the NFL spring
meetings this week, the rest of the nation's fans are more
concerned about the likely return of instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion, instant replay, the Thanksgiving Day games, unsettled
ownership situations in Washington and San Francisco, and a
possible change of the kickoff rule are issues on the docket for
meetings that begin today and end Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Instant replay was used from 1986-91, and a new two-plus-two
system is probably going to be approved for two reasons:
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue wants replay, and he usually gets what
he wants. And the competition committee voted 7-1 to recommend the
new system to the owners this week.
</P>
<P>
   What the league is calling the ``two-plus-two'' system allows
coaches to challenge calls two times per game and calls for an
unlimited review of disputed plays in the last two minutes of the
first and second half and overtime _ even if the teams have used
their allotted challenges.
</P>
<P>
   All decisions will be made by the referee using a sideline
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The coach-challenge part says that if the call isn't overturned,
the team will be charged with a timeout. If the call is overturned,
the team doesn't lose a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two minutes of each half and overtime, a replay
official in a booth on the press-box level can stop play and ask
the referee to review it. There is no limit on how many times the
replay official upstairs can ask for a review as long as it's in
the last two minutes of each half and overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Replay must get 24 of the 31 votes to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Several teams that have voted against replay because they didn't
approve of the system proposed at the time are going to change
their vote. Cincinnati owner Mike Brown was the only member of the
competition committee to vote against the current proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh coach Bill Cowher, a member of the competition
committee, likes the proposal that will be presented to the owners
this week. Having a replay official upstairs to call for reviews in
the last two minutes of each half and overtime is the element that
should convince some teams to change their vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for it,'' Cowher says. ``I think two-plus-two has a good
chance of passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about this system, it won't allow enough stoppages
to slow down the pace of the game because you're only going to be
involved with a limited amount of use based on the challenges and
just two minutes each half.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the old system caused long delays while the replay
official in the booth made all the decisions, it was voted down
17-11 in 1992. It was voted down 20-10 and 21-9 the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh, San Diego, Buffalo, Tampa Bay and the New York
Giants are former opponents who are expected to vote yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear all about this new technology and everything,'' says
Giants owner Wellington Mara, who has never voted in favor of
replay. ``If I'm convinced that they've done something to correct
the faults we had before, there's a chance I would vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have an open mind. After I see what the technology is,
then I'll decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL says that under the old replay system, 77 out of about
37,000 plays would have been reversed last season. Under the system
that's being proposed, 40 plays would have been reversed. The
league says that in the playoffs, only one of 1,750 plays in 11
games would have been reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, we get killed (by the media) on these plays,
when, in fact, we're right,'' says Jerry Seeman, the league's
director of officiating. ``Any plays last season with any real
controversy, you can count on with two hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a shame that these came near the ends of games, and
that's why I think you're seeing a lot of the criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Also this week, the owners are expected to review the
controversial ownership situation in San Francisco, where Eddie
DeBartolo Jr. has been declared persona non grata by the league and
his sister, Denis DeBartolo York, who is running the franchise in
his absence because of legal problems in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The owners also may vote on Howard Milstein and Daniel Snyder as
owners of the Redskins. They bid $800 million for the franchise and
Jack Kent Cooke Stadium. Milstein, in particular, is being heavily
investigated by the league.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners want Cooke's son, John Kent Cooke, to remain as the
team president. He has been in control of the franchise and will
continue to be until the owners vote on Milstein and Snyder. If
they are not approved, they will file a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   As for the possible change in the kickoff rule, the proposal
calls for the receiving team to get the ball at its 25 rather than
its 20 if the kickoff goes out of the end zone. The idea behind
this proposal is for the kicker to put the ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one of the league's traditions _ the Thanksgiving Day
games at Detroit and Dallas _ is being challenged. Several owners,
led by Kansas City's Lamar Hunt and New Orleans' Tom Benson, want
to rotate the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions have hosted the game since 1934 and the Cowboys since
1966. Owners William Clay Ford and Jerry Jones are lobbying hard
against any changes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Ford used his influence to to kill the same proposal
before it came to a vote. He was backed by the Big Three automakers
that spend millions to advertise on NFL telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ambush,'' Ford says. ``Once again, it's a total
disregard of the fans. Once again, it's a total disregard of
tradition. To heck with communities. To heck with tradition. To
heck with families. It's a real slap in the face of the Detroit
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is everything that's wrong with pro sports _
greed, lack of tradition, and lack of caring for the fans. It
sounds to me like the commissioner is behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tagliabue is, indeed, behind it, don't be surprised if the
owners vote to rotate the Thanksgiving Day games.

STUDIOS BANK ON TEENS GETTING INTO R-RATED FILMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Los Angeles Daily News film writer Bob Strauss contributed to this
story) 
(EDITORS: This story is moving in the ``e'' entertainment news
file, the ``a'' national news file and in the ``n'' California news
file.) 
BY GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Teen-ager Denise Jones knows she isn't supposed to
see the movie ``Cruel Intentions.'' She's 16, it's rated R, and her
parents ``more or less'' barred her from attending.
</P>
<P>
   She went anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I LOVE Sarah Michelle Gellar, and there's no way I was going
to miss her big movie,'' Denise said recently outside a theater in
Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. ``So I went last Friday with some
friends and we all bought tickets and nobody asked any questions.
Not even my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   For young teens, R-rated movies (restricted for those under 17
without an adult because of sex, violence or language) are hotter
and more plentiful _ and easier to get into _ than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, in the past, we've seen randy adolescents in movies like
``Porky's'' and ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High.'' What makes the
current era of teen steam different is the sheer number of films.
There were 16 R-rated teen films in 1998. There have already been
five this year, and the next six weeks will bring five more.
</P>
<P>
   So far we've seen a blond cheerleader wearing a whipped-cream
ensemble (and nothing else) in ``Varsity Blues'' and heard
explicitly raw sex talk in the current hit ``Cruel Intentions.''
Those two movies are just the warm-up act.
</P>
<P>
   The film most teen-agers are holding their breath for right now
is called ``American Pie,'' and it won't be playing in theaters
until May. It's about four high school seniors who vow to lose
their virginity by prom night and includes a scene that's so gross
that it's bound to delight many teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we've made this generation's `Porky's,''' said the
film's producer Warren Zide without a trace of remorse or shame in
his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie is a little deeper than you'd imagine, but that
will probably be lost on most since we push the envelope further
than any teen movie in recent memory.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hollywood drools at the prospect of all those teen
dollars, most theater chains do have specific policies regarding
R-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   Both AMC and Pacific Theatres instruct box-office employees to
ask for identification when selling tickets to teens. Ushers are
sometimes positioned at theater entrances to check ticket stubs and
make sure teens are going into the right movie.
</P>
<P>
   But with multiplexes often having 16 to 20 screens, managers
sometimes run into a numbers crunch with their employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really try to have someone at the door for at least the
first weekend,'' said Victor Marquez, Pacific's Winnetka
All-Stadium 20 multiplex assistant manager.
</P>
<P>
   Adds AMC spokeswoman Brenda Nolte: ``It's definitely more of a
challenge these days. We do try.''
</P>
<P>
   The results are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go into any theater playing an R-rated movie on a Friday
night, and I bet half the audience is 14 or 15 years old,'' said
17-year Mike Thompson of Los Angeles. ``It's just not that big a
deal anymore. Nobody seems to be sweating it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent screening of ``Cruel Intentions'' at a theater in
the Chatsworth community of the San Fernando Valley, half the
audience appeared to be under 17. Of course, there was no way to
know their age for sure, and theater managers say that's part of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a question, we ask for identification when they
purchase a ticket, but it's often hard to know when to ask,''
Marquez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do turn down a lot of kids, but a lot of them come and have
their parents buy the tickets for them. Then the parents leave.
Once they have the ticket, there's not a whole lot we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the methods teens use to foil the system: Buy a ticket to
a different movie playing at the same time, make friends with the
person selling the tickets or ask a parent to buy a ticket for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of parents doing that,'' Marquez said. ``Most of
them don't want to see the movies with their kids. They're just not
`parent' kinds of movies. They drop them off and come back later.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers have been betting on the kids' ability to see their
films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel Intentions'' director Roger Kumble admitted he was
banking on underage kids seeing his movie, adding that the casting
of popular television actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, star of
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' was like ``dangling the carrot'' in
front of younger teens.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   X X X  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It worked. The movie earned $13 million in its opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any surprise that young kids are getting
into these movies,'' said Larry Kasanoff, chairman of the digital
media group Threshold Entertainment and producer of the ``Mortal
Kombat'' movies and James Cameron's R-rated ``Terminator 2'' and
``True Lies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember seeing kids skateboard right up to the ticket
counter when `Terminator 2' opened and getting right in. Teen-agers
have been doing this since time began. I remember sneaking into
`Emmanuelle' when I was 13, and it didn't kill me. I turned out
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, even the amorous Emmanuelle might blush when
confronted with the adolescent activities in teen movies.
</P>
<P>
   It all leads up to May 28 and ``American Pie,'' although ``South
Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut'' in June promises to take bad taste
to unimaginable heights as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't make a `South Park' movie if it couldn't be rated
R,'' said Trey Parker, who writes and directs the show with partner
Matt Stone. ``What would be the point? The same was true for
`BASEketball.' Otherwise, it would have been just another Pauly
Shore movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Added ``American Pie'' producer Zide: ``If you look back and
remember the most outrageous events of your high school years, they
weren't rated PG. So if you're going to make one of these movies
and you want any kind of credibility with your audience, you have
to get an R-rating.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, studios have been reluctant to allow teen movies
an R rating. Horror films constitute an obvious exception, since
there are few discreet ways to disembowel a human being. But with
other teen genres, studio executives have typically pushed for a
PG-13 rating in order to snare the widest audience.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that thinking has changed, and the success of last
summer's gross-and-grosser comedy ``There's Something About Mary''
has only hastened the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as much a case of diversity as anything else,'' said
Michael Costigan, senior vice president of feature production at
Columbia Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a divide between the 14- and 15-year-olds
and, say, the 17- and 18-year-old audience, and what we're trying
to do is find movies that appeal to both. To do that, you probably
have to make them a little edgier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about teen-agers,'' Costigan said, ``is that they're
probably the most sophisticated audience you have going to movies.
If they see something they don't think is true, they turn off
immediately and you lose them. So you need a feeling of real life
in these movies.''
</P>
<P>
   And real life, or at least the kind being observed and portrayed
by Hollywood screenwriters, has become a more sexually charged and
explicit place for young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's what's really going on, to be honest,'' said
``Cruel Intentions'' producer Neal Moritz. ``The world our movie
depicts is strange and new to a lot of people. But I think that the
games and the peer pressure and the manipulation is what's
happening among young people today.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Kumble agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know parents are going to be upset, but I think they'd be
surprised to find what teen-agers are really up to,'' he said.
``One magazine article that blew my mind from a couple of years ago
was called `Sex and the High School Girl,' which was so shocking
about what kids are up to today. Kids were far worse in that
article than they are in `Cruel Intentions.' Far, far worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's translation: If the worst thing YOUR kids are doing
is sneaking into R-rated movies, relax. You've got it easy.

BY GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Teen-ager Denise Jones knows she isn't supposed to
see the movie ``Cruel Intentions.'' She's 16, it's rated R, and her
parents ``more or less'' barred her from attending.
</P>
<P>
   She went anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I LOVE Sarah Michelle Gellar, and there's no way I was going
to miss her big movie,'' Denise said recently outside a theater in
Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. ``So I went last Friday with some
friends and we all bought tickets and nobody asked any questions.
Not even my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   For young teens, R-rated movies (restricted for those under 17
without an adult because of sex, violence or language) are hotter
and more plentiful _ and easier to get into _ than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, in the past, we've seen randy adolescents in movies like
``Porky's'' and ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High.'' What makes the
current era of teen steam different is the sheer number of films.
There were 16 R-rated teen films in 1998. There have already been
five this year, and the next six weeks will bring five more.
</P>
<P>
   So far we've seen a blond cheerleader wearing a whipped-cream
ensemble (and nothing else) in ``Varsity Blues'' and heard
explicitly raw sex talk in the current hit ``Cruel Intentions.''
Those two movies are just the warm-up act.
</P>
<P>
   The film most teen-agers are holding their breath for right now
is called ``American Pie,'' and it won't be playing in theaters
until May. It's about four high school seniors who vow to lose
their virginity by prom night and includes a scene that's so gross
that it's bound to delight many teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we've made this generation's `Porky's,''' said the
film's producer Warren Zide without a trace of remorse or shame in
his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie is a little deeper than you'd imagine, but that
will probably be lost on most since we push the envelope further
than any teen movie in recent memory.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hollywood drools at the prospect of all those teen
dollars, most theater chains do have specific policies regarding
R-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   Both AMC and Pacific Theatres instruct box-office employees to
ask for identification when selling tickets to teens. Ushers are
sometimes positioned at theater entrances to check ticket stubs and
make sure teens are going into the right movie.
</P>
<P>
   But with multiplexes often having 16 to 20 screens, managers
sometimes run into a numbers crunch with their employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really try to have someone at the door for at least the
first weekend,'' said Victor Marquez, Pacific's Winnetka
All-Stadium 20 multiplex assistant manager.
</P>
<P>
   Adds AMC spokeswoman Brenda Nolte: ``It's definitely more of a
challenge these days. We do try.''
</P>
<P>
   The results are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go into any theater playing an R-rated movie on a Friday
night, and I bet half the audience is 14 or 15 years old,'' said
17-year Mike Thompson of Los Angeles. ``It's just not that big a
deal anymore. Nobody seems to be sweating it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent screening of ``Cruel Intentions'' at a theater in
the Chatsworth community of the San Fernando Valley, half the
audience appeared to be under 17. Of course, there was no way to
know their age for sure, and theater managers say that's part of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a question, we ask for identification when they
purchase a ticket, but it's often hard to know when to ask,''
Marquez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do turn down a lot of kids, but a lot of them come and have
their parents buy the tickets for them. Then the parents leave.
Once they have the ticket, there's not a whole lot we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the methods teens use to foil the system: Buy a ticket to
a different movie playing at the same time, make friends with the
person selling the tickets or ask a parent to buy a ticket for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of parents doing that,'' Marquez said. ``Most of
them don't want to see the movies with their kids. They're just not
`parent' kinds of movies. They drop them off and come back later.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers have been betting on the kids' ability to see their
films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel Intentions'' director Roger Kumble admitted he was
banking on underage kids seeing his movie, adding that the casting
of popular television actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, star of
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' was like ``dangling the carrot'' in
front of younger teens.

AUBURN BEATS OKLAHOMA STATE, 81-74  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Auburn, the best team in the Southeastern
Conference during the regular season, is noted for its overall
athleticism, its 20 offensive rebounds per game and its trapping
defensive pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But when the top-seeded team in the South Regional was unable to
shake Oklahoma State on Saturday, it turned to the most unassuming
of Tigers, the slender sophomore guard Scott Pohlman. His
career-best 28 points proved the difference as Auburn defeated the
ninth-seeded Cowboys, 81-74.
</P>
<P>
   The victory advanced Auburn (29-3) to Thursday's regional
semifinal in Knoxville, Tenn. The nation's fourth-ranked team will
face the winner of tonight's game between fourth-seeded Ohio State
and 12th-seeded Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State (23-11) twice pulled within 2 points in the final
1 minute 21 seconds, but couldn't catch the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a boxing match,'' said Auburn Coach Cliff Ellis.
``They just wouldn't wilt. They wouldn't go away. We gave them the
one-two-three punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way for Auburn was Pohlman, a 160-pound guard from
the Atlanta suburbs who has floppy, light brown hair and is
nicknamed Opie, after the character from the old Andy Griffith
television show.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn held a 37-33 lead at halftime and pushed its lead to 10
points with 6:08 remaining on a jumper by Pohlman, who was 11 of 17
shooting in the game. But behind the inside scoring of forward
Desmond Mason and the perimeter shooting of guard Adrian Peterson,
Oklahoma State pulled within four, 73-69, with 1:52 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson (27 points) made a 3-pointer and a long jumper during
the burst. Mason (26 points and 9 rebounds) added three inside
baskets and a free throw as he outplayed forward Chris Porter, the
SEC player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peterson put on a show,'' Ellis said. ``Mason was right there
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Cowboys closing in, Porter was fouled and made 1 of 2
free throws to push the lead back to 5. Joe Adkins responded with a
long 3-pointer for Oklahoma State, and with 1:21 left the Auburn
lead was down to 74-72.
</P>
<P>
   On the Tigers' next possession, Pohlman leaned into Brian
Montonati, the 220-pound Cowboys forward, sending him sprawling.
With a clear view of the basket, Pohlman sank a jumper in the lane
and Auburn led by four with 51.9 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it was,'' Pohlman said of his scoring. ``I
was just getting good looks at it. I can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter's inadvertent tip-in of an errant 3-pointer by the
Cowboys cut the lead to 76-74 with 34.2 seconds left, but Auburn
made 5 of 6 free throws in the final 29 seconds to preserve its
victory.
</P>
<P>
   There were seven lead changes in the game's first seven minutes.
The Cowboys emerged from the initial flurry to build their largest
lead of the game, 18-12, on a 3-pointer by Adkins at the 11:08
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State was able to hold its own on the boards in the
first half, fighting to a 21-21 draw against a Tigers squad that
enjoyed the nation's fourth-best rebound margin. For the game,
Auburn held a 35-29 rebounding edge.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's defensive pressure took its toll on Oklahoma St. in the
first half. The Cowboys, an at-large entrant from the Big 12,
committed a dozen turnovers in the half, one fewer than its
per-game average.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Oklahoma State could not contain Pohlman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those guys who doesn't look like he's going to sit
there and bite you, but he does,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Pohlman scored 11 unanswered points in a span of less than three
and a half minutes, the last on a layup off an inbounds pass, to
put Auburn into the lead for good, 30-21, with 4 minutes 43 seconds
left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn, making its first NCAA appearance since 1988, has not
been in many close games this season, giving rise to doubts about
its toughness. The Tigers _ only the ninth team to become a No.
1-seeded team a year after failing to reach the tournament _
answered those doubts, at least for now. Of the previous eight,
three reached the Final Four, most recently Minnesota in 1997.

GONZAGA BEATS STANFORD, 82-74  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEN GURNICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Tiny Gonzaga University joined the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament's tradition of giant-killers
Saturday by shocking second-seeded Stanford University, 82-74, in
the second round of the West Region at Key Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The victory made 10th-seeded Gonzaga, a school of 4,500 students
in Spokane, Wash., one of the 16 finalists for the college
championship, heady territory for a school that was known mainly in
basketball circles only as the school that produced the Utah Jazz
star John Stockton in the mid-1980s. Now, though, it joins such
teams as Valparaiso, Cleveland State, Ball State and
Tennessee-Chattanooga as schools that have burst into national
attention after playing on the fringes of big-time college
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford _ which made it to the Final Four last season, was the
Pac-10 champion this year and was a preseason choice for the
national title by several publications _ scored the first point of
the game on a free throw and never led again.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga had never won an NCAA tournament game until this past
week, but Coach Dan Monson insisted: ``This is not a fluke
situation. We knew we were good enough to do it. Our kids believed
they were going to win that game. Obviously it puts us in the
spotlight, but this has been a good program for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga reached this game by beating the depleted University of
Minnesota, 75-63, on Thursday, the biggest previous victory in
Gonzaga's history. But it was a victory tarnished by game-day
suspensions of four Minnesota players in an academic fraud scandal.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing to tarnish Gonzaga's upset of Stanford. The
Bulldogs, the West Coast Conference champion, who were on a mission
for respect after being bypassed for the tournament last year with
24 victories, won with athleticism and courage, not intimidated by
the bigger, stronger and highly regarded Stanford. Gonzaga went toe
to toe with Stanford inside, outrebounding the Cardinal, 47-33.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be here since last year,'' said guard Matt
Santangelo, who led the Bulldogs with 22 points, 14 in the second
half. ``If we didn't play this way, I'd be embarrassed now.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Richie Frahm added 15 points for Gonzaga and guard Quentin
Hall had 14.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Arthur Lee had a game-high 24 points to lead
Stanford. Kris Weems added 18 points. He hit four 3-point jumpers,
including three in the final two minutes to keep Stanford close.
Mark Madsen had 15 points and a game-high 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   For the game, Stanford hit only 39 percent from the field and
Gonzaga only 40 percent, but the Bulldogs drained 11 3-pointers
compared with five for the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   Monson, Gonzaga's second-year coach and the son of the longtime
University of Idaho and University of Oregon coach Dan Monson, will
lead the Bulldogs against the winner of the Florida-Weber State
game Thursday in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred on by a virtual home-court advantage with a large
contingent of fans who made the 300-mile drive from Spokane, the
Bulldogs trailed only in the opening minute, 1-0. Stanford tied the
score at 49-49 with 11 minutes 18 seconds left, but Gonzaga
answered with a 20-10 run to rebuild its lead.
</P>
<P>
   At the start, Gonzaga defied expectations and went to work
inside against the Cardinal's big men, scoring no points but
clearing room for Casey Calvary to hit his first two 3-pointers.
Less than five minutes into the game, the Bulldogs' lead was 5 when
Calvary took a lob from Santangelo and slammed it home.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Gonzaga knew the big Cardinal would work inside to
use its height advantage, but the Bulldogs held their ground and
even outrebounded Stanford in the first half, 20-17. When close
Stanford shots did not fall, the smaller Bulldogs hit the boards
and won the early transition game. With five 3-point shots, they
led by 13 after nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford answered with a 12-3 run and cut the lead to 26-22, 6
of the points coming on free throws as Gonzaga's pesky defense
inside also resulted in foul trouble. The Cardinal was lucky to
trail by only 4 at halftime, scoring at the buzzer on a Peter Sauer
layin after a Gonzaga turnover with five seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   With Lee taking over, Stanford slowly went to work on that lead,
and finally caught Gonzaga, 49-49, on two Lee free throws. But
Gonzaga would not fold and led, 69-59, when Weems nailed a
3-pointer with 1:28 remaining. Calvary hit one of two free throws,
but Lee brought Stanford back with an uncontested dribble-drive
layin, and the lead was 70-64. Gonzaga broke a full-court press for
a breakaway layin by Frahm, but Stanford then got a pair of free
throws from Lee after a foul by Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Frahm restored the lead to 8 points with two free throws, but
Weems cut it to 5 with another 3-pointer. In the waning moments,
Stanford never got closer.

FINLEY READY TO FIRE AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ His opening-day start is still a question, but
Angels pitcher Chuck Finley says he'll be ready to take his turn in
the rotation once the season begins.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who has not pitched in a Cactus League game this spring
because of a muscle strain in his upper back and neck, threw off
the mound Saturday for the first time in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   All went well, and he plans to start Tuesday's game against the
Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan on taking my turn from here on out,'' Finley said. ``I
don't know how my pitch count will fall as far as (being ready by)
opening day. Opening day is a special day, but I've got to
understand the fact there are 35 starts in there for me and I've
got to be able to make every one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the other Angels starter have each made two starts
and are up to a pitch-count of about 60, Finley says he isn't that
far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been inactive,'' Finley said. ``It's not like
they're just taking me out of the wrapper. I've been throwing, just
not off the hill. I'll go out and just get a feel for it, get my
work in.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's 10-minute stint on the mound Saturday convinced him
he's over the stiffness he experiences every spring.
</P>
<P>
   Other ailments: Infielder Justin Baughman is in town to see team
orthopedist Dr. Lewis Yocum. Baughman is recovering from multiple
fractures in his left leg suffered Nov. 7 in the Mexican Winter
League, but it is taking longer than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going very, very slow,'' Baughman said. ``We're going to
discuss other alternatives. They said it would be four to six
months, but it was four months last week. And I don't think it'll
be ready by six months. Yeah, it's very disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the other alternatives is a second surgery (the first was
Nov. 11), which would put Baughman out for the entire season. Yocum
said a decision should be made by this week.
</P>
<P>
   Any questions about Tim Salmon's left foot have been answered,
and never more so than Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Salmon raced to the right-field line to cut
off a ball hit by Mickey Morandini, holding him to a single. In the
sixth, Salmon flew around the bases with an RBI triple.
</P>
<P>
   No Sammy: The 7,411 fans at Tempe Diablo Stadium on Saturday
represented the largest crowd of the spring at the Angels'
ballpark, and it had a lot to do with the anticipated appearance of
the visiting Chicago Cubs and Sammy Sosa. Just one problem _ the
Cubs played a split-squad game in Peoria against the Padres on
Saturday night, and Sosa was scheduled to play there.
</P>
<P>
   The other draw was Cubs starter Kerry Wood, who made his first
spring appearance. Wood gave up three runs (all earned) and three
hits in 11/3 innings in the Angels' 6-5 win. The Angels improved to
3-6 in Cactus League play.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Ken Hill, who gave up two runs (none earned) and
four hits in 22/3 innings, says his surgically repaired elbow feels
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been two years since I've felt this good,'' Hill said.
``I'll just pray, knock on wood, that I stay healthy all year. If I
stay healthy, I can help this ballclub. I know they're counting on
me.''

AMWEST _ A pay dispute between flight attendants and America West
Airlines, smoldering since the company's 1991 financial meltdown,
has left negotiators with little time to defuse the animosity and
work out a deal before Friday's strike deadline. Though there have
been signs of hope for a settlement, the 2,400 flight attendants
are toting some heavy baggage born of America West's bankruptcy
filing seven years ago. The Tempe-based carrier cut their pay 10
percent and left them holding worthless stock in its reorganization
_ stock that the flight attendants were forced to buy with salaries
as little as $12,000 a year. By PETER CORBETT. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL;

FAMILY FEUDS HEAT UP IN NBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There might not be an All-Star Game, but another NBA tradition
has survived in this post-lockout season.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, after a brief honeymoon, player-coach feuds are beginning
to heat up from the Pacific Northwest to the Sunshine State. And
that's just in the past seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at some of the current matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson vs. Larry Brown: Wait a minute, isn't Iverson
leading the league in scoring? Yes, but Brown is still troubled
with his star, claiming he is reverting to his old ways since being
named player of the month in February.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson has missed two practices in the past week, having his
bodyguard call the Sixers the first time and then not phoning at
all the second absence. It's beginning to wear thin on Brown, who
has privately called Iverson a phony, and is tired of his theatrics
and aversion to playing defense.
</P>
<P>
   This one could last awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway vs. Chuck Daly: All is not well in Orlando? Oh
really? The ever-sensitive Penny, who is shooting 39.8 percent from
the field, is complaining that the coaching staff doesn't
appreciate how many double-teams he's facing so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a guy who tries to create for everyone else,'' said
Penny, after taking 28 shots against San Antonio and Atlanta, then
settling for nine against Dallas. ``I only shot nine times (against
Dallas) so it wasn't like I had a really bad night. I want to get
the ball up 20 or 22 times a game, but I'm not able to do that
right now. We're struggling. The coaches are going to have to come
up with some more creative ways to get me shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Did we mention Penny is a free agent after the season?
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker vs. Paul Westphal: A team player at odds with a
players' coach? Are the Sonics sleepless in Seattle or what?
</P>
<P>
   Baker was livid that Westphal benched him for the final eight
minutes of the Sonics' loss to the Bucks (and ex-coach George Karl)
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what Paul Westphal is thinking right now
as far as playing me. It doesn't help when you're not playing well
and not getting a lot of minutes,'' Baker said. ``The only way I'm
going to be productive is being on the floor. I'm still capable of
helping this basketball team win games, and that's the bottom line.
He might feel differently, but he hasn't expressed that to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Westphal never met a player he didn't want to please, the
pair quickly had a heart-to-heart talk, with Baker telling Westphal
an All-Star shouldn't sit so much in the fourth quarter and
Westphal telling Baker to play like an All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle's next game against Chicago, Baker played 42 minutes
and scored 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Look, I'm an All-Star, I want to be in the game in
the fourth quarter,''' Westphal said, referring to their meeting.
``And he backed up his words.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade talk: Remember when a team made a trade to better itself?
</P>
<P>
   NBA trades are rarely that simple anymore, and lately, it seems
as if every deal is finalized just so a team can make sure it
doesn't lose a star player to free agency without some form of
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Minnesota breaks up close friends Kevin Garnett and
Stephon Marbury and alters the heart of the franchise by shipping
free-agent-to-be Marbury to New Jersey. Or Milwaukee ships Terrell
Brandon to Minnesota, sure that he will never re-sign with the
Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks received point guard Sam Cassell in return, who is not
the caliber of Brandon, but is locked up in a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea if it was the right move or the wrong move,''
Bucks coach Karl said. ``I think we made a basketball decision
based on people basically wanting to be in Milwaukee. I don't think
you can be successful building a team without committed athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need commitment and players who will talk about it, and
have a desire and a passion and an anger for it. The professional
NBA (expletive), that game we've got to restructure around players
who are serious and committed. That's my feeling. I think we let
too many players blackmail us in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Where's the beef? The Bulls' marketing department set up a
contest in which fans in attendance, when the Bulls score 100
points and win, get a free taco from Taco Bell. Last year, the
Bulls had to score 110 points to reach Taco Time, but times being
what they are...
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls finally reached 100 points for the first time Tuesday
against New Jersey and won the game. Brent Barry, the former
Clipper, missed a free throw that would have given the Bulls their
100th point, but Toni Kukoc got it later in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of pressure, having to feed 23,000 Chicagoans,''
Barry said. ``When I missed, I thought I heard someone say `Go to
hell' but what they were saying was `Taco Bell.' I never got booed
while we were up 17 points and I was missing a free throw,'' Barry
said. ``In L.A. if we scored 70 points, every fan got a free car.
Of course, there were only six free cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Help wanted: The Lakers didn't want B.J. Armstrong, but that
doesn't mean he's short of options. Expect the point guard to sign
with Seattle or Detroit early next week. &QL;

 &HT;    Probe of freighter's role in Haitians' drownings sought
 &HT;    By Larry Hobbs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Coast Guard officals wonder if the crew
of a Maltese freighter could have done more to rescue the victims
of a deadly Haitian immigrant smuggling disaster off West Palm
Beach last week.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Adm. Norman T. Saunders is asking for an
investigation by the government of Malta, the country where the
ship Tomis Faith is registered, petty officer Scott Carr said. The
Coast Guard rescued three men and confirmed four women dead after
Tomis Faith crew members contacted it at about 1 a.m. on March 6
and said they heard screams coming from the water.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Border Patrol officials believe anywhere from 15 to 43
people drowned when at least one, and possibly two boats sank 26
miles offshore. Details remain sketchy because of conflicting
accounts from the survivors, Border Patrol agents said.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing screams, the crew of the Tomis Faith shined a
light into the water, but saw nothing, Scott said. They continued
on and later reported the incident to the Coast Guard via telex,
Scott said. The telex went to the Coast Guard's communications
center in Virginia, and was then passed on to the Coast Guard
station in Miami, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Saunders wonders if the crew violated international
maritime laws by not remaining in the area until a search and
rescue crew arrived, or by not calling the Coast Guard immediately
on its radio, Carr said. Because the incident took place in
international waters, it is up to the ship's registered country to
conduct an investigation, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   About three weeks ago, Tomis Faith left its port in New Orleans
against orders to remain because of problems with the boat, Scott
said. The ship is en route to Spain, he said.

GARSON KANIN, 86, PLAYWRIGHT AND DIRECTOR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARILYN BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Garson Kanin, who broke into show business as a
saxophone-playing high school dropout and went on to write ``Born
Yesterday,'' direct ``The Diary of Anne Frank'' and become the
co-writer of two classic Tracy-Hepburn movies, died on Saturday at
his home in Manhattan. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   He died after a lengthy illness, according to a spokeswoman for
the family. His wife, the actress Marian Seldes, whom he married in
1990, was with him.
</P>
<P>
   In a life filled with work _ ``I become physically ill if I
don't work for three days,'' he once said _ Kanin wrote or directed
32 plays, acted in 8, worked on 29 films and wrote more than a
dozen books of fiction and nonfiction, as well as hundreds of short
stories and articles that were translated into numerous languages.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his life, Kanin and his first wife, the actress Ruth
Gordon, were a team. They were feisty, argumentative collaborators
as playwrights and strikingly close as man and wife for 43 years.
They became something of a fixture at the Russian Tea Room _ first
booth on the left _ where they had lunch together almost every day.
After Miss Gordon died in 1985, he said: ``I'm half dead. If you
understand what it's like to be a team, with Ruth no longer here I
feel half alive, that's all. I don't feel completely with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanin and Miss Gordon wrote five films together, including
``Adam's Rib'' (1949) and ``Pat and Mike'' (1952), both of which
starred Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. But the chemistry that
worked so well for the two stars did not rub off on Kanin and Miss
Gordon, at least not at first. Although Kanin said they never had a
single domestic quarrel, ``the battles at work were horrendous.''
Their first joint screenplay was such a hit, however, that
Hollywood wanted more of the same. ``We were trapped by success,''
Kanin said. ``The studio wanted us to write together or not at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanin, a compact, restless man of almost ascetic thinness who
nevertheless loved good food, was that rare combination of great
raconteur and intent listener. Born in Rochester, N.Y., on Nov. 24,
1912, he moved with his family to Detroit and finally to New York
City. He made his way onto the stage as an actor after dropping out
of James Madison High School in Brooklyn and trying to make a
living as a saxophonist and leader of a band, Garson Kay and his
Red Peppers. He then attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts
and in 1933 landed a role in a play about a reform school called
``Little Ol' Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, he heard there was an opening in a George Abbott play,
``Ladies' Money,'' for an actor with red hair. He borrowed money
from a friend, the actor Sam Levene, to have his hair dyed and
showed up for the audition. Abbott wrote in his autobiography that
``an actor turned up who was just right for the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so bright and so imaginative that I took to him
immediately,'' he wrote. ``His name was Garson Kanin, and he was to
be my right-hand man for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I insinuated myself on him,'' Kanin said of Abbott, who was
already a Broadway legend. I knew he was an ace and I knew I had
everything to learn from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanin, who was making $60 a week for his role in the play, got
an additional $25 a week to work in the office, and was soon put in
charge of directing the road companies of Abbott shows. He was also
made a casting director, and was able to find roles for Jose
Ferrer, Eddie Albert, Betty Field, Ezra Stone, Everett Sloane and
others.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright Thornton Wilder became another mentor. Kanin said
that when he confessed to Wilder that he had never gone to college,
indeed had not even finished high school, ``he almost fainted dead
away.'' But, Kanin said: ``Thornton simply took me in hand, took
pity on me, I suppose you would say, and for the next 40 years just
looked after me. He certainly was the one who told me that I should
write. That had never occurred to me. He finally told me he thought
I was ready to write a play.''
</P>
<P>
   But before there was a play there was Hollywood, where in 1937,
Samuel Goldwyn gave him a job but very little to do. In his book
``Hollywood,'' Kanin described himself on his first visit to
Goldwyn's office as ``an odd-looking, 24-year-old bundle of nerves
who had been an early high school dropout, a mediocre musician, a
burlesque stooge, a stock clerk at Macy's, a drama student, a
mildly successful minor New York actor, and the director of one
Broadway failure.'' So it came as something of a surprise when
Goldwyn greeted him saying, ``Sidney Howard tells me you're a very
clever genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanin steeped himself in movies, studying the work of the
masters of film and trying every stratagem to fulfill his pressing
ambition to be a director. Of all of the masters, he admired Frank
Capra most. ``I'd rather be Capra than God,'' Kanin said, ``if
there is a Capra.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he was able to talk Goldwyn into releasing him from his
contract, and he went to RKO to direct ``A Man to Remember,'' a
poignant story about a small-town doctor. The film was a success,
and at 25 Kanin became known as the boy wonder, the youngest
director in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   He directed six more movies before his thriving $2,800-a-week
career was cut short by the draft in 1941. He handed one of his
script ideas over to his older brother, Michael, who, with Ring
Lardner Jr. and some suggestions from Miss Hepburn and Kanin, came
up with ``Woman of the Year'' (1942), the film that teamed her and
Tracy for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In the Army, Kanin served in the Signal Corps and then in the
Office of Strategic Services. In 1943, when he was serving in
Europe, he was promoted to captain and was chosen to be
co-director, with Carol Reed, of ``The True Glory,'' a film about
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's preparations for D-Day that won him an
Academy Award in 1945. But waiting for his security clearance,
Kanin said, meant ``long stretches of excruciating boredom,'' time
that he used to develop a script that became ``Born Yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the idea started out as a serious expose of Washington
as he observed it. At first, he said, he was going to have a tycoon
arrive in the capital with three mistresses. Then two. The two
finally became one, but Kanin said he then realized that with movie
industry censorship being what it was _ ``We're talking about a
time when kisses used to be timed with a stopwatch'' _ his idea
would never work as a movie. It would have to be a play.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, it became not just a play, but a prize-winning play
with antecedents in Shaw's ``Pygmalion.'' Kanin directed Judy
Holliday in a funny and touching portrayal of Billie Dawn, the
not-so-dumb blond mistress of the tycoon Harry Brock (Paul
Douglas). In three years on Broadway, she never played to an empty
seat. The Roman Catholic press called the play a ``Marxist
satire,'' but the critics called it a hit. Miss Holliday won an
Oscar for her performance in the 1950 movie version, directed by
George Cukor. A 1993 remake, with Melanie Griffith as Billie Dawn,
got poor reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Kanin was a private in the Army when he and Ruth Gordon were
married in Washington in 1942. He was 31; she was 46. Many years
later, he wrote of his life with her: ``Married to this versatile
creature, I enjoy many of the advantages of polygamy without having
to deal with its complexities.'' Two of their movies _ ``Adam's
Rib'' and ``Pat and Mike'' _ were nominated for Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Although he spent a lot of time in Hollywood, Kanin continued to
work on Broadway. He also translated and directed a version of
``Die Fledermaus' for the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   When Kanin was given the script of ``The Diary of Anne Frank,''
he prepared himself to direct it by going to Amsterdam to meet
Anne's father and retrace the steps of the girl's life. ``I talked
to all the people who knew the Franks, who knew little Anne,'' he
said. ``I talked to their neighbors, I talked to the milkman, I
talked to her teachers from the school. I spent a lot of time in
Amsterdam just soaking it up and making her and making the family
as real to me as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making the play a tragedy, Kanin said, it became a
play about human courage, faith, hope, brotherhood, love and
self-sacrifice. ``We discovered as we went deeper and deeper,'' he
said, that it was a play about what Shaw called `the life force.'
Anne Frank was certainly killed, but she was never defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was meticulous in his research, new facts about the
Frank family became available decades later that might have altered
his portrayal of them. But his effort to get at the truth was
typical of the way he worked. ``If I do anything in the theater,''
he said, ``I steep myself in the background or even in other works
of the imagination which touch on the same subject. Remember when
you say the word playwright, the word is playwright _ W-R-I-G-H-T _
like wheelwright. A play is not so much written as wrought. It's
designed and built and shaped; it's carved out.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the plays Kanin carved out were hits. Reviewing ``Into
Thin Air'' in London in 1955, Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times
wrote that it was ``one of those little pieces of theatrical
malpractice that one sits through in a state of numbed horror.''
Reviewing another of his plays in The New York Times in 1962,
Howard Taubman wrote: ``It is distressing to believe that Garson
Kanin could perpetrate `Come On Strong.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kanin rebounded by directing the Broadway musical ``Funny
Girl,'' starring Barbra Streisand, which became a hit in 1964. Two
years earlier, he had written and directed ``A Gift of Time,'' with
Henry Fonda, which was also well received.
</P>
<P>
   Kanin, who did his writing in a studio in the Carnegie Hall
building and kept an office across the street where he stored his
memorabilia and papered the walls with theater ticket stubs and
invitations, concentrated more on books and articles in his later
years. ``Remembering Mr. Maugham'' (1966), a memoir of a long
friendship with the writer; ``Tracy and Hepburn'' (1971), another
reminiscence; and ``Hollywood'' (1974), with its funny and loving
portrait of Samuel Goldwyn, were all products of his habit of
writing down everything he heard.
</P>
<P>
   His fiction included ``Moviola'' (1979), about an attempted
takeover of a Hollywood studio, and ``Smash'' (1980), a
behind-the-scenes story of the making of a Broadway musical, and
``Cordelia'' (1982), a theatrical novel and a collection of short
stories, ``Cast of Characters'' (1969).
</P>
<P>
   Also in his later years, Kanin became an advocate for the
elderly, a campaign he took up with his book ``It Takes a Long Time
to Become Young'' (1978). He believed that no one should ever
retire from anything, and in a society taken by the cult of youth
he preached the gospel of experience. In 1985, when he was 72, he
was elected president of the Authors League of America.
</P>
<P>
   His youthful attitude was reflected in his marriage, when he was
76, to Ms. Seldes, a longtime friend and colleague. In addition to
Ms. Seldes, he is survived by a sister, Ruth Kanin, of Montreal.
Kanin believed in W. Somerset Maugham's maxim that ``it is only
happiness which ennobles.''
</P>
<P>
   But had his been a happy life? ``Not especially,'' he said in an
interview when he was 73. Was it an unhappy life? ``No,'' he said.
``I've had a life, like everybody. There were some good things in
it and a great many frustrations and disappointments and failures.
And five years cut out of a very important part of my life, to be
in the Army. It couldn't have come at a worse time. So I can hardly
call that a happy life.''

SUSPICIOUS BAG AT AIRPORT MAY BE LINKED TO EX-TRANSIT OFFICIAL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The police at the airport in Columbus, Ohio, rushed
hundreds of passengers out of a major concourse on Friday afternoon
and ordered planes pushed back from their gates, causing extensive
delays, after workers at America West Airlines took a suspicious
bag that had been checked to a security checkpoint, and screeners
saw what they suspected was a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   It was a false alarm. But Chief Richard L. Morgan, director of
public safety at the Columbus Airport Authority, said that
preliminary evidence tied the bag to Mary Schiavo, a former
inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation who had
been critical of the Federal Aviation Administration on airport
security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said that his department, which called in the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, had not verified that the bag was Ms.
Schiavo's or that she had had a ticket on the flight to Washington
on which it was checked. Nor did he describe the evidence linking
her to the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schiavo lives in the Columbus area but does not have a
listed telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Two Washington officials speaking on the condition of anonymity
said that the object found in the bag appeared to have been
intended to look like a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan and a spokesman for the FBI in Washington, Frank Scafidi,
said that it was not clear if any law had been violated but that
airport operations had been disrupted for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure caused a hell of a mess out there,'' Scafidi said. The
Franklin County bomb squad took the bag to the north runway,
closing it from 5:30 p.m. until 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At the Federal Aviation Administration, Paul Takemoto, a
spokesman, said only that ``we are aware there's been a security
incident at Port Columbus.''
</P>
<P>
   According to officials of law enforcement agencies,
transportation agencies and America West, the airline accepted a
bag at the check-in counter for its 2:58 p.m. flight from Port
Columbus International Airport to National Airport in Washington
but became suspicious when the passenger who had checked the bag
did not board the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Most checked bags are not X-rayed. They are supposed to be
scanned if the airline does not know enough about the passenger, or
if there is some other cause for suspicion, like a passenger's not
boarding.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Nowack, a spokeswoman for America West, would say only
that the bag ``was not loaded on the aircraft, in compliance with
Federal Aviation Administration rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Several planes, including a Boeing 747 belonging to Air India,
have been destroyed in flight by bombs placed in checked baggage by
people who posed as passengers but did not board.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said of Ms. Schiavo, ``Her name has been mentioned many
times'' in connection with the incident. ``The information I had
was she was going to be on TV in Washington,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David V. Whittaker, a spokesman for the airport authority, said,
``it was not an explosive device.'' But screeners ``did believe it
was'' when they saw it on X-ray, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Schiavo was inspector general she issued many reports
critical of the Federal Aviation Administration, which is part of
the Transportation Department. Her book, ``Flying Blind,'' was
published in 1996, shortly after she resigned from the department.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her most scathing criticism of the FAA was on security
issues. She said in an audit in September 1996 that FAA agents
overstated how well airports did on security tests, and made
efforts to help airports do well on the inspections.

MEXICO BEATS U.S. 2-1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO -- U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola, his lip stitched after
an unfortunate collision with Mexico's Francisco Palencia, could
barely speak following Mexico's 2-1 victory over the United States
in Saturday's U.S. Cup championship at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium
before 50,324.
</P>
<P>
   Those things tend to happen when these two heated rivals meet --
as does the result, which turned out to be Mexico's third straight
U.S. Cup title, stretching its unbeaten streak against the United
States to seven dating back to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always tension, just look at this history of these two
teams,'' said U.S. midfielder Chris Armas, facing Mexico for the
first time. ``We were outnumbered by the fans in the stands and we
accept that challenge. They got us, we got them, but in the end we
just came up a little short and that's not something anyone in this
room accepts.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, however, hardly tells the full story.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mexico, not the United States, chasing the Americans
around the field.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mexico who looked like Team USA, losing battles at
midfield on a possession-dominated U.S. day.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice change of pace -- all except the result.
</P>
<P>
   Arena, nor his troops, however, took any satisfaction with the
moral victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to win any of those battles we want to win on
the scoreboard, Arena answered when a reporter asked if he thought
his team outplayed Mexico. ``I never feel good after any kind of
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   After a moment of thinking, he compared the level of the U.S.
teams play to the Steve Sampson coached team last year that beat
Brazil, 1-0, in the Gold Cup semifinal at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to take anything away from the U.S. result against Brazil,
but I walked away from today's game feeling better about the way
our team played,'' he said. ``And we beat arguably the best team
(Brazil) in the world that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of soccer we can build on. I don't want to get
into the debate of who's better, us or Mexico, because they won the
game. But I give our guys credit, they played a heck of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans dominated the first 20 minutes, getting good looks
for forwards Brian McBride and Cobi Jones, but a quick mix-up on
the back line resulted in an own-goal and 1-0 lead for Mexico in
the 13th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Jose Manuel Abundis took a pass down the left side and
turned on U.S. defender Eddie Pope to free himself down the flank.
Abundis, looking for Palencia streaking down the middle, dropped a
pass in front of the American goal where U.S. defender Robin Fraser
and Palencia were in a shoulder-to-shoulder race toward the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Palencia over-ran the cross as Fraser slid to slow himself down
about five yards in front of the U.S. net. An unlucky break for
Fraser occured when Palencia's cross ricocheted off his right arm
into the net while Palencia plowed into Meola, cutting the U.S.
keepers lip and forcing him out of the game with a head injury.
Chicago Fire goalkeeper Zack Thornton replaced Meola.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, Fraser returned the favor with some
nifty moves down the right side to set up the equalizer in the 51st
minute.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-year Galaxy defender chased down a free ball on an
over-lapping run down the right side. He started to turn back
toward the U.S. goal but slipped under the pressure of Mexican
midfielders Alberto Garcia Aspe and Rafael Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fraser regained control and slipped by Aspe and Garcia
and headed for the Mexican net. He fired a hard shot but Pavel
Pardo stuck his foot out, allowing the ball to roll softly in front
of Frankie Hejduk, who one-touched a perfectly placed shot to the
right corner to tie the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so happy when we scored. I felt like I gave one up and
helped get one back,'' said Fraser. ``It was one of those things
where we were pushing up and I was fortunate to turn the corner,
dump it in and Frankie was able to finish it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It only lasted for a few moments, however.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Joel Sanchez headed a corner that was saved brilliantly
by Thornton, but Abundis was there to follow the rebound and score
easilly to give Mexico a 2-1 lead and the deciding goal in the 57th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some consolation in the fact that maybe we played
well,'' Fraser said. ``But I think this program is moving in the
direction where playing well is not going to be a discussion. It's
going to be about wins and losses.''

MORE PLAYING TIME FOR ROOKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For most of the last two seasons, Sean Rooks' role
with the Lakers has consisted of a set routine: Play hard for 30
minutes or so, work up a good sweat . . . and then find a good seat
on the bench before tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   Rooks didn't have to worry that his pregame workout routine
would affect his energy level during the game. It didn't take much
energy to watch and cheer. But his minutes are now better spent.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers sent Eddie Jones to Charlotte for Glen Rice,
they also unloaded backup forward-center Elden Campbell, and the 15
minutes a game that Shaquille O'Neal rests now belong mostly to
Rooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can play,'' said Rooks, reassuringly. ``Ever since I've been
here, I've been put on the bench like I'm lucky to be a Laker or
something. I've just never really had the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   That's no longer a problem. After appearing in a career-low 41
games last season, and usually in garbage time, Rooks began working
himself into the rotation this year even before Campbell's
departure. The seven-year veteran has played in 19 of 22 games and
is averaging 9.2 minutes, 3.2 points and 2.2 rebounds. Those
numbers could climb now that he's the only true center on the
roster behind O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's been playing very well,'' coach Kurt Rambis said.
``Any time he's gotten consistent minutes with us, he has performed
very well. You can't look at a player's numbers whenever he doesn't
play for five games, then plays for 10 minutes in three different
stints . . . or two minutes of garbage time. It's not fair to
critique a player that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooks, almost forgotten last season, is eager to prove himself
in his third year with the Lakers. But he's assuming nothing with
regard to playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've assumed in the past and you know the saying about
assuming,'' he said, ``so I'm not taking anything for granted.
Whenever Kurt or (assistants) Larry (Drew) or Bert (Bill Bertka)
calls my name, I just want to go out there and try to give the team
a boost.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Derek Harper, Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal all
sat out workouts, but only Harper is a concern. The 16-year veteran
suffered a moderate sprain of his left ankle Friday night and was
limping around with an ice bag Saturday. He's listed as a game-time
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling a lot better today,'' he said. ``I think I'll be
all right. I'm gonna try to (play today). If I can, I definitely
will. I hate missing games.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll be needed on this trip, considering the point guards the
Lakers face: Sacramento rookie Jason Williams, Minnesota's Terrell
Brandon, Philadelphia's Allen Iverson and Orlando's Penny Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is nursing a minor sprain in his right ankle but will
play today. O'Neal sat out for precautionary reasons.

RODMAN TO SKIP LAKERS' ROAD TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Lakers signed Dennis Rodman, they knew
they were buying two players for the price of one. One is the
basketball genius. The other, walking chaos.
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions, they got nine games, all wins, with Good
Dennis before Bad Dennis emerged Saturday. Rodman skipped practice
without explanation, then showed up just long enough to tell coach
Kurt Rambis he won't be around for a while. How long isn't certain.
All the Lakers know for sure is they embarked on a crucial
six-game, nine-day road trip starting tonight in Sacramento without
their prized rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has non-basketball-related personal issues that he needs to
take care of. It is indefinite how long he'll be out, but he's not
going with us on the road,'' team publicist Tom Savage said,
minutes after Rodman sped away in a white Mercedes with dark
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers spokesman John Black later said the team considers
Rodman's absence ``excused'' but said any possible disciplinary
action ``will be handled internally.'' General manager Mitch
Kupchak and executive vice president Jerry West declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we'd prefer to have him playing,'' Black said,
``but we understand what his situation is and we're willing to give
him the time off to take care of what he needs to take care of.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first blot on Rodman's short record with the
Lakers, but it is the most serious. He was fined for arriving 30
minutes late to his first team practice, was excused from a
practice last week to attend to ``personal business'' and was
thrown out of Wednesday's game against the Clippers when referees
grew tired of his banter.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Rodman has garnered more attention for setting a
perfect on-court example for the Lakers. He's been all hustle and
rebounds, earning Rambis' praise as a ``genius'' for his basketball
savvy and occasional coaching tips.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Rambis spent several minutes in animated discussion
with Rodman's bodyguards, who arrived before Rodman did, behind the
gym at Southwest College, the Lakers' practice site. Rodman finally
arrived just before 1 p.m _ 90 minutes after practice began and 15
minutes after it concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman and Rambis spoke briefly before Rodman returned to his
car and sped away, but the coach had no insight into Rodman's
situation and ``no idea'' when he might rejoin the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to say,'' said Rambis. Though he spoke with
Rodman, ``nothing got resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers start their longest road trip of the season
without their most proficient rebounder, though they are well
stocked at the position with starter Travis Knight, newly acquired
J.R. Reid and veteran Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis offered a long pause when asked if he was bothered by the
situation, then repeated his standby philosophy for Rodman-related
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad always told me you do the best you can with what you've
got,'' he said. ``That's just the way I look at life. If he's
there, great; if he's not, then I just have to adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's storied NBA career has been peppered with similar
incidents and impromptu trips to Las Vegas, so the Lakers were at
least mentally prepared for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm not gonna freak out about it,'' Rambis said.
``It's just something we're gonna have to deal with and we're not
gonna let it disrupt us, and we're just going to continue to move
on. We have a talented ballclub and I can make adjustments and we
will go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Players left Southwest College before the news of Rodman's
hiatus hit. All they knew was he was missing for a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work as hard as him, I don't give a damn what you do in
practice,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ``That guy works hard in the
game, so I don't have a problem with it. . . . I think you guys
(reporters) want it to be a problem more than we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get a couple (championship) rings, I'm doing the same
stuff,'' O'Neal joked. ``I ain't going to training camp, I ain't
going to practice, I ain't going to games.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Harper declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not gonna say a word about it,'' he said. ``I just want a
ring, man. I want to slide one of those rings on.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Derek Fisher, unaware Rodman was missing more than a
practice: ``Nobody really seems to worry about where Dennis is or
what he's gonna do. As long as when he shows up to the game, he's
ready to rebound and play defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time in three weeks, they can't even be sure
of that much.

KARROS IS DODGERS' VALUED VETERAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ At some moment, Eric Karros went from being a
Dodger to being a symbol for the Dodgers. He was the first baseman,
is the first baseman, and is also much more.
</P>
<P>
   It just, sort of . . . happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the link from the past to the present,'' Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone said. ``He's the guy that's recognized as a
Dodger. I see stability, dependability and consistency when I look
at Eric Karros.''
</P>
<P>
   When pitcher Ramon Martinez signed a free-agent contract with
the Boston Red Sox, ending a 14-year association with the Dodgers
that included 10 years at the major-league level, Karros became the
player with the most seniority in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than spending seven-plus seasons with the Dodgers
and goes beyond his 11 years in the organization. Karros doesn't
just play in L.A. He lives there, trains there. He's always there.
When Kevin Brown signed his free-agent contract, people expected
Karros to be at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a sense of history. My father was a huge Dodgers fan,
my brother was a huge Dodgers fan, so I knew about the Dodgers
before I was even drafted,'' Karros said. ``It's a little more
meaningful now because I'm one of the few guys who can be linked to
the past teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Since being promoted to the Dodgers on Sept. 1, 1991, aside from
a four-game rehabilitation stint with San Bernardino last season,
Karros has been with the L.A. club. He's helped bridge the gap from
the family-owned Dodgers to corporate ownership, and he's been the
rock of stability amid the chaos. In the consistently altered
atmosphere of baseball, Karros is the quiet constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aware of (the link),'' Karros said. ``I don't know what
the significance is. I understand it and I respect it, but my focus
is the 1999 season. I'm sure I will understand it one day.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Karros or anyone can plan such a path. Some
players last forever in a city and never attain such a level.
</P>
<P>
   For Karros, the foundation was set when he triggered the
Dodgers' Rookie of the Year parade in 1992 by hitting 20 homers
with 88 RBI. He's hit at least 23 homers and driven in 80 runs in
each nonstrike season since, and during a three-year stretch
averaged 32 homers and 107 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when I came up in '94 you had that feeling,'' pitcher
Darren Dreifort said. ``Everybody has respect for him because of
the time he's put in and because of the numbers he's put up.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the statistics and experience lies more.
</P>
<P>
   Karros could have cracked when the Dodgers left him unprotected
in the last expansion draft, but he said little. When he began last
season on the disabled list after arthroscopic knee surgery, and
the world was trumpeting Paul Konerko as the next Rookie of the
Year for the Dodgers, he remained silent. And he returned from the
injury _ earlier than expected, of course _ to hit .296 with 23
homers and 87 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Other players recognize that approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to play with one club all through our careers, but
most times it's not possible,'' said shortstop Mark Grudzielanek,
traded to the Dodgers from the Montreal Expos last season. ``He's
doing it. There's no question what he means to this organization.
Once you get over here you understand what he means.''
</P>
<P>
   To the players, to the organization, Karros seems to mean a lot.
He senses that, but he doesn't want to talk too much about it. Not
after 1,030 games without winning a playoff game, and with the
World Series seemingly within grasp this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest,'' Karros said. ``I'm playing for the selfish
reason that I want to get to a World Series. I want to win a World
Series.''

TRADE-MINDED GMS WATCH PITCHERS
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The search for pitching is consuming many general managers' time
during spring training. Those pitchers who are available or might
be available during the season are drawing large numbers of scouts
when they take the mound.
</P>
<P>
   The rundown on the candidates:
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Appier _ The Royals are openly shopping their one-time ace
who missed most of last year because of a shoulder injury. The
Royals want prospects in return, but clubs are reluctant to bite
until they are convinced he's healthy again.
</P>
<P>
   Appier pitched three scoreless innings against the Dodgers on
Wednesday and said afterward, ``It feels better than it has in
years. I threw the slider for the first time today, and it felt
pretty good. I was keeping the ball down and had better control.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Anderson _ The Diamondbacks have a surplus of starters and
are willing to trade Anderson. But they insist on getting a
front-line player in return and so far are only being offered
reserves. He could end up as a $1.8 million reliever; owner Jerry
Colangelo has told his baseball people Anderson doesn't have to be
traded.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schilling _ He has offered to waive his no-trade demands,
but general manager Ed Wade insists he's staying ... for now. If
the Phillies aren't in contention come July, then Schilling will be
the big prize at the trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers _ The next big prize after Schilling, and the
Rangers want him. But the Athletics aren't inclined to trade him
just yet, although that could change in July.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hentgen _ Right now the Blue Jays aren't dealing, but that
could change by the end of spring training if they feel rookie Roy
Halladay is ready to step into the rotation. There has been talk
about sending Hentgen to the Angels for an outfielder, either Jim
Edmonds or Garret Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Blue Jays are concerned about Hentgen's shoulder
and David Wells' back. Toronto general manager Gord Ash doesn't
want to trade a starter, only to have another one go down with an
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser _ He's in the Indians camp on a minor-league
contract, but can cut his own deal with another team after March 21
if he's not put on the 40-man roster. He's unlikely to make the
Indians' rotation unless there is an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Fernandez _ He could be the Marlins' Opening Day starter
after missing all of last season with a torn rotator cuff. The
Marlins say they don't have to trade him just because he makes $7
million and may hold onto him. But more likely they'll wait until
after the season starts. The more people are convinced he's
healthy, the better deal they can make.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Myers _ He makes $6 million, which is incredibly expensive
for a setup reliever. He wants to close again, but the Padres have
Trevor Hoffman. They would also love to dump his salary, but there
are no takers so far. Considering the scarce availability of
left-handed relief, somebody might take a chance if the Padres help
out on the weekly payments.
</P>
<P>
   REJUVENATED CANSECO SEES 600 HOME RUNS IN HIS FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   Jose Canseco is back, feeling better than ever, although with
his fifth team since 1992. Once given up for dead after all his
injuries, Canseco came back to life with the Blue Jays last year,
hitting 46 home runs and driving in 107 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco, 34, is with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and still saying
his checkered career will have a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, people are talking about 500 home runs,
I'm thinking about 600,'' said Canseco, who has 397 career home
runs. ``I stay in very good shape. I don't see why I can't play
until I'm 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco was the one who started all the Roger Clemens commotion
this off-season. The Blue Jays' failure to re-sign him was a major
reason why Clemens demanded a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a very good run'' at the end of the 1998 season,
Canseco said of the Blue Jays. ``And I thought after that, geez, if
we keep the same team. Some of the younger players will be older. I
thought maybe if we got one more player we could contend with the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't think I was in their plans. I think it was
obvious last year at the All-Star break when I had 24 home runs and
24 stolen bases and they didn't re-sign me by then. Especially when
I had approached them a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays eventually offered Canseco a base contract of $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Jays GM) Gord Ash told me that over the phone, and I
said `Are you serious?' '' Canseco said. ``Guys are signing for $10
or $15 million. Guys are 15 times better than me? That means if you
multiply 46 home runs times 15 that's what they're hitting. Six
hundred home runs a year...''
HARGROVE'S CHALLENGE
</P>
<P>
   Indians manager Mike Hargrove has set two simple goals for this
season. He wants to win more than 100 games during the regular
season, and he wants to win the World Series. He told the team that
before their first full-squad workout, then he went public with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year we have meetings and say we're going to do this and
that,'' Hargrove said. ``Then we turn around and tell the public,
`We just want to get to the postseason and see what happens.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I said, `Let's be honest. Here it is out in the
open. I want to win the World Series.' This is my way of publicly
challenging the team.''
GRIFFEY-PINIELLA
</P>
<P>
   This exchange occurred between Ken Griffey Jr. and Lou Piniella
at the batting cage, after Junior had fouled off a bunt attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a little work on your bunting,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm bunting, we're in trouble,'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have you squeeze a couple times this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why go for one run when I can swing and get you two?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to make your manager look good sometimes,'' Piniella
said. ``They see you squeezing, they'll be calling me a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They see me squeezing, they'll be sending you home, skip.''
SHEFFIELD'S WOES
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' Gary Sheffield has agreed to switch to left field,
but he's having some trouble. Monday in Fort Lauderdale, Orioles
outfielder Brady Anderson hit a fly ball to left that got caught up
in the wind and ended up hitting Sheffield in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always bragged about it, playing right field, that I never
got hit in the head,'' Sheffield said. ``And then I'm playing left,
and the first batter, I get hit in the head. They're still laughing
about it in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield was laughing, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to laugh to keep from crying,'' Sheffield said.
``It's whatever's best for Mondesi. If he can go out and have an
MVP season, it's good for the team. I don't care where I play, I
just want to be respected out there. I don't want to kill the team
out there.''
DAVIS BLASTS ORIOLES
</P>
<P>
   Former Orioles outfielder Eric Davis took some shots at his team
after being told he wasn't re-signed because of doubts about his
right elbow, which he favored for much of last year.
</P>
<P>
   That was news to Davis, who managed to play through it and run
off a 30-game hitting streak on the way to an outstanding offensive
season. He was annoyed at manager Ray Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was concerned about that, why didn't he pick up a phone
and call me and ask how my elbow was?'' Davis said. ``Ray didn't
call me, Frank (Wren) didn't call me, so it couldn't have been a
concern. Don't you think you should ask instead of assuming?
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't concerned about it when we were five games out.
They weren't concerned when I was hitting in all those games and
doing what I'm doing, so during the offseason you're concerned
about my elbow? I think it's an excuse.''
SHORT HOPS
</P>
<P>
   _ Former TCU pitcher Tim Grieve has hung up the uniform and is
working as a scout for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   _ No wonder the Reds can't afford free agents. Their media guide
lists 22 people on their medical staff including three physical
therapists, two neurosurgical consultants, a dental consultant, a
massage therapist, a podiatric consultant and a foot and ankle
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   _ Braves general manager John Schuerholz said the club is
comfortable with Ryan Klesko at first base and _ for now _ will not
pursue a trade for a replacement for Andres Galarraga. nn

TWO BIG DEALS; TWO DIFFERENT REASONS
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two major trades. Two drastically different motives.
</P>
<P>
   Though both will have an impact on the NBA's balance of power
this season and beyond, the Lakers' acquisition of Glen Rice was a
desperate attempt to win a championship while the Timberwolves'
dealing of Stephon Marbury was simply desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Though Minnesota is obviously on the short end of Thursday's
nine-player, three-team swap in which they basically traded Stephon
Marbury for Terrell Brandon and the Nets' upcoming lottery pick,
the Timberwolves had no choice. Marbury, from Brooklyn, wanted to
play back home and threatened to leave Minnesota next summer as a
free agent, leaving the Timberwolves with nothing to show for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and his agent (David Falk) held our feet to the fire,''
said Timberwolves general manager Kevin McHale. ``It was either
trade him now or lose him for nothing later.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Timberwolves salvaged something for Marbury, their
grand plan has been shattered in the last three months. Once
figured to ride the trio of Marbury-Kevin Garnett-Tom Gugliotta to
title contention, Minnesota has now lost Marbury and Gugliotta, who
signed with the Phoenix Suns as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame Minnesota. McHale talked last week with Falk about a
maximum six-year, $71 million contract extension last week, but was
turned down. Now, Marbury says he plans to sign an identical deal
with the Nets, who sent Sam Cassell and Chris Gatling to the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't put into words how disappointing it is,'' said
Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders. ``You can throw the word loyalty
right out the window these days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, meanwhile, gave up two talented players in Eddie
Jones and Elden Campbell. But what they got in return could be the
missing pieces to the championship puzzle in Rice, a sharp-shooter,
and rugged power forward J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a shooter, and I got another thug power forward,'' said
Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal. ``Ain't no excuses now, for me or
anybody else in this locker room. We should be on our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Give Jerry West _ again _ all the credit. Jones can't do
anything that Kobe Bryant can't do better, and Campbell has always
been a defensive liability. Last summer, West had an immature team
swept out of the playoffs by the Utah Jazz. Since then, he has
added a young coach (Kurt Rambis) players relate to, a veteran
leader (Derek Harper), the game's best rebounder (Dennis Rodman)
and arguably the league's best pure shooter (Rice).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our front line in particular, we think we have
the best center in the league, we probably have the best rebounder
in the league in Dennis, and maybe we'll have the best shooter as a
small forward and one of the best players in the league at small
forward,'' said West. ``Our backcourt is a concern, but it was a
concern before. We do think we have an attractive team, and a team
that can compete in a playoff series against anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bucks coach George Karl, ``That trade makes me bitter. The
Lakers are a very, very powerful team that just got much better.''
RICE TRADE CONTINUES TREND OF HORNETS' STINGY WAYS
</P>
<P>
   Add Glen Rice to the name of former Hornets stars _ Alonzo
Mourning, Larry Johnson, Vlade Divac, Matt Geiger _ whom the team
traded rather than paid.
</P>
<P>
   Trading Rice was another example of Charlotte's favorite parlor
trick: swap their best and most expensive player to avoid paying
him. The deal is eerily similar to the Mourning trade to Miami.
Mourning went to the Heat and Rice, Geiger, Khalid Reeves and a
first-round pick to Charlotte. When Rice and Geiger matured into
top players, they were also let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typical Charlotte,'' Mourning said of trading Rice. ``Typical
George Shinn. As long as Eddie Jones is a free agent at the end of
next season, they'll probably lose him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' contract runs out after next season, and he's already on
record as saying he wants the maximum for his experience group ($11
million). So the Hornets start this whole silly process over again.
</P>
<P>
   Give coach Dave Cowens credit for knowing when to get out.
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE EAST
</P>
<P>
   What do the Bulls, 76ers, Hawks and Suns have in common? They
entered yesterday with better road records than home records. ...
Though ESPN expert Jack Ramsay picked them to win the East before
the season, isn't it time for them to change their name to the New
Jersey Nyets? ... Bucks coach George Karl isn't one to back down
from a grudge. ``My animosity comes from the fact I want the truth
to come out,'' Karl said last week before his team defeated the
Sonics, whose GM, Wally Walker, fired him last summer. ``And the
truth is, when you talk about the construction of the tradition
that we had in Seattle, Wally Walker's name should be sixth or
seventh on the rung of importance. Wally's not an innovator. He's
just there.''
AROUND THE WEST
</P>
<P>
   It almost got to the point where you had the feeling the
Clippers' next victory was going to coincide with the Y2K scare.
... It shouldn't come as any surprise that Mavericks coach Don
Nelson gave his players a choice to play on the slick surface at
Reunion Arena. Remember, it was Nelson who allowed Derek Harper to
veto a trade to Utah that would've brought the Mavericks Greg
Foster and Howard Eisley two years ago. ... Mild-mannered, quiet
star Shareef Abdur-Rahim could bite his tongue no longer after
watching his dismal Grizzlies' 15-point home loss to Houston last
week. ``We're supposed to be pros, but we look like damn high
schoolers out there,'' he said. Help apparently isn't on the way.
``A minor trade at this point is not going to correct our team,''
said GM Stu Jackson. ``If we get David Robinson or bring Michael
Jordan out of retirement, that would correct our ills. Anything
short of that is cosmetics.''
BEST AND WORST
</P>
<P>
   Best coaching move: Instead of being 9-0 with the Lakers, Kurt
Rambis could have been 1-17 with the Clippers. ``I went pretty far
with my consideration for that job,'' said Rambis, who turned down
LA's other team last summer. ``It would just be real tough for me
as a first-year head coach to be 0-17. People would be saying `Kurt
must be lousy as a coach'.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst coaching move: Sonics coach Paul Westphal moves Detlef
Schrempf to the bench as Seattle goes on its first five-game losing
streak since 1991. The Sonics won their first six games but are 3-7
in their past 10.
INSIDE THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   Next time you hear an NBA player complaining about three games
in three nights, tell them to consider the plight of the Chicago
Bulls and guard Jerry Sloan in 1967-68. That team played five games
in five nights three times within 30 days with two of the sets in
five different cities. The Bulls broke 100 points in all 15 games:
11-21-67 at New York 123-125 11-22-67 at Baltimore 105-100 11-23-67
at Milwaukee 106-96 11-24-67 vs. Philadelphia 104-122 11-25-67 at
Philadelphia 119-114 12-5-67 at Cincinnati 105-104 12-6-67 at
Detroit 121-135 12-7-67 vs. San Diego 108-118 12-8-67 at Seattle
115-114 12-9-67 at San Francisco 112-119 12-12-67 at San Diego
104-118 12-13-67 at San Francisco 109-104 12-14-67 at Los Angeles

IOWA FINDS WAY TO EXTEND DAVIS' STAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Defying the odds and denying the temptation to pound a
how-do-you-like-me-now pulpit, Iowa coach Tom Davis' farewell tour
marches on.
</P>
<P>
   Next destination: the Hawkeyes' first Sweet 16 appearance in the
NCAA men's basketball tournament since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, the only team in the tournament with a lame-duck coach,
rallied from a 13-point deficit in the second half yesterday to
oust Arkansas, 82-72, at McNichols Sports Arena. By doing so, the
Hawkeyes prolonged Davis' stay at the school for at least another
week, which proved to be ample reason for lengthy postgame hugs and
free-flowing tears among players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the emotion involved in watching his fifth-seeded
Hawkeyes (20-9) rally to down the fourth-seeded Razorbacks (23-11)
after all seemed lost with 18 minutes remaining, Davis didn't mince
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so deep, I don't think I can do it justice,'' Davis said,
his voice cracking. ``I'm just trying to have fun and not worry
about the bigger questions until it's over. But it was almost over
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Hawkeyes thrust themselves back into the game
behind the long-range jumpers of guard Kent McCausland and a
full-court, pressure defense that hounded the Razorbacks into 12
second-half turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 47-34 with 18 minutes to play, McCausland _ who scored
15 of his 17 points after intermission _ buried three consecutive
three-pointers to trigger a 16-0 run that put the Hawkeyes on top,
50-46, at the 14:42 mark. When the Razorbacks appeared to regain
control with a spurt of their own, Iowa closed with a 23-6 stretch
in the final seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, McCausland began the pivotal stretch with
back-to-back three-pointers. That trimmed a 66-59 deficit to 66-65
with 6:17 remaining. Then, the really amazing stuff started. The
Iowa press forced four turnovers and two steals down the stretch,
helping the Hawkeyes pull away from a team that prides itself on
its ``40 minutes of hell'' approach to pressure defense.
</P>
<P>
   A stunned Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson acknowledged the irony
of the Iowa comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the game totally reversed itself,'' said Richardson,
whose team forced 18 turnovers in the first half but only six after
intermission. ``We couldn't handle their press. We couldn't even
get the ball inbounds at times. When we did, they did a great job
of making us cough it up, so they could spot up for jumpers.''
CONNECTICUT 78, NEW MEXICO 56 Among his team's many assets,
Connecticut basketball coach Jim Calhoun lists ``spurtability'' at
the top of the list when discussing his top-seeded Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   The word may not be in Webster's Dictionary, but it refers to
UConn's penchant for scoring points in huge hunks. New Mexico got
buried under two separate deluges yesterday, as the Huskies routed
the Lobos in McNichols Sports Arena to seal the team's seventh trip
to the ``Sweet 16'' round of the NCAA tournament in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut (30-2), the No. 1 seed in the West Regional, wasted
little time in removing any suspense from this contest by scoring
the first 17 points of the game. After the Lobos (25-9) regrouped,
the Huskies opened the second half with a 13-0 salvo to carve out a
50-22 advantage that turned the final 16:31 into an anticlimactic
exercise in emptying benches and accumulating statistics.
</P>
<P>
   When the final numbers were counted, New Mexico catalyst Kenny
Thomas once again proved to be little more than a blip on the radar
screen in an NCAA tournament game. Thomas, a 6-foot-8 center,
played 30 minutes without a field goal and scored a career-low one
point in his final college game. In eight NCAA appearances, Thomas
has scored 9.4 points per contest, well below his career average
(15.7).
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, meanwhile, rolled behind the transition baskets of
Khalid El-Amin and Richard Hamilton, who each scored 21 points and
triggered the Huskies' telling spurts. The duo combined for 11 of
the Huskies' first 17 points and contributed 11 points during
Connecticut's 13-0 run to start the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get on one of these streaks, we're as good as anybody
in the country,'' Calhoun said. ``That's the way we've been all
year, when we're playing good defense. And we played great defense
today. That's where the `spurtability' comes from.''

SKY HARBOR FACES NEW MILLENNIUM WITH NOWHERE LEFT TO GROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The little Cessna plane saw an opportunity where others didn't.
Ignoring air-traffic controllers' orders to circle, the plane
squeezed between two Boeing 737s on their approach to Sky Harbor
International Airport. It was enough to give the controllers heart
palpitations.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Cessna touched down, it proceeded down the wrong
taxiway. Bring out the nitroglycerine pills.
</P>
<P>
   The January 1998 episode ended without incident but provided a
teeth-gnashing glimpse of life at an airport that's flying into the
21st century by the seat of its pants. Pilot errors such as the one
involving the Cessna are being reported to the Federal Aviation
Administration much more frequently. And that's only part of the
story of the airport's rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   Sky Harbor now ranks third worst in the nation in departure
delays caused by airport conditions. Delays more than doubled last
year, up 121 percent, a faster rate than any other U.S. airport.
</P>
<P>
   Urban air pollution delayed more flights at Sky Harbor last year
than did weather in soggy Seattle or smoggy Pittsburgh. Parking,
already tight, is expected to get worse before it gets better. The
Terminal 4 parking garage will double in size, but on an
excruciatingly slow schedule designed to minimize the disruption in
existing spots.
</P>
<P>
   Few cities in America demand more of their airports than
Phoenix. The Valley wants Sky Harbor to be all things to all
people, from student pilots and small-aircraft operators to a
rapidly growing number of commercial-airline passengers who want an
airport conveniently located in the middle of a big city.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; But as Sky Harbor continues to expand, the region faces a
crucial question: Can the airport continue to please everyone
without creating a glut of delays and inconveniences for travelers?
</P>
<P>
   Sky Harbor, with only two runways and a central-city location,
averages 1,460 takeoffs and landings a day. Add in helicopters and
emergency ``lifeguard'' planes that criss-cross the airport, and
traffic was so brisk last year that it made the airport the
fifth-busiest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   It's only going to get busier. &QL; 
PUSHING THE ENVELOPE
</P>
<P>
   The afterburners are on, now that America West Airlines has
scratched merger talks. The airline plans a 40 percent increase in
traffic within the year. Airport officials are pushing cargo as Sky
Harbor's big-growth frontier. A new cargo building is under
construction, and FedEx already has leased 42 percent of the space.
</P>
<P>
   By 2015, Sky Harbor could be handling 2,050 daily flights,
according to an airport study. That's an average of 85 flights an
hour, although traffic would be heavier in the day and evening.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing in the wake of Sky Harbor's supersonic growth are
problems ranging from delays to parking woes to the dicey mix of
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Some relief will come when a third runway opens next spring.
</P>
<P>
   A controversial fourth runway could be built in the future, but
Phoenix isn't sure where to put it.
</P>
<P>
   The city grounded a plan last April after AlliedSignal Engines,
one of the city's largest employers, discovered it was in the path
of the project. The company said it didn't want to move.
</P>
<P>
   The airport's long-term master plan has been on ice ever since,
leaving Sky Harbor without a blueprint to guide growth through
2025.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many local planners say Sky Harbor should hold its own
for decades to come. They note that the airport has never had a
fatal collision, and that travel delays haven't prompted airlines
to move to roomier conditions. An airport can do a lot with a
limited number of runways.
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so optimistic. They feel the Valley is missing the
chance to stake out valuable turf for a future regional airport.
They warn that without a new plan in hand, the entire Valley will
suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull's newly formed transportation task force may take
on the thorny aviation-planning issue. But for now, the outlook is
for Sky Harbor to continue growing in its central _ but landlocked
_ location.
</P>
<P>
   Its growth is taking off faster than the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   What will give with growth?
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope, nothing,'' said Phoenix's acting aviation director
David Krietor.
</P>
<P>
   But the growing pains are evident. Small aircraft weaving
between commercial airliners and U.S. National Guard planes make
air-traffic controllers, and many commercial pilots, increasingly
nervous. FAA officials, who filed the report on the Cessna, contend
it likely means nothing more than an inattentive pilot. But others
say it's at least partly a symptom of the airport's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines are cramming more and more flights into our
airports every year,'' said Jon Russell, safety chairman for the
Western region of the Air Line Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in pilot errors reported by the FAA may be due to
more diligent reporting, said Stock of the air-traffic controllers'
union. FAA officials say the increase doesn't necessarily bode
poorly for Sky Harbor: A quarter of them involved airspace
violations miles away from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   To help deal with the increase in air traffic, FAA and city
officials are lobbying Congress for a new air-traffic control
tower. The current one is too small, too short, and ill-equipped to
handle the airport's growing needs, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods are another concern. Some Tempe residents, having
hammered out an agreement that limits the noise from departing
aircraft, would like to get similar restrictions on landings. &QL; 
PASSENGERS SUFFER
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated passengers are on the increase.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Glazier flies out of Sky Harbor weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Inching forward in a long line snaking back from a metal
detector, he talked about the airport's shortcomings _ and its
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Parking is an increasingly big headache, he said. So big that
he's ready to switch to the more-remote economy lot rather than
thread through Terminal 4's parking garage in search of a spot that
might not be there.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes longer to fly to his destinations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like there are a lot of delays, but I don't know
if it's America West or the airport,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Glazier wouldn't trade the airport for a new, more
distant one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for me,'' he said of Sky Harbor's location. ``It's
central to my office and central to my home.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE RUNWAYS
</P>
<P>
   Sentiments like these only fuel plans for Sky Harbor to grow in
place, which is typical of airports nationwide. From San Francisco
to St. Louis, Los Angeles to Boston, airports are growing, not
relocating.
</P>
<P>
   Growth doesn't always translate into building more
land-consuming runways, said Dick Marchi, senior vice president for
technical and environmental affairs at the Airports Council
International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most airports have seen growth beyond what was projected 20
years ago,'' he said. ``And few of them have added new runways.''
</P>
<P>
   Sky Harbor has operated for decades on two runways, allowing it
to claim the title of the busiest two-runway airport not only in
the nation, but in the world.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the airport has had a clean safety record.
There have been no major crashes. In the past five years, two near
midair collisions have been reported over the airport, one in
February 1996 and the other in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Planning started 20 years ago for the third runway. Under
construction on the airport's south side, it will allow the airport
to handle 15 to 20 percent more flights, said George Sullivan,
air-traffic manager for the Phoenix air-traffic control tower and
the radar network that covers the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said it's hard to predict how long _ or how soon _ it
will be before growth eclipses the breathing room the new runway
will provide. ``We think it will improve a little bit,'' he said.
``(But) there's only so much you can do with the circumstances we
have.'' &QL; 
MINIMIZING NOISE
</P>
<P>
   Those circumstances are the limitations on flight departures
over Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   A noise-abatement agreement between the cities of Phoenix and
Tempe requires aircraft departing to the east to fly over the Salt
River.
</P>
<P>
   While this contains jet noise to a narrow area, the funneling
effect of the corridor makes it impossible for planes to depart
simultaneously from two _ or three _ runways, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the promise of a third runway, it will be 2004 before
Sky Harbor can truly claim to be a three-runway airport. That's
because as soon as the new runway opens, the northern runway will
close for a lengthening and resurfacing project. After that, the
remaining runway will be repaved.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said Sky Harbor may be able to operate with 2{ runways
during this phase by running smaller aircraft, which don't need as
much distance, on the western or eastern halves of whichever runway
is being resurfaced. &QL; 
DELAYS, DELAYS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Growth has already strained Sky Harbor's two runways.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, only LaGuardia International and Newark International
turned in a worse performance when it came to delays caused by
airport conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Figures provided by the FAA show that Sky Harbor last year had
5,484 ``volume delays'' _ flights that took more than 15 minutes to
depart because of crowded runway conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the airport's makeup for this poor rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two runways, too many airplanes,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   There are several times when it seems everyone wants to push
back from the airport's 87 gates, Sullivan said. Peak times are the
early morning until 10 a.m., and again from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Weather, surprisingly, was the source of 4,150 delays last year.
Blame that on air pollution, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure you see the air out there,'' Sullivan said, referring
to the Valley's brown cloud of pollution. ``When the sun is setting
or rising, you can't do visual (flight operations.)''
</P>
<P>
   With the sun bouncing off suspended particles, pilots can't see
well enough to navigate on sight alone. That means they have to
take off and land using instrument flight rules, a more
time-consuming process, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Sky Harbor posted the ninth-worst delay record when
other factors, such as equipment breakdowns, are added. &QL; 
A STEADFAST TENANT
</P>
<P>
   The current strains, coupled with projections that envision Sky
Harbor handling as many as 753,000 flights by 2015, only steel
opinions that the airport one day will add a fourth runway.
</P>
<P>
   In fall 1997, an airport panel recommended that the city build a
fourth runway on the airport's northern edge. Mayor Skip Rimsza,
who put the runway plans on hold last April, said he is nonetheless
``absolutely'' convinced that AlliedSignal will move some day.
</P>
<P>
   The turbine-engine manufacturer's lease for its airport land
expires in &UR; 2048, &UR; but Rimsza said he expects a move could happen
before then.
</P>
<P>
   ``When AlliedSignal is ready for us to move them and wants us to
move them, we will,'' Rimsza said.
</P>
<P>
   But AlliedSignal, in a written statement, reiterated that it has
no interest in moving and noted that its lease with the city
protects it from being moved for runway expansion.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth runway would ensure safer operations because the outer
two runways could be used for landings, while the inner two could
be dedicated to takeoffs, said David Stock, spokesman for the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The optimum situation is a fourth runway,'' he said. ``That's
a slick operation. You can land on two (runways) constantly,
without worrying about departures.''
</P>
<P>
   But future runways would have to stick to the same
noise-reducing rules already in place. &QL; 
WHY NOT WILLIAMS?
</P>
<P>
   Some Tempe residents already are talking about the need to
further curb noise, and they question why Williams Gateway Airport
in Mesa is not being prepped as a major reliever airport.
</P>
<P>
   North Tempe resident Tim Donnelly said noise pollution can reach
toxic levels near an airport. His neighbors would like to see noise
limits put on arriving aircraft, similar to those for departing
planes.
</P>
<P>
   And although he accepts that Sky Harbor will be a neighbor long
into the future, he says Valley planners should be prepared to
split off some air traffic to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   `Even now we see Williams being hemmed in by rogue county
development,'' Donnelly said. That could hamper Williams' growth as
a reliever airport.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Williams is a reliever airport for Sky Harbor, but
it is unclear when the former military base on the Valley's
southeastern edge will start taking some of that business. No
passenger service operates out of Williams, and the major operators
at Sky Harbor _ America West and Southwest Airlines _ have no
interest in splitting their operations to serve two Valley
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Arizona State University Professor Larry Gesell,
question why no one is seriously pursuing the airport that will
handle Valley traffic by the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   He likes the idea of a regional airport built on a fresh patch
of ground far from urban constraints, such as noise agreements, and
with plenty of room to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Williams can't fill that bill, said Gesell, a professor of
aeronautical technology. Its runways point northwest to southeast,
meaning departing planes would be on a collision course with Sky
Harbor's east-west movements. And Williams is being hemmed in by
urban development, further restricting its ability to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Browning, director of the Greater Phoenix Leadership and a
former Luke Air Force Base commander, thinks the Sky
Harbor-Williams system could handle air traffic well into the
future.
</P>
<P>
   But then what? Airports aren't built overnight, Browning said,
and an impartial body should explore aviation options well into the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   If not, the Valley risks repeating the same mistakes it made
with another facet of its transportation system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at how long it's taken us to build the freeways, for
crying out loud,'' Browning said. &QL;

GEORGIAN LEARNING IT'S TOUGH BEING A WINSTON CUP ROOKIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Ga. _ One of the dire preseason predictions given to
NASCAR Winston Cup rookie Roy ``Buckshot'' Jones has come to
fruition.
</P>
<P>
   Jones qualified a career-best seventh on Friday for today's
Cracker Barrel 500 at the Atlanta Motor Speedway. It will be Jones'
second consecutive Cup start after failing to qualify for the
opening two races of the 1999 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   And as 1998 Cup rookie Jerry Nadeau advised Jones late last
season, Winston Cup is where the fun starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to Jerry at Talladega,'' Jones said, ``and he
said, `You're going to have a lot of fun this season. I said, `What
do you mean?' He said, `You're going to be going straight to the
back. Nobody is going to help you. You're a rookie. You've got that
\Ryellow\S stripe.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He explained just how tough the transition is.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavier and more powerful than the Busch cars Jones campaigned
in 88 races between 1995 and 1998, Cup cars are a handful around
tracks like the 1.54-mile AMS quadoval. But the first part of the
equation for a start-up team like Buckshot Racing is qualifying
among the top 36 on speed. Devoid of provisional starts at the
season's outset, Jones failed to qualify on speed at the Daytona
International Speedway and North Carolina Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it was just as Nadeau had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it's not just getting used to the horsepower,'' said
Jones, 28, a University of Georgia graduate and resident of Tucker,
Ga. ``Everybody's got qualifying shocks, they've got qualifying
gears or transmissions, setups, motors _ that's stuff that doesn't
really happen in the Busch series.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' early 0-for-2 has helped relegate him to third place in
points among the rookies who have started Cup races this season.
Fellow BGN graduates Tony Stewart and Elliott Sadler stand 1-2
after having qualified for every event. But because the Raybestos
Rookie of the Year is based upon a driver's best 15 finishes, Jones
has plenty of season to make his move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it'd be tough coming here to Winston Cup,'' said
Jones, a two-time BGN race-winner who will start his eighth Cup
event today in the No. 00 Crown Fiber Communications Pontiac.
``It's one of the most difficult transitions we've had to make. But
the problems we encountered were problems we never expected _ a
chassis problem, where our chassis were off a little bit. I think
we got most of that corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he qualified here with a Pontiac chassis purchased
from Hendrick Motorsports a year ago. It is one of three
Hendrick-built Grand Prixs in Jones' inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Jones started 35th and finished 29th in the Las Vegas 400 last
Sunday, five laps behind winner Jeff Burton. But Jones and his
father and car-owner, Billy Jones, were buoyed by Buckshot's
career-best hot lap at 192.654 mph. Billy Jones and his son began
the season with high expectations, in part based upon the opening
of a $2 million, 30,000 square-foot facility in Spartanburg, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot's early slips certainly have not altered Billy Jones'
long-range plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest, and probably some people will take this the
wrong way,'' said Billy Jones, a self-described ``glorified
ditch-digger'' whose profitable fiber optics construction business
is sponsoring Buckshot's car. ``If Buckshot wins a race or two this
year, it won't surprise me. I mean, I don't expect us to go out
there and run in the back of the pack by no means.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Buckshot is going to win that rookie championship. And
our intention is to run for and win the \RCup\S championship in
three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau might beg to differ. But just for today, Buckshot would
be satisfied to rack up Cup laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to run every lap,'' Jones said. ``If we can do that,
we ought to have a pretty decent finish.''
Skinner wins Busch race
</P>
<P>
   Still searching for his first career NASCAR Winston Cup victory,
Mike Skinner settled for next-best at Atlanta Motor Speedway
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner notched his first career NASCAR Busch Grand National
Series victory in the Yellow Freight 300, a race whose title
sponsor also is the primary backer of his No. 19 Chevrolet Monte
Carlo. The race was Skinner's second start for car owner David
Ridling, and only the ninth in his BGN career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a brand new team. It's pretty awesome to come out in
the second race and win for 'em,'' said Skinner, who beat
pole-sitter Dave Blaney to the flag by 2.261 seconds. ``But if it
wasn't for the guys on the 31 team helping out, we probably
wouldn't have won the race today.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to the crew on the No. 31 Lowe's Chevy that
Skinner has qualified second for today's Winston Cup Cracker Barrel
500. Cup crew chief Larry McReynolds helped put a handling package
together that cured a chronic loose condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really junk in yesterday \RFriday\S morning's
practice,'' Skinner said. ``The car had me half scared to death. We
did some different things with shocks and it ended up pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner led twice for a race-high 72 laps, including the final
41. Reigning BGN champion Dale Earnhardt Jr., finished third, his
best result in four starts this season. The third Cup regular to
win a Busch race in 1999, Skinner averaged 117.178 mph.
LAST LAPS
</P>
<P>
   Three-time Cup champion Darrell Waltrip has been forced to use
the past champion's provisional to start all four races this season
for the new team assembled by Travis Carter and Carl Haas. Under
NASCAR rules, Waltrip must attempt to qualify for the next four
events before he can use another provisional. That stretch includes
the Primestar 500 at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth on March
28.
</P>
<P>
   Reigning Cup champion Jeff Gordon (188.835 mph) topped the speed
chart during yesterday's final Happy Hour practice. He was followed
by Skinner (188.366) and rookie Tony Stewart (188.175). Pole-sitter
Bobby Labonte was 15th (187.019).

L.A. MARATHON HAS CHARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It may not be on the same level as the New York
or Boston marathons, but the 14th running of the Los Angeles
Marathon this morning will have a gritty charm all its own.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 20,000 runners are scheduled to compete in the
26.2-mile annual endurance race, and several thousand others will
participate in a variety of related events that include a bicycle
tour and wheelchair race.
</P>
<P>
   It all begins promptly at 8:40 a.m. The elites will finish about
2 hours later, but the bulk of the contestants should have crossed
the finish line by 2:30 p.m., organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be an interesting race,'' said John Tope, the
marathon's lead athlete coordinator. ``The field is deep and better
than in the past, so we should have some fast times.''
</P>
<P>
   The course starts with a run south along Figueroa Blvd. to
Martin Luther King Blvd. After a jaunt along Exposition, the
runners will turn north on Crenshaw and go east for a bit before
crossing Wilshire Boulevard at New Hampshire Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The pack will head north to Hollywood, travel to Sunset, then
south on Virgil to Wilshire. The group will cross the finish line
at Flower, just south of 5th St.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, runners will see USC, the Crenshaw District,
Koreatown, Hollywood and the Civic Center. And, about 1.2 million
people in the various communities will line the streets to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say that today's race may be a bit more special than
in years past because it features five male runners whose personal
best times are faster than the course record.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the elite men's field are Kenyans Simon Bor (2:08:46),
John Kipkosgei (2:09:54) and Simon Kirwa (2:10:17), Taye Moges
(2:09:21) of Ethiopia and Russia's Leonid Shvestov (2:09:16). Each
is looking to break the mark of 2:10:19 set by Mexico's Martin
Mondragon in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's division, two-time champion Lornah Kiplagat of
Kenya (2:33:50) will try to win her third consecutive. She'll be
challenged by Kenyan Hellen Kimaiyo-Kipkosgei (2:29:45) and Alena
Peterkova (2:25:19) of the Czech Republic. Madina Bitktagirova of
Belarus holds the course record of 2:26:23 set in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the marathon is allowing 20,000 entries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the growing field of runners, $5,000 has been
added to the first-place finisher's prize. The male and female
winners will each get $35,000 and a new Honda Accord.
</P>
<P>
   And in the sometimes snobby world of marathons run in Boston,
New York and Chicago, Los Angeles is gaining newfound respect among
runners, Tope said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap's definitely closed,'' Tope said. ``We've been fourth,
but it was a distant fourth. Now, it's a lot closer than it has
been. It's very tough to displace Boston and New York.''

SMALL PLANES, STUDENT PILOTS COME UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're the Yugos of the skies above Sky Harbor International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Small aircraft, especially those with student pilots at the
controls, are the bane of air-traffic controllers and many
commercial pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The ``little guys,'' in return, bristle at the suggestion that
they can't claim a piece of the sky. They say they're singled out
for unnecessarily harsh treatment from controllers and often
required to circle needlessly above the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Controllers are lobbying to get student pilots banned from Sky
Harbor. They argue that 12 U.S. airports, eight of them less busy
than Phoenix, have such restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, they say, fewer small aircraft in Sky Harbor's busy
airspace would make operations safer for all.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA, which governs the skies over the airport, sees no
need to shoo away the little guys.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic is carefully monitored, with an envelope of space built
in around each aircraft, said William Shumann, an FAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Any airport that receives federal grant money _ and Sky Harbor
certainly is one of them _ must accept all users, Shumann said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA allowed the student-pilot bans because of the level of
traffic and the complexity of the airspace at those 12 airports,
Shumann said. The FAA does not believe Sky Harbor meets those
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Still, smaller aircraft were at fault in 26 of 38 pilot-error
reports filed by local FAA officials in a 10-month period last
year. Only four were the fault of commercial pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining incidents were controller errors or involved
vehicles driving onto the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The tension over the small-airplane issue bubbles up in reports
on airport problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception by air-traffic controllers of `little airplane,
big airplane' continues to put the small guys in the ranks of
second-class citizens,'' an unidentified small-aircraft pilot wrote
in a report filed through the federal Aviation Safety Reporting
System.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot complained that air-traffic controllers ignored his
radio call in favor of larger, commercial aircraft, forcing the
smaller plane to climb higher as his plane neared South Mountain.
In the report, the pilot asserted this was part of a campaign to
neglect small aircrafts' needs so they wouldn't bother flying into
Sky Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Controllers return the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   In an unrelated account also filed with the safety reporting
system, a controller complained that a Cessna piloted by a student
did not respond to tower instructions after takeoff. As a result,
controllers ordered a Boeing 737 off the runway, fearing the Cessna
might turn back.
</P>
<P>
   The student pilot claimed his radio had malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a common occurrence with student pilots operating at
this airport,'' the controller wrote. He concluded that student
pilots should be banned and listed other airports where this is
done.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, filed with the National Aeronautic Space
Administration, are scrubbed clean of identifying details, such as
the complainants' names or airlines, before being made public. NASA
cautions that its system is self-reporting, which makes the
accounts vulnerable to subjective reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot-deviation reports are a more reliable indicator of
trouble. The reports are filed by FAA tower officials to document
what they believe are pilot errors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18 months from February 1996 to August 1997, the FAA
filed 35 such reports from Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But the pace picked up in late 1997. In 10 months, from December
1997 to October 1998, tower officials filed 38 reports. More than
two-thirds of them involved smaller aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Some documented harrowing events, such as on Feb. 7, 1998, when
a Rockwell AC-12 ignored tower instructions and entered the north
runway, forcing an arriving Southwest Airlines jet to abort a
landing and do another turn over the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the reports detail that the pilot was a student.
On Dec. 30, 1997, a Sawyer student ignored instructions to taxi
behind an America West Boeing 737. That forced the 737 to instead
follow the student.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 26 reports involving small aircraft documented
intrusions into Phoenix's airspace without clearance. None of those
cases resulted in any problems, and several of them occurred miles
away from Sky Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   George Sullivan, air-traffic manager of the Phoenix tower,
chalked up many of the reports to pilot inexperience with Sky
Harbor. But that doesn't make the case for banning them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What will move more of the ``little guys'' out, he said, is the
airport's increasingly busy traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are seven times each day that general-aviation
aircraft have to wait for takeoffs and landings. Traffic is just
too thick to let the small planes in immediately, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these things start to happen, they decide it's better to
use Deer Valley (Airport) or Falcon Field because they don't want
to hold out there for 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, general-aviation travel has been dropping at Sky
Harbor. Last year, 15 percent of the airport's traffic came from
general aviation. A decade ago, it was 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the decrease, controllers warn of the potential hazards
of small aircraft and student pilots. Their warnings have struck
some nerves.
</P>
<P>
   To Darrell Sawyer, owner of the only flight school left at Sky
Harbor, the controllers wield more influence on airport access than
the FAA or the airport's owners at Phoenix City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing hinges on what happens in the tower cab, which
is dictated by David Stock,'' said Sawyer, referring to the
president of the local air-traffic controllers' union.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to admit that the union has that much power hurts, but
it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer said shoddy treatment by air-traffic controllers is
driving his customers to suburban airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love the service, they love the airplanes, but it's too
difficult for them to get in and out of Sky Harbor,'' said Sawyer,
owner of Sawyer Aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Stock said there's no campaign to squeeze out small planes. In
fact, since controllers now work on a system that links pay to
volume, they would be taking money out of their pockets if they
needlessly turned away traffic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   `I haven't been shy in talking about mistakes, I guess,'' he
said. ``And more mistakes are made by small planes than by big
planes. We want to keep mistakes to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer, at the request of city aviation officials, said he will
drop primary training when his lease renews in 2002. That will
remove beginners from Sky Harbor's airspace.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's debating whether to open a primary-training school
elsewhere. But, he said, his students will miss out on the rich
experience that busy Sky Harbor, with its mix of air operations,
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that letting beginners roam the skies above Sky
Harbor is like letting a driver's ed student maneuver through the
I-17/I-10 stack interchange at rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   To Tom Browning, a former Luke Air Force Base commander, it's
daunting to face the prospect of flying near aircraft that are
piloted by ``Joe Six Pack, who has more money than brains, who goes
out and gets 40 hours of training.''
</P>
<P>
   But the best antidote, he said, is vigilance, not bans.
</P>
<P>
   Single-engine pilot Darrin Strosnider said he's never had
trouble flying into Sky Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   He chalks that up to doing his homework _ being up to the minute
on weather conditions and the frequencies used by the tower. Pilots
who aren't prepared for Sky Harbor's busy conditions don't deserve
to be there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Strosnider said he has little desire to use an airport where
small aircraft are going to have to wait behind the big guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I avoid it for that very reason: They have a lot of heavies
going in and out of there, and they get the priority,'' he said. &QL;

UP TO SCRATCH: INDIANS OF SOUTHERN ARIZONA LOVE THE DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BETTY BEARD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The traditional Native American dance looks nothing like its
name, and no one seems to know why.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken scratch. It's a dance that resembles a slow polka,
Western two-step or free-style rumba, not a barnyard animal pecking
at the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Joaquin, leader of the popular Southern Scratch band and a
second-generation chicken scratch musician, knows two versions of
how the 120-year-old dance got its name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first way was that, when Anglos saw us dancing, we kind of
scrunched over with our heels back, and we resembled chickens
scratching in the dirt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've also heard that our people have seen Anglos dancing, and
that's what they resembled.''
</P>
<P>
   Confusion over its name aside, chicken scratch has enticed
generation after generation of Native Americans in southern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken scratch is the dance of choice in isolated desert
communities in the area from the Mexican border to Scottsdale,
remaining a fixture at festivals, weddings, birthday parties, queen
coronations and death anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a favorite pastime out here, even for little kids,'' said
Gena Enos, while listening to the Santa Rosa Band play on the first
night of the Gila River Indian Community's major Mul-Chu-Tha fair
recently in Sacaton.
</P>
<P>
   Along with its own footwork, the dance even has its own music.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken scratch is a blend of European and Mexican music that
the Tohono O'odham Indians and Akimel O'odham, or Pima, Indians
melded into a peppy sound, without vocals or words.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Tohono O'odham Nation, however, consider chicken
scratch an old-fashioned and, at times, an insulting term. They
call their music and dance ``waila,'' which comes from ``baile,''
the Spanish word for dance.
</P>
<P>
   One musician said that in the O'odham language, a ``b'' is
pronounced as a ``w,'' thus waila.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Gila River and Salt River Indian communities south
and east of the Phoenix area, it's proudly called chicken scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Like the debate over its name, the dance keeps going and going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like mainstream pop,'' said Steve Butler of Canyon
Records, a Phoenix company that specializes in Native American
music. ``This little art form is still cranking out bands, songs
and music. New generations are playing it. There's something
there,''
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix company has produced 56 chicken scratch albums since
the 1970s, including a 1994 chicken scratch Christmas album that
reached a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, most buyers are Indians who live in
southern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he believes one reason the dance music survives is
that southern Arizona Indians, like other West Coast tribes,
generally keep to themselves, thus protecting their cultural
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   As Tucson folklorist Jim Griffith explained, ``Once the O'odhams
get something, they like to hang on to it. They like to keep doing
it. It's been so long in their culture that they feel it's their
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for its staying power is more basic. The dance
and music are just fun.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Jackson, 28, a fitness specialist at the Gila River
Indian Community's Wellness Center in Sacaton and a chicken
scratcher, explained, ``It has a happy, let's-dance atmosphere to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She estimates at least 40 percent of the Gila River Indians'
young people are fans of chicken scratch. They're also into
hip-hop, heavy metal, rhythm and blues, and country-Western.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is teaching her fiance, Leslie Enos, 23, to do the
chicken scratch. Dressed in baggy pants and carrying a skateboard,
he doesn't look like someone who would learn a dance named after a
bird. But Jackson wants him to do a chicken scratch dance at their
wedding, so learn he will.
</P>
<P>
   Today the three major scratch-dancing styles are the two-step,
one-step and the Caribbean-style cumbia, which is especially
popular among young adults and teens. The two-step dances are
similar to a slow polka, with an unhurried tempo for the summer
when it's too hot to dance fast.
</P>
<P>
   Ferma Howard, who also teaches chicken scratch at the Wellness
Center, said the two-step gives students the most problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's two (steps) to the left, and two to the right,'' Howard
said. ``Then you learn the technique of how to turn at the same
time and make sure you don't step on anyone's toes.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Jackson said, ``If you have a good dance partner, you
can't go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three styles, nothing fills the dance floor like the
cumbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are into cumbia,'' Joaquin said. ``They sort of like
the Latin beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because cumbia dancers can do whatever they want and don't
need lessons _ or partners. All the dancers move in a circle
counterclockwise. Parents and grandparents dance with children, or
children dance alone.
</P>
<P>
   At a Friendship Fun Days festival recently in Stanfield, the
floor remained empty until Southern Scratch broke into cumbia
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people hear cumbia music, they say, `Cumbia!' and go,
`Yahoo!' '' Jackson said. Sometimes the floor is so crowded,
dancers barely have room to move. They really get to screaming.
They have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   From a musician's point of view, chicken scratch or waila music
is a hoot to play but a lot of work, Joaquin said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people of the Tohono O'odham Nation, where chicken
scratch reigns, dances sometimes last until morning. Joaquin, 36,
who lives near Florence, said he has played for dances, with as
many as four bands present, from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done it by ourselves from 8 to 6, with two 15-minute
breaks,'' Joaquin said. ``People keep honking their horns when we
take a break more than 15 minutes. They won't stop until we start
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Waila musicians play from memory and don't read music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird because nobody reads music. . . . It was three
years ago that I learned that on a piano the black keys were sharps
or flats,'' Joaquin said.
</P>
<P>
   Their lack of formal training doesn't cramp their style,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the bands can play all night without repeating a
song,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians tend to grow up with the music, with waila and
chicken scratch musicians running in families.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin's grandfather played fiddle, his father led the Joaquin
Brothers waila band and his teenage son is a member of the Young
Waila Musicians band.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken scratch evolved from old-style fiddle music played in
the 1800s. Griffith, of the Southwest Folklore Center at the
University of Arizona, said he read of a Tohono O'odham (then
called Papago) old-style fiddle band playing waltz-type mazurkas
and schottisches and other polka-inspired European dances in Tucson
in 1860.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Indians lived in or near Mexico, the music eventually
took on a Mexican flair, with a Norteno influence and the
introduction of the cumbia. Also in the 1950s and 1960s, most
O'odham old-time fiddle scratch bands switched from acoustical
instruments to electric guitars, saxophones and accordions.
</P>
<P>
   Today a band generally includes an alto saxophone and accordion
to play the melody, with electric guitars and drums in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 20 bands on the Tohono O'odham Nation alone.
</P>
<P>
   Popular melodies have evolved over the years to feature
everything from ``Turkey in the Straw'' to songs by Selena. Joaquin
said the old Western song ``Ghostriders in the Sky'' is one of the
most requested.
</P>
<P>
   For southern Arizona Indians, chicken scratch is a staple of
celebrations, one of the state's little-known cultural exports.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin has performed at Carnegie Hall in New York City as well
as at folk festivals in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said the music ``is not much of a scene in other
tribes.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Others may have two-step dances, but they're not
called chicken scratch. It really belongs to the people of southern
Arizona deserts.'' &QL;

LAKERS EMBARK ON TOUGH TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Six games in six cities in nine days. On paper
alone, it's enough to make an NBA veteran's tendinitis flare up.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in three time zones, two sets of back-to-back games in the
last five days, jumping from Cleveland to Philadelphia to Orlando
to Dallas, contending along the way with guys named Brandon and
Iverson and Hardaway . . . and, well, suddenly the lockout didn't
seem so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tough stretch,'' 37-year-old Derek Harper said of
the Lakers' toughest road trip of the season, which begins today in
Sacramento. ``Personally, I have to keep massage therapists in
business on this road trip. That's the only way I'm gonna get
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Between Saturday, when the Lakers left town, and next Monday
night, March 22, the team will cover 6,795 miles, hitting both
coasts and several climate changes. Their 10-game winning streak
won't just be tested, it could be outright negated if the Lakers
blink too hard.
</P>
<P>
   And they don't exactly enter this gauntlet at full strength.
Harper and Kobe Bryant have sore ankles, Robert Horry suffered
dizziness Friday _ perhaps thinking about the schedule? _ and
Dennis Rodman has left the team for undisclosed reasons, for an
undetermined period.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like fun? It all depends on your perspective, and the date
stamped on your birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   !ital!Six games in six cities in nine days?!off! No big deal to
the 20-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw man, you're making it sound hard,'' Bryant said to the
reporter droning on about the details. !ital!It looks hard.!off!
``It looks !ital!fun!off!.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, youth. Bryant fully embraces the compacted schedule, which
will take him home to Philadelphia on Friday. With the Lakers
having recently added reinforcements in Glen Rice and J.R. Reid,
without a loss since Feb. 23, everything sounds fun to the
exuberant Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having so much fun playing, so I think it's gonna be a
fun road trip to go out and compete every night, especially because
it is our only big road trip,'' he said. ``You're going up against
Eastern Conference teams and they're going to be looking forward to
playing you, beating your butt. So you gotta be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than accomplished. The Lakers start slowly, a game
tonight against the Kings, then a day off before playing at
Minneapolis on Tuesday, then another off day.
</P>
<P>
   Then it gets exhausting. They play Thursday in Cleveland, hop on
the team charter plane, get to Philadelphia sometime after midnight
Friday, play again that night, then take a day off before an
afternoon game in Orlando _ just 36 hours after the final buzzer in
Philly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tiring, without a doubt,'' Harper said. ``But I
think the fact that we have a lot of depth on our team will come
into play. More guys are obviously gonna have to play and hopefully
everybody that plays will step up and do things that need to be
done to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, no easy task considering the opponents. Minnesota is 8-1
at Target Center, Orlando is 10-1 at home. The Sixers are 12-8,
winning seven of their past 10. Even the Kings, struggling of late,
have a winning record at home. The only soft opponent is Dallas,
and the Mavericks catch the Lakers for Game 6, a day after playing
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna be tough, especially that Dallas game,'' Bryant
said. ``That's a game that you really can't sleep on. (If you
lose), you'll look back at the end of the season like, `Damn, we
might have missed having home-court advantage (in the playoffs)
because of that game.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For rookie coach Kurt Rambis, the challenge is to maximize the
12-man roster, or 11 if Rodman skips the entire trip. But he still
has to play his starters enough to win each night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna find out what the team is made of,'' Rambis said.
``Nobody said it was gonna be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only my third year, and by the time we hit Cleveland
Thursday night and going into Philly Friday night on the
back-to-back, that makes it harder to chase a guy like (Allen)
Iverson around,'' Derek Fisher said. ``But we accept the challenge.
And we expect to win every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Just keep the massage therapists and trainers close by.

LOS ANGELES: most successful IPOs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Xylan IPO was a wakeup call to entrepreneurs, venture
capital and investment bankers that Southern California was now on
the map,'' said co-founder Douglas Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing and selling arcane equipment used to direct voice
and data flow over phone and computer network lines, Xylan has
flourished with the recent explosion of the Internet and corporate
intranets. So much so, in fact, that earlier this month France's
Alcatel SA agreed to buy Xylan for about $2 billion, by far the
biggest takeover of a local telecom firm to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xylan is really the major success story for Southern
California,'' observed Cliff Numark, a program director at the
nonprofit Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance, which works to
attract high-tech firms to the area.
</P>
<P>
   News last week that the German industrial conglomerate Siemens
would buy a 20 percent stake in Accelerated Networks, a privately
held Moorpark firm, has further legitimized the region as a telecom
comer.
</P>
<P>
   The trick now, industry participants say, is to sustain and
build on the area's newfound favor. The cost of land and housing
should help. In recruiting employees, local firms can typically
offer less than, say, a Santa Clara company and still manage to
land top talent. With the same money, ``you can buy twice the house
here that you could in Santa Clara,'' said Xylan's Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital is also far easier to come by than just a few
years ago, said LARTA's Numark. Venture funding for information
technology _ led by telecom _ has grown by roughly 1,000 percent in
the past five years, he said, to more than $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, whether the local telecom industry can maintain and
improve its position relative to competitors will depend on how
large local players can grow. In a theme played out in industries
across Los Angeles, as local firms reach a certain level of success
they are often snatched up by deep-pocketed competitors. And for
many, that's not necessarily bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these companies are building gear that in the long
run makes more sense to plug into a larger-selling organization
like a Cisco, Lucent or Nortel,'' said Xircom's Gates. ``We're
probably not a big acquisition target at the moment, but that could
change. If the big guys decide they want (mobile computing) as part
of their strategy, we become a target.''
</P>
<P>
   Others pooh-pooh the notion, insisting they will be the hunter,
not the hunted. Vertel, a company based in the Woodland Hills
community in the San Fernando Valley that makes software to manage
telecommunications networks, recently bought the parent company
from which it spun off just three years ago, and last year it
acquired a San Diego competitor for $3million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that acquisition, we had $20 million cash,'' said
Vertel Vice President Ruth Cox. ``We're looking to build a sizable
company ... and have no intention of being bought. We're the ones
doing the sniffing.''

STARS, FLYERS COULD OFFER FINALS PRELUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ NHL experts have predicted since the All-Star
break that the Stars and Philadelphia Flyers are favorites to meet
in the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, be sure to fire up the VCR tonight, because
this is the only scouting tape that will be available on this
matchup all season. The NHL's move to six divisions has left
several teams with one meeting each season.
</P>
<P>
   So, does that put any extra emphasis on the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``It's a
national TV game \RESPN\S, and they're a handful. They might be the
best team in the league from the red line in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers boast the most offensively successful line in the NHL
with Eric Lindros (89 points), John LeClair (81 points) and newly
acquired winger Mark Recchi. Lindros and LeClair are a combined
plus 67 and tied for the NHL lead in goal scoring with 38 goals
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair missed the Flyers game against the Penguins yesterday
with a hip-flexor injury, but said he would like to play tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great line,'' Hitchcock said. ``I don't think we can
check them with just one line, it'll have to be a combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Mike Modano combined with linemates Jamie
Langenbrunner and Jere Lehtinen to shut down one of the hottest
lines in the league Friday when they held Anaheim's Teemu Selanne,
Paul Kariya and Steve Rucchin without a point. But while the Modano
line suffocated the Ducks' speed, they'll have a different
challenge against a burly line led by the 6-foot-4, 230-pound
Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers are riding a 10-game (0-7-3) winless streak, their
longest of the 1990s. They lost to the Penguins, 4-0, yesterday in
Pittsburgh and have fallen from the first playoff seed to the fifth
in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to the Stars going 13-3-3 against the East this season
and 12-2-2 in their past 16 games, and the matchup becomes even
bigger for the Flyers, who recently traded promising young prospect
Dainius Zubrus to the Montreal Canadiens for goal-scoring winger
Recchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you've got to quit hoping for a break and go out there
and make something happen,'' LeClair said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Stars and Flyers will get only one chance to do
that this season.

RANGERS' BURKETT ENDURES ROUGH STRETCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Johnny Paul 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates, who often
guards his personal expectations for individual players with locked
lips, offered this bold prediction three weeks ago:
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect John Burkett to win at least 15 games this year.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be a stretch if the 34-year-old right-hander cannot
solve his _ his stretch, that is.
</P>
<P>
   That deficiency reared its head in the Rangers' 13-7 victory
against the Detroit Tigers yesterday at Charlotte County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, who struggles when forced to pitch from the stretch
instead of from the windup, became the subject of torment once the
Tigers produced base runners.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a five-run second inning for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really trying to work on that this spring, but I struggled
with it again,'' Burkett said. ``The only thing you can do is keep
working and keep grinding.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents punished Burkett with the big inning throughout 1998.
Opposing lineups scored three or more runs in an inning 19 times
against Burkett in his 32 starts. One base runner often ignites a
chain reaction of hitter-friendly pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Opening Day 1998?
</P>
<P>
   Burkett retired the first 12 batters the Chicago White Sox sent
to the plate, but seven runs scored before the completion of the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, a ``contact'' pitcher who cannot overpower hitters and
allows opponents to put the ball in play, surrenders hits.
Opponents hit .292 against Burkett in 1998, but batting averages
soar once runners reach.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents hit .347 with runners on base and .353 with runners in
scoring position; those two figures ranked as the fifth-and
third-worst among American League qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   Those type of batting averages tend to lead to big innings and
big trouble for a member of the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've gotten into a bad habit of rushing when pitching
from the stretch,'' Burkett said. ``Your natural tendency is rush
your delivery with men on base, but I don't have to. I've got the
best catcher in the history of baseball \RIvan Rodriguez\S behind
the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates and general manager Doug Melvin have reiterated their
belief that Burkett can regain the form that saw him go 67-42 with
a 3.82 earned-run average in five seasons with the San Francisco
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people from the outside might think they're crazy, but I
don't see any reason why I can't get it done if I make the correct
adjustments here and there,'' said Burkett, who went 9-13 with a
5.68 ERA in 1998. ``I believe I can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates does, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very capable of pitching like he did in Anaheim last
year,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers completed a three-game sweep of the Angels after
Burkett's Sept. 23 start. The Angels managed only one run and two
hits against Burkett in his eight-inning appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty big game he pitched for us,'' Oates said.
``He's capable of doing that 15 times this year.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   It might not, though, if Burkett solves his.

STRIKE DEADLINE NEAR FOR AMWEST FLIGHT ATTENDANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pay dispute between flight attendants and America West
Airlines, smoldering since the company's 1991 financial meltdown,
has left negotiators with just 59 hours to defuse the animosity and
work out a deal before Friday's strike deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Though there have been signs of hope for a settlement, the 2,400
flight attendants are toting some heavy baggage born of America
West's bankruptcy filing seven years ago. The Tempe-based carrier
cut their pay 10 percent and left them holding worthless stock in
its reorganization _ stock that the flight attendants were forced
to buy with salaries as little as $12,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the company posting record profits of $108.6 million
last year, the Association of Flight Attendants Council 66 is
adamant that the company can improve its offer, and as a result,
make up for lost time and pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The members want the company to put dollars on the table that
show a commitment to the future and sacrifices of the past,'' union
President Bill McGlashen said.
</P>
<P>
   Although acknowledging the financial turmoil the flight
attendants have endured, Greg Garger, America West vice president
of labor relations, said it is something that all the airline's
employee groups had to withstand and their pay cuts have been
restored.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of emotion attached to that, but the focus now
has to be on reaching a settlement, said Garger, who will be one of
the company's lead negotiators along with management labor
consultant Jerry Glass.
</P>
<P>
   The two will begin meetings with McGlashen and his AFA team
Wednesday afternoon at the National Mediation Board offices in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   If a contract settlement eludes them, the flight attendants can
strike at the end of the day Friday _ 10:01 p.m. in Arizona and
just after midnight on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But they're not necessarily in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   America West also can exercise its option of locking out
employees and shutting down the airline, which it has warned
employees it will consider.
</P>
<P>
   Random strikes that the union calls CHAOS _ Create Havoc Around
Our System _ or a lockout could cripple spring travel at Phoenix
Sky Harbor International Airport, where America West accounts for
more than 40 percent of the takeoffs and landings. With CHAOS, the
flight attendants' union plans to target selected flights at the
last minute instead of a complete walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers would be left scrambling for limited seats on other
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes also are high in terms of how a strike would affect
morale among the flight attendants, who have the largest union
membership at America West and who are the company's front-line
employees. Some passengers already have complained that the dispute
has affected how flight attendants are treating passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants, who are prohibited by company policy to talk
to the media, say they are eager to reach agreement on their first
contract, which they've been awaiting since voting for a union in
1994. Longtime flight attendants talk about how they paid a steep
price to keep the company aloft during reorganization, and many
vent their anger toward management, especially Chairman William
Franke.
</P>
<P>
   It's a grudge that some suggest could be a huge stumbling block
to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Airline analyst Sam Buttrick of PaineWebber in New York said the
financial differences can be worked out, but the emotional gulf may
be harder to bridge, making a strike inevitable. &QL; 
Like `unwanted in-law' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants, two-thirds of whom have 10 to 16 years'
experience with America West, feel ``like the unwanted in-law who
stayed too long, said Jeff Zack, AFA communications director.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've brought this company back to being successful,'' he
said, adding that flight attendants are willing to fight for a
better deal than the company has offered.
</P>
<P>
   The union wants America West to up its ante by $16.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Short of that, it would be futile to reach a tentative
settlement because the flight attendants won't accept a deal that
doesn't include significant improvements in salary, travel expenses
and other pay issues, according to Zack.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants rejected a tentative agreement of $53.5
million in December 1997 over similar issues.
</P>
<P>
   America West, guarded in its public comments heading into this
week's eleventh-hour negotiations, remains hopeful it can negotiate
a contract the union will accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what our objective is and that is an agreement that's
fair to flight attendants, fair to the company and consistent to
our deals with other employees,'' Garger said.
</P>
<P>
   America West has negotiated first contracts with its pilots
union, dispatchers and mechanics, but there were some bitter
negotiations, especially with the Teamsters-represented mechanics,
who settled in October. &QL; 
1st strike deadline &QL; 
The difference in this case is that the company has never faced a
strike deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Garger declined to comment on whether that will change the
dynamics of the negotiations, saying it would only be speculation
on his part.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators expect long sessions from Wednesday through Friday
night to resolve the remaining differences, and both sides say
they're willing to extend the talks if progress is being made.
</P>
<P>
   America West has proposed a salary scale of $16.13 per hour to
start and $34.59 after 15 years. The union is pushing for industry
average pay of starting pay of $15.11 per hour, topping out at
$39.50 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   AFA leaders say that they have scaled back their proposal from
$129 million to $74.5 million but that the company's offer is still
$16.5 million short. &QL; 
Gap in dispute &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America West values its proposal at $68.7 million, suggesting
that the two sides are only $5.8 million apart, or just $1.16
million per year over the five years of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the average salary increase would total 44.7
percent over five years.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to flight attendants, Franke said the union is
holding out for wages and benefits matching the larger airlines,
which is something that America West cannot do and remain
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA disputes that, saying America West would still enjoy a
labor cost advantage if it met the union's demands.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendant labor costs as a percentage of operating
revenue were about about 2.6 percent last year, with the
next-closest Southwest Airlines at 4.7 percent, according to Zack.
</P>
<P>
   As a low-cast carrier, America West seems blindly focused on
keeping labor costs down, while ignoring other ways to shave costs,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For America West, the bottom line is keeping its costs low in
light of the fact that, because of its size, revenue is far below
the top six airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it would lose $250 million a year if its labor
costs equaled those of the six biggest U.S. carriers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the union, the rallying cry, painted on banners and across
car windows is: ``Pay us or CHAOS.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the sniping that has strained relations between flight
attendants and the company, the question remains whether
negotiators in the final days of talks can put aside their
differences and find points of agreement that can keep the flight
attendants and America West's planes in the air. &QL;

LOS ANGELES' SAN FERNANDO VALLEY BECOMING HOTBED OF
TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACTIVITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Silicon Valley of telephones it ain't. At
least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   But news earlier this month that two European telecommunications
giants are buying into local firms has highlighted the fact that
Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley and its surrounding suburbs have
become a hotbed of telecom activity.
</P>
<P>
   But why here, and why now? Depending on who's talking, credit
goes to everything from the breakup of AT&AMP;T to the decline of
aerospace to the region's relative abundance of commercial and
residential property. In fact, all have played important roles,
helped along by a booming economy and a dollop of pure luck.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that, along with places like Boston, the
Dallas-Richardson corridor and Santa Clara County, the Ventura
Freeway corridor has become a cluster zone for small and midsize
firms supplying products and manpower to the booming fields of
corporate networking, the Internet and dial-tone phone service,
generating annual sales of more than $1.5 billion in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a unique opportunity in the San Fernando
Valley,'' said Bill Kula, a spokesman for Dallas-based GTE Corp.,
which maintains a regional headquarters in Thousand Oaks. ``The
seeds are being planted there to create a true
telecommunications-data networking corridor.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Silicon Valley, which dominates the nation's computer
software industry, no single city or region has a lock on
telecommunications. Indeed, the breakup of AT&AMP;T in 1984 created
seven Baby Bells scattered across the country and around which
distinct telecom industries developed.
</P>
<P>
   While it's possible a single region may one day take precedence
or, conversely, even more clusters will appear, ``As it stands,
it's as if imaginary fences have been drawn,'' divvying up the
country, Kula said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Pacific Telesis _ later bought by SBC
Communications _ was the post-Ma Bell mother lode around which
vendors grew. Though San Francisco-based, more than half of the
company's customers were and are in Southern California, requiring
major local infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   On the data networking front, for example, companies like Micom
Communications in Simi Valley and Fibermuxin Chatsworth developed
equipment to link the stand-alone computers of Pacific Telesis'
corporate customers to networks, and fiber-optic lines to then
allow those networked machines to rapidly exchange data with each
other. The Micoms and Fibermuxins in turn spawned more firms, as
did spending cutbacks at aerospace contractors such as Rockwell,
Hughes and TRW.
</P>
<P>
   High-speed computer-chip maker Vitesse Semiconductor in
Camarillo, for one, was founded in 1984 by two former Rockwell
employees with a good idea and gumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rockwell was doing a lot of government work with gallium
arsenide integrated circuits, and two of our founders had developed
a way to make these things more manufacturable,'' said spokeswoman
Trisha Ito. ``They presented the idea to Rockwell, which passed,
and these guys said, Let's see if we can do it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   After searching for seed money and finding it in a large
sandpaper manufacturer with too much cash on its hands, the pair
did just that. The relationship with Norton Sandpaper eventually
soured during an early sales slump, but a new round of venture
capital and, later, a successful initial public offering put
Vitesse on a track that has seen its revenues grow to more than
$175 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in the Woodland Hills community of the San Fernando
Valley _ then further up the Ventura Freeway to Calabasas, then
further up again to Newbury Park _ Xircom Corp. was striking out in
yet another direction, pursuing the burgeoning field of mobile
computing. Founded in 1988 by California State University,
Northridge, graduate Dirk Gates, Xircom was an early developer of
modems for portable PCs and now makes what are regarded as the top
products in their category.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xircom is still probably unique among the (telecom) companies
out here,'' Gates said. ``We're not building the (infrastructure)
tree, but the leaves at the end of the tree.'' Today the company
sells more than $270 million worth of modems and related devices
annually.
</P>
<P>
   But even as such early players were making a go of it, by the
mid-1990s there was still no real groundswell, no spark that
indicated to local participants and the world at large that the
region was destined to be a major player in the telecommunications
field.
</P>
<P>
   That changed when two immigrants, a marketing whiz and a
tech-head, took their Calabasas-based company, Xylan, public. The
initial public offering generated $130 million, making it one of
the year's most successful IPOs.

DETROIT GOES QUIETLY THIS TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Detroit Mercy stuck a corkscrew in UCLA's gut
Thursday night, then turned it another rotation Saturday against
Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   A Titans victory would have substantiated their first-round
upset _ or at least made it easier to accept in Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Detroit departed with a whimper, losing 75-44 to the
No. 4 seed Buckeyes before 32,758 in the RCA Dome. The Titans lost
in the second round for the second straight season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohio State and UCLA are really a lot alike,'' Detroit guard
Rashad Phillips said. ``We were flat against Ohio State, and they
fed on our flatness. We were timid, and they used that to their
advantage. We were thinking about what was at stake, the Sweet
16.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes (25-6) did everything UCLA did not.
</P>
<P>
   They established control early and grabbed a 12-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   They contained Detroit's guards, Phillips and Jermaine Jackson,
and contested every shot.
</P>
<P>
   They had a 51-25 rebounding advantage, and they executed against
Detroit's tenacious defense _ shooting 59 percent in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense prevailed in the UCLA game, but not today,''
Detroit forward Bacari Alexander said. ``Ohio State put the ball in
the basket, and UCLA did not. That's it. There's no magic potion.''
</P>
<P>
   When Detroit tried the 2-3 zone that confounded UCLA, the
Buckeyes carved it up. They made 10 of 21 shots from 3-point range,
and they scored 28 points in the lane. (UCLA had 14.) Smooth
swingman Michael Reed and point guard Scoonie Penn combined for 30
points; Penn, who is 5-foot-10, grabbed 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally came upon a team that isn't bigger than us,'' Penn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State held Detroit scoreless for nearly 10 minutes and took
a 25-12 lead into the locker room. The Buckeyes broke it open early
in the second half with a 15-6 surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were terrific defensively,'' Buckeyes coach Jim O'Brien
said. ``When we looked at tapes of Detroit, I thought Phillips is
as good as a lot of the guards we played this year. We were able to
keep him under double figures.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes now face No. 1 seed Auburn on Thursday in a Sweet
16 matchup of previously dormant programs. It's Ohio State's first
Sweet 16 since the Jimmy Jackson-led team in 1992, which was also
its last tournament appearance. Auburn hasn't played in the Sweet
16 since 1986 with Chuck Person.

MOYA BEATS KUERTEN; WILLIAMS DEFEATS GRAF  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIAN WELLS, Calif. _ It took a little bit of prayer and a lot
of topspin, but Carlos Moya, the shaggy-haired Spaniard who
announced himself as an impact player by capturing last year's
French Open, Saturday became the first man from his nation, and the
15th man ever, to attain the No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   With the desert sun serving as a natural spotlight, Moya
replaced the slumping Pete Sampras at the top of the standing when
he defeated Gustavo Kuerten, 6-3, 1-6, 6-1, to reach the final of
the Newsweek Champions Cup. It was Kuerten who preceded Moya as the
French Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be king,'' said Moya, whose history-making
semifinal victory was followed by another bravura breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, 17, currently the queen of the women's tennis
scene, stormed to her second consecutive title, and collected
$200,000, by ousting the two-time champion Steffi Graf, 6-3, 3-6,
7-5, in the final of the Evert Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can win the big ones now,'' said Williams, who is
unbeaten in her last 11 matches. ``That's enough to win a Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams had bragged of possessing the best forehand on the tour
on the eve of this final, and Saturday, despite falling behind a
service break after the first game of the third set, she used it,
along with nine aces, to deny the 29-year-old Graf a 107th career
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about this,'' said Williams, who sprinted
from the court to hug her father and coach, Richard; her auxiliary
coach, Nick Bollettieri, and the Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan,
who owns the WTA Tour's international television rights and last
week treated Williams and her older sister, Venus, to a screen
test. Back on court, Williams complimented Graf for making life
difficult for her in the midday sunshine, but Graf made it clear
that Williams, who pounded out 35 winners while Graf had just 11,
deserved the title for being the more aggressive player despite her
inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just going for her shots more than I did and that was
the difference at the end,'' said Graf, who surrendered her
third-set service break with a netted backhand in the eighth game.
Serving at 5-6, Graf plopped a forehand into the net to set up
double match point for Williams, then soared a forehand long to
give Williams her second title in as many finals. Graf had not lost
a final since the 1994 U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   After his victory, Moya proclaimed himself not just the king of
the world computer ranking, but the king of the world _ ``at least
for a week,'' said the 22-year-old Moya, a self-described lazybones
from Majorca who does his share of Walter Mitty fantasizing and has
even dreamed his way into a Wimbledon final. ``I was the king of
clay, and now I've been king of the world,'' said Moya, who
anticipated a message from King Juan Carlos of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the king of Spain, but he's talking about tennis; he's
going to be happy,'' Moya said.
</P>
<P>
   Moya was so happy with his achievement that, after embracing his
Brazilian buddy, Kuerten, at the net, he clasped hands with his two
coaches and, like Dorothy clicking her heels to send herself from
Oz to Kansas, jumped up and down together 10 times in a celebration
ritual borrowed from their impromptu soccer matches. In those
stress-free sessions, said Moya, the loser has to do the leaping as
a calisthenics penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Moya had been worn to a frazzle by Kuerten in their four
previous meetings, all of them contested on clay, but today, with
everything at stake, Moya achieved his ultimate goal on his very
first attempt. ``I had motivation to be the best Spanish player,
and the No. 1,'' he said. ``The world works like that. When I have
a goal, I get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya made only 15 unforced errors in the match, and knew he had
the final-round berth, and the top spot, under control after taking
a 5-0 lead in the final set. Then, with his knees trembling, he
served for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous; I just tried to win as soon as possible,'' said
Moya, who will meet the unseeded Mark Philippoussis, a 6-1, 6-2
winner over Chris Woodruff, in the final. ``I'm going to be more
motivated than I was before. I would love to have more pressure all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after winning at Roland Garros last year, Moya made
it clear he had every intention of fighting his way to No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my time to be up,'' he said.

(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BLACK AND BLUE &LR;  By Anna Quindlen. Dell, $7.50. The heroine of
this novel is a Brooklyn nurse who packs up her 10-year-old son and
flees her abusive husband, reinventing herself in Florida and
waiting anxiously for her past to catch up with her. ``Quindlen
understands thrillers, and her story is well constructed,
beautifully paced,'' Maggie Paley wrote in The New York Times Book
Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONSILIENCE: THE UNITY OF KNOWLEDGE &LR;  By Edward O. Wilson.
Vintage, $14. The renowned sociobiologist argues that consilience _
a grand union of knowledge bound by a set of universal laws _ has
been achieved in the natural sciences but needs to be extended to
the humanities and social sciences. Such a vast interweaving of
disciplines is urgently needed, he maintains, to solve global
problems like the destruction of the environment. ``Wilson's book
sweeps across vast areas of learning in lucid, unpretentious, often
eloquent prose,'' Daniel J. Kevles wrote last year. It is ``an
arresting exposition of Wilson's religion of science and a kind of
sermon ... intended to assist in the reform of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALIENS OF AFFECTION: STORIES &LR;  By Padgett Powell. Owl/Holt, $14.
These tales are populated by lively eccentrics and losers who cast
off the bland conformity of contemporary Southern life. ``In all of
the stories there is the good humor and humane intelligence that
make Powell's work so appealing,'' A.O. Scott wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ONE BEST WAY: FREDERICK WINSLOW TAYLOR AND THE ENIGMA OF
EFFICIENCY &LR;  By Robert Kanigel. Penguin, $17.95. Frederick Winslow
Taylor (1856-1915) helped to reshape industry by arguing that the
key to increased productivity is not raw muscle alone but knowledge
gained by painstaking inspection and measurement and then properly
applied. ``Kanigel's richly detailed biography ... shows how much
drama there was in the mundane when Taylor was making it the stuff
of a new `science' of efficiency,'' George F. Will wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAR: A DRAMA OF THE AMERICAN WORKPLACE &LR;  By Mary Walton. Norton,
$17. This is an account of the radical redesign of the Ford Taurus
for the 1996 model year and a critical analysis of Ford's corporate
culture. ``This is the rare business book that is a page turner,''
Keith Bradsher wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PAPA HEMINGWAY: A PERSONAL MEMOIR &LR;  By A.E. Hotchner. Carroll &AMP;
Graf, $13.95. The author was a close friend during the last 14
years of Ernest Hemingway's life, and his admiring account is
filled with gossip, anecdotes and observations of Hemingway's daily
routines, from his obsessive work habits to his fondness for
alcohol sponge baths. ``Part Boswell, part Euripides, Hotchner has
written a greatly detailed and very loving book,'' Vance Bourjaily
wrote in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HEMINGWAY WOMEN &LR;  By Bernice Kert. Norton, $16.95. This book
focuses on the writer's complex relationships with his four wives
and his domineering mother, Grace. The author reserves ``her
highest praise for the women Hemingway hated the most _ especially
his mother,'' Aaron Latham wrote in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HOUSE GUN &LR;  By Nadine Gordimer. Penguin, $12.95. In
post-apartheid South Africa, a liberal white couple are stunned
when their son kills another white man in a crime of passion and
chooses a black lawyer for his defense. Last year the reviewer Jack
Miles called this an ``elegantly conceived, flawlessly executed
novel'' about race, violence and spiritual turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LAST APOCALYPSE: EUROPE AT THE YEAR 1000 A.D. &LR;  By James
Reston Jr. Anchor/Doubleday, $14.95. A.D. 999 was a decisive, if
bloody, year in European history, one in which the continent
finally began to gain ground in its long wars against Viking,
Moorish and Magyar invaders, and Christianity overwhelmed the
forces of paganism. ``Reston constructs a colorful and dramatic
story,'' David Walton wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BARNEY'S VERSION &LR;  By Mordecai Richler. Washington Square/Pocket
Books, $14. Barney Panovsky is a cranky, aging Jewish Canadian who
puts his failing memory to the test when he sets out to refute the
mean things written about him in a rival's autobiography. Barney's
memoir, stretching back to 1950s Paris and covering three marriages
and his best friend's death, manages to offend just about everyone
involved. In 1997 James Shapiro called Richler ``a gifted stylist,
with a great ear for parody and comic dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE APPRENTICESHIP OF DUDDY
KRAVITZ &LR;  ($14), an earlier novel featuring another of the author's
Jewish anti-heroes, an enterprising hustler who claws his way up
from the mean streets of Montreal. ``The total effect is as brash
and blatant as a sports car rally _ and as suggestive of power,''
Florence Crowther wrote in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GRANDMOTHER'S TALE: AND SELECTED STORIES &LR;  By R.K. Narayan.
Ecco, $16. These stories exploring small-town Brahmin society in
southern India are marked by simple narratives, sharply drawn
characters and a Hindu humanism. In 1994 the reviewer Shashi
Tharoor called the author ``a consummate teller of timeless tales,
a meticulous recorder of the ironies of human life ... India's
answer to Jane Austen.''

BAFFERT HORSES 1-2 IN SAN FELIPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ When it comes to good omens, trainer Bob Baffert seems
to have all of the bases covered as he goes for his third
consecutive Kentucky Derby victory.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Baffert's duo of Prime Timber and Exploit finished
one-two in the $250,000 San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber's late rush handed Exploit his first defeat in six
career starts. But either way, Baffert's chances are looking good
after one of the major Derby preps.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's Real Quiet and Silver Charm finished second in the San
Felipe the last two years, only to win the Derby and the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   While Baffert has become a Derby regular, Prime Timber's owner,
Aaron Jones, never has run a horse in the race, something he would
love to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think all of the money in the world could buy me out
of that,'' he said. ``It's a goal that is the pinnacle of the
people in the racing business.''
</P>
<P>
   The 76-year-old owner saw his 5-2 second choice hang close to
the leaders _ High Wire Act and Exploit _ and pull away in
midstretch for a two-length victory in the 1 1/16-mile Grade II
race in 1:42.16. It was Jones' biggest victory since he won the
1986 Kentucky Oaks with Tiffany Lass.
</P>
<P>
   ``All and all, I'm very happy,'' said Jones, who battled cancer
for 10 years before getting a clean bill of health in 1996. ``I was
concerned the way he eyeballs other horses and the way we were
running him back so soon (after a second-place finish in the San
Rafael Stakes on Feb. 28).
</P>
<P>
   ``But it just goes to show you Baffert is a hell of a lot better
trainer than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing with blinkers on for the first time, Prime Timber, with
David Flores aboard, was content to lay back, even though Eddie
Delahoussaye and High Wire Act raced out to a seven-length lead and
forced Exploit and Chris McCarron to pursue them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I though he was done at the three-eighths pole, but David
found another gear turning for home,'' assistant trainer Eoin Harty
said. ``He never kicked it in like that before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was his best race by far.''

HOUSTON'S McNAIR TAKES A STAND 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The most interesting sight at the NFL's annual
meetings here this week may be a billionaire throwing himself in
front of a very slow-moving train.
</P>
<P>
   Houston businessman Robert McNair, fearing the NFL will give an
expansion franchise to Los Angeles without as much as an owner or
stadium in hand, is throwing up barricades and calling in all IOUs
in hopes of stalling a decision.
</P>
<P>
   McNair wants to return the league to his own disenfranchised
city, and he's had a fully-funded, ready-to-go proposal on the NFL
table for almost year. But a majority of NFL owners lean towards
L.A., drawn by sizeable numerical advantage -- more people, more TV
sets, and higher potential franchise fee.
</P>
<P>
   The league's expansion committee, made up of 14 owners, will
convene this morning and is expected to give a lukewarm
recommendation for a 32nd team in L.A. The entire membership will
consider the issue Tuesday, and 24 of 31 votes are needed for
approval.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to stall that, McNair has in the last week:
</P>
<P>
   Guaranteed sellouts of all Houston home games for five years, a
sweeping reply to L.A.'s size advantage. He said all unsold tickets
would be donated to charity by the 72-hour TV blackout deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling television that you're not going to suffer
blackouts in Houston,'' McNair told a Houston TV station this week.
``That should be a big challenge to Los Angeles. You hear a lot of
talk about the fact that Houston is the 11th-rated media market and
Los Angeles is the second-rated market. That's very superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Played the political card by having seven Houston-area members
of the House of Representatives and both of Texas' senators
telegram or call Tagliabue with their support for McNair's
proposal. The plea included a reminder to Tagliabue that he sort of
promised Houston a franchise if it would build a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Sent letters to the owners of eight NFL teams -- Arizona,
Buffalo, Chicago, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, New England, Oakland
and Philadelphia -- saying he is interested in buying their team
and moving it to Houston should he not get an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   And implored his supporters among the owners, including Bud
Adams, who created the vacancy by moving the Oilers to Nashville,
to rally their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   It appears to have worked. Two prominent owners who usually
judge everything by the color green, Denver's Pat Bowlen and
Dallas' Jerry Jones, pooh-poohed whatever momentum L.A. had a few
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is not the no-brainer people are making it out to
be,'' said Bowlen, who sits on the league's expansion committee.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jones: ``The urgency to make a decision (on expansion)
right now is not compelling. We may need some more things to happen
as it relates to L.A. I could see where nothing could be done at
this meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is excellent at doing nothing. Five years ago, in the
same city, it did not approve the Rams' proposed move to St. Louis.
The league instead gave Georgia Frontiere a set of conditions to
meet, including tithing a chunk of the money she received from St.
Louis to move, before giving its blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the league approves planting a team in L.A., it will be
a generic decision, unspecific in regards to site and owner. Both
groups with proposals on the table, the Michael Ovitz/Carson plan
and the New Coliseum, anticipate being told to tighten up their
plans and bring more money to the table next time they meet. The
old assumption of a $500 million franchise fee has been severely
escalated to at least $650 million.
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably, the league could impose a deadline on L.A. to get
its act together -- say the end of the year -- that includes back
door language for Houston should L.A. fumble its opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   League officials have suggested that Team Ovitz and Team
Coliseum merge its forces -- and fortunes. Considering the
diversity of the groups and proposals, that's highly unlikely. But
the NFL is never too proud to ask.

KINGS LOOK FOR AHL AFFILIATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By ROGER PHILLIPS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ King GM Dave Taylor said Saturday the team
is seeking its own American Hockey League affiliate to develop its
players, but that any such arrangement probably won't happen until
at least the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at some things,'' Taylor said. ``We don't have
anything concrete. Down the road, it's definitely where we're going
to be. The time frame is uncertain. But we have talked to some
teams in the AHL.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Kings have placed some prospects in Springfield
of the AHL, which also receives players from the Phoenix Coyotes.
The Kings also have several players with the Long Beach Ice Dogs of
the IHL. Both arrangements expire after this season. The AHL is
considered the top developmental minor league, with the IHL home to
more veteran players than the AHL.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson said the Kings would benefit from having
their own AHL affiliate. Without it, he said, a team is somewhat at
the whim of the coach of the team it sends its prospects to. If the
Kings had their own affiliate, Robinson said, they'd be in more
control of how their prospects are developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have your own coach and your own system, you say, `Hey,
listen, this kid, we have to mature him and we have to educate him
and we've got to get him ready,'' Robinson said. ``When you are
sharing a team, they're going to have their ways and their players
and the coach that's in there is just trying to win hockey games.''
</P>
<P>
   Open-minded (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of this season, Robinson said he's prepared to
listen to the request of his team's leaders and stick with lineups
that are successful rather than adjusting them to match up with an
opponent's roster.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's up to the players to prove their idea was a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line is there,'' Robinson said following Saturday
morning's skate at the Forum before the evening's game against the
Vancouver Canucks. ``Strangle yourself or go fishing. In years
past, whatever coaches said went. Now, you've got to listen to the
players. I'm all for that. My door is always open.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Canucks, Robinson used the same lineup that defeated
Detroit, 4-2, on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have confidence in themselves and they feel the team
that they have has confidence and can play against anybody, I have
no problem with them,'' Robinson said. ``I'm as flexible as they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   One player omitted from the lineup the last two games is
defenseman Steve Duchesne, who has struggled all season after
signing a contract that pays him $3.75 million a year. When he was
announced as a scratch before Saturday's game, a large portion of
the crowd in the Forum cheered.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers' star turn on Friday's ``The Tonight
Show'' included magnificent seven-player cast that was accompanied
by head coach Chris Ford and assistant coach Jim Todd.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who did exercise an option to skip the trip was
forward Maurice Taylor. Taylor said Jay Leno's monologue jabs about
the Clippers don't bother him, and insisted he would have attended
if the entire team had agreed to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't like to celebrate one win,'' Taylor said. ``Now,
if we win 17 in a row, I'll go out there and dance buck naked.''
</P>
<P>
   One Clipper who decided to go with the show was point guard
Darrick Martin, who was once of three players included as ``You
Make The Call'' contestants. He also gave Leno a bit of grief about
his knack for making the Clippers a consistent punch line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to give him some of his own medicine,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   subhead Nothing to Wright about
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's deadline for teams to offer contract extensions to
their players selected in the 1996 NBA Draft came and went without
re-enlistment of center/forward Lorenzen Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, the No. 8 pick in '96, and his agent asked for a
six-year, $60 million extension back in January. The Clippers
conferred, and - after about five seconds - said that price was a
bit steep. So Wright's agent asked for a trade.
</P>
<P>
   A trade almost occurred less than two weeks ago, when the
Clippers offered the 6-foot-10 Wright and backup guard Pooh
Richardson to Portland in exchange for shooting guard Isaiah Rider.
The deal was almost a go, but Rider's improved play - and a Blazer
winning streak -- sabotaged the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Wright snagged 25 points in the Clippers'
first victory.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead `Kandivision'
</P>
<P>
   Michael Olowokandi spent the last two days in the viewfinder of
TNT as the subject of an upcoming ``Day In The Life'' feature. The
cable network had followed Olowokandi around the University of
Pacific last year, and plans to use the current filming as a follow
story.
</P>
<P>
   Included will be exciting footage of Olowokandi shaving his
head, a fashion choice that played to rave reviews from his
teammates. The rookie center was fulfilling a promise to shave his
head after the Clippers scored their first victory.
