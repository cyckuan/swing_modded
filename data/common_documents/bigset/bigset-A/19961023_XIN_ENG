<HEADLINE> UK Launches First National Benchmarking Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Small Business Minister Richard
Page today urged small firms to use the new British Benchmarking
Index, the first national benchmarking service specially designed
for small companies.
</P>
<P>
Page also called on the small businesses to follow through by
taking necessary action to correct them.
</P>
<P>
Small business people in Britain need to stop stumbling around
in the dark and throw some light on their strengths and
weaknesses, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Benchmarking Index is a simple, computer-based system
that, through a series of questions, will allow a huge range of
different types of small firms to compare their performance in key
areas like finance, management and operations with other companies
in their sector or region.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of all the firms in the economy have 20
employees or less, and yet these small operations need to be just
as skilled at finance, marketing, innovation, production and
management as big multinationals who employ a large number of
specialists.
</P>
<P>
Benchmarking is an effective way for small firms to evaluate
their competitiveness in these areas. And objective results mean
that they can then work with organizations like Business Links and
Trade Associations to decide on their future business directions
and priorities.
</P>
<P>
The Benchmarking Index helps management teams assess and
improve overall business performance. It provides comprehensive,
quantifiable and objective performance information, and enables
companies to compare themselves easily.
</P>
<P>
The index highlights business strengths and weaknesses,
identifying areas needing improvement. Working with Business
Advisers provides opportunities to develop action plans to
implement these improvements.
</P>
<P>
"Benchmarking is about continuous improvement. Companies can
return to benchmark their performance at regular intervals, not
only to monitor the results of their improvement programs, but
also to keep an eye on the competition," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Trade Associations also have an important role to play. As
well as being a strong national voice for their members they can
work with them to improve the competitiveness of their sector.
Benchmarking can provide a good starting point for such
activities," he added.

<HEADLINE> UK House Prices Boosted by Property Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- House prices in Britain are
expected to rise sharply because of a serious shortage of
properties for sale, according to a survey by the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) out today.
</P>
<P>
The survey of more than 100 estate agents showed that the
number of properties on the market during the past quarter was at
an eight-year low and has dropped by a third compared with the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Shortage was at its worst in southern England but was "fast
becoming a problem for all regions," the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The RICS said that some owners were delaying putting their
properties on the market because they had "over-optimistic"
expectations of further price rises.
</P>
<P>
"The scarcity of property is forcing up prices and desirable
properties are being sold extremely quickly, giving the false
impression that a boom is imminent," the institution said.
</P>
<P>
A net balance of 43 percent of surveyors reported rising
residential property prices in the quarter to September 30, the
highest since September 1988. The proportion rose to 84 percent in
London and 73 percent in southeast England as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Observes Environment Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has started an
"Environment Week" from Monday to raise the public awareness on
the protection of environment on the island.
</P>
<P>
The topic for this year's week is "consumption patterns and
the future of our planet."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to mark the event Monday, Cyprus'
Minister of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment Costas
Petrides stressed that environmental protection must become a
way of life for everyone.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proved that excessive demands on natural
resources and lifestyles not characterized by sustainability put
huge pressure on the environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rising standards of living on the island had led to "habits
of over-consumption", he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that "human civilization cannot exist
without its physical base: in the long-term, the future of life
on earth depends on our provision for environmental protection."
</P>
<P>
During the week, a number of lectures on the theme of
consumerism and the environment will be organized all over the
island.

<HEADLINE> France Protests Israeli Police's Brutality during </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- France today lodged a strong
protest against Israel over "brutality and mortification"
inflicted by its security forces during President Jacques
Chirac's visit in East Jerusalem this morning.
</P>
<P>
"The manifestly exaggerated number of security agents, the
brutality and mortification that the Israeli authorities inflicted
upon the inhabitants of the old city and upon the journalists
present, have changed the friendly and relaxed character which
this visit should have taken on," said French ambassador to Israel
Jean-Noel de Bouillane de Lacoste.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also protested against the "behavior of the
Israeli (police) units" toward the French president, local media
quoted French official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
De Lacoste also lashed out at the Israeli government for
failing to observe its earlier promise that it would reduce the
presence of security forces in East Jerusalem to "the strict
minimum" during Chirac's visit.
</P>
<P>
Chirac himself also lodged a strong protest to Israel over the
rude behavior of Israeli security forces, and threatened to cut
short his visit to the nation.
</P>
<P>
"What do you want? Do you want me to go back to my plane?" said
the president in English while elbowing his way through an
encircling cordon formed by Israeli security forces to prevent him
from walking towards some Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chairman of the French parliamentary majority,
Michel Pericard, expressed his "deep shock" over the treatment of
Chirac by Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
"Jacques Chirac is in the Middle East for a peace mission. He
is not there as an enemy of the Israelis. We cannot but share his
protest," said Pericard, who represents the ruling Rassemblement
pour la Republique corps in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Several scuffles took place between Israeli security forces and
Chirac's entourage and journalists covering the news.
</P>
<P>
Chirac refused to walk into a French church in the old city
until a team of 25 Israeli soldiers withdrew from the compound of
the Church of Saint-Anne, which is a French property.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is a city which should remain open: open to
Christians of Palestine as well as the world, open to all the
religions for sure,'' said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The president said Jerusalem could not become a "city of peace"
within the heart of ``a zone of peace'' unless it was open to and
belonged to everyone.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who is due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu later today, was to visit the Yad Vachem Holocaust
Memorial, pay homage at the tomb of the assassinated former Prime
Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and tour the Israeli parliament, the
Knesset.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on Tumen River Area Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese official
today said that China and other member countries of Consultative
Commission of the Tumen River economic development program have
agreed to invite Japan as an official full member of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, Assistant to the Minister of the Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, announced the move at a press conference in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan's attendance will bring the development
program in the Tumen River Area to an international level in
northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the only country in northeast Asia which is not a
full member of the consultative commission.
</P>
<P>
Long also praised the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) support for the program, noting that the UNDP has promised
to contribute three million US dollars to the program.
</P>
<P>
So far, UNDP has donated four million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
By mid-1996, the Tumen region had managed to attract and use
526 million US dollars in foreign investment, with 50 percent
going to Russia and 40 percent to China.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the region is expected to reach 650
million US dollars by the end of this year, and 800 million US
dollars by next year.
</P>
<P>
Long also mentioned China's contribution, saying that the
Chinese government has been paying close attention to the
program.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, China has invested a total of eight
billion yuan to infrastructure construction in the Tumen River
region.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Hold Contest on Plans to Promote Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to hold a contest in
November to encourage young students and other young people to
make plans on the promotion of the Macao Basic Law, organizers
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Co-organized by the Youth Committee of the Macao Chamber of
Commerce and the Macao Telecommunications Company, and in
cooperation with the Macao Basic Law Promotion Association, the
contest will be conducted between November 11 and 15, and the
final results will be announced in December.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have one or two excellent plans on the promotion
program after the contest," said H. I. Kou, director of the Youth
Committee of the Macao Chamber of Commerce and chief of the
organizing committee. "That will help us better promote the law,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Students' societies and youth organizations are encouraged to
participate in the contest of designing plans. They have been
asked to present to the organizing committee a detailed plan
within a budget of 200,000 patacas (about 25,300 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The winners will be awarded with several thousand patacas and
certification cups. Their names will also be put on local
newspapers, according to the organizers.
</P>

Currently, a dozen students' societies and youth organizations
have expressed their willingness to participate in the contest and
are making preparations, said Kou, who just finished visits to
some of them.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that such activities will let the youth

Region, and that in turn will help increase their confidence in
the future after 1999," said Kou.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Announces Tough Economic Reform Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
today announced a package of economic structural reforms to raise
40 billion rupees (one billion US dollars) in additional revenues
to stabilize the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, Governor of the
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Muhammad Yaqub announced the package
in the southern port city of Karachi, the country's economic and
commercial center.
</P>
<P>
The package seeks to raise the revenue by containing government
expenditures and through new taxation measures approved by Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto and her cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Yaqub said that the package would restore the national and
international confidence, and help improve the health of the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) ended in Washington last week with Pakistan seeking
financial assistance from the IMF to overcome its economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the IMF has put tough conditions for
the release of the delayed second and third tranche of its
600-million-US-dollar standby loan, which Pakistan needs badly.
</P>
<P>
The new package was worked out after the first round of talks
failed early this month due to the IMF's dissatisfaction with
Pakistan's economic performances.
</P>
<P>
Yaqub said the new policy package was developed under the
guidance of the prime minister and is different from the one
suggested by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a package whose ownership is endowed. It is a
package by the government of Pakistan," Yaqub said, adding that it
is designed to tackle short- and medium-term problems in the
national economic policies.
</P>
<P>
According to Yaqub, the IMF has accepted the new package as a
basis of consideration for restoring the presently inoperative
standby arrangement.
</P>
<P>
He noted the World Bank was fully supportive of the package.
</P>
<P>
The SBP governor said that of the total package, 27 billion
rupees (700 million US dollars) would be raised through reduction
of government expenditures and 13 billion (300 million dollars)
through new revenue measures.
</P>
<P>
About 20 to 21 billion rupees (500 million dollars) would be
raised through cuts in less important development expenditures and
six billion rupees (150 million dollars) would be collected
through reduction in the current expenditure, he said.
</P>
<P>
The defense budget has not been touched in this package, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the new revenue measures, Yaqub said that four
provinces would raise two billion rupees (50 million dollars) from
the tax on agriculture income.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum prices have been raised by 10 percent due to
downward readjustment of the Pakistani rupee in exchange of the
dollar by 8.5 percent today.
</P>
<P>
The increase in taxes includes a 10 percent rise in the excise
duty on gas distribution, a 50 percent rise in the foreign travel
tax and a 100 percent rise in the passport fee and airport tax.
</P>
<P>
The SBP governor said that the government is enacting a law to
speedily recover the defaulted loans, which have amounted to 100
billion rupees (2.5 billion dollars).

<P>
BRUSSELS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The risk from earthquakes to
urban areas in central Asia will be assessed at a workshop in
Kazakhstan by scientists from NATO and partner countries.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, from Tuesday to Friday, will design a seismic
risk management strategy for the region. Fifty scientists and
engineers will also work out an action plan following keynote
lectures and group discussions.
</P>
<P>
The workshop will take advantage of pre-workshop studies made
in each of the five Central Asian republics -- Kazakhstan,
Kirgizstan, Tadzhikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Armenian earthquake and the 1995 Sakhalin earthquake
demonstrated the risks associated with some types of residential
construction. Similar constructions exist throughout Central
Asia, home of some 55 million people.
</P>
<P>
The break-up of the former Soviet Union resulted in an exodus
of some of the region's most highly trained earthquake engineers
and seismologists.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Expanded NATO by 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today called for an expansion of NATO by accepting former Soviet
bloc nations as members by the end of 1999, the 50th anniversary
of the Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
"I want to state America's goal: By 1999 -- NATO's 50th
anniversary and 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall -- the
first group of countries we invite to join should be full-fledged
members of NATO," Clinton said to an invited audience of foreign
policy experts and community leaders in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
It was Clinton's first major foreign policy speech of the
presidential campaign. He chose to make his foreign policy speech
two weeks before the election day "because he wanted in the
closing weeks of the campaign to review the record this
administration has compiled in foreign policy," White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole criticized Clinton
for drugging the NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not identify the candidate countries as the
decisions should be made by NATO although the U.S. carries the
most weight in it.
</P>
<P>
The NATO is expected to announced its expansion plan at a
summit meeting of allied leaders next spring.
</P>
<P>
Russia is strongly opposed to NATO expansion as it says that
the Western alliance's eastward enlargement would pose new
security threats to Russia. Some Russian leaders have repeatedly
warned the West that Russia would not ratifying the START II
nuclear arms treaty if NATO expanded eastward.
</P>
<P>
While insisting that NATO would go ahead with its expansion
plans despite Russia's objections, Clinton attempted to calm the
Russians by saying, "Enlargement is not directed against anyone.
It will advance the security of everyone."
</P>
<P>
"By reducing rivalry and fear, by strengthening peace and
cooperation, NATO will promote greater stability in Europe, and
Russia will be among the beneficiaries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1949 as a counterweight to the Soviet Union,
NATO now has 16 members.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo to Stick to Thomson Multimedia Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Daewoo Electronics
Corporation vowed Tuesday to stick to its plans to take over the
French electronics company, Thomson Multimedia (TMM).
</P>
<P>
"I believe my proposal is the best one to make Thomson
Multimedia profitable," said Soon-Hoon Bae, president of Daewoo
Electronics.
</P>
<P>
The French government has agreed to sell the loss-making
Thomson SA, a defense and electronics group, to Lagardere Group,
which will leave TMM, the civilian part of the Thomson SA, to
Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
Bae said that it is unlikely that a French company would bid
for TMM or join Daewoo as a partner.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the French Government does not change its
procedure, no one else can make a proposal at the present time"
said Bae.
</P>
<P>
The French Government denied local media reports that
negotiations were going on between the government and a French
company over the possibility of maintaining TMM "under the French
flag."
</P>
<P>
Bae said the offer presented by Lagardere on the take-over by
Daewoo of the TMM contained "very precise commitments by Daewoo
concerning its intentions for TMM in the next two years."
</P>
<P>
He said the commitments "exclude all participation by another
French group, either financial or industrial."
</P>
<P>
The deal is still pending approval by the French Commission of
Privitization and the European Commission.

<HEADLINE> London Wins Top Global Ranking for 3rd Year Running </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- London has been named the
world's favorite European city for the third year running in the
Fortune magazine's 1996 global Best Cities for Business survey,
winning second place on the international list as well.
</P>
<P>
It is also the only city anywhere in the world to have
maintained its position as one of the world's top three cities for
three years since the survey began.
</P>
<P>
Since that time London has always appeared while others have
included Toronto, Singapore, Hong Kong, New York and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
London, where the food used to be rubbish but in recent years
has become much more international in flair, where grimy monuments
have been cleared up, and where the highest unemployment of any
European capital has become the lowest, remains one of the safest
and friendliest places in Europe, according to the Fortune
magazine.
</P>
<P>
Compared with many other business cities, the cost of living is
relatively low. Add to that a bustling nightlife, a broad array of
cultural attractions, 200 theaters, 50 major museums, five
symphony orchestras, and two opera companies.
</P>
<P>
These attractions and a deregulated economy with the incentives
have drawn in many foreign businesses. London is the world's
capital of foreign exchange trading, international bonds,
cross-border equities, and swaps, with a financial sector alone
employing 272,000.
</P>
<P>
Stephen O'brien, chief executive of the investment agency
London First Center, said, "Companies from across the globe locate
here to take advantage of the city's specialist expertise, the
best access to major international markets and a business
infrastructure judged to be the most competitive in Europe."
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by consultancy Arthur Andersen, polled
10,000 senior executives in 60 cities worldwide and is the only
global list of relocation rankings.
</P>
<P>
The selection analysis of premier cities centered on those
offering the best opportunity to balance success in business and a
quality lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
Toronto has remained the first in the survey this year.

<HEADLINE> More Nigerian Deportees Coming From Guinea Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The second batch of Nigerians
who are among 50 Africans detained in Guinea Bissau are expected
to be in the country this week.
</P>
<P>
The 19 Nigerians who were deported from Spain, are being
brought back at the expense of the government of Guinea Bissau,
the local newspaper "Guardian" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Foreign Affairs Ministry officials as
disclosing that a good number of them were supposed to have
arrived in Nigeria by last week.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Nigerians were deported as illegal
aliens without any confirmation. Details are not known at the
moment, but the newspaper quoted a ministry source as saying:
"Things like this do not just happen."
</P>
<P>
On why they are being brought back at the expense of Guinea
Bisssau, the source said: "That was the first diplomatic
intervention. After series of consultations between us and the
Guinea authorities, it was agreed that country should handle
their repatriation."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerians allegedly suffered inhuman treatment in the
hands of their guards, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In recent times, there have been a series of complaints from
Nigerians living in other parts of the continent of extortion and
undue harassment and detention by their host countries.
</P>
<P>
Cape Verde, Cameroon, Benin republic and Mozambique are a few
of such countries accused of alleged maltreatment of Nigerians,
according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Experts Share Views on Energy Conservation, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Oil experts vowed to explore new
approaches to conserve energy and control pollution at the 13th
World Oil Conference here today, a high-calibre event combining
expertise, oral presentations and exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
A stall highlighting a natural gas vehicle attracted a large
crowd of visitors in an enlarged exhibition hall in the Cairo
International Conference Center, where petroleum products and
articles of varied disciplines are on show.
</P>
<P>
The updated line fresh from the Natural Gas Vehicle Company of
Egypt is powered by compressed natural gas instead of benzene. It
showcases the state-of-the-art vehicle conversion system of
Egypt, which has made repeated calls to "energize the future"
with clean, safe and economical fuel.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 1,500 representatives from Arab companies, research
institutes, funds and other organizations worldwide are
participating in the three-day expertise presentations, which are
divided into three categories: exploration, production and
downstream.
</P>
<P>
The full-agenda conference will cover 300 papers dealing with
a complete spectrum of the petroleum industry, ranging from oil
exploration, production and refining to the very downstream
activities of pollution control, energy conservation and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
The theme of "Environment and Petroleum Industry," introduced
at Monday's opening and plenary sessions, is designed to project
the safety and environmental issues as the utmost concern of the
oil industry.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session, Egyptian Minister of Petroleum Hamdy
el-Banbi predicated oil and natural gas would remain the prime
source of global energy for another century.
</P>
<P>
He said the world demand on oil would rise by 2 percent
annually as the current output has exceeded demand by 2 million
barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
Although supply will keep ahead of demand till 2005 it can
fall short by over 10 million bpd by 2010, the Egyptian minister
gave the warning at the oil conference, a bi-annual event
organized by the General Egyptian Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, even if some new sources replace oil to cover the
energy shortage, they can not substitute oil in the fields that
have direct impact on human life, he said.
</P>
<P>
The convocation of the four-day conference, considered as an
important chance to lure foreign investors to Egypt, coincides
with the 110th anniversary of the establishment of the oil
industry in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry, one of the four largest foreign exchange
sources in Egypt, produced 50 percent of the country's total
exports.
</P>
<P>
The oil and gas industry has witnessed noticeable growth, with
crude oil and gas output reaching 44.1 million tons and 9.9
million tons respectively in the 1995-96 fiscal year, according
to a report by the general Egyptian Oil Authority.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has signed 277 oil exploration agreements with foreign
companies, with a total foreign investment of 17.2 billion
U.S. dollars. So far, 61 new oil fields have been found.
</P>
<P>
El-Banbi attributed the increase in oil finds and agreements
to the domestic stability and security.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was among the first countries to extract oil from the
Red Sea, but production only began in 1910.
</P>
<P>
The first oil refinery in the Middle East was built in Suez in
1911, when the world production of oil did not exceed 400,000
bpd.

<HEADLINE> China Explains Stand on Human Rights Office in Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of a
human rights office in Abkhazia of Georgia should not be the task
of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG),
Chinese ambassador Wang Xuexian told the U.N. Security Council
today.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with an agreement reached by the two parties in
Georgia, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, a human rights
office will be set up in Abkhazia of Georgia. The U.N.
secretary-general recommended that the UNOMIG provide appropriate
support facilities.
</P>
<P>
However, some European nations and the United States gave their
support Monday to a draft resolution of the Security Council which
agreed to make the office part of the tasks of the UNOMIG.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the UNOMIG is entrusted mainly with the
peacekeeping mandate by the Security Council. "We are of the view
that peacekeeping operations should have a clear mandate," he
said, adding that they should not be all-inclusive.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese delegation proposed amendments to the
draft resolution. But the amendments were not accepted.
</P>
<P>
It is beyond the terms of reference of the Security Council to
authorize the establishment of the office, according to the
Chinese ambassador.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the adoption of this draft resolution should
in no way constitute a precedent for other U.N. peacekeeping
operations.
</P>
<P>
Wang also voiced the hope for an early comprehensive political
settlement of the Georgian question through earnest negotiations.

AMMAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti met here today with Israeli Ambassador to Jordan
Shimon Shamir who briefed him on the latest developments of the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli ambassador told reporters after the meeting that
progress has been made on the Israeli troop redeployment from
the West Bank town of Hebron and an agreement could be signed
within days.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known what kind of "progress," as the
Israeli envoy said, has been made.
</P>
<P>
After threatening to go home, U.S. Middle East coordinator
Denis Ross returned to supervise the negotiations between Israel
and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
A new round of talks was to be held this evening.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Palestine resumed their negotiations on the
arrangement of Hebron shortly after the Washington summit at the
beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment of Israeli troops from Hebron, the last West
Bank town still under Israeli occupation, has been a hard nut to
crack in the resumed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, in an interview
with Jordanian press late last week, said that he would keep his
promises to King Hussein during the Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly told the king that he would give the king "a
pleasant surprise."

<P>
HARARE, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's major hospitals
today closed some of their wards as the strike staged by
nationwide nurses and junior doctors entered its second day.
</P>
<P>
Harare's Parirenyatwa Hospital Acting Superintendent,
Callistus Madziva said all non-emergency units have been closed
while other emergency cases had been centralised.
</P>
<P>
The nurses and junior doctors went on strike on Monday,
accusing the government of having failed to address their salary
demands.
</P>
<P>
In August, they, together with other civil servants, ended a
two-week industrial action after the government promised to look
into their demands which included a 40-hour working week, more
risk pay and higher housing and transport allowances.
</P>
<P>
The strikers today gathered at Africa Unity Square in central
Harare, vowing not to go back to work until their grievances were
adequately addressed.
</P>
<P>
Today, the Zimbabwe Teachers' Union, which says it represents
30,000 of Zimbabwe's 90,000 teachers, urged its members to join
the nationwide strike by junior doctors and nurses for better
working conditions.
</P>
<P>
But, the Public Service Association has dissociated itself
from the on-going nursess and junior doctors' strike saying they
would rather wait for negotiations scheduled for Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Shot Dead near Ramallah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A 19-year-old Palestinian
boy was shot and killed today during clashes between Palestinian
youths and Israeli soldiers near the West Bank town of Ramallah,
Israel Radio reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian witnesses blamed Israeli soldiers for the killing
of Abdallah Qaraqe, from the village of Sajin in north of
Ramallah, adding he was shot during a stone-throwing
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Qaraqe was seriously wounded by the shot, and was rushed to
the hospital in Ramallah. However, doctors there could not save
the youngster's life from his wound.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses added that the demonstration was held following
the funeral of Fathi Sahuri, 43, also from Sajin, who was killed
Monday night in a stoning incident on the Ramallah bypass road.
</P>
<P>
The Radio reports said that the incident occurred when a
stone, which was apparently thrown from an olive grove, broke
the windshield of Sahuri's car, and hit him in the head, causing
his death.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said that it was unclear whether Arabs or Jews
were behind the stoning, while a Palestinian source noted that
both Qaraqe and Sahuri were killed by Jewish settlers in the
area.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Israeli army said that the army is looking
into the two incidents, adding that the Palestinian police were
cooperating with the Israeli side in the investigation.

<P>
LAGOS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Forty-seven armed robbery
suspects kept at a prison in Ogun State in western Nigeria have
broken jail, barely four months after a similar incidence in
Bauchi State in which 35 inmates escaped.
</P>
<P>
local media reported today that the prisoners at the Abeokuta
federal prison set their mattresses on fire at 1:30 on Sunday
morning, which soon spread to four cells.
</P>
<P>
Within 30 minutes, the prisoners destroyed the windows and
gained freedom. they then overpowered panic-stricken warders
whose attention was divided between the fire and the breakers,
and escaped from the high fence of the prison.
</P>
<P>
The local police have been alerted by the fire, but when they
came to the site with the firemen, the breakers were already
gone.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers said the city had been in a power failure for five
weeks before the incidence, so the prison authority had given
each cell a hurricane lamp. The prisoners used the kerosine of
the lamp to set ablaze their mattresses.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said two breakers had been re-arrested, adding
that all the convicts of prison had not escaped, fortunately.

<HEADLINE> France, Egypt Should Work Together for Peace: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette said Egypt and France should join forces in pushing
forward the peace process in regard to their big influence in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after his meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak here today to prepare for the Friday
summit between the Egyptian president and his French counterpart
Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is a ranking country with high responsibilities in the
region, he told the press following today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
"It is only natural that Egyptian and French efforts are
joined towards making progress on the peace track," he said.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said Mubarak has welcomed the Palestinian request
that France should contribute more to the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
When commenting on the Israeli opposition to France's
involvement in the peace process, he said all countries and
parties concerned should exert concerted efforts toward peace.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the French official added that the Mideast
peace-making process is vital for France, which has interests in
the region.
</P>
<P>
When asked about whether the departure of U.S. Middle East
peace coordinator Dennis Ross means failure in the current
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, de Charette said France
"recognizes, supports and encourages" the major U.S. role in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Ross had threatened to return to Washington if no immediate
progress was made in the Eilat round of Palestinian-Israeli
talks, which were postponed indefinitely Monday without forging
any deal on implementing the 1995 Taba agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Palestine remained wide split over the long overdue
troop pullout from Hebron, the last West Bank town still under
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli push for tighter security arrangement for the 450
Jewish settlers among 120,000 Arabs was blankly rejected by the
Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
The peace process should be put back on track in accordance
with relevant U.N. resolutions, the signed deals based on the
land-for-peace principle and the right to self-determination, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The French president is scheduled to wrap up here his
six-nation Mideast tour designed to bolster French and European
peace efforts in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's tour also includes Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and
the Palestinian self-rule areas.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council adopted today a resolution calling for a cease-fire and
political negotiations in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The call was made at a time when there was no sign on the
ground of the rival sides suspending their battle for the plains
north of the capital Kabul.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Taleban fighters, who took the capital
last month, poured rockets into positions held by former
government military chief Ahmad Shah Masood to the north. Masood's
forces fought their way forward today towards the strategic Khair
Khana pass on the main road into Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which was approved by the council unanimously,
also called upon states to refrain from interfering in the
conflict and to stop supplying arms to the factions.
</P>
<P>
It requested all Afghan parties to cooperate with the United
Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan, and encouraged all
interested states and international organizations to take all
steps necessary to promote peace in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Lodges Formal Protest Against Excessive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French President
Jacques Chirac today lodged a formal protest with the Israeli
Foreign Ministry over unnecessary excessive security measures
during his tour of the Old City in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that contrary to promises to him, a large number
of security personnel accompanied him on the tour and prevented
him from speaking to journalists and local Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Chirac was forced to use his elbow to make
his way through the tight security cordon. The French head of
state was so angry that he yelled to the security head on the
spot: "This is provocation. Stop this now. Do you want me to go
back to my plane and go back to France?"
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu apologized for the
extraordinary diplomatic incident during his working meeting
with Chirac this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu argued, however, that it was an Israeli way to
protect a friend and he himself is subject to such a heavy
security.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, during a brief visit to Knesset (parliament),
Chirac received a none too cordial reception from the
law-makers.
</P>
<P>
At the VIP gallery of the house plenum, Rehavam Ze'evi,
member of Knesset from the far-right Moledet party, rose from
his seat to protest that President Chirac would not address the
house. He claimed that only the PLO will gain as the president
will address the Palestinian parliament -- Palestinian
Legislative Council -- in Ramallah Wednesday. Ze'evi accused
Chirac of disgracing the Knesset. He called it anti-Semite as he
walked out.
</P>
<P>
Knesset Speaker Dan Tichon was more subtle in his criticism,
according to Israel Radio. Tichon welcomed his guest, but added
at the same time, "we have a dispute with you. But I am sure that
you state your views with honorable desire to make your
contribution to faithful negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Chirac will conclude his three-day official visit at a
farewell ceremony to be held by Israeli President Ezer Weizman
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Israel is the second stop of Chirac's Middle East tour, which
will also take him to Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt. He
started the swing with a visit to Syria Monday.

</P>

Under the agreement the chiefs would cooperate in the

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Meets Northern Iraqi Faction Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said here today that both
leaders of the two rival factions in northern Iraq, the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
(PUK), had a very positive view on securing a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Ciller made the remarks this evening after her 40-minute-long
meeting with PUK leader Jalal Talabani, who arrived here this
morning via Istanbul from Tehran through Turkish Airlines for
talks with Ciller and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert
Pelletreau.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said: "We hope that a cease-fire between the two
Kurdish parties would be achieved soon."
</P>
<P>
Talabani told reporters that his meeting with the Turkish
foreign minister was "very useful."
</P>
<P>
Talabani is now holding talks with Pelletreau, who is trying
to conclude a cease-fire between the PUK and the KDP.
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau met with KDP leader Massoud Barzani Monday in the
Turkish border town of Silopi, Sirnak province, which borders
northern Iraq, in a bid to work out a solution to the prolonged
bitter clashes between the two Kurdish groups.
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau said that he had stressed to Barzani the importance
of seeing that neither the Iraqi government nor Iran interfered
in the inter-Kurdish fighting in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy met with KDP and PUK officials last week in
Washington in an attempt to bring about a truce between the two
sides and to convince the KDP to cut its ties with the Iraqi
government.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the KDP
and the PUK began fighting in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki on Eradication of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government is dedicated itself to the eradication of poverty,
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a special debate held in Cape Town to
mark the United Nations' International Year for Eradication of
Poverty.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said poverty not only brought hunger, disease,
inadequate shelter and homelessness, but also hindered the
education of the children and left them on the margins of
society.
</P>
<P>
He further stressed that the debate was not about a choice
between economic growth and poverty reduction, but about how to
move society on the parallel tracks of growth and poverty
eradication, adding the Government sought not merely economic
growth in the narrow sense, but human development in the larger
sense.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Welfare Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi said the
Government was co-operating with the World Bank and the United
Nations Development Program to produce a report on poverty and
inequality in the country.
</P>
<P>
The opposition National Party Secretary-General Roelf Meyer
said he fully supported Mbeki's views on economic growth and
human development, but he said the Government lacked a vision for
dealing with poverty.
</P>
<P>
Only through skills development, training and job creation
could the problem be effectively addressed, said Meyer.
</P>
<P>
On October 17, President Nelson Mandela said the eradication
of poverty remained government's number one priority.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said: "As a caring society, we cannot fold our arms
and leave this blight on the lives of millions of people. That is
why, as a government, we have declared war on poverty." enditem

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- International standards
should be developed for products that are of particular interest
to developing countries, a national seminar on the Uruguay Round
Results was told in Dar es Salaam today.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper on agreement on technical barriers to trade
at the seminar, an expert said it is important that international
standards are developed for goods of interest to the least
developing countries (LDCs) than restricting the products to the
developed countries only.
</P>
<P>
Counsellor on technical cooperation with the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in Switzerland Maarten Smeets told
participants here there is a need for harmonization through
promoting international standards, acceptance of conformity
assessment and of equivalent technical regulations by others.
</P>
<P>
He said that would help in eliminating unnecessary obstacles
to international trade, adding that there should also be access
to certification systems and facilitation of international
normalization.
</P>
<P>
Smeets also emphasized the need for giving technical aid to
the LDCs for establishing international standardizing bodies,
citing infrastructure, know-how and capacity to meet
international standards in their own countries' products.
</P>
<P>
The WTO, established in 1995, is aimed at raising standards of
living, ensuring full employment, expanding the production of
and trade in goods and services and to secure for developing
countries a share in the growth in international trade
commensurate with the needs of their economic development.

and international economic and industrial experts, opened

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique is to export
8,000 tons of maize surplus to Angola before the end of the year,
an official announced in Maputo today.
</P>
<P>
Director of Mozambique's grain marketing authorities Lourenco
Marra said exporting maize to Angola depends on available wagons
in the railway network in northern Mozambique, Southern African
Broadcasting Association (SABA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Marra said the maize is currently in the country's northern
provinces of Niassa and Nampula, awaiting to be moved to Nacala
port for shipment.
</P>
<P>
He said the sale to Angola will be Mozambique's second export
of its surplus maize this year.
</P>
<P>
In September, Mozambique shipped 13,400 tons of maize to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government spent more than six million U.S.
Dollars to help peasants increase production in the 1995/96
season, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Mozambique is expected to harvest
947,000 tons of maize this year.
</P>
<P>
An international mission which is assessing grain production
in Mozambique said the harvest is the highest record in the

<HEADLINE> Iranian Teachers Warned of Dismissal over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian education
authorities warned teachers of dismissal and law suits if they
punish their students corporally at school, a press report said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Ali-Reza Taghipour, a director from the Education Ministry,
said that corporal punishment was forbidden at school and
violators would be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
The Persian-language daily Akhbar quoted the official as
saying, "If a member of (the) teaching staff or school
administration subject a student to physical punishment, they
would be expelled from job and face legal charges."
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision was made in response to telephone
calls by a number of disgruntled parents who called in to
register their complaints over physical punishment by some
teachers.
</P>
<P>
The father of a school student told Xinhua that physical
punishment is very prevalent at Iranian schools, primary ones in
particular.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed parent said that many parents had lodged
complaints over various kinds of illtreatment by teachers such
as beating, kicking and hand twisting or verbal abuses.
</P>
<P>
He said that his wife visited the school because his daughter
was also suffering from the same problem.
</P>
<P>
The government official said that students at all levels are
sufficiently endowed with sense and intelligence to grasp
instructions and guidelines. There is no need to subject them to
physical punishments.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3 million elementary school students in the
country among a population of 65 million at present.

<HEADLINE> Zaire Accuses Rwanda, Burundi of Starting War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Zaire today formally accused
Rwanda and Burundi of starting a war by attacking its province of
South Kivu with 1,700 troops, but it gave neither date nor
specific conditions under which the attack was made, according to
reports from Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"The elements of the Burundian and Rwandan armed forces,
nearly 1,700 men of troops, attacked a part of the Zairean
territory situated between Buenguera and Luvungi," said the
Zairean government in a communique issued after an extraordinary
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Rwandan government today rejected all
accusations by Zaire about its responsibility in the on-going
fightings between the Zairean troops and the Banyamurenges in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"It is the Zaireans who started it, by chasing the
Banyamurenges," Major Wilson Rutayisire, director of the Rwandan
Office of Information, told Agence France Presse (AFP) in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Banyamurenges are an ethnic Tutsi people who are originally
from Rwanda but have long settled in eastern Zaire's mountainous
regions.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Burundian army said that Hutu
rebels attacked this morning the town of Cibitoke, 60 kilometers
north of the Burundian capital Bujumbura and a stream across the
Zairean border region of Uvira, which has been the battlefield
between Zairean troops and Banyamurenges in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
"The attack began nearly 07:00 in the morning and lasted about
an hour and a half," Lieutenant-Colonel Isaie Nibizi, a spokesman
of the Burundian Army, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
At least 83 people were killed and dozens more injured in the
past three days of fighting in eastern Zaire between Zairean
troops and Banyamurenges, according to coordinated reports.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 Hutu, Tutsi and Rwandan refugees have fled
their camps in Uvira, triggering another humanitarian crisis in
the region, said the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Zairean Prime Minister Leon Kengo wa Dondo today cut short a
visit in London and returned to Zaire, which he said has been the
"victim" of aggression by Rwanda and Burundi, two tiny states
bordering the central African regional giant.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has put some 40 large vehicles on the Rwandan border
with Zaire to prepare for the arrival of hundreds of thousands of
refugees fleeing eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has called on the Hutu refugees, who fled the country
after the 1994 genocide against Tutsis in the country, to return
home.
</P>
<P>
More than one million Hutu refugees have been living in eastern
Zaire's refugee camps since July 1994.

is considering selling its 57 percent equity holding in the
petroleum sector to private investors, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Finance Minister Chief Anthony Ani was quoted as saying
in Lagos on Monday that the government also intends to privatize the

</P>
<P>
The government is also willing to grant licences to competent

refineries in the country, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria also encourages foreign businesses to invest in the coal
industry through independent operations or joint ventures, he added.
</P>
<P>
The news agency also reported today that nigeria produced 2.06
million barrels of crude oil per day in 1995, a slight drop from the
2.1 million barrels in 1994, quoting latest figures released by the

<HEADLINE> Adviser to Arafat on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- An Palestinian senior official
affirmed that the Middle East peace process has come to the point
of no return, and that there is no alternative to setting up a
Palestinian state regardless of Israeli opposition.
</P>
<P>
This came in an exclusive interview given by Ghebrial Banu,
economic adviser to Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser
Arafat, which was published by the Tunisian newspaper "Assabah"
today.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for (Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin)
Netanyahu and his government to go back on the peace agreements
signed by the (previous) Peres government with Palestinian
National Authority, because the Peres government signed these
agreements in the name of Israel, not in the name of a party or
an organization," Banu said.
</P>
<P>
"The return of violence is the greatest danger threatening the
Middle East, as it is impossible to call on a party that is in a
tragic situation to keep patient, especially that the (Israeli)
siege makes the Palestinian Authority suffer a loss ranging from
6 to 7 million U.S. dollars a day. Therefore, the Palestinian
Authority budget has risen from 60 to 180 million dollars," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Banu, answering a question about the setting up of a
Palestinian state, said that Netanyahu does have neither the
power nor the right to say that no Palestinian state would emerge.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government led by Netanyahu has requested to
renegotiate the agreements signed between Israel and Palestine
and flatly opposed the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on French President Jacques Chirac's current
Mideast tour, Banu expressed his disbelief that no state other
than the U.S. is capable of putting real pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
France and the European Union are exerting efforts to bolster
their influence to promote the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Yet the meetings held by Israeli President Ezer Weizman and
former Prime Minister Shimon Peres with President Arafat at
present are very important," Banu argued.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Factional Leader Supports US Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The leader of a Kurdish faction
in northern Iraq said here tonight that he supports the United
States' proposal on cease-fire in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani
made the remarks after he met with U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Robert Pelletreau, who is trying to conclude a cease-fire
between the PUK and its rival Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).
</P>
<P>
Talabani said, "I support an immediate cease-fire without any
condition and I hope that the enmity and the flow of blood in
this region would come to an immediate end."
</P>
<P>
He said that he is ready to hold peace talks with KDP leader
Massoud Barzani, adding, "I have no (not) any condition for the
prevention of the flow of the blood and for the cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
He also thanked the United States, Britain and Turkey for
making initiatives for peace.
</P>
<P>
U.S. envoy Pelletreau expressed his satisfaction that both the
pro-Saddam KDP and the Iranian-backed PUK agreed that neither
Baghdad nor Tehran should be involved in the inter-Kurdish
fighting in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau said that the KDP and the PUK agreed that the
further negotiations between the two Kurdish groups would
continue as soon as the cease-fire is secured.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy said Monday that he found Barzani was willing
to conclude a cease-fire with its rival PUK during his meeting
with the KDP leader in the Turkish border town of Silopi, Sirnak
province, which borders northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He met with KDP and PUK officials last week in Washington in
an attempt to bring about a truce between the two sides and to
convince the KDP to cut its ties with the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Barzani threatened last week to call for help from Baghdad
again if things developed to the KDP's detriment on the
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
The KDP captured a series of major towns in northern Iraq in
a Baghdad-backed operation last month, forcing the U.S. to
evacuate many of its security and intelligence workers from the
region.
</P>
<P>
In a recent offensive, the PUK recaptured much of its last
ground including Sulaimaniyah, one of the biggest cities in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the KDP
and the PUK began fighting in 1994.

<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
met with a delegation from the International Congress of
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (ICIE) here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu commented that Russia-based ICIE has established good
relations with China Association for International Friendly
Contacts, and with China's industrial and business circles.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that ICIE's visit will enhance exchanges
and cooperation between the organization and Chinese enterprises,
as well as between Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
Wu briefed the visitors on China's reforms and opening-up, and
economic construction being carried out in line with Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
For a period of time from now, China will maintain a relatively
high growth rate while keeping inflation at a relatively low
level, he said. This will realize two fundamental changes -- the
shift in growth mode from extensive to intensive, and the shift
from planned economy to market economy -- and achieving a healthy
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that China's economic growth has constituted
favorable conditions for business circles in other countries to
strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Glukhikh said his organization has a strong interest in
cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed happiness over the establishment of relations
between the ICIE and Chinese business community, and hoped China

cooperation will be continuously expanded.

all countries as an international norm.
</P>
<P>
He further pointed out that all countries, big or small, strong
or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the international
community, and have the rights to equally participating
international affairs.

The Chinese government is willing to cooperate with the
international community in making efforts for the establishment of

<P>
The show features the latest audio-visual technology as
demonstrated in the digital video disc (DVD) and related
equipment, advanced photo system (APS) cameras, high-end hi-fi and
TV systems, home theater systems, multi-media equipment and
Internet services.
</P>
<P>
Richard Lee, chairman of the Radio Association of Hong Kong,
said at the opening ceremony that new technology and innovative
designs should help generate fresh consumer demand, enabling the
audio visual industry to play a leading role in reviving Hong
Kong's retail environment.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hong Kong's importance as a regional hub for
audio and visual trade, he said, "For overseas companies, Hong
Kong is an ideal springboard into the enormous China market, while
enterprises in China's inland areas see the territory as a
wide-open window for trade with the world."
</P>
<P>
Last year Hong Kong exported 125 billion HK dollars' (16.03
billion U.S. dollars) worth of audio-visual products, up 15
percent from 1994 and leading markets include China's inland
areas, the United States, Japan, Germany and Singapore. In the

<HEADLINE> Chirac Wins Hero's Welcome in Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today got a hero's welcome in the Palestinian self-rule area of
West Bank, said the local media.
</P>
<P>
"Vive Chirac," "Vive la France," "Vive la Palestine," shouted
the Palestinians who massed around a small airport in Ramallah as
Chirac landed in a Puma military helicopter of the French Air
Force, this morning.
</P>
<P>
Highly admired in Arab public opinion for his confrontation
with Israeli security forces during Tuesday's visit to East
Jerusalem, Chirac said the Palestinians should establish a state
which will co-exist in peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Palestinians to denounce hatred and violence.
</P>
<P>
"The legitimate aspiration of Israel for security should
overall be understood and agreed to," he said, while urging all
Palestinians to abandon extremism.
</P>
<P>
"Israel, assured of the peaceful intentions of its Arab
neighbors, will be convinced that the existence of a Palestinian
state, far from being a threat, will to the contrary make up an
element of its security," Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who, accompanied by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
visited Gaza late today.
</P>
<P>
Arafat appealed to Europe and France to play a bigger role in
the Middle East peace process, which, he said was experiencing an
"extremely delicate period."
</P>
<P>
"We turn to the President of the Republic, Doctor Chirac, for
helping us through this difficult period," said Arafat, likening
Chirac to a medical doctor curing the illness by the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> EDS-details added Chinese, Namibian Presidents Hold Talks in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said in Beijing today that China is ready to make joint efforts
with Namibia to raise the Sino-Namibian traditional friendship to
a new high.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark during talks with Namibian President Sam
Nujoma, who arrived in China on Monday for a week-long state visit
as Jiang's guest. Nujoma has just arrived in Beijing from a tour
of Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Nujoma, and calling him an old friend, familiar with
and respected by the Chinese people, Jiang recalled his visit to
Namibia in May.
</P>
<P>
He said that during that visit, the Namibian people's
friendship for Chinese people left him with a deep impression. He
believes that Nujoma's current visit to China is bound to turn a
new chapter for the further consolidation and development of
Sino-Namibian friendship.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said that the achievements made by China's Jiangxi
Province is encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon bilateral relations, Jiang said the distance
between the two countries does not hinder the friendship between
China and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The people of both countries formed a deep friendship when they
sympathized and supported each other in their fight against
imperialism and colonialism, Jiang continued.
</P>
<P>
After the two countries forged diplomatic relations, he noted
that bilateral relations developed smoothly, and there has been
frequent contact between leaders.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to develop sincere, friendly, equal, united,
cooperative ties with Namibia, aiming at a common development,
added Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said that the Chinese government and people have always
been Namibia's reliable friends during the Namibian people's
struggle for independence, and the construction drive afterwards,
and provided Namibian people with great support and aid.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic and trade relations, Jiang noted that
since the two countries established diplomatic relations, China
and Namibia have conducted effective and fruitful cooperation, and
bilateral economic cooperation has a vast potential.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy Up 9.6 Percent During First Nine Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy grew 9.6
percent in real terms during the first nine months over the same
period last year, with the GDP reaching 4,567.5 billion yuan,
according to an announcement made here today by Ye Zhen, a
spokesman for the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese industry realized an added value of
1,357.5 billion yuan during the first three quarters, up 12.9
percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
"The light and heavy industries grew almost in the same pace
and the product structure is further improved," he said. "Products
which have good market prospects, such as video machines,
computers and programmable exchanges, witnessed rapid growth."
</P>
<P>
"The sales ratio also witnessed gradual rises since the
beginning of the year."
</P>
<P>
Ye said that with a good harvest in summer grain and early
rice, a good autumn harvest is already certain.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that the total grain output would surpass 480
million tons, setting another historic record," he said. "However,
output of cotton and oil crops will decrease because of the
reduced acreage."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that China invested 827 billion yuan on
fixed assets investment during the January-September period, up
19.3 percent nominally but around 13 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
The country's real estate investment rose 31.9 percent on
nominal terms to 162.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's social retail sales volume grew 12.3
percent on nominal terms to 1,732.7 yuan during the first nine
months.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two interest rate cuts didn't cause panic to
consumers and that the retail sales market saw "no unusual
phenomena."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that China's total foreign trade volume hit
199.9 billion US dollars during the first nine months, up 1.1
percent on year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
The export dropped 2.7 percent to 104 billion US dollars while
the import rose 5.8 percent to 95.9 billion US dollars. China
enjoyed a trade surplus of 8.1 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that China can smoothly control the price hike within
the target of less than 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
China's retail price index rose 6.6 percent during the first
nine months, and the growth rate was ten percentage points less
than that for the same period last year. The country's consumer
price index rose 8.8 percent and the growth rate was 10.3
percentage points less.
</P>
<P>
He said that food prices rose stably but household electric
appliances, jewelry and machinary and electronic products became
cheaper during the first nine months.
</P>
<P>
"But rents for houses and prices of water and pipe gas saw
strong rises this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that during the first nine months, China's
urban residents' per capita living expense income grew 3.4 percent
in real terms to 3,249 yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the city residents' pockets are fattening at a
less speed this year and that the life of a number of the
low-income households has become more difficult.
</P>
<P>
He said a recent survey done in 35 major Chinese cities show
that during the first three quarters, the incomes of about 40
percent of the households decreased.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the Chinese farmers' per capita cash
income (including producing costs) rose 10 percent in real terms
to 1,350 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Bildt Calls for Deterrent Troops in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Carl Bildt, the European
Union's (EU) representative in Bosnia, called today for a
deterrent force to be stationed in the country after the mandate
of the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) expires on 20 December.
</P>
<P>
"That needs not necessarily be a large force. But it must be
able to deter and it must take the military option out of the
fields and the plans of all of the political actors on both sides
and in all three ethnic communities," said Bildt.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking after his meeting with NATO Secretary General,
Javier Solana, and NATO's permanent Council this morning.
</P>
<P>
As for the delay of Bosnia's municipal elections, Bildt said he
welcomed the decision by the organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Robert Frowick, head of the OSCE announced that
the elections had been postponed until 1997 "due to continuing
political problems".
</P>
<P>
Bildt said: "It gives us a somewhat greater amount of time to
deliver the quality the elections would need at the local level in
Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the "solemn declaration", an oath of loyalty to
the state, which was signed Wednesday by the Serb member of
Bosnia's new collective presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik, Bildt said
"it has given us the possibility of speeding up the work of
setting up common institutions of the country".

<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng has
inspected the site of the Three Gorges Project, and expressed
satisfaction at the resettlement work.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project, which was approved at the Fifth
Session of the Seventh People's National Congress in 1992 and
started in 1994, is projected to resettle a total of 1,800,000
people, who live in the dam area.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the success of the project hinges on the
resettlement of people surrounding the huge reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Before the construction work started, Li Peng warned that the
resettlement was associated with social stability, and China's
image in the world.
</P>
<P>
During his 4-day visit between October 17 and 20, the premier
toured Fuling and Wanxian in Sichuan Province, and Yichang in
Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The premier told local officials in Wanxian City and Zigui
County that priority should be given to the construction of
infrastructure facilities, the relocation of enterprises, and
resettlement of citizens, when it comes to the relocation of towns
and cities.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the resettlement work should take a
practical and realistic approach, since China is not rich enough,
and should be thrifty and effective in the way things are run.
</P>
<P>
He said that governments at all levels should encourage, and
protect people's enthusiasm and creativity, and pay compensation
timely to those who move.
</P>
<P>
Many enterprises and departments have already begun to launch
projects around the reservoir area. The premier pointed out
that it is necessary to create and provide an ideal investment
environment for non-local investors, in line with the principle of
mutual benefit and reciprocity, and long-term cooperation under
the conditions of a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
About 800 projects, involving a total investment of 1.4 billion
yuan, are already underway around the reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged people surrounding the reservoir area to seize an
opportunity unprecedented in history, to develop themselves, and
blaze a new path of casting off poverty and getting rich.

BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Ari Vatanen of Finland
maintained a 1-minute 27-second lead in the Hong Kong-Beijing
Rally Wednesday, boosting his chances of becoming the first driver

</P>
<P>
Vatanen, who won the rally in 1993, nearly struck disaster

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian official said

Organization is designed to promote regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Sidorov told a news conference
that Russia expects the meeting, which opens in Moscow on Friday,
to "give a strong impetus to the development of cooperation in the
region, and set the main guidelines which will make it possible to
expand the sphere of joint actions."
</P>
<P>
During the six-month chairmanship of Russia, an agreement on
the creation of the Black Sea Bank for Trade and Development was
put into effect, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Active on Protection of Trademark Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China has established a law
enforcement system from central to local levels to protect
trademark rights, an official at the State Administration for
Industry and Commerce (SAIC) has reported in Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
During an international symposium on protection of intellectual
property rights in the city, Ou Wanxiong, vice chief of SAIC's
Trademark Examination Committee, said there are 7,000 law
enforcers to protect trademark rights nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In a speech, Development of China's Trademark Law System, Ou
told participants that China handled 19,300 cases involving
violations of trademark rights last year, nearly 7,000 more than
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
China enacted a trademark law in 1982, which was revised in
1993. In the same year, the National People's Congress, the
Chinese parliament, issued complementary regulations on
punishments for crimes of imitating registered trademarks,
according to Ou.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, businesses from 78 countries and
regions registered 77,800 trademarks in China. Nearly 170,000 new
trademark registration applications were made last year, with more
than 20,000 from overseas.

<HEADLINE> China To Step Up Reforms On Foreign Language Teaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China plans to take measures to
advance its foreign language teaching in junior and senior middle
schools, according to a report from the State Educational
Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
"To educate more people in foreign languages, and to improve
foreign language teaching methods, is no longer a question of
teaching and learning, but one that has great bearing on
implementation of the China's policy of reforms and opening up,
and on promotion of the country's social and economic
development," Vice-Premier Li Lanqing told a meeting on foreign
language teaching in primary and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
The report says foreign language teaching in the basic
educational stage is not able to meet the demands of the country's
reforms and opening up, and expansion of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
"It takes more time, and gives less results," the report says.
</P>
<P>
It says by the end of 1995, only 73.7 percent of English
teachers in junior middle schools, and 39.4 percent in senior
middle schools met standards set by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
In China, junior middle school teachers must have a diploma for
college students or above, while teachers in senior middle schools
need a university diploma.
</P>
<P>
The report say the SEC has decided to hold a national working
conference on foreign language teaching and learning this
year to draw up concrete measures to promote the development of
the country's foreign language teaching.
</P>
<P>
So far, foreign language teaching, along with Chinese and
mathematics, has become the main curricula for middle school
students across the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, more than 99 percent of junior and
senior middle school students learn English, and in some big or
medium-sized cities, and in the developed coastal areas, pupils
in primary schools have begun to learn English.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 445,000 middle school English teachers, and
5,600 Japanese and Russian teachers.
</P>
<P>
To improve the foreign language teaching methodology, a
teaching and learning method, called "Zhang Sizhong Model," will
be spread in middle schools nationwide. Zhang, who created the
method, is an English teacher from the No.1 Affiliated Middle
School of the East China Teachers' University.

<HEADLINE> French Newspapers Praise Chirac's Stance in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- French newspapers today highly
praised President Jacques Chirac's indignant reaction against the
provocative behavior by Israeli police during his tour of East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Chirac Tuesday lashed out at the provocative behavior of
Israeli security forces who deliberately tried to prevent him
from meeting the Palestinian people who came to welcome him in the
old city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro daily said in an editorial that "facing up to the
(Israeli) soldiers, Chirac imposes his large physical presence,
which is supported by his important status.
</P>
<P>
"Jacques Chirac knows well that an image is worth one thousand
speeches. His fury as that of the President of France is highly
symbolic. Everybody understands his message: in Jerusalem, France
wants to see justice prevail."
</P>
<P>
The evening paper France Soir said that while other European
countries failed to take a common stand against the intransigence
of Benjamin Netanyahu, "France has become a lonely knight fighting
to impose Europe by the side of the United States at the peace
negotiation table" of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party newspaper L'Humanite said that President
Chirac was right to erupt in anger in Jerusalem. It condemned
Israel for rudely treating a foreign head of state.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper La Republique des Pyrennes said that since
Europe had been excluded by the United States and Israel from the
peace talks in the Middle East, President Chirac had to say it
with force: Israel must recognize an independent Palestinian
state, return the Golan Heights to Syria, and withdraw from South
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The daily La Depeche du Midi said that "since the new Israeli
government encouraged all kinds of action to apply its
ultra-conservative policy, Tuesday's incidents in Jeruslam did not
surprise anyone, although it proved a brutal attitude by Israel to
humiliate, if not maltreat, France via its head of state."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper La Liberte de L'Est said that Chirac's action in
Jerusalem symbolized the refusal of France to recognize Israel's
sovereignty over East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Ouest-France daily said that "far from giving up when
seeing the Oslo peace treaties dying away, Chirac at least did all
that he could to save the peace process. Jacques Chirac has a lot
to gain in case of success, and has nothing to lose in case of
failure."
</P>
<P>
The daily L'Est Republicain said: "At least through this event,
Jacques Chirac is the decent inheritor of General Charles de
Gaulle."
</P>
<P>
"Instead of using subtle allusions and implications when
conveying his protest, Chirac hit straight out. This way of doing
things reveals what is in him: Courage, readiness to fight for the
cause which he thinks is just, and rejection of the routine of
official trips," said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
La Lettre de la Nation daily said it called for courage for a
head of state to engage security forces which were excessive.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond this unfortunate incident, it is possible that slowly,
the message of the President of the Republic of France will make
its way into the spirit and heart of the Israelis,'' said the
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia's Trade Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ulan Bator, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's foreign trade
volume increased slightly in the first nine months of this year,
reaching 670 million U.S. dollars, Montsame News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented an increase of 40 million dollars over
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
During the first three quarters of this year, exports reached
about 350 million dollars while imports were about 320 million
dollars, leaving a 30 million dollar surplus.
</P>
<P>
But exports showed a shrinking trend during the period because
prices of some of Mongolia's traditional exports, such as cashmere
wool, plunged on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's main trade partners include Russia, Japan, China,
Switzerland, the United states, Singapore and Italy.

<HEADLINE> Russian Lawmakers Slam Budget Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian's State Duma (Lower
House of the Parliament) on Wednesday condemned the government's
performance with the 1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
About 289 Duma deputies voted for a resolution against the
government's work this year after Finance Minister Alexander
Livshits gave a report on the execution of the 1996 budget, said
the Interfax News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a plenary session of the Duma, Livshits, who is
also the Deputy Prime Minister, admitted that fulfilling the 1996
budget was "extremely strenuous."
</P>
<P>
He said all the budget items were underfinanced and the tax
collection became difficult.
</P>
<P>
The resolution by the lawmakers criticized the government for
altering the structure of spending on items, breaking the rules
for establishing and spending federal funds to support regions and
misusing targeted budget money.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's financial system is functioning in unstable and
crisis conditions. The reduction of inflation is being carried out
against the background of a falling gross domestic product,
falling investments, and companies' worsening financial standings,
which are leading to a deeper economic crisis," the resolution
said.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers suggested that the government take concrete steps
to improve tax collection and other mandatory payments and budget
revenues.
</P>
<P>
They also called for offsetting the debts of all budgets.
</P>
<P>
They urged the government to inform the Duma by December 1 of
measures taken in line with the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Just a week ago, the State Duma rejected the draft budget for
1997. It was described as "unrealistic."
</P>
<P>
The government is now re-working the 1997 budget to try to make
it acceptable.

MOSCOW, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Defender Sergei Timofeyev, who
plays for Russian champions Alania Vladikavkaz, was banned for 10
games by the League's disciplinary committee on Wednesday for
breaking an opponent's cheekbone with his elbow.
</P>
<P>
Timofeyev was originally suspended for an unlimited period
after he elbowed Lokomotiv Moscow's Andrei Solomatin during a 0-0
draw in September.
</P>
<P>
The committee had decided to limit the punishment to a 10-game
ban after hearing evidence that Solomatin was recovering faster
than expected.
</P>
<P>
Timofeyev, who has already been sidelined for three games,
will miss the vital final two games of the season and the first
five matches of the next term.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Kazakhstan Defence Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) --Defence ministers from China and
Kazakhstan today stressed the need to enhance cooperation between
the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
This was stated during talks in Beijing today between Chinese
Defence Minister Chi Haotian, and Kazakhstan Defense Minister
Alibek Kasymov.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also Vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and
a State Councillor, said that relations between the two armed
forces is an important component of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"China attaches great importance to developing friendly
cooperation with Kazakhstan, and would join efforts with
Kazakhstan to improve friendly relations between the two
countries, and the two armed forces," said Chi.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the visitors on China's defence policy, General Chi
stressed that China pursues a defensive policy. He added that the
so-called " China Threat", spread by some westerners, is totally
groundless and has an ulterior motive.
</P>
<P>
The general said that the five-country agreement signed by
Russian, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Chinese heads of
state in Shanghai in April, on strengthening confidence in the
military field in border areas, is not only conducive to the
stability and security in the border areas of the five nations,
but also to world peace and stability at large.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is itself evidence to counter the "China Threat"
fallacy, Chi said.
</P>
<P>
Chi expressed thanks for Kazakhstan's stance on the issues of
Taiwan and Tibet, and its policy of opposing national splittism.
</P>
<P>
Kasymov spoke highly of China's long-term efforts to maintain
stability and peace in the Asia-Pacific region, and the world as a
whole, adding that the efforts have won world-wide respect.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Kazakhstan's "one China" position on the issue of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Chi presided over a welcoming ceremony in
Kasymov's honor.
</P>
<P>
Kasymov and his entourage arrived in Beijing on Tuesday from
Urumqi for an official, good-will visit, as guests of Chi
Haotian.

PHNOM PENH, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians gathered at the Royal Palace Square here today to mark
the 5th anniversary of the Paris Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the National Assembly, on behalf
of King Norodom Sihanouk, highly praised the accord, signed in
Paris on October 23, 1991.

October 23, 1991, was the historic day which ushered in a new
era of national reconciliation, peace, democracy and national
reconstruction, Samdech told the mass gathering.
</P>
<P>
He said the accord had not only brought peace and national
reunification and reconstruction, but it was also an international
treaty that recognizes and protects Cambodia as an independent,
sovereign, neutral, non-aligned country with territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, Cambodia had made great achievements
in various aspects, added the chairman.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jagland To Succeed Brundtland as Norwegian P.M. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Labor Party leader Thorbjoern
Jagland will succeed Gro Harlem Brundtland, the most influential
figure in Norwegian politics, on Friday as Norway's new prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland, who has dominated the Scandinavian country's
politics for the past 15 years, announced today that she was
stepping down.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise announcement to parliament, the veteran
politician said she would deliver a letter of resignation at a
regular cabinet meeting on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are heading for a new parliamentary election (in November
1997) and a new four-year legislature," she told parliament. "I
feel it is proper that the government's leadership and set-up be
clarified well ahead of the election."
</P>
<P>
"In light of this background I have told the king that I will
submit my resignation in a cabinet session on Friday," she said.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old Brundtland was prime minister for eight months
in 1981, and from 1986 to 1989 and again from 1990 until now -- a
total of almost 12 years in office. She was also Norway's first
female prime minister.
</P>
<P>
She had said she wanted to quit, but the timing was a surprise
as an announcement was expected at the party's November convention.
</P>
<P>
There had also been speculation that Brundtland might resign
well before the general elections to seek an office at the United
Nations or another international body.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, she surprised a Labor party convention by
announcing her withdrawal from the position of the party leader
while continuing as prime minister. The convention elected Jagland
as the new party leader.

<P>
DALIAN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The new diesel train that will
speed up China's rail system is about to go into mass production.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian Rolling Stock Plant in northeast China's Liaoning
Province developed the Dongfeng-4D Passenger Train Locomotive, to
meet the country's need to increase train speed.
</P>
<P>
The new-type diesel locomotive, which has recently passed an
appraisal by the Ministry of Railways, will soon go into mass
production. China plans to increase its passenger train speed to
120 km/hour in 1997 on four trunk railways, Beijing-Guangzhou,
Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Harbin and Harbin-Dalian.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the locomotive, which uses some imported
components, can tow 20 king-size coaches at an hourly speed of 120
kilometers and generate 2,940 kilowatts of power.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Rolling Stock Plant will turn 50 such locomotives in the
first quarter of next year, and 150 in the whole year.

The latest version of the draft law on rural enterprises have
new regulations to protect their legal properties. The investors
of rural enterprises have the right to make major decisions, and
the ventures have independent accounting, and manage their
business operations independently.
</P>
<P>
The other three draft laws have also been revised according to
the deliberation of opinions and suggestions from relevant
departments.
</P>
<P>
The formulation of the law on partnership businesses is another
step to regulate the components of the emerging Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Issues on the establishment, property, operation of
partnership, relations with a third party, disbanding, account
settlement, and legal duties of partners, are defined in the draft.
</P>
<P>
The draft states that legal entities may become partners, but
stops short of deciding how state enterprises may be involved in a
partnership. Many fear that would lead to the loss of state
property in its present form.
</P>
<P>
"The State Council will be given the power to make a specific
measure on this issue," the draft says.

Sending the People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops to Hong Kong
on July 1, 1997 has become a matter of concern among Hong Kong

criminal and civil cases, involving officers and men stationed
there, are to be handled by military or local courts, depending on
whether they involve official duties.

"The stipulations were based on the Basic Law of HK SAR, and
with reference to British Army practice in Hong Kong," A top

bilateral and international issues, is beneficial to both
countries.

bid to enter the World Trade Organization. He also conveyed an
invitation by the country's Secretary of Foreign Relations to Qian
to visit Mexico, which Qian gladly accepted.

<P>
HARARE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition United
Parties (UP) said here today the ongoing strike by doctors and
nurses shows Zimbabweans had lost their patience in the ZANU PF
government.
</P>
<P>
UP Publicing Secretary Isaac Manyemba said the ZANU PF
government had failed to govern the nation and should resign
immediately and call for fresh parliamentary and presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
He said UP President Abel Muzorewa had already formed a
government in-waiting as it was clear that ZANU PF could no
longer correct its 16 years of misgovernance.
</P>
<P>
"An industrial action by doctors and nurses should be
responded to wisely and swiftly because they deal with human
life," he said.
</P>
<P>
The nurses went on strike in August and were joined by the
rest of the civil service a day later. The strike went on for
more than two weeks, ending after the government had awarded them
a 20 percent salary increase and promised to look into the rest
of the grievances.

MOGADISHU, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leadrs are
reacting differently following their recent ceasefire agreement
brokered by Kenya in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Osman Haddan Ali Atto are saying that
they will go to the northeastern port town of Bossaso for a
meeting with other Somali factions and are calling on their arch
rival Hussein Aidid to join the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In response, Hussein Aidid said today in his first speech
since the Nairobi ceasefire talks three days ago that the
existence of the government formed by his late father is
unnegotiable.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his supporters over radio, Hussein Aidid said his
meeting with some Somali factions including Ali Mahdi Mohamed in
Nairobi has not deterred his attitude towards the national
govemment of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"The meetings in Nairobi were merely an exchange of views,"
said Aidid. However, he pledged he would continue dialogues
concerning peace promotion, unity and the interest of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
During the 15-minute long speech, Hussein Aidid said in
Nairobi he met with foreign diplomats and representatives from
the international relief agencies, who said they are willing to
reopen their missions in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
He commended Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi for his role
in brokering ceasefire in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"He is a great African leader and a friend of the Somali
people in particular with my late father," said Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The south Mogadishu faction leader said the killings,
abductions, looting and raping were dreadful acts in the horn of
Africa country and its war-torn capital city and his government
would take tough measures against outlawed elements.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the secession of the break away Republic of
Somali Land would come to an end very soon, but he did not
mention when and how the secessionists would renounced the policy
they had adopted since 1991.

the local daily "the New Vision" quoted a government official as

distribution, disease and lack of resistant crops.

There was drought by the end of June following a rainy season
in March and April. This led to poor yield of maize and other

<P>
HARARE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi today urged countries in the southern African
region to coordinate polices to boost regional trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the two-day Southern African Trade and
Investment Summit in Harare, Mocumbi said one of the major issues
to be resolved was to coordinate development strategies adopted
by members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
He noted that while the region had managed to achieve
political and economic stability, there was a need to deepen
economic ties by taking advantage of each other's areas of
comparative advantages.
</P>
<P>
Despite the signing of a regional trade protocol at SADC's
annual congress in Lesotho last July, some countries have not yet
taken actions to implement it.
</P>
<P>
"We in Mozambique are developing the Beira Corridor Route in
order to facilitate regional integration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is currently undergoing economic reforms to create
a conducive environment for investors.
</P>
<P>
The summit, organized by the International Herald Tribune, was
aimed at assessing the investment and trade opportunities in
southern Africa as the region moved increasingly towards
market-oriented economic policies.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The UN special envoy to
Afghanistan, Norbert Holl, today failed to broker a ceasefire
agreement among Afghan warring factions, said a report reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
Holl held detailed talks today with Afghan Uzbek Militia leader
Rashid Dostum and visiting Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah
Babar in Mazar-i-Sharif, Dostum's headquarters in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The report coming from Mazar-i-Sharif quoted Holl as saying
that the discussions on ceasefire were very tough.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, to be honest, there is no guarantee of
success," he admitted.
</P>
<P>
Dostum Tuesday linked the ceasefire to a Taliban withdrawal
from the Afghan capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"If the Taliban do not agree to our terms and do not leave
Kabul, they will be responsible for future fighting," Dostum's
spokesman Mohammad Yusif said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ousted government troops led by Ahmad Shah Masood linked
the ceasefire to the "demilitarization" of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban Militia Monday agreed to a conditional ceasefire if
an exchange of POWs could take place simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and Masood's men are reportedly locked in fierce
fighting near Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Holl's visit to Afghanistan followed a UN call for an immediate
ceasefire between warring factions in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution Tuesday, the UN Security Council urged all
sides in Afghanistan to negotiate a political settlement.

<HEADLINE> Australian Minister Defends Publication of Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Australian Federal Schools
Minister David Kemp today defended his plan to publish school
results of basic skills tests, denying that schools with lower
rankings would lose funding.
</P>
<P>
Parents in Australia were shocked to learn about the low
literacy levels of their children when Kemp said on Monday night
that a 1995 survey found literate inadequacy in 30 percent of
14-year-old grade-nine students.
</P>
<P>
Between 1975 and 1995, four surveys were carried out to assess
the abilities of 28,000 students by the Australian Council for
Educational Research.
</P>
<P>
The literate inadequacy figure in 1995 was slightly up from 28
percent in 1975.
</P>
<P>
"Parents have a right to be informed about the progress of
their children. If the facts had been released as they could have
been, then perhaps this problem might have been addressed much
more effectively," Kemp told ABC's Radio National.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly education policy and practice has failed to improve
the literacy standards of a significant proportion of young
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Literacy levels among Australian school boys declined over the
past 20 years, with 35 percent of those surveyed in 1995 not
meeting the standard, compared with 30 percent in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Literacy rates among school girls remained relatively steady in
the period, with the substandard rate standing at 26 percent in
1975 and at 27 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Kemp noted that there was a direct link between poor literacy
levels, school drop-out rates and youth unemployment.
</P>
<P>
He said that students who dropped out before grade 12 were
two-and-a-half times more likely to be unemployed than those who
completed the secondary school.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Probe Into Massive Fishkill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Environment
and Natural Resources of the Philippines has asked the National
Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to probe into the cause of the
recent massive fishkill in Manila Bay.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported today that the department
has submitted to the NBI a list of 19 firms which may be involved
in the fishkill.
</P>
<P>
The department said that four mining firms and two
manufacturers of activated carbon are direct users of cyanide
which was found to be the culprit of the death of some 30,000
kilograms of fish in Manila Bay.
</P>
<P>
The other 15 firms may be cyanide importers, but the NBI
officials said they would carefully look into their records.
</P>
<P>
As speculations still arise as to who is the real culprit in
the massive fishkill, two theories have evolved in the
investigation of the case.
</P>
<P>
The first theory attributed the fishkill to "accidental
dumping" of cyanide into the bay by an importer while transferring
the chemical from the main vessel to the barge. The Second said
the cyanide was dumped into the bay through sewers.

NEW DELHI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) started a
four-day senior officials meeting here today to seek ways to
improve infrastructure facilities in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled to review developments in the

major issues in infrastructure development, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech, India's Surface Transport Minister

concerns arising from infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
"While there is an urgent need for accelerated growth of
infrastructure, there can be no doubt that this growth must be
environment friendly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Asia is home to the majority of the world's poor,
he said that senior government officials should focus on their
upliftment through infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials meeting is the first segment of the ESCAP
conference to be followed by a ministerial meeting on October
28-29 and the World Infrastructure Forum -- Asia 1996 on October

<HEADLINE> Business Partnership Law Submitted to China's Top Legislature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A draft of the Business
Partnership Law was for the first time submitted to China's top
legislature here today.
</P>
<P>
"Formulating a law on partnerships is a key part of legislation
on the market economy in China, and of establishing a legal
framework for a socialist market economy," a senior law-maker said.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises have played an important role in economic
development, increasing employment, and improving people's lives,
said Huang Yicheng, vice-director of the Financial and Economic
Committee of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Huang provided an explanation of the draft today at the 22nd
session of the NPC Standing Committee, which opened in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
The draft defines business partnerships as involving two or
more partners who provide funds, obtain profits, and share risks
together for a common economic purpose. At least one of the
partners must bear responsibility for the company's debt.
</P>
<P>
China has seen rapid development of partnerships since its
reforms and opening up started in 1979, and there were nearly
120,000 business partnerships in China by the end of 1995, which
were a major part of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
However, Huang said, there are many difficulties and problems
with the enterprises. Sometimes the company's property can not be
adequately protected, or their normal production and operations
are disrupted, or their operations are chaotic, or their
responsibilities are not clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
The draft consists of 102 articles in 10 chapters, defining
establishment, property, operation, relations with third persons,
partnership, disbanding, account settlement, and legal duties of
partners.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yicheng said that the state encourages the development of
partnerships, and has simplified the procedures for the
establishment of business partnerships.

<HEADLINE> India's Postal, Telecom Employees Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian postal and telecom
employees started a nationwide indefinite strike today for bonus
payment.
</P>
<P>
About one million postal and telecom employees stopped work
throughout the country after talks between the government and
representatives of the trade unions failed to resolve the dispute
over disparity in the payment of bonus, said O.P. Gupta, secretary
general of the National Federation of Telecom Employees (NFTE).
</P>
<P>
Employees from the postal and telecom department have demanded
productivity linked bonus to group "c" and "d" employees at par
with the railway employees.
</P>
<P>
Trade union leaders warned that the agitation would continue if
the government did not come out with a positive decision on their
demands at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Hit by the total strike, the post and telegraph departments
wore a deserted look in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The government declared that the strike was illegal and called
for unconditional withdrawal. Union Communications Minister Beni
Prasad Verma in a press conference here today said that there was
no need for the employees to go on strike as the government was
sympathetic to their demands.
</P>
<P>
Instructions have been issued to all departmental heads to deal
with the situation to ensure that the public were not subjected to
inconvenience, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Urged to Control Its Foreign Exchange Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A scholar of the Research
Institute of Finance and Banking of the People's Bank of China has
said that China should keep its foreign exchange reserves within a
reasonable range.
</P>
<P>
"Although a certain amount of foreign exchange reserves are
necessary to ensure a country's viability, this does not mean that
the more foreign exchange reserves there are, the better," noted
Lin Zhiyuan, of the Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserves surpassed 95 billion US
dollars by the end of September, up almost 21.4 billion US dollars
from last year, and about 4.5 times those at the end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
"The strong increase in foreign exchange reserves since 1994
has had a negative effect on the domestic money supply," Lin told
a seminar on securities fund management, pointing out that it
forced China to spend 566.2 billion yuan in procuring foreign
exchange in 1994 and 1995, which in part contributed to the high
inflation at that time.
</P>
<P>
Lin said she expects another 30 billion-US-dollar increase in
China's foreign exchange reserves this year, meaning that the
state has to set aside another 250 billion yuan to purchase
foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
According to international financial practice, the ideal size
for a country's foreign exchange reserves is believed to be a
combination of the amount of foreign hard currency it needs to pay
for three to four months' worth of imports and 10 percent of its
outstanding foreign debt, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
"Based on this calculation, I believe that our country's
foreign exchange reserves should stand somewhere between 50
billion and 60 billion US dollars," she explained.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor, Dai Xianglong, has said that growth
of China's foreign exchange reserves will slow down in the years
to come.
</P>
<P>
Lin also denied the likelihood that China would manipulate the
international foreign exchange market by using its massive foreign
exchange reserves, which are expected to exceed 100 billion US
dollars by the year's end.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have a fairly large amount of foreign exchange
reserves, the possibility of China's manipulating the world
foreign exchange market simply does not exist," Lin emphasized.

determination to consolidate peace and stability, and to improve
further the regional investment climate for more secure entry and
participation of international investors in the various
infrastructural and other development projects.''
</P>
<P>
He stressed that discussions at this conference should result
in the reaffirmation of policies designed to improve
intra-regional trade and investment opportunities that can also
be taken advantage of by joint venture companies that include
indigenous partners.
</P>
<P>

<P>
PARIS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Jacques Chirac staged his own Intifada (uprising) Tuesday in
Jerusalem. One has never seen a foreign head of state yelling in
front of the camera at the members of security service who were
supposed to protect him. Chirac could not bear the brutal ways of
Israeli security service members, whom he had asked not to
accompany him during his tour of the holy sites within the old
city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
This grave diplomatic incident took place one day after the
president called for the existence of an independent Palestinian
state, an option rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
-- Two years after the exodus of more than a million Hutus who
fled Rwanda after a genocide against the Tutsis took place, the
United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is again
facing "an extremely emergency situation" in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
After fighting broke out between Zairean troops and the
Banyamurenges, a people who were originally from Rwanda but have
long lived in Zaire, some 230,000 Hutu refugees fled their camps
in the area of Ruzizi, north of Uvira which is near the Burundian
border.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said that most of the refugees are now hiding in
nearby plantations, while others are trudging under heavy rain
towards Bukavu, 120 kilometers north of Uvira.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The second day of the visit by President Jacques Chirac to
Israel was enameled with incidents during his tour in the old city
of Jerusalem. Letting his anger erupt in front of dozens of
Israeli security force members who tried to prevent him from
meeting the mass of Palestinians waiting to see him, Chirac
threatened to cut short the most eventful stage of his present
tour in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM: Boat Collision Understandable in Persian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati today made the first comment on the collision
between an American warship and an Iranian patrol boat, saying
that "it is quite understandable and predictable."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government had kept silent for 10 days over the
collision incident in the Persian Gulf on October 13.
</P>
<P>
The 84-meter long Iranian boat called "Bayandor" hit American
cruiser Gettysburg on the side as both were patrolling the
Persian Gulf waters. The American boat was slightly damaged.
</P>
<P>
The Gettysburg was escorting USS Enterprise aircraft carrier
which is enforcing no-fly restrictions over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said "the collision was quite accidental and it was
not intentional"
</P>
<P>
He added that it is quite understandable if there is accidental
collision between two boats or one boat and one ship in such a
very small area with a lot of ships and warships from the
regional countries and other countries.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Saddam's Rapprochement Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati said here today that Iran welcomes Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's rapprochement bid in his message to Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
"The message by the Iraqi leader was positive. Baghdad wants to
have good ties with us and we welcome that gesture," Velayati said
at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"Many of our prominent problems such as return of prisoners of
war and those missing in action have been resolved," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to go into detail about the message which
was delivered to the Iranian president by a special envoy of
Saddam Hussein on October 15. Both sides refused to reveal the
identity of the envoy.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that this was the first time for a
high-ranking government official to make such positive comment on
Saddam's message.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Iranian News Agency, the Iraqi envoy
voiced Iraq's desire for a good neighborly relation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
He also called for cooperation and exchange of views between
the two countries on regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Rafsanjani underlined the need for making efforts to
solve the issue of war prisoners and to completely enforce all
articles of the U.N. Resolution 598 on the ceasefire between the
two warring parties.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani also underscored the importance of good neighborly
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian president still regards Saddam Hussein as
a major threat to the peace and tranquility in the region.
</P>
<P>
He told German Weekly Der Spiegel recently "if they are given a
free hand they will destabilize the region, and they do still have
a lot of capabilities in that regard."
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought a eight-year war from 1980 to 1988. Iran
wants to normalize relations with the former enemy, but there are
some big problems, including the prisoners of war, which block the
way for improvement of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries agreed and maintained a ceasefire
since August, 1988, there is no real peace between the two
rivals. During the past years, both sides reported ceasefire
violations to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In the border areas, there exists a state of "no war and no
peace." The two countries still keep a large number of their
armed forces along the borders.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy Projected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It said the expected continuing tight monetary and fiscal
policy by the authorities would account for the slower growth. But
it noted that the growth would be supported by a strong domestic
sector while the net external position is expected to improve.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's GDP growth was at 9.5 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The MIER said unemployment would be at 2.8 percent for both
1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
It forecast a higher growth in exports over imports, with a
merchandise surplus expected to be at 4.575 billion ringgit (about
1.83 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996 and set to increase to 7.298
billion ringgit (about 2.919 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The MIER said the services deficit would amount to 20.246
billion ringgit (about 8.098 billion dollars) in 1996 and 22.554
billion ringgit (about 9.022 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This means the current account balance would be in a deficit of
15.272 billion ringgit (about 6.109 billion dollars) this year,
which would decline to 14.854 billion ringgit (about 5.942 billion
dollars) next year.
</P>
<P>
However, the MIER said the slowdown in exports growth could
turn out to be sharper than anticipated toward the year-end and
into the first-half of 1997 while imports of intermediate and
capital goods could start to pick up again resulting in a larger
deficit.
</P>
<P>
A deteriorating external sector results in unfavorable
sentiment on the local currency ringgit, together with its
implications on the response of monetary policy, it said.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates are forecast to remain firm in this year's
fourth quarter with three-month rates to be in the range of
7.2-7.5 percent, while the ringgit is expected to be in the range
of 2.51-2.54 against the U.S. dollar in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The MIER said the still firm rates were needed to maintain a
tight monetary policy to cap inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Also, with inflation in the range of 3.5-4 percent, and
coupled with rapid growth in consumption credit, it said, the
authorities would not be forthcoming in easing monetary conditions
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that monetary policy would remain tight for the
rest of this year and probably into the early part of 1997 at
least.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Protection In Northern Chinese Grassland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Erlian Oilfield in Inner
Mongolia has spent 36 million yuan in recent years building a
200-kilometer asphalt road, putting an end to a period in history
when all sorts of vehicles could be seen running helter-skelter on
the region's grasslands.
</P>
<P>
Gao Yun, an official in Xilin Gol League (prefecture) where the
oilfield is located, noted that, in 1985, vehicles on the
grassland produced dozens and dozens of parallel roads, often
destroying the grass, leading to desertification, and with the
strong winds, "as much as 240,000 ha of grassland have been
affected in Xilin Gol League."
</P>
<P>
Jin Qichang, deputy manager of the oilfield, said that the
deteriorating state of the grassland has mostly been stopped in
recent years, thanks to the efforts of officials and local people,
saving an area that could feed 50,000 sheep.
</P>
<P>
Jin said that the oilfield believes planning facilities for
preventing and treating pollution should be put into operation
with the construction project itself, and when the project is
completed, environmental protection departments should conduct
routine checkups. Those failing to meet the requirements do not
get paid or may be fined.
</P>
<P>
He said that the oilfield has invested three million yuan in
restoring grasslands damaged or polluted by oilfield workers, and
make sure that that no violators of environmental laws and
regulations go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
Jin claims that the company has issued as many as 300,000
pieces of material and offered 51 training classes so that every
worker can learn the laws and regulations, and concludes that "the
company's aim is to make every worker realize that we are not only
building our national economy, but also protecting the
environment."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Techniques For Disposing Of Paper Mill Waste Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed a technique for dealing with the waste of paper mills
that has polluted many rivers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 10,000 paper mills, most of them causing
pollution. Some 99 percent of them are medium-sized or small ones
using cornstalks and rice straw as raw materials, and tackling
their waste water problem in a cheap way has been a major headache
for them and for environmental protection experts.
</P>
<P>
The new technique was part of a state-level science and
technology project during the Ninth Five-Year Plan, officials from
the State Environmental Protection Bureau said here today. It eas
developed by the China Research Center for Water Pollution and
Water Re-use, and was approved by the State Science and Technology
Commission and Beijing Municipal Committee for Science and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
It involves a chemical displacement method with waste water
that could produce sediment, removing the pollutants. Over 1,000
lab and plant experiments have be done before the technique is
used.
</P>
<P>
With the new technique, the total investment for waste water
disposal for a paper mill producing 10,000 tons of paper annually
will be under three million yuan (370,000 dollars). Experts and
environmentalists are urging the authorities to make an effort to
popularize the new technique.
</P>
<P>
China has closed over 1,500 small mills in the past four
months, including 1,171 along the Huaihe River in central China,
in an effort to halt the deterioration of the river.
</P>
<P>
China is a big paper manufacturer, with annual pulp production
capacity of 15 million tons, ranking third in the world, but with
a per capita paper use of 12 kilograms, about one-third of the
world average.
</P>
<P>
Imported pulp costs China 300 million dollars annually.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Indonesia's Tourism Industry Growing Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia, a sprawling
archipelago with a cultural diversity dating back to the Stone Age
with sophisticated ancient court traditions, has ambitions to
receive 11 million foreign tourists with an earning of 15 billion
U.S. dollars by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
With the number of foreign tourists visiting Indonesia rising
by an annual increase of more than 30 percent in the past three
decades, the country's tourism authorities hope to make tourism a
pillar industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Tourist Organization (WTO), in the year
2000 there will be 700 million people visiting other
places/countries with East Asia and the Pacific region registering
the highest growth.
</P>
<P>
By then, the WTO said, Indonesia will become one of the major
destinations for foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign tourist arrivals in Indonesia stood at
4.06 million in 1994. The figure rose to 4.30 million last year
and is expected to reach five million this year.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry earned 5.22 billion U.S. dollars for
Indonesia in 1995 and the gross output from all tourism related
transactions reached 3.7 trillion U.S. dollars, exceeding the oil
and gas, automotive, electronic or agriculture sectors.
</P>
<P>
The government has set a target of attracting 6.5 million
foreign tourists in 1998 with a revenue of 8.9 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Back in the early days of the New Order government (the 1960s),
foreign tourist arrivals totaled a mere 86,100, and foreign
exchange earnings an even more slender 10.8 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's tourism industry has grown steadily in recent
years thanks to the government's efforts to catch up with the
tourist boom in the world.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has not only created more jobs but also promoted
development of other industries including hotel,
telecommunications, infrastructure, as well as garment and
handicraft.
</P>
<P>
The government is happy to see that tourism has helped reduce
poverty and the income gap in the country. The increased revenues
from tourism are also playing a greater part in narrowing the
country's trade deficit, which reached almost 6.9 billion U.S.
dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government's investment in tourism has been expanding with
the amounts reaching 48.73 billion rupiah (21.2 million U.S.
dollars) in the 1994-95 fiscal year and 51.8 billion rupiah (22.5
million U.S. dollars) in 1996-97, according to the latest
statistics. Private firms are also encouraged to invest in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
Stepping up its promotion efforts abroad, the National Tourism
Promotion Board (BPPI) has increased the number of its overseas
offices to seven now from four in 1990. It is expected to rise to
12 in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The BPPI has allocated some 22 million U.S. dollars in the
1996-97 fiscal year for promotion campaigns, a 10 percent increase
over the previous year's budget.
</P>
<P>
Under a presidential decree issued in 1983, the Indonesian
government has provided visa-free visits to foreign tourists from
46 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to improve service and the utilization of human
resources in the tourism sector, the government and the private
firms have set up 39 educational and vocational training centers
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The country has also made efforts to develop
environment-friendly green tourism or natural tourism, such as
marine tourism and tours to forests.
</P>
<P>
Measures have been taken to speed up the construction of
facilities and infrastructure such as bridges and hotels, and to
open new tourist resorts.
</P>
<P>
The trends in Indonesia, a tropical archipelago consisting of
more than 17,000 big and small islands with a population of 195
million, show that marine tourism is becoming more and more
flourishing. Indonesian waters, after the Caribbean and the
Mediterranean, may become another marine tourism area of the
world.
</P>
<P>
A WTO official has praised Indonesia's efforts in the
conservation of its national cultures and the environment. "I
assume that you will agree with me, that the government policies
in tourism development and all the efforts being done by the
private sectors are on the right track," said Antonio Enriquez.

QUITO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing 707 cargo plane crashed
shortly after takeoff Tuesday night in the downtown section of an
Ecuadoran port, killing the crew of four and at least 20 others on
the ground, according to local radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the plane struck the bell tower of the La
Dolorosa church and broke up in flames, setting fire to
surrounding houses in Manta, about 250 kilometers southwest of
Quito on the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
A correspondent on the scene for Radio Quito said 20 bodies
were in the town morgue, burned to death following the 10:40
p.m. (local time) crash. It was feared the toll could go higher
because the homes in the area of the crash are tightly grouped and
made of flimsy material.
</P>
<P>
The last major crash in Ecuador was May 4, 1995, when a private
jet went down in the Andes Mountains near Quito, killing all eight
aboard.

In Ecuador's worst recent crash, a DC-8 cargo plane crashed in
Quito on Sept. 22, 1984, killing 75 people.

<HEADLINE> Turki Summit Calls for Closer Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TASHKENT, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of Uzbekistan,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Turkey adopted
here Monday the "Tashkent Declaration", calling for closer
economic and cultural cooperation between the six Turki-speaking
nations.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, which was passed at the Fourth Summit Meeting
of Turki Nations, called on the six nations to strive to create
conditions for a unified commodity, capital and labor market.
</P>
<P>
It said that there are bright prospects for cooperation between
the countries in communication, transportation,
telecommunications, oil and natural gas exploitation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, as the previous ones, stuck to "the principle of
non-politicization" by not mentioning in any single word the
situation in Afghanistan bordering central Asia.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding difference between the current meeting and the
previous three ones is that the declaration for the first time
since October 1992 put forward the concept of "Turki Organization"
and planned to "establish the secretariat for the summit meeting
of Turki-speaking nations."
</P>
<P>
The First Summit Meeting of Turki Nations was held in Ankara,
capital of Turkey, in October 1992 at the initiation of then
President of Turkey Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the five countries of the former Soviet republics
expressed their satisfaction with their cooperation in science,
culture and education.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say promotion of cooperation with Turkey is conducive
to the diversification of foreign exchanges of the former Soviet
countries and the restoration of their ethnic traditions and thus,
tiding over as soon as possible the economic crises plaguing the
countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the five countries are geographically close to each
other and share common historical, cultural and religious
origins.

<P>
SINGAPORE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
of Singapore has been named the Architect of the New Century this
year by the American think-tank the Nixon Center for Peace and
Freedom, the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is the second such award given out by the center, formed
in 1994 by former U.S. president Richard Nixon. The first one went
to Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich last
year.
</P>
<P>
This year's award, in the form of a crystal star, will be
conferred on Lee at a black-tie dinner on November 11 at the Four
Seasons Hotel in Washington D.C., the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Dimitri Simes, president of the Nixon
Center, said Lee is not only a great leader, but also a great man,
who is a controversial figure with his share of critics. He is the
only living person described as a "great leader" in Nixon's book
Leaders.
</P>
<P>
The citation from the center for Lee's achievements reads: "Lee
Kuan Yew, Senior Minister and former Prime Minister of Singapore
is -- as President Richard Nixon observed - a man of 'true
greatness' whose impact is felt far beyond his country and his
region."
</P>
<P>
"Lee Kuan Yew's courage, vision and ingenuity in building the
foundations of our new world make him a true Architect of the New
Century," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Nixon Center, which is an independent division of the
Richard Nixon Library &AMP; Birth-Place Foundation, focuses on the
analysis of policy changes around the world and their accompanying
impact on U.S. national interest.

<HEADLINE> Retail Prices In China Hit Four-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Retail prices in China were up
6.6 percent during the first nine months of this year, the lowest
rise in four years, the State Statistical Bureau reports.
</P>
<P>
The economy retained its steady growth in the January-September
period, rising by 9.6 percent from same period of last year,
indicating "substantial improvement" in China's inflation since
1992, and signifying a turnaround for the embarrassing situation
of high economic growth mixed with a high inflation rate,
according to Qiu Xiaohua, the bureau's chief economist, in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Retail prices had gone wild since 1992, with a spiralling 21.7
percent in 1994, but statistics now show that retail prices rose
by only 5 percent in September this year, the lowest since 1992.
</P>
<P>
"This is very good news. It would not have been possible
without the hard-won macro-economic stabilization program launched
in mid-1993," Pieter Bottelier, chief representative of the World
Bank Resident Mission in China, noted in a telephone interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The falling retail prices are also the result of consecutive
good harvests in the past several years, Qiu explains. China's
grain output is estimated to be up more than 10 billion kilograms
this year, over last year.
</P>
<P>
With the inflation rate coming down to single-digit figures,
Qiu added, China's economy, which is now close to double-digit
growth, has entered a new phase of moderate and orderly growth.

DHAKA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The movable property of some
retired army officers, "self-confessed killers" of Bangladeshi
"father of nation" Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman has been
seized.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources here today, the retired army

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on Stationing Troops in Hong Kong Goes to Legislature  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The draft of a law concerning
stationing troops to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HK SAR) of the People's Republic of China was submitted to the
country's top legislative body today.
</P>
<P>
Sending the People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops to Hong Kong
on July 1, 1997 has become a matter of concern among Hong Kong
residents. The draft law states that criminal and civil cases
involving officers and men stationed there are to be handled by
military or local courts, depending on whether they involve
official duties.
</P>
<P>
Fu Quanyou, a member of the Central Military Commission (CMC)
and chief of the general staff of the PLA, explained the draft to
the 22nd session of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, which opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
"The stipulations were based on the Basic Law of the HK SAR,
and with reference to British Army practices in Hong Kong," Fu
said.
</P>
<P>
The draft Law notes that "criminal cases involving troops
stationed in Hong Kong will be handled by the military judiciary,
but that crimes committed by off-duty personnel, in which the
person or the property of both Hong Kong residents and others,
with the exception of the stationed military personnel, are
infringed upon, will be handled by the courts of the HK SAR."
</P>
<P>
Cases in which soldiers violate the civil rights of Hong Kong
residents of other persons, except for military personnel, will be
dealt with by courts of the HK SAR, but when the violations
involve on-duty personnel, the cases are to be handled by the
Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The draft law states that PLA troops' defense and other
operations in Hong Kong are not subject to courts of the HK SAR.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Denounces Russia's Claims Over Crimean Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine today sharply criticized
Russian officials who claimed the Ukrainian city of Sevastopol,
the headquarters of the disputed Black Sea Fleet, was part of
Russian territory.
</P>
<P>
Yury Sergeyev, director of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry press
bureau, also attacked attempts by the Russian State Duma, the
lower house of parliament, to stop the five-year process of
splitting the Fleet between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Ukraine would not recognize any bill passed by the Duma
over the sovereignty of Sevastopol, a strategic port on the
southern tip of the Crimean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev was responding to controversial remarks made by Moscow
city Mayor Yuri Luzhkov in an open letter to Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernormyrdin and the State
Duma.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov said Sevastopol had never been part of the surrounding
Crimean regional that was granted to Ukraine by the Soviet Union
in the 1950s. He said Sevastopol had always been and always would
be a Russian city.
</P>
<P>
Sacked Russian Security Council secretary Alexander Lebed had
already made similar claims about the port's status.
</P>
<P>
But Sergeyev said that attempts to change the border between
the two countries were very dangerous and violated the rules of
international law.
</P>
<P>
According to the decree issued by the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet in the former Soviet Union in 1954, he said, the state of
Crimea had ceded to Ukraine, and the clause was fixed in the
constitutions of the republics of Ukraine and Russia in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Russia's parliament first brought up the question of
Sevastopol's status in 1993, Sergeyev said, but a United Nations
Security Council resolution in July reaffirmed Ukraine's
sovereignty over the city.
</P>
<P>
The Duma is now debating a bill opposing a deal reached between
Russia and Ukraine to split the Black Sea Fleet belonging to the
former Soviet Union. Negotiations over the division of the fleet
have been going on for several years but have been dogged by
disputes between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma will meet his counterpart
Yelstin in Moscow tomorrow to discuss the issue which has become a
major obstacle preventing the two countries from signing a
friendship treaty.

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on Soldiers Stationed in HK SAR Goes to Legislature (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to a proposal signed by Premier Li Peng and the
chairman of the CMC, Jiang Zemin, on submitting the draft law to
the legislature, the law "is aimed at ensuring that the troops to
be stationed by the central people's government in the Hong Kong
SAR for defense matters, will carry out their duties in accordance
with the law, safeguarding the country's sovereignty,
re-unification, and territorial integrity, and the security of
Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
With regard to relations between the stationed troops and the
HK SAR government, the draft states that "troops stationed in Hong
Kong will not interfere in the SAR's local affairs," and that
"troops stationed in Hong Kong will notify the HK SAR government
in advance of any military drills and exercises to be conducted
that involve the public interest in the SAR."
</P>
<P>
The draft states that "the HK SAR government should provide the
necessary facilities for the troops in carrying out their defense
duties, and should safeguard the legal interests of the stationed
troops and military personnel," and that "the SAR should solicite
opinions from the military personnel when working on policies and
bills that concern them."
</P>
<P>
The draft law sets forth strict disciplines for the stationed
troops. They are not allowed to get involved with Hong Kong's
political and religious organizations and social institutions, and
are not allowed to engage in profit-making businesses or other
activities that are incompatible with military personnel.
</P>
<P>
The draft law also says "military personnel in Hong Kong who
violate the laws of the state and the HK SAR will be prosecuted in
accordance with the law," and that "military personnel in Hong
Kong who violate military disciplinary rules will be given
disciplinary punishment."
</P>
<P>
The draft law consists of 29 articles in six chapters,
detailing the duties and defense responsibilities of the stationed
troops and their role in local public security and disaster relief
operations.
</P>
<P>
After being adopted by top legislature, the law will go into
effect on July 1, 1997, the very date on which China resumes the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the Chinese PLA troops
are garrisoned there.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Take 1 Percent of IMF Credit Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has agreed to
contribute a minimum of one percent to a new International
Monetary Fund (IMF) credit facility, Thai Central Bank Governor
Rernchai Marakanond said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is expected to contribute around 340 million special
drawing rights (SDRs) (476 million US dollars) of the total 34
billion SDRs (48.96 billion dollars) in the new IMF credit
facility called the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), Rernchai
said.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand would soon submit the proposal to the
Cabinet for approval before making an official commitment with the
IMF, he was quoted as saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Upon receiving Cabinet approval, the bank will put its
contribution in place from Thailand's official foreign reserves,
which posted 39.4 billion dollars in August this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The new IMF credit facility will enable Thailand to have an
additional channel for borrowing when the country faces a
financial crisis, Rernchai said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank governor also said that Malaysia and
Singapore also have agreed to contribute at least one percent of
the NAB credit line each.
</P>
<P>
The NAB is founded by the Group of 10 to expand the IMF's
emergency funding sources in the wake of Mexico's crisis in
December 1994.
</P>
<P>
So far, the G-10 has invited 14 countries with high foreign
exchange reserves to take 20 percent of the NAB fund, including
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Denmark,
Austria, South Korea, Chile, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia.

<P>
KIEV, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Russia could
eventually settle their Black Sea Fleet issue in early November, a
Ukrainian official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fleet issue has never been as close to a settlement as
today, said Vladimir Gorbulin, Secretary of the National Security
and Defense Council of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
He said agreements could be expected during November 5-10.
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin made the remarks when commenting on a meeting Tuesday
between Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and the Ukrainian and
Russian negotiators on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said negotiations that began Tuesday will mainly be focused
on the status and conditions for the stationing of the Russian
Black Sea Fleet in Ukraine, the division of the former Soviet
Union's Black Sea Fleet as well as accounts settlement for the
leasing.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have reached or almost reached agreement on the
first two issues, Gorbulin added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Russian State Duma's adoption of a bill
opposing the division of the fleet, Gorbulin said Duma's decision
could lead to serious conflicts with the government and the
president and would not do good to national stability, the
Ukrainian news agency UNIAN reported.
</P>
<P>
He said he could not rule out that Ukrainian parliament would
pass relevant decisions.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian parliament said on October 18 that the country would
modify its constitution on the pullout of foreign troops, if

<HEADLINE> U.S., DPRK Officials May Meet in U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
said today that U.S. diplomats might meet at the United Nations a
senior official from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) and discuss some of their differences.
</P>
<P>
"We have made a decision that we are going to keep talking to
the North Koreans, ...because we believe that by continuing to
meet them, we might be able to make progress on some of these
issues," said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
Burns was referring to the DPRK's submarine stranded off the
South Korean coast on what the DPRK said a routine mission; the
incarceration of an American citizen, Carl Hunziker, who illegally
entered into the DPRK's territory; and DPRK's possible ballistic
missile test.
</P>
<P>
Washington has either stood by South Korea on the first event,
or expressed its opposition on the other two issues.
</P>
<P>
Li Hyong Chol, director of American affairs of DPRK's Foreign
Ministry, is due in New York later this week on U.N. business.
</P>
<P>
"Since he is in town it may be possible he will join one of the
regular meetings the State Department conducts with North Korea in
New York," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that preparations were underway for a
meeting later this week between Li Hyong Chol and a delegation
from the State Department.
</P>
<P>
The United States has no formal diplomatic ties with the DPRK,
but both sides often hold talks in New York through the two
countries' missions to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"That's where we get a lot of our business done," Burns said.

<HEADLINE> First Argentine-Built Satellite to be Put Into Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Argentina will put a
181-kilogram satellite, the first built in the country, into orbit
on October 29, officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
However, the SAC-B satellite, designed for scientific
applications in solar, terrestrial-solar physics and astrophysics,
will start the three-year journey from a U.S. base.
</P>
<P>
It was built by Argentina's National Commission of Space
Activities (CONAE) with help from the U.S. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration and space agencies of Italy and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the SAC-B satellite will be sent into
orbit from Wallops, 300 kilometers south of Washington D.C., and
its launch will be televised live back to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The project was contained in a framework agreement for peaceful
use of ultraterrestrial space, signed in 1991 by Argentine
President Carlos Menem and the then U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
A CONAE report said SAC-B was one of the first concrete
achievements of Argentina's 1995-2006 National Space Program.
</P>
<P>
After the launch of SAC-B, the country will continue with other
undertakings including the exploitation of natural resources, the
control and protection of ecosystems, CONAE said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Party Embroiled in Internal Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The two feuding factions in the
Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (Laban) have stepped up their
effort to force each other out of the badly decimated biggest
opposition force in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing purge inside the party would continue until the
faction headed by Representative Jose Cojuangco Jr. and party
secretary Hernani Perez leave the party, the Philippine daily
Inquirer today quoted a member of the group led by party chair
Edgardo Angara as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are still waiting for the departure of Cojuangco and his
group," Senator Ernesto Herrera, a key Angara ally, said. "After
that, the natural, voluntary cleansing will be over. We hope they
will resign."
</P>
<P>
The paper said mass defections and resignations have hit the
Laban since the October 10 Senate reshuffle which brought the
Angara-Cojuangco feud into the open. Unseated Senate President
Neptali Gonzales and more than 10,000 members including some local
officials left the party after the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 17 disgruntled members even joined the
ruling Lakas-NUCD or other parties, while the rest chose to be
independent pending the outcome of the party rift.
</P>
<P>
Herrera, however, said the defections and resignations were
part of the process to weed out those "who have been working with
other parties." He added that the party renegades are trying to
gain the confidence of the ruling party by wreaking havoc in the
Laban party and after weakening the Laban, they would formally
defect to the ruling Lakas-NUCD.
</P>
<P>
But the rival group accused Angara of betraying the interests
of the party by installing a non-Laban Senate president and warned
in the meantime that it would continue to use the Laban name,
whether or not they formally break up with Angara's group.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Votes in Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
was out seeking votes in Florida today, one of the few large
states where the race between him and Republican presidential
nominee Bob Dole remains tight.
</P>
<P>
Statewide polls have shown Clinton holding a lead of around 5
percentage points over Dole in Florida, just a fraction of his
double-digit lead in most nationwide surveys.
</P>
<P>
While the Dole campaign has pulled back its activities in some
large states where Clinton holds overwhelming leads, both sides
are fiercely contesting Florida.
</P>
<P>
Beginning a 23-hour visit, Clinton addressed some 12,000 people
who packed an outdoor rally at Miami-Dade Community College.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's team, having lost Florida's 25 electoral votes to
former President George Bush by less than 2 percentage points in
1992, believe the pressure this year rests fully on Dole.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, nearing the end of his current four-day, five-state
trip, arrived from Michigan, where he had also spent about 23
hours, although he holds a large statewide lead approaching 20
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, he took time Tuesday from his regular campaign
speeches to deliver an address on foreign policy highlighted by
his call for accepting new NATO members from Eastern and Central
Europe by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Dole, also campaigning in Michigan Tuesday, criticized the 1999
proposal, saying he preferred 1998 and declared there was no more
time for "foot-dragging" on NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was due to return Wednesday to Washington, but will
head out immediately the next day for stops in Alabama, Louisiana,
Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee and Missouri as the initial part of
an anticipated full schedule of campaigning through to election
day on November 5.

<HEADLINE> China Striving to Use Wind Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China has purchased wind-power
generators with the capability of generating 73,000 kilowatts of
power from Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed between China Nam Kwong National Import
and Export Corporation and Micon and Vestas companies of Denmark
yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The step is part of the Ministry of Power Industry's plan to
build 120,000-kilowatt wind-power generating facilities. The cost
is estimated at 1.2 billion yuan, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The new equipment will be installed in Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that wind resources in China may represent 253
million kilowatts of power.
</P>
<P>
The wind-power industry started in the 1950s in China. At the
beginning, the industry was dominated by small wind-power
generators.
</P>
<P>
About 140,000 small and medium-sized windmills and large wind
turbines churn out electricity in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang
autonomous regions, Guangdong and Liaoning provinces, and some
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
In Inner Mongolia, there are about 100,000 small wind-power
generating units capable of producing 1.2 billion kilowatt hours
of electricity a year.

<HEADLINE> China to Work Out Rules for Monitoring BOT Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China will soon have a set of
regulations governing the management of Build-Operate-Transfer
(BOT) foreign-invested projects, "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted She Jianmin, vice-minister of the State
Planning Commission, as saying that a draft of the regulations has
been submitted to the State Council for approval.
</P>
<P>
BOT has become a popular financing alternative adopted in many
developing countries that use foreign investment for
infrastructural construction.
</P>
<P>
Under this practice, the government usually grants a concession
for full investment, design, construction, procurements, operation
and maintenance of a project. The project company is to transfer
the project to the government unconditionally upon the expiration
of the concession period.
</P>
<P>
China is still cautious regarding BOT projects. It has so far
approved only two power projects to use foreign investment under
BOT.
</P>
<P>
The first one, which was approved one and a half years ago, is
located inside Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and the other
one, approved in this August, is located in central China's Hunan
Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou Bohua, vice-governor of Hunan Province,
preparations for open international bidding for the Hunan Changsha
Power Plant have proceeding smoothly and a draft agreement with
the selected foreign company will be signed before the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
The plant, located 25 kilometers from Changsha, capital of
Hunan Province, is expected to have two 350,000 kw coal-burning
generators. When completed, the project will have a total
generating capacity of 1.4 million kw.
</P>
<P>
She Jianmin said the projects in Guangxi and Hunan are under
strict guidance from his commission and the Ministry of Power
Industry.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission is offering some of its
staff-training on BOT operation and international procedures.
</P>
<P>
The experiment will go beyond the power sector to the
construction of high-grade highways, tunnels, bridges, water
plants and hydraulic power plants, the vice-minister added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian Foreign Minister
Vladimir Senko said here today that NATO should respect the
security of other countries in its eastern expansion drive.
</P>
<P>
The visiting foreign minister, speaking after talks with his
Portuguese counterpart, Jaime Gama, said today's NATO is a far cry
from what it was during the Cold War and that its eastern
enlargement should be strictly guided by the principle of not
undermining the security of its members and that of other
countries as well.
</P>
<P>
Senko, who arrived in Lisbon today on a two-day visit,
reiterated that Belarus would continue to remain neutral and not
participate in any military alliances.
</P>
<P>
He expected the issue of European security to be fully and
seriously discussed at the conference of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) due to open here in
December. The OSCE provides a multilateral forum for dialogue and
negotiation among its 53 member states.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Warsaw
Pact bloc of east European countries in 1991, NATO, the western
military alliance, has announced plans to expand to take in the
former republics of the Soviet Union. But Russia, which has
maintained close ties with Belarus since its independence, has
strongly opposed the move.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Local Elections Postponed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, Oct 22 (Xinhua) - Municipal elections in Bosnia have
been postponed again until early next year, the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Robert Frowick, the head of the OSCE mission which is in charge
of elections in Bosnia, told a press conference here that the
elections would hopefully be held next spring.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement, which was signed last
December ending the three-and-half-year war in Bosnia, local
elections should have been held on September 14.
</P>
<P>
But due to voter registration irregularities, it was initially
put off until November 23 and 24, dates insisted on by the Clinton
administration, which feared that a long delay in the municipal
elections would affect the withdrawal of American troops from
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
But European officials warned that the local elections would be
disastrous if held in November, because of unresolved problems of
voter registration and the lack of experienced officials to run
the elections.
</P>
<P>
Almost all senior officials of the OSCE mission resigned after
the national elections on September 14 following criticisms over
the lack of proper supervision.

But he dropped his action after negotiations with Falk, who
agreed to carry an apology in today's issue of his newspaper
rescinding the report and donate 1 million shillings (100,000
U.S. dollars) to charity.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM to Settle Dispute With Duma Over Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin met with leaders of major State Duma factions Tuesday
to try to settle the dispute over the draft budget for 1997,
according to TV reports.
</P>
<P>
The reports believe that the "working meeting" may help reach a
compromise between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Duma (Lower House of Parliament) deputies
rejected the government-proposed draft during the first hearing,
describing it as "unrealistic."
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting involved leaders Gennady Zyuganov of the
Communist faction, Grigory Yavlinsky of the Yabloko faction and
Nikolai Ryzhkov of the Popular Rule faction, as well as
representatives from a number of other Duma factions or groups.
</P>
<P>
Such contacts are "a good process which allows agreement
between representatives of different branches of power in the
country and different political forces without some special
procedures," "Our Home Is Russia" faction leader Sergei Belyayev
said.
</P>
<P>
So far there have been no reports of what the meeting has
achieved.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Chernomyrdin chaired the first session of the
president's temporary commission for tightening tax and budget
discipline, saying that the Kremlin would not renounce its
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, aiming to discuss priority measures on collection
of taxes and other obligatory payments, ended with a decision to
bring an action for bankruptcy of four debtors, or enterprises, to
the Court of Arbitration.

<HEADLINE> Long-Airdox Expands Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- US-based mining machinery group
Long-Airdox is posed to expand its investment in China with the
opening of two newly funded companies, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The 3.5 million US dollar Long-Airdox (Tianjin) and 5 million
US dollar Tangshan TYL LTD are respectively 100 percent and 65
percent owned by Long-Airdox.
</P>
<P>
The two companies are the first foreign-funded ventures in the
coal-mining machinery industry, according to Long-Airdox officials.
</P>
<P>
The annual production capacity of the two companies is expected
to reach over one million conveyor idlers each year within three
years, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The solely owned Long-Airdox (Tianjin) Ltd., located in the
Tianjin Xiqing Economic Development Zone, will initially
manufacture Long-Airdox conveyor idlers.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin company is able to produce system-drive power
requirements, lower power consumption and cut operating costs. It
will also offer bulk-material handling solutions using technology
from the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the manufacturing plant is a bonded warehouse in
the Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone which will hold a stock of
replacement parts for Long-Airdox products.
</P>
<P>
Chris Gradel, director of Long-Airdox China Operations, said
Long-Airdox regards Tianjin as its future manufacturing center for
the Asia-Pacific market.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan TYL Ltd, in north China's Hebei Province, is a joint
venture between Long-Airdox and Tangshan Mining and Metallurgical
Machinery Plant aimed at manufacturing conveyor idlers.

<HEADLINE> Counting of Votes Suspended in Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua' Supreme Electoral
Council (CSE) has ordered a suspension of the counting of votes
for Sunday's general elections, said electoral officials today.
</P>
<P>
The CSE, which had finished the counting of 62.58 percent of
votes, didn't give a reason for delaying the official announcement
of final results initially expected for later today.
</P>
<P>
So far, Arnoldo Aleman, the Liberal Alliance presidential
candidate and a former Managua mayor, has maintained a 10 percent
advantage over Daniel Ortega, of the Sandinista National
Liberation Front (FSLN).
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Alliance has received 574,704 votes, or 48.7
percent of the total; while the FSLN has pocketed 458,860 votes,
or 39.71 percent, the Christian Path Party 49,227 votes, 4.17
percent, and Conservative Party 28,684 votes, 2.43 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the FSLN has denounced a series of "serious irregularities"
in the vote and demanded a full-scale revision of the results.
</P>
<P>
"We have asked for a recount, in accordance with the law," said
FSLN campaign manager Alvaro Fiallos.
</P>
<P>
Ortega, the former president, alleged Monday that telegrams
used to report provincial results to the CSE were "altered" and
did not reflect the number of votes his party obtained.
</P>
<P>
He said the 60,000 votes received by the FSLN did not appear on
the tallies sent by different polling stations in the country,
especially in the central department of Matagalpa.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, one of the international
observers monitoring the elections, said at a press conference
today that the FSLN's objections are based on the electoral laws
and asked the CSE to comply with their petitions.
</P>
<P>
Electoral scrutinizers from the Liberal Alliance and the FSLN
today began a revision of the telegrams reporting ballot counts
from Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
Both parties said that they have no way of comparing the CSE
results with the official reports from each polling station of the
votes signed by their respective scrutinizers, said Carter.
</P>
<P>
And the Christian Path Party is in the same situation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Carter met late on Monday with Aleman, Ortega, CSE President
Rosa Marina Zelaya and outgoing President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro.
</P>
<P>
Carter said the CSE had promised to provide copies of the
telegrams to those political parties to enable them to
double-check the results.
</P>
<P>
But the revision of the count will not affect the counting
process being carried out by the CSE, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that that discrepancy will be major and if any
is found it will be corrected," said Carter, who held that the
Nicaraguan electoral process was "free and fair."
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most complicated elections I have ever
witnessed, with nearly 9,000 polling stations, 24 parties and six
parallel elections," said the former U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
Under Nicaragua's electoral law, the candidates who receives
more than 45 percent of the votes can be declared the winner but a
second round of voting must be held if none of the candidates
passed the 45 percent mark.

<HEADLINE> China Closes 50,000 Severely Polluting Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China has shut down almost
50,000 severely polluting enterprises since the State Council
issued an environmental protection order in August.
</P>
<P>
The doors have slammed on the factories under the country's
"Regulations Concerning Certain Issues about Environmental
Protection".
</P>
<P>
An official from the State Bureau for Environmental Protection
noted that most of the closed enterprises are engaged in gold
mining, coking, tanning, paper making, oil refining, electric
coating, lead and zinc mining, and sulphur extraction. About 92
percent of the listed paper mills have been shut down or have
suspended production, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics from the State Bureau for
Environmental Protection, 71 percent of the 70,024 enterprises
have now been shut down. The majority of them are township
enterprises, and the workers are mostly local farmers and
transient laborers.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the enterprises has had no serious impact on
local economies, and has safeguarded local stablization, an
official said.
</P>
<P>
The State Council issued its first regulations concerning
environmental protection for township and street committee-run
enterprises in 1984, which banned the development of severely
polluting industries.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the regulations to have the expected effect was
blamed on weak law enforcement and the lack of environment
awareness among some local officials, the official said.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 environmental law enforcement personnel
throughout the country have been sent to the 'ecological front
line' to supervise the closure program, the official said.

Maradona were at the house with two women three nights before the
police raid.

He hinted that the women had planted the cocaine, the reports

The reports quoted Bernasconi as saying that Maradona would be
called to testify, "but for the time being his testimony is not
that relevant."

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, October 22 (Xinhua) - The three members of Bosnian
presidency met for the first formal session on Tuesday in a
downtown Sarajevo museum with a pledge to make the country's joint
institutions work.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Alija Izetbegovic, who is a Muslim and the
chairman of the presidency, Croat representative Kresimir Zubak
and Momcilo Krajisnik of the Serb side signed a joint statement on
the future functioning of the Presidency.
</P>
<P>
This statement seems to be a concession to Krajisnik who in
return signed an oath pledging to uphold the Bosnian constitution
which had already been signed by the other two members.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement said that the work of joint institutions
would be based on principles of equality between the Muslim-Croat
federation and the Serb republic as well as among the three
constitutional peoples in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The three presidential members also agreed on a temporary
arrangement, under which they will hold their meetings in the
National Museum in Sarajevo, which is in the federation side, and
at the Electrical engineering Faculty in Lukavica, which is in the
Serb territory.
</P>
<P>
The formal session was held in the presence of the
international community's High Representative Carl Bildt and U.S.
assistant state secretary John Kornblum who came here to pressure
the three sides to find a compromise after a dispute on the venue
stalled the functioning of the presidency.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Says 20,800 U.S. Troops May Exposed to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
is notifying 20,800 U.S. Gulf War veterans that they may have been
exposed to nerve gas during the destruction of an Iraqi chemical
weapons depot in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon in announcing the move today said that hundreds
more nerve gas rockets may have been exploded than first thought
and expanded the time frame when exposure may have occurred.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said before that they were concerned about
two explosions in southern Iraq on March 4 and March 10, 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon was sending letters to the 20,800 U.S. Gulf War
veterans now, telling them the period of possible exposure as
March 4 to March 15 of that year, and asking them to register with
the Pentagon or the Veterans Administration if they need medical
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The time frame was expanded because of conflicting accounts of
the number of rockets potentially destroyed and the dates on which
demolitions took place, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon says that up to two tons of sarin nerve gas may
have been released when Iraqi rocket shells were demolished at two
sites.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon first said only about 300 to 400 Army engineers
may have been exposed to the chemical weapons, but later added the
figure to 15,000 and said it could go higher.

<HEADLINE> Britain on Bomb Alert Before Christmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22, (Xinhua) -- Security chiefs warned today
that Britain would face "dangerous months" in which Irish
guerrillas could mount major attacks on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
David Veness, assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan
Police, told ITN television that the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
guerrillas could be planning a spectacular strike before
Christmas, possibly in revenge for the killing by police last
month of one of their activists.
</P>
<P>
The IRA broke a 17-month truce in February with a series of
bombings in Britain, including a blast in the northern city of
Manchester which injured 200 people.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the IRA planted a bomb inside British army
headquarters in Northern Ireland, killing one soldier and injuring
30 others.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's chief police officer Huge Annesley warned
that IRA guerrillas would attempt further bomb attacks before
laying down their arms again.
</P>
<P>
London's Scotland Yard police headquarters urged Britons to be
alert and encouraged people to call its anti-terrorist hotline to
report any suspicions.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council today passed a presidential statement which shows concern
for the conflict in Georgia and voices the U.N. support for an
earlier political settlement of the conflicts in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council notes with deep concern that no
significant progress has yet been achieved towards a comprehensive
political settlement of the conflict, including on the political
status of Abkhazia, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The settlement should also include the respect for the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its
internationally recognized borders, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reaffirmed its full support for an active
role of the United Nations, with the assistance of the Russian
Federal as facilitator, aimed at achieving a comprehensive
political settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council stresses that the primary responsibility
for achieving peace rests upon the parties themselves and calls on
them to resume discussions and to reach substantive progress in
the negotiations, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Council also calls on both parties to take all the
necessary steps to stop any threats against peace-keeping forces
in the region, such as mine-laying.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council remains deeply concerned at the
continued obstruction of the return of the refugees and
displaced persons by the Abkhaz authorities, which is "totally
unacceptable", it said.

UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese representative
said at the United Nations today that China has enhanced
cooperation with international forces in cracking down various
forms of organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to further enhance cooperation with other
countries in a practical and effective manner, in a joint effort
to curb the mounting threat of organized transnational crime," Li
Sangu, a member from the Chinese delegation to the U.N., said at a
session of the Third Committee (on Social Development) of the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
While introducing China's stand on the world efforts in crime
prevention, Li called for the attention to the increase of
organized transnational crime which include money laundering,
corruption and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
She said judicial and technical cooperation and exchanges among
different countries have become more important than ever. And it
is also essential to enhance the capability of developing
countries to prevent and control crime.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese representative called on the United Nations and
international community to provide more financial resources and
technical assistance to developing countries in their efforts to
combat criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
Again, Li stressed the respect for state sovereignty while
carrying out international cooperation. "The contents and forms
of such cooperation should meet the actual needs of developing
countries," she said.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Meets Bhutto's Envoy over Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today met with a special envoy from Pakistan and said
that there is no military solution to the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president reiterated once again that
establishment of peace in Afghanistan could only materialize
through peaceful talks among all Afghan factions and ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president made the statement while meeting Zafar
Helali, the Pakistani special envoy sent by Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani also expressed his deep regret over the Afghan
crisis which is only raising the life and material losses for
that country.
</P>
<P>
However, he voiced Iran's readiness to help find a solution
to the Afghan problem in order to stop the bloodletting and
fratricide.
</P>
<P>
Zafar Helali arrived here Monday carrying a message from
Benazir Bhutto for President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in a bid
to iron out difference on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's official news agency IRNA, Prime Minister
Bhutto in a message called for Iran's active cooperation in
efforts aimed at putting an end to the crisis in neighboring
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
She emphasized the willingness of her government for further
consolidation of ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Helali told the Iranian president that Pakistan does not
support any Afghan group and is ready to contribute to any
proposal put forward by Iran to end the current crisis in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Terming Iran as the "best friend" of the Pakistani government
and people, he stated that no factor whatsoever could disturb
the sincere friendship and cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here noted that the seizure of the Kabul
by the Taliban has strained the relations between Tehran and
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the Tehran government lost a political game to its
neighbor of Pakistan, which got high points in backing the
Taliban group to oust former Afghan president Buhanuddin
Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Iran maintains that the Taliban has flourished as a result of
U.S. planning, Saudi financial support and Pakistan's logistical
backing.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
criticized Pakistan for its support to the militant Taliban,
saying "outside interference will complicate the Afghan crisis."
</P>
<P>
Velayati told Zafar Helali that no single faction in
Afghanistan is capable of forming an absolute government in the
country by keeping out other groups from the political scene.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source said that Iranian army has started
extensive maneuvers in the Torbat-Jam area near border with
Afghanistan in a bid to put political and military pressure upon
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the armored, airborne, infantry and
mechanized divisions are taking part in the maneuvers
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the maneuvers would send a strong
signal to the militant Taliban. The war games are held in an
area inside Iranian territory which is only an hour's drive to
Herat city held by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian military move shows that the Tehran government
would continue its support to the ousted Rabbani
government.

DAMASCUS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian Council of
Minister hailed the visit by French President Jacques Chirac to
Syria as positive and important, an official Syrian source
said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, at today's meeting, the cabinet
reviewed the political situation, focusing on Chirac's visit to
the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud
Zouebi said the outcome of the French president's visit to Syria
was "outstanding and successful."

Zouebi said that talks between President Chirac and Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad had been held in an atmosphere of
friendship and strong desire to deepen and expand cooperation
between France and Syria in political, economic, trade,
scientific, technical and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara said the French
president's visit to the country was characterized by what he
termed as daring and just political stances with regard to the

<HEADLINE> China Urges Developed Countries to Act on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China urged today
developed countries to take actual steps to improve international
cooperation in environment protection.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Wang Xuexian, China's Deputy Permanent
Representative to the U.N., at a meeting on the special session
for an overall review and appraisal of the Implementation of
Agenda 21 to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
The Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio,
Brazil in 1992, adopted the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21, which
have embodied the ideas of international development cooperation,
in environment in particular.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador said at today's meeting that the
progress made in international cooperation in the field of
environment and development in the past few years falls far behind
the objectives set at the conference as well as behind general
expectation.
</P>
<P>
"The commitments made by developed countries in terms of
financial resources and technology transfer remain, to a large
extent, words on paper," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is also a growing trend of making developing countries
undertake obligations beyond their actual capacity, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador reiterated the principles set forth at
the Conference, such as "coordination between environmental
protection and economic development", "common but differentiated
responsibilities" and "taking into consideration the special
conditions of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He also called the world's attention to the cooperation,
particularly in terms of financial resources and technology
transfer.
</P>
<P>
As a major developing country, Wang said, China pays great
importance to environment. It has shut down thousands of pollutant
factories along the Huaihe River in eastern China and planted more
than 23 billion trees over the past 18 years as part of its
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The country has registered an average annual growth rate of 10
percent in GNP, but it has also avoided a corresponding
deterioration of the environment, he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Proposes to Establish "Moslem Bloc" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Islamist Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan today proposed the creation of an
eight-nation Moslem bloc as an alternative to the Group Seven
(G-7) formed by highly developed states.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan made the initiative at the Conference on Cooperation
and Development which is being held in Turkey's largest city of
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Moslem Eight (M-8) "will not conflict with
Turkey's relations with the European Union (EU) and is not aimed
against any country," Erbakan said at the Ciragan Palace Hotel in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Egypt
and Nigeria would be the member states of the Moslem-8 group,
Turkish sources said.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said in his address, "Cooperation between countries
in the process of development is very important in order to
become stronger partners of the developed countries."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pointed out that peace was very important
for countries in the process of development, stressing that the
necessary conditions for this were: "Dialogue instead of
tension, cooperation instead of exploitation, justice instead of
double standards, peace instead of war, democracy instead of
oligarchy and equal human rights instead of segregation."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan pointed out that Turkey had good relations with the
European countries through the EU and NATO, and with the Russian
Federation, the Islamic world and African countries by way of
organizations such as the Black Sea Economic Organization and
the Economic Cooperation Organization.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that those countries attending the
conference had an important cultural heritage and a strategic
importance due to their geographical position.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite these positive elements, the necessary
economic development had not yet been achieved and the countries
were backward in terms of international trade.
</P>
<P>
"But if we come together and join forces, we will easily
overcome the barriers," he concluded.

LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Eurotunnel, the debt-laden
Anglo-French Channel tunnel operator, confirmed today its plans to
shed almost one-fifth of its 3,500 strong workforce.
</P>
<P>
The company announced that it is axing 657 jobs in a
cost-cutting drive, with 306 jobs going in the UK, including at
its London headquarters and its operational base in Folkestone,
Kent. Another 351 jobs are to go in France.
</P>
<P>
The job cuts are expected to be implemented over the next 12 to
14 months and will largely affect short-term contract workers and
consultants as well as a number of full-time staff.
</P>
<P>
The move, which will save 16 million pounds (25.4 million US
dollars) a year, is part of an extensive clampdown on costs
already announced as the group, which is in talks to restructure
its 9.1 billion pounds (14.5 billion US dollars) bank debt, tries
