<HEADLINE> Arafat to Pay Short Visit to Egypt on Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat will arrive in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria on Tuesday for a short visit, the Palestinian
ambassador in Cairo Zohdi al Qedrah said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Al Qedrah told Egypt's Middle East News Agency that Arafat is
to brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on his meeting Thursday
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak over the final-status talks
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will keep Mubarak informed on the implementation of the
Israeli-Palestinian Sharm el-Sheikh agreement signed early this
month in Egypt, and the latest developments in the final-status
talks, al Qedrah said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel began last Monday negotiations for
a final peace agreement on thorny issues including Jerusalem,
Palestinian statehood, Jewish settlements, refugees and water
resources.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to work out outlines of a final
status agreement by next February and reach a full accord by
September 2000.
</P>
<P>
Al Qedrah hailed Egypt's role in activating the peace process
and Mubarak's keenness on supporting the Palestinians' efforts to
restore their legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Egypt, keeps close contacts and
consultations with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president plays a significant role in mediating
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. Egypt signed a peace accord
with Israel in 1979, becoming the first Arab country to make peace
with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Close West Bank and Gaza for Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army announced
Saturday that it would impose a full closure on the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank for two days as of midnight, one day before the
beginning of the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
"The entry to Israel of Palestinians from Judea and Samaria
and the Gaza Strip will not be permitted except for urgent health
or humanitarian cases," an army statement said.
</P>
<P>
Yom Kippur, or the Day of Atonement, is the holiest and most
important day of the Jewish year. It starts at sunset Sunday and
ends on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The closure was the second in less than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The army sealed off the West Bank and Gaza for three days last
week after Israeli security forces were reportedly informed by
Palestinian security officials of plans by terrorists to carry out
attack inside Israel during the Jewish New Year, or Rosh Hashanah,
which fell on September 10.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army customarily imposes closure on the West Bank
and Gaza during holiday seasons out of security considerations,
barring tens of thousands of Palestinian labors from working in
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Former Rwandan Mayor Pleads Not Guilty at U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Former Rwandan mayor
Ignace Bagilishema pleaded not guilty Saturday at a U.N. tribunal
to seven counts contained in a new amended indictment.
</P>
<P>
The new plea follows a ruling by Trial Chamber 1 of the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) granting motions
by the Prosecutor for severance and amendment of the initial
indictment that had jointly charged the accused with seven other
persons.
</P>
<P>
The chamber also removed the Prosecution's proposed conspiracy
charge. The accused had on April 1 this year pleaded not guilty to
charges contained in the initial indictment.
</P>
<P>
In the new indictment, Bagilishema is charged with genocide,
crimes against humanity and serious violations of the Geneva
Conventions.
</P>
<P>
He is alleged to have murdered and conspired to murder
thousands of Tutsis in his town Mabanza as well as in Gitesi,
Gishyita and Gisovu towns within Kibuye Prefecture, the court
based in north Tanzania's Arusha town said in a press release
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Mabanza lies near Lake Kivu in the western prefecture of
Kibuye, which had the country's highest population of Tutsis
before the genocide.
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups estimate the Tutsi population in Kibuye
fell to only 8,000 in June 1994 from more than 250,000 in April
when the genocide started.
</P>
<P>
At least half a million people, mostly ethnic Tutsis and
moderate Hutus, were brutally massacred during April and July of
1994 in Rwanda. The United Nations Security Council decided to set
up ICTR in Arusha to try leading suspects responsible for the
genocide.
</P>
<P>
Bagilishema, 45, is alleged to have armed individuals and
directed them to attack Tutsis residing in Kibuye Prefecture. He
is said to have personally attacked and killed persons residing
and seeking refuge in Mabanza, Gatwaro stadium in Kibuye and Gitwa
Hill in the area of Bisesero.
</P>
<P>
The accused did commit other inhumane acts including, but not
limited to, persistently "searching for Tutsis, knowing leading
Tutsis to the massacre sites, and unlawfully confining the Tutsis
at Gatwaro stadium without water, sanitation or food, thereby
forcing the Tutsis to eat grass", the Prosecution told the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
On or about April 17 that year, the accused is alleged to have
ordered men, women and children into the Catholic Church and Home
St. Jean Complex, and Home St. Jean Complex, and into the stadium
in Kibuye, where he knew or had reason to know that an attack was
going to occur.
</P>
<P>
Massacres did take place and thousands of people inside the
complex and the stadium were killed or injured with the attackers
using guns, grenades, machetes, spears, cudgels and other weapons,
the Prosecution said.
</P>
<P>
On February 13 this year, Bagilishema, who turned up in South
Africa, signed a declaration agreeing to surrender himself to the
tribunal. On February 20, the tribunal served him with a warrant
of arrest in Pretoria, where he had been detained by South African
authorities in connection with his immigration status.
</P>
<P>
He was transferred to the tribunal detention facilities in
Arusha the same day.

there has been "substantial" violence in Bihar due to social and
ideological factors, adding that repolling in the state would

</P>
<P>
The highest turnout of 61 percent was reported in 19 Lok Sabha
seats in south Andhra Pradesh, where stray violence killed a
Congress activist.
</P>

minor incidents of booth capturing, PTI said.

<P>
NICOSIA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriots have
expressed concern over a U.N. proposal to appoint a Norwegian
diplomat as the U.N. Secretary General's Special Representative
for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Saturday that the Turkish
Cypriot side was fretting over Norway's reluctance to import
potatoes from northern Cyprus in compliance with a ruling of the
European Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
They were also discontented with the nominee, former Norwegian
Foreign Minister Jan Egeland, for his involvement in the
bicommunal formula in the solution to the Cyprus issue, something
the Turkish Cypriot side doesn't want to see.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side has insisted that their breakaway
state, now backed only by Ankara, be recognized by the
international community before they would agree to sit at the
negotiating table with the Greek Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
According to CNA, the Turkish Cypriots object to the
appointment of a European to the post.

<P>
Quoting U.N. sources, the CNA said Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash outlined his view over the nomination issue to the United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan at a meeting last week in New
York, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides has said that Chilean
diplomat James Holger would take the place of Ann Hercus as the
special representative until January 2000. Egeland is expected to
take over at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
Hercus, from New Zealand, launched contacts with Cyprus' two
sides last October in an effort to make progress towards easing
tension on the divided island and a settlement to the Cyprus
issue. She has resigned for personal reasons and will leave at the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bicommunal federation formula, but so far no tangible
results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.N. Committee of Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Trade Ministry on
Saturday accused the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking five of
its contracts signed under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed spokesman for the ministry blamed the U.S. and
British representatives at the Sanctions Committee for suspending
those five contracts during the committee's recent sessions held
on September 7 and September 13.
</P>
<P>
According to Iraqi News Agency, the spokesman said that these
blocked contracts included electricity generators and equipment
and spare parts for the oil, health, agriculture and higher
education sectors.
</P>
<P>
These contracts were signed with Chinese, French, Russian,
Vietnamese and Indian companies in the fifth and sixth phases of
the oil-for-food deal, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, now in its sixth phase which
expires in November, Iraq is allowed to sell limited amount of
oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the deal, the ceiling of the amount
of oil Iraq is allowed to sell has been raised to 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars from 2 billion dollars for the first three phases.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys in the
Sanctions Committee of hampering execution of its contracts,
saying the oil-for-food deal has failed to alleviate the suffering
of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> GCC States Support Maintaining Oil Production Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) on Saturday underlined the importance of maintaining
oil output cutbacks by producing countries in order to achieve a
stable market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the GCC oil ministers' meeting in Saudi capital
Riyadh, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) oil minister Obeid bin Saif
Al Nasir, who chaired the session, said "members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) should abide
by their March production restriction agreement."
</P>
<P>
OPEC members signed an accord last March to slash their daily
output by 1.7 million barrels, while non-OPEC nations agreed to
reduce production by 400,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the improvement of prices since the signing of the
agreement, which has recently pushed oil prices to over 20
U.S. dollars per barrel, the average annual level for 1999 is
still less than 15 dollars per barrel, much less than 20.29
dollars and 18.68 dollars in 1996 and 1997," Al Nasir said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is better to preserve market stability for the
benefit of both oil producing and consuming countries, "because
sudden change in prices could cause more economic crisis,"
according to the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting of the GCC oil chiefs was aimed at
coordinating positions ahead of an OPEC ministerial meeting
slated later this month in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Before the Riyadh meeting, some of the GCC states have voiced
satisfaction over the improvement of oil prices in the past few
months and promised a continuous adherence to the OPEC output
restriction agreement.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states, namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the UAE, account for about 46 percent of the world
crude reserves. Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are also
OPEC members.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Night "Lighted" against Sexual Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A "Light the Night" campaign
is urged in Canada's biggest city Toronto as a precaution against
a so-called "bedroom rapist", Canadian Media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Residents are being told to keep their outside lights on at
night until police arrest the serial sexual assaulter.
</P>
<P>
"Turn your lights on. The greatest ally of this sexual predator
is fear and his greatest weapon is darkness," Toronto Police Supt.
Jim Bamfor was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A single man is suspected of breaking into 12 homes in
northeast Toronto and sexually assaulting eight females ranging in
age from nine to 75 since June 2, the media said.
</P>
<P>
For days police have been going in search along a water run-off
canal, which they believe is a possible route to many of the homes
chosen to attack by the man.

<HEADLINE> China Worried about Its Table Tennis Supremacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, China, September 18 (Xinhua) -- At the moment, the name
of the game is China, but the Chinese seem to be worried about
that.
</P>
<P>
Table tennis, almost a national institution in the world most
populous country, is in the risk of losing its fans after the
immensely-talented Chinese paddlers were ready to turn every major
events into their domestic championships.
</P>
<P>
The China Grand Prix, an A-level International Table Tennis
Federation (ITTF) Pro-Tour event, wrapped up here today with the
host nation monopolizing all four gold medals on offer.
</P>
<P>
And it's the second time in less than 50 days.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a mighty Chinese contingent left the 45th table
tennis world championships and the tiny city of Eindhoven, Holland
all-conquering and full-handed, shutting non-Chinese paddlers out
of every final of the five categories.
</P>
<P>
So extensive is the Chinese supremacy that it would possibly be
detrimental to the game itself.
</P>
<P>
"The spectators would be bored if they are always seeing two
Chinese faces at the either side of the table," Lu Yuansheng, head
coach of the Chinese women's squad, said after he found out three
of the four finals of the China Grand Prix involved non-Chinese
presence.
</P>
<P>
"So the crowd will be treated to a real international
championships this afternoon, " he said.
</P>
<P>
But much to his disappointment, China, where table tennis is
hailed as the national sport, still made it four out of four, even
though their best players had perished in the early stages of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
In an anticlimax afternoon, Liu Guozheng, a last minute stand-
in for the injury-hit former world champion Kong Linhui, overcame
the equally unfancied finalist South Korean Lee Chul Seung to take
the men's singles gold, while the women's singles title went to Li
Ju, who scored a walk-over win because her opponent, Chinese-born
German Qianhong Gotsch suffered a fever and quit the match.
</P>
<P>
The men's doubles final, which pit China against South Korea,
failed to produce any sparkle as the Chinese duo Wang Liqin/Yan
Sen killed the match in less than 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
And the women's doubles event, as it always was, eventually
became an all-Chinese affair of which nobody would care about the
outcome but the players themselves.
</P>
<P>
"People begin to be missing the old days when China and Europe
were slugging it out in the men's competition while Chinese women
were fighting off Korean challenge," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"Monopoly would reduce the attractiveness of the game," he
added. "So what's the point of winning all the way ?"
</P>
<P>
Three Chinese top players, men's Liu Guoliang and Ma Lin and
women's Wang Nan, all turned in lackluster performances at the
three-day tournament, and it could be that they did not have a
strong will to win at all, Lu hinted.
</P>
<P>
Except that Liu Guoliang fell to his teammate and eventual
chamion Liu Guozheng, both Ma Lin, world number two, and Wang Nan,
world champion and top seed, went down to foreign opposition.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to get motivated after a world championship triumph.
You just can't work up yourself," Lu said of Wang Nan.
</P>
<P>
Ma Lin, a red-hot player on the world circuit after beating
Sweden legend Jan-ove Waldner and Belarusian star Vladimir
Samsonov at the worlds, was more blunt.
</P>
<P>
"We swept the board at the world championships and that would
harm the table tennis cause in the long term. The progress of the
game suffered setbacks in the world in recent years; people are
becoming indifferent (to the game) because they cannot achieve
nothing. It's losing grounds in many countries outside China," the
19-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
"So I'm afraid we should not have taken all these gold and
silver medals. We ought to hold back ourselves a little bit and
make some golds available for foreign players.
</P>
<P>
"You've got to live and let live," he said.

<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bournemouth men's tennis
semi-finals were washed out by heavy rain on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
High winds and heavy rain kept players and officials waiting
for four hours but the clay courts' inadequate drainage made it
impossible for play to take place on the south English coast.
</P>
<P>
"I was able to knock up for a couple of minutes but that was
all and I would be quite happy if we went indoors to play the semi-
finals," said top seed Thomas Enqvist of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
But the Swede's match against the improving 22-year-old
Austrian Stefan Koubek will be scheduled outdoors on Sunday at
0930 GMT. The other semi-final between Moroccan Younes El Aynaoui
and Romanian Adrian Voinea will take place at the same time.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Slamed for FA Cup Pull-Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Former Nottingham Forest
manager Brian Clough has blasted Manchester United's decision to
opt out of the FA Cup to play in the World Club Championship in
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Clough, who returns to the City Ground on Sunday for the
unveiling of a new stand named after him, never won the country's
premier knockout competition in a glittering managerial career.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Manchester United did football in this country
any favours dropping out of the FA Cup," he said. "I think it is
criminal. There's a trophy they have won several times and they
have given a spark of life to everybody who supports football.
They have been in Europe, winning it and now they have suddenly
pulled out."
</P>
<P>
Clough has stayed away from the City Ground since his
retirement in 1993 when Forest were relegated and appreciates that
current boss David Platt will have his work cut out restoring the
fortunes of the midlanders, who were European champions in 1979
and 1980.
</P>
<P>
Clough said: "They have got a good stadium - I left them with
that. I left them with a nucleus of a side. When Frank Clark got
them out of the First Division, nine or 10 of the players I left
were still there.
</P>
<P>
"They were in good habits and Frank broke the side up. Forest
kind of let things slide - it was a tragedy after what we had gone
through and what we won. We marched through Europe and nobody gave
us a chance, nobody.
</P>
<P>
"The structure was there when we left and it should have been
built on."
</P>
<P>
Clough hopes former England skipper Platt will restore fortunes
on the banks of the Trent.
</P>
<P>
"He has now got this terrible, gigantic job of rebuilding
everything. He is going to places and having a problem getting a
point away from home in the First Division; Swindon outplaying
them.
</P>
<P>
"I used to go to Old Trafford and Alex Ferguson was shaking in
his boots," Clough told BBC TV's Grandstand.

<HEADLINE> British Government Pressed For Answers as Third Spy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition Saturday
demanded Home Secretary Jack Straw to make a full explanation
about foreign agents after the third Briton in a week was unmasked
as a spy.
</P>
<P>
The BBC revealed that Robin Pearson, a lecturer in economic
history at Hull University, had spied for 12 years for East
Germany's Stasi secret police.
</P>
<P>
The allegation follows a few days after an 87-year-old British
great-grandmother, Melita Norwood, and a former policeman, John
Symonds, were named as former Soviet spies, based on KGB files
provided by Soviet defector Vasili Mitrokhin.
</P>
<P>
Ann Widdecombe, the opposition Conservatives' "shadow" home
secretary, said Straw should explain how many accused spies had
emerged as former Soviet bloc files have become available, how
serious the allegations were and whether Britain's Security
Service had kept ministers informed.
</P>
<P>
But a Home Office spokeswoman said Straw did not plan a
statement. She said Straw had first learned of the Pearson case
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The BBC said the Security Service, popularly known as MI5, had
known of Pearson's identity since 1994.
</P>
<P>
It said Pearson, who teaches economics at Hull University in
northeast England, had been recruited by the Stasi in 1977 while a
university student at Karl Marx University in Leipzig, and had
been given the codename of Armin.
</P>
<P>
Pearson declined to comment on the allegations.

<HEADLINE> British Couple Flees over Baby's HIV Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A British couple who have been
ordered to have their baby daughter tested for the Aids virus
chose to leave the country instead of going through with the test,
a British newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago the High Court in London ruled that the baby had
a "right to life" and needed the test because the mother was found
HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
But the girl's parents refused, saying it is down to them to
make decisions on behalf of their five-month-old child.
</P>
<P>
The couple told the Daily Mail shortly before they left their
home that they would not be present at the test, which is due to
be carried out in London on 24 September.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper does not reveal where they have fled to.
</P>
<P>
The adamant couple said they did not want the state to
intervene in the upbringing of their daughter, who is being
breastfed.
</P>
<P>
The mother said she does not believe doctors' warnings that the
HIV virus can be passed to baby through breast milk.
</P>
<P>
"We are also totally against HIV testing", she said, "In any
event I think the tests are meaningless and not indicative of ill
health."

<HEADLINE> New Singapore Exchange to Start Business in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced Saturday that the Singapore
Exchange (SE), an integrated exchange to be merged by the Stock
Exchange of Singapore (SES) and the Singapore International
Monetary Exchange (SIMEX), will start business on December 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that a good team of able and dedicated staff from SES
and SIMEX is being enlarged and strengthened for the challenges
ahead.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister also announced that the Pro-Tem
Committee Chairman J.Y. Pillay will become chairman of the new
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the announcement in his 19-page speech delivered at
the SIMEX 15th anniversary celebration dinner.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said the pro-tem committee and the exchange's
management have been developing new strategies for the Singapore
Exchange with an aim to develop the capital market infrastructure
of Singapore to serve the Asian markets and to support the
continued growth of Singapore as an international financial
center.
</P>
<P>
The plan requires the Singapore Exchange to become more
business-oriented and customer driven, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the initiatives contained in the plan, Lee
elaborated that these initiatives are to bolster the
Singapore-based business, to grow the business across borders
through strategic alliances and to extend the business portfolio
to diversify the earnings mix.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said the Singapore Exchange will need
some time to implement these business strategies.
</P>
<P>
"But whichever way the business develops, one certainty is that
Asian capital markets will grow," Lee added.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government set in motion changes to the
structure of its exchanges last year and the Exchanges
(Demutualization and Merger) Act was passed by the Parliament on
August 4 this year.

OTTAWA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Ottawa has seen more buyers
this year than last of high-end homes, which are usually priced at
350,000 Canadian dollars (about 236,6000 U.S. dollars) or more,
the Ottawa Citizen Newspaper reported Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Natural Gas Output Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Mexican natural gas
output has gone from 3.759 billion cubic feet a day in 1995 to
4.924 billion cubic feet a day in 1999, an increase of 1.165
billion cubic feet a day.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas production had an average annual growth of 8.4
percent during the 1995-1998 period, according to statistics
supplied today by the state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex).
</P>
<P>
Pemex said that this increase is noticeable compared to the
levels registered between 1991 and 1994, when the production of
this fuel remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas production during the 1991-1994 period went from
2.675 billion cubic feet per day to 2.685 million cubic feet per
day.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican oil company attributed the production increase
registered in the recent years to the bigger use of natural gas,
mainly in thermoelectric plants, to contribute to improve the
quality of the environment.
</P>
<P>
Pemex estimates Mexico's demand of natural gas will be 6.888
billion cubic feet per day by the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Build Rural Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia announced
Saturday that it plans to construct more than 100,000 kilometers
of rural roads in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tesfamicael Nahusenay, general manager of the Ethiopian Road
Authority (ERA) said that the initiative includes the renovation,
asphalting and gravelling of 20,500 kilometers of roads in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Timely maintenance activities will also be undertaken to set
better standards for about 60 percent of the roads in the country
by the year 2002, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 14.539 billion birr (about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars)
is required for the implementation of the project, the general
manager said, adding the expenditure will be paid by the central
government and donor organizations.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has long been troubled with bad roads both in suburban
and rural areas, which, experts and investors said, have
remarkably hampered the development of country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The ERA's decision to repair and build new roads has
demonstrated the government's determination to improve road
condition throughout the Horn of Africa country.

launched in Arusha, Tanzania, in June of 1998, adding that the
security has been greatly improved in the last 12 months apart
from some recent cases of violence caused by elements who had
slipped into the country to terrorize the population.
</P>
<P>
There is no war in Burundi but some cases of insecurity, he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
But he appealed to regional leaders to work to speed up the
peace process so that the negotiations can be concluded and total
peace re- established in his country.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Build Rural Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia announced
Saturday that it plans to construct more than 100,000 kilometers
of rural roads in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tesfamicael Nahusenay, general manager of the Ethiopian Road
Authority (ERA) said that the initiative includes the renovation,
asphalting and gravelling of 20,500 kilometers of roads in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Timely maintenance activities will also be undertaken to set
better standards for about 60 percent of the roads in the country
by the year 2002, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 14.539 billion birr (about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars)
is required for the implementation of the project, the general
manager said, adding the expenditure will be paid by the central
government and donor organizations.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has long been troubled with bad roads both in suburban
and rural areas, which, experts and investors said, have
remarkably hampered the development of country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The ERA's decision to repair and build new roads has
demonstrated the government's determination to improve road
condition throughout the Horn of Africa country.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Produce 2.1 Million Tons of Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique expects to produce
about 2.1 million tons of grain next year, an increase of 15
percent over the 1999 figure, Agriculture Minister Carlos
Agostinho do Rosario said Friday.
</P>
<P>
While officially opening the 1999/2000 agricultural campaign in
the northern province of Nampula, Rosario said the expansion would
not just be in maize, but also in rice, Mozambique News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in grain production is very significant for
Mozambique, since it means a large reduction in imports and an
increase in the export of foodstuffs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rosario said that Mozambique has now achieved self-sufficiency
in maize, and this year there was a surplus of 180,000 tons
available for export to other countries in southern and eastern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
As for beans and groundnuts, the government targets for an
output of 413,000 tons, which would be an increase of 23 percent
over the 1999 figure. The output of cassava should grow by 16
percent to reach 6.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to Rosario, the total area under cultivation will
rise to 3.9 million hectares, an increase of four percent against
the 1998/99 agricultural campaign.
</P>
<P>
These predictions are based on encouraging weather forecasting
for the coming months. Meteorologists from southern Africa met in
Maputo last Wednesday, saying the coming rainy season will be
favorable for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
But Mozambique faces a shortage of seeds, the government said,
adding that 1,689 tons of maize, rice, sorghum and millet seeds
are needed.
</P>
<P>
The government, with the support of Italy, the World Food
Program and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, plans to
help those areas hit by floods or drought in the last agricultural
year and provide them with seeds and tools.

Wang Ganchang concealed his identity for 17 years for guarding
state secrets and for his personal safety, dedicating his life to
the course of the development of nuclear weapons. In the early
1940s, he was already a renowned physicist.
</P>
<P>
Peng Huanwu, a well-known theoretical physicist, received two
Ph.Ds in Great Britain and was known as the first Chinese to claim
the title of "professor" in Britain. When asked why he returned to
China, Peng said that "it needs no explanation for coming back," "
because I am a Chinese."
</P>
<P>
Guo Yonghuai, a famous expert on mechanics, refused to be
involved in any secret research work in the United States in order
to come back to China smoothly. These three men became the country

</P>
<P>
In 1963 the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (
CPC) decided to move the staff researching atomic power to a newly-
built research base for nuclear weapons in Hai'an County in
northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
The scientists and their families gladly responded to the

BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The development of atomic
warheads, the H-bomb, missiles and satellites has played an
important role in helping China attain its current international
status as a nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
China detonated its first atomic bomb on October 16, 1964, and
its first H-bomb on June 17, 1967. It fired its first ground-to-
ground missile with a nuclear warhead on October 27, 1966. On
April 24, 1970, it put its first satellite into orbit. And on July
15, 1999, the country announced that during the 1980s, it had
mastered the crucial technology necessary for producing neutron
bombs.
</P>
<P>
These achievements were made by dozens of scientists at the
China Engineering Physics Research Institute, including Wang
Ganchang, Peng Huanwu, and Guo Yonghuai.
</P>
<P>
"We should not be without (nuclear power) in order not to be
bullied by others in today's world," late Chinese leader Mao
Zedong pointed out, in response to the fact that the United States
was boasting of its nuclear weapons not long after the People's
Republic of China was founded in October 1949.
</P>
<P>
A special institution specializing in the research of nuclear
weapons was founded in 1958, attracting many university graduates
and even famous scientists from abroad. It was predecessor of the

At 3 p.m. (Beijing Time) on October 16, 1964, China's first
atomic bomb exploded in the vast northwestern desert, putting an
end to the history of oppression from foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
"The bomb, in the shape of mushroom cloud, symbols the strong
spirit of the Chinese nation," said an overseas Chinese journalist.
</P>
<P>
The development of China's nuclear power entered a new,
important stage in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Late leader Deng Xiaoping said at the time, "I am most
interested in using strategic nuclear weapons in modern guerrilla
warfare." He also believed that small and mobile nuclear weapons
should be a development goal in the country's research program.
</P>
<P>
The United States has conducted more than 1,000 nuclear tests,
while China has only done 45.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, President Jiang Zemin inspected the research base
for nuclear weapons and set important guidelines. He also invited
the scientists such as Zhu Guangya, Yu Min and Hu Renyu to
Zhongnanhai, the compound where China's top leaders work, to draft
a plan for further development of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the build-up of the country's defense
system, especially the development of some advanced weapons, is of
great significance in safeguarding China's economic development
and national security.
</P>
<P>
"We would not have been so strong in the world if we had not
possessed atomic and hydrogen bombs, missiles and satellites,"
Jiang said.

It is the strong sense of responsibility and hard work of the
scientists involved in the development of the atomic and hydrogen
bombs that enabled China to have its own nuclear weapons in just
26 months; the world's most developed countries took years to
accomplish the task.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, the scientists carried out their research in
spite of extremely hard living conditions. Their research base was
located in an area 3,000 meters above sea level. The lowest
temperature there was 40 degrees below zero, and the cold winter
season lasted between eight and nine months.
</P>
<P>
The strong-willed scientists overcame the hardships, arranging
for factories, railway lines, and roads to be built on the barren
land. They also grew their own vegetables and grain, and raised
livestock to solve the food shortage, said Zhang Aiping, a
military general who participated in the research project.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the difficulties, the former Soviet Union had broken
its agreement with China to provide China with teaching models and
related designs and materials on atomic bomb in June of 1959 and
recalled its technicians and experts home, so they were on their
own.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Deng Jiaxian, a young scientist, began formulating the
theoretical designs for nuclear weapons together with young
undergraduates in April 1960.
</P>
<P>
They had no computers at that time, but had to use hand-held
calculators to do the many and varied computations. They spent six
months checking their results.

<P>
And Chen Nengkuan, a well-known Chinese metals physicist, led a
team of over 30 technicians to hand-make spare parts for the
nuclear weapons. Everyone was exposed to toxic fumes and explosive
flammable materials during the work.
</P>
<P>
The first A-bomb was detonated in northwest China in October,
1964.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1960, scientists He Zuoxiu, Yu Min, and Huang
Zuqia from the Institute of Atomic Energy, were asked to start the
research and experimentation of the first hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
All they had to work with were some tables, chairs, several
rulers and a blackboard, but they were not discouraged. More
scientists and experts, including Zhou Guangzhao, Peng Yuanwu, and
Deng Jiaxian, joined in after they finished their A-bomb research.
</P>
<P>
"Nuclear weapons are crucial for ensuring national security. As
a young and big country, China could not survive without its own
nuclear weapons. We are quite willing to labor for the cause of
our motherland," said Yu Min, a world-renowned theoretical
physicist.
</P>
<P>
These men made a great breakthrough in the study of hydrogen
bomb theory in October 1965, and the first H-bomb exploded on June
17, 1967.
</P>
<P>
It took the United States more than seven years to invent the
first A-bomb and make strides in the H-bomb theory, while Britain,
four and a half years, and the former Soviet Union, four years.
</P>
<P>
China spent just 26 months on the entire project, an
extraordinary feat in the eyes of the world.

These Chinese scientists have devoted their lives to the
motherland. It is not uncommon for young scientists and
technicians to delay their weddings in order to complete research,
and their time at home with family is severely limited.
</P>
<P>
Around 1970, the China Research Institute of Engineering
Physics moved from the Qinghai Plateau to a remote mountain area
in Sichuan. The scientists and technicians had to shuttle between
the deep mountain area and desert areas for their research and
experiments.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, 51-year-old engineer Song Daben contracted a fatal
disease, but he spent the last 81 days of his life at his computer.
</P>
<P>
In his last letter to his parents, he said, "I'm sorry I spent
so little time taking care of my family. I miss you very much and
I think you will be proud of me because I have been making
contributions for the country."
</P>
<P>
At the institute, elder scientists who have sacrificed so
dearly for the country's nuclear weapons research are fostering
the younger generation of scientists.
</P>
<P>
In spite of temptations offered by China's market economy, the
young scientists have resisted high-paying jobs in order to work
for the development of the country's nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Enlarged Airstrip Near Somali Capital Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Issaley airstrip, some
15 kilometers north of the Somali capital Mogadishu, came into
operation again Sunday after rehabilitation and expansion for the
international use.
</P>
<P>
The Camel Trading and Transportation Company has solely
invested 700,000 U.S. dollars in the four-month rehabilitation of
the airstrip to enlarge it to the international standard in length
and in width.
</P>
<P>
The runway of Issaley airstrip, controlled by faction leader
Ali Mahdi Mohamed, has expanded to 2,500 meters in length and 32
meters in width.
</P>
<P>
According to the owner of the Camel Company, Bashir Rageh
Shirar, the expansion has made the airport capable of handling the
medium weight airplanes of about 35 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to the engineers who reconstructed the airport, the
small Cesna planes, the medium weight Russian-made Tupolov-18 and
the Boeing planes with propellers can use this new facility, while
the large Boeing planes with jet engines will need more concrete
tarmac runway.
</P>
<P>
This new installation has also been equipped with fire
extinguishers and portable air-traffic control system which is
mounted on a vehicle inside the airport.
</P>
<P>
Over 350 heavily armed militiamen are also made ready for
working on security.
</P>
<P>
According to Shirar, it will take his company four to five
years of continuous operation of the airport to gain his
investment back.
</P>
<P>
But the company may face its worst economic set-back ever in
history if the reconciliation process leads to the reopening of
the international airport of the capital before Camel Company gets
back its money.
</P>
<P>
According to the administration of the airport which remains
the same as before, nothing much will change in charging the
international flights, but the charge will very much depend on the
weight of each respective plane.
</P>
<P>
"The minimum landing fee is 100 dollars for the small aircraft,
but the larger ones will be dealt with accordingly," Shirar said,
adding that the policy of charging the passengers has slightly
been changed by reducing from 45 dollars to 25 dollars for the
foreigners and from 25 dollars to 15 dollars for the local
residents.
</P>
<P>
The administration of the airport has also announced that all
kinds of contraband including weapons, illegal drugs with the
exception of khat (a kind of chewed stimulant) and female
livestock and wildlife exportation won' t be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people including dignitaries and local elders
witnessed the inauguration of the Issaley airstrip which had
started operating during the civil strife when Mogadishu was
bisected into at least two hostile parts.

<HEADLINE> Africa Targets to Reduce Poverty by Half by 2015: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Africa is set to reduce
poverty by half by the year 2015, the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) has said.
</P>
<P>
But ECA Executive Secretary K.Y. Amuako noted recently that the
economy of the whole African continent needs to grow by seven
percent, up from the present four percent to achieve that goal by
2015.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of low human development countries - countries
with high population growth rates, low income, low literacy and
low life expectancy - are in Africa, according to an ECA report
available here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Four of every 10 Africans live in conditions of absolute
poverty, and recent evidence suggests that poverty on the
continent is increasing, said the latest issue of Economic Report
on Africa 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Amuako expressed his belief that both southern and
northern Africa have the resources and the favorable conditions to
meet the poverty reduction target.
</P>
<P>
The ECA report said that Africa's economy has recorded a growth
rate of 3.3 percent in 1998, exceeding the 2.9 percent rate of the
previous year and the population growth rate of 2.8 percent per
year.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth consecutive year during which per capita
income has increased, it added, noting that the growth rate in
Africa was the highest in the world.

cradle to nourish athletes of potentials, the Chinese City Games,
in its fourth edition, witness a string of teenager stars in its
ten-day competitions which concluded here on Sunday.
</P>

Hui defeated an Asian mark to take the women's 200-meter
breaststroke in 2:26.51, the lone Asian record in the swimming

sports in the provincial and municipal levels," said Shang Xiutang,

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A British government minister
and a team of leading builders are flying to Turkey to see how to
help rebuild the country after its devastating earthquake,
according to a BBC report on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nick Raynsford, Britain's Minister of State, Environment and
Transport, is leading the delegation on a five-day visit to areas
hit by the quake on August 17, which killed more than 15,500
people.
</P>
<P>
He will meet his Turkish counterparts and hold talks with
mayors of some of the worst-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
"The tragic consequences of the earthquake have presented
Turkey with an immense challenge in dealing with the necessary
redevelopment and reconstruction work," Raynsford was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister believed that British companies have the skills
and expertise that are needed in the rebuilding, both in the short
and medium term.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that half-a-million Turkish people have been
made homeless by the earthquake. They are currently living in
tents and temporary accommodation.

<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- China's financial sector
successfully completed its third and final Y2K-compliance test
today, resuming operations at noon after a 24-hour shutdown.
</P>
<P>
The banking, insurance, and postal savings sectors in China
have already undergone two thorough testing periods, from June 19
to 20, and from July 17 to 18, under the guidance of the People's
Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's central bank.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for PBOC said the successful testing showed the
preparedness of China's financial sector for Y2K, the millennium
bug.
</P>
<P>
The financial sector, a key sector that will be most affected
by Y2K, will focus on improving its contingency programs and
training of personnel as the next step to bring the country safely
into the next century, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The third test, which was carried out between 12 a.m. on
September 18 and 12 a.m. on September 19, highlighted the

<HEADLINE> Swimmer Jin Hao Wins Sixth Gold in Poor Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, China, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Swimmer Jin Hao became
the most versatile athlete by taking six gold medals in the fourth
Chinese City Games which concluded all its competitions here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jin Hao, 20, clocked 4:24.51 to take the men's 400m individual
medley tonight after earlier victories in the 200m, 400m and 1,
500m freestyles, the 200m butterfly and 200m medley.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure of securing the berth in the national squad for the
2000 Olympic Games in Sydney," said the 400m freestyle national
champion.
</P>
<P>
However, all his winning marks lag far behind the national
marks, not to mention the Asian records.
</P>
<P>
"Our athletes have displayed their overall levels in the
swimming competitions, and 90 percent swimmers of the national
squad are under the age of 20 and have competed in the Games,"
said Zhang Qiuping, assistant director of the Chinese Swimming
Training Center.
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing that is nagging us is that our athletes
usually had a very short period of great results while our
overseas opponents even break world records in their elder ages,"
lamented the Chinese swimming official.
</P>
<P>
From the swimming pool, only Qi Hui, a 14-year-old teenager,
made the great splash by surpassing a lone Asian record in winning
the women's 200-meter breaststroke 2:26.51.
</P>
<P>
"My winning timing of an Asian mark will push me for more
titles in the international arena in the coming years as it will
become both a pressure and an impetus for me to achieve better
results in the future," said Qi Hui.
</P>
<P>
Although the swimming agenda witnessed the great names of world
record-holder Chen Yan, world champion Chen Hua and Han Xue, those
women swimmers only managed for a few titles, all in poor results.

<HEADLINE> Scholar Expects Breakthroughs in SOE Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- He holds many prestigious
titles, but most Chinese know him as "Stock Man Li," one of the
economists who first advocated the shareholding system in China.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese intellectuals who are my age grew up with new China
over the past five decades, and my ideas about economics changed
several times," said Li Yining, 69, president of Guanghua
Management School of Beijing University, who is thinking back over
the past 50 years of his life.
</P>
<P>
In 1951 Li left his hometown Yizheng, in east China's Jiangsu
Province, to study economics at Beijing University, an elite
school in China.
</P>
<P>
"My education was strongly influenced by the Soviet Union's
economic system, which made me firmly believe that China's
socialist economic construction would proceed smoothly forward,"
said Li, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, China's top legislative body.
</P>
<P>
However, plagued by natural disaster, China experienced three
extremely difficult years from 1959-1961, following the "Great
Leap Forward" when impossibly high-yields were encouraged in
agricultural and industrial production.
</P>
<P>
"I once asked myself: Is natural disaster all to blame? But my
suspicion went no further than that at that time," Li said.

<TEXT>
<P>
During the "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976), Li and a number
of professors from Beijing University were labeled right-wing and
forced to work in rural areas. "For the first time I witnessed the
dog-poor situation of the Chinese farmers, which I have thought
about for a long time," said Li, who was ordered to ten years of
hard labor.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the third plenary session of the Eleventh
National People's Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1978
changed Li's life forever.
</P>
<P>
The policy of reform and opening up gave fresh hope to Li, who
began to publish books and publicly announce his economic ideas in
1979.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1980, Li Yining brought up the idea of
restructuring China's state-owned enterprises (SOE) through a
shareholding system, but few people accepted the idea, calling it
capitalist.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proved that the shareholding system does not only
belong to the capitalist economy. It suits China. The only thing
is that the idea should have been promoted earlier. If it had been,
SOE reform would not be as difficult as it is today," Li pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
"I'm expecting new breakthroughs in SOE reform," Li said,
adding that the next step for SOE reform should include
diversification of investment channels, reduction of state share
proportion, and promotion of related reforms.

<P>
Li's advocating of the shareholding system is only a fraction
of his overall contribution to economics in China. He also
contributed significantly to the promulgation of the Securities
Law, and has a brilliant grasp of Western economic thought.
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Li is unlike his predecessors and proteges, all
of whom studied abroad. Li is a typical Chinese scholar, born and
bred. Explaining why his thoughts have had such profound influence
on China, he said because "my bitter experience has made me fully
understand the true condition of China."
</P>
<P>
He believes that a successful economist should make outstanding
contributions to his motherland at its crucial development stage,
and must take into full consideration the country's own conditions.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no one could believe that the ambition of the economist,
teacher and legislator was to become a chemist, someone who could
help make China a strong industrial country.
</P>
<P>
And the man who has published 50-plus books on economics is
also a poet. His 300 poems, written during a 50-year period, are
actually a microcosm of his own life experience.
</P>
<P>
He published a collection of 100 of his poems last year, which
has been popular among scholars.

<HEADLINE> UK Says "Powerless" to Stop Jets Delivery to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Sunday it was
powerless to prevent the delivery of three Hawk trainer jets to
Indonesia, despite last week's arms embargo prompted by the
outbreak of violence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Minister John Spellar said that the jets had
already been legally sold to Indonesia and nothing could be done
to stop their delivery.
</P>
<P>
"Delivery was taken by the Indonesians before the embargo,
indeed before the current crisis." he told Sky News.
</P>
<P>
"They are actually in the ownership of the Indonesians but
obviously in the spirit of the embargo we would prefer that they
did not go to Indonesia." Spellar said.
</P>
<P>
The trainer jets, built by British Aerospace, are currently in
Thailand en route to Indonesia, where reports said they had to
land after one pilot became ill during their journey from Britain.
</P>
<P>
The British government, following the U.S. decision to block
arms sales to Indonesia, put an embargo in place only last weekend.
Under the embargo, all new military sales to Indonesia have been
suspended.

<HEADLINE> Chinese City Games Conclude All Competitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, China, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Chinese City
Games concluded all its competitions here on Sunday with the best-
ever results achieved in its 10-day agenda.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three world junior records were surpassed by 33 athletes,
20 Asian marks were beaten by 23 competitors and 19 world records
were conquered by 22 people, with the great feats crowded in the
weightlifting and shooting competitions, said Wu Shouzhang,
director of the competition commission of the fourth City Games.
</P>
<P>
"The promising thing is that our athletes are making progresses
in their weak events," said the Chinese sports official.
</P>
<P>
Strongman Shi Zhiyong, 19, beat two world records in the snatch
and the two-lift total in the 62kg class, while sharp shooter Ge
Hong achieved the feat in the opening day shooting competitions
for a world junior record of 595 points in the men's 10m air rifle.
</P>
<P>
The track and field competitions also produced two Asian junior
records in both the women's pole vault and the women's 4x400m
relay.
</P>
<P>
And 14-year-old teenager swimmer Qi Hui surpassed a lone Asian
record to take the women's 200-meter breaststroke in 2:26.51 in
the swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of our shooters in the national squad have their
steady performances and it's a healthy sign that a few new faces
show up in the City Games," said Sun Shengwei, chief coach of the
Chinese national shooting squad.
</P>
<P>
"China still enjoys its advantages in its traditional strong
events, and we hope to surpass the three golds achieved in the
23rd Olympic Games by the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
However, concerned officials in other sports are worried about
the prospects in the future as neither Asian mark nor world record
was surpassed at the track and field, and few budding stars
emerged in the swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
Although runners coached by Ma Junren took more than five gold
medals, but none of them made any impressive marks, a big contrast
to the national games wherein several world records were broken by
his women disciplines in 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jin Hao, a 20-year-old swimmer, became the most versatile
athlete by taking six gold medals, but none of them are close to
the national marks, not to mention the Asian records.
</P>
<P>
Many a Chinese coach worries most of the lack of young athletes
of great potentials.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt Makes Progress in Good Governance: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister
Shah A. M. S. Kibria said on Sunday that the government led by
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had already achieved much progress in
the access to good governance in all spheres since assuming power
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The minister was addressing the launching ceremony of the
"Human Development Report in South Asia, 1999" here Sunday. The
report, third of its kind since 1997, was prepared by Mahbub-u-Huq
Human Development Center in Islamabad, which was established by
Dr. Mahbub-u-Huq, chief architect of the UNDP Human Development
Report.
</P>
<P>
The report analyzes issues of governance from political,
economic, social and civic perspectives providing an in-depth idea
of the phenomenon of corruption and advocating a concrete and
realistic reform agenda for promoting "Humane Governance" in the
region.
</P>
<P>
On the present government's managerial capability, Kibria said
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's administration has set a unique
example through timely handling the century's worst flood last
year and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
Among other innovative steps taken by the government, the
minister mentioned the reform measures being implemented in key
sectors that helped reduce corruption considerably along with an
improvement in the law and order situation all over the country.
</P>
<P>
This year's human development report ranks Bangladesh at 57th
among the countries of the world in "humane governance" index,
while India is put at 55th, Pakistan 54th, and Sri Lanka at 41st
positions.
</P>
<P>
On the poverty alleviation program of Bangladesh, the report
said that Bangladesh has taken considerable measures to address
poverty through building a larger human capital base. The total
allocation of social sector development in 1998-99 was 18 percent
of the total government expenditures.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Tours Beijing Ahead of 50th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today toured Beijing, the national capital that is undergoing a
blitz of construction and other eye-popping changes in the days
leading up to the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang visited the newly-widened Ping'an Street, accompanied by
Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao, Beijing's Communist party chief Jia
Qinglin and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
The president praised the Beijing authorities for paying
attention to the preservation of ancient buildings and cultural
relics along the street during the expansion.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently delighted to see the clear water in newly-
dredged Shishahai Lake, adjacent to the street, and the flowers
that have been placed on the bank.
</P>
<P>
At one point, he got out of his car and shook hands with
citizens, spending leisurely moments with them, and even hugged a
three-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
Gesturing toward the clear water, the trees and the flowers,
Jiang said that great changes have taken place in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He told Beijing officials that the capital should have more
such places where citizens could breath fresh air and exercise in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also toured the newly-widened Second and Third ring roads,
as well as Dongsihuan Road, which has just opened to the traffic.
</P>
<P>
Standing on the Sihui Overpass at the intersection of
Dongsihuan Road and Chang'an Street, Jiang was briefed on the
capital's new roads construction by Beijing Vice-Mayor Wang
Guangtao.
</P>
<P>
The president was told that the Sihui Overpass, occupying an
area of 35 hectares and boasting 60,000 square meters of road
space, is Beijing's largest overpass.
</P>
<P>
While passing the new lawn at Qianmen, the newly renovated Tian
'anmen, Chang'an Street and the Xizhimen Overpass, Jiang said he
appreciated the efforts of Beijing municipal government to reduce
traffic jams, cleaning up the environment and beautify the city.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also visited the newly-opened Wangfujing Street, Beijing'
s most famous shopping street, where Asia's largest single
building, the Oriental Square is almost finished.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted by a large number of workers in front of a
building with music fountain. The president asked about the
project's investment and the progress of the construction work.

<HEADLINE> Tehran, Riyadh to Cooperate in Choosing OPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Saudi Arabia have
decided to cooperate, rather than fight, with each other in
bidding for the post of secretary general of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The two have "accepted a joint decision supporting each other's
candidates for two consecutive three-year stint as OPEC secretary
general," said Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency,
Zanganeh, who rently toured Saudi Arabia on pilgrimage, said Iran
has no disagreement whatsoever with Saudi Arabia in this matter.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has presented its candidate for the post while
Iran, a founding member of OPEC which has not been at the helm of
the organization since 40 years ago, not thinks it deserves the
post.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh hailed the qualification and professional credentials
of Iran's candidate, Hossein Kazem-Pour Ardebili.
</P>
<P>
Ardebili is a member of board of directors of the 12-member
club of oil producers.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Minister in the
Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon and Palestinian Cabinet
Minister in Charge of Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini met here
Sunday to discuss the Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which took place at the Prime Minister's Office,
was closed to the press.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli official said the meeting was centered on the
activities of the "Orient House" in East Jerusalem, but he
refrained from giving give more details.
</P>
<P>
The "Orient House" is actually a Palestinian representative
office in East Jerusalem under the leadership of Husseini.
</P>
<P>
The "Orient House" had become a hot political issue before
Israel's May elections.
</P>
<P>
The Security cabinet of the previous government led by former
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued orders on April 22 to
close three Palestinian offices inside the house, accusing them of
conducting political and diplomatic activities.
</P>
<P>
The closing orders received strong objections not only from
the Palestinian side, but also from several Israeli peace groups
and individuals.
</P>
<P>
On May 10, 10 Israelis petitioned the High Court of
Israel, saying the closing orders had political motives and were
aimed at campaigning the elections. The High Court accepted the
petition and decided to give its final judgement on the matter
after the elections.
</P>
<P>
Ramon is also in charge of Jerusalem affairs in the Israeli
cabinet.

LAGOS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior United Nations
official has appealed to the international community to treat the
security crisis in west Africa with the same urgency that it
applied to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees Soren
Jessen-Petersen said in Sierra Leonean capital Freetown Saturday
that there was an urgent need for more aid to help some 500,000
war-created refugees in the west African country.

It was only by doing so, could the fragile peace achieved in

saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was vital that the country's peace process
should be supported and that refugees from the brutal conflict
should be helped to return home.
</P>
<P>
But the international community had not responded with
sufficient cash to the humanitarian crisis in Sierra Leone or to
the related conflicts in neighboring Liberia and Guinea, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to problems in Sierra Leone, a new crisis is
recently brewing between Liberia and Guinea, which has created a

The score was 25-6, 25-18 and 25-13 in favor of China.

"I fielded all my players in this match in order to let them

World runners-up China proved too much stronger than their
opponents in the first set when they fielded the first line-up who
produced powerful spikes and solid blocks from captain Sun Yue, Wu
Yongmei and debutant Zhao Ruirui.
</P>
<P>
It was the first international match for veteran Sun in almost
three months. She injured her left knee in the final of Swiss
international masters tournament against Cuba in June.
</P>
<P>
Compared with her form in the past, Sun said it was just 70
percent to that.
</P>
<P>
In the second and third sets, the Chinese played more relaxed
and controlled the match though making a few unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
"You know the Chinese is world runners-up, they are too strong
for us," said Uzbekistan head coach Ayrapetyants Leonid.
</P>
<P>
He added that China was top favorite to take the title.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan ranked sixth in last championship in Philippines in
1997 when they lost to China 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Other matches held on Sunday went as expected though Japan was
forced to four sets before beating Thailand 3-1.
</P>
<P>
In other Sunday action, Chinese Taipei, who finished fourth
last championship two years ago, beat Hong Kong, China, 3-0 while
runners-up South Korea beat Australia 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the above eighth teams, Kazahkstan is the ninth
participating in the eight-day tournament. The top teams, together
with hosts Japan, will clinch the berths for the World Cup
tournament to be held in Japan in November.

<HEADLINE> Five of Saudi Prince's Entourage Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court on Sunday
sentenced five people with connections to Saudi Prince Turki ben
Abdel Aziz to prison terms ranging from six months to two years
with hard labor for attacking a policeman in a Cairo hotel.
</P>
<P>
Cairo's Bolak Misdemeanor Court sentenced the prince's
brother-in-law, Fahd Mohammed al-Fassi, his friend, Abdellah
Terad, and his Syrian driver, Firas Ahmad Tayyar, to six months in
prison with hard labor, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Turki Mohammed al-Fassi, another brother-in-law of Prince
Turki, was sentenced in absentia to one year in prison with hard
labor. He was also fined 3,000 Egyptian pounds (880 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
An Austrian bodyguard, whose name was not available, was
sentenced in absentia to two years in prison with hard labor and a
fine of 5,000 pounds (1,470 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The men were tried after a complaint was submitted by off-duty
police officer Emad Mohamed Abaza, in which he said the five
assaulted him in the cafeteria of Ramses Hilton Hotel in Cairo in
June this year.
</P>
<P>
The court also ordered each of the accused to pay 501 pounds
(147 dollars) to Abaza.
</P>
<P>
The court rejected a case filed against Abaza by two of the
men, who claim the police officer beat them up.
</P>
<P>
There have been numerous complaints against Prince Turki's
family and his bodyguards since they moved into the upper floors
of the hotel in 1983 after a dispute with his brother, Saudi King
Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Former employees have accused the prince of mistreatment and
withholding payment. In 1997, one of the prince's American
bodyguards was arrested for punching two men who complained about
his blocking a Cairo street with his car. Three other bodyguards
were deported after similar complaints.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a Cairo court sentenced in absentia an
American bodyguard of Prince Turki to one year in prison for
assaulting an Egyptian cook. The bodyguard was also fined 5,000
pounds (1,470 dollars).

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Probes Cause of Killing Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- While South African
defense officials are playing down the suggestion that the killing
spree by Sibusiso Madubela on Thursday morning was race-related,
mother of the killer insisted that her son was the victim of
racial abuse.
</P>
<P>
The black lieutenant shot dead six white officers and a
civilian female employee before being gunned down in the exchange
of fire at the Tempe military base in Bloemfontein.
</P>
<P>
The mother of Madubela, Tiny Madubela told the Sunday Times
that her son had been stabbed by a white colleague at the base in
a racial incident, but there was no record of the stabbing on
Madubela's file at the base.
</P>
<P>
"My son has been a victim of racism at work. He was once
stabbed by his white colleague and had been complaining for years
that his white colleagues had been victimizing him," said the
mother.
</P>
<P>
Madubela was a former member of the guerrilla Azanian People's
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Madubela opened fire on the white officers
after his pay was suspended as punishment for absence without
leave for seven days after he took five days leave to attend his
father's funeral.
</P>
<P>
However, another Sunday newspaper, City Press, reported that
the military authorities wrongly charged Madubela for going absent
without leave.
</P>
<P>
Madubela had in fact applied for leave, which was granted, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of a mistake by the authorities, who apparently
believed Madubela had deserted his post, his salary was frozen,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
It is believed this angered Madubela and led to his shooting
the people he blamed for this mistake as well as a string of other
grievances.
</P>
<P>
The paper also found that Madubela was a somber man, contrary
to reports that he was an "irresponsible drunk".

<HEADLINE> Auriol Ends Win Drought to Claim First China Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUAIROU, Beijing, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Didier
Auriol, driving a Toyota Corolla, snapped his World Rallying
Championship win drought for more than a year to claim a decisive
victory in the first world championship event conducted in China
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Auriol, winless since Catalunya in 1998, won the China Rally,
the 11th round of the world championship.
</P>
<P>
He was 55.8 seconds ahead of Richard Burns of Britain in a
Subaru. Auriol's Toyota teammate Carlos Sainz won third place with
1:23.6 further back.
</P>
<P>
"It has been more than one year for me without a victory,"
Auriol said. "I'm just waiting for my turn."
</P>
<P>
"My car is very nice to drive and the Michelin tire is good. I
really enjoy to go back to the victory.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I had fantastic drives but did not win. You need to
get fit into your car and in your mind, and you make good
victories," Auriol added.
</P>
<P>
Burns said, "Didier's time is not like he did in the first time
in the rally. He drove very incredibly well."
</P>
<P>
Finland's Juha Kankkunen was fourth in another Subaru, ahead of
his compatriot Harri Rovanpera driving a SEAT.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Volkan Isik became the first driver from that country
to ever score a world championship point when he took the sixth
place in a Toyota Corolla.
</P>
<P>
Suffering a mechanical failure, Oman's Hamed Al Wahaibi was the
only retired driver of the day with 42 of the 67 competitors not
finishing the 22-stage rally.
</P>
<P>
The victory awarded Auriol 10 points to share the first place
on the overall standings with Finn Tommi Makinen, who did not
finish because of damage in the suspension. Both now collected 48
points with three rounds yet to be run.
</P>
<P>
Sainz is next on 38 ahead of Kankkunen 37 and Burns 35.
</P>
<P>
"If Didier can do in a few stages as he did in this rally, it's
impossible (for me to catch up the drivers ahead of me)," Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
Toshihiro Arai, in a Subaru, easily won the Group N class by 8:
01.1 from Uruguay's Gustavo Trelles and Japanese Katsuhiko Taguchi,
but it is enough for Taguchi to wrap up the victory in the Asia-
Pacific Rally Championship.

<HEADLINE> Jurassic Dinosaur Fossil Remains Found in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have
unearthed bones of what could be the oldest Jurassic age dinosaur
fossil ever found in this country.
</P>
<P>
According to PTI, the dinosaur skeleton was found by a team of
scientists from the Regional Geology Laboratory of the
Bombay-based Oil and Natural Gas Commission in Kutch region of
India's western state of Gujarat.
</P>
<P>
This is the first occurrence of the oldest fossil dinosaur from
the earliest middle Jurassic era in Kutch.
</P>
<P>
More than 12 vertebrae and many other bone pieces were found,
some still embedded in the area's sandstone, and others scattered
over the outcrops covering an area of about 200 square meters. The
bones were 10-15 cm long and 9-10 cm broad.
</P>
<P>
A systematic excavation of the site is required by
professionals to reconstruct the full skeleton of what could be
possibly a middle Jurassic dinosaur.

<HEADLINE> China Holds National Tooth-Care Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua)-- The Ministry of Health of
China organized large-scale consultation and publicity activities
concerning oral health today in some big Chinese cities to mark
the 11th National Tooth-care Day.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing Ditan (Temple of the Earth) Park, experts from the
capital set up reception tables early in the morning and patiently
answered questions from thousands of city dwellers and handed out
some publicity materials.
</P>
<P>
This year's activity focused on the senior people, with the
theme of "A Happy Life for Elders Needs Oral Health", said Jin
Dapeng, vice-director of the Beijing Bureau of Health.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that dental problems are a major health
threat to the elderly in China.
</P>
<P>
Results of the survey show that very few old people see the
dentists. One fifth of the elderly have never seen the dentists in
their lifetime and less than 5 percent of them received dental
treatment in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Well over 60 percent of the aged take tooth-losing for granted,
regarding it as a natural thing, and one fifth of the senior
citizens think that the condition of tooth health is innate.
</P>
<P>
"We have to do more to promote the awareness of tooth health
and treatment, although we have done a lot and achieved
significant results in the past decade", said Jin.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Agriculture and
Fisheries Department of Hong Kong Sunday held a clean-up campaign
with divers from various organizations to remove fishing gear and
rubbish left on the seabed and coastal areas of marine parks and
marine reserve.
</P>
<P>
The exercise covered all three marine parks in Hong Kong as
well as Cape D'Aguilar Marine Reserve.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the campaign, Senior Marine Parks Officer Edward
Wong said: "Marine environment in these places will be much
improved with the removal of abandoned fishing gear. It also helps
prevent unnecessary damages to marine resources."
</P>
<P>
The refuse left on seabed, also known as the "ghost fishing
gear", might trap and kill marine life if not cleared regularly.
</P>
<P>
More than 110 divers from the Fire Services Department and
other diving organizations participated in the clean-up exercise.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's three marine parks and a marine reserve, covering
total sea areas of 2,160 hectares, were designated in 1996 for
long-term protection and improvement of the marine environment.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Not to Tolerate Corruption: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has vowed not to tolerate corruption and stressed that
everyone stands equal before the law, the local Egyptian Gazette
newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I stand along with the people in the battles against
corruption, deviation or collection of wealth illegally," Mubarak
said in an interview with the October weekly magazine on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that those involved in corruption cases surrender
themselves to the public prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is "a country of institutions. The integrity of the
Egyptian justice system is beyond question," said Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
A number of parliament members were referred recently to the
public prosecution for investigations on charges that they had
received money illegally from banks, dubbed "sweet loans" by the
local media.
</P>
<P>
In the interview published on Sunday, Mubarak dismissed as
rumors the claims about plans to privatize the four major national
banks.
</P>
<P>
The truth is that the stakes owned by the four banks in some
smaller banks will be offered for sale, the president said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that Egypt may, at a certain time, consider
offering part of one of the major banks in the form of shares to
increase its capital.
</P>
<P>
Egypt kicked off the privatization process in 1995 and has so
far sold part or whole of more than one third of the 314
state-owned enterprises chosen for the process. The government is
cautious about the privatization of national banks to avert
possible financial turmoil witnessed in Southeastern Asian
countries in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader said he is assessing the fulfillment
achieved in the past years and working on a comprehensive action
plan for the period ahead.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak became Egypt's president in 1981 and was re-elected in
1987 and 1993. He has been nominated by the parliament for a
fourth six-year term and is set to win the September 26 referendum
to endorse the nomination.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Mossad Trys to Avoid Swiss Trial on Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Ministry of
Justice and intelligence organization Mossad are trying to save a
Mossad agent from being tried in Switzerland, the local daily
Ha'aretz reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are being made to prevent the Mossad agent, identified
as Y, from being forced to appear at his trial in Bern, for fear
that his life would be endangered if he is photographed or seen
during the proceedings, the daily quoted Ministry and Mossad
sources as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Y faces charges of political espionage, attempted
eavesdropping and taping of conversations and using false
documents.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested by Swiss police on February 19 in Bern while
trying to set up eavesdropping equipment in the apartment building
of a Hezbollah activist.
</P>
<P>
He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
The charge sheets said Y confessed that he had worked for
Mossad and used false identity documents several times to enter
and leave Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Four other Mossad agents, two men and two women, were also
arrested but they managed to wrangle their way out of Swiss jail
and escape police.
</P>
<P>
The four, whose identities were not known to the Swiss police,
will not be charged.
</P>
<P>
Israel signed a letter of guarantee for 3 million U.S. dollars,
promising that Y will appear in court whenever he is summoned. As
a result, the Swiss police freed Y and returned him to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that if the Swiss insist Y appear in court,
they hope the trial will be conducted behind closed doors and
that his identity will not be revealed.

BAGHDAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Sunday denied claims
that its soldiers opened fire at two Kuwaiti policemen, saying it
is ready to cooperate with the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait
Observation Mission (UNIKOM) to reveal the truth.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed political editor of the Iraqi News Agency stressed
in a statement that the incident occurred "inside the Kuwaiti
territories and the Iraqi side has nothing to do with it."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi side is not concerned with such matter and the Iraqi
authorities are ready to cooperate with UNIKOM for investigation
into the incident, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
On September 17, UNIKOM told the Iraqi side that it had
received reports from the Kuwaiti side that two Kuwaiti policemen
were shot dead near the border pillar 73 inside the Kuwait
territories a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Neither the Kuwaiti side nor UNIKOM has presented a complaint
against the Iraqi side so far.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi side also informed UNIKOM office that the incident
had taken place on the Kuwait side and cleared itself of any links
to the matter.
</P>
<P>
UNIKOM was set up following the 1991 Gulf War and entrusted
with the mission of observing the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border
areas.

<P>
NAIROBI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan and Ugandan
authorities have resolved to exchange and share intelligence
information to curb cattle rustling and illegal firearm menace
along their common border.
</P>
<P>
At a border security meeting closed Saturday in Kitale, Kenya's
Western Province, over 100 participants resolved to pursue joint

Kenyan media often reported such cases as armed cattle
rustling, drug trafficking and illegal trade in weapons along the
Kenya-Uganda common border.
</P>

At the meeting, Provincial Commissioner of Kenya's Rift Valley,

of firearms, citing the outlets including war-torn countries like

JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat met secretly last week in an
effort to set up high-level back-channel talks in parallel with
the final-status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Dahlan, head of the Palestinian Preventive Security

He also said that the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state is the "sanctified rights" of the Palestinian
people that are no open for negotiations.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz left here for New York Sunday to attend the 54th U.N.
General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
Aziz is planned to address the U.N. General Assembly session
focusing on the nuclear and Kashmir issues.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told the media before his departure the international
community realized particularly after the Kargil crisis that
Indo-Pak relations could not be normalized without the resolution
of the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
The world now, he said, is cognizance of the fact that tension
between the two South Asia nations was not in the interest of
international peace.
</P>
<P>
Unless the Kashmiris are given their right to
self-determination, Kashmir issue cannot be resolved, said the
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in New York, Aziz is expected to hold talks
with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Pak-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
Aziz will also use the opportunity to meet his counterparts
from some other countries and brief them on the regional situation
besides discussing bilateral relations with them, official sources
said.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian High-Tech and Economic Zone Runs Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The high-tech and economic zone
jointly run by China and Russia is going on well in Yantai, a
coast city in east China's Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
So far, it is the only demonstration zone which was established
in December 1998 to promote technological and economic exchanges
between the two countries. The cooperation will focus on
development of new materials, biological pharmacy, fine chemistry,
and electronics.
</P>
<P>
Construction work has already begun in the 100,000 sq. meters
industry area, 30,000 sq. meters research center and 80,000 sq.
meters residential quarters.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Science and Technology show
that China has imported about 1,000 high-tech projects from Russia
in the past 5 years, though exchange of technology still remained
a small portion in the total bilateral trade worth 5.5 billion U.S.
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The development of the zone also indicates a bright future of
the trade and cooperation between China and Russia, according to
the ministry sources.

<HEADLINE> China Rally, New Rough Experience to World Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUAIROU, Beijing, September 19 (Xinhua) -- With only 25 drivers
completing the overall 22 stages, the China Rally lived up to its
reputation as the toughest round of the World Rally Championship.
</P>
<P>
World leader Finn Tommi Makinen led a 42-member retiring field
in the three-day rally, which covered 1,423 kilometers with a
total of 385 competitive kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the top drivers had no knowledge of the rally, which
was included in the world championship for the first time in its
third version, and experience did not count for much.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Didier Auriol drove his Toyota Corolla to a great win
in his first racing spell in China, while his teammate Spaniard
Carlos Sainz finished third as the reserved Toyota proved the
biggest winner in China.
</P>
<P>
Subaru, the manufacturer who had competed in the Hong Kong-
Beijing adventure rally, had its two top drivers in good positions
with Richard Burns of Britain on second and Juha Kankkunen of
Finland at fourth.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain before the start of the race created difficult
conditions on the very first day of the rally, causing the
cancellation of two stages.
</P>
<P>
The slippery, mud-covered and rock-strewn roads took their toll
on four of the manufacturers nominated crews on the opening day,
including two-time winner here Colin McRae of Scotland and Thomas
Radstrom of Sweden, both in Ford team.
</P>
<P>
The second day saw off over half of the drivers when the battle
at the top of the leaderboard was extremely intense.
</P>
<P>
Makinen charged into the first place he had lost to overnight
leader Burns with four fasters times of the day's eight stages,
only to retire after hitting a rock and damaging the front
suspension of his Mitsubishi on stage 16.
</P>
<P>
The wet weather conditions, which had made the rally so
treacherous, finally moved away on the third day to allow the
route to dry out a little with Auriol conquering five out of the
final six stages to post a almost one-minute leading margin over
second Burns to his triumph.
</P>
<P>
The world championship is to continue its prestigious tour to
San Remo Rally in Italy on October 3-6 with Auriol and Makinen co-
leading the field with 48 points in the drivers championship and
Toyota dominating the manufacturers race.

<HEADLINE> Israel: First Redeployment in Full </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua)-- Israel has said that its
first troop redeployment in the West Bank under the new peace deal
was in full and the Palestinian accusation in this regard was not
justified.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, Local Government Minister of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), said Saturday the Palestinians had
received only 6.5 percent of the West Bank land and PNA will
protest to the Israeli side over this matter.
</P>
<P>
In response to the Palestinian accusation, the Prime
Minister's Office issued a statement Saturday night saying that
the Palestinians had received the full 7 percent of the West Bank
land, as set out in the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, who is in charge of the interim phase talks with the
Israelis, said that during Israel's first redeployment last
weekend, three separate parts in the West Bank had not been
transferred to the Palestinian side. One of them is situated west
of the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
"We handed the redeployment maps over to them (palestinian
side) prior to the land transfer, and Chairman Arafat approved
them after studying them carefully. And now they said were not
enough and how could you believe that was true," a senior official
at the Prime Minister's Office told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace deal signed by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and PNA Chairman Arafat in Egypt earlier this month, Israel
has to carry out another two land transfers in November and next
January.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the two sides have to reach a framework agreement
on the final-status talks by February and a final peace accord
by next September.
</P>
<P>
The two sides launched their final-status talks on Monday
while Barak and Arafat met secretly Friday to discuss generally
the negotiations for a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
Both sides called this secret meeting "a positive discussion
in a good atmosphere in preparation for the final settlement
negotiations."

CANBERRA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Tibet is better off than
that under the medieval, feudal administration of the Dalai Lama,
Deputy Speaker Garry Nehl of the House of Representatives of
Australia Sunday said after a visit to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Nehl said the progress made in Tibet since his last visit seven
years ago was astonishing.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that he had visited Lhasa and some other
towns, all of which have large numbers of new buildings including
schools and department stores.
</P>
<P>
Nehl, who is preparing a report on his visit to Tibet for
parliament, said he had also been impressed by a constant stream
of traffic, including buses and commercial trucks.
</P>
<P>
"In 1992, the only public transport in Lhasa consisted of a few
bicycle rickshaws and now there are large numbers of taxis," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is obviously growing at a very fast rate with dozens
of tourist buses filling the streets," he added. "Increased
commercial activity is also obvious."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nehl said he "did not see any road blocks, check
points or any other sign of restrictions on freedom of movement."
</P>
<P>
"Equally, there were no restrictions on people entering
monasteries or temples," he said.

HUAIROU, Beijing, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Didier

he conquered the final day of the 11th round of the World Rally
Championship on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Auriol, driving a Toyota Corolla, was awarded 10 points on the

The Frenchman never had his crown challenged by the closest
rival Richard Burns of Britain in a Subaru in the day when he won
five of the final six stages.
</P>
<P>
"The road is drier," Auriol said when he reached the stop spot
of the final stage in Wu Ying Zi. "China Rally is a good and hard
rally."

Burns took the other one to finish second, 55.8 seconds behind
the leader, while Spaniard Carlos Sainz, also in a Toyota, was
third with Subaru's Juha Kankkunen of Finland at fourth.

<HEADLINE> Strong Yen Boosts Philippines' Costume Jewelry Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A strong Japanese yen boosted
the Philippines' exports of costume jewelry in the first semester
of this year, which registered a 132 percent increase as against
that of a year ago, a report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here, the Philippine Costume Jewelry
Center said that the country's jewelry exports in the first half
of the year rose by 132 percent to 15.6 million U.S. dollars,
compared to 7.7 million dollars in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the sharp surge in the country's costume
jewelry exports to a stronger Japanese yen this year, since a
strong yen makes Japanese exports more expensive in the world
market and its imports cheaper.
</P>
<P>
As of Friday, the Japanese yen was quoted at 106.73 to the
dollar on the world foreign exchange market, the highest in the
past three years.
</P>
<P>
The report said that because of the strong yen, Japan's imports
of Philippine costume jewelry amounted to 4.3 million dollars in
the first six months of the year as against 976,000 dollars for
the period last year.
</P>
<P>
The total exports of Philippine costume jewelry this year is
expected to hit 20 million dollars, or a 25 percent rise over last
years, it said.

<HEADLINE> 80% of Zambia's External Debt May Be Cancelled: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has said that
up to 80 percent of Zambia's external debt could be cancelled by
the donor community because of the country's assistance to
neighboring countries struggling for peace.
</P>
<P>
"As much as 80 percent of that (external debt) can be
potentially written off," World Bank representative Lawrence
Clarke said in Lusaka lately.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the wish of the bank and other creditors to help
the Zambian government in this way because Lusaka's peace efforts
in the neighboring countries have contributed to the incurring of
the external debt.
</P>
<P>
"The number is not significant, but what is significant is that
there is no way Zambia can repay the debt," the Sunday Mail
newspaper quoted Clarke as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the bank cautioned that the Zambian government should
ensure that the money was ploughed back into the economy for the
benefit of the poor people.
</P>
<P>
Clarke noted that before cancellation could be implemented, the
donors wanted Zambia to make a commitment to do away with
subsidies and that the funds would be used in social sector to
alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
"It is fundamental that before the debt is cancelled, the
government makes it clear on how the funds can be spent," Clarke
said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official gave an example of the Uganda situation
where the government formed structures to ensure that the funds
cancelled from debt servicing were ploughed back into the economic
sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Pauline Krikke, vice-mayor of
Amsterdam, capital city of the Netherlands, has recently led a
delegation to north China's Tianjin Municipality, holding a forum
on investment with the theme "Amsterdam-A Wise Choice", to inspire
more Chinese companies in strengthening cooperation and exchange
with the country.
</P>
<P>
Amsterdam, a transportation center and also a financial center
in Europe, is a gateway for foreign companies to enter the
Netherlands and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Krikke said that trade and economic cooperation between China
and the Netherlands has seen rapid growth in the last few years.
And over 40 state-owned enterprises and many private companies in
China have expanded their business in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands has tried to intensify mutual understanding and
economic cooperation of the two sides by sending a delegation
composed of businessmen led by the Dutch Minister of Foreign Trade
at the beginning of this year to visit Beijing, Tianjin, and
Hangzhou. Moreover, the visit of the Dutch Queen this April has
also pushed further development of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the trade volume between the two countries
last year reached as much as 6 billion U.S. dollars, with the
Netherlands becoming the second largest importer of China in the
European Union. And the Netherlands' investment in China
accumulated to 1.6 billion U.S. dollars by the end of last year.

WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Undefeated Vassily Jirov
of Kazakhstan retained his IBF cruiserweight title with a 10th-
round technical knockout of Canada's Dale Brown on the Undercard
of the Oscar de la Hoya-Felix Trinidad title unification showdown
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Jirov and Brown started tactically with neither fighter seizing
an advantage. Jirov repeatedly pressed the action but was unable
to penetrate the guard of Brown, who looked to land counterpunches
</P>
<P>
The bout began to heat up in the fifth round as Jirov applied
pressure to Brown along the ropes. Brown tried to fight back and
engage in a slugfest, but was floored by a clubbing right in the
final seconds.
</P>
<P>
Jirov stayed on the attack in the sixth and seventh, piling up
a sizable lead. Brown found some offense in the eighth, stunning
the champion midway through the round. But in the closing second
of the 10th, Jirov landed a crippling left hook to the body that
sent the challenger to the canvas.
</P>
<P>
Referee Richard Steele began counting over the fallen Brown
before waving the fight over with eight seconds remaining in the
round.
</P>
<P>
In four-round sideshows against carefully selected opposition,
super heavyweight Eric Esch and Mia St. John were victorious.
</P>
<P>
After being outboxed in the opening round, Butterbean posted a
second-round stoppage of an overmatched Ken Craven.

Meanwhile, St. John dropped Kelley Downey in the opening
seconds of third round and continued the one-sided onslaught
before the referee stopped it with 20 seconds left in the fourth.

Undefeated super flyweight prospect Eric Morel posted a dull
unanimous decision over journeyman Miguel Angel Granados of Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Strives for Balanced Development in National Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Industry in northeast China
's Jilin Province, a main crop production base in the nation, has
witnessed speedy development in the past few years, according to a
ranking provincial official.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Wang Yunkun, secretary of the
Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said
the province has set up a multilevel industrial structure with hi-
tech industrial sectors as the foundation, automobile and petro-
chemical industries as the pillars, and grain production,
pharmaceuticals, and electronics as other important staples.
</P>
<P>
Jilin's industrial output value in 1998 was 170.8 billion yuan
(20.5 billion U.S. dollars) -- 310 times the amount of 1949, when
New China was founded. Its gross domestic product was 28-fold that
of 1952.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 2,700 scientific projects have won national awards,
and the province has been a leader in the fields of biological
engineering, transportation machinery, software, and polymer
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
In addition to agriculture, the province has also worked to
develop fishery, animal husbandry, forestry, and township level
enterprises, which have helped to reduce the surplus labor force
in the rural area, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The multilevel development has increased the average disposable
income per capita to 4,207 yuan in the urban area, and 2,384 yuan
for the rural people, 8.3 times and 4.2 times over 1983.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province's farmland makes up one-25th
of the country's total, while its grain yield accounts for one-
tenth, its grain reserve one-fifth, and maize exports half of the
nation's total.
</P>
<P>
And it has ranked first for ten consecutive years in per capita
grain share, commodity rate of grains, and maize exports.
</P>
<P>
"We will stick to inspiring the economic development with high
and advanced science and technology as well as education, and we
will increase allocations in education, compulsory education in
particular, so as to reform the outdated part of the present
educational structure," Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Bangla Enclave Issues May Not Be Solved Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The long-standing problem with
regard to the enclaves in both Bangladesh and India is not
expected to end soon as it involves a very complicated procedure,
according to local legal experts.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional lawyers say that the settlement of the enclave
issue, first of all, needs amendments to the constitutions of the
two countries by a two-thirds majority. But it appears that in the
prevailing circumstances, neither Bangladesh nor India will be in
a position to bring amendments to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The government in Bangladesh is a government by a simple
majority, while India continues witnessing coalition government
with diverse ideologies of the components.
</P>
<P>
Unless a consensus is built up in both the countries by
lawmakers on the issue, it will be impossible to solve this
nagging problem, whatever be the number of official talks or
discussions at the highest political level, legal experts pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
According to Bangladeshi newspapers, there are 72 Bangladeshi
enclaves in Indian territory and 119 Indian enclaves in
Bangladeshi territory. On the other hand, Indian newspapers say
the number of Bangladeshi enclaves in India is 95 and Indian
enclaves in Bangladesh is 103. Total population of these enclaves
together is around 400,000 (200,000 in Bangladeshi enclaves and
200,000 in Indian enclaves).
</P>
<P>
The issue of exchange or handover of the enclaves to the mother
country were discussed several times at the highest political
level of the two countries during the last 50 years. but nothing
happened.

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures on China's Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: The People's Republic of China celebrates its
50th founding anniversary this year and Xinhua will release 10
stories on key facts and figures on the nation's economic and
social development over the last half century. This is the fifth.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- China's family planning
policy since the late 1970s has successfully prevented the
excessive growth of China's population, while the overall quality
of its people has been improving since the founding of the People'
s Republic of China in 1949. The following is a group of facts and
figures on China's population.
</P>
<P>
China's population was 500 million in 1949, one billion in 1980,
and 1.248 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China's birth rate was 16 per thousand, natural growth
rate 9.5 per thousand, while the fertility rate of the Chinese
women was 1.8. By the standard of the United Nations, China is
among countries with the lowest fertility rate.
</P>
<P>
In the 30 years before China adopted the family planning policy,
the average annual growth rate of China's population was 30 per
thousand, while the fertility rate of the Chinese women was an
average of six.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that China's family planning policy has saved
it from having a population of 300 million, and has postponed the
day the world population hits six billion by three years.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the mortality rate of the Chinese population was 6.5
per thousand, while its infant mortality rate was 33 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
From 1949 to 1998, the average life expectancy of the Chinese
rose from 35 to 71, which is 10 years higher than the average
level for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
China now has more old people. In 1998, it had 80 million
people aged 65 or above, accounting for seven percent of the total
population.
</P>
<P>
In 1953, China's minority ethnic groups had a total population
of 35 million, accounting for six percent of the nation's total
number. In 1998, the two figures had increased to 110 million and
nearly nine percent.
</P>
<P>
China's population is now growing by 12 million a year.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that China's population will start to decrease
by the middle of the 21st century, when the population will reach
its peak at 1.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> SOE Reform Offers Overseas Investors New Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investors will find
more business opportunities in China's reform of State-owned
enterprises (SOE), the China Daily's Business Weekly reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The strategic reshuffle of State-owned assets during the
reform will lead to transfers of State assets, and overseas
investors will discover new opportunities in all sectors, whether
they have increased or reduced State involvement," the paper
quoted Ma Yu, a senior researcher from the Chinese Academy of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, as saying.
</P>
<P>
State-owned industrial assets now values 7 trillion yuan (843
billion US dollars), the paper said. Some local governments have
already drawn up policies to encourage foreign investors to
cooperate with small and medium-sized SOEs via shareholding,
mergers, acquisitions and technical collaboration.
</P>
<P>
Overseas companies think highly of the solid industrial
foundation and the many efficient and responsible managers and
technicians in China's SOEs, said Gao Guozhu, vice-governor of
Liaoning Province, where cooperation between overseas companies
and SOEs has been successful.
</P>
<P>
Ma stressed China has a multitude of opportunities for overseas
investors despite the current lull in investment.

<HEADLINE> Poland, Germany, Denmark Set up Joint Force Under NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Poland, Germany and Denmark
officially set up a tri-national force under NATO's command in
Poland's key northwestern port of Szczecin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Polish Press Agency reported that the defense ministers and
chiefs of staff of armed forces from the three countries on
Saturday signed related documents on the formation of the force,
which is the northeastern multinational army group under the
military alliance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Establishment of such a force after Poland's accession into
NATO was decided in 1997. In September 1998, the defense chiefs of
the three countries chose Szczecin as the base of the troops,
which, in the words of Polish Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz,
will become NATO's rapid reaction units in the future.
</P>
<P>
Polish press reports said the army group consists of a Danish
mechanized division, Germany's 14th mechanized infantry division
and Poland's 12th mechanized division in Szczecin.
</P>
<P>
Each of the three units will stay in its own country with 150
officers working at the headquarters in Szczecin. The army group's
chief is Henrik Ekmann from Denmark, with Edward Pietrzyk from
Poland as his deputy and Hans Joachim Sachau from Germany as the
chief of staff.

<P>
People should be aware of the fact that although the social
tumor of Falun Gong has been removed, viruses have not been fully
destroyed and are still attacking society, it says.
</P>
<P>
-- The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and
the Ministry of Water Resources urged people, in a circular issued

the success of autumn sowing.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Sector to Lower Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Bowing to consumer's ever-
louder complaints about high charges, the telecommunications
administration is set to initiate another package of price cuts
for Internet access and phone communications later this year.
</P>
<P>
Today's Business Weekly says that though Zhang Cunjiang,
director general of the Telecommunications Administration Bureau,
did not venture any details, he indicated Internet fees will be
cut significantly from the present level, four yuan (0.48 U.S.
dollars) per hour.
</P>
<P>
The price reduction in March in the telecom sector immediately
resulted in a consumption spree in the telecom sector, with the
number of fixed-line users soared by 14.06 million to over 100
million in the first eight months, and that of Internet users from
2.1 million at the end of last year to 4 million by June.
</P>
<P>
However, the statistics from the Ministry of Information
Industry show that the telecom revenue will be reduced by some 8
billion yuan this year due to the readjustments.
</P>
<P>
While, the ministry has up to now not met the demands of
consumers who were hoping that the phone installation fee and the
two-way charge system for cellular phones would be abolished.
</P>
<P>
"Telecom service charges must be slashed so consumers can
benefit from the application of advanced technologies and products,
" said an expert from the China Academy of Telecommunications
Technology.
</P>
<P>
The telecom sector's current charge structure for mobile phones
is under pressure from customers and the country's two telecom
operators, China Telecom and China Unicom.
</P>
<P>
And in order to expand market share and attract new customers,
the two have breached the government-set price limits in local
markets by lowering network access and phone call charges
significantly, said an official with the Price Control Department
of the State Development Planning Commission.

<HEADLINE> Third Telecom Operator Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- China's third government-
backed telecom operator, the China Netcom Corp (CNC) is to be set
up in the middle of next month to complement established China
Telecom and China Unicom, said Today's Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Edward Tian, CNC chief executive officer, said the four
investors of the company the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the
State Administration of Radio, Films, and Television, the Ministry
of Railways, and Shanghai municipal government will each hold 25
percent of the stake, with the registered capital being 120
million yuan (14.46 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The company will mainly deal in two businesses, the Internet
Protocol (IP) backbone services, and international integrated data
service targeted at multinationals and large businesses in China.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that they plan to establish one of the world's
fastest optical fiber networks covering 15 Chinese cities. And the
network, which is to offer an IP backbone network service in the
third quarter of next year, will be the world's first IP-based
optical fiber commercial network with a bandwidth of 20 gigabits-
the largest to date in the world.
</P>
<P>
CNC's first step after its establishment will be to sell IP
phone cards. CNC will provide network access and carrier-to-
carrier services for China's Internet service providers and large
companies, Tian said, adding that they are a backbone wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences, in a report submitted to the
State Council, said "The world's Internet traffic has been
doubling every six months in the past few years and is expected
to surpass voice communications next year. Many new technologies
and applications, including IP technology, are posing a great
challenge to the traditional telecommunications industry."
</P>
<P>
While many compare CNC with the two existing telecom companies,
and nickname it as "China Telecom III", Tian debated that "We are
not the third. The two expect to be present in many, if not all,
areas. But we are a very focused company; our core competence is
based on IP technology and the IP-based backbone."
</P>
<P>
And another big difference is that the CNC operates more like a
market-oriented firm.

</P>
<P>

before the summit.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Puts Forward Conditions for Talk with Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana demanded Saturday that the country's second
biggest rebel group release 39 kidnapped civilians as a condition
to start peace talks.
</P>
<P>
President Pastrana made the demand after the National
Liberation Army (ELN) said Friday that it hoped to resume direct
peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
Contacts between the government and the ELN broke off after the
rebel group staged two mass kidnappings involving a commercial
airliner and a church congregation in April and May.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the Pastrana government and the country's biggest
rebel group -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) --
started in early May but were suspended in mid July after the
guerrilla group rejected the sending of international observers to
the demilitarization zone in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Pastrana is scheduled to present to the U.N. General
Assembly the "Plan Colombia" that includes the country's peace
process, economic recovery, and restructuring of the armed forces.
The plan is estimated to cost some 7.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The death toll of Colombia's long civil war has exceeded 35,000
in the last decade, as guerrillas, right-wing death squads and the
U.S.-trained army battled for control of the land.

<P>
CARACAS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez and his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton will meet next
Tuesday in New York, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente
Rangel said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The presidents will meet at the UN headquarters when they
attend the 54th UN General Assembly, Rangel told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting, the second since Chavez assumed his post on
February 2, the two presidents will exchange views on the
Colombian civil conflict, Venezuelan constitutional process and
cooperation in anti-drug war.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Chavez will travel to Washington to meet with
congressmen, businessmen and the board of directors of The
Washington Post on the background that the U.S. government
criticized him for his refusal to permit U.S. aircraft to overfly
Venezuelan territory in anti-drug missions.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president will explain what he calls his "
democratic and peaceful revolution" on the matter, said Rangel.
</P>
<P>
Chavez will also meet with officials from the International
Monetary Fund, World Bank, and Interamerican Development Bank.

<HEADLINE> Chile Reports First Trade Deficit of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Chile registered 109.7
million U.S. dollars in negative balance of foreign trade in
August, its first monthly deficit this year, according to
statistics released by the Central Bank on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Imports of the month reached 1.275 billion dollars and exports
1.165 billion dollars, the statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
However, experts here said the August deficit is one of the
first concrete signals of economic recovery and spending increase
in Chile although it is still lagging behind Brazil, where the
economy inched out of recession in the second quarter with 0.9
percent growth.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the Chilean economy will start growing
again this month, and the Central Bank expects the country to post
a 5-percent growth in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted experts as saying that the rebound of copper
prices bodes well for Chile -- the world's largest copper producer
and exporter.
</P>
<P>
Copper accounts for about 40 percent of Chilean exports.
</P>
<P>
Copper prices on the international market increased by 2
percent on Friday to their highest level in 16 months.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebel Group Denies Kidnapping Foreigners in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) has denied kidnapping 12 foreigners in
Ecuador's northern area bordering Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The FARC is making its own investigations into the case, a
spokesman of the rebel group told the Ecuadorian newspaper "Hoy"
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified armed men kidnapped an American, seven Canadians,
three Spaniards and a Belgian a week ago in an area between the
Ecuadorian cities Lago Agrio and Terapoa, near the border with
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Colombian governments blamed the kidnapping on the
FARC.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorian army troops and police are still searching for the
hostages, whose whereabouts remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
Three U.S. missionaries were killed early this year in
Venezuela's border area with Colombia, for which the Colombian
authorities also blamed on the FARC.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Talks About China's Achievements At Pacific Economic Cooperation Council Seminar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- China's economy is growing
fast and has great potential to develop further, according to
Zhang Xiaoqiang, the head of the foreign investment department of
the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told a seminar here at the 1st International Trade and
Investment Fair of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC)
that China has achieved a lot in economic development since it
began its reforms and opening up in the late 1970s and that
foreign trade increased from 20.6 billion U.S. dollars worth in
1979 to 320 billion U.S. dollars worth in 1998, growing 15 percent
on average annually and putting China in No. 11 place in world
trade.
</P>
<P>
With its fast transportation, telecommunications, energy, and
hydro-electric power development, China has great possibilities of
maintaining a healthy and fast economy, but China still lags
behind many industrialized countries in many aspects, he said.
Telephone ownership is a mere 10 percent, per capita electricity
consumption is just a third of the world's average, and over 300
cities have water supply problems.
</P>
<P>
China's long-term policy is one of continuing the opening-up
policy to draw foreign investment, he said. By the end of July,
China has approved 334,000 foreign-funded enterprises with
contractual investments worth 595 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
PECC was established in Australia in September 1980 and now has
23 member states providing consultation and negotiations on
economic cooperation and development in the Pacific region. China
became a member of the council in September 1986.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana will present to the U.N. General Assembly his Plan
Colombia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes strategies for the country's peace process,
economic recovery, job creation, restructuring of the armed forces,
and the war against organized crimes and corruption.
</P>
<P>
It also covers proposals on how to improve justice, increase
social participation and protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana described the package, involving a total cost of 7.5
billion U.S. dollars, as the Colombian Plan for Peace, Prosperity
and the Strengthening of the State.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government will allocate 4 billion dollars to the
implementation of the plan, and the other 3.5 billion dollars are
expected to come from the outside.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has been wrenched by a four decade long civil war and
is facing the worst economic slump in its history.

<P>
BRASILIA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A nation-wide campaign of
vaccinating against rabies was initiated in Brazil on Friday
during which 18 million dogs and cats will be vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
The organizer, the Brazilian Health Ministry, said the campaign
will cost 3.6 U.S. million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that 500 cases of animal rabies have been
reported this year throughout the country, and 18 Brazilians died
of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 1,746 such cases were reported and 28 people died of
it.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to vaccinate the animals every year, because
they are the main source of transmission of this disease to man,"
the ministry said in a report.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Calls for Players' Salary Cap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson has called for a cap on players' wages to stop salaries
spiraling out of control, according to local reports on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Treble winners boss is alarmed by the huge increases in
wages over the last few years and some of the Premiership's top
earners are taking home in excess of 40,000 pounds a week.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson believes the top players should earn the top wages,
but he feels there should be some sort of limit.
</P>
<P>
"We're living in an era of football where some of the salaries
are crazy and it does worry me," he said in the official
Manchester United magazine.
</P>
<P>
"But we just have to try and do our best and we've been
successful with what we try to do.
</P>
<P>
"I'm all for progress and I believe top players should be given
top wages, but I also believe there has to be a system of wage-
capping before things get too far out of control."
</P>
<P>
United have been criticized for operating a salary ceiling at
Old Trafford and it is believed top earners like Mark Bosnich take
home around 30,000 pounds a week.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson clearly feels such a wages structure is the way
forward, which is interesting given skipper Roy Keane's refusal to
sign a new contract with the Treble winners, reportedly because
the club would not meet his financial demands.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson also appears to be contradicting himself. In his
autobiography, Managing My Life, he claimed the club's wages
ceiling prevented him signing some of the world's best players and
conquering Europe sooner.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The arrival of an Atlantic storm
front has brought heavy rains to northwest and southwest Italy
with flooding and strong winds causing considerable damage.
</P>
<P>
The tail of a previous storm system leaving Italy to the
southeast brought considerable rainfall to the region of Puglia,
especially the Taranto area where flooding interrupted some road
communications and isolated several communities. Damage was also
reported to vineyards and fruit groves.
</P>
<P>
The rain in Italy's northwest city of Milan flooded apartments,
garages and underpasses with police reporting a high number of
automobile accidents.
</P>
<P>
In northwest region of Piedmont, violent storms caused flooding
and brought down trees especially in the provinces of Vercelli and
Alessandria.
</P>
<P>
Lightning struck an electrical transformer for the Milan-Turin
rail line blocking a freight train but causing no serious damage
or injury. Rail traffic, however, was reduced to only one track to
serve both directions.

<HEADLINE> Pierpoint Plans to End Turmoil of Leicester Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Leicester football club chief
executive Barrie Pierpoint is ready to hold talks with Martin O'
Neill in a bid to end the turmoil that is tearing the club apart.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill and Pierpoint are long-standing adversaries, with the
recent episode involving the alleged resignations of club chairman
John Elsom and Plc chief Sir Rodney Walker - both allies of the
Foxes manager - deepening the divide.
</P>
<P>
Now, though, Pierpoint is keen to meet the former Northern
Ireland international - who vowed Friday to stay at Filbert Street
-and sort out any differences between the duo.
</P>
<P>
Pierpoint said: "If there are any problems, I'd like to know
what they are because I don't know what his problems are at the
moment. We need to sit down, have discussions and find a way
forward.
</P>
<P>
"Martin O'Neill has got my full support and backing. He runs
his operation the way he wants to and he'll get full co-operation
from me.
</P>
<P>
"I keep hearing that I'm meddling in football matters and
upsetting Martin. He hasn't indicated to me how or in what way I'm
making his job difficult.
</P>
<P>
"I have no remit to get involved in football matters. Martin O'
Neill is the person responsible for that and I don't wish to
interfere.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned we work well together when we need to
and that's in the best interests of the club and team," he said.

<HEADLINE>   Cycling Sport Shocked by New Drug Cheats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The specter of doping returned
to the sport of cycling again when three riders were thrown out of
races in France and Italy for failing blood tests.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's Marc Streel was prevented from starting the Grand
Prix des Nations at Forges-les-Eaux in western France, while Two
Italian riders, Fulvio Frigo and Giacomo Cariulo, were similarly
prevented from competing in the Tour of Latium in Italy after they,
too, returned blood readings above the safety limit.
</P>
<P>
A high count suggests the use of Erythropoietin (EPO), which
boosts the number of red blood cells which carry oxygen around the
body, and markedly improves endurance. Failing a test does not,
however prove EPO use.
</P>
<P>
Former Tour de France and Tour of Italy champion Marco Pantani
was a high-profile victim of the blood-testing regulations in July
when he was thrown out of the Tour of Italy for showing a red
corpuscle count of 52 percent.

While the Zambian government together with the United Nations,

direction, Tembo said.

 accredited to Zambia that with the recent peace agreement signed
by parties involved in the conflict, Zambia hopes that peace and
stability would return to the war-torn country.

He said the leadership of various partie-g2s can not
afford.
</P>
<P>
Bes the misery experienced by refuMand other displaced
persons as a result of destabilization is something African
governments can not handle and thereby have to ask the
international community for assistance, he said.
