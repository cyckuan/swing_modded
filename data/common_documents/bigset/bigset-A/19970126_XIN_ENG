<HEADLINE> 10 Tons of Hashish Seized in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 10 tons of charas
and 450 grams of heroin were seized by Pakistani customs in the
country's southern port city of Karachi today.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the customs intelligence had received
information that a syndicate of smugglers operating in the up
country was engaged in smuggling charas and heroin powder.
</P>
<P>
Director of Karachi's Directorate General of Customs
Intelligence and Investigation Mir Fuad formed a team to unearth
the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
The team had kept the suspects under surveillance before
eventually raiding the dumping place near Karachi Airport and
recovering 10,040 kilograms of charas of foreign origin and 450
grams of heroin.
</P>
<P>
It was one of the biggest seizure of drugs in the country,
according to the customs.
</P>
<P>
It appears that the drugs were to be smuggled abroad,
directorate sources said.
</P>
<P>
During preliminary investigations, one suspect under arrest
disclosed that his brother was actively involved in the smuggling
of charas from the up country and onward out of Pakistan through
his associates.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are being made to arrest the others involved in the
smuggling and further investigation is under way.

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan Peace Conference Opens in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Afghanistan Peace
Conference opened here this afternoon with the participation of
all Afghan groups except the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a press
conference on the sideline of the two-day conference that the
Taliban lost an opportunity for peace talks with various
factions in the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the purpose of the conference is to ask all
Afghan groups to sit down at the negotiation table and find out
the peaceful solution rather than military solution to the crisis
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran will continue its "humanitarian aid" to Afghanistan,
Velayati said, but he denied any military assistance.
</P>
<P>
He called on some countries in the region to stop any shipment
of arms and military equipment to the Taliban while condemning
foreign intervention in Afghanistan. But, he did not specify
which country is supporting the Taliban militarily.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the peace conference could hardly
achieve any concrete results without the participation of the
Taliban which has already controlled three quarters of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Attending the conference are ousted Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani and Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the
National Liberation Front leader Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, the
Unity Party leader Mohammad Akbari, the Islamic Movement leader
Asef Mohseni, the Islamic Party deputy leader Din Mohammad, and
Mansour Naderi, a representative to General Dostam.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting as observers are Boris Sheikh
Moradov, Turkmen Vice-President and Foreign Minister, Iftikhar
Morshed, Additional Secretary of the Pakistani Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, and Bilgia Can Korel, Turkish charge d'affaires
in Kabul and special envoy of Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
United Nations envoy for Afghan affairs Norbert Holl welcomed
the peace talks in Tehran. But he said that the meeting without
full participation of Afghan groups could hardly achieve
fruitful results for the settlement of the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the recent outbreak of hostility in the
Afghanistan, noting "the hostility could endanger the confidence
being built among different groups in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the peace and negotiation should be the only
way for the settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ousted Afghan president Rabbani said at the meeting that the
foreign intervention in Afghanistan is the main factor to the war
in Afghanistan. But he stressed no country can impose its will
upon Afghanistan even temporarily.
</P>
<P>
He said that all groups participating the peace conference
want to end the war and hostility and solve the problem through
peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Hekmayar said at the meeting that the Afghan crisis can be
solved if the foreign intervention is stopped.
</P>
<P>
He said that all political groups are important players in
Afghanistan in political and military terms. "We have to reach
an agreement and establish a coalition government. The future
government should be elected at the will of the people."
</P>
<P>
Former Afghan president Mojaddedi said that he would like to
be a mediator among all groups including the Taliban. He called
for an agreement on release of prisoners of the war and
disarmament in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Late last October, Iran held a conference on Afghanistan
without participation of any Afghan groups.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, which reportedly supports the Taliban militia which
seized the Afghan capital Kabul on September 27, 1996, driving
out the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, refused to
attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been supporting the deposed government, which allied
with the faction of northern Uzbek leader Abdul Rashid Dostam
after losing Kabul.

<HEADLINE> Half Of UK's Children Can't Put London On Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Fewer than half the children in
Britain -- 47 percent -- can find London on a blank map, with some
even thinking it is in the north of Scotland, a survey found.
</P>
<P>
Government curriculum advisers were concerned at the extent of
the children's ignorance. They admitted that the evidence from 900
pupils aged eight to 16 was "surprising and disturbing."
</P>
<P>
The national curriculum says children should be able to
identify principal cities, regions and rivers on a map of the UK
by the age of 11.
</P>
<P>
Geography has been a compulsory part of the national curriculum
for children aged eight to 14 since 1991, and voluntary for those
aged 14 to 16.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by NOP for Microsoft electronic
publishers, uncovered even greater ignorance of foreign countries.
Only 42 percent could identify Germany on a map of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Only 18 percent knew that the Acropolis was in Greece. Almost
20 percent had no idea that the Pyramids were in Egypt or that the
Status of Liberty was in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The School Curriculum and Assessment Authority said, "We would
hope that children following the national curriculum would be much
better equipped to answer this kind of question."

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Apologizes to Kim Over "Comfort Women" Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today apologized to South Korean President Kim Young Sam
over remarks by his top spokesman about Tokyo's use of sex slaves
during World War Two.
</P>
<P>
At a lunch meeting before the start of a bilateral summit in
southwestern Japan, Hashimoto repeated Tokyo's deep remorse for
forcing many Asian women known as "comfort women" to serve as
prostitutes for Japanese soldiers before and during World War Two.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told Kim, "The Japanese government's and my stance on
this issue remain unchanged," Kyodo news service reported.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was speaking after the government's Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama criticized the planned coverage
in junior high school textbooks of Asian women forced to provide
sex for wartime Japanese soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Last June the Education Ministry approved the inclusion of
accounts of "comfort women" in all seven authorized junior high
school history textbooks that will be used from next April.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a government statement in August 1993
admitting that in many cases the women were recruited against
their will and that at times, administrative and military
personnel directly took part in the recruitment.
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama said that there was a "social background" to Japan's
wartime use of some 200,000 women, mainly from the Korean
Peninsula then under Japan's colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the premier's official residence
Friday evening, Kajiyama said, "It is odd teaching (children)
about the comfort women issue, without telling them about the
social background to the authorized prostitution system at that
time."
</P>
<P>
President Kim told Hashimoto Korean people were outraged by
Kajiyama's remarks. "This is a very delicate issue for South
Korean people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The remarks were made at a pretty unfortunate time and they
were shocking to South Korean people."
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto repeated the comments he made at a summit meeting in
South Korea last June, saying there was no way for Japan to defend
itself on the comfort women issue.
</P>
<P>
"I made it plain in Cheju Island (South Korea) that this is an
issue that greatly hurt the women's honor and dignity and I
expressed our deep regret and offered a heartfelt apology," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The row over the comfort women issue and Kajiyama's statements
marred the hour-long summit meeting during which Hashimoto and Kim
emphasized the positive areas of bilateral relations, which have
been frail at best since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed continued coordination between Tokyo and Seoul
toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to hold a forum in Osaka this
spring to promote youth exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after the summit, they admitted the
two nations remain apart over several issues, but expressed
confidence they can overcome them through "future-oriented
relations," reports said.
</P>
<P>
"We can't hide and erase what happened in the past and we must
develop our future while looking at the past," Kim said.

<HEADLINE> PNA Demands Israel to Take Next Steps Beyond Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has called on Israel to take further steps by
holding negotiations on other issues beyond the recent Hebron
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Hebron said that the call was issued at the
first PNA cabinet meeting chaired by PNA President Yasser Arafat
Friday night in Hebron. This was the second visit to the West
Bank city by Arafat since his victorious first visit last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA called on Israel to start negotiations on the issues
of opening safe passages between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Gaza
airport and Gaza port, and the release of Palestinian security
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
According to the Note For the Record compiled by the United
States to accompany the Hebron agreement, the negotiations on
these issues should begin immediately following the Hebron
pullback, which was completed on January 17.
</P>
<P>
The PNA cabinet meeting also discussed the leading dispute
with Israel over the establishment of an independent Palestinian
state with eastern Jerusalem as its capital, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has made clear its objection to creating such a
Palestinian state and has vowed never to let Jerusalem, its
self-claimed eternal capital, to be redivided.
</P>
<P>
At the Friday meeting, Arafat appointed one of the leading
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) figures in Hebron Sheikh
Talal Sider as the Minister of Youth and Sports.
</P>
<P>
Sider is the first Hamas leader in the West Bank being
appointed as a PNA minister, and also the second Hamas minister
in the PNA after Imad Falouji, the former Hamas leader in Gaza
who was named the communications minister.
</P>
<P>
Aged 43, Sider was deported by Israel military authorities to
Marj Az-Zuhour in southern Lebanon along with 400 other Hamas
members in late 1992.
</P>
<P>
Sider's appointment signaled Arafat's efforts to strike
reconciliation with Hamas which enjoys widespread support in
Hebron. Hamas, the leading Palestinian militant group, is
opposed to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and has been
launching attacks against Israel.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Still Planning to Meet Chirac, Kremlin Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
who is recovering from double pneumonia, is going ahead with plans
to meet his French counterpart, Jacques Chirac, Yeltsin's Press
Secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said today.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent response to rumors that the Russian-French
summit scheduled for January 29 would be cancelled, following the
second postponement of the summit of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin has begun
preparations for his meeting with Chirac, which was now postponed
to February 2.
</P>
<P>
"He (Yeltsin) today requested the necessary materials and
documents" for the summit, said the press secretary.
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty and concerns over Yeltsin's health deepened Friday
after the Kremlin said that he would not return to his office soon
and decided to postpone a CIS summit scheduled for next week, the
second postponement within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The delay has fueled widespread speculation that his condition
is worse than the Kremlin is admitting.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not Yeltsin will chair the CIS summit has been
viewed as a key test of the state of his health.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president, who has not been seen in public since
January 6, is reportedly recovering at his country villa from
double pneumonia which kept him hospitalized for 12 days. Last
November, the president underwent a heart by-pass operation.

<HEADLINE> Education for Disabled Children Urged in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A workable solution has been
urged to develop a comprehensive education policy to cover the
majority of disabled children who are currently out of school in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Deputy Minister of Education Bertram
m'Membe when he officially launched the Zambia Association of the
Disabled Students (ZADS) here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation is so serious that it has resulted in a
serious backlog of illiterate handicapped people in the country
and new generations of disabled children would face similar bleak
prospects if concerned efforts were not launched.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is need for a workable solution to be
found by the state in collaboration with key stakeholders like
the ZADS to develop a comprehensive policy to cover the majority
of disabled youths who are out of the school system.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the Ministry of Education will ensure equality
of education oppotunities, quality education, the supervision and
management of special education for disabled children.
</P>
<P>
ZADS Director Pharry Mudinga on the occasion appealed to
government institutions and business houses to assist the
association in its efforts to address the education of disabled
children.
</P>
<P>
There are 445,000 disabled children and youths in Zambia, out
of whom only 4,000 have received some form of education. enditem

<HEADLINE> Swedish Banks May Hold More Jewish Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 3 million Swedish kronor
(416,666 U.S. dollars) was deposited in Swedish banks by Jews who
later died during World War Two, the Swedish Banking Association
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Taking inflation into account, the value of these deposits may
now be about 59 million Swedish kronor (8.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
A total of 902 dormant bank accounts are included on a list
compiled in 1964, based upon accounts held on December 15, 1945.
</P>
<P>
Most of the accounts on the list were established by foreign
nationals before 1940.
</P>
<P>
Swedish banks paid 1.2 million Swedish kronor (166,666 dollars)
from dormant accounts to the Red Cross in 1972, which distributed
the money to Jewish victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish Foreign Ministry has now established a working
group, including representatives of the Jewish community, the
Swedish Central Bank and the banking association, to consider
claims to the dormant accounts.
</P>
<P>
The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, announced earlier this
week that an investigation will be made into allegations that the
Riksbank used up to seven tons of Nazi gold which may have been
looted from countries occupied by Nazi Germany during the war.
</P>
<P>
Sweden reportedly knowingly sold iron to Nazi Germany in
exchange for 20 tons of gold, 7 tons of which was said to be
stolen.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Gov't Refuses to Hold Dialogue With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zairean government today
rejected "any idea of (holding) dialogue with the rebels" and
reaffirmed its determination to "recover the totality of occupied
territory" in the eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted the Zairean government as
saying in a communique, which was broadcast by the Zairean
national radio following a meeting of the cabinet, that
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda were "on the side of the rebels."
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa also accused the Tutsi rebels of using children as a
"human shield" to fend off the attack by government forces.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the government forces are attacking the rebels
mainly in the region of Walikale, less than 200 kilometers west of
Goma and Bukavu, the two provincial capitals of the Kivu region
taken by the rebels in November last year.
</P>
<P>
The United States has called on Kinshasa and the rebels to
immediately arrange a cease-fire and hold dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Washington has expressed worry over an escalation of the
conflict in the Great Lakes region, after the Zairean government
began what it called a "thorough and devastating"
counter-offensive against the rebels since the beginning of the
new year.
</P>
<P>
The counter-offensive has also aroused concern of international
humanitarian groups working in eastern Zaire, where some 300,000
to 500,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees and Zairean civilians displaced
by fighting are struggling to survive hunger and diseases without
any protection from the international community.

ISLAMABAD, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
today refused to take part in the peace talks with their rivals to
be held in Tehran, said reports from Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
"We have sent no delegation to Tehran as we consider Iran is
not neutral," Taliban's Deputy Foreign Minister Abdul Jalil said
from the Taliban's headquarters of Kandahar in southwestern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Jalil denied a report that Taliban Foreign Minister Mohammed
Ghaus had arrived in Tehran for the talks aimed at ending the war
raging in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The reports said ousted Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani,
premier Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, former moderate Afghan president
Sibghatullah Mojaddedi and representatives of both northern
warlord Rashid Dostum and the Shiite Muslim Hezb-i-Wahdat faction
were already in Tehran for the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban today also set their administration's acceptance by
the opposition groups as a condition for talks.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations can be held with them (the opposition) provided
they accept the establishment of the Islamic government," said
Mohammad Rabbani, Chairman of the ruling Taliban Council in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"We are not against peace, but it should be genuine and based
on Islamic principles. Peace and negotiations are useless, if they
use them for re-equipping their military forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's refusal came two days after the Taliban swept up
control of two strategically crucial opposition-held towns north
of the capital Kabul after a fierce battle, and began advancing
towards the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
They seized the key Bagram airbase and the nearby town of
Charikar, about 50 kilometers north of Kabul, nine days ago and
then went on to the two key towns of Gulbahar and Jabul Siraj on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Economy Relies on Foreign Aid: Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean Finance
Minister Thaimu Bangura told the parliament here today that the
economy of the west African state "is totally dependent on
foreign aid."
</P>
<P>
"Until the country's economy picks up, Sierra Leone will
continue to depend on the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
World Bank and other donor agencies," Bangura told the
parliament at a late night session on the budget.
</P>
<P>
"I refused to comply with IMF's recommendation to further
increase the prices of petroleum products on the ground that the
people of Sierra Leone have reached the saturation point and can
no longer withstand the swings of taxation induced by the
structural adjustment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The last increase in petroleum products was some six months ago
with petrol now costing three U.S. Dollars per liter.
</P>
<P>
According to Bangura, the IMF responded by asking the minister
to "find methods of closing the 3.9 million U.S. Dollar deficit
in the economy."
</P>
<P>
"The budget is designed to promote sustainable growth of the
Gross Domestic Product, control inflation and improve our
internal current account balance as well as help reduce overall
budget deficit," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When the economy improves and we can stand on our own, we can
avoid the IMF," said the minister, noting that the economy is
"gradually picking up" as the country enjoys the confidence of
the business community since the signing of a peace agreement
last November.
</P>
<P>
Bangura said despite the difficult economic climate, inflation
has been reduced from 38.3 percent to 5.6 percent "within the
short period of the return to civilian rule."

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls for End to Karabakh Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani today called for an immediate end to Karabakh
crisis and said that resolving the issue would serve to develop
Iran's cooperation with Armenia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Armenian Foreign Minister
Alexander Arzumanyan, Rafsanjani said establishment of a lasting
peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Karabakh would lead to
fostering tripartite cooperation among the three countries.
</P>
<P>
"This would also help resolve regional problems and
strengthening the economic strength of the Caucasus countries,"
he was quoted as saying by the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani reiterated that regional issues should be settled
without foreign intervention and by the states in the region
themselves.
</P>
<P>
He expressed pleasure with the growing cooperation between
Iran and Armenia and said expediting implementation of the
accords already signed and activating Tehran-Yerevan
parliamentary friendship would further develop bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Arzumanyan submitted a written
message from Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan to his
Iranian counterpart Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian foreign minister appreciated Iranian initiatives
in helping restore peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Arzumanyan said the visit paid by Iranian first
Vice-President Hassan Habibi to Armenia opened a new chapter in
bilateral relations and the agreements reached during the visit
would serve as a pattern for other countries in the region to
follow.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Condemns Foreign Intervention in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati today once again condemned foreign interference
in Afghanistan, saying that the foreign intervention has
aggravated the situation in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing leaders of some Afghan factions who are attending
the two-day Afghanistan Peace Conference which opened here this
afternoon, the Iranian foreign minister said "Iran is opposed to
any kind of foreign interference in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
However, he did not specify the names of the countries. Iran
has accused the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia of
supporting the Taliban, a main political group which controls
over 70 percent of Afghanistan, with military supplies.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said at the conference that Iran believes in the
territorial integrity, independence and national unity of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Seven Afghan political groups, including the Islamic Party,
the National Liberation Front, the National Islamic Movement and
the Unity Party, are attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban refused to attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
"Afghanistan should retrieve its peace and stability as soon
as possible and should appear on international scene
decisively," Velayati said.
</P>
<P>
Without restoration of peace and security in Afghanistan, the
region will not see stability, Velayati added.
</P>
<P>
"Iran believes that the Afghan crisis is a domestic issue and
only the Afghan leaders are able to bring peace to Afghanistan,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Iranian officials have always made clear in their
negotiations with the Afghan leaders that resorting to force is
useless and have stressed the need for holding peace talks at
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the hard living condition in Afghanistan, he
call for humanitarian aid of the international organizations and
said that Iran has always extended its humanitarian aid to the
Afghan people and will do the same in the future.

<HEADLINE> Three Turkish Warships Arrive in Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Three Turkish warships arrived
today in the Turkish occupied port of Famagusta on the eastern
coast of Cyprus in a show of solidarity with the Turkish Cypriot
regime.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today, the Turkish warships
will remain in the Famagusta port until Wednesday, January 29,
during which they will be open to visits by Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Defense Minister Turhan Tayan has claimed this is
"a peaceful visit", while Turkish Cypriot daily Kibris described
the visit as "an answer to Greek Cypriot armaments."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish warships' visit comes following a tension on this
Mediterranean island after the Cyprus government concluded an
agreement for the purchase of Russian anti-aircraft missiles
S-300.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has warned that it will strike at the missiles if
they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Famagusta municipality in southern government-controlled areas
issued Friday a protest at the visit of the Turkish vessels
to the occupied port, describing it as "contrary to
international law and U.N. decisions and resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The municipality appealed to the international community, and
especially the U.N. Security Council to "stop the illegal
action."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been split into Greek Cypriot south and Turkish
Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops seized the northern
third of the island in the wake of a short-lived coup seeking
union with Greece by some Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side declared unilaterally in 1983 a
breakaway state, "The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus",
which is recognized only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> World Running Out Of Water, UN Reports Warn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Large areas of the globe will
start running critically short of water in the next 30 years
unless there is a revolution in the way people use water, two UN
reports warned.
</P>
<P>
Total water consumption worldwide has been growing at 2.5
percent a year, roughly twice as fast as population growth. It has
risen sixfold this century.
</P>
<P>
In 30 years' time, 27 nations, all but three of them in North
Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, are forecast to be in the
UN's "high water stress" category.
</P>
<P>
They will face "serious scarcity," with "an urgent need for
intensive management of supply and demand." Water shortages will
act as a brake on their economic growth, the UN reports said.
</P>
<P>
The two reports, written as a follow-up to the 1992 Rio Earth
summit, said that water shortages are as urgent as any other
global environmental issue.
</P>
<P>
With some 300 major river basins crossing national boundaries
"future conflicts (over their water) are a potent risk," the
reports warned.
</P>
<P>
Among the most likely flash-points are thought to be the river
Jordan, whose waters are shared between Israel and Arab
neighbors, the Nile, which flows through Ethiopia, Sudan and
Egypt, and the headwaters of the Euphrates and Tigris shared
between Turkey, Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of countries, including India, China, the US
and some southern ex-USSR republics, are now taking water from
aquifers at a much faster rate than they can ever be replenished
by rain.
</P>
<P>
In some countries, such as Libya, farming and industry have
come to depend on underground "fossil" water, which comes from
rain which fell thousands of years ago. Once "mined," it can never
be replaced, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Farming consumes most of the water used by humanity, with
increases in irrigation largely responsible for the huge increases
in crop production needed to feed a fast-growing population.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the UN reports said, many great rivers no longer
reach the sea, and wildlife-rich swamplands have dried out.

<HEADLINE> Military Solution to Afghan Issue Not Acceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. special envoy Norbert
Holl today indirectly criticized the Taliban for launching latest
 military offense in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Afghanistan Peace Conference which opened here
today, he said, "the United Nations deeply deplored the new
outbreak of hostility which we have witnessed during the last 10
years."
</P>
<P>
However, he did not specify any political and military groups
by names.
</P>
<P>
But, he stressed, "the military solution of Afghan conflict
is not possible and "would not be acceptable to the
international community."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the outbreak of hostilities may also endanger
the implementation of certain confidence-building measures among
the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
"It is the firm conviction of the U.N. Security Council that
peace can be found only with the constructive cooperation of all
warring factions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Afghan people have to sit together and settle
their differences among themselves.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy criticized the mentality in Afghanistan
that "victory is just around the corner. Let's keep fighting a
little longer and the whole of Afghanistan will be ours."
</P>
<P>
"This mentality is wrong," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Holl strongly appealed to the Afghan parties to
stop their fighting immediately and come back to the conference
table under the good offices of the United Nations in
cooperation with the Organization of Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to all countries of influence for their
support to his mission in a constructive spirit in order to
bring an end to the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The only solution of the Afghan issue is to peacefully
establish broad-based Islamic government acceptable to all of
them," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
As to the peace conference sponsored by Iran, he said, "the
Tehran meeting gives me a valuable opportunity of even better
coordinating the U.N. efforts with freedom of initiatives."
</P>
<P>
"The meeting may also help to understand each other better in
our common search for peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on refusal by the Taliban for the
conference, he said, a meeting without the full participation of
the Supreme Council for the Defense of Afghanistan would not
have been in line with the action I have to follow within the
U.N. mandate and within strict impartiality which I have to
observe."
</P>
<P>
"A meeting without full and constructive participation of all
major Afghan groups can hardly bring closer to a negotiated
settlement since it is first of all up to the Afghan themselves
to discuss ways and means of peace," he said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Syria Sees No Change in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today Syria has seen no positive changes on the part
of Israel to resume the stalled talks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Syria did not receive any indications that
Israel approved to resume negotiations from the point they ended
and on the basis of the Madrid formula of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
"No change was made in the Israeli stance, hence the Syrian
stance has not changed," Moussa said quoting Syrian Vice President
Abdel Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouk el-Sharaa during
their recent visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian top diplomat made the statement before departure
to Riyahd, the capital of the Saudi Arabia, for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Egypt backs the Syrian stance that talks with Israel have to
build on what has been accomplished in previous talks and on the
basis of the relevant UN resolutions and the land for peace
principle.
</P>
<P>
Asked on European and American efforts to resume the
Syrian-Israeli negotiations, Moussa said there should be endeavors
in this respect noting that various countries contribute to resume
these suspended negotiations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
On-again and off-again peace talks that began in 1991 have been
stuck over the fate of the Golan Heights captured by Israel from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has appealed to
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to meet at the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
But Syria has dismissed the overture, saying that peace talks
should start where they ended and there is nothing new in the
Israeli proposal that the land-for-peace principle is the basis of
the future talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu rejects Syria's demand that Israel return the
strategic plateau towering over both countries for peace as agreed
by former Labor government of Israel under late Premier Yitzhak
Rabin.
</P>
<P>
The verbal assurances from Rabin convinced Syria that Israel
was ready to withdraw from the Golan. In return, Syria was to
establish full diplomatic relations and attempt to normalize ties.
</P>
<P>
In Tel Aviv, Israel's Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has
said that he expected Israelis and Syrians to meet in the next few
months to revive their deadlocked peace talks.
</P>
<P>
International efforts reportedly are under way to get them
restarted following the successful completion of
Israeli-Palestinian talks over the West Bank city of Hebron.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Customs Foil Heroin Smuggling Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers at Saudi
Arabian coast city of Jeddah had foiled an attempt to smuggle more
than 4.5 kg of pure heroin into the Kingdom by a whole family of
21 members from a West Asian country, reports reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the family who arrived in Jeddah Wednesday night
to visit the Kingdom were arrested at King Abdul Aziz Airport
after the drugs were uncovered from their bodies.
</P>
<P>
Saudi authorities described the arrest as the first such case
involving members of a single family in the Kingdom and they were
appalled that children were used for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The smugglers used five infants and two children to cover
up their operation. Among the drug carriers were two women
who were pregnant.
</P>
<P>
The members of the family appeared lethargic and
uncomfortable leading Customs officials to closely follow their
movements in the airport lounge. Officials who suspect that
they might have concealed drugs in their private parts
detained them and had a special doctor and a team of
nurses to help them expel the drugs from their bodies.
</P>
<P>
The family was already transferred to a drug jail and
Customs sources said the trials could last up to three years.
The children are expected to be placed into foster homes in
their home country, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The arrested would be presumed innocent until proven guilty
by a Sharia court, they said.
</P>
<P>
Drug smugglers were usually beheaded in Saudi Arabia
according to the Islamic Sharia law after they were proven
criminal.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen persons of the family were found carrying egg
shaped heroin packages with the oldest Umar Begum at 43
years and the youngest Anem at five years of age.
</P>
<P>
The reports did not say from which country the drug
smuggling family was arriving at Jeddah.

KAMPALA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of Natural
Resources Gerald Sendaula has expressed concern over the
reduction of Uganda's forest estates from eight percent
to six percent in recent years, reported Radio Uganda today.
</P>
<P>
Sendaula expressed concern while officiating at the closure of

on bio-mass and timbers.
</P>
<P>

forests to educate the community to take keen interrest in tree
planting to avoid total destruction of the country's environment.
</P>
<P>
The minister also assured the participants that the government was
studying the issue of investing income from forests into the forest
sector.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ousted Afghan President Appeals for World Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Ousted Afghan president
Burhanuddin Rabbani today called on the international community
and the peace-loving countries of the world to stand against
"brutality and hostility" by the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Afghanistan Peace Conference which opened here
this afternoon, he accused the Taliban, a main political group in
Afghanistan, of launching a war and conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Although we expected a ceasefire in the Holy month of
Ramadan, we would have a cessation of hostilities, unfortunately,
the Taliban waged the war," said the ousted Afghan president
</P>
<P>
He said that the war in Afghanistan is not one between
ethnic groups or tribes. It is not between parties or
different religions, the main factor for the continuation of the
war is foreign intervention, which continues to ignite the
flames of the war.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani accused some foreign countries of providing armament to
the Taliban. But he did not specify them by names at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
He noted that no government can impose itself on
Afghanistan by resorting to force no matter how powerful it
is. "Those who want to resolve the problem of Afghanistan by
resorting to war are making a big mistake."
</P>
<P>
He said that the security in Afghanistan serves the security
of all countries in the region, all the neighboring countries
should work for peace and security in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about Afghan groups, he said, all the Jihad leaders
want to put an end to the hostility and the war there.
</P>
<P>
He stressed "the hostilities should end and we must have
a situation in Afghanistan toward disarmament. We must establish
a peaceful Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Ousted prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar echoed at the
conference that the current crisis in Afghanistan has to do
with internal factors but also there are some very important
external factors.
</P>
<P>
He said that some countries put hope in the continuation
or prolong action of the war. These countries are igniting the
flames of the war in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the crisis in Afghanistan would be solved
if the foreign intervention in the internal affairs of
Afghanistan are stopped," he added.
</P>
<P>
He called on neighboring countries to make a commitment not
to allow foreign intervention in Afghanistan's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The ousted prime minister said "We must have an agreement on
the ceasefire. No one should think that they can run the country
by resorting to force and by conquering cities."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia, which seized the Afghan capital Kabul on
September 27, 1999 and controls over 70 percent of Afghanistan,
refused to attend the conference. Enitem

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea Deny Involvement in Sudan's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia and Eritrea today denied
their involvement in the lastest conflicts between the Sudanese
government and rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Ambassadress in Cairo Konjit Simegiorgis said after
attending a meeting in the foreign ministry here that Ethiopia has
not been involved in the current conflicts in eastern Sudan
"between the Sudanese government forces and the opposition troops."
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia has affirmed that it sides with Sudan's territorial
integrity," she said while praising Egypt's stand on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak said recently that the
latest development in Sudan is its domestic affairs and there is
not evidence of involvement of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Egypt objects
to the division of Sudan and supports its integrity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a statement distributed by the Eritrean Embassy
here, Eritrea charged the Sudanese government of "blaming others for
its own problems" and misleading the public opinion.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Arab Radio and Television (ART)
Network, Eritrean President Isaias Aforki, however, did not deny
its "overt" support to the Sudanese rebels.
</P>
<P>
"If the opposition represents the people we would back the
opposition as it would mean a support for the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of the recent statements by Mubarak, he said
Egypt knows better than any other party the truth about the
situation in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir has said Ethiopia and
Eritrea are behind the raging battles in eastern Sudan and issued
a mobilization call but both countries deny the charges.
</P>
<P>
A coalition of northern and southern opposition forces began
attacking Sudanese army units along the eastern border of the
country nearly two weeks ago in what they said a bid to pressure
the Sudanese government and pave the way for a popular uprising.

<P>
CAIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian security forces killed
three terrorists belonging to the military wing of the Islamic
Group in a fierce battle in a densely-populated area in southern
Egypt today.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Meets With Ousted Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani met here this evening with ousted Afghan president
Burhanuddin Rabbani, a gesture to support him as the head of the
legitimate government in the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Iranian television reported that Rabbani expressed
his thanks to President Rafsanjani for Iran's constant efforts
in resolving the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We and our anguished people hope that Islamic Iran would
succeed in its efforts to bring the different Afghan factions
to the negotiating table thereby paving the way for a
ceasefire and restoration of peace in war-torn Afghanistan,"
Rabbani said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani for his part expressed hope that the Afghan
crisis would be settled peacefully at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Afghan crisis has no military solution
and that Iran hopes that the various Afghan factions, which are
attending the two-day Afghanistan Peace Conference here, would
exert maximum efforts to reach a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani announced Iran's readiness to render any kind of
help which would materialize peace and stability in neighboring
Afghanistan in the interests of the Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
Seven Afghan groups, including the Islamic Party, the National
Liberation Front, the National Islamic Movement and the Unity
Party participated the conference.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban, the major political and military group
which controls more than 75 percent of Afghanistan, refused to
attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the first session of the conference, an
expert committee was formed for drafting the final communique of
the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The committee is made up of representatives of Afghan
political parties and Iranian Foreign Ministry's Director for
West Asian Affairs Mir-Mahmoud Musavi.
</P>
<P>
During its meeting tonight and tomorrow morning the committee
is to prepare the draft of the final statement.
</P>
<P>
Late last October, Iran held a Conference on Afghanistan
without participation of any Afghan groups.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, on September 27,
1996 is considered as a major setback in Iran's foreign
policy. Iran called the Taliban as a hand-raised group, which has
flourished as a result of U.S. planning, Saudi Arabian financial support
and Pakistan's logistical backing.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been supporting the deposed government, which allied
with the faction of northern Uzbek leader Abdul Rashid Dostam
after losing Kabul.

<P>
GENEVA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Reto Goetschi took the home
track advantage to pilot his Swiss sled to a gold medal in the
two-man competition at the world bobsleigh championships in
St. Moritz, Switzerland on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Goetschi and breakman Guido Acklin, bronze medallists at last
year's championships, clocked the fastest times in three of four
trips down the 1.6 kilometer natural ice track finishing with a
four-run combined time of four minutes, 17.59 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Guenther Huber and Antonio Tartaglia, fresh from a
victory at the European championships last weekend, had held a
wafer-thin 0.01 seconds advantage on the Swiss duo after the first
run.
</P>
<P>
But the Italians lost ground in each of the next three rounds
and settled for silver, almost a second back, with an aggregate
time of 4:18.57
</P>
<P>
Brian Shimer and Robert Olesen of the United States, sixth
after the first run, fought back to take the bronze with 4:18.67.

<HEADLINE> Export Commodities Quality Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The quality of China's export
commodities showed further improvement last year, according to the
State Administration for Inspection on Import and Export
Commodities.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the administration inspected 1.6 million groups of
export commodities with a total value of 50 billion US dollars,
and found that 13,000 batches of commodities, valued at 440
million US dollars, were substandard.
</P>
<P>
Tian Runzhi, director of the administration, said that the
inspection organizations, by tightening their own inspection
procedures, helped the export-oriented companies improve their
product quality.
</P>
<P>
According to Tian, more quality certificates were granted to
export firms in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that last year, the administration issued
approximately 1,200 hygiene certificates to foodstuff-producing
firms, and some 1,600 quality certificates to other
firms. Meanwhile, ten firms had their certifications revoked as a
result of bad management.
</P>
<P>
The administration also issued ISO9000 certificates to 233
firms, which indicates international affirmation of their product
quality.
</P>
<P>
And the administration inspected 300,000 groups of import
goods, worth 41.3 billion US dollars, finding 30,000 groups, worth
1.7 billion US dollars, that were below standard.
</P>
<P>
After inspection, the foreign-funded equipment, with a quoted
price of 4.27 billion US dollars, was shown to be worth only 3.96
billion US dollars, said the administration.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Oil Company of
Iraq is well prepared to increase production in northern oil
fields to meet the country's future export needs.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) today quoted an official of the
Iraqi Oil Ministry as saying that the company, one of the biggest
oil companies in Iraq, is working hard to develop the efficiency
of productive establishments and continue digging and repairing
oil wells for the future export needs.
</P>
<P>
The company has successfully reconstructed the Iraqi-Turkish
oil pipeline and pumping stations along the line which were
damaged during the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi crude oil was pumped through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline
for the first time on December 10, 1996 after the implementation
of the oil-for-food deal signed between Iraq and the U.N. on May
20 last year.
</P>
<P>
The deal allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil every six months to buy food and medicine for its people
who are suffering under a six-year-old U.N. sanctions imposed on
Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Undersecretary Sami Sherif said recently that the Oil
Ministry is planning to expand export capacity via neighboring
states to raise exports and ensure an uninterrupted flow of Iraqi
oil to world markets.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Likud, Labor Parties Sign Paper on Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A number of Israeli
parliamentarians from the ruling Likud and opposition Labor
parties today signed a joint position paper for the final status
talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that in order to achieve a permanent agreement
with the Palestinians, it is necessary to permit the establishment
of a Palestinian entity whose status will be determined in future
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Heads of the two teams, Likud member of knesset (parliament)
Michael Eitan and Labor member Yossi Beilin, will present the
joint document to President Ezer Weizman and then to Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the Knesset this afternoon, Eitan
and Beilin said that although the paper had been signed just by a
handful of members, it shows that the two rival parties have for the
first time reached a national consensus regarding relations
between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The document came into being following a series of
discussions and clarifications between the Likud and Labor
politicians in the past few months and in advance of the final
status talks between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
According to the four-page document, titled "National
Agreement Regarding the Negotiations on the Permanent Settlement
with the Palestinians," the two rival parties have reached a
national consensus on the basis of some vital principles.
</P>
<P>
The document says, "It is necessary to continue the dialogue
with the Palestinian representatives and to pursue exhaustively
every opportunity to achieve a permanent agreement with them. In
the framework of such an agreement it is necessary to permit the
establishment of a Palestinian entity whose status will be
determined in negotiations between the parties and the limits on
the sovereignty of which will be discussed in the following
sections."
</P>
<P>
"Under conditions of peace and following the achievement of
an agreement on the issue of the permanent settlement, the State
of Israel must preserve its ability to prevent every attack or
risk of an attack on its territorial integrity, the safety of
its citizens and their property and in its vital interests in
Israel and in the world," it continues.
</P>
<P>
The document states, "No agreement signed by the Israeli
government can include a commitment to uproot Jewish settlements
in the Western Land of Israel nor will any agreement compromise
the rights of the residents to keep their Israeli citizenship
and their ties as individuals and as a community with the State
of Israel."
</P>
<P>
Beilin, architect of the Oslo Accords, said that the paper is
only a starting point possibly for the majority of the Labor and
Likud members to come together and share a common ground. He
explained that the reality has made it possible for him and
Eitan to arrive at the conclusion that it is necessary to reach
a national consensus.

WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The differences between the Clinton Administration and the
Republican Congress have narrowed sufficiently so that both sides
for the first time are expressing cautious optimism that they can
reach a deal on a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
-- A global campaign that would extend credit to help poor
people start small businesses is expected soon to be endorsed by
the Clinton Administration, foreign leaders and development
agencies.
</P>
<P>
-- New opportunities appear to be emerging to reduce tensions
on the Korean Peninsula, including a meeting this week on a
proposal for talks that could bring a formal end to the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The day after he called for a new era of bipartisanship and
cooperation in his second inaugural address, President Clinton put
money where his mouth was. His new budget, he announced with
flourish, would meet Republicans halfway on the thorny issue of
how much to restain the growth of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
-- In a break with its longstanding policy of an independent
atomic arsenal, France is considering sharing its nuclear umbrella
with Germany and has agreed to begin talks on the matter.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Afghan warring factions called
for an immediate ceasefire in a declaration issued here this

</P>
<P>
It also called for the creation of a safe and secure

<HEADLINE> First Beijing Afforestation Fund in Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Afforestation Fund,
China's first regional program to promote comprehensive tree
planting and environmental protection, went into operation today
in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
According to the fund's new executive president, Shan
Zhaoxiang, a former leading official in charge of local
afforestation, the project will contribute one million yuan (about
120,000 US dollars) to key afforestation projects in the city this
year.
</P>
<P>
And that's only the beginning, he said, the city plans to
increase its downtown afforestation rate to 35 percent by the end
of this century, increase the average area of public green land
per resident to eight square meters, and produce 100 million
individual fresh flowers annually.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the downtown afforestation rate will be
increased to 40 percent and each resident will have ten square
meters of public green land, Shan said.
</P>
<P>
To carry out its duties, Shan said the fund aims at widely
publicizing the policies on afforestation, heighten public awareness
of bio-ecology and environmental protection, increase public
concern about the afforestation of the capital city, and support
key planting projects.
</P>
<P>
The organization will host seminars and hold training and
consultancy activities, Shan said. And outstanding donors to the
capital's afforestation drive will have memorial trees or forests
planted in their name.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has 680,000 hectares of forest, with an overall
forest coverage rate of 37 percent. Of this amount, the downtown
area's rate of coverage is 33 percent, with 16,500 hectares of
green land. Each resident has 7.1 square meters.
</P>
<P>
In China, the overall afforestation rate is 13 percent, and
Beijing is among the best-forested cities. But the capital still
has 140,000 more hectares of bare hills and mountains that have
yet to be planted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten-plus years, leading Party and government
officials have planted trees in the capital. Deng Xiaoping did so
every year from 1979 to 1989. And Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has planted trees each year since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua, Vice-Chairwoman of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee, is honorary president of the fund. Wang Jun,
board chairman of the China International Trust and Investment
Corporation (CITIC), will serve as chief adviser.
</P>
<P>
Experts and scholars from the state departments of
environmental protection, afforestation, finance, and law are
invited to be the fund's advisers.

<HEADLINE> PNA: No Peace Without Palestinian Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Minister of Local Government Saeb Erakat said
today peace could prevail only when the Palestinians have their
own independent state.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Voice of Arab radio this morning, Erakat
noted that if Israel wants to live in peace, Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu should make his people used to living
with a Palestinian independent state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want to establish their own independent state
with East Jerusalem as its capital when the interim agreements are
completed by May 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu has reportedly warned to reoccupy the West
Bank, which Israel captured during the 1967 Mideast War and is
handing over to the Palestinians through phaseal pullbacks, if a
Palestinian state is established.
</P>
<P>
Erakat, who is the chief negotiator during Hebron talks with
Israel, added that eight committees have been formed to deal with
Israel in their negotiations on the pending issues of the 1995
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced hope that those committees would reach protocols
for implementing the transitional accord signed by the two sides
in September 1995 and resolve the unsettled points such as the
safe corridor between Gaza and the West Bank, Palestinian
detainees, economic conditions, the Gaza airport and harbor.
</P>
<P>
"The road is still difficult and long," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PNA now controls the Gaza Strip and eight West Bank towns
handed over by Israel under several agreements signed since
1993. It will control the entire West Bank except Jewish
settlements and some Israel-defined "military areas" after the
completion of the third phase of Israeli troop redeployment in the
first half of 1998.

<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The per capita net income of
Chinese farmers in 1996 reached 1,900 yuan, hitting a new record
high since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented a 20 percent rise over that in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Economists said a bigger harvest was the major cause for the
rise in farmers' incomes. The average income of a farmer increased
by 50 yuan, merely due to the larger amount of grain output.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of farmers' income comes from agricultural
production; the boost in the agricultural income made up half
of the total increase.
</P>
<P>
Their income from the industry and the service sector also
enjoyed steady growth last year.
</P>
<P>
Economists explained that the agriculture in middle and western
regions of China has made big progress, as a result of solid
support from the central government.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the income of the farmers in those areas,
whose money comes mainly from the agriculture production, will
exceed that of their counterparts in eastern China for the first
time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The increase rate of the farmers' incomes in western China will
approach or reach the country's average level, and that of the
farmers in middle region of China will be above the average, they
said.
</P>
<P>
With its favorable geographic positioning, eastern China has
been enjoying a more rapid economic growth than middle and western
parts of China since the implementation of reform and opening-up
policies in 1978.
</P>
<P>
But since reforms began, preferential state policies have been
helping middle and western parts of China to catch up with the
eastern part of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A bomb planted in a British
patrol car went off in Ballynahich, Northern Ireland, early this
morning, slightly wounding a British soldier.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the injured soldier and two of his
colleagues were examing their patrol car in a public car park near
their base when the bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
"As the soldiers were carrying out security check on their car
the device exploded. It is a miracle that no one was killed or
badly injured," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>

local security sources noted that the explosion appeared to be the
latest IRA (Irish Republican Army) attack on British armed forces
in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The is the eighth such attacks since the start of the new year
and chief constable of Northern Ireland Ronnie Flanagan said that
the IRA was deliberately targeting the army and police forces in

<HEADLINE> Three-Year-Old Girl Safe after Car Crush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A three-year-old girl who was
run over twice by the same car escaped without a scratch.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Shanghai were amazed that the toddler survived the
double hit unscathed, apart from a minor bruise to her face.
</P>
<P>
The girl was rushed to a nearby hospital immediately after the
accident where doctors thoroughly checked her condition.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts claimed that it was extremely rare for a young
victim to suffer no serious injury after such a severe accident,
according to the local Wen Hui Bao (daily).
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred on January 15, when Han Ningning was
playing in the workshop of a taxi company, where her father was
working.
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, a Santana taxi ran over the girl after going
into reverse gear as passers-by screamed with shock.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the taxi heard about the screams and desperately
tried to go forward to avoid the child. But the rear wheel of the
vehicle went over the girl a second time.
</P>
<P>
When the girl's mother, Fan Hongxia, who was standing nearby,
rushed to help, her daughter was laying the ground unconscious
between the wheels of the car.
</P>
<P>
The girl remained unconscious until she arrived in
hospital. Soon after regaining consciousness she burst into cries.
</P>
<P>
Body scans and X-ray checks found, however, to the doctors'
astonishment, that the girl had survived without a broken bone and
was breathing normally. All she suffered was slight facial
bruising.
</P>
<P>
According to her parents, the girl has been doing a kind of
breathing exercise every day before and after lunch, and before
sleep since she was two years old.
</P>
<P>
She closes her eyes and breathes with her hands held, and cares
about nothing else. The exercise normally lasts some 20 minutes
each time. Her parents are wondering whether the breathing
exercise helped their daughter to survive what could have been an
horrific accident.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Inspection on Waste Materials Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China has improved its
inspection procedures used to evaluate imported waste materials,
according to the State Administration for Inspection on Import and
Export Commodities.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the administration show that from
January through November last year, various inspection organs
checked some two million tons or 500 million US dollars-worth of
imported waste materials.
</P>
<P>
Of this amount, 49,000 tons or 2.5 percent were found to be
below standard.
</P>
<P>
Items include: 2,163 tons of scrap paper, or 2.9 percent of the
total, 1,817 tons of scrap steel, or 2.8 percent of the total, 816
tons of scrap copper, or two percent of total, and 540 tons of
scrap aluminum, or 0.6 percent of the total imported.
</P>
<P>
The rate of poor quality of the imported waste materials has
dropped to some extent since last April, when the administration
first intensified its inspections, said the administration.
</P>
<P>
In November, 1.6 percent of the total imported waste paper was
unqualified; in April, the figure was seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The administration admitted that the situation was
unsatisfactory, as substandard waste materials were discovered in
some ports last year, and that pollutants were also found several
times.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The National Electoral
Commission of Nigeria (NECON), one of the five organs responsible
for the country's transition to civil rule program, is likely to
be reorganized soon, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reports said NECON's boss, chief Sumner Dagogo-Jack and at
least two commissioners are likely to be affected in the
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, dagogo-jack complained two weeks ago to
the head of state, General Sani Abacha that two commissioners
were uncooperative and that he would find it difficult to work
with them.
</P>
<P>
But several commissioners also complained during their
contacts in the power center that Dagogo-Jack was incompetent,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The presidency also has a security report which indicated
"discouraging" situation against Dagogo-Jack, it said.
</P>
<P>
Another report said the reorganization is expected to come
after the March 15 local government elections and aimed at
boosting the public confidence in the transition program.

<HEADLINE> NPC Legislative Affairs Commission Holds Meeting in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Commission of the
Legislative Affairs of the Chinese National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee held a meeting here today to solicit
opinions from Hong Kong residents on the election of the Ninth
NPC deputies in Hong Kong after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, the 23rd meeting of the NPC Standing
Committee approved a draft method for the election of the Ninth
NPC deputies of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Qiao Xiaoyang, vice-chairman of the commission, said that the
method was worked out in accordance with the Constitution of the
People's Republic of China, the Basic Law of the HKSAR and the Law
on the Election of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the method embodies the principle of "One
Country, Two Systems" and has taken into account the specific
conditions in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the term of the Eighth NPC will expire in March
1998 and the deputies to the Ninth NPC have to be elected by the
end of January 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said that at that time when HKSAR is founded, Hong Kong's
NPC deputies should be elected by the Chinese citizens in Hong
Kong rather by the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
According to the stipulations of the Law on the Election of the
NPC, the number of Hong Kong's deputies to the NPC is set at 29,
he said. "But owing to the special status of the HKSAR, the NPC
Standing Committee decided to add another seven seats for HKSAR's
deputies to the Ninth NPC."
</P>
<P>
He said that unlike other provinces, automonous regions and
municipalities in the interior areas, the HKSAR will not adopt the
system of the people's congress.
</P>
<P>
The draft method for the election of Ninth NPC deputies in the
HKSAR stipulated that the 36 NPC deputies of the HKSAR shall be
elected by an election committee formed by the Chinese-citizen
members of the Selection Committee for the First Government of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The election committee will further define specific methods for
the election of the HKSAR's deputies to the Ninth NPC, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao noted that the draft method to be further examined at the
Fifth Plenary Session of the Eighth NPC is only suitable for the
election of the ninth NPC deputies in the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
As for the future election of the NPC deputies in the HKSAR, he
said, the NPC will formulate new rules in compliance with the
principle of developing democracy step by step and in an orderly
way.
</P>
<P>
In the process of drafting the method, the Legislative Commission
of the NPC Standing Committee set great store by seeking advice from
the Hong Kong residents of various sectors, adding that some of the
constructive suggestions have been adopted in the draft method, he
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that his commission expects further suggestions from
the Hong Kong people so as to further improve the draft method
before it is submitted to Fifth Plenary Session the Eighth NPC in
March.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the meeting today were more than 80 of
Hong Kong's NPC deputies and members of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
including Henry Fok Ying-tung, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National
Committee.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zimbabwe Speeds up Development of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
put in the first place development of agriculture, an economic
base which determines the tempo of the country's economic growth,
and made achievements in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the southern African country reaped a recorded
bumper harvest, registering a 49 percent increase in the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Zimbabwe can feed the country's population of 11
million with maize, a staple food it gathered in last year, and
will export 300,000 tons this year, farm experts here say.
</P>
<P>
Other crops also registered marked growth, among which the
production of tobacco, Zimbabwe's largest foreign currency
earner, rose from 198,000 tons to 201,000 tons, earning about 600
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the bumper harvest, the year 1996 recorded an eight
percent growth of its gross domestic product (GDP), one of the
highest in the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
This year, Zimbabwe again is set for another bumper harvest,
with production of most crops expected to record increases of
more than 10 percent, if the present rainfall pattern continues.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural Minister Denis Norman recently expected maize
production to increase by 10 percent, and tobacco and cotton by
20 percent. "Zimbabwe will this year experience economic growth
of between six and seven percent," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken three major measures to achieve a
sustainable agricultural development:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, drawing up the Zimbabwe agricultural policy framework
(1995-2020), which gives full vision of the development of the
agricultural sector in the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
This document was prepared with the full participation of all
stake-holders in agriculture. Its focus is on the strategies for
generating more comprehensive and orderly agricultural growth
which matches the population increase.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, resolving the problem of water resources which is a
main reason of restricting the development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government embarked on a five-year
one-billion-Dollar project to build over 100 dams nationwide in a
bid to minimize the negative effects of the drought seasons, and
this year it will also mobilize private companies and farms to
build dams along with the state.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, accelerating the pace on resettlement program to
expand cultivated areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to acquire all underutilized and
useless farms from the whites to give them to landless black
farmers.
</P>
<P>
About 160,000 families need resettlement since Zimbabwe's
independence in 1980. And so far more than 70,000 families have
been resettled. The country's cultivated areas have been expanded
annually as a result of the resettlement program.

<HEADLINE> Graf to Meet Hingis in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- World number one Steffi Graf and
Martina Hingis were seeded to face each other in a potential final
at the Toray Pan Pacific Open tennis tournament which starts here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two came to Tokyo in quite different forms after Hingis
became the youngest grand slam champion this century by winning
the Australian Open Saturday at 16 years three months and 26 days.
</P>
<P>
Graf, 27, had been recovering from an infected toe injury and
heat-related illness after her shock fourth-round defeat to South
African Amanda Coetzer a week ago in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
It was her fastest exit since her early years on the tour.
</P>
<P>
She is also under heavy pressure after her father, Peter Graf,
was sentenced Friday in a Mannheim court to three years nine
months in prison for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Graf, the winner here in 1986, 1990 and 1994, received the
first-round bye before playing either American Lisa Raymond or a
qualifier.
</P>
<P>
She is in the same half with fifth-seeded defending champion
Iva Majoli of Croatia, third-seeded Conchita Martinez of Spain and
Dutch power-server Brenda Schultz-McCarthy, eighth seed.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who was unbeaten in 11 matches winning at Sydney and
Melbourne to climb up to second in the world, will take on the
winner between Gloria Pizzichini of Italy and Japanese wild card
entrant Rika Hiraki in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Also in the bottom half with Hingis are seventh-seeded Irina
Spirlea of Romania, sixth-seeded Lindsay Davenport of the United
States and fourth-seeded Huber.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain, Qatar Expected to Sign Pact at GCC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Qatar and Bahrain are
expected to sign an agreement on their territorial dispute at a
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) meeting due to open in the Saudi
city of Jeddah Tuesday, according to GCC sources.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) quoted the sources as saying last
night that the agreement was aimed at facilitating the atmosphere
for a final resolution of the territorial conflict between the two
GCC members and bolstering ties between them.
</P>
<P>
The other four GCC members -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and
the United Arab Emirates -- formed a foreign ministerial committee
last December in Doha of Qatar in an attempt to bring Qatar and
Bahrain together.
</P>
<P>
The four countries were "employing intensive efforts to
overcome the differences and observations of both Bahrain and
Qatar concerning the minutes of the agreement," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The committee had failed to convince the two countries to
agree to a memorandum of understanding during three meetings
already held in the Saudi capital of Riyadh and Doha earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Arab diplomats said the committee might introduce some
amendments to the document to narrow the differences between
Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Bahrain have been locked in a dispute over a cluster
of small and potentially oil-rich islands, sandbanks and reefs in
the Gulf, controlled by Manama since the 1930s, but also claimed
by Doha.
</P>
<P>
Doha submitted the dispute to the international Court of
Justice at the Hague in 1991, a move opposed by Manama which
insists on a regional solution.
</P>
<P>
Ties were further strained after Bahrain accused two Qataris
of spying, while Doha denied the accusations and boycotted late
last year the GCC summit convened in Qatar. Bahrain later
pardoned the two Qataris.
</P>
<P>
The remaining issues to be sorted out for the signing of the
agreement were the suspension of media campaigns and the full
commitment of mediation efforts made by Saudi Arabia that chairs
the committee.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also stipulates the prevention of any hostile
act against each country from the other.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said the Jeddah meeting would be held no
matter the differences were sorted out or not in order to define
the committee's next move.

CANBERRA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Australians were warned that
they would enter the second century of nationhood as a diminished
people unless there was genuine reconciliation with Aboriginal
people.
</P>
<P>
This was the message conveyed to the nation by Governor-General
William Deane during the Australia Day today.
</P>
<P>
Using his first Australia Day address since taking office to
promote reconciliation and multiculturalism, William said a matter
that must deeply concern all Australians was the appalling state
of Aboriginal health.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides of our national parliament have accepted the
importance of genuine reconciliation between aboriginal people and
Australians as a whole", he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must achieve it by the year 2001, otherwise we'll enter the
second century of our nation as a diminished people, we won't
achieve it until we reach the stage of basic justice and decency."
</P>
<P>
His speech was one of a series by prominent Australians calling
for Aboriginal reconciliation and endorsing multiculturalism.
</P>
<P>
They follow a year in which issues of immigration and
multiculturalism have been discussed widely, they also came at a
time when the place of Aboriginal people is again under debate
after the High Court's Wik decision.
</P>
<P>
Following the multicultural and reconciliation theme, Prime
Minister John Howard hailed Australia's tolerance, openness and
freedoms as national achievements in an address responding to
recent overseas criticism of race issues in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Like any nation, we have stains in our past, we have made
mistakes, we have done injustices to people", However, he stressed
that no nation in the world had more successfully absorbed people
from around the globe in a more tolerant fashion than had
Australia, he told an Australia Day ceremony in Adelaide today.

<HEADLINE> Transshipment of Logs from Neighboring Countries Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Allowed Through Malaysian Waters
</P>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian waters have
been made off-limits for the transshipment of logs from
neighboring countries, like Indonesia, which have banned the
export of logs, Primary Industry Minister Lim Keng Yaik said
today.
</P>
<P>
The transshipment of logs from these countries would not be
allowed through Malaysian waters anymore, he told a news
conference here today, adding "if they come to use our waters, the
authorities have been directed to send them (the ships) back".
</P>
<P>
He said he told the Cabinet last Wednesday that it is not an
easy thing to implement but it has to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
However, Lim said the transshipment of logs from countries,
like Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, which have not banned the
export of logs would be allowed through Malaysian waters.
</P>
<P>
The decision made by the Cabinet came in the wake of the
seizure of logs worth six million ringgit (2.4 million US dollars)
from a cargo vessel "Able Helmsmen" in Tawau, Sabah, East Malaysia
on January 18.
</P>
<P>
The case sparked a controversy between the Sabah state
government and the Federal government's Primary Industries
Ministry over who is in charge in giving approvals for log
exports.
</P>
<P>
Lim said today his ministry did not issue permits to export
logs from Sabah as claimed by the state government and urged Sabah
state Deputy Chief Minister Abdul Ghapur Salleh to stop making
"irresponsible statements and conduct a thorough investigation".
</P>
<P>
Ghapur who is also the state Finance Minister said yesterday
that the Sabah state government wanted the Primary Industries
Ministry to stop issuing approvals or permits to export logs from
Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Ghapur was quoted by local press reports as saying in Kota
Kinabalu, Sabah's capital, that "matters relating to forestry are
the sole right of the state government but it seems that the
(Primary Industries) ministry has also staked a claim of
jurisdiction".
</P>
<P>
Claiming "this is not true (the ministry's claim of
jurisdiction), Lim said his ministry had only issued approvals for
the re-export of excess logs following the request by four
companies which claimed they had already received orders from
countries like China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said it was very clear that the approvals were given after
they were certified by the Sabah Forestry Department.
</P>
<P>
Ghapur now heads a special committee formed by the Sabah state
government to investigate the log smuggling activities.

<HEADLINE> ATC Not to Renew Foreign Experts' Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Air Tanzania Corporation
(ATC) has opted not to extend the contracts of its three
technical experts on grounds that they were too costly for the
nation, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The trio was earning an average of about 360,000 U.S. Dollars
a year.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with ATC told reporters here on Saturday
that the three staff engaged four years ago, were paid about
10,000 Dollars a month each.
</P>
<P>
They are the Financial Advisor, Kotha, P. R. Vittal, Systems
and Audit Advisor, Narayanan R. Namibiar and the Management
Expert, Domirlique Prinet.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the services of Vital and Nambiar ended
on December 31 last year, while those of Prinet will cease at the
end of next month.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to their contracts, the experts are
supposed to be paid a 25 percent gratuity based on their four
year's salaries.
</P>
<P>
"Based on an average salary of 10,000 U.S. Dollars per month,
the trio earned 360,000 U.S. Dollars a year and 1,440,000 U.S.
Dollars in four years bringing the 25 percent gratuity for all to
360,000 U.S. Dollars meaning 120,000 U.S. Dollars for each," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the decision not to renew their
contracts was reached by the board last May although requested
for a one year extension of the contracts for the technical
staff.
</P>
<P>
The trio are here assisting ATC for preparation of a business
plan likely to secure assistance from International Finance
Corporation (IFC) for mapping out a divestiture strategy of ATC,
a project launched four years ago with the financial aid by the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The official claimed that although ATC was not paying the
three technical assistance staff directly, the money from the
World Bank was in form of a loan which the nation would at the
end of the day pay back.

<HEADLINE> Titanium Deposits found in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian company has
announced a major discovery of titanium, rutile and zircon
mineral deposits on east Kenyan coast, the Sunday Standard
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Tiomin Resources Inc. Chief Executive
Jean-Charles Potvin as saying that large titanium bearing sands
have been found at Mambrui and Sokoke in Kilifi district of
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Kenya's High Commissioner to Canada Hassan Bagha in
Ottawa on the firm's exploration efforts, Potvin said there is
over 650 million tons of titanium minerals and zircon bearing
sands at Mambrui.
</P>
<P>
He described the Mambrui and Sokoke areas as one of the
largest and highest grade undeveloped resources of titanium,
rutile and zircon in the world.
</P>
<P>
After drilling 128 holes in Mambrui, Sokoke and other sites,
Potvin stated, his company has established a resource prospect
exceeding 1.2 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
The combined titanium mineral resources in east Kenyan coast
demonstrate the potential for Kenya to be a future major producer
of these minerals, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Kenyan High Commissioner Bagha expressed the
hope that the Canadian company will soon start commercial mining
of the minerals.
</P>
<P>
A deep drilling program is about to commence at Sokoke to
determine the absolute depth of high grade zones in the western
margin of the mineral areas.
</P>
<P>
Some deep holes will also be drilled on the Mambrui prospect
to evaluate high grade zones not fully tested by the previous
drilling.

<HEADLINE> 11,000 Zimbabweans Lose Jobs in Textile Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 11,000 Zimbabwean
workers in the textile industry have now lost their jobs since
the beginning of the economic reform program six years ago, the
Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
But a recent report by the International Labor Organization
shows that these losses are not peculiar to Zimbabwe. In fact,
employment losses have been experienced in the textile, clothing
and footwear industries throughout Africa, Europe and North
America.
</P>
<P>
Only Asia has reported growth in its industries and now
produces more than 32 percent of the world's clothing exports.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, General Secretary of the Zimbabwe Textile
Workers' Union Simon Tsokotsa told the paper that high tariffs,
lack of a new trade agreement with South Africa and the
proliferation of second-hand clothes continue to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
He added Zimbabwe is, however, not the only one affected.
Available evidence suggests that gains have been made in the
informal sector in the trade of textiles, clothing and footwear,
at the expense of the formal sector.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Trade Unions Raps Govt Over ILO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) has condemned the government's refusal to ratify
some of the conventions of the International Labor Organization
(ILO).
</P>
<P>
ZCTU President Gibson Sibanda said in Mutare of east Zimbabwe
on Saturday that the labor movement was concerned by the comment
made last week by Minister of Public Service, Labor and Social
Welfare Florence Chitauro that the government will not ratify
some of the conventions.
</P>
<P>
He said it is imperative for the government to commit itself
to ratifying conventions that are of international standards to
enhance Zimbabwe's workers and protect its harmonized labor bill.
</P>
<P>
"We want the government to commit itself especially on the
core human rights conventions that incorporate, among other
things, the right to organize public servants strikes, abolition
of forced and child labor, discrimination, freedom of association
and we really want a study on how much child labor has affected
the country's future leaders," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week Chitauro said the government will not ratify some
ILO conventions as they will not in any way benefit the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister said even the so-called democratic countries like
the United States of America has not ratified all conventions.

<HEADLINE> Excessive Imports Cause Glut in Chemical Fertilizer Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China's chemical fertilizer
market suffered a glut caused by excessive imports last year, with
the surplus running to a record 6 million tons (calculated as 100
percent nitrogen).
</P>
<P>
China produced 25.6 million tons of fertilizer and imported
about nine million tons last year, while demand was about only 29
million tons, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Although China's current production capacity can't satisfy the
demand for chemical fertilizers, it is necessary to import only
about five million tons of fertilizers annually, the report quoted
an official with the Ministry of Chemical Industry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Banxue, a deputy director of the Ministry, noted most of
the excessive imports came in phosphate fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Since the production capacity of phosphate fertilizer was
limited by a shortage of raw materials because abundant phosphatic
ores in southwest China could not be shipped by train, he
explained, China had to import large quantities of phosphate
fertilizer and byproducts each year.
</P>
<P>
Yet domestic phosphate fertilizer producers used less than 40
percent of their production capacity last year, Zhou observed.
</P>
<P>
The official suggested the government create a fertilizer
reserve system to keep market balance and stabilize prices.
</P>
<P>
China is the second largest fertilizer producer and the largest
consumer in the world.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Eradicate Leprosy by 2000: Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba said today that his government is committed to
eradicating leprosy in the country by 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion of the World Leprosy Day today,
Deuba said that the government has recently initiated a multi-drug
therapy for leprosy patients in all 75 districts of the country in
order to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy is still a public health problem in Nepal and many
victims of the disease hide their illness out of various
superstitions, the prime minister said in the message.
</P>
<P>
He added that because of the lack of awareness, many leprosy
patients in Nepal are afraid of coming forward for treatment and
this fact has placed Nepal in the list of countries with a high
incidence of leprosy in the world.
</P>
<P>
Deuba in his message urged social organizations and workers in
the country to cooperate with the government in raising public
awareness against the disease and bringing out leprosy patients
for regular treatment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nepali Health Minister Arjun Narsing K.C. said today
that the number of leprosy patients in Nepal has now declined to
19,000 from 100,000 about 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said at present six out of 10,000 people in Nepal suffer
from leprosy, adding that the World Health Organization (WHO) has
set a target of limiting the number of leprosy cases to one out of
every 10,000 people by 2000.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Nepali Ruling Party Suffers Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's ruling party suffered
a setback in the by-elections for five vacant seats of the lower
house as the opposition has already secured three of the five
house seats, political analysts here said today.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission announced last night that the Communist
party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), the main
opposition, has won in three constituencies in the by-elections
held Friday in the Country's five constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Results of the by-elections in the other two constituencies
will be announced later due to delay in vote-counting and
rescheduled voting in some polling stations, the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's Nepali Congress (NC) party,
which leads the present three-party coalition government, earlier
had vowed to win all the five vacant seats in the House of
Representatives, or the lower house, in order to replace the
CPN-UML as the largest party in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Friday's house by-elections represented a second serious
setback to Deuba within over one month after his coalition
government was reduced into minority status through a
no-confidence motion by the main opposition party last month,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Under Nepal's constitution, the single largest party in a hung
parliament could form a minority government if efforts to form a
coalition government with majority parliamentary support fails.
</P>
<P>
Since September, 1995, Prime Minister Deuba has always met
challenges from the main opposition, the CPN-UML, which last year
launched two no-confidence attempts to topple his government by
luring away the second ruling partner -- the National Democratic
Party (RPP).
</P>
<P>
The last CPN-UML attempt failed late December as 101 lower
house MPs voted in favor of the opposition sponsored no-confidence
motion, which required a majority vote of 103 to pass in the
205-seat house.
</P>
<P>
However, the house voting showed that the government had lost
majority support in the parliament as only 84 MPs of the house,
which had five vacant seats, voted against the no-confidence
motion.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Deuba would seek a vote of confidence for
his coalition government in the forthcoming winter session of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Before the Friday by-elections, the opposition CPN-UML had 87
seats while the main ruling NC party had 86 seats in the lower
house.
</P>
<P>
With three more opposition seats in the house, the government
is likely to face an even more unstable future as the opposition's
strength in the parliament has definitely increased and it would
step up its efforts to topple the NC-led government, analysts
said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Hopeful of Solution to Tribal Insurgency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
expressed optimism about an end to the two-decade-long insurgency
in the Chittagong hill tracts (CHT) while the peace talks with the
tribal rebel leaders entered the second day here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are heading towards a solution," said chief whip Abu Hasnat
Abdullah, head of the National Committee on CHT, after nearly
four-hour talks Saturday with the leaders of the Parbatya
Chattragram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS), the political wing of
the armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
Shantu Larma, chairman of the PCJSS, also shared the optimism,
"we are optimistic of an early solution. The sooner it will be
done the better will be for all."
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist rebels have been fighting a bush war since 1973
for autonomy of three hill districts in southeast Bangladesh
bordering India and Burma.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the talks were being held on the
basis of the five-point demands put forward earlier by the PCJSS,
which includes regional autonomy, withdrawal of the security
forces from the hill districts and removal of Muslim settlers from
the plains.
</P>
<P>
The government also put forward a set of proposals on PCJSS's
five-point demands.
</P>
<P>
It was the tenth round of talks between the government and the
tribal rebels since a ceasefire on August 1992 halted the bloody
war between the security forces and the armed rebels.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Seeks New Food Safety Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Coming under fire for doing
little to ensure food safety, United States President Bill Clinton
today proposed a budget of 43 million U.S. dollars on a
state-of-the-art warning system against food-borne illness.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a radio address, Clinton said that the budget is
part of the plan he will send to the Congress next month.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
which was strongly criticized for spending less than a third of
its 225 million dollars budget on food safety, plans to use 23
million dollars on a seafood safety program and 20 million on
research of new food pathogens and disease-causing microorganisms.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to modernize the food safety system put in
place at the dawn of the 20th century so that it can meet the
demands of the 21st century," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said new food rules will take effect next week, which
require all meat and poultry plants be tested for E. coli, a
life-threatening ailment.
</P>
<P>
The measures are the first effort by the administration to
update meat safety system in 90 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, 500 people were sickened and four children died after
eating hamburgers contaminated with E. coli bacteria in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said a nationwide early-warning system for food
contamination will be built.
</P>
<P>
About 9,000 people die every year from food poisoning, and nine
millions sickened in the United States.

<P>
The out-competition doping tests for Chinese athletes were
especially taken in two events of track and field and swimming,

RIO DE JANEIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Direct foreign
investment in Brazil reached a record high of 9.4 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, more than doubled that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
About 3.9 billion dollars of foreign investment entered Brazil
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Altamir Lopes, head of the Economic Department of the Central
Bank of Brazil, said this figure shows that investors have
recovered their confidence in Brazil from the economic crisis in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the investment should be mainly attributed to
the privatization policy, which brought the country 2.3 billion
dollars, added Lopes.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted a rosy prospect for the country with direct
foreign investment soaring to 16 billion dollars in 1997.

<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Competition for bonds investors
began last week in a growing capital market and is expected to
increase over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
About 3.5 billion yuan (421 million US dollars) in corporate
bonds issued by the Ministry of Railways went on sale on
Monday. And 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion US dollars) in treasury
bonds, the first batch this year, were floated on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that a long queue in a northern
Beijing securities trading hall was reminiscent of a treasury bond
issuance early last year.
</P>
<P>
"But this time, people were interested in corporate bonds," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted trading hall staff as saying that they sold 20
million yuan (2.4 million US dollars) of railway bonds in one day.
</P>
<P>
However, the popularity of the corporate bonds does not mean a
quick victory for them over the T-bonds, the staff said.
</P>
<P>
Most corporate bond buyers were individuals as expected, while
most T-bond investors reportedly were institutions.
</P>
<P>
Many individual investors did not have access to the T-bonds
because they lack security trading accounts. The accounts were
necessary for this batch of T-bonds.
</P>
<P>
"But competition for individual clients will be inevitable
between T-bonds and corporate bonds later this year," Ren Yongbin,
an official with the China Securities Co. was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chinese investors have become more enthusiastic because of last
year's interest rate cuts and a bustling stock market.

NANJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A 2.56-meter-long ancient red
sandalwood weighing instrument built in 1788 went on public
display recently in the Confucius Temple in Nanjing, the
provincial capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be China's lengthiest weighing device made of
red sandalwood.
</P>
<P>
The ancient instrument was recently discovered by He Qihua, the
chairman of the board of the Jiangsu Han-Tang Artistic Works
Auction House in neighboring Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
With a diameter of 0.07 meters at its largest end, it is
inscribed in silver with the name of the craftsman who made it and
other measurement marks, each representing five kilograms. The
stone sliding weight is 18.3 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The instrument can measure goods weighing between 50 to 180
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that a 500-year-old red sandalwood tree with
a straight trunk measuring at least four meters was needed to
create the instrument. They said the discovery greatly aids the
research of China's weighing instruments from the late Ming
Dynasty (1386-1644) to the early Qing Dynasty (1644 to 1911).

<HEADLINE> North Chinese Port City Seeing More Taiwanese Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of Taiwanese-funded
enterprises in China's port city of Tianjin was 1,177 at the end
of 1996, according to recent statistics from the municipal office
for Taiwan affairs.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that the city approved 111
Taiwanese-financed firms last year, with a total contractual
investment of some 380 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The mainland's stable political and economic situation and the
improved investment environment are the main reasons for the
increase," said Qu Gengshen, director of the office.
</P>
<P>
A regulation Tianjin passed last year clarifies the rights of
Taiwanese investors and the city has set up a special sub-zone for
Taiwanese investors in the Tianjin economic and technologic
development zone.
</P>
<P>
Turnover of the city's Taiwanese-funded enterprises exceeded
five billion yuan (600 million US dollars) last year, with profits
up to 300 million yuan. The export value of these firms reached
more than 300 million US dollars, according to government
statistics.
</P>
<P>
"Cultural and technical exchanges across the straits are more
frequent," Qu noted, adding that the number of Taiwanese students
studying in the city exceeds 100, and 14 college students in
Tianjin went to Taiwan for further study last year.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Local governments in rural
areas of Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province,
have made great efforts in the construction of much-needed water
conservancy projects during the winter months.
</P>
<P>
An official with the municipal government has said that, to
date, the government has spent 260 million yuan and provided 900
sets of equipment to help strengthen the region's 150 kilometers
of dykes and 13 reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
The government has already completed a number of water
conservation plans, including reinforcing anti-flood facilities in
the Liuxihe irrigated area, strengthening dykes along the Pearl
River and building flood-control projects.
</P>
<P>
Such projects are a priority of the municipal government. From
1995 to 1997, three billion yuan was channeled into the work -- 80
percent more than the total amount in the previous 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, Guangzhou has extended and developed 47,000
hectares of irrigated land, and stepped up the prevention of

<HEADLINE> More Bonds to be issued to Finance Key Construction in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to issue more
bonds overseas this year to finance some of its key construction
projects.
</P>
<P>
A national conference on international fund raising next month
would determine the market direction and ways for foreign fund
pooling, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a State Administration of Foreign Exchange official
as saying that domestic financial institutions are encouraged to
pool low-cost funds in the international capital market actively
and steadily while the growth of the national foreign debts will
be still under strict control.
</P>
<P>
Domestic financial institutions issued nine batches of bonds
abroad last year, collecting 1.81 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
This year, the amount is expected to rise moderately, and the
money will be used primarily for key construction projects such as
power and steel plants.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Bank has approval to issue 350 million US
dollars of bonds in the United States in the near future. And the
Bank of China has applied to issue overseas bonds after a two-year
absence from the international market, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The country's four state-owned commercial banks - the Bank of
China, China Construction Bank, the Agricultural Bank of China and
the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China - will probably make a
presence abroad, he added.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank to Readjust Money Tactic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank plans to
place more emphasis on monetary policy than credit scale this
year, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the ceiling for note
issuance this year, which is 120 billion yuan (14.5 billion US
dollars). The figure represents a 13.6 percent growth from 1996.
</P>
<P>
PBOC officials said the previous practice of controlling money
supply through mandatory directions on commercial banks' credit
scale has proven unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
In the next two years, the central bank will transform the
practice into one of self-control under the supervision of the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC's plans to influence money supply include the
following strategies:
</P>
<P>
- Improve the deposit reserve rate.
</P>
<P>
- Expand the trading varieties and quantity on the national
inter-bank market, which will become the top choice in balancing
banks' capital positions.
</P>
<P>
- Develop open-market operations in treasury bonds, the central
bank's financing bonds and government debts.
</P>
<P>
- The interest rate will play a bigger role.
</P>
<P>
- Promote the use of commercial bills and expand bill
acceptance, discount and rediscount.

<HEADLINE> Farmers' Income Up in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province, one of China's
leading grain producers, will produce 43.5 billion kilograms of
grain this year. It will help bring the per capita income of local
farmers in 1997 to 2,500 yuan (301 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the province harvested a record
43.3 billion kg of grain last year, an increase of 850 million kg
over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with output increases of farm produce and the rapid
development of rural industry, local farmers in the province have
seen a big growth in their income over the past years.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that per capita net income of farmers will reach
2,100 yuan (253 U.S. dollars) for 1996, a rise of 400 yuan over
1995.
</P>
<P>
The officials attributed the success in agriculture to the
province's efforts for developing agricultural production, to
guaranteeing a sown area of grain, and to wide application of
scientific achievements.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province has pumped 3.3 billion yuan since
1988 into improving low-yield farmland, and reclaiming wasteland,
which has boosted the province's total grain output by 2.65
billion kg each year.
</P>
<P>
Shandong has a population of 87 million and the per capita
grain availability ratio is 500 kg - 100 kg higher than the
national average.
</P>
<P>
Plenty of grain has laid a good foundation for the province to
develop grain processing and animal husbandry, which has helped
increase the added value of grain.
</P>
<P>
The province has also guided farmers on the development of
sideline production, such as vegetable growing and aquatic
products, to advance its rural industry.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has started 1.7 million rural and township
enterprises, with 14 million employees, accounting for 40 percent
of the province's total rural workforce.
</P>
<P>
Last year, rural industrial enterprises generated 88 million
yuan of output value and contributed 23 percent to the per capita
income of local farmers.

<HEADLINE> Rule on Salary Protection Adopted in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen city in south China's
Guangdong province has adopted China's first rule to protect
workers when their companies are unable to meet wage bills.
</P>
<P>
The rule, which came into force on January 1 this year,
protects laborer's rights on pay, and will help reduce the number
of labor disputes.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates that an insurance foundation will be
set up to lend money to companies in difficulties to meet wage
bills.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the provincial labor department shows that since
the labor law came into effect more than 6,000 cases of labor
disputes have occured, with 80 percent resulting from salary
arrears.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, as one of country's special economic zones and having
taken a lead in the reform and opening-up process in the country,
has seen ever-increasing salary arrears cases.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that salary arrears cases concerning
sum of 11.2 million yuan have been dealt with in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Under the current situation there is no state law on the issue,
so Shenzhen launched a pilot scheme to initiate such a rule based
on the experience of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In October, 1996, the new rule was published in Shenzhen,
clearly defining the terms.

<HEADLINE> Village of Dwarves Can Now Walk Tall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- People in China's "Village of
Dwarves" are toasting an end to a life of looking up at the world.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have finally discovered why so many residents in
Huilong Village, about 50 kilometers from Sichuan's provincial
capital city of Chengdu, are dwarves.
</P>
<P>
And the discovery means that future generations of the rural
people will be able to walk tall.
</P>
<P>
Huilong earned the nickname "Village of Dwarves" because it is
home to 60 vertically-challenged residents, including ten with
heights of just one meter.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have discovered that an excessive amount of mercury
in village drinking water has been the cause of dwarfism. Measures
have been taken to reduce levels of the toxic substance.
</P>
<P>
Experts in endemic disease control and prevention at the
Chinese Academy of Sciences have not found one new case of
dwarfism among villagers since the local government built
facilities to supply pollution-free drinking water.
</P>
<P>
The dwarves, aged 30 to 60, have been able to earn a living,
aided by a local disabled persons' federation and civil affairs
departments.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Develops New Tourism Attractions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guangzhou, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Three major cities in
Guangdong Province in south China are moving the focus of their
tourism industries.
</P>
<P>
Instead of relying on the construction of huge man-made scenic
spots, such as amusement parks, the cities plan to develop
attractions with local features.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, the provincial capital, has rebuilt the main
building of Whampoo Military Academy, which was established by
Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the 1920s, and turned it into an attraction for
tourists who are interested in Chinese Contemporary history.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has also turned busy Shangxiajie Road into a
pedestrian street, where tourists can sample a taste of local
delicacies, shop, and entertain themselves.
</P>
<P>
The street was recently selected as one of the "Ten Major
Beautiful Tourist Scenes".
</P>
<P>
Foshan City, not far from Guangzhou, is a famous historical
city known as a "capital of folk arts". Apart from its ancient
architecture and pottery-making art, the city has renovated Liang
Garden, which is one of the four most famous gardens in Guangdong,
to cater more for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Zhongshan City, which attracts tourists to visit the former
home of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, has not only developed several "walking
culture streets", but also initiated an "agro tour" for tourists
to experience farming and rural scenery typical of the Pearl River
Delta area.

<HEADLINE> Experts Find Origin of Liaohe River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese water conservancy
experts have discovered that Guangtou Hill in north China's Hebei
province is the origin of the Liaohe River, one of China's seven
largest rivers.
</P>
<P>
The Liaohe River does not originate from Xar Moron River, nor
does it have three sources, a team of experts declared. Their view
was that the source of the river is Guangtou hill in Qilaotushan
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
Liaohe River, flowing through Hebei Province, Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, Jilin and Liaoning provinces, is of great
importance to the country.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the river was thought to have three origins,
namely the Laoha River, Xar Moron River and Dongliao River.
</P>
<P>
After detailed investigations of the river's water system, the
expert team, using international standards, found that Guangtou
Hill is the real origin of the Laoha River in its upper reach.
</P>
<P>
According to the team, the Liaohe River should be calculated as
1,394 km-long.

PARIS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian government today
warned the country's press against "the danger of terrorist
propaganda" at the moment when Algeria is faced with an
unprecedented wave of terrorist attacks against its civilians.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports quoted the Algerian Interior Ministry as
saying in a communique that the state "will not tolerate
deviations (by the press) any more."
</P>
<P>
The ministry also accused some newspapers of "amplifying the
number of victims or sometimes even inventing the terrorist acts."
</P>
<P>
The Algerian government denied a report today by the Algerian
evening paper, Le Soir d'Algerie, that 36 civilians were massacred
by terrorists in the region of Tlemcen in western Algeria.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry deplores this regrettable deviation" by some
national newspapers, said the communique.

<HEADLINE> France to Set Up Group on Jewish Assets Robbed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
said today that France will set up a working group very soon to
fully investigate the whereabouts of Jewish assets seized by the
Vichy collaboration regime during the Nazi occupation period from
1940 to 1944.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the group will publish by the end of this
year an inventory on the seized Jewish properties still kept in
the hands of French or foreign public institutions.
</P>
<P>
Attending an annual dinner of the Representative Council of
Jewish Institutions in France, Juppe said that President Jacques
Chirac has agreed to this plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the envisaged group, to be headed by a "high
personality," "could also formulate the proposals on" what
should be done about the Jewish properties.
</P>
<P>
Juppe also expressed his satisfaction over the rejection made
this week by the French supreme court of an appeal by Maurice
Papon, a former Nazi collaborator accused of deporting some 2,000
Jews to Nazi death camps during the occupation period.
</P>
<P>
He said that France wants an agreement of partnership between
the European Union and Israel to come into force as soon as
possible.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Ambassador Rejects US Criticism on Bombing Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's ambassador
has reacted to the U.S. criticism of his government's reluctance
to cooperate in the probe of a truck bombing in Dhahran, saying
results of the investigations should be made exclusively by Saudi
authorities.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan said,
"When all investigative procedures have been thoroughly brought to
a conclusion, the results will be made public by Saudi
authorities."
</P>
<P>
"It would be premature to accuse or absolve anyone until the
investigation is completed," the ambassador added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director
Louis Freeh criticized the government in Riyadh for withholding
important information requested by Freeh about the truck bombing
last June at a U.S. military housing complex in Dhahran, that
killed 19 American servicemen.
</P>
<P>
In response to the criticism, Prince Bandar said his government
must consider security when the investigation was under way
because the security "is important and sensitive. It cannot be
worked out through the media."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador described Saudi-American relations as "strong
and special," and said "close cooperation will continue."
</P>
<P>
"Where there might be a difference on a particular point..., we
sort out the immediate matter through close consultation. Almost
always, we come to an agreement that serves both countries," he
said.

<HEADLINE> France Greets Central Africans' End of Mutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- France today congratulated the
two conflicting parties of the Central African Republic on the
ending of the mutiny, and called on them to "scrupulously respect
the commitments" they made to several African mediating countries.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued today, the French Foreign Ministry
expressed happiness over the signing today in Bangui by Gabonese
President Omar Bongo, who mediated the truce, and his Central
African counterpart, Ange-Felix Patasse, of a declaration on the
ending of the mutiny.
</P>
<P>
French troops stationed in Bangui attacked the rebels on
January 5 after two French military men were killed by the rebels,
who began the mutiny -- the third in the country in eight months
-- on November 15, 1996.
</P>
<P>
France called on the conflicting sides to "pursue the road of
national harmony, the only possible basis for the necessary
efforts for an economic readjustment."
</P>
<P>
France today also paid homage to the heads of state of Mali,
Burkina Faso, Chad and Gabon, the four mediating countries
designated by the Franco-African summit in Ouagadougou in
December, for the efforts they made in finding a solution to the
mutiny.
</P>
<P>
"France is pleased with the success obtained by the chiefs of
state of mediation who have managed to find a peaceful solution to
the crisis touching a friendly African country," the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
The mediation, headed by former head of state of Mali General
Amadou Toumani Toure, also brought about a reconciliation
agreement between the rebels and President Patasse, and a plan to
establish a widely based government of national union.
</P>
<P>
The rebel soldiers announced Thursday that they would stop all
activities in the capital of Bangui and other places.
</P>
<P>
An international follow-up committee will be set up to
supervise the application of the truce while an African
intervention force will be sent to Central Africa with a
half-a-year mandate.
