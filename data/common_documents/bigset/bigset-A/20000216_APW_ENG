<HEADLINE> Female Heart, Geography Link Shown  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Women age 35 and older who live in Mississippi,
New York and West Virginia are more likely to die of heart disease than anywhere
else in the United States, a study concludes.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, based on heart disease death rates between 1991 and 1995, also
found that black women at far greater risk than any other group.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the U.S. heart disease death rate for those years was 401 deaths
per 100,000 women.
</P>
<P>
	   Mississippi had the highest rate at 531 per 100,000 women, followed by New
York and West Virginia. Minnesota women faced the lowest risk at 284 deaths per
100,000, followed by Alaska and Montana.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and West Virginia University. It is aimed at helping health
professionals target women at risk.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rather than having to do a cookie-cutter approach to research, we can focus
on trouble spots," said Lynn Smaha, president of the American Heart Association
and a cardiologist in Sayre, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   Among regions with high rates are Appalachia, the Ohio-Mississippi River
Valley, the Mississippi Delta and the eastern Piedmont and coastal regions of
Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Smaha said possible reasons for the differing death rates include genetic
variations heavily concentrated in a particular region, amount of exercise,
smoking habits, ethnic diets and other social or cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Social isolation and limited mobility also may be part of the problem in
some high-risk areas, the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 25 percent and 40 percent of women living in the high-risk eastern
U.S. regions had limited mobility. In Western states, only about 15 percent of
older women were in such straits.
</P>
<P>
	   Black women fared far worse than any other group, regardless of geography,
with 553 deaths per 100,000. Black women had high death rates in Alabama,
Georgia and South Carolina, as well as in pockets scattered throughout the
Northeast, Midwest and parts of Texas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
	   Among white women, there were 388 deaths per 100,000, compared with 265 for
Hispanic women and 221 for Asian and Pacific Islander women.
</P>
<P>
	   Historically, women and minorities have been ignored in health studies and
fallen into gaps in the health care system.
</P>
<P>
	   "Women and minorities have been lumped in as part of the general population,
but they're different," Smaha said. They have different symptoms, get heart
disease later in life and often receive their information about health in
different ways.
</P>
<P>
	   About 373,000 American women die of heart disease every year -- more than
from all forms of cancer combined, according to the CDC.

<HEADLINE> Celtics 101, Jazz 99  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM KORTE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Kenny Anderson scored 19 of his 33 points in the
fourth quarter as the Celtics beat the Utah Jazz 101-99 on Tuesday night,
Boston's first victory over Utah since Larry Bird's playing days.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Pierce scored 20 and made two free throws with 1:03 remaining to give
the Celtics a 99-96 lead. Anderson hit four free throws in the final 16.4
seconds as Boston snapped a 14-game losing streak to the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
	   The Celtics last beat Utah in 1991-92, Bird's final season. The victory also
was Boston's first in Salt Lake City since January 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Antoine Walker added 19 points for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Malone, well-rested after playing only three minutes in Sunday's
All-Star game, led Utah with 32 points. Howard Eisley added 19, Jeff Hornacek
had 13 and John Stockton scored 12.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz forced a final chance when Bryon Russell, who hit a 3-pointer with
2.9 seconds left, intercepted Boston's inbounds pass and called timeout with two
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell inbounded to Stockton, whose running scoop shot from 10 feet bounced
off the close side of the rim as the horn sounded.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a dramatic fourth quarter, with nine lead changes and four ties. When
Anderson hit two foul shots with 9.9 seconds left, Boston's 101-96 lead seemed
safe until Russell's late efforts came up just short.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams ran hot and cold all night.
</P>
<P>
	   First, the Celtics opened a 22-12 lead after a first quarter in which the
Jazz shot 21 percent (4-of-19). The Jazz came back in the second, using an 18-0
run over a four-minute span to build a 42-33 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah worked hard defensively over that span, holding the Celtics to one
field goal in the last seven minutes of the second quarter: a tip-in by Walter
McCarty with 48.4 seconds before the break.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz led 72-66 after the third quarter but couldn't hold off Anderson,
who made a 3-pointer and added a three-point play to tie it at 77-77 with 7:20
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   After Malone made two free throws, Anderson answered with another 3-pointer
with 6:54 to play and the Celtics led 80-79. When Malone made two free throws to
give Utah a 92-91 lead with 2:56 left, Anderson split two defenders in the lane
for a layup with 2:43 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   It was close the rest of the way, but the game got away from the Jazz when
Malone's pass in the lane to Eisley went awry near the one-minute mark. Pierce
had a key block of Stockton in the final seconds.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Hoops Star Przybilla Ousted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Just a day after being selected Big Ten Player of the
Week, Minnesota center Joel Przybilla was suspended indefinitely from the team
for failing to meet academic requirements, Gophers coach Dan Monson said during
practice Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Monson did not immediately specify what standards Przybilla did not meet,
other than to say the sophomore 7-footer fell short of team rules in several
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Przybilla did not attend practice Tuesday. Monson said the suspension will
last as long as the problem exists.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a definite lack of commitment," Monson said. "There's more than one
thing. But I'm not going to elaborate much more than that. It's an academic
thing. He's got to commit to academics or he's not going to be a part of this."
</P>
<P>
	   Monson said he had previously discussed the problem with Przybilla.
</P>
<P>
	   "He knew that these were the consequences if he didn't meet his team rules
on academics, and he hasn't fulfilled his obligations," Monson said.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked how many warnings Przybilla had received, Monson replied,
"plenty."
</P>
<P>
	   "The decision shouldn't be a surprise for him," Monson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Przybilla was named Big Ten Player of the Week on Monday for a 33-point,
14-rebound effort in the Gophers' upset win against Indiana. The sophomore was
averaging 17 points and 11 rebounds in Big Ten play this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now I think it's disappointing and I think his teammates are
disappointed," Monson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Monson took over in July as coach of the Gophers, inheriting a program that
is under NCAA investigation for allegations of academic fraud. The allegations
cost former coach Clem Haskins his job, as well as resulting in the team being
banned from postseason play this year.
</P>
<P>
	   University officials praised Monson for suspending his star.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is imperative that we send the right message to student-athletes, that
we take academic issues seriously," interim athletic director Tom Moe said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Student-athletes will be held to the standard of students," said Sandra
Gardebring, vice president for university relations. "They have to go to class,
do their homework and get their papers in on time. There is a question of
personal responsibility here."
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Przybilla also missed a practice and a preseason game for what
he called personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   If Przybilla decides to forgo his final two years of college eligibility, he
would be a projected lottery pick in the NBA draft in June.

<HEADLINE> No. 11 Florida 80, Arkansas 71  </HEADLINE>
    By HARRY KING AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Mike Miller had 19 points and Kenyan Weeks made
four straight free throws in the late going as No. 11 Florida beat Arkansas
80-71 in the Southeastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida (19-5 overall, 8-3 Southeastern Conference) was in charge most of
the way after overcoming Arkansas' 8-0 start. The Razorbacks (13-11, 5-6)
finally got going from the outside on two 3-pointers from Charles Tatum and one
from Brandon David, and Alonzo Lane had a dunk to close the margin to 65-59 with
6:19 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Weeks, who has missed only one of 44 free throws this season, hit two with
6:04 to play and two more with 5:50 left as the Gators rebuilt the margin to
double figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkansas once again cut it to six on Joe Johnson's acrobatic leaner on the
baseline with 1:50 left to make it 73-67. Miller hit both ends of the bonus with
1:44 left and Arkansas didn't get closer than eight after that.
</P>
<P>
	   During the first 27 minutes, Arkansas missed 17 of 23 3-point attempts in
falling behind by 10. The Razorbacks finished 9-of-31 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gators led for the final 33 minutes, but early in the half, Johnson
floated down the lane for a basket and Teddy Gipson hit from the corner as
Arkansas cut the lead to four. Miller missed a 3-pointer, but the long rebound
was grabbed by a teammate who gave Miller another chance from almost the same
spot. He made this one and was fouled, completing a four-point play to give
Florida a 47-39 lead. Udonis Haslem's tip-in pushed the lead back to 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Haslem and Weaks scored 13 each. Johnson led Arkansas with 15.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gators committed three turnovers in the first 2:12 and Arkansas built an
8-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Off the bench, Miller provided an immediate spark with a buzzer-beating
3-pointer and a drive down the lane that ended with a finger roll.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida grabbed the lead 14-13 when Blake Eddins' inbounds pass was
deflected and Brett Nelson headed the other way for a 15-foot jumper. Weaks,
14-of-22 from 3-point range against Arkansas the past two years, was good from
the right corner and then the left corner as the Gators went up 20-15. Arkansas
got as close as one, but Justin Hamilton's fancy layup and Brent Wright's basket
widened the lead and it was 37-30 at the half.

<HEADLINE> Jones Switches From Bush to McCain  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Secretary of State Bill Jones, the
highest-ranking Republican official in California, is defecting from the camp of
Texas Gov. George W. Bush to endorse Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain campaign officials said late Tuesday that Jones is switching
allegiances, and called Jones the highest-profile figure in the nation to do so.
Jones scheduled a news conference in Los Angeles for Wednesday morning. McCain
will address the news conference by satellite.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones is expected to stress the Arizona senator's commitment to campaign
finance reform, and his effort to broaden his appeal to independent and
conservative Democratic voters, said a top McCain official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones plans a campaign finance reform ballot initiative for California's
November ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   The official said with Jones on board, several other high-profile
Republicans in California are poised to endorse McCain as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Rob Lapsley, Jones's chief of staff, declined comment Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We regret but respect Bill Jones's change of heart,'' said Gerry Parsky,
Bush's California campaign chairman. ``When George W. Bush secures the
nomination, we will welcome the return of Bill Jones.''
</P>
<P>
	   Margita Thompson, a spokeswoman for Bush, said the defection was
insignificant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Californians are going to respond to Governor Bush's message,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, meanwhile, added a few names Tuesday to his long list of GOP
endorsements in California, including two state senators -- one of whom had
backed Gary Bauer -- and a state assemblyman.

<HEADLINE> Deion Proposes Multiplayer Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Deion Sanders is trying to make a baseball comeback,
but couldn't avoid a football question when he reported to the Cincinnati Reds
training camp.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders has a nonguaranteed Triple-A contract with the Reds. He said Tuesday
he's finished with the Dallas Cowboys "because I want to play with a winner,
with a team that has a chance to make the Super Bowl."
</P>
<P>
	   So his answer was shocking when said he would be willing to play for the
Cincinnati Bengals, who lost more games than any other NFL team in the past
decade. But Sanders has a plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to go to them in a package," he said. "I want to go to them in a
package of players and my agent (Eugene Parker) has a whole squad of players who
are free agents.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told him I want him to be the first agent to give somebody a team
package. We have linemen, we have linebackers, defensive backs ... whatever you
want, we got. We can revamp your whole defense for a small fee, for a feasible
fee," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bengals general manager Mike Brown wasn't biting.
</P>
<P>
	   "My understanding is he is going to try to play for the Cincinnati Reds,"
Brown said. "As far as the part about the Bengals, that's premature. I thought
he is still on the roster (of the Cowboys) so I can't say anything and I'll beg
off that question for the time being."
</P>
<P>
	   Cowboys officials are disappointed by Sanders' decision to play baseball
again. The team is expected to cut Sanders, 32, on June 2 because of his $12.7
million price tag for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders has not played baseball since 1997, when he hit .273 and stole 56
bases with the Reds. He has a .266 lifetime average and 183 stolen bases in 609
major league games.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders played for the New York Yankees in 1989-90, the Atlanta Braves in
1991-93, split the season with the Braves and Reds in '94, split '95 with
Cincinnati and San Francisco and spent '97 with the Reds after sitting out '96.

<HEADLINE> Alert Declared at Nuclear Plant  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM FITZGERALD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) -- A leak in a steam generator at a Hudson River nuclear
power plant resulted in a brief release of radioactive steam Tuesday night but
it was confined to the plant and below dangerous levels, power company officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Con Edison, which owns and operates the Indian Point 2 plant in northern
Westchester County, declared an alert, the second of four increasingly serious
emergency classifications, company spokesman Michael Spall said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no immediate reports of any evacuations.
</P>
<P>
	   The size and duration of the leak had not been measured.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the plant was shut down, but there was ``a momentary release of
radioactive material to the environment, below any level that poses a threat to
the safety of plant personnel or the public.''
</P>
<P>
	   Radioactive steam was released for ``a few seconds,'' but it was held within
the plant's containment building, the sealed concrete building that holds the
reactor, Spall said.
</P>
<P>
	   He described the plant as stable but said the alert would last several hours
overnight as the shutoff reactor is cooled.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident occurred at 7:29 p.m. in a tube used to carry hot, radioactive,
high-pressure water to a pool of cool, non-radioactive water, Spall said. When
the hot water hits the cool water, steam is produced, which turns a turbine and
generates electricity.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal, state and local authorities were notified, Spall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The alert was the first in the plant's 16-year history, Spall said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Mischaracterizes Laws  </HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN WOODWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign finance reform and negative electioneering --
two of the hottest topics in the South Carolina primary -- gave rise to several
misstatements in Tuesday's GOP debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain, who recently swore off negative advertising, repeatedly
denied his campaign was responsible for a flier critical of rival Gov. George W.
Bush, only to say backstage that it could have been from his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not by my campaign,'' he insisted in front of viewers as Bush
brandished it, pointing out that it said: ``Paid for by McCain 2000.'' Later
McCain said: ``That could have been put out last week before we stopped all
ads.''
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Bush, defending his plan to ban soft money from corporations
and unions but not individuals, left the impression that individuals are already
barred from giving huge sums to politics -- which they are not.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain only contributed to the confusion by getting an anecdote wrong about
a large Democratic donor.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, McCain complained about the Texas governor's proposal to
exempt individuals from a ban on soft money, saying nothing would stop a
businessman from writing a $1 million check.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John, there's a thousand-dollar limit,'' Bush protested.
</P>
<P>
	   The $1,000 limit to which Bush referred applies to individual giving to
specific candidates. Individuals can give $20,000 a year to a party to be spent
directly on candidates, and unlimited amounts of money to parties for generic
activities like getting out the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Those unlimited sums are known as soft money, an area of giving that McCain
is proposing to get rid of entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain contributed to the misunderstanding with the way he set up his
challenge of Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   He said businessman Bernard Schwartz ``gave $1 million individually to the
Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
	   Actually, Schwartz gave about $650,000 in federal political contributions
overall in the 1996 campaign, most of it to Democrats, according to Federal
Election Commission records. He gave $1,000 to the Clinton-Gore re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in the debate:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Bush said the Republican Party platform's language calling for a
constitutional amendment banning abortion does not say how such an amendment
should be written.
</P>
<P>
	   He was trying to explain why he supports the platform's call for an abortion
ban when his own position is different: Like McCain, Bush opposes abortion
except in cases of rape, incest and when the woman's life is endangered.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1996 GOP platform reads: ``The unborn child has a fundamental individual
right to life which cannot be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That doesn't permit exceptions,'' said Kathleen Jamieson, dean of the
Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, who has
been monitoring the debates. The exceptions supported by McCain and Bush ``are
infringements,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Women's Soccer League Gets $40M  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- While men's soccer struggles in the United States, women's
soccer is hot.
</P>
<P>
	   Saying it has raised $40 million from cable television companies and has the
support of the U.S. World Cup champions, a group said Tuesday it plans to start
a women's soccer league of 8-10 teams in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Not so fast, Major League Soccer said. It wants in on women's soccer and may
submit a rival plan to the U.S. Soccer Federation.
</P>
<P>
	   "This a breakthrough kind of deal," said John Hendricks, founder of the
Discovery Channel and the force behind the league, to be called Women's United
Soccer Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "People feel," Hendricks said, "there is something very attractive and
enduring that these women have touched deep within the fabric of American
society -- it's not just soccer moms, it's soccer dads and soccer uncles."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the eight investors putting up $5 million each are Time Warner Inc.,
Comcast Corp., Continental Cablevision Inc. and Cox Communications. Each
investor will have the right to operate one or more franchises. They also would
get the local television rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Salaries will average $40,000 for a five-month season starting in April. The
cities will be selected from among a pool of 15 the group is considering, and
the projected average attendance is 6,500.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will be the world's premier league for women's soccer," Mia Hamm, a
star with the women's World Cup champions, said. "One of the things we realized
and have known for a while is how deep the player pool is. The level of
competition is going to be extremely high."
</P>
<P>
	   The USSF probably will designate a Division I women's league within two
months, spokesman Jim Moorhouse said Wednesday. MLS, the men's league that began
in 1996, has been working on a plan for a women's league.
</P>
<P>
	   "The application from the John Hendricks group is further proof that soccer
is booming in the United States," MLS commissioner Don Garber said. "Major
League Soccer supports women's soccer and looks forward to being part of this
exciting development."
</P>
<P>
	   Hendricks said the most difficult task was finding suitable stadiums, a
problem MLS also has had in some markets. MLS, whose growth has been slower than
it originally hoped, averaged 17,406 for regular-season games in 1996, then
14,619, 14,312 and 14,282 from 1997-99.
</P>
<P>
	   "We would like not to see these events held in monstrous NFL stadiums,"
Hendricks said. "We would like to see the development of 15,000-20,000-seat
stadiums for these games. In a lot of the markets, we see the opportunity to
combine with the efforts of men's professional leagues and colleges and
universities who want to upgrade their facilities."
</P>
<P>
	   Tony DiCicco, who resigned as U.S. national team coach last fall, is a WUSA
adviser. The women's players, many of whom led the United States to World Cup
titles in 1991 and 1999, and the Olympic gold medal in 1996, will be part owners
of the league.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a possibility of getting some payback at the end of the day for the
success of the league," Julie Foudy, co-captain of the American World Cup team,
said. "We think one of the greatest assets this team has is we love to get out
in the community and promote and sell. That's what we've been doing our entire
careers."

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics 114, Wizards 85  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM COUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Gary Payton scored a career-high 41 points, including seven
3-pointers, to lead the Seattle SuperSonics to a 114-85 victory over the
Washington Wizards on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wizards suffered their fourth straight loss and 12th consecutive road
defeat. Michael Jordan, Washington's new president of basketball operations, was
not at the Key Arena to watch the Wizards' lackluster performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Payton, who sat out the fourth quarter, shot 14-for-21, including 7-for-12
from 3-point range. The All-Star point guard also had five assists and three
rebounds in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruben Patterson had 14 points for Seattle, while Tracy Murray led Washington
with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Payton, 31, bettered his previous career best of 38 points set in Sacramento
on Feb. 24, 1996. He had 36 in games against Minnesota on Dec. 8 and against the
Los Angeles Lakers on Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Payton's final basket was a 3-pointer with 1:40 left in the third quarter
that gave the Sonics a 94-61 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle coach Paul Westphal played reserves in the final quarter. The Sonics
were ahead 97-65 after three periods.
</P>
<P>
	   Payton opened the game with a pair of 3-pointers in the first 1:20 and
scored 11 of his team's first 19 points as the Sonics took a 19-2 lead. Murray
sank a 3-pointer for Washington's first basket with 5:32 gone, but Payton came
back to make his fourth 3-pointer of the opening quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Payton finished the first period with 18 points on 6-for-7 shooting and had
29 points at halftime when the Sonics held a 64-38 lead. The Wizards cut
Seattle's edge to 12 points with the first three baskets of the second period
before the Sonics came back strongly with their reserves on the floor. Shammond
Williams, who had 12 points, hit two 3-pointers in the second quarter for
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   With the score 50-33 in favor of Seattle, the Sonics scored 10 unanswered
points, including seven by Payton.

<HEADLINE> Westminster Dog Show Opens  </HEADLINE>
   By MARGARET LILLARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Gwen DeMilta's dog wasn't distracted by the noise and the
crowds at the Westminster Kennel Club Show. The Doberman had found something a
lot more interesting: the dried chunks of liver stuffed squirrel-like in
DeMilta's cheeks.
</P>
<P>
	   DeMilta used the meat-in-the-mouth trick to get Trevor's undivided
attention. And Trevor, the nation's top-ranked Doberman pinscher, was positively
hypnotized by the sight.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 2,600 dogs in 156 breeds and varieties competed Monday and Tuesday at
the nation's most prestigious dog competition. But it can be almost as
entertaining to watch the tricks performed by the humans to make their dogs look
their best.
</P>
<P>
	   In the staging area at Madison Square Garden, the air buzzes with the sound
of hair dryers and clippers. Handlers wield squeeze bottles of water and metal
combs to tame last-minute dog hair disasters.
</P>
<P>
	   Long-haired breeds such as poodles, shih tzus and spaniels are kept with
their hair tucked in curlers, pins or even doggy snoods until they head for the
competition ring.
</P>
<P>
	   Even there, handlers primp whenever the judges' backs are turned, using
silver show combs to capture stray hair, or a towel to mop up mastiff slobber.
</P>
<P>
	   When the handlers show off their animals, they match their strides to the
gallop of a Great Dane or the dainty trot of a Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
	   And they console and cajole and bribe their dogs with treats and toys --
anything to draw out the sparkling personality that can set a dog apart from the
pack.
</P>
<P>
	   As DeMilta tried to calm Trevor with liver treats, her daughter had
different tricks to get her own Doberman, Edna, to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ee-ee-EE! Ee-ee-EE!'' Carissa DeMilta squeaked as the dog aimed her pointy
ears at the ceiling. ``Edna! Ee-EE!''
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Trevor won an award of merit, which is similar to an honorable
mention. On Tuesday night, the highest award -- best of show -- was presented to
Samantha, an English springer spaniel owned by Carl Blain and Fran Sunseri of
Sacramento, Calif. Samantha is the 5 1/2-year-old daughter of 1993 top dog
Salilyn's Condor
</P>
<P>
	   The dog handler's guidance is critical at a show like Westminster, where
there are big crowds and lots of distractions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes it's hard if the dog hasn't been here before because it's very
chaotic with the people crowding in,'' 17-year-old Carissa DeMilta said. ``You
have to try to make the dog feel it's doing what it wants to do, trying to keep
its attention away from other things.''
</P>
<P>
	   Liver treats were popular among the Doberman handlers. Carissa DeMilta held
a bit of food in her hand to get Edna's attention. Other handlers flicked bits
ahead of their dogs or waved a treat in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Most avoided Gwen DeMilta's in-the-mouth technique.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a nervous habit,'' said DeMilta, a professional trainer for 22 years
who lives in Downingtown, Pa. ``I need to get to it quick -- don't want it
getting stuck in my pocket. It tastes pretty awful.''

    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Goalkeeper Craig Forrest made five saves Tuesday night
as Canada bolstered its chances of advancing to the Gold Cup quarterfinals by
tying South Korea 0-0 in a Group D match.
</P>
<P>
	   Forrest, who plays for West Ham United of England's Premier League, stopped
shots by Yoo Sang-Chul in the sixth and 84th minutes, Noh Jung-Yoon in the 51st
and Ahn Jung-Whan in the 76th and 81st.

national teams from North and Central America and the Caribbean. The Canadians
opened the tournament by tying Costa Rica 2-2 Sunday in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada would be kept from advancing to Sunday's quarterfinals in San Diego
if Costa Rica and South Korea play to a 3-3 tie in the final Group D first-round
match Thursday night in Los Angeles. Canada also would be eliminated if Costa
Rica and South Korea play to a 2-2 tie and it loses a coin flip.

<HEADLINE> Texas Fugitive Caught in Wyoming  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUSK, Wyo. (AP) -- The search for a Texas survivalist wanted in the killing
of a farmer and the wounding of two officers in Nebraska ended late Tuesday when
the fugitive surrendered at a farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Lannis Moses Jr., accused of shooting two Nebraska police officers
on Saturday and gunning down a farmer on Monday, had outrun authorities in the
hills just over the Nebraska-Wyoming state line.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said Moses was found at a farmhouse where he had surrendered his
gun.
</P>
<P>
	   ''``It sounds like maybe he was cold and tired and ready to give up,'' said
Sgt. Perry Jones of the Wyoming Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
	   Moses, a 31-year-old construction worker, was taken to a hospital for
injuries he suffered in a shootout with Nebraska officers on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   A first-degree murder warrant was issued for Moses on Tuesday, a day after a
western Nebraska farmer was shot to death. Authorities, already searching for
Moses after the shootout Saturday, found Moses in Wyoming on Tuesday afternoon,
but he managed to escape in the remote, hilly area.
</P>
<P>
	   The search had shifted to eastern Wyoming from western Nebraska. In the
Paxton, Neb., area, military helicopters were called in Tuesday and schools
closed as more than 100 state troopers searched for Moses. Paxton is about 150
miles southeast of Lusk.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns declared a state of emergency, which allowed the
guard to use two unarmed Blackhawk helicopters in the search.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmer Robert Sedlacek, 48, was found shot to death near an abandoned
farmhouse eight miles from Paxton. Police believe Moses had been hiding out on
the farm and killed Sedlacek to steal his pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
	   Sedlacek was speaking with his father-in-law, Paul Fisher, on a cell phone
and said he noticed unusual tire tracks on the property, Keith County Attorney
Deborah Gilg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher said his last words with Sedlacek were to warn his son-in-law about
the fugitive. ``I heard him say, `What are you doing here?' and the phone went
dead,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The manhunt started late Saturday when a sheriff's deputy tried to arrest
Moses on Texas charges of theft and evading arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   In a shootout with about two dozen officers who chased him in his truck,
Moses allegedly wounded one in the abdomen and another in the hand. He escaped
into the night on icy rural roads because his pickup had no tail lights, police
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a survivalist. He goes for camping equipment and weapons,'' said Gary
Studebaker, a chief sheriff's deputy in Nocona, Texas. ``Ninety-nine percent of
the time he always runs. He's good at it.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Production Boost Expected  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN ALT POWELL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Gasoline prices, now averaging $1.41 a gallon in the United
States, could stay high into the summer travel season, even if OPEC ministers
boost oil production at their meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because gas inventories are so tight, it will take time to bring
supply in line with demand, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
	   Unhappy with what they're paying at the pump, Americans already are talking
about curtailing their driving just as resorts and other vacation spots are
starting to gear up for summer.
</P>
<P>
	   In Houston on Tuesday, homemaker Lydia Gamos filled up her Honda with gas at
$1.45 a gallon and complained, "It certainly does hit you in the pocket."
</P>
<P>
	   She said she was holding her driving to "just the minimum ... at least until
it gets a little cheaper."
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Fox, 33, manager of a non-profit agency in New York, was filling up at
a midtown Manhattan Amoco station.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's ridiculous at this point," he said. "I do as little driving as
possible because it's so expensive."
</P>
<P>
	   Gasoline prices have been rising steadily since last March, when the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut crude oil production by 7.5
percent, or more than 2 million barrels a day, to try to boost prices that had
fallen to 12-year lows.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears that gas prices will go even higher were raised Monday when the price
of crude oil futures closed at $30.25 a barrel -- topping $30 for the first time
in nine years. The price of crude for delivery in March rose further in early
trading Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but eased later and settled
down at $30.06 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts believe that OPEC will come under increasing pressure -- especially
from industrialized nations such as the United States -- to raise production at
its next meeting in late March.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Diwan, managing director for global oil markets at The Petroleum
Finance Co. in Washington, expects OPEC will increase oil production 1.5 million
to 1.7 million barrels a day. But because inventories at refineries already are
low, "that won't be enough to bring prices down dramatically and change the gas
outlook in the United States."
</P>
<P>
	   He suggests "people better get ready" for national gas prices averaging
$1.60 a gallon before they begin easing.
</P>
<P>
	   Julian Lee, a senior analyst at the London-based Center for Global Energy
Studies, also expects an OPEC production increase, arguing that the cartel
realizes oil has become too dear.
</P>
<P>
	   He points out that oil at $30 a barrel could cause inflation -- and
ultimately economic slowdowns -- in oil-consuming countries. This, in turn, will
dampen oil consumption.
</P>
<P>
	   "OPEC countries do not want to see economic growth slow," Lee said. "They
are looking to produce oil for those countries into the distant future. They
want a balance."
</P>
<P>
	   Michael C. Young, an oil analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown investment
bank in Boston, also expects OPEC ministers to raise production to a level that
would reduce crude oil prices to about $25 a barrel this summer. Still, he
believes gasoline could hit $1.50 before then.
</P>
<P>
	   If OPEC doesn't move, "it's conceivable gasoline prices could go to $1.70,"
Young said.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the problem is that U.S. refineries normally increase production of
gasoline during the first three months of the year in anticipation of higher
demand in the summer. That's not happening this year because the high crude
prices and short supplies have prompted many refiners to cut back operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahead of the OPEC meeting next month, the Clinton administration is starting
to lobby oil producers to boost their output.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson travels to Mexico to
discuss oil prices. He is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, two big
OPEC producers, next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico, though not an OPEC member, has cut back production in sympathy with
the oil cartel. Analysts point out that it is one of the few non-OPEC
oil-producing countries that could quickly raise crude oil output.
</P>
<P>
	   The rise in crude has also pushed up heating oil prices this winter,
prompting the U.S. government to make $200 million in aid available to
low-income families. The average retail price for heating oil has nearly doubled
over the last year to $1.66 per gallon, up from 86 cents in January 1999,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Association.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the Clinton administration has resisted tapping the 580 million
barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help increase the supply and bring down
prices. However, asked about that Tuesday, President Clinton said: "I have not
closed off any options."

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart's 4Q Profits Up 23 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. posted fourth-quarter profits that
were slightly better than expectations, fueled by strong sales growth at its
U.S. superstores and operations abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer earned $1.92 billion, or 43 cents a
share, for the quarter ended Jan. 31, up 23 percent from $1.56 billion, or 35
cents a share, a year ago. That's above the 42 cents a share that analysts' had
forecast.
</P>
<P>
	   Quarterly sales totaled $51.39 billion, an increase of 26 percent over the
$40.79 billion in the same period a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a
year, an industry gauge of performance, rose 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales at its Wal-Mart stores rose 12.6 percent in the quarter, boosted by
gains at its Supercenters, which combine discount and grocery stores. Sales at
its Sam's Club warehouse stores increased 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   International sales gained about 164 percent, fueled by strength in its
Mexican, Canadian, British and Puerto Rican division.
</P>
<P>
	   During the quarter, Wal-Mart named Lee Scott as president and chief
executive officer, replacing David Glass who will remain at the company for a
year as chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott, who was Wal-Mart's chief operating officer and vice chairman, had
been tapped about a year ago to succeed Glass.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, the world's largest retailer, also took some significant steps
during the quarter to beef up its Internet operations.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Wal-Mart teamed up with America Online Inc. to develop an
Internet service provider and offer discounted Web access to people who
currently may not have an affordable phone hookup in towns near its 2,500
stores. The name and price of the ISP have not yet been released.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, the company relaunched www.Walmart.com, which now stocks more
than 600,000 items and offers a wide array of services, such as travel
reservations. It also formed a new Internet company with venture-capital firm
Accel Partners, which will work to enhance the giant retailer's Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   While Wal-Mart continues to outpace most of its rivals with its sharp
growth, there were fears that its pace may slow in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve boosted interest rates four times in the last year to
fend off inflationary pressures -- and may raise rates further. That has raised
concerns that consumer spending may slow in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the real issue affecting all retailers right now," said Jeffrey
Feiner, a retail analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart also said that it will continue aggressively cutting prices, which
the company calls "rollbacks." But such promotions will be more difficult in the
coming year because of high raw material prices, increased labor costs and
strengthening of Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The "rollbacks" have been one of Wal-Mart's key marketing strategies to woo
shoppers into its stores.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Wal-Mart earned $5.58 billion, or $1.25 a share, compared with
$4.43 billion, or 99 cents a share, in 1998. Sales for the year were $165
billion, an increase of 20 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   Its annual results do not include a 4-cent reduction due to a change in
rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission in how Wal-Mart accounts for
membership revenues at its Sam's Club.
</P>
<P>
	   As of Jan. 31, Wal-Mart operated 1,801 Wal-Mart stores, 721 Supercenters,
and 463 Sam's Clubs in the United States. Internationally, the company operated
13 units in Argentina, 14 in Brazil, 166 in Canada, six in China, 95 in Germany,
five in Korea, 462 in Mexico, 15 in Puerto Rico and 232 in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart employs more than 885,000 people in the United States and 255,000
internationally.

<HEADLINE> Gillette May Sell Stationery Units  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM KIRCHOFER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Gillette Co. has been making pens for more than 40 years, but
is now considering getting out of the business.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts say it's about time. They say Gillette's strengths are in
shaving products and batteries, both which are completely disjointed from its
slumping business making Paper Mate, Parker and Waterman pens and Liquid Paper
correction products.
</P>
<P>
	   "It strikes at core competencies. What businesses are you in?" said Ira R.
Weiss, dean of the College of Business Administration at Northeastern
University. "It seems to me that pens are a business to get out of."
</P>
<P>
	   Pens and related products accounted for about 7.5 percent of Gillette's $10
billion in sales last year, but they have been a drag on profits.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fourth quarter, profits fell 89 percent on sales that slumped 17
percent. Stationery sales and profits for the total year fell 13 percent and 83
percent respectively from 1998 levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Gillette confirmed that it has retained Merrill Lynch to
assist in a review of its alternatives for the stationery business. The company
will only say a decision will be made "early this year."
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking at several options. Divestiture is one of those options,
spinning it off is an option, as is retaining it," said Eric A. Kraus, the
company's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Gillette also makes lines of toiletries, and it owns Duracell batteries and
the Oral-B brand of dental care products. The company makes Braun household
products which have also been faltering of late, and some followers of the
company have suggested that line should be disposed of as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The battery business is currently one of the strongest elements in
Gillette's portfolio, while the personal hygiene products at least have some
marketing and distribution similarities with Gillette's market-dominating razors
and blades.
</P>
<P>
	   But pens -- especially the deluxe Waterman and Parker brands -- have a hard
time fitting in with such a stable of products, said Fredric E. Russell, head of
Fredric E. Russell Investment Management Co., a Tulsa, Okla., money management
firm that has stock in Gillette.
</P>
<P>
	   "When people think of consuming blades, they also think of consuming on the
same shopping trips toothpaste and things like that, but not pens," Russell
said. "These are very good, smart strategic moves to sell off the stationery."
</P>
<P>
	   Russell said it was not clear how much of a premium the stationery business
would fetch.
</P>
<P>
	   "They may not get a fire sale price, but they're not going to get a price
driven by euphoria either," he said. "They're not selling at the peak, but they
are making a good decision."
</P>
<P>
	   Gillette got into the stationery business in 1955 when it bought the Paper
Mate brand. Liquid Paper correction fluid was added in 1979, and the company
bought the Waterman pen maker in 1987 and the Parker pen brand in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Gillette shares have fallen more than 40 percent from off their March 1999
52-week high, but Weiss thought selling off the stationery business would put
Gillette on the road to reconciliation with Wall Street.

<P>
	   "Clearly the stockholders on Wall Street are not looking favorably on them,
although Gillette has been the star for ages for ongoing continued growth,"
Weiss said. "The street is going to look kindly at getting rid of those pens.
You're getting rid of a drag on profits."

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bank of New York Exec Surrenders  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Bank of New York executive and her husband who
allegedly played a central role in a massive money laundering scandal have
surrendered to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   The former executive, Lucy Edwards, and her husband, Peter Berlin,
accompanied by lawyers, turned themselves in Tuesday after arriving in the
United States from London, according to a source familiar with the investigation
who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   They were expected to plead guilty this morning to money laundering charges
in a plea deal with federal prosecutors, the source said.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal indictment portrayed them as key players in illegally moving as
much as $10 billion from Russia through accounts at the Bank of New York, the
nation's 16th largest bank. Investigators believe most of the laundered money
came from Russian importers trying to avoid paying taxes, though they are still
looking into whether some of the money came from criminal activity and was
transferred through accounts at the Bank of New York in order to mask its
origin.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have said that Edwards, as head of the bank's Eastern European
operations in London, had easy access to bank accounts to engage in money
laundering, whereby crime proceeds are moved through a series of bank accounts
until they appear to be legitimate profits from legal businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards was dismissed from her job Aug. 18 after her name arose as a target
of an investigation that stretched across the globe. She was accused by the bank
of gross misconduct, violation of the bank's internal policies, falsification of
bank records and failure to cooperate with the bank's investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Her husband was targeted by investigators after it was suspected that the
majority of the billions of dollars at stake were moved through a company he
controlled, Benex Worldwide Ltd., and other accounts in his name.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators alleged they found nine accounts at the Bank of New York
connected to Berlin or Benex.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Berlin and Edwards, together with their partner Aleskey Volkov, were
charged by U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White in Manhattan with conspiring to operate a
wire-transfer business. Volkov remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
	   All three have denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges came in September, just a few months after Edwards made a
presentation on the latest money laundering techniques at a two-day conference
for financial executives in Riga, Latvia. Her speech was entitled "Money
Laundering: Latest Developments and Regulations."
</P>
<P>
	   In their indictment, prosecutors alleged that Edwards and Berlin conspired
from 1996 to last August to illegally transmit funds and receive deposits
without obtaining authorization from any federal or state banking agency.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted of those charges, Edwards would face a maximum prison term of
five years and a maximum fine of $250,000 or twice the gain or loss resulting
from the crime.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the conspiracy charge, Berlin and Volkov face charges of
conducting an illegal money-transfering business and engaging in an illegal
banking operation. If convicted, they could face up to 15 years in prison and a
fine of $175,000 or twice the gain or loss resulting from the crime.
</P>
<P>
	   A message left with the couple's lawyers Tuesday was not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan,
declined to comment as did a spokesman for the FBI in New York, which is
conducting the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bank of New York, the nation's 15th largest, also declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Anti-smoking Ads Pulled Over Taste  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The organization behind the biggest U.S. anti-smoking
campaign is going to be watched by critics and fans to see if it has lost its
nerve after pulling two of its first four commercials amid complaints the ads
went too far.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Legacy Foundation withdrew the ads to defuse a potentially
distracting debate over whether the ads amounted to an improper personal attack
on tobacco companies or were an arresting way to educate teens about smoking's
risks.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the pulled ads showed young people stacking "body bags" on the
sidewalk outside a tobacco company building, while the other showed teens
equipped with a lie detector trying to get into a tobacco company's offices to
quiz sales executives about whether smoking was addictive.
</P>
<P>
	   The building was not specifically identified in either ad but the
commercials were filmed inside and outside the Philip Morris Cos. headquarters
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris, the world's biggest cigarette maker, and some state attorneys
general cried foul and the CBS television network refused to run the two ads.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is obvious we pushed a number of buttons and we are going to keep
pushing buttons," Cheryl Healton, president and chief executive of the
foundation, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said the foundation's board voted Monday to withdraw the two ads
temporarily after "concerns were raised from a variety of sectors" and
addressing the controversy threatened to divert her from her main mission of
reducing youth smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads are part of a $1.5 billion anti-smoking campaign being financed with
proceeds from the industry's huge 1998 settlement with the states over claims
for reimbursement for treating sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
	   The foundation was created to oversee the antismoking advertising and
educational efforts, and last week it began running its first commercials
developed by a team of agencies led by Arnold Communications of Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The "Body Bag" ad ran on the USA network while "Lie Detector" ran on the
cable channel Comedy Central.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully this is a one-time incident in which the tobacco companies
demonstrate that they haven't really changed by threatening the foundation
whenever it produces hard-hitting ads that put the tobacco industry in a bad
light," said tobacco critic Matthew Myers, head of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free
Kids.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the foundation's overall campaign is still hard-hitting but added
the "critical point" will be to measure if the foundation continues in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
	   The other two initial ads are parodies of soft drink and sneaker
commercials, showing one of three product users being unexpectedly vaporized.
The message: "Only one product actually kills a third of the people who use it.
Tobacco." Other ads are expected to start running soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was not worth being distracted by one or two ads with others in the
arsenal," Attorney General Christine Gregoire of Washington, who led the states
in the negotiations with the tobacco industry and chairs the American Legacy
Foundation, said Tuesday through a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris, the maker of the top-selling brand Marlboro, had said last
week that it was disappointed with the "Lie Detector" commercial and the Web
site created for the anti-smoking campaign and said it was weighing its options.
</P>
<P>
	   It noted that the state settlement agreement specified that the fund
wouldn't be used for personal attacks on an individual or company, and said
Tuesday it was pleased the two ads had been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Michael F. Easley of North Carolina, who was among the
state negotiators during the tobacco talks, said last week in a letter
distributed to the attorneys general who signed the agreement there was little
question that the ads "can be fairly viewed as personally attacking or vilifying
the tobacco companies, something that all of us who sat around the negotiating
table in New York agreed we would not do."
</P>
<P>
	   The CBS television network refused to run the "Lie Detector" and "Body Bag"
ads because "we feel they crossed the line," CBS spokesman Dana McLintock said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The foundation remains in negotiations with CBS and other networks about
taking its other ads, Healton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris spokesman Brendan McCormick said the company continues to
consider its options on the Web site, which is at www.thetruth.com.

Texas Fugitive Caught in Wyoming

<P>
	   LUSK, Wyo. (AP) -- The search for a Texas survivalist wanted in the killing
of a farmer and the wounding of two officers in Nebraska ended late Tuesday when
the fugitive surrendered at a farmhouse. Charles Lannis Moses Jr., accused of
shooting two Nebraska police officers on Saturday and gunning down a farmer on
Monday, had outrun authorities in the hills just over the Nebraska-Wyoming state
line. Authorities said Moses was found at a farmhouse where he had surrendered
his gun. ""It sounds like maybe he was cold and tired and ready to give up,"

	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- In their final clash before the pivotal South

and South Carolina shapes up as a pivotal test for the two men. The state votes
on Saturday, and recent polls point to a close contest. Bush runs strongly among

Private Co. To Help Keep Mir Alive
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- A Bermuda-registered company said Tuesday it has reached an
agreement to lease Russia's Mir space station in a last-ditch effort to keep the
orbiting platform alive. MirCorp, which was formed in December, already has paid
$20 million to $30 million to the station to keep it up in space at least
through the summer, said its president, Jeffrey Manber. He said another $40
million would need to be raised to keep the station afloat through the end of
the year and beyond. Mir has been flying without a crew since August, and
heavily indebted Russia had said it would abandon the station next month unless
private investors came up with funding.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Takes on War Crimes  </HEADLINE>
   By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Judge Patricia Wald saw her fair share of
strife through 20 years of high-profile litigation at the federal appeals court
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Her cases dealt with Kenneth Starr's alleged grand jury leaks to the press,
former White House aide Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra felony conviction, the
Microsoft antitrust suit, and a series of proceedings arising from the Watergate
scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   But when her first trial at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal gets under way
later this month, Wald will have to grapple with accusations of systematic rape,
torture and massacres committed as part of the bloody ``ethnic cleansing''
campaigns in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some of my friends said: 'You're going from one war tribunal to
another,''' she recalled Tuesday in an interview with The Associated Press in
her office at the U.N. court.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribunal was set up seven years ago by the U.N. Security Council to
prosecute suspected war criminals from the conflicts that followed the
fragmentation of Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Wald joined the 14-judge court in November, succeeding Gabrielle Kirk
McDonald, who returned to the United States after six years on the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   A Connecticut native and Yale Law School graduate, Wald has practiced law
since 1952. In 1979, President Carter appointed her to the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the occasional lighthearted remark, Wald describes her mission here
with utmost seriousness. Nothing less than the promise of universal human rights
protection, enshrined in international treaties, is at stake, she believes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If all of the Hague conventions and Geneva conventions are really going to
mean anything, there has to be some kind of enforcement mechanism,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her first war crimes trial, scheduled to begin Feb. 28, will be the case of
Miroslav Kvocka and several other alleged commanders and guards of the Omarska,
Keraterm and Trnopolje prison camps in northwestern Bosnia, where inmates were
raped, tortured, beaten and murdered.
</P>
<P>
	   As one of the tribunal's two female judges, she said she can bring a
different perspective to the trials, much in the same way she did in sex
discrimination suits at the federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there are some cases, and they don't always have to be sex
discrimination cases, where your particular insights or particular experience as
a woman will add something or will give you a different lens through which to
see the case,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But, she added, ``all the members of the court are sensitized to this whole
aspect of the particular unique abuses that women often suffer when they get
caught in the middle of one of these turmoils. It's an added aspect of
endangerment for them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like many judges and legal experts, Wald sees the Yugoslav tribunal as a
precursor to a permanent international court with jurisdiction to punish
perpetrators of atrocities anywhere in the world. The United States was one of
the few countries to oppose the International Criminal Court when its proposed
statute was drafted at a 1998 conference in Rome.
</P>
<P>
	   Wald understands why some Americans might find it ``a little scary'' that,
at least in theory, U.S. servicemen accused of abuses could be hauled before the
proposed court.
</P>
<P>
	   But she feels the Clinton administration and vehement opponents of the
court, such as South Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms, exaggerate the potential for
political vendettas against the United States or American soldiers, ``unless
they really did commit something terribly bad.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``These tribunals are so busy, believe me, they're not going to go looking
for somebody who's really on the margins,'' she said. ``And the fact that
they're international tribunals means they can't be dominated by some nation
that's mad at the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Vets Bemoan Overweight Pets  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID CRARY AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The experts recommend more exercise, low-fat diets and
fewer snacks. It can be tough medicine for doting pet owners, let alone for
their overweight pets.
</P>
<P>
	   Fat cats may be celebrities in comic strips, but real-life obesity among
America's cats -- and dogs -- is no joke. Veterinarians consider it the leading
health problem, affecting an estimated 30 percent of cats and dogs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our dogs and cats are eating themselves to death,'' warns Evan Kirk of the
Brewer Animal Hospital in Springfield, Ill. ``Their lifespan is short enough
already, without making them even shorter by allowing obesity to occur.''
</P>
<P>
	   To meet the threat, pet-food manufacturers offer diet products almost as
diverse as those for humans. One company produces Norwegian kelp for dogs;
others promote ``holistic dog food'' that combines grains, vegetables, fruits
and herbal supplements.
</P>
<P>
	   Julie Churchill operates a weight-loss clinic at the University of
Minnesota's College of Veterinary Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The average American dog these days is a couch potato,'' she says. ``Our
mental concept of a healthy puppy is a roly-poly overweight puppy.''
</P>
<P>
	   She advises owners to reduce the quantity and richness of treats they offer
their pets.
</P>
<P>
	   Some cat owners seem blase about their pet's waistline, according to a
survey released last week by Ralston Purina, the pet food company.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly half the 577 owners didn't know how to determine if their cat was too
fat. About 40 percent of those who admitted owning a fat cat also said they were
doing nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Veterinarians say it's simple to recognize too much weight: Pets will have
lost that hourglass waist, and it will be difficult to feel their ribs.
</P>
<P>
	   Kirk identifies overweight pets as ``gluttons'' who never seem to get enough
and ``easy keepers'' who eat more moderately but have a slow metabolism.
</P>
<P>
	   Sedentary people tend to have sedentary pets, Kirk says, and owners who
enjoy high-calorie diets tend to pamper their pets with high-calorie treats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pets can have a lot of control over their owners,'' he says. ``When people
feed their pet, they see the response, and it makes them feel good.''
</P>
<P>
	   New York City publicist Erica Fineberg says only one of her cats really
needs to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He does get his exercise, though,'' Fineberg says of Jack, a 20-pound
Mancoon. ``My other two cats chase him because he's always after their food.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Gaithersburg, Md., Betty, a yellow Labrador, lost 15 pounds following a
veterinarian's recommendation. Owner Bill Deller's regimen for Betty included
daily two-mile runs and a switch from canned to dry dog food.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She wouldn't eat it at first -- she was looking for more,'' he says. ``But
it was either that or not eat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like overweight humans, obese pets are vulnerable to health problems:
diabetes, arthritis, and skin, heart or urinary tract diseases. Especially prone
to obesity are spayed pets, and those living in apartments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's humanly impossible for most dog owners to exercise a dog the way they
need to be,'' says Randy Klein, co-owner of a pet health-food store in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
	   She adds that even regular pet food can keep a pet trim.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not so much what people are feeding their pets as how,'' she says.
``A lot of people are leaving food in their bowls all day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Experts say pet obesity worsens as food gets tastier and busy owners grow
lax. With dogs, exercise can be increased through longer or more frequent walks.
</P>
<P>
	   Cats are less likely to embrace such a program, but some enjoy strenuous
play, and others can learn to walk on a leash.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The earlier you start, the easier,'' says Churchill, who takes one of her
cats on walks. ``Trying to teach an old, obese cat to walk on a leash is pretty
tricky.''

<HEADLINE> North Korea Uneasy on Tourists  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHANGJON, North Korea (AP) -- An American sightseer strays too close to the
edge of a fenced tourist compound. A North Korean soldier blows a whistle and
raises a red flag in warning. The American retreats.
</P>
<P>
	   Tourism is an uneasy affair in North Korea, where the communist leadership
has sealed off its people from outside influence for half a century and remains
deeply suspicious of the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the impoverished regime tolerates a daily invasion of hundreds of
foreign tourists, mostly South Koreans, who disembark from cruise ships at the
eastern port of Changjon and climb a scenic mountain.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Koreans treat visitors as potential contaminants: Fences topped
with barbed wire line the roads where the convoy of tourist buses travel,
soldiers stand guard every few hundred yards along the route.
</P>
<P>
	   Tour groups sleep on their ship at night. They drive into a town, Onjung-ri,
but cannot leave a rest center and spa surrounded by high metal sheet fences. No
North Koreans work in the facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The bus drivers are Chinese of ethnic Korean origin. One cheerfully lectured
passengers on how communism is a fair system because everybody gets the same
amount of food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
	   Cash-hungry Pyongyang gets $8 million a month for trips by three cruise
ships from the South Korean conglomerate Hyundai, which launched the $942
million project in late 1998 but has yet to make a profit. Some 180,000 people
have traveled to Changjon.
</P>
<P>
	   The heavily political venture aligns with South Korea's efforts to foster
friendship with the nation that it fought in the 1950-1953 war on the Korean
peninsula. Today the two countries are locked in the world's last Cold War-era
standoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Rules are plentiful. No carrying of South Korean currency. No filming or
photographs of North Korean guides, soldiers or scenery while riding in the bus.
Authorities levy fines of $10 or $50 or higher and occasionally confiscate
cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   One South Korean was fined recently for handing a chocolate bar to a North
Korean child. Pyongyang likely views such a gesture as a dangerous enticement in
a nation of 22 million people where food is scarce.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea said 220,000 people died from famine caused by heavy flooding,
drought and economic mismanagement in the late 1990s. U.S. and South Korean
officials put the figure as high as 2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea can't hide the poverty -- the lack of cars and electricity, the
bleak dwellings -- from tourists peering out of bus windows, but is keen to
portray a positive image.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Korean female guides posted on the path up Diamond Mountain are
chubby and round-faced with wavy hair, a beauty concept that disappeared in the
South many years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Communist Party cadres wear a dab of lipstick, a luxury in a country
that relies on outside food aid. The faces of many male guides are rugged and
darkened by exposure to sun and wind.
</P>
<P>
	   If approached, they chat amiably about the weather or the scenery, but
politics are out. Late last year, South Korea suspended the tours for 40 days
after North Korea accused a South Korean tourist of tempting a guide to defect
and held her for six days.
</P>
<P>
	   The guides show no animosity when told that a visitor is from the United
States, a nation that North Korea's propaganda machine routinely excoriates as
the ultimate symbol of imperialist warmongering. Currently the two countries are
engaged in dialogue.
</P>
<P>
	   One North Korean caught up with an American on a trail and asked through a
South Korean interpreter how Diamond Mountain compared to the Grand Canyon. Then
she asked: ``What are the seven wonders of the world?''
</P>
<P>
	   Many South Koreans visit the North because they are curious about people
with whom they share a common history but who chose such a radically different
political path. Some, separated from family members in the North, are wistful.
</P>
<P>
	   Other South Koreans stay at home, suspicious of a country that invaded the
South in 1950, tunneled under the demilitarized zone separating the two sides,
tried to assassinate a South Korean president at least twice and threatened to
test a long-range missile last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I won't go there because I don't want my money, even a small amount, to be
used for a bomb which may fall on my head some day,'' said Shim Yong, owner of a
trading company in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
	   The tourists paid up to $30 to clap and gape at acrobats from an elite
Pyongyang circus in a dome-shaped theater built by Hyundai. Some paid another
$19 to buy a videotape of the event. Only U.S. currency is accepted.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, the performers unfurled a banner that read ``One,'' a
reference to the stated goal of both Koreas to reunify. Later, a clown warmly
embraced a spectator on stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Nighttime entertainment was more lowbrow on the cruise ships, where tourists
packed lounge couches to watch Siberian dancers in sequined bikinis and plumage
strut the stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite their aloofness, some North Korean hosts betrayed curiosity. At
Changjon, an immigration official stamped the visa of a departing American, then
called him back to ask about lucky and unlucky numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans like seven and they don't like 13, is that right?'' the official
said in English.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes,'' the American replied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Thank you,'' the North Korean said, curtly closing the conversation.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Celebrates Kim's Birthday  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- As North Korea celebrated leader Kim Jong Il's
birthday today, U.S. and South Korean troops prepared to stage a large-scale
joint military exercise against a possible invasion from the North.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korean officials believe that Kim, who turned 58 today, is in firm
control of the communist country and its 1.1 million-member military, the
world's fifth largest.
</P>
<P>
	   That seemed evident during the celebrations, which included a military
statement of support, mass rallies, sports contests, art exhibitions, and poetry
composed in the leader's honor, the North's foreign news outlet, KCNA, said. The
highlight was to be marches by thousands of soldiers, students and workers to
Kim's birthplace at Mount Paektu on the border with China.
</P>
<P>
	   Top military officials, including Gen. Kim Il Cho, minister of the North's
People's Armed Forces, gathered at the leader's birthplace and vowed loyalty to
him, the KCNA said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All the officers and men of the (military) should absolutely worship and
follow only the respected supreme commander, be human bombs and suicide bombers
to defend (him),'' the KCNA quoted the officials as saying in a resolution.
</P>
<P>
	   In communism's first dynastic succession, Kim Jong Il inherited power from
his late father, President Kim Il Sung, who died in 1994 at age 82.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no sign that Kim Jong Il's grip on power is slipping,'' South
Korea's Unification Ministry said in a policy paper this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim Jong Il is generally viewed in the West as a danger, possibly armed with
nuclear bombs. He also is believed to have missiles capable of reaching Hawaii
and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   In a rare positive assessment, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, last
week described Kim Jong Il as ``a leader with considerable judgment and
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
	   The assessment, in an interview with Japanese TV, was viewed as an effort by
Kim Dae-jung to set up a summit meeting with the North Korean leader. Since the
division of their peninsula in 1945, the heads of the rival Koreas have never
met.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the comment touched off anti-government protests in South
Korea, and the conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper called the comment
``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lately, North Korea appears to have begun reaching out to the West. It is
engaged in a dialogue with the United States and has opened relations with
Italy. In a move that appeared to be timed with the birthday, North Korea opened
a consulate in Hong Kong today, Seoul officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, U.S. and South Korean troops, braving wintry weather, prepared to
hold their first joint night air assault drills in South Korea today.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking part in the one-day exercise were 350 South Korean troops, assisted
by 36 U.S. and South Korean assault helicopters. The number of U.S. troops
involved was not known.
</P>
<P>
	   Yoon Il-young, a spokesman for Seoul's Defense Ministry, denied the drills
were timed to coincide with Kim Jong Il's birthday. He said it was just one of
the many joint military exercises held by the allies annually.
</P>
<P>
	   The North often criticizes such exercises as signs of aggression.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States fought on South Korea's side in the 1950-53 Korean War.
Today, about 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a defense
treaty.

<HEADLINE> Nazi War Criminal Indictment Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN C. JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Latvian prosecutors are hoping a meeting here of Nazi
investigators from around the world will produce enough evidence to indict
alleged Nazi war criminal Konrads Kalejs.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials want to see Kalejs returned from Australia to stand trial in
Latvia, where he is alleged to have committed his crimes during the 1941-44 Nazi
occupation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Latvia is ready to take over this investigation,'' Dzintra Subrovska,
spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office, said Tuesday. ``We simply need the
other countries to hand over every bit of evidence they have.''
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators from the United States, Canada, Australia, Great Britain and
Germany at the conference today in the Latvian capital would have the chance to
turn over any evidence they have on Kalejs, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jewish groups say the Latvian-born Kalejs, 86, was a lieutenant in the Arajs
Kommando, a notorious Nazi-sponsored death squad staffed mainly by Latvians. The
unit is said to have murdered some 30,000 Latvian Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs has said he was ordered by German officers to head an Arajs Komomando
unit but denied being present when civilians were shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Jewish groups have pressured Latvia to extradite Kalejs for trial since Nazi
hunters found him in a retirement home in Britain. Kalejs, who was deported from
the United States and Canada in the 1990s for lying about his wartime record,
fled Britain to Australia, where he has had citizenship since 1957.
</P>
<P>
	   In total, 80,000 Jews perished during the Nazi occupation, most within the
first year of German rule. Germans planned and ordered the massacres but Latvian
Nazis often carried out the actual killings.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say they do not yet have enough proof to charge Kalejs. Latvian
prosecutors are seeking witnesses who may have seen Kalejs commit war crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago, the Simon Wiesenthal Center provided Latvian officials with
the names of seven former Arajs men who could testify against Kalejs.
</P>
<P>
	   One of them, Arnis Upmalis, 79, was a guard in the Arajs Kommando. In an
interview at his Riga apartment, Upmalis said he never saw Kalejs kill anyone
but recalled seeing Kalejs in 1943 at the Arajs headquarters in Riga where
Germans planned mass killings of Latvian Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   Upmalis, describing his own role in the Arajs unit, said he had helped
deliver Jews to woods outside the city and stood guard while victims were shot
to death in mass graves. He spent eight years in a Soviet prison for Nazi war
crimes but he said he never hit the people he was guarding or directly
participated in executions.
</P>
<P>
	   Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem, said
the testimony of men like Upmalis could be key in attempts to prosecute Kalejs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only way you will get a guy like Kalejs is to have his fellow
perpetrators tell the truth about what happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wiesenthal Center and other Jewish groups have criticized Latvia for not
showing enough initiative in pursuing Nazi war criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   After regaining independence from Moscow following the 1991 Soviet collapse,
Latvia promised to pursue and prosecute alleged agents of Nazi- and
Stalinist-era crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Latvia has indicted or convicted nearly a dozen men for Stalinist
crimes, mainly for participating in mass deportations to Siberia, no alleged
Nazis have been tried.

<HEADLINE> France Proposes New Maritime Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has set out a list of proposals
aimed at tightening rules governing maritime transport in Europe, including
refusing to allow vessels deemed dangerous to dock at European ports.
</P>
<P>
	   Two months after an aging tanker sank off northwestern France, polluting the
Atlantic and the French coast, Jospin said Tuesday that the environment should
take precedence over financial gain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The preservation of a healthy environment, of the rights of those who work
at sea and of those who live from its resources should take precedence over
mercantile interests,'' Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jospin proposed that vessels transporting dangerous materials receive prior
authorization before entering European ports. Entry could be refused, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   France has also proposed rigorous controls at European ports, with a
Europe-wide system overseeing security measures.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, it has called for increasing indemnities from the current $181
million to $984 million for oil spills, in part through a tax that would
penalize oil importers using unfit tankers.
</P>
<P>
	   The French proposals are to be debated at a March 28 Council of Ministers
meeting in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
	   French maritime transport operators signed a charter Thursday aimed at
tightening security on Europe's sea routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot said that charter opened ``a new era
of responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among the 18 commitments in the charter, oil companies agreed not to use
ships with single hulls starting in 2008 -- a point Jospin incorporated in his
Europe-wide proposals. Ship owners promised to thoroughly examine ships older
than 15 years every 2 1/2 years. At present, they are only obliged to carry out
such an examination every five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
    SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Rodney Rogers came off the bench to score a
career-high 36 points Tuesday night as the Phoenix Suns defeated the Sacramento
Kings 117-108.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the fourth straight victory for the Suns, who have won six of seven
games. Sacramento had won 11 of its previous 12 home games.
</P>
<P>
	   Rogers ignited a 15-2 run late in the second quarter when Phoenix took the
lead for good. He had three 3-point baskets, shot 14-of-19 from the field and
5-for-5 at the line. The Suns made their first 21 free throws and finished
22-of-23.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Gugliotta scored 18 points and Cliff Robinson had 16 points for the
Suns. Penny Hardaway had 14 points and Jason Kidd added eight points, 11 assists
and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Webber led Sacramento with 27 points, nine rebounds and six assists.
Nick Anderson scored 15 points and Jason Williams added 15 points and seven
assists for the Kings, who trailed 63-58 at the half and never got their deficit
below five points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of Rogers and nearly perfect free throw shooting kept the Suns
in control through much of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   After a huge first half, Rogers continued to bother the Kings in the third
quarter. He made three 3-pointers and scored 11 points as the Suns took a 90-86
lead into the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
	   In an entertaining first half, Rogers scored nine points in a 15-2 run late
in the second period, helping the Suns take a 63-58 lead at the break.
</P>
<P>
	   Rogers scored 17 first-half points, Gugliotta had 12 and Kidd contributed
seven points and nine assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Webber had 14 first-half points for the Kings and and Darrick Martin scored
all 11 of his points in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Ailing Baby Donkey Gets Help  </HEADLINE>
   By JULIE GOODMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) -- Though she's sporting a new pair of shoes, Dorito
the donkey isn't trying to make a fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The 8-month-old Sicilian donkey needs the special shoes to correct a
condition that could leave her unable to walk.
</P>
<P>
	   Dorito likely will need surgery, but her farm, which cares for mostly
donated animals, operates on a limited city budget -- one that doesn't allow for
the $675 operation.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dorito is in luck. Lured by the donkey's puff of bangs and squeaky
youthful bray, the Pawtucket 4-H City Slickers held a weekend Valentine's Day
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
	   The 4-H raised $900, with part of the money slated for Daggett Farm's ``sick
animal fund.'' Group members say they hope Dorito can get the operation on her
hooves to lead a normal life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was a little sad and stuff, so I was hoping we could raise enough money
so that she could have the surgery,'' said Kelsey Lind, a 13-year-old 4-H troop
member.
</P>
<P>
	   The 4-H club cares for the farm's animals each weekend, and even named the
donkey.
</P>
<P>
	   When they learned her condition, the club's president, Anita Whalen, decided
to organize a Valentine's Day theme dance. The group ran a notice in the local
paper and sold tickets to family and friends.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some people laughed at me, seriously, when I said, 'Do you want to go to a
donkey dance?''' said Whalen, who is 18.
</P>
<P>
	   The dance, held Saturday, featured a deejay and a cake with Dorito depicted
in frosting.
</P>
<P>
	   Dorito's condition was discovered recently when her caretaker, Tamera
Emmett, noticed something wrong with the donkey's hooves and called a
blacksmith.
</P>
<P>
	   It turns out Dorito was suffering from something called ``knuckling over,''
a condition that causes tendons in the legs to contract and the hooves to grow
at an upright angle. Eventually, she'll be walking on her ``knuckles,'' wearing
down the skin and raising the risk of infection. If left untreated, she won't be
able to walk.
</P>
<P>
	   The blacksmith strapped on some specially-made shoes, but Emmett knows
surgery likely will be needed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was trying to kind of buy us some time and pray that it works,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The veterinarian, E.J. Finocchio of New England Horse Care Center, says the
surgery is a simple procedure he would perform at a discount to reward the 4-H
troop.
</P>
<P>
	   Emmett said people were drawn by Dorito's charm. She has a squeaky bray. Her
long ears stand at full attention and a soft puff of bangs has sprouted from her
forehead. Strands of hay dangle from her nose.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How do you not fall in love with a face like that?'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Alert Declared at Nuclear Plant  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM FITZGERALD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) -- A leak in a steam generator at a Hudson River nuclear
power plant resulted in a brief release of radioactive steam but it was below
dangerous levels, power company officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Con Edison, which owns and operates the Indian Point 2 plant in northern
Westchester County, declared an alert, the second of four increasingly serious
emergency classifications, company spokesman Michael Spall said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no immediate reports of evacuations.
</P>
<P>
	   The size and duration of the leak had not been measured.
</P>
<P>
	   Spall said the plant was shut down, but there had been ``a momentary release
of radioactive material to the environment, below any level that poses a threat
to the safety of plant personnel or the public.''
</P>
<P>
	   Radioactive steam was released for ``a few seconds'' and initially was held
within the plant's containment building, the sealed concrete building that holds
the reactor, Spall said. Later it was determined that some steam also was
released into the air surrounding the plant, Spall said.
</P>
<P>
	   He described the plant as stable but said the alert would last several hours
overnight as the shutoff reactor is cooled.
</P>
<P>
	   Although county officials activated the emergency operations center in White
Plains, they were ``confident the situation is under control,'' county
spokeswoman Adele Dowling said.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident occurred at 7:29 p.m. in a tube used to carry hot, radioactive,
high-pressure water to a pool of cool, non-radioactive water, Spall said. When
the hot water hits the cool water, steam is produced, which turns a turbine and
generates electricity.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal, state and local authorities were notified, Spall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The alert was the first in the plant's 16-year history, Spall said.

<HEADLINE> Potatoes Beat Wheat in Washington  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDA ASHTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- Countries from Japan to Mexico are developing a taste
for American french fries, helping boost potatoes past wheat as the No. 2
agricultural plant crop in Washington state, worth $447 million a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Apples remain the state's top crop, worth more than $684.5 million a year,
and wheat fell to third place, at $402 million, among Washington commodities,
excluding milk and cattle.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're after those apple guys," said Kevin Bouchey, a Toppenish potato
farmer and former president of the Moses Lake-based Washington Potato
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to bragging rights, the ranking, based on 1998 production
figures, also helps increase awareness of the value of the crop to the state's
economy, he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The USDA says the average American eats almost 143 pounds of potatoes a
year, including 16 pounds of potato chips, 48 pounds of baked potatoes and 60
pounds of french fries.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington has the highest per-acre yield for potatoes in the world,
producing 9.3 billion pounds in 1998. Nationally, only Idaho produced more
potatoes -- 13.8 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Increased production and export market gains in Asia and Latin America are
driving growth in the Washington potato industry, Bouchey said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We see a great opportunity in exports," Bouchey said. "Increased exports
are really the key to growth. We see China as a huge opportunity for potatoes,
for our processed products.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of countries raise potatoes, but they don't raise the type and
quality of potato to make a very nice french fry."
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety percent of the potatoes grown in Washington are sold out of state,
mostly to Asia and Latin America, via the ports of Seattle, Tacoma and Portland,
Ore. About one-third of the nation's potato exports are grown in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody likes french fries. They're very popular in Japan," said potato
farmer Jim Reimann, who lives near George, Wash.
</P>
<P>
	   He attributes the Washington potato industry's growth to such factors as
increased international demand, the value-added opportunities that come with
processing, and good growing conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think our production has continued to increase every year," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The so-called Irish white potatoes which are popular crops in the state got
their start thousands of years ago in the Andes Mountains of Peru and Bolivia.
But potato growers may really owe a debt of gratitude to President Thomas
Jefferson, who has been credited with introducing french fries to this country
by serving them at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   About 170,000 acres in Washington are planted in potatoes -- usually some
type of russet.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're a very versatile potato. You can bake them, you can mash them, fry
them, process them," Bouchey said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 87 percent of the crop is processed, primarily for french fries but
also potato chips and dehydrated products.
</P>
<P>
	   That's a change from 40 years ago, when fresh potatoes dominated the market.
While fresh production has been rather flat, specialty varieties such as the
Yukon Golds are gaining in popularity.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Negotiator 'Unemployed'  </HEADLINE>
   By JOCELYN NOVECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Oded Eran seems like a man with some time on his hands.
</P>
<P>
	   If all were going as planned, Israel's chief negotiator to talks with the
Palestinians would be steeped in a schedule of marathon meetings, interrupted by
a constant stream of cellular phone calls.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Tuesday, with the talks frozen and no firm date in sight for their
renewal, Eran was in an unhurried mood. In a 90-minute conversation in his bare
office at the Foreign Ministry, his cell phone rang only once.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm currently unemployed,'' he said with a wan smile. ``I've been meeting
people I didn't have time to see before. Yesterday I sat with people from the
nature reserves, to talk about ecological matters.''
</P>
<P>
	   That seems like small potatoes next to the enormous issues Eran and his
Palestinian counterparts are supposed to resolve in the next seven months: the
borders of a future Palestinian state, the fate of millions of Palestinian
refugees, and the status of Jerusalem, claimed by both sides as their capital.
</P>
<P>
	   But Eran says he now wonders whether the Palestinians truly want a deal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One might get to the conclusion that it's less pressing in their view,
it's easier and politically more convenient, to reach a certain date with no
comprehensive agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, responded angrily to
suggestions the Palestinians weren't fully engaged in peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's absolutely unfair,'' he said. He repeated the view, voiced often by
Palestinians but also privately by some Americans and Israelis, that Israel
itself is not fully engaged on the Palestinian track, because Prime Minister
Ehud Barak puts a higher priority on peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All I can say is that they were not focused on the Palestinian track,'' he
said of the marathon talks that stalled earlier this month. ``I hope they will
gather their courage and strength to focus.''
</P>
<P>
	   The remarks by both men showed the scope of the current impasse, just seven
months before the target date for a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The troubles came into bold relief Sunday ago, with the passing of a key
deadline for a framework agreement. The framework was supposed to serve as an
important bridge to the final deal, envisioned by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now, I must admit that I'm not so sure the Palestinians really wanted to
reach a framework agreement,'' Eran said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Eran, who was tapped for his current task while serving as ambassador to
Jordan, is handling talks not only on the so-called ``final-status'' issues, but
also on Israel's phased pullbacks from West Bank land, under the interim accord.
</P>
<P>
	   It was an ``interim'' issue that broke up the talks on Feb. 3, when Arafat
learned Barak was not going to hand over villages surrounding Jerusalem as part
of the latest transfer. The Palestinians also said Israel was trying to wriggle
out of a further promised West Bank withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Eran wondered aloud whether the Palestinian strategy might be to negotiate
as much land as possible in the remaining transfers, then declare statehood
unilaterally -- as the Palestinians have threatened to do before when talks bog
down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to at least be prepared for the eventuality,'' Eran said, ``that
what they are saying to themselves is that we'll take the rest of the land ...
and then we are free, because the major asset is in our hands, and we will do
whatever we want'' -- meaning, he said, a unilateral declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maybe they are saying, `We are much better off not being seen as making
these painful concessions to the Israelis.' It could very well be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Erekat said Tuesday that a unilateral declaration ``is a very serious option
... and I think Israel should take this very, very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians have put forward three questions to Israel on the main
points in negotiations as a means to get talks started again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until now, they have not answered,'' Erekat said. ``Why can't they just
respond to the questions?'' Eran said Israel hasn't answered because it won't
accept the Palestinians dictating when talks can resume.
</P>
<P>
	   Eran said he still believes a framework can be achieved by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
	   How is that possible, given the huge gaps? ``Because we already know
everything we need to know about the issues,'' Eran said. ``It is simply a
matter of making decisions.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Walk Fine Line  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Debating familiar differences in sharpened tones, Gov.
George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain each tried to prove the other guilty of
negative campaigning, without offering Republican primary voters any new
evidence on which to judge their rival bids for the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Their arguments restated at close quarters the disputes about campaign
tactics, taxes, abortion and conservative credentials they have been aiming at
each other from a distance as they seek votes in the South Carolina primary on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Again, as in debates before, there were no breakthroughs and no blunders,
nothing apt to change the close, testy campaign for the primary that will
reinstate Bush as the clear Republican front-runner, or validate McCain's
campaign to topple him nationally as he did in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   The ninth installment in the Republican debate series, down to three men
now, had some incongruous moments, as when the aggressive Alan Keyes interceded
to chide the leaders for their tone. He said they should stop the ``spitting
match'' and get to the issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain were the principals in the 90-minute debate Monday night in
Columbia, S.C., broadcast nationally by CNN as a ``Larry King Live'' special. At
times, it had a talk show flavor, with King addressing the candidates as Alan
and John, though he always said governor to Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Please call me Senator, or Your Highness,'' McCain joked after King
mentioned the first-name familiarity.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid the bickering, Bush said he considers McCain a conservative, not a
liberal, and ``a fine man.'' McCain said Bush is ``a good man.''
</P>
<P>
	   But they also exchanged accusations of nasty, negative campaigning, and
argued about who started it. ``This campaign spiraled down,'' McCain said. ``I
want the negativism out of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I kind of smiled my way through the early primaries, and got defined,''
Bush said. ``I'm not going to let it happen again.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also got beaten, soundly, in New Hampshire, where McCain won the primary
by 18 points and dented the Texas governor's front-runner status. Bush won in
Iowa and Delaware; McCain bypassed both states.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush repeated his complaint at a McCain ad that accused him of twisting the
truth like President Clinton, a comparison he called ``about as low a blow as
you can give in a Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bush ``really went over the line'' by letting an ally accuse him
of abandoning veterans. ``You're putting out stuff that's unbelievable, George,
and it's got to stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is probably the nastiest campaign that people have seen in a long
time,'' McCain said. ``But look, I'm enjoying it, this is a great and
exhilarating experience.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said McCain was playing the victim. ``Wait a minute,'' he said.
``Remember who called who untrustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
	   So it went, alternating between words of outrage and of agreement on issues.
They squabbled about abortion, on which they basically agree, with Keyes the
absolutist denouncing them both for favoring exceptions to the ban they both
advocate. They argued taxes, as they have before, Bush saying he wants to send
more money back to taxpayers, McCain urging a smaller tax cut, with more funds
to be used for Social Security and debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither candidate wanted to be cast as the attacker, a role that can turn
off voters. But neither wanted to let the other's offense go unrebutted. So they
both tried to balance offense and defense, hard lines and softer ones, to use
needles instead of hammers.
</P>
<P>
	   As in McCain's double-edged retort after Bush called his tax plan a
reflection of the Washington mentality. ``It's the grown-up mentality,'' McCain
said, the mentality that recognizes obligations like the national debt have to
be paid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to give people their money back,'' Bush said. ''... And John, you
know, grown-up or non-grown-up ... that's kind of a line you're trying to come
across with.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed it was, against the rival whose father, the former president, had
come to New Hampshire and urged people to vote for his boy.
</P>
<P>
	   To Keyes, sitting between the leaders and talking more than either of them,
their arguments were ``pointless squabbling.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain certainly squabbled. The question now is whether either of
them scored points in the process.

<HEADLINE> Griffey's Reds Face Pitching Woes  </HEADLINE>
    By JOE KAY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. is just about everything the Cincinnati
Reds need: a hometown talent, a superstar player, a huge draw at the gate.
</P>
<P>
	   If only he could pitch.
</P>
<P>
	   The trade that reunited Griffey with his hometown also subtracted from an
already shaky starting rotation. The Seattle Mariners got right-hander Brett
Tomko as part of the 4-for-1 deal.
</P>
<P>
	   When Griffey shows up along with the other position players next week in
Sarasota, Fla., all the attention is going to be on the center fielder.
</P>
<P>
	   A more important chore starts in Sarasota this week, when the Reds begin
weeding through 37 pitchers to figure out who's in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey will get the headlines, but it will be the pitching that either gets
the Reds to the playoffs or causes them to miss out once again. And right now,
there are at least as many questions about the pitching as there are pitchers in
camp -- 37, after the Reds signed Osvaldo Fernandez to a minor league deal
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's not enough,'' general manager Jim Bowden said. ``You don't get
enough pitching. We've all talked about it. Pitching is going to separate how
far you go.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last season, the Reds made it to the doorstep of the playoffs, losing a
wild-card tiebreaker to the New York Mets. They made it that far because their
bullpen led the majors with a 3.36 ERA. Ron Villone and Steve Parris joined the
rotation during the season and had career years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Reds also got a boost down the stretch from Juan Guzman, acquired in a
July 31 trade. Guzman left as a free agent after the season.
</P>
<P>
	   The bullpen is intact, though not without questions. Can Scott Williamson
repeat the success that made him the NL Rookie of the Year in 1999? Will Danny
Graves and the rest of the youngsters be able to come through again?
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't have a lot of depth in our pitching,'' manager Jack McKeon said.
``It was evident last year when we went out and got Guzman to give us a
last-minute shot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to be concerned. With the experience they got last year, can our
young pitchers continue at the same pace? Or once again, do we have one slip or
fall off for a year?''
</P>
<P>
	   There's little margin for error in the rotation, which was full of questions
even before the Griffey trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Left-hander Denny Neagle hopes to be free of the shoulder weakness that
wiped out much of his 1999 season. Pete Harnisch, the Reds' top starter last
season, chose not to have surgery on his troublesome shoulder. Instead, he did
strengthening exercises hoping to eliminate the pain that limited him much of
the season.
</P>
<P>
	   If those two guys aren't healthy, the Reds are sunk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we're going to win this division, we've got to have Harnisch and Neagle
win 15 games,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
	   The rotation was tottering last season until Villone went from the bullpen
into the rotation for the first time in his career and went a career-best 9-7.
Parris also had a career year, going 11-4 following his May 3 call-up from the
minors.
</P>
<P>
	   The fifth starter? It could be Mark Portugal. The 37-year-old right-hander
went 7-12 with a 5.51 ERA for Boston last season, lost his final four decisions
and was released.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he has medical problems, the only way you find out is to pitch him in
the spring,'' McKeon said. ``If he's healthy, he might be a guy who could be a
sleeper because he does know how to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
	   Regardless of who makes the rotation, McKeon is pushing for a quick start.
The Reds went 9-12 last April, their only month with a losing record, in large
part because of the rotation's struggles.
</P>
<P>
	   The 37 pitchers and seven catchers are scheduled to report in Sarasota
today, take physicals on Thursday and have their first workout on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you talk about our pitching staff, the key is getting ready so we can
have a decent start,'' McKeon said. ``Last year our starters were in trouble
with Neagle, Pete and Steve Avery not being 100 percent. Hopefully, all of our
guys are 100 percent this year.''

<HEADLINE> Sanders To Repay Lions  </HEADLINE>
    By HARRY ATKINS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Lions will have to wait three more years to get
all their money back from Barry Sanders if he stays retired.
</P>
<P>
	   An NFL arbitrator ruled Tuesday that Sanders must pay back one-sixth of his
$11 million signing bonus for each year he fails to play under terms of his
six-year contract.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lions had hoped to get $5.5 million back in one lump sum. Instead,
Sanders must pay back $1.833 million per year. He played two years of a six-year
contract he signed in 1997 before startling the NFL by leaving football on the
eve of training camp last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are pleased the ruling supports the principle that a signing bonus is
contingent upon a player fully performing the services required under the
contract agreement," said Harold Henderson, the NFL's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders is only 1,458 yards shy of breaking Walter Payton's NFL career
record of 16,726 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Ware said he hopes the Lions release Sanders and let him play elsewhere, but
doubts they would. Sanders already has offered to pay back half of his bonus, or
$5.5 million, if the Lions will release him and allow him to play elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Kagel ruled that Sanders owed the Lions only one-sixth of the $11 million
bonus he received in 1997 because he's missed only one season so far.
</P>
<P>
	   Chuck Schmidt, the Lions' chief operating officer, said the club already had
withheld $1.75 million of the signing bonus from the check they sent Sanders for
last season. That means Sanders now owes the team $80,000 to comply with
arbitrator Sam Kagel's ruling for the season just past.
</P>
<P>
	   Unless he returns to football, he will owe $1.83 million on future reporting
dates. Sanders hasn't paid back any money.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides claimed victory -- however hollow -- in the wake of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have contended all along that just because you've retired, you don't owe
the entire amount back," Ware said. "He ruled consistent with our position."
</P>
<P>
	   Ware said he would approach the Lions within a few days with the same offer
he made last August: repaying $5.5 million in exchange for Sanders' release. But
that does not appear likely.
</P>
<P>
	   "As we have always maintained, it is our intention to take Barry at his word
that he has retired from professional football," Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We would welcome him back as a Detroit Lion should he voice to us his
desire to return to active duty in the NFL. Until then, we will hold him to the
conditions put forth by the arbitrator in this case."
</P>
<P>
	   The NFL Players Association said the door remains open for Sanders to
fulfill his contract.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are pleased that the arbitrator limited his award to games missed,"
union lawyer Richard Berthelsen said. "The Lions were obviously overreacting
with their claim ... since Barry could well come back and play his entire
contract."
</P>
<P>
	   But Ware made it clear Sanders would not play with the Lions.
</P>
<P>
	   "Barry is retired," Ware said. "As long as the circumstances remain what
they are, he will remain retired."
</P>
<P>
	   Ware has tried repeatedly to get the Lions to trade their rights to Sanders.
He said other teams appear reluctant to discuss Sanders while he is still
property of the Lions.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if Sanders would play for Detroit again, Ware said: "No. they have a
running back, James Stewart."
</P>
<P>
	   Stewart signed as a free agent Monday.

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Lewis Free on Slayings Bond  </HEADLINE>
    By PATRICIA M. LaHAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Ray Lewis is free for the first time since Jan. 31, when he
was charged with killing two men after a Super Bowl party.
</P>
<P>
	   Surrounded by deputies, Lewis smiled as he left jail on $1 million bond
Tuesday, slipped into a car and rode away with his lawyers, mother and fiancee.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyer said the Baltimore Ravens linebacker would return home today.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, wearing a brown football jersey with the word "Supreme" on the back,
said "I thank God to be out" as he got into the front seat of a car. Defense
attorney Ed Garland said Lewis felt sympathy for the families of the two men who
were killed and looked forward to clearing his name.
</P>
<P>
	   The release on bond was "step one" for Lewis, Garland said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The next step is to get him acquitted," he said. "I never expect him to set
foot in a jail again, unless it's to do charitable work."
</P>
<P>
	   Several family members came to the jail to pick Lewis up. Lewis' mother sat
in the back seat of the car, a copy of "The Inspirational Study Bible" on her
lap. Lewis' fiancee sat with two young boys on her lap beside his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   About 90 minutes before Lewis left the jail, another defendant, Reginald
Oakley, arrived with his lawyer to surrender. A third suspect, Joseph Sweeting,
surrendered Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, 24, and his two companions are charged in the stabbing deaths of two
men during a brawl outside an Atlanta nightclub.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis; Sweeting, 34, of Miami; and Oakley, 31, of Baltimore, were indicted
Friday in the deaths of Richard Lollar, 24, and Jacinth Baker, 21, who were
stabbed during the 4 a.m. fight outside an Atlanta nightclub.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis' lawyers say he tried to stop the fight and that he was at least 60
feet away when Lollar and Baker, both of nearby Decatur, were stabbed. Police
say Lewis drove away in a limousine and later lied when they tried to determine
who was in his entourage.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge Doris Downs ruled Monday that Lewis posed no
significant risk to flee or to intimidate witnesses in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis posted $200,000 of his bond in cash. Nine bond surety companies
provided the remaining $800,000, plus $80,000 in surcharges.
</P>
<P>
	   The bond requires Lewis to stay in Maryland unless he is traveling to
Georgia for court appearances or to meet with his lawyers. It doesn't permit him
to visit Florida, where his fiancee and two of his children live.
</P>
<P>
	   Downs also said Lewis may not use alcohol or drugs while he is out on bond
and that he must be home every night by 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland's corrections department will monitor Lewis' compliance with his
curfew and the other requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   LaMont W. Flanagan, commissioner of pretrial detention and services for
Maryland, said his department has agreed to conduct weekly tests for drugs and
alcohol and to have a caseworker meet with Lewis weekly at the pretrial services
office in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will ensure that the stipulations of the supervision plan are strictly
adhered to," Flanagan said.

<HEADLINE> NBC To Deal With Hancock on Ads  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The verbal war between NBC sports president Dick
Ebersol and outspoken corporate critic David D'Alessandro is over.
</P>
<P>
	The two men, who exchanged pointed barbs last year over the Salt Lake City
Olympic scandal, are ready to do business again.
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro, president and chief executive officer of John Hancock Financial
Services, pulled out of negotiations with NBC for Olympic ads a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	But the two men spoke Tuesday and agreed to begin talks on a new contract worth
around $20 million.
</P>
<P>
	``His TV sales people and our TV advertising people will sit down in the next
two weeks and work out the arrangements so that he'll be an NBC sponsor for
Sydney, and hopefully in our coverage of the Olympics beyond,'' Ebersol told The
Associated Press from New York.
</P>
<P>
	The deal could be completed within a month, Ebersol said.
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol spoke shortly after D'Alessandro, the most vocal corporate critic of
the Olympic movement, signed a deal with the International Olympic Committee to
continue as a worldwide sponsor of the games.
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock renewed for a four-year period covering the 2002 Winter Games in
Salt Lake and the 2004 Summer Games in Athens, Greece. The deal was valued at
more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
	Early last year, D'Alessandro canceled talks with NBC for ads during Olympic
telecasts to protest the IOC's handling of the bribery scandal centered on Salt
Lake City's winning bid.
</P>
<P>
	NBC has a $3.5 billion deal with the IOC for the U.S. television rights to five
Olympics between 2000 and 2008.
</P>
<P>
	Last April, Ebersol publicly accused D'Alessandro of making ``cynical'' and
``self-serving'' attacks on the IOC, described him as a ``bully'' motivated by a
thirst for publicity and said NBC was not interested in having him as an
advertiser.
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro retorted by calling Ebersol's statements a ``desperate and sad
commentary.''
</P>
<P>
	But the two have now patched up their differences.
</P>
<P>
	``I was just preaching very sternly for patience at the beginning of the
summer,'' Ebersol said Wednesday. ``I just wanted David to stop and listen at
that point in time. I got fairly vociferous in my telling him to stop, but he
did and I commend him for that. He did not turn deaf ears on the movement. He
made an effort to listen.''
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said he and D'Alessandro found common ground when they met for the
first time in late September during the Ryder Cup in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	The two discussed the work of the IOC 2000 reform commission, of which Ebersol
was an outside member. The panel drew up a package of 50 reforms adopted by the
full IOC in December.
</P>
<P>
	``He (D'Alessandro) did pay very close attention to what the IOC was doing,''
Ebersol said. ``He came to the conclusions that the reforms were totally in the
right direction and that they (IOC leaders) were living up to the promises that
they'd made.''
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said NBC still has Olympic advertising space available in the financial
services category. He said D'Alessandro has an advantage over other companies
because, as an official IOC sponsor, he has the rights to use the Olympic rings
in his TV ads.
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said NBC has already sold more than $750 million in ads for telecasts
during the Sydney Games, compared to $670 million for the 1996 Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ebersol hailed the preparations for the Sydney Games as the best he
had ever seen. The games open in seven months on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
	``There has never been a games in this kind of shape at this stage,'' Ebersol
said. ``I never had a comfort zone in Atlanta (1996), even the morning before
the opening ceremonies. In Barcelona (1992), the first time I had any real sense
the games were going to be OK was in June, a month before the opening. I thought
a year ago in February that Sydney almost could have put the games on then.''
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol downplayed the highly publicized controversies over ticketing and
budget shortfalls in Sydney as part of the ``adversarial'' political landscape
in Australia.
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is the proof's in the pudding,'' he said. ``The venues, the
television arrangements, the transportation, the setup for the visitors, the
hotels -- it will be rare in our lifetimes ever to see anything like this
again.''

<HEADLINE> Women's Soccer League Gets $40M  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Women's soccer has come so far in the United States that
competing groups want the right to run a league.
</P>
<P>
	   Saying it has raised $40 million from cable television companies and has the
support of the U.S. World Cup champions, a group said Tuesday it plans to start
a women's soccer league of 8-10 teams in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Not so fast, Major League Soccer said. It wants in on women's soccer and
might submit a rival plan to the U.S. Soccer Federation.
</P>
<P>
	   "This a breakthrough kind of deal," said John Hendricks, founder of the
Discovery Channel and the force behind the league, to be called Women's United
Soccer Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "People feel," Hendricks said, "there is something very attractive and
enduring that these women have touched deep within the fabric of American
society -- it's not just soccer moms, it's soccer dads and soccer uncles."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the eight investors putting up $5 million each are Time Warner Inc.,
Comcast Corp., Continental Cablevision Inc. and Cox Communications. Each
investor will have the right to operate one or more franchises. They also would
get the local television rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Salaries will average $40,000 for a five-month season starting in April. The
cities will be selected from among a pool of 15 the group is considering, and
the projected average attendance is 6,500.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will be the world's premier league for women's soccer," Mia Hamm, a
star with the women's World Cup champions, said. "One of the things we realized
and have known for a while is how deep the player pool is. The level of
competition is going to be extremely high."
</P>
<P>
	   The USSF probably will designate a Division I women's league within two
months, spokesman Jim Moorhouse said Wednesday. MLS, the men's league that began
in 1996, has been working on a plan for a women's league.
</P>
<P>
	   "The application from the John Hendricks group is further proof that soccer
is booming in the United States," MLS commissioner Don Garber said. "Major
League Soccer supports women's soccer and looks forward to being part of this
exciting development."
</P>
<P>
	   Hendricks said the most difficult task was finding suitable stadiums, a
problem MLS also has had in some markets. MLS, whose growth has been slower than
it originally hoped, averaged 17,406 for regular-season games in 1996, then
14,619, 14,312 and 14,282 from 1997-99.
</P>
<P>
	   "We would like not to see these events held in monstrous NFL stadiums,"
Hendricks said. "We would like to see the development of 15,000-20,000-seat
stadiums for these games. In a lot of the markets, we see the opportunity to
combine with the efforts of men's professional leagues and colleges and
universities who want to upgrade their facilities."
</P>
<P>
	   Tony DiCicco, who resigned as U.S. national team coach last fall, is a WUSA
adviser. The women's players, many of whom led the United States to World Cup
titles in 1991 and 1999, and the Olympic gold medal in 1996, will be part owners
of the league.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a possibility of getting some payback at the end of the day for the
success of the league," Julie Foudy, co-captain of the American World Cup team,
said. "We think one of the greatest assets this team has is we love to get out
in the community and promote and sell. That's what we've been doing our entire
careers."

Alert Declared at Nuclear Plant
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) -- A leak in a steam generator at a Hudson River nuclear
power plant resulted in a brief release of radioactive steam but it was below
dangerous levels, power company officials said. Con Edison, which owns and
operates the Indian Point 2 plant in northern Westchester County, declared an
alert, the second of four increasingly serious emergency classifications,
company spokesman Michael Spall said. There were no immediate reports of
evacuations. Spall said the plant was shut down, but there had been "a momentary
release of radioactive material to the environment, below any level that poses a
threat to the safety of plant personnel or the public."

his crimes during the 1941-44 Nazi occupation. "Latvia is ready to take over
this investigation," Dzintra Subrovska, spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office,

<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) -- A leak in a steam generator at a Hudson River nuclear
power plant resulted in a brief release of radioactive steam but it was below
dangerous levels, power company officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Con Edison, which owns and operates the Indian Point 2 plant in northern

emergency classifications, company spokesman Michael Spall said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no evacuations, Spall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The size and duration of the leak had not been measured.
</P>
<P>
	   Spall said the plant was shut down, but there had been ``a momentary release
of radioactive material to the environment, below any level that poses a threat
to the safety of plant personnel or the public.''
</P>
<P>
	   Radioactive steam was released for ``a few seconds'' and initially was held
within the plant's containment building, the sealed concrete building that holds
the reactor, Spall said. Later it was determined that some steam also was
released into the air surrounding the plant, Spall said.
</P>
<P>
	   He described the plant as stable but said the alert would last several hours
overnight as the shutoff reactor is cooled.
</P>
<P>
	   Although county officials activated the emergency operations center in White
Plains, they were ``confident the situation is under control,'' county
spokeswoman Adele Dowling said.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident occurred at 7:29 p.m. in a tube used to carry hot, radioactive,
high-pressure water to a pool of cool, non-radioactive water, Spall said. When
the hot water hits the cool water, steam is produced, which turns a turbine and
generates electricity.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal, state and local authorities were notified, Spall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The alert was the first in the plant's 16-year history, Spall said.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Trade Charges  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Republican presidential rivals Gov. George W. Bush
and Sen. John McCain fought over campaign financing and the tenor of their
nomination contest in a testy debate, with Bush warning that some of McCain's
charges are ``as low a blow as you can give'' in GOP politics.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain offered a stern lecture of his own and demanded that Bush apologize
for an event at which McCain's commitment to veterans was questioned by a Bush
backer. ``You should be ashamed,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Days before the South Carolina primary adds definition to the fight for the
GOP presidential nomination, Bush and McCain brought their differences of
opinion before a national audience for a 90-minute debate in which they were
joined by rival Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has sought to make the tenor of the campaign an issue by pulling all
of his negative ads and promising a positive campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Texas governor, seated a few feet away, waved a printed flier that
attacked Bush over Social Security, a copy of which he said turned up Monday on
a car windshield.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is not by my campaign,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It says paid for by John McCain,'' came the instant rejoinder from Bush.
In post-debate comments, McCain conceded that Bush may well have been right.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show Bush and McCain locked in a competitive race and the debate,
broadcast by CNN, was the biggest opportunity the rivals had to make their case
before Saturday's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   They took advantage with relish, lashing at each other repeatedly and
drawing scorn from the lesser-known Keyes, who repeatedly tried to inject
himself into the debate by accusing the others of dodging issues. At one point,
he suggested the debate was like a mud fight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I really am sitting here wondering, is this the kind of pointless
squabbling we really want them to see,'' he said of the worldwide audience.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the debate's harsher moments came when McCain, a former prisoner of
war, lectured Bush about a supporter who questioned McCain's commitment to
veterans' issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if you can understand this George, but that really hurts,''
said McCain, a former Navy pilot. ``That really hurts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he shouldn't be held responsible for what his backers say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe you have served your country nobly,'' Bush replied, adding there
was a reason for his attacks. ``I kind of smiled my way through the early
primaries and kind of got defined and I am not going to let that happen again.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush pointed to earlier charges by McCain that compared Bush to President
Clinton, and had a lecture of his own.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't equate my integrity and trustworthiness to Bill Clinton,'' said
Bush. ``That's about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show a very close race between the two rivals in South Carolina,
leaving little doubt about the reasons behind the heated exchanges.
</P>
<P>
	   There were plenty of other differences, too, including over abortion and
campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush touted a plan unveiled earlier Tuesday to overhaul campaign financing,
arguing he's long been focused on McCain's centerpiece issue. McCain derided it
as riddled with loopholes.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also was picking up an endorsement today from Bill Jones, the
California secretary of state who had endorsed Bush last year but has decided to
switch to McCain. Jones was expected to stress the Arizona senator's commitment
to campaign finance changes.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also accused Bush of supporting a Republican Party platform that
calls for an outright ban on abortion. Bush said he supports the platform, but
would permit abortions in cases of rape, incest or when the woman's life would
be endangered.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes sought to tag McCain for suggesting he would support a hypothetical
decision by his daughter to have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How on earth would you represent a party that would take away from every
other American woman what you would give your daughter?'' Keyes asked, drawing a
stern retort from McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've seen enough killing in my life, a lot more than you, and I know how
precious human life is,'' McCain said. ``Do not bring my daughter into it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush refused to answer a similar question about one of his daughters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain also traded barbs over tax cuts, an area where McCain argues
that Bush would fritter away the budget surplus with an overly generous
proposal. Bush rejects that, arguing that he simply wants to give money back to
the people instead of leaving it with Washington bureaucrats.

<HEADLINE> IRA Pulls Out of Disarmament Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Irish Republican Army's retreat from
disarmament talks has cast a shadow over efforts to restore power to a
Catholic-Protestant administration for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   Hopes were running low that talks in London today could rebuild relations,
particularly after the IRA announced Tuesday it had stopped cooperating with the
province's disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair invited the Irish government and three key
Northern Ireland parties in the suspended power-sharing Cabinet to his London
residence.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern planned to talk with separate
delegations from the major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists; the major
Catholic party, the Social Democratic and Labor Party; and Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the IRA appeared to reject, once again, a central premise of the
Good Friday peace accord of 1998: that the province's outlawed paramilitary
groups were supposed to disarm as proof that their cease-fires were genuine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who have made the political process conditional on the
decommissioning of silenced IRA guns are responsible for the current crisis in
the peace process,'' the IRA said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein, which had two posts in the 12-member Cabinet until Britain
stripped it of power Friday, blamed the British government and the Ulster
Unionists for forcing the IRA's hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said other parties were wrong to think he could
get IRA commanders to change their mind. The only way forward, he said, was to
transfer power immediately back to the Cabinet in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
	   But that appeared extremely unlikely, given that the Ulster Unionists --
essential to the Cabinet's survival, but badly split over the merits of sharing
power with Sinn Fein -- have insisted that the IRA must first promise to disarm
and specify how it will happen and when it will start. The British and Irish
governments have backed this requirement.
</P>
<P>
	   But the IRA said the British and Ulster Unionists ``have no desire to deal
with the issue of arms except on their own terms. Those who seek a military
victory in this way need to understand that this cannot and will not happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   The past week's setbacks unraveled a breakthrough deal struck in November by
American mediator George Mitchell. At that time, the Ulster Unionists agreed to
accept Sinn Fein as Cabinet colleagues, but in return expected the IRA to
cooperate with the disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein did announce for the first time that disarmament was
``essential.'' After the Cabinet's formation, the IRA launched direct talks with
the commission.
</P>
<P>
	   But its first detailed report Jan. 31 found that the IRA had offered no
commitments, triggering the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   A second report, which seemed to hint that the IRA might someday disarm by
noting that it was considering scenarios for putting its arsenal ``beyond use,''
appeared hours after Britain resumed direct control of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   But the IRA noted Tuesday that the latest offer -- deemed too vague by the
British government and Ulster Unionists, but welcomed by the Irish government --
had been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA, rooted in the most militant Catholic areas of Northern Ireland, has
been observing a cease-fire since 1997. Previously it waged a 27-year campaign
of bombings and shootings designed to abolish the Protestant-majority province,
which was founded in 1920 shortly before the rest of Ireland won independence
from Britain.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Group Tries Blocking Book  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abdul Wahab Alkebsi was taken aback when his 12-year-old
daughter brought home a novel entitled ``The Terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
	   When he read the book written for middle schoolers that describes an
American student's attempt to avenge her young brother's murder at the hands of
a Muslim girl,he became angry. Now an Islamic advocacy group has demanded
Scholastic Inc. , stop distributing the book, maintaining that it contains
inaccurate, offensive and stereotypical references to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   In the book, Laura, an American student at a private school in London seeks
to avenge her 11-year-old brother's murder by 15-year-old Jehran, a Muslim girl
who is trying to escape from a forced marriage to a 54-year-old man with three
other wives. She had sought the American boy's U.S. passport as a means of
escape.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You get really skeptical when you see a title like that,'' said Alkebsi,
who oversees international affairs for the Islamic Institute, a Washington think
tank.
</P>
<P>
	   Alkebsi of Potomac, Md., said the book was extremely stressful for his
seventh-grade daughter, Zainab.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It hurt my feelings and I was upset and scared what people will think
after reading about these stereotypes,'' the seventh-grader, who read the book
based on a reading list provided by her teacher at the Earle B. Wood Middle
School, in suburban Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   The Montgomery County, Md., Public Schools did not return calls seeking
comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Her father sent a copy of the book to the Council on American-Islamic
Relations, which argues that the novel gives children an unfair picture of
Muslim culture, particularly marriage customs. And the group said it contains
inaccurate, offensive and stereotypical references to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   The group asked the book's publisher, Scholastic Inc., -- a company known
for many successful books for young people such as the highly acclaimed ``The
Magic School Bus'' -- from distributing the 198-page novel, which was first
released in 1997. It is aimed at children 12 and older.
</P>
<P>
	   Judy Corman, senior vice president of the New York-based publishing company,
defended the novel as an award-winning ``work of fiction'' and said the
publisher would not stop distribution to schools around the country.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the book by Caroline B. Cooney, who has written more than 60 novels
for Scholastic, does not stereotype Muslims and that they knew of only one
complaint -- the one from the Washington group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do not believe in censorship,'' Corman said. ``We believe a parent has
the right to say what their children read. We do not believe that one parent has
the right to tell other people what to read.''
</P>
<P>
	   Corman said objections have been raised about a variety of children's books
from them and other publishers, ranging from the popular ``Harry Potter'' series
about a boy who is learning to become a wizard to the science fiction book ``The
Adventures of Captain Underpants.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Council on American-Islamic Relations on Tuesday issued a statement
urging Muslim parents to monitor their children's reading lists and suggest
alternative titles.
</P>
<P>
	   Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the American-Islamic council said the group
was concerned because the book is intended as a teaching aid. ``What we have
here is a situation where impressionable students are assigned this book,'' he
said, adding that the group is not asking book stores to remove the novel from
shelves.
</P>
<P>
	   Corman could not immediately say how many of the books have been distributed
or how many schools have placed it on reading lists.
</P>
<P>
	   Schools have a special responsibility to address group stereotypes, said
Helen Samhan, executive vice president of the Arab American Institute, an
educational foundation based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The way Muslims are portrayed in schools can in a sense undo some of these
stereotypes that are so prevalent in our popular culture,'' said Samhan, who has
helped write educational texts about Muslim and Christian Arabs.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief: Real Free Trade Is Best  </HEADLINE>
    By NAOMI KOPPEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Appealing to rich nations to open up their
markets, the chief of the World Trade Organization said today that aid handouts
cannot help the poorest countries as much as selling goods in real free trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Moore told the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development that trade
could be a force for peace in the world, but for it to work, everyone has to
have access and the gaps between rich and poor countries must narrow.
</P>
<P>
	   The gaps are growing in the rapidly globalizing, high-tech economy, Moore
said, urging rich nations to help the least developed countries catch up by
lowering trade barriers to their exports.
</P>
<P>
	   "The status quo is not enough," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
	   He presided over the WTO's attempt to launch a new round of trade
negotiations last year in Seattle to define commerce in the globalized age.
</P>
<P>
	   But the summit collapsed amid violent street protests and disputes between
rich and poor nations and between the biggest trade powers: the United States,
European Union and Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   American trade unions were strongly opposed to lowering trade barriers to
textiles from developing countries, one of the few products where the poor have
a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
	   The UNCTAD meeting, held every four years, had been billed by organizers as
the first big conference since Seattle with a chance to get the paralyzed
process moving. But apart from Japan, no wealthy nations sent high-level
delegations.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and European Union say trade disputes should be handled by
the WTO, which enforces treaties, and not UNCTAD, which promotes trade in
developing countries to lift them out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   But the meeting has served as a sounding board for leaders, ministers, heads
of international agencies and non-governmental organizations -- whose input is
being actively sought to avoid a repeat of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore said one of his biggest disappointments in Seattle was his failure to
persuade wealthy nations to open up their markets to the world's 48 least
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no point in spending billions in aid if production can't then get
to the market," Moore said. "The voyage of opportunity is not just for the
first-class passengers, but for all of us. We cooperate or we perish."
</P>
<P>
	   Security was tightened around the conference center for Moore's appearance.
Police thoroughly searched the bags of reporters and delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials were keen to avoid a repeat of Monday's embarrassment, where an
American anti-free trade activist threw a pie in the face of outgoing
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus. He was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm unaware of any threat against Mike Moore this morning, really," said
Janick Mangain, UNCTAD's security chief. "We've increased security a bit to
avoid any incident with a chocolate cake."
</P>
<P>
	   Moore, 51, a former New Zealand prime minister, and Camdessus are hate
figures for some critics of the world trade system who see the organizations
they head as cementing the power of rich countries, particularly the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Anderson Files Lawsuit Against Iran  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sulome Anderson first knew her father as a worn
photograph, ``hugging it all the time, kissing it, talking to it.''
</P>
<P>
	   When she met him in person at age 6, ``I froze. It was scary to see the man
instead of the picture,'' the 14-year-old daughter of former hostage Terry
Anderson told a federal judge in her family's $100 million lawsuit against Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   A hearing in the lawsuit was resuming today after U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson ruled Iran in default on Tuesday because the Iranian government
failed to send a representative to the court. The only remaining issue is to
determine the size of the judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson, 52, the former chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press who now teaches journalism at Ohio University, was the longest held U.S.
hostage in Lebanon. He was released in 1991 after being held captive for 2,454
days. He accused Iran of financing and directing the Islamic fundamentalist
Beirut terrorists who kept him captive.
</P>
<P>
	   After a day of emotional testimony by Anderson, his Lebanese-born wife,
Madeleine Bassil, and their daughter, Sulome, the judge declared that in his 18
years on the federal bench, ``I have never heard testimony as compelling as I
have today.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a similar case, Jackson in August 1998 ordered Iran to pay $65 million in
damages to fellow American hostages David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio and Frank
Reed, and the wives of Cicippio and Reed.
</P>
<P>
	   Both that suit and the one by the Anderson family were filed under a 1996
law that lets Americans subjected to terrorism in foreign countries sue in U.S.
courts if the State Department lists those nations as sponsors of terrorism.
Iran has been on the list since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, no money has been collected under the 1996 law because it lacks an
enforcement mechanism. But a bipartisan effort appears to be growing in Congress
for legislation to allow winning plaintiffs to tap into frozen assets of such
countries. The Clinton administration has also signaled a willingness to try to
work out a way to get some compensation to the families.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My kidnappers were Lebanese. ... But they were trained by, funded by and
sometimes led by Iran'' said Anderson.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Oakley, a former diplomat who monitored Middle East terrorist
activities at the State Department during the time the Americans were held in
Beirut, was to testify today. CBS anchor Dan Rather was also to testify.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Anderson recounted the agonizing and humiliating experience of
being in chains for nearly seven years.
</P>
<P>
	   But for Anderson and his family, his release started a different ordeal, one
of trying to make their new life together work. For years, Anderson said he
drifted, having problems making decisions, getting along with his family,
feeling comfortable in crowds and expressing his emotions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was damaged a great deal more than I was aware of -- than anyone was
aware of,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
	   For Madeleine Bassil, who was seven month pregnant when Anderson was
kidnapped, life was equally difficult, she said. ``It was very hard, the
waiting. It was agonizing.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of his kidnapping, they lived together in an apartment in Beirut
and Anderson was in the process of getting a divorce from his first wife. She
and Anderson were married after his release.
</P>
<P>
	   Bassil said she felt uprooted, moving from Lebanon to the United States to
have her daughter, then to London, then to Cyprus, where she and Sulome awaited
Anderson's release. ``I don't forgive easily. I don't forget easily. They (Iran)
haven't admitted they're wrong. And they should pay,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sulome, who is now in ninth grade, said during the early years, ``I depended
a lot on my mother. And she was unhappy a lot of the time.''
</P>
<P>
	   But her own adjustment to having two parents instead of just her mother also
was difficult. When Anderson told her to do things, like clean her room, ``I
hated him,'' she said. Now things are much smoother, the teen-ager said. ``It
took as long as he had been away -- half my life -- to get our family back
together.''

<HEADLINE> Religious Rights, Stock Market Eyed  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over protests of the Treasury Department, a new
government commission on religious freedom abroad is trying to stop regimes that
suppress religions from financing projects with money from U.S. stock markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury insists that trade sanctions, such as those in place against Sudan,
do not apply to capital markets.
</P>
<P>
	   But the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom plans to watch
new stock offerings from foreign governments and use its power of persuasion
with the markets -- the only power it has.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine-member commission focused in its first public hearing Tuesday on
abuses against minority Christians in Sudan, which the United States considers
an exporter of terrorism, and on a Chinese government-owned oil company's
projects in that East African country.
</P>
<P>
	   At Tuesday's hearing, an exiled Sudanese Catholic bishop alleged that a
Sudanese military plane intentionally bombed a school in his district last
Tuesday and killed 14 children. Bishop Macram Max Gassis accused the government
of trying to kill off the country's Roman Catholic minority. ``If you destroy
the fruit, you will have no more trees tomorrow,'' Gassis said.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton described the bombing an outrage and said in a statement
that such events have become commonplace in Sudan's 17-year civil war, which has
claimed 2 million lives.
</P>
<P>
	   The official Sudan News Agency quoted the foreign minister, Mustafa Osman
Ismail, as saying if government bombs did kill children, it was an accident of
war, because rebel fighters had amassed near the elementary school.
</P>
<P>
	   The religious freedom commission, which is to take up abuses of religion in
Russia and China later in the year, has appealed to Clinton to prohibit the
Chinese state oil company and others from using U.S. capital markets to finance
projects in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department insists that existing sanctions against Sudan cannot
apply to capital markets. Sudan is under U.S. sanctions both for allegedly
exporting terrorism and abuse of its Christian minority.
</P>
<P>
	   In view of Treasury's position, Commission members have said they plan to
meet with experts and market managers to explore ``voluntary adoption of human
rights and religious-freedom criteria'' for entry into U.S. stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the commission has appointed a task force to monitor plans by
China National Oil Co. to raise money through a listing on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   PetroChina, owned by the company, is expected to proceed with an initial
public offering in excess of $5 billion in the next several weeks, said Roger
Robinson Jr., a former National Security Council director, now chairman of the
William J. Casey Institute of the Center for Security Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese investment in the 940-mile pipeline from Heglid in southern Sudan to
Port Sudan on the Red Sea, completed in September, is part of the state oil
company's largest overseas venture. The Chinese oil company also helped build a
refinery in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson said the commission needs to evaluate whether the Chinese IPO can
ensure that money raised in U.S. markets are not diverted to the oil company's
project in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   The religious freedom commission was set up to advise the State Department
and the White House on protection of religious freedom around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Organized under a 1998 law that arose partly out of rising congressional
unease about alleged persecution of Christians abroad, it is headed by Rabbi
David Saperstein and George Washington University Law School Dean Michael K.
Young and includes people of Christian, Muslim and Baha'i faiths.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the law that created the panel, the State Department has designated
China, Iran, Iraq, Burma and Sudan as ``countries of particular concern'' for
religious freedom. That designation subjects them to diplomatic and economic
sanctions. The department also lists Serbia and the Taliban movement that rules
most of Afghanistan as ``particularly severe violators of religious freedom.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Computer Research Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government would funnel $6.9 billion over the next
five years into computer and scientific research projects under a measure passed
by the House that lawmakers hope will maintain the nation's role as an economic
and technology leader.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would fund a host of research projects, including ways to speed up
the Internet and how to integrate computing and medical research.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today's House passage marks a great investment in the future and a strong
commitment to strengthening the scientific enterprise,'' Science Committee
Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., said after Tuesday's voice vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would almost double the amount spent on technology research last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is impossible to imagine that the U.S. economy would have enjoyed the
record-setting growth of the last nine years without past federal investments in
communications and computer technology,'' said Rep. Ralph Hall, R-Texas and the
ranking Democrat on the Science Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Sensenbrenner said the money ``helps replenish the pipeline of fundamental
research breakthroughs and scientific discoveries in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers have noted that the Internet was based largely on technology
developed in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would authorize the money to be spent over the next five years by
several agencies, chief among them, the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to providing money to increase technology research, the bill
includes $95 million for mathematics and science research internships for
college students.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure now goes to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The research is designed to supplement advances already being made by the
private sector. The government's initiative would focus on basic fundamental
research, costly projects that may take years of study. Often, private industry
focuses more on short-term developments that can deliver a quick profit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think 20 years from now, as historians look back, they will view this as
probably the most single important piece of legislation that the Congress
considers,'' said Sensenbrenner. ``America will have made a commitment to the
information technology research we need to continue ... as number one in this
area.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE -- The bill is H.R. 2086.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Tops GOP Trade Agenda  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders say that putting trade relations
with China on a permanent basis is at the top of their efforts this year to
promote free trade policies.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP leaders, at a news conference Tuesday, said they will also move
early this year on measures to open trade with sub-Saharan Africa and the
Caribbean and to reassert the U.S. leadership role in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration, also gearing up for an expected summer vote on China,
estimated that a U.S.-China agreement last November on opening Chinese markets
could triple U.S. farm exports to $3 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
	   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told farm lobbyists they have to be
``intent and focused'' and he urged them to organize pressure on members of
Congress from farmers and other constituents to win the China vote.
</P>
<P>
	   China's trade status is currently decided in a highly charged annual debate
between the administration and others who believe that normal trade with China
promotes democracy and prosperity in that country and those who argue that China
must first earn good trade relations by improving its human rights and weapons
proliferation records.
</P>
<P>
	   To benefit from the more open markets China has promised under the November
agreement, a precursor to China's accession to the WTO, Congress must agree to
make permanent normal trade relations with the Beijing government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we care about freedom as well as prosperity, democracy as well as
economic opportunity, we must expand our trade with the Chinese people,'' said
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Armey said that before April Congress will try to complete legislation to
promote freer trade with sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. The House last
year passed a bill that would allow most products from sub-Saharan Africa to
enter the country with no quotas or duties. The Senate passed a more limited
Africa trade bill and tacked on another measure to promote trade with the
Caribbean. The two chambers have yet to reach a compromise bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Second, he said, the House will work to ``soundly defeat'' expected
legislation that would withdraw U.S. support from the WTO. ``The WTO is not the
villain the Seattle radicals and their Washington allies would have us
believe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Support for China and other trade votes is weaker among the Democrats, who
have ties with labor, human rights and environmental groups that question free
trade policies. But several Republicans said they believed President Clinton was
serious about winning the needed Democratic votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., said he and other lawmakers met Clinton Tuesday
night and ``the president said he would have a very strong campaign to make sure
we win here.''
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has assigned Commerce Secretary William Daley to lead its
lobbying efforts on the China issue. White House Chief of Staff John Podesta
told farm groups last week that ``this is going to be the toughest fight we face
this year on Capitol Hill.''

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Claims Being Accepted  </HEADLINE>
   By PAULINE JELINEK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A worldwide search for Holocaust survivors who may have
unpaid insurance policies got under way with the opening of telephone
information centers in 41 nations, one of many steps planned to alert those
eligible for the program.
</P>
<P>
	   The International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims announced
that people who believe they or their families have unsettled policies bought
between 1920 and 1945 may file claims for payment.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of the panel have said some survivors or heirs who tried to
collect on policies after World War II went unpaid because insurers asked for
documentation such as policies or death certificates -- something impossible to
produce for most concentration camp victims or their survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Commission Chairman Lawrence Eagleburger said Tuesday that companies now
have agreed to ``relaxed standards'' for evaluating old claims. A commission
statement suggested victims might support their claims with diary entries
reflecting policy payments, premium receipts, private correspondence mentioning
coverage and recollections regarding insurance agents' visits.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission was planning a newspaper ad campaign, flyers and press
conferences elsewhere in the world as part of a $9 million effort to find people
and begin processing claims, Eagleburger said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to be able to say that we have done everything possible to reach
all potential claimants and pay Holocaust-related insurance claims in a fair and
expeditious manner,'' said Eagleburger, a former U.S. secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
	   Eagleburger's commission negotiated among itself to come up with the plan.
It included Jewish and Holocaust survivor groups, U.S. and European regulators,
the country of Israel and five European insurance companies that operated during
the era and now have subsidiaries in the United States: Assicurazioni Generali
of Italy, Allianz AG of Germany, AXA of France, and Winterthur Leben and Zurich
Financial Services from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We ... are committed to a fair and just resolution of the claims
process,'' the five insurers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Other European companies also have unpaid claims, and the commission will
try to get them to pay as well, Eagleburger said.
</P>
<P>
	   Eagleburger said he didn't know how many people have such claims or how much
they're owed overall. But he said some have estimated it could cost up to
several billion dollars to pay them back under the negotiated agreement that
they get 10 times the original value of their policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Individuals who believe they may have unpaid insurance claims can contact
visit the commission's Web site at www.ICHEIC.org, or calling a toll-free
number, 1-800-957-3203 in the United States. The Web site also lists toll-free
numbers in the other countries, or ones that can be called collect.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Celebrates Kim's Birthday  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea celebrated leader Kim Jong Il's
birthday today, and U.S. and South Korean troops prepared to stage a large-scale
joint military exercise.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korean officials believe that Kim, who turned 58 today, is in firm
control of the communist country and its 1.1 million-member military, the
world's fifth-largest.
</P>
<P>
	   That seemed evident during the celebrations, which included a military
statement of support, mass rallies, sports contests, art exhibitions, and poetry
composed in the leader's honor, the North's foreign news outlet, KCNA, said. The
highlight was to be marches by thousands of soldiers, students and workers to
Kim's birthplace at Mount Paektu on the border with China.
</P>
<P>
	   Top military officials, including Gen. Kim Il Cho, minister of the North's
People's Armed Forces, gathered at the leader's birthplace and vowed loyalty to
him, the KCNA said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All the officers and men of the (military) should absolutely worship and
follow only the respected supreme commander, be human bombs and suicide bombers
to defend'' him, the KCNA quoted the officials as saying in a resolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Thoms Schwartz, commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, said North
Korea has a ``tremendous'' chemical weapons arsenal and has upgraded its
military capabilities in the last few years despite its weak economy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have continued to improve their'' military posture, Schwartz said at
a luncheon meeting with reporters. ``The threat has not lessened.''
</P>
<P>
	   In communism's first dynastic succession, Kim Jong Il inherited power from
his late father, President Kim Il Sung, who died in 1994 at age 82.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no sign that Kim Jong Il's grip on power is slipping,'' South
Korea's Unification Ministry said in a policy paper this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim Jong Il is generally viewed in the West as a danger, possibly armed with
nuclear bombs. He also is believed to have missiles capable of reaching Hawaii
and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   In a rare positive assessment, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung last week
described Kim Jong Il as ``a leader with considerable judgment and knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
	   The assessment, in an interview with Japanese TV, was viewed as an effort by
Kim Dae-jung to set up a summit meeting with the North Korean leader. Since the
division of their peninsula in 1945, the heads of the rival Koreas have never
met.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the comment touched off anti-government protests in South
Korea, and the conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper called it ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lately, North Korea appears to have begun reaching out to the West. It is
engaged in a dialogue with the United States and has opened relations with
Italy. In a move that appeared to be timed with the birthday, North Korea opened
a consulate in Hong Kong today, Seoul officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, U.S. and South Korean troops, braving wintry weather, prepared
today to hold their first joint night air assault drills in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking part in the one-day exercise were 350 South Korean troops, assisted
by 36 U.S. and South Korean assault helicopters. The number of U.S. troops
involved was not known.
</P>
<P>
	   Yoon Il-young, a spokesman for Seoul's Defense Ministry, denied the drills
were timed to coincide with Kim Jong Il's birthday. He said it was just one of
the many joint military exercises held by the allies annually.
</P>
<P>
	   The North often criticizes such exercises as signs of aggression.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States fought on South Korea's side in the 1950-53 Korean War.
Today, 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a defense treaty.

<HEADLINE> Alert Declared at Nuclear Plant  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM FITZGERALD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) -- A leak in a steam generator at a Hudson River nuclear
power plant resulted in a brief release of radioactive steam but it was below
dangerous levels, power company officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Consolidated Edison, which owns and operates the Indian Point 2 plant in
northern Westchester County, declared an alert, the second of four increasingly
serious emergency classifications, company spokesman Michael Spall said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no evacuations, Spall said. Buchanan is about 35 miles north of
New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission were monitoring the scene.
The air around the plant was measured for radiation, and results showed nothing
above normal levels, Con Edison said.
</P>
<P>
	   The size and duration of the leak had not been measured.
</P>
<P>
	   Spall said the plant was shut down, but there had been ``a momentary release
of radioactive material to the environment, below any level that poses a threat
to the safety of plant personnel or the public.''
</P>
<P>
	   Radioactive steam was released for ``a few seconds'' and initially was held
within the plant's containment building, the sealed concrete building that holds
the reactor, Spall said. Later it was determined that some steam also was
released into the air surrounding the plant, Spall said.
</P>
<P>
	   He described the plant as stable but said the alert would last several hours
overnight as the shutoff reactor is cooled.
</P>
<P>
	   Although county officials activated the emergency operations center in White
Plains, they were ``confident the situation is under control,'' county
spokeswoman Adele Dowling said.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident occurred at 7:29 p.m. in a tube used to carry hot, radioactive,
high-pressure water to a pool of cool, non-radioactive water, Spall said. When
the hot water hits the cool water, steam is produced, which turns a turbine and
generates electricity.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal, state and local authorities were notified, Spall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The alert was the first in the plant's 16-year history, Spall said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Supporter in Hostile Territory  </HEADLINE>
   By ALLEN G. BREED Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) -- For the first time since he drove landing craft
tanks in the South Pacific during World War II, Stafford Belk found himself in
enemy territory.
</P>
<P>
	   The 75-year-old former seaman came to Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2889 on
Tuesday to watch the Republican presidential debate and root for his man, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   When he got there, he was surrounded by supporters of U.S. Sen. John McCain.
And leading the charge -- his own son.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Matter of fact, I brought him hoping he'd change his mind,'' said Ruskin
Belk, 46, himself a Navy veteran.
</P>
<P>
	   As the South Carolina GOP primary looms Saturday, Bush and McCain are in a
statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
	   That wasn't so evident in the smoky barroom of the corrugated metal VFW hall
-- it looked as if the McCain camp had done an aerial drop. Bumper stickers lay
thicker than coasters; yard signs were propped against the wall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``America is searching for a hero,'' read a McCain pamphlet next to an open
can of Old Milwaukee. ``South Carolina can point the way.''
</P>
<P>
	   There were even some stickers left over from the aborted Steve Forbes
campaign. But there wasn't a Bush bobble in sight.
</P>
<P>
	   Stafford Belk was uncowed. He said he liked Bush's pedigree.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I liked President Bush before,'' he said. ``I just had a lot of faith in
him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Howard May, fresh from teaching a line dancing class in the next room,
pulled up a stool to watch the debate, but only for a few minutes. He didn't
wait around to give Bush a chance to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm more for a war hero right now than I am for a political hero,'' said
May, 69, a Vietnam vet like McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Hohman watched every minute of the debate, slapping his knees and
laughing at Bush's performance. He successfully anticipated several of Bush's
answers, mouthing along word for word.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need someone in office to take over this country right now,'' said
Hohman, 56, a former submarine tender who now restores old airplanes. ``With all
the turmoil this world is in, a governor can't just step in. ... I can just see
him trying to learn to be president. I don't need that right now.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sitting nearby, Ruskin Belk leaned into his father's shoulder. ``What do you
think about Bush now?'' he whispered. ``Do you see what I've been talking
about?''
</P>
<P>
	   Bartender Lori Costner mocked Bush's talk about his experience running
Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Big things come from Texas, don't they babe?'' she asked, blowing a cloud
of smoke.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yeah, egos,'' replied John Patty, 52, another Navy veteran. ``You can tell
he's got a big ego -- about as big as his state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Plyler, his head wrapped in an American flag bandana, sat with his
arms folded across his chest, carefully listening to every word. In the end, the
56-year-old Vietnam veteran said both Bush and McCain ``talked in circles.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Alan Keyes is the only one who's said anything,'' he said. ``The only
reason I wouldn't vote for him is I feel it would be throwing my vote away. I
think John McCain is electable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes is running a distant third, and Plyler said he wouldn't mind seeing a
McCain-Keyes ticket in the fall. ``I think that'd be quite a combination
there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Patty, who said he was ``registered as an American,'' came into the debate
undecided. He now is leaning a little farther toward McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bush, this is the third debate I've watched him in. I really tried to
support him at first, I really did. But he doesn't give the right answers,''
Patty said.
</P>
<P>
	   One person Bush had no hope of luring away from McCain was post
quartermaster Johnnie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I voted today -- absentee ballot,'' said Robinson, 69, an independent who
voted to re-elect President Clinton in 1998. ``I know he's got one vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for the battle of the Belks, McCain seemed to have gained some ground.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What do you think?'' the son asked the father following the debate.
``What's it going to be?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A close race,'' the elder replied. ``I'm going to have to think about it.
It's a tie between the two of them.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now he's not sure,'' the son said. ``All right. That's all I can ask.''

<HEADLINE> Rivers Says Jokes Not Mean Spirited  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Plenty of celebrities have gotten their feelings hurt
over Joan Rivers' caustic jokes.
</P>
<P>
	   But the comedian denies that her wisecracks, which have targeted everyone
from Mariah Carey to Willie Nelson, are mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
	   "People say this and it hurts me so much," said Rivers. "They say, 'You're
so mean. And I say, 'Me? Why?' Because I say Elizabeth Taylor is fat. Everybody
says that. They just remember me because I had the better jokes.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never want to hurt anyone. That's why I don't go after people in the
audience. I only go after stars; I go after people who it doesn't matter one bit
to."
</P>
<P>
	   Rivers, known for her acerbic reviews of fashions at various awards shows,
says stars who take her critiques seriously "are idiots."
</P>
<P>
	   Rivers' comments were published in Tuesday's editions of the News &AMP; Observer
of Raleigh in advance of her lecture here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The comedian said she joined the lecture circuit about 2 1/2 years ago after
audience members began asking her serious questions during live performances.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd be in Vegas doing stand-up and someone would say, 'Can I ask you
something?' And I'd say 'Sure.' And some woman would say 'My husband just killed
himself. What should I do?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Rivers' husband, Edgar Rosenberg, killed himself in 1987.

just a mouse click or a phone call away.
</P>
<P>
	   "A disproportionate amount of our business is through catalogs and e-sales,"
the Motor City Madman said in Tuesday's editions of The Jackson Citizen Patriot.
"This is a progressive move."
</P>
<P>
	   Ted Nugent United Sportsmen of America and his other ventures, such as Ted
Nugent's Kamp for Kids, are being consolidated at his Concord ranch. Nugent says
he's also outsourcing his sporting goods catalog business because of continued
growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Nugent and his band are rehearsing for one of his biggest tours
in a decade. He'll do more than 100 concert dates with '70s rockers KISS.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Control of House Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A nationwide political offensive being planned this week
by the unions will be crucial to wrestling the control of Congress away from
Republicans, Democratic Party leaders are telling labor chiefs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very important. It's critical to our efforts,'' said House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who met with the AFL-CIO's governing committee
Tuesday. ``Six seats is all we need, but I also told them there's nothing done
yet, we've got to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
	   House Democratic Whip David Bonior of Michigan, at the labor meeting with
Gephardt, said that if Democrats do get power back, one of the top priorities
will be to pass laws to make it easier for workers to unionize.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The law is such that it's just so cumbersome to have workers recognized,''
and too easy for companies to thwart them, Bonior said.
</P>
<P>
	   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said the labor federation sees this as ``a
watershed'' election year and ``we are conducting the broadest and most
intensive program we have ever conducted'' to try to influence congressional
campaigns. The AFL-CIO has budgeted $40 million for the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO has so far picked out 71 candidates in House districts to
support this year. Of those, only one is a Republican, incumbent Rep. Bob Ney of
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats are mounting a strong challenge to win control of the House in the
fall elections, and are counting on assistance from organized labor, among other
allies.
</P>
<P>
	   The current House has 222 Republicans, 211 Democrats and two independents,
one aligned with each of the two major parties. A switch of six seats next fall
would deliver control of the House to Democrats. Political strategists in both
parties say the battle for a majority is likely to be decided by as few as 35 or
40 races scattered around the country.
</P>
<P>
	   AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal said that there's no denying
unions would like to see labor-friendly Democrats, who lost control of the House
in 1994, win it back.
</P>
<P>
	   But since expectations are that if they do, it will be by a small margin,
Rosenthal said, ``We are (also) aggressively seeking pro-worker Republicans
across the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the Senate, where chances of a Democratic takeover are considered
slimmer, the AFL-CIO has so far committed its muscle to about a dozen
candidates, all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, key states with large union membership have been earmarked as
crucial to the presidential campaign of Vice President Al Gore, who the AFL-CIO
has endorsed. Among these are Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania
and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   Sweeney said the labor federation has already mobilized 1,600 local union
political activists across the country -- compared with about 450 for the 1998
congressional elections -- to lead a campaign that will rely more heavily than
in the past on one-on-one contact between union members.
</P>
<P>
	   That will include biweekly leafleting at job sites between April and August
and door-to-door campaigning. The goal is to double the percentage of the
AFL-CIO's 13 million members who get one of these personal contacts from 11
percent in 1998 to 22 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Union women will be a focus of AFL-CIO outreach, starting at a March kickoff
conference in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Low-income, so-called ``waitress moms'' are seen as an important swing-vote
group this year. They have ``the most sensitivity, the greatest volatility''
said Karen Nussbaum, director of the AFL-CIO Working Women's Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO is also launching a new Internet access service this month that
union households can purchase for $14.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   An alternative to commercial services like America Online, it will include
political features such as online voter registration forms, cyber-chats with
candidates and a how-to on becoming a presidential nominating delegate.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Court Sentences Official  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A deputy governor of a southern Chinese province has been
sentenced to death for amassing a fortune in bribes, many of them from
provincial companies, state media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ending a two-day trial, the Intermediate People's Court in Nanchang city on
Tuesday ordered that Hu Changqing be put to death for taking bribes worth
$658,000 over four years while serving first as a cabinet official in charge of
religious policy and then as deputy governor of Jiangxi.
</P>
<P>
	   Hu is one of the highest officials to be sentenced in a campaign China's
Communist Party leaders have waged for several years against pervasive
corruption. Chinese leaders hope the campaign -- and the prosecution of
high-profile miscreants like Hu -- will help restore the party's waning
credibility.
</P>
<P>
	   Major national newspapers splashed Hu's conviction and sentencing on their
front pages Wednesday in a sign of the attention Chinese leaders want his
punishment to attract.
</P>
<P>
	   Hu took bribes more than 90 times from 18 people and companies in Jiangxi,
the People's Daily reported. Among the gifts were U.S. and Hong Kong dollars,
fully convertible unlike China's yuan, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The court found that Hu had $192,000 in property he could not account for
and also had given $9,700 in bribes to further his career, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-judge panel ruled that Hu be put to death and all his property be
confiscated, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hu Changqing's taking and giving bribes and his unclear sources of
property is an extremely serious case involving a high-level leading cadre. Its
nature is serious, its character pernicious and its effect on society harmful,''
said the People's Daily, the authoritative newspaper of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the publicity given to Hu's case, Chinese leaders carefully control
the release of information about the misdeeds of high-level officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The wholly state-controlled media has been almost silent on an investigation
into smuggling in southeastern Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
	   That case has been called China's biggest corruption scandal since the
communists came to power 50 years ago.

<HEADLINE> College Basketball Roundup  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- It made perfect sense to Mateen Cleaves:
Michigan State needs more 3-pointers to win the Big Ten for the third straight
time.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleaves made three of the No. 6 Spartans' eight 3s as they took over sole
possession of first place in the conference with an 83-72 win over No. 7 Ohio
State on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "That gives us another weapon," said Cleaves, who stays up to 40 minutes
after practice to shoot 3-pointers. "I think a lot of teams have been playing me
to pass. I think it's important that I go out there and knock a few shots down."
</P>
<P>
	   Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien, ejected 5 1/2 minutes into the second half,
said the Buckeyes would rather have Cleaves firing from long range than driving
the lane.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not only does he get in and create contact and make baskets, but he gets
everybody else involved," O'Brien said. "So you have to give something up, and
tonight he made a few baskets."
</P>
<P>
	   In the only other game involving a ranked team, No. 11 Florida beat Arkansas
80-71.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brien felt it was a costly defeat, even though the Buckeyes are still in
the chase for the conference title.
</P>
<P>
	   "They (the Spartans) still have some tough games. So do we," O'Brien said.
"It all depends on how everybody plays."
</P>
<P>
	   The Spartans (19-6, 9-2) were 7-of-9 on 3-pointers while rolling to a 44-33
halftime lead. They finished 8-for-20 for the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Ohio State (17-5, 8-3), which fell into a tie with Indiana and Purdue, never
got closer than seven points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, it wasn't for lack of trying.
</P>
<P>
	   Scoonie Penn was 5-of-10 from 3-point range on his way to 30 points for the
Buckeyes. That was a season-high and matched Penn's career high. Michael Redd
added 18 points for the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to give Ohio State a lot of credit," Michigan State coach Tom Izzo
said. "Scoonie and Michael came back and hit some big shots, and it seemed like
we could put it away, but we just couldn't put it away."
</P>
<P>
	   Morris Peterson had 26 points and 11 rebounds for his fifth double-double.
Cleaves finished with 24 points and Charlie Bell added 23 for the Spartans, who
forced 14 turnovers and came up with eight steals.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is definitely going to stand out," said Peterson, who scored 20 points
in a 78-67 loss at Ohio State on Jan. 20. "Years from now, when I'm done
playing, I'll still enjoy this one."
</P>
<P>
	   It was the 25th straight win at home for the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody had to tell us this was an important game," Bell said. "We were
trying to protect home floor, and this was for first place in the Big Ten. I
don't think you need too much more motivation than that."
</P>
<P>
	   The importance of this game was apparent from the opening tip. Both teams
made it to the Final Four last season and played like a No. 1 seed in this
season's tournament might be at stake, even though O'Brien denied it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not concerned with a No. 1 seed," O'Brien said. "We're still trying
to get into the (NCAA) tournament. I don't know how anybody else feels, but I
don't think we're a lock for the tournament by any means."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brien was ejected by referee Tom O'Neill after picking up his second
technical foul. Assistant Rick Boyages ran the team the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   "First of all, I did not like the way I was being treated by O'Neill,"
O'Brien said. "There were no obscenities. He just called a technical on me from
across the way.
</P>
<P>
	   "On the second one, I was trying to get his attention, and he just refused
to acknowledge me. He just kept walking away. I tapped him on the shoulder."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neill said coaches are supposed to stay in the huddle during timeouts.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Jimmy getting ejected was, believe it or not, disappointing," Izzo
said, "because I think he is a class guy and a good guy."
</P>
<P>
	   Ohio State and Michigan State each have four regular-season games remaining.
On Saturday, the Spartans are home against Wisconsin, while the Buckeyes travel
to No. 10 Indiana.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Miller had 19 points as Florida won at Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gators (19-5, 8-3) fell behind 8-0, then took the lead for good seven
minutes into the first half. Kenyan Weeks, 43-of-44 from the foul line this
season, made four late free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Johnson had 15 points for Arkansas (13-11, 5-6).

<HEADLINE> Mexico Oil Output Restrictions Ease  </HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRUP Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Worried that its economy will be hurt if oil prices go
too far up or down, Mexico will tread lightly as producers move toward easing
crude output restrictions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The restrictions, agreed upon last year in a successful bid to raise oil
prices, expire at the end of March. Once they do, producers are likely to
increase output to counter low world inventories and high prices, Mexican Energy
Minister Luis Tellez said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico has an idea of how much more crude should be put on the market, he
said, but he declined to name a figure. Discussions were continuing with other
producers, and Tellez was scheduled to meet his counterparts from Venezuela and
Saudi Arabia on March 2.
</P>
<P>
	   High oil prices might start inflationary pressures that could decelerate the
world economy. That would have ``a negative effect on our level of exports, on
our balance of payments and on our level of employment and economic activity,''
Tellez has said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the government's reliance on oil for nearly one-third of its income
cannot easily be brushed aside. Low prices led to more than $3 billion being
slashed from the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the federal government collected $1.4 billion more than it had
expected, with state oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos, or PEMEX, selling its
crude at an average price of $15.62 a barrel, well above the budget projection
of $9.75 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, the government has budgeted for $16 a barrel, while its crude
basket has averaged around $24 so far -- an indicator that the government
doesn't expect current levels to hold.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew Cunagin of Salomon Smith Barney said lower oil prices as the year
progresses are more likely to hit Mexico on the trade side.
</P>
<P>
	   Wider deficits could pressure the Mexican currency, Cunagin said. ``Oil is
supporting the trade numbers,'' he added. Mexico's petroleum exports grew 39
percent in 1999 to $9.92 billion, helping to limit the overall trade deficit to
$5.36 billion from $7.91 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, they are pleased with high prices,'' Cunagin said.

FBI Seeks Hackers in Web Attacks

WTO Chief: Real Free Trade Is Best
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Appealing to rich nations to open up their
markets, the chief of the World Trade Organization said Tuesday that aid
handouts cannot help the poorest countries as much as selling goods in real free
trade. Mike Moore told the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development that trade
could be a force for peace in the world, but for it to work, everyone has to
have access and the gaps between rich and poor countries must narrow. The gaps
are growing in the rapidly globalizing, high-tech economy, Moore said, urging
rich nations to help the least developed countries catch up by lowering trade
barriers to their exports.

<HEADLINE> Gore on Tape at Fund-Raiser Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore on videotape. Testimony about an
envelope containing $100,000 in donations.
</P>
<P>
	   A jury at the federal courthouse Tuesday heard the echoes of the 1996
campaign fund-raising scandal with testimony from former Democratic Party
operative John Huang and featuring a Gore video, his appearance at a
controversial Buddhist temple fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore tape was played by lawyers for ex-Democratic fund-raiser Maria
Hsia, who is on trial for what prosecutors describe as a scheme to illegally
reimburse contributors for more than $100,000 in donations they made to the
Clinton-Gore '96 campaign and the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles immigration consultant and former colleague of Huang is
charged with five felony counts of causing false statements to be filed with the
Federal Election Commission about the true source of campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
	   Hsia's lawyer, Nancy Luque, said Hsia had no idea the Buddhist temple
reimbursed some of the donors at the fund-raiser which Gore attended. When
questions first arose during the 1996 campaign, Gore said he didn't even know
the event was a fund-raiser, that he thought it was community outreach.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore tape, which Luque played for the jury to underscore that there was
no actual fund-raising during the vice president's appearance, shows the vice
president entering the California temple. The vice president is seen, though not
heard, speaking to a crowd, with a commentator describing the vice president's
remarks in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
	   Huang testified that Gore was in on the event from its very inception.
</P>
<P>
	   Huang described how he, Hsia and the head of the Buddhist sect from Taiwan
visited the vice president at the White House in the spring of 1996, laying the
groundwork for what became the temple fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The vice president gave the master (Gore's) book'' as a gift and ``the
master invited the vice president to visit the temple. ... The vice president
said he'd love to go and that he'd like to bring one of his daughters,'' Huang
testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Huang said the temple fund-raiser had been planned as a community outreach
event, the same term Gore initially used to describe it. But Huang said the
temple event turned into a fund-raiser when two planned stops by Gore were
combined into one because of constraints on the vice president's time.
</P>
<P>
	   Huang said he was concerned that the temple fund-raiser was producing only
meager rewards, $30,000 to $40,000, far less of the $200,000 to $250,000 that
usually flowed into Democratic coffers whenever Gore showed up at an event.
</P>
<P>
	   Huang said that on the day after the fund-raiser he ``mentioned'' to Hsia
that ``I hoped I could bring back $100,000.'' He said Hsia subsequently told him
to meet her at the temple at 10 at night before Huang flew back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Huang said that at the meeting in a temple reception room, Hsia ``handed me
an envelope; she mentioned 'this is $100,000,' I just took it with me and went
with my wife to the airport.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hsia's lawyers have described her as a community activist trying to help
newcomers to the United States, while Justice Department prosecutors have
depicted her as combining her immigration consulting business with political
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
	   Under questioning by prosecutor Eric Yaffe, Huang testified that Hsia
recommended that she be seated next to Immigration and Naturalization Service
Commissioner Doris Meissner at a Democratic Party fund-raiser at the Hay Adams
Hotel attended by President Clinton on Feb. 19, 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors introduced a photograph of Hsia standing next to Meissner at the
event.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Came With Little Notice  </HEADLINE>
   By ERIN McCLAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- Howling wind and lashing rain were Eugene Lewis' only
warnings in the minutes before a tornado tore his mobile home to shreds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was in bed, ready to go to sleep,'' he said. ``Then I heard it.''
</P>
<P>
	   What he heard was Georgia's deadliest tornado system in more than 50 years.
Lewis only had time to huddle his family and pray in Monday's predawn hours.
</P>
<P>
	   No one in the house was seriously hurt, but other families weren't as lucky.
The twisters killed as many as 22 people, according to reports from emergency
crews, hospital officials and relatives. The state put the number killed at 19.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton declared disaster areas Tuesday in four southwest Georgia
counties, making federal funding available to help people and business owners
recover from the storms.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, Gov. Roy Barnes and James Lee Witt, director of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, were expected to arrive in Camilla today to
assess damage and detail plans for government aid.
</P>
<P>
	   The Insurance Information Institute estimated the total Georgia storm damage
at $25 million, including homes, chicken coops, small businesses and farmland.
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasters say they provided as much warning as possible, but people here
still had only minutes to leave their homes -- if they received warning at all.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike most tornadoes, which hit in afternoon, these killer storms came in
under a cloak of darkness -- long after many people near Camilla had turned off
their televisions and gone to sleep.
</P>
<P>
	   Most televisions were off and radios were silent in Mitchell County when the
National Weather Service broadcast its first tornado warnings for the area 40
minutes before the first twister touched down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You couldn't ask for any worse time for a tornado to strike,'' said Robbie
Hopkins, assistant coordinator of Mitchell County's emergency management agency.
``It was dark, people were asleep, and the gates of hell opened.''
</P>
<P>
	   Unincorporated Mitchell County has no siren warning system for natural
disasters. The small town of Camilla has such a system, but the storm caused
most of its damage well out of earshot of the sirens, said 911 director Jim
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was nothing you could do about it,'' said Earnestine Norwood, whose
family managed to ride out the storm unscathed. Like hundreds of others, she was
picking through debris Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasters are confident their storm-chasing technology gave emergency
management officials and people in the storm's path as much warning as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The software within the system helps us generate warnings very quickly and
be very specific,'' meteorologist Paul Duval said Tuesday. ``It works great.''
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency management teams and forecasters say the surest way to reach
people in tornado danger is by weather radio -- a small box that sounds an alarm
for local warnings.
</P>
<P>
	   The cheapest weather radio costs about $35, but they don't sell well in
Camilla, said Ann Howard, manager of a Wal-Mart about a mile from the storm's
worst damage.
</P>
<P>
	   And the weather service's high-tech radar, which has made a quantum leap in
the past 10 years, was of little use to storm victims who weren't watching
television.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The best warning in the world doesn't do any good if the people that need
to hear it don't hear it,'' Duval said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hopkins said Mitchell County public safety officials will begin an extensive
review of the county's warning plans for natural disasters after cleanup is well
under way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's always room to improve,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Sequoia Protection  </HEADLINE>
   By H.JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to protect forever California's remaining giant
sequoia redwoods, President Clinton is considering setting aside as much as
400,000 acres of federal forests in central California as a protected monument.
</P>
<P>
	   The president asked Agriculture Secretary Daniel Glickman on Tuesday to
explore the idea of using the 1906 Antiquities Act to protect the giant trees
and report back to him within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to ensure that these majestic cathedral groves ... are protected
for future generations to study and enjoy,'' Clinton wrote the agriculture
secretary, whose department controls much of the land on which the last of the
giant redwoods stand.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists for years have campaigned to impose greater protection to
the sequoia trees -- about 70 groves in all -- that are located in Kings Canyon,
Sequoia and Yosemite national parks and nearby Sequoia National Forest and other
government land in the Sierra Mountains of central California.
</P>
<P>
	   While about a third of the groves are protected within the national park
systems, the rest -- except for one privately owned grove -- are in the national
forest or other government land and they could be endangered by future logging
or other development. Environmentalists fear that while the trees themselves are
forbidden to be cut, nearby logging could threaten their long-term existence.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's action ``is a recognition that there is a major gap in the
protection of this very, very important and majestic species. That gap needs to
be filled,'' George Frampton, chairman of the president's Council on
Environmental Quality, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The sequoia redwoods -- not as tall as the California redwoods, but with
massive trucks as much as 100 feet wide at the base -- are among the oldest
living things on earth. Many of the remaining trees are several thousand years
old. They once were scattered across much of the Northern Hemisphere, but now
grow only on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in central
California.
</P>
<P>
	   Frampton said the intent would be to protect 330,000 to 440,000 acres of
land as a national monument, or about a third of the Sequoia National Forest, to
ensure permanent protection of the ecosystem that surrounds the giant trees. He
said the monument designation would protect 70 remaining groves, including 35
groves in the Sequoia National Forest, as well as 25 groves in the nearby
national parks and the rest on other federal land.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a fabulous thing,'' said Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope.
``These trees are very vulnerable to any kind of disruption. This is an
incredible big gain for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Creation of (such a monument) would be a world class gift to the American
people,'' said Nathaniel Lawrence, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council. He called it ``a world class gift to the American people'' and said
``this swath of sequoia country should have been permanently protected long
ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has used the Antiquities Act before to carve out land for special
protection, each time meeting strong criticism from some western lawmakers and
local officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Clinton used the backdrop of the Grand Canyon to announce the
designation of a million acres of cliffs, desert and scenic areas adjacent to
the canyon as the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument. He also extended
monument protection to 71,000 acres of American Indian ruins north of Phoenix
and to hundreds small islands up and down the California coast. Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt has a list of about a dozen more contenders for monument
status.
</P>
<P>
	   Three years ago, Clinton raised a firestorm when he used the 1906 law to
establish the 1.9 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument in southern
Utah. Some Utah officials called it a federal ``land grab.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 1906 law allows presidents, without congressional approval, to safeguard
objects of historic and scientific interest. President Theodore Roosevelt used
it to set aside the Grand Canyon in 1908 and President Carter invoked it to
establish large sections of Alaska wilderness in the 1970s. Over the years, only
Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush declined to use the law.

<HEADLINE> 'ER' Reclaims Nielsens Top Spot  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A stabbing involving two main characters on "ER" last week
drew so many viewers to the NBC drama that it edged "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" for the ratings top spot.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, "Millionaire" continues to be a ratings bonanza for ABC. The game
show drew more than 30 million viewers twice last week and nearly 28 million the
other time, giving the network another weekly win in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
	   "ER" ended its ratings sweeps month episode in a cliffhanger after both Noah
Wyle's and Kellie Martin's characters were left clinging to life. Since Martin
has already announced that she's leaving the series, it's wise not to place bets
on her survival.
</P>
<P>
	   The episode drew 31 million viewers, well above the "ER" season average of
24 million.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS's "60 Minutes" had its best ratings of the year, after it reran a
profile of "Peanuts" creator Charles Schulz on Sunday night, less than 24 hours
after he died.
</P>
<P>
	   Two movies performed well last week: ABC's "Mary and Rhoda" reunion drew 17
million viewers, and CBS's re-enactment of Thomas Jefferson's romance with Sally
Hemings had 19 million people watching.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC's "The Practice" continued the ratings momentum it generated with its
episode after the Super Bowl, but the news wasn't as good for another
long-running ABC drama. "NYPD Blue" lost in its time slot to CBS's "Judging Amy"
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week, ABC had 14.9 million viewers (9.9 rating, 16 share). NBC was
second with 13.5 million viewers (9.3 rating, 15 share), and beat ABC among
18-to-49-year-olds. CBS had 12.9 million (8.9, 14), Fox had 9.7 million (6.4,
10), UPN had 4.3 million (2.9, 5), the WB had 3.9 million (2.8, 4), and Pax TV
had 1 million (0.8, 1).
</P>
<P>
	   NBC's "Nightly News" led the evening news competition with 11.2 million
viewers (8.3 rating, 16 share), ABC's "World News Tonight" had 10.9 million
viewers (8.0, 16) and the "CBS Evening News" had 9.8 million viewers (7.2, 14).
</P>
<P>
	   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's
estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use
televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Feb. 7-13, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings
were:
</P>
<P>
	   "ER," NBC, 20.9; "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Tuesday), ABC, 19.2; "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Sunday), ABC, 17.8; "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"
(Thursday), ABC, 17.7; "Friends," NBC, 15.4; "60 Minutes," CBS, 14.9; "Frasier,"
NBC, 14.1; "CBS Sunday Movie: Sally Hemings: American Scandal," CBS, 13.5; "ABC
Monday Night Movie: Mary and Rhoda," ABC, 13.3; "The Practice," ABC, 12.9;
"Touched By an Angel," CBS, 12.9.

<HEADLINE> 'American Beauty' Leads Oscar Nods  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The nominations are out and the 40-day
countdown to the Oscar ceremony has begun. Already, though, winners and losers
are apparent.
</P>
<P>
	   The victors in Tuesday's nomination process were "American Beauty," "The
Cider House Rules," "The Green Mile," "The Insider" and "The Sixth Sense" -- all
poised to cash in on the ubiquitous advertising phrase: "Nominated for Best
Picture."
</P>
<P>
	   The losers are acclaimed films that had been among the frontrunners but
failed to grab armfuls of nominations, including "The Hurricane," which took
only one nod, for lead actor Denzel Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Studios now will gear up to make hay on two fronts: Marketing their Oscar
success to lure new viewers to their movies and selling Academy voters on the
notion that their films are the most deserving of the coveted statuettes come
March 26.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney, whose films include "The Sixth Sense" and "The Insider," led all
studios with 17 nominations. The Disney-owned independent distributor, Miramax,
was second with 14.
</P>
<P>
	   The two best-picture nominees that have not been widely seen by the public,
"The Cider House Rules" and "The Insider," have the most to gain, whether at the
box office or eventual video release.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Insider," the story of tobacco whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand, grossed a
disappointing $26.7 million in wide distribution, while "Cider House" has taken
in $22.7 million in more narrow release.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cider House" distributor Miramax has become an expert in capitalizing on
Oscar nominations with such recent winners as "Shakespeare in Love," "Life Is
Beautiful" and "The English Patient."
</P>
<P>
	   Now playing in about 800 theaters, "Cider House" will expand to twice that
many by next week and could go wider after that, said Mark Gill, Miramax West
Coast president.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a really satisfying movie that never has had huge heat on it," Gill
said. "It's always been this gentle discovery of a film as opposed to one where
people think you must go see this now. Now all of a sudden the nominations
hopefully will give audiences an urgency to see it."
</P>
<P>
	   "American Beauty" led all contenders with eight nominations, including nods
for lead actors Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening and director Sam Mendes. "Cider
House" and "The Insider" had seven each, and "The Sixth Sense" received six.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. theater count has dwindled to a handful for "American Beauty" since
its debut last September, but its awards success has prompted distributor
DreamWorks to re-release it to 1,200 cinemas Friday. The modestly budgeted movie
stands to add millions to the $75 million it already has grossed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oscar race could shape up into a replay of last year's slugfest between
Miramax with "Shakespeare in Love" and DreamWorks with "Saving Private Ryan."
Like last year, DreamWorks heads into awards season with the generally
acknowledged frontrunner in "American Beauty."

<P>
	   Miramax' aggressive marketing, though, helped "Shakespeare" win best picture
last year over "Saving Private Ryan." This year's battle to woo Academy voters
promises to be equally fierce among DreamWorks, Miramax and studios for the
other nominees.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides "The Hurricane," another notable Oscar disappointment was "Man on
the Moon," which was shut out entirely. Star Jim Carrey was overlooked again
after last year's Oscar snub for "The Truman Show."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Spacey and Washington, the other best-actor nominees were
Russell Crowe for "The Insider," Richard Farnsworth for "The Straight Story" and
Sean Penn for "Sweet and Lowdown."
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Bening, the other best-actress category included Janet McTeer in
"Tumbleweeds," Julianne Moore in "The End of the Affair," Meryl Streep in "Music
of the Heart" and Hilary Swank in "Boys Don't Cry."
</P>
<P>
	   Acting nominations also can help draw in new viewers, especially for such
narrowly seen movies as "Tumbleweeds" and "Boys Don't Cry." McTeer said she
hopes the Oscar attention will boost her film, which has grossed just $1.3
million.
</P>
<P>
	   "We made this little movie for a cough and a spit, meaning for nothing,"
McTeer said. "We did it for love because we wanted to make it hoping somebody
would distribute it. Now here we are at the Oscars. I think that's the funniest
thing I ever heard."

<HEADLINE> Nations Vie for Foreign Film Oscar  </HEADLINE>
    By CYNTHIA L. WEBB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The latest foreign language Oscar nominations answered
11 years of anticipation for Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar and gave Nepal
its first bid in the category.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is something very mysterious about the awards -- a lot of times it
has nothing to do with quality," said Almodovar, speaking by phone from his
office in Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   Almodovar's "All About My Mother" is the first of his many acclaimed films
to receive a nomination since "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" in
1988.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was waiting for 11 years to win another nomination," said the director,
whose films are famous for outlandish characters and complex story lines.
</P>
<P>
	   His latest film is vying for an Oscar with films from four other countries:
"Caravan" from Nepal; "East-West" from France; "Solomon and Gaenor" a
Welsh-language film from the United Kingdom; and Sweden's "Under the Sun."
</P>
<P>
	   "All About My Mother," a woman's painful journey into her past after the
death of her son, weaves the stories of strong female characters -- an Almodovar
trademark. There's an aging lesbian actress, a transvestite homemaker and a nun
with HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   The film won Almodovar the award for best director at the Cannes Film
Festival, and has been well-received in Britain and the United States. It won
the foreign Golden Globe in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Director Regis Wargnier, whose 1992 film "Indochine" received an Oscar
nomination, said he was walking in a Paris garden when he found out his latest
film, "East-West," was nominated.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's a great chance to get this twice," said Wargnier, 51.
</P>
<P>
	   "East-West" is a 1940s romantic drama about a Russian emigre who returns to
the Soviet Union with his son and French wife after the war, only to encounter
an unexpected reality under Stalin.
</P>
<P>
	   "Solomon and Gaenor" marks the first time director Paul Morrison has been
nominated. The film is about a young Jewish man in Wales who is separated from
his lover by anti-Semitic riots in 1911.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a dream to make it and this is even more of a dream to have this
nomination," said Morrison, 55, who learned of his Oscar bid as he ate
minestrone soup in a London cafe.
</P>
<P>
	   "Caravan," directed by Eric Valli, is a tale of conflict between an old
village chieftain and a young man set amid a yak caravan's journey through the
Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
	   "Under the Sun" is Sweden's 12th nomination. Directed by Colin Nutley, it is
the story of a lonely farmer whose want ad for a housekeeper brings a city woman
into his life.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Address Internet TV  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With all the advances in high-speed Internet technology,
Americans may one day be able to watch most TV broadcasts on the Web -- but not
before overcoming some challenging hurdles.
</P>
<P>
	   For one, copyright holders, Internet companies and Congress need to tackle
new thorny licensing issues. By shattering the bounds of geography, the Internet
is also confounding the traditional laws governing copyright protections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Online technology has transformed the way consumers receive information
and entertainment,'' said House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va.,
in remarks prepared for a hearing today. ``Because this transformation
strengthens our economy, it is essential that we ... carefully assess whether
Congress needs to amend current law.''
</P>
<P>
	   The committee's telecommunications panel was examining the issue at a time
when a high-profile legal case has focused attention on Internet providers
``streaming'' live TV broadcasts to their audiences.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, several motion picture studios and TV networks, along with two of
the nation's professional sports leagues, persuaded a judge to prohibit a
Canadian Internet site, called iCraveTV.com, from transmitting live broadcasts
that U.S. audiences can view.
</P>
<P>
	   The premise was that, under Canadian law, iCraveTV could capture programming
-- including NFL games and television sitcoms and dramas -- from stations in
Toronto and Buffalo, N.Y., and rebroadcast them live over the Internet. But when
U.S. viewers began logging on, copyright holders yelled foul.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of the Toronto-based operation assert that they are operating
within their country's copyright laws and are also implementing new safeguards
to ensure that people outside Canada are not viewing the programming. For
example, the company is looking at using software that permits access only to
people that are using Internet providers based in Canada, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are acting in good faith to follow the laws of the country in which we
operate,'' Ian McCallum, a vice president for the company that operates
iCraveTV, will tell the House panel, according to prepared testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. laws are more complicated on this matter. Cable operators and
satellite companies are eligible for special blanket licenses that allow them to
retransmit broadcast programming without getting individual consent from each
company. Instead, the companies pay a portion of their revenues into a fund,
which is distributed to the copyright holders.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, a provision was introduced into a telecommunications bill that
would have prevented Internet service providers from getting these so-called
compulsory licenses. It was eventually removed, with Bliley and others arguing
that the issue needed further discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers and copyright holders see iCraveTV as just the beginning of future
challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee,
called iCraveTV the ``first puffing wind in a storm'' at a conference of
broadcasters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   And copyright holders -- including sports, advertising, TV programming and
film groups -- this week banded together to form an assembly to protect their
interests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are all eager to be part of this revolutionary technological magic. But
we worry lest the great potential, the immense future worth of the Internet
becomes tangled by overt and covert piracy of copyrighted material,'' said Jack
Valenti, president and chief executive officer for the Motion Picture
Association of America, in prepared testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   For its part, iCraveTV says it just wants to provide a new service to
audiences and is not trying to steal viewers from traditional TV broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anyone who has seen video on a 14-17 inch computer monitor will know that
it is not a substitute for television,'' McCallum said.

<HEADLINE> Female Heart, Geography Link Shown  </HEADLINE>
    By VICKI SMITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- A woman's risk of dying from heart disease depends
in part on where she lives, and black women everywhere are in greater peril than
any other ethnic group, a study released today has found.
</P>
<P>
	   Women age 35 and older who live in Mississippi, New York and West Virginia
are more likely to die of heart disease than anywhere else in the United States,
while those in Minnesota, Alaska and Montana are at lowest risk.
</P>
<P>
	   The 200-page atlas produced by West Virginia University and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention is aimed at helping health professionals target
women at risk. Overall, the study found that the U.S. heart disease death rate
between 1991 and 1995 was 401 deaths per 100,000 women.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rather than having to do a cookie-cutter approach to research, we can focus
on trouble spots," said Dr. Lynn Smaha, president of the American Heart
Association and a cardiologist in Sayre, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   Among regions with high rates are Appalachia, the Ohio-Mississippi River
Valley, the Mississippi Delta and the eastern Piedmont, and coastal regions of
Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Smaha said possible reasons for the differing death rates include genetic
variations heavily concentrated in a particular region, amount of exercise,
smoking habits, ethnic diets and other social or cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Social isolation and limited mobility also may be part of the problem in
some high-risk areas, the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-five to 40 percent of women over age 60 and living in the high-risk
eastern U.S. regions had limited mobility and an impaired ability to care for
themselves, the CDC researchers found. In Western states, only about 15 percent
of older women had trouble moving about the house or performing other personal
tasks.
</P>
<P>
	   Black women fared far worse than any other group, regardless of geography,
with 553 deaths per 100,000. Black women had high death rates in Alabama,
Georgia and South Carolina, as well as in pockets scattered throughout the
Northeast, Midwest and parts of Texas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
	   Among white women, there were 388 deaths per 100,000, compared with 265 for
Hispanic women and 221 for Asian and Pacific Islander women.
</P>
<P>
	   Historically, women and minorities have often been ignored in health studies
and fallen into gaps in the health care system.
</P>
<P>
	   "Women and minorities have been lumped in as part of the general population,
but they're different," Smaha said. They have different symptoms, get heart
disease later in life and often receive their information about health in
different ways, Smaha added.
</P>
<P>
	   About 373,000 American women die of heart disease every year -- more than
from all forms of cancer combined, according to the CDC.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher in early trading today as a pair of
strong corporate profit reports lifted technology stocks from their recent
slump.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 20.32 at 10,738.41.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 1.55 at 1,403.60, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 27.38 at
4,448.15.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Applied Materials rose 9 to 175 1/2 after announcing
stronger-than-expected profits and a robust outlook for the coming year. The
company, a leading maker of chip-manufacturing equipment, earned $328.5 million,
or 80 cents per share, in its most recent quarter. Analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 77 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Applied Materials also announced it will split its stock two shares for one
effective March 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Lycos, maker of a popular Internet search engine, rose 5 7/16 to 74 1/2. The
company said late Tuesday it earned 3 cents per share in its fiscal second
quarter, beating analysts' estimates of 1 cent per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, investors' favorites for the past several months, have
struggled in the past three sessions as traders sold shares to lock in profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Dow components, Hewlett-Packard rose 3 3/16 to 128 1/2, almost
outweighing a steep drop by American Express, which was down 3 1/4 to 155 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues were nearly even with
decliners. NYSE volume came to 136.22 million shares, on par with Tuesday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.90 to 546.14.

<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.2 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 1.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Religious Rights Abusers Face Critics  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new government commission on religious freedom abroad
is trying to stop regimes that suppress religions from financing projects with
money from U.S. stock markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department says, however, that trade sanctions such as those
against Sudan, which the commission accuses of persecuting its Christian
minority, do not apply to capital markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom plans to watch new
stock offerings from foreign governments and use its power of persuasion with
the markets -- the only power it has.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine-member commission focused in its first public hearing Tuesday on
abuses against Christians in Sudan, which the United States considers an
exporter of terrorism, and on a Chinese government-owned oil company's projects
in that East African country.
</P>
<P>
	   At Tuesday's hearing, an exiled Sudanese Catholic bishop alleged that a
Sudanese military plane intentionally bombed a school in his district last
Tuesday and killed 14 children. Bishop Macram Max Gassis accused the government
of trying to kill off the country's Roman Catholic minority. ``If you destroy
the fruit, you will have no more trees tomorrow,'' Gassis said.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton described the bombing an outrage and said in a statement
that such events have become commonplace in Sudan's 17-year civil war, which has
claimed 2 million lives.
</P>
<P>
	   The official Sudan News Agency quoted the foreign minister, Mustafa Osman
Ismail, as saying if government bombs did kill children, it was an accident of
war, because rebel fighters had amassed near the elementary school.
</P>
<P>
	   The religious freedom commission, which is to take up abuses of religion in
Russia and China later in the year, has appealed to Clinton to prohibit the
Chinese state oil company and others from using U.S. capital markets to finance
projects in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department insists that existing sanctions against Sudan cannot
apply to capital markets. Sudan is under U.S. sanctions both for allegedly
exporting terrorism and abuse of its Christian minority.
</P>
<P>
	   In view of Treasury's position, Commission members have said they plan to
meet with experts and market managers to explore ``voluntary adoption of human
rights and religious-freedom criteria'' for entry into U.S. stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the commission has appointed a task force to monitor plans by
China National Oil Co. to raise money through a listing on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   PetroChina, owned by the company, is expected to proceed with an initial
public offering in excess of $5 billion in the next several weeks, said Roger
Robinson Jr., a former National Security Council director, now chairman of the
William J. Casey Institute of the Center for Security Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese investment in the 940-mile pipeline from Heglid in southern Sudan to
Port Sudan on the Red Sea, completed in September, is part of the state oil
company's largest overseas venture. The Chinese oil company also helped build a
refinery in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson said the commission needs to evaluate whether the Chinese IPO can
ensure that money raised in U.S. markets are not diverted to the oil company's
project in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   The religious freedom commission was set up to advise the State Department
and the White House on protection of religious freedom around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Organized under a 1998 law that arose partly out of rising congressional
unease about alleged persecution of Christians abroad, it is headed by Rabbi
David Saperstein and George Washington University Law School Dean Michael K.
Young and includes people of Christian, Muslim and Baha'i faiths.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the law that created the panel, the State Department has designated
China, Iran, Iraq, Burma and Sudan as ``countries of particular concern'' for
religious freedom. That designation subjects them to diplomatic and economic
sanctions. The department also lists Serbia and the Taliban movement that rules
most of Afghanistan as ``particularly severe violators of religious freedom.''

<HEADLINE> Builders Criticize Republicans  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A solidly Republican crowd of builders and contractors
gave House Speaker Dennis Hastert a rough time today over his decision to pull a
bill aimed at helping small businesses under attack from government regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been a victim of frivolous lawsuits,'' said Michael Uremovich of
Manhattan, Ill., breaking into a speech by Hastert, R-Ill., to the Associated
Builders and Contractors. ``We feel like we've been let down.''
</P>
<P>
	   House GOP leaders late Tuesday decided to take off this week's schedule a
bill that would have permitted small businesses and labor groups to recover
attorney's fees when they win cases brought against them by the National Labor
Relations Board and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert told the ABC, which had made the bill its top legislative priority
of the year, that major labor organizations had solidified Democratic
opposition, some Republicans were against it and they simply didn't have the
votes to pass it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't want to have to debate you on this but ... if you put a bill on
the floor and lose, and you get people locked into a position, you'll never get
it back on the floor,'' Hastert told Uremovich.
</P>
<P>
	   Uremovich, who said he does work in Hastert's district, said his company
spent $250,000 to win a case filed against it by the NLRB. To cheers and
applause from the audience, he said the builders' group had 500 people on
Capitol Hill Tuesday lobbying for the legislation, adding, ``When would there be
a better time than yesterday to get this bill to the floor?''
</P>
<P>
	   Others also rose to say they had been hit by legal expenses. One delegate
from Kansas said, ``we all ought to be in Congressman (Tom) DeLay's office
immediately after this breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
	   DeLay, R-Texas, the House Republican whip, was scheduled to address the
builders but canceled, citing a scheduling conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC national president Tom Musser said he was ``very, very disappointed''
that Congress was failing to act on ``frivolous lawsuits that maybe half of us
in this room have been fighting.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said that as a result his group was ``going to be very, very selective
with our PAC (political action committee) money,'' with only those committed to
its causes getting financial help. The decision not to take up the bill ``caused
us to really draw a line in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am going to the leadership offices today to voice ABC's official
complaint'' about the pulling of the bill, Musser said.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation was opposed by the AFL-CIO as an anti-worker attempt to
discourage the NLRB and the Labor Department from pursuing cases that they can't
be absolutely sure of winning.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Georgine, president of the AFL-CIO's building and construction trade
department, said in a statement before the decision to pull the bill that the
labor organization also welcomed a vote because ``we'll be using it to determine
who supports working families and who doesn't.''

</P>
<P>
	   Many investors remained on edge over concerns that the rapid growth of the
U.S. economy will persuade the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest
rates to raise the cost of borrowing money and force a slowdown. The Fed, which
has raised rates four times since last June, fears the booming economy will
eventually spark a rise in inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The U.S. economy doesn't seem to be slowing down at all," said Alan

continue to climb a wall of worry over higher interest rates."
</P>

fluctuations, were mostly lower today. American Express fell 5 1/8 to 154.
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Gun Risk in Public Housing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public-housing residents are more than twice as likely to
be victimized in handgun violence as other Americans, according to a federal
report made public today.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the report from the Department of Housing and Urban Development finds
that levels of crime are dropping in public housing, the nation's 2.6 million
public-housing residents are at disproportionate risk of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
	   While four of 1,000 Americans are victimized annually by gun violence, the
number soars to 10 out of 1,000 for public-housing residents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've succeeded in driving down crime and gun violence around the nation
to make families safer but our job isn't finished yet,'' President Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, there were an estimated 360 gun-related homicides in 66 of the
nation's 100 largest public-housing authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The report is designed to buttress Clinton administration efforts to reduce
gun violence. Clinton's budget requests $280 million for more than 1,000
federal, state and local prosecutors and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
agents assigned solely to enforcing current gun laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Moreover, HUD officials announced plans in December to file a federal
class-action suit from public-housing authorities against the gun industry if
manufacturers fail to enter negotiations designed to increase firearm safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Some promising news, however, was provided in the study culled from crime
data provided by the National Crime Victimization Survey, the Census Bureau and
HUD.
</P>
<P>
	   The crime rate declined in two-thirds of the authorities studied between
1994 and 1997. And 60 percent of the housing authorities saw their own crime
rates drop faster than those of their surrounding cities.

<HEADLINE> On Stage: The Laramie Project  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL KUCHWARA AP Drama Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- In a nearly 90-year-old red brick building that once housed
the city of Denver's trolley cars, a troupe of New York City actors is in
rehearsal, trying to reconstruct a painful moment of recent history.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Laramie Project" is the tale of one town, Laramie, Wyo., and how its
citizens came to terms with the 1998 beating death of Matthew Shepard, a young
gay man brutalized and then left to die in a lonely field of prairie grass.
</P>
<P>
	   The play tells their stories, drawn from conversations with members of the
Tectonic Theater Project, who created the drama out of more than 200 interviews
and six trips to Wyoming over an 18-month period.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet "The Laramie Project" is the creators' stories, too, the result of an
exhaustive and unique collaboration, one that eventually involved more than a
dozen members of the company as writers, interviewers and actors. Some even
portray themselves on stage.
</P>
<P>
	   After a week of previews, the play opens Feb. 26 at the Denver Theater
Center's 250-seat Ricketson Theater for a five-week run. Denver was an
appropriate venue for the play, Donovan Marley, artistic director of the Center,
says.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is our story." Marley explains. "It is not just the story of Wyoming. It
is the story of Colorado, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico, Arizona and this whole
part of the world. It is a story that just happened to have played out in
Laramie but could just as easily been played out in Fort Collins or Colorado
Springs or Albuquerque. That spurred my interest in it."
</P>
<P>
	   The play's eight actors rehearse in a large, two-story room that has the
feeling of a high school gymnasium rather than a place where theater is being
born. Wooden chairs of various shapes and sizes are scattered across a makeshift
playing area. A row of prairie grass sits oddly off on one side. The simple
setting is designed to focus all your attention on the words, according to set
designer Robert Brill.
</P>
<P>
	   If "The Laramie Project" is a collaboration, its initial spark was ignited
by one man, Moises Kaufman, founder of Tectonic and the author and director of
the off-Broadway hit "Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde." The
play, based, in part, on the trial transcripts, has been done everywhere from
San Francisco to Paris and had a successful, critically praised production last
year at the Denver Theater Center.
</P>
<P>
	   The 36-year-old Kaufman is dark, intense and intellectual. An articulate
outsider. Born an Orthodox Jew in predominately Catholic Venezuela, he grew up
gay in a macho Latin society before moving to New York and finding his place in
the city's downtown Manhattan theater scene. He created Tectonic in 1991.
Tectonic -- which takes its name from the art and science of structure -- made
the big jump into mainstream visibility with "Gross Indecency" in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaufman's conversation grows expansive when he talks about theater. It is
conversation studded with such names as Bertolt Brecht, Jerzy Grotowski, Peter
Brook -- theatrical innovators willing to challenge conventions of the day. So
does Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
	   Words and ideas tumble out as he tries to explain why Shepard's death in
October 1998 captured his attention and the murder's parallels to the Wilde
trials.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there are certain moments in history that become watershed
moments," Kaufman says during a break in rehearsals. "Sometimes an event happens
that serves as a lightning rod to all those ideas, ideologies and concepts by
which a community, a society or a civilization lives. And when you look at that
event, you see not only the event, you see all of the forces that are at play in
the molding of a society."
</P>
<P>
	   The trials of the homosexual Wilde, eventually sent to prison on charges of
"gross indecency," were just such an event, according to Kaufman. Despite being
the lionized author of such 19th-century comedies as "The Importance of Being
Earnest" and "An Ideal Husband," Wilde's life ended in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
	   "The thing that shocked me about the trials of Oscar Wilde was that in
reading the transcripts, you did not only see the story of this man's downfall
but you saw exactly where Victorian society was at in terms of class, gender,
sexuality, the monarchy, imperialism, capitalism. You saw all of it," Kaufman
says.
</P>
<P>
	   "And I think that in the same way, Matthew Shepard's beating, cruel
victimization and murder did a similar thing. It was a moment in our history
where we said, 'Look at what we are doing. Look at where we're at. Look at how
this really is saying something about how we are raising our children."'
</P>
<P>
	   Kaufman says he began "The Laramie Project" on a hunch, the same way he
starts all his productions.
</P>
<P>
	   "Peter Brook talks about 'a hunch,"' he explains. "It's something that you
can't quite articulate until you are there. And then when you do it, you
understand."
</P>
<P>
	   From the beginning, Kaufman knew he wanted the piece -- he didn't know at
first if it was going to be a play -- to be about the town of Laramie, about
what happened there and how its citizens reacted to what occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   "And I thought, 'Well, I can't do this alone. Let's all go,"' he says,
explaining how his whole company became involved in going to Wyoming." Our first
trip was really exploratory. We went there and said, 'Let's conduct interviews
for 10 days and see where we are at the end of it."'
</P>
<P>
	   As Kaufman sums up the project, "The premise is: 'We went, we saw, we return
to tell you what we saw.' Is that possible form for the stage?"
</P>
<P>
	   Funded by profits from "Gross Indecency," Kaufman and several members of the
troupe made their first visit to Laramie in November 1998, one month after
Shepard died.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of Tectonic made six trips in all to Laramie, going out for specific
events such as the court hearings and trials of the two men sentenced for
attacking Shepard after meeting him in a bar. Aaron McKinney and Russell
Henderson, Laramie residents who came from broken homes and worked in fast-food
restaurants and as roofers, are serving life sentences for the murder. Shepard,
a 21-year-old University of Wyoming student, was beaten into a coma and left
tied to a fence. He died five days later.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the actors were journalists, none of them had done interviews before
and none of them knew quite what to expect.
</P>
<P>
	   "We first made a lot of phone calls," says Leigh Fondakowski, assistant
director and head writer on "The Laramie Project." That meant getting in touch
with everybody from the police department to local clergymen to the reporter who
covered the case for the daily newspaper. One contact would lead to another.
</P>
<P>
	   "Many of us went to bars and hung out, talking to people and making
connections that way," Fondakowski says. "By then, most of the press had left
and yet the people didn't feel like they had had any closure. They were very
upset with how they had gotten represented in the press. In some ways, they
weren't finished talking about it either."
</P>
<P>
	   Although a few people were hesitant, Fondakowski was amazed at how willing
most were to talk.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if it was because we weren't press or because we didn't really
know what we were doing," she says. "We would sit down and talk to them for two
hours at a time. I think it had something to do with the way some people felt
they were portrayed in the media as rednecks. They wanted to have that story
'undone' in some way. Maybe they saw us as a way they could do that."
</P>
<P>
	   It also helped that each member of Tectonic was interested in different
aspects of the story, broadening the scope of the collaboration. Fondakowski
wanted to find out more about Shepard and, specifically, what it was like to be
gay in Laramie. Stephen Belber, an actor in the troupe, was interested in
learning about the perpetrators of the crime. Another actor wanted to find out
exactly what happened the night Shepard was beaten.
</P>
<P>
	   All of them audio-taped their interviews, ending up with reels of tapes. "I
spent the last year of my life transcribing," Fondakowski says. "We had this
huge body of material."
</P>
<P>
	   In January, after the first visit to Wyoming, the actors got together and
started reading the transcribed material to each other.
</P>
<P>
	   "We weren't sure until we came back and read all the material, if there was
anything there," says company member Greg Pierotti.
</P>
<P>
	   "It literally was all of us sitting in a room. We had all our transcripts --
stacks of paper all over the place -- and one of us would throw out a topic,
such as, 'Who talked about finding out about the beating?"' Fondakowski says.
</P>
<P>
	   Out of those discussions, the company built collages and from those collages
a script began to form, shaped by Kaufman, Fondakowski and several other company
members. They put together a rough draft of a two-act play in three weeks,
injecting themselves into the process.
</P>
<P>
	   The creators also became part of the play -- seen rather than unseen
observers of how Laramie coped with Shepard's death and its aftermath. Their
effect on the townspeople is also included. One person who is not in "The
Laramie Project" is Shepard himself.
</P>
<P>
	   The play grew from the repeated visits to Laramie, being refined not only in
rehearsals in New York but later at the Sundance Theater Lab in Park City, Utah,
before coming to Denver.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you go to work on an existing script, you learn your lines and you get a
feel for what you need to do, but you can pretty much stay inside your
parameters of comfort," says Pierotti, who was in the original New York cast of
"Gross Indecency."
</P>
<P>
	   "And what has been really amazing about this project is going back to
Laramie," Pierotti says, "constantly being shaken up by what happened, meeting
people I never would have ordinarily met and being stretched in ways that I
never would have been stretched, plus confronting my own stereotypes about the
West and being constantly surprised by the humanity I have been encountering."
</P>
<P>
	   "I just hope we are doing justice to the people we interviewed -- to be able
to participate in a project that is not only exciting creatively, but also is
about something so important," adds company member Amanda Gronich. "And in any
small way, if this play helps to prevent those kind of hate crimes from
happening in the future, what a wonderful thing theater can do."

<HEADLINE> 'Wild Thing' Writer Chip Taylor Back  </HEADLINE>
    By MARY CAMPBELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Most singer-songwriters say they don't know how to do
anything else.
</P>
<P>
	   Not Chip Taylor.
</P>
<P>
	   His father was a professional golfer and he, a junior champ in high school,
turned pro at 19. He wrote some country and pop hits in the 1960s -- "Wild
Thing," "Angel of the Morning," "Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)," "I Can't Let
Go" -- then left music in 1980 to become a professional gambler.
</P>
<P>
	   Now he's back, making what he calls Americana music: folk with a country
flavor and an edge. "I'm having the most wonderful time of my life," he
declares.
</P>
<P>
	   He has a new double CD, "The London Sessions Bootleg +," and he's touring to
promote it in the United States, Canada and Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor, brother of actor Jon Voight, had dual careers for years writing
songs and gambling.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very good at math; math problems are a challenge to me," he says.
"Gambling is much more of a science than anybody thinks it is. I found a formula
that worked, expanded on it and after 1960 I never had a losing year. I was
writing hits, going to the racetrack, recording albums, going to casinos."
</P>
<P>
	   Because he was so successful at blackjack, Atlantic City casinos banned
Taylor in the 1970s. So he concentrated on horses.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had a bunch of records out with me as artist but I never allowed myself
to go on any tours," he says. "I always wanted to stay around the racetrack."
</P>
<P>
	   Now 59, he has reversed priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1995, my Mom got ill. I went one afternoon and played for her instead of
going to the racetrack. I came back the next day, because I loved the feeling we
had together with my music. I did that all week," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I went gambling, my Mom never looked down her nose at me. She was
proud of me. She knew I loved it and was good at it. She encouraged us to do
what was inside us. She also loved to hear me making music ... I realized, this
is what I want to do the rest of my life. I want to play for people."
</P>
<P>
	   That meant saying goodbye to the track.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1996, I called my gambling partner, Ernie Dahlman, and said something
had happened to me and I had to stop gambling and concentrate on making a record
and touring," Taylor says.
</P>
<P>
	   He then made "Hit Man," his first album in 16 years. It and "The Living Room
Tapes" were on the Gadfly label. "Seven Days in May" and the new "London
Sessions" are on his own label, Train Wreck.
</P>
<P>
	   He toured in 1998 and 1999, and wrote so many songs as he traveled that he
recorded some as "London Sessions Bootleg 1" and sold them at gigs. By the end
of the tour, he'd made three versions. Taylor says it was his most prolific
songwriting year and a half ever. He averaged almost a song a day.
</P>
<P>
	   When he first signed with King Records back in 1958 under his real name,
James Wesley Voight, promotion men found the name difficult. So he took the
nickname "Chip," which fellow golfers had given him before he quit the sport
with a wrist injury at 20. Somebody at King thought Taylor fit nicely with Chip.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor says he left music in 1980 after the boss in Nashville for Capitol
Records -- which had promised to promote him as a country artist -- told radio
stations to stop playing Taylor's current single, "One Night Out with the Boys,"
and play other Capitol singers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was supposed to make another album but that took everything out of me,"
Taylor says.
</P>
<P>
	   After that, he wrote songs only occasionally, including "Poppa Come Quick,"
which Bonnie Raitt recorded in 1988. In 1992, he did a three-week
singer-songwriter tour for New York's Bottom Line.
</P>
<P>
	   But Taylor made more money gambling than he had in music, although he didn't
save much of it. "It costs me money to do what I do now," he says. "I've signed
one other artist; I'd like my record label to be there to help some talented
people make it.	   "Now I'm hanging out with my heroes, Lucinda Williams, John
Prine, Steve Earle, Joe Ely, Guy Clark, instead of hibernating behind the Racing
Form all day long. Before, I didn't talk to anybody but Ernie. If somebody
phoned, I'd say, 'I'm doing fine. I can't talk to you now. I'll try and call you
later.' And I usually didn't.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now I'm absorbing more emotions of life and putting them into music. I
think my music has reached a new level. And I'm a better friend than I was."
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor calls Americana "a terrific area to be part of. I listen to John
Prine sing and realize he has got a magical thing where he transfers his heart
to his voice."
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor is the youngest of three notable brothers who grew up in Yonkers,
N.Y. Barry Voight is a geologist who invented a formula that predicts when
volcanoes will erupt; Jon Voight is a year younger and Chip is a year younger
than Jon.
</P>
<P>
	   Barry, he says, spent his boyhood outdoors, looking at rocks, birds and
animals. Jon entertained the family with comedic scenes. Chip listened to music
-- country, rockabilly and blues -- on the radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor also is writing a book. He has already written two about horse
racing: one for the professional gambler and one, anecdotal, for the amateur.
</P>
<P>
	   And, he says, "It's a good time for me. I wake up every morning so much
happier than I ever did."

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Fall for Art Films  </HEADLINE>
    By SEAN YOONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Standing in the lobby of Asia's largest
multiplex theater, Leong Miau Luan points excitedly at a poster for "Not One
Less," a critically acclaimed film from China.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've watched that one," says the teen-ager. "It was so refreshing compared
to all the big-budget blockbusters like 'Star Wars,' James Bond and 'Godzilla."'
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Leong would have been unable to see "Not One Less" -- which won
awards at film festivals in Venice and Sao Paulo, Brazil -- because most
theaters in Kuala Lumpur shun offbeat, hard-to-sell movies.
</P>
<P>
	   But now, movie aficionados in the Southeast Asian capital have begun
flocking to the city's newest multiplex, where shrewd marketing has turned art
films into an attraction for crowds fed up with Hollywood fare.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Malaysia's strict censorship laws still apply, the films have
included award-winners like Hong Kong's "Ordinary Heroes," Australia's "The
Castle" and Iran's "Children of Heaven." And there's more ahead, says Yvonne
Tan, the marketing officer who selects the films for Golden Screen Cinema,
Malaysia's leading multiplex operator.
</P>
<P>
	   Some observers were skeptical, predicting that such films would not appeal
to a generation of moviegoers brought up on sharks, alien attacks and Jackie
Chan.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was hard work promoting these films," admits Irving Chee, assistant
general manager of GSC. The company devised an extensive mailing list to reach
out to filmgoers and even roped in foreign embassies to generate word-of-mouth.
</P>
<P>
	   Chee got the idea of playing art films at the 18-screen multiplex in Kuala
Lumpur's Mid Valley Megamall, Asia's largest shopping mall, after speaking to
movie-goers, many of them working professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, his hunch is proving right. Positive buzz has helped the independent
foreign-language films achieve per-screen earnings that rival mainstream
crowd-pleasers such as "Toy Story 2" and "Stuart Little."
</P>
<P>
	   Within one month after the $6.6 million multiplex opened in December, some
100,000 tickets had been snapped up, a new national record.
</P>
<P>
	   Local critics are optimistic that art films aren't just a fad in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
	   "Art films are ready to take off in a big way," says Francis Dass, a movie
reviewer for the New Straits Times daily. "They won't break any major box-office
records, but people will definitely go for these smaller movies."
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the art films screened here include movies from the United States,
Canada, China, Japan and Vietnam. They play at four so-called International
Screens at the multiplex theater.
</P>
<P>
	   GSC's Tan said the films, such as "Next Stop Wonderland," a favorite at the
1998 Sundance Film Festival, will play for at least a month so that cinema buffs
won't feel pressured by time.
</P>
<P>
	   The selection of art movies, however, is likely to stay conservative because
of rigid censorship laws. Many European and Latin American films can't be
screened because censors are sure to hack away huge portions of celluloid for
even a hint of nudity. Even passionate kissing is near-taboo on Malaysian
screens.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the first victims at Mid Valley was Canada's "The Red Violin," which
had several nude scenes chopped out, leaving a jerky screenplay. The film swept
Quebec's prestigious Jutra awards last year, taking home trophies for best
picture and director.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not that we're so desperate to see any sex scenes," says copywriter
Teng Wai Poon. "We're mad because these cuts spoil the movie's flow and our
overall enjoyment."
</P>
<P>
	   GSC says they're helpless to stop the censors, who've banned many highly
lauded films such as "Saving Private Ryan" and "Schindler's List."

<HEADLINE> Author, Painter Found Call in Chapel  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PIERCE CITY, Mo. (AP) -- One Sunday in 1896, a young painter with a gift for
gab climbed onto his horse and rode 25 miles across a sunlit field to an
unassuming little white, wooden chapel in southwest Missouri.
</P>
<P>
	   There, in front of fewer than a dozen people, Harold Bell Wright found his
true calling.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never deliberately ... set out to be a preacher. I did not seek this job
with the Pierce City Church; the job found me," he later recalled in his
autobiography.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright's audience grew over the next century to millions of fans who
embraced the books he wrote -- novels like "Shepherd of the Hills" and "That
Printer of Udell's." His stories of ordinary people battling with questions of
faith and morality touched a nerve in readers, and he became the first American
author whose book sold more than a million copies.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright the author became a household name before he died in 1944, but few
remember Wright the preacher, says Carol Hirsch, the mayor of Pierce City. And
she wants to change that.
</P>
<P>
	   The rickety church where Wright first preached for $8 a week and battled
with his own questions of faith is being converted into a museum in honor of the
town's favorite pastor.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the best kept secret in Missouri, but there's no reason it should be a
secret," Hirsch said.
</P>
<P>
	   The old Church of the Disciples, built in 1879, was made into the Harold
Bell Wright Library in 1933 and housed several rare books donated by pioneer
families who attended the church. But the library outgrew those quarters and has
since moved out.
</P>
<P>
	   The one-room building still contains the organ and several of the original
pews used by the "dyed-in-the-wool, doctrine-hardened disciples" of Wright's
congregation. Hirsch plans to restore the building to its original look.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wright had a tremendous influence on this area, and our church had a
tremendous influence on him," she said. "It's only natural to want to share his
history here."
</P>
<P>
	   Wright was born in Rome, N.Y., in 1872, the second of four sons of William
and Alma Wright. His mother died when he was 11, leaving him to fend for himself
in the hands of an indifferent and alcoholic father.
</P>
<P>
	   The young man left home at age 12 and traveled extensively, staying in
shelters or with relatives when he could. His schooling was sporadic at best,
and he was mostly self-taught in his first vocation as a painter.
</P>
<P>
	   In the summer of 1896, Wright made his way to Missouri and scraped by
painting signs and hawking his rough landscape works in the village of Mount
Vernon. His gift for telling stories caught the attention of a group of church
elders from nearby Pierce City, who asked Wright to speak to their congregation.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was kind of reserved about this because he had no formal training in
preaching," said local historian Murray Bishoff, who is also managing editor of
the Monett Times. "But the youth of the church took a liking to him and
convinced him to stay."
</P>
<P>
	   In his book, "To My Sons," Wright reflected on his stay there.
</P>
<P>
	   "Pierce City was a sizable town, as towns in southern Missouri go. There
were several churches of as many denominations struggling for existence," he
wrote. "One good auditorium could have accommodated the entire churchgoing
population of the community."
</P>
<P>
	   Wright admitted he was critical of most churches and of the
"denominationalism" that encouraged separation between Christians. But the youth
at the Pierce City church touched his heart. Knowing the tiny congregation could
not afford a real pastor, he exchanged his paintbrush for a Bible.
</P>
<P>
	   "I could not believe that any work I might in the time accomplish as an
artist could compare in value with the influence I could exert by direct contact
with these young people," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright worried about his "general unfitness" for preaching, and was
constantly aware that church elders accepted him with reservations. But he
preached what he knew, stories about real people with real problems that his
congregation could understand, Bishoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   He was an unconventional minister who wore no distinctive garb, abhorred
being called "Reverend," and criticized other ministers who took advantage of
their clergy credentials by accepting favors and discounts.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were wise old denominational elders who listened to my particular
brand of preaching with somewhat pained expressions," Wright wrote. "It was not
so much the things that I said in my preaching that troubled them; it was rather
the things I did not say. I placed the emphasis upon the wrong words. ... On the
whole, I must have been something of an irregular and presumptuous thorn in the
flesh of the body ministerial."
</P>
<P>
	   Near the end of his second year at Pierce City, Wright was invited to pastor
at a church in Pittsburgh, Kan., a coal-mining town of about 15,000. There he
wrote his first novel, "That Printer of Udell's."
</P>
<P>
	   The book, published in 1902, was actually a compilation of several sermons
he delivered to his congregation in Pittsburgh. Several of his sermons had also
been printed in "Christian Century," a popular religious publication at the
time.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright had also become an accomplished and well-respected artist. He even
painted murals in some churches in the Midwest. At one point, he faced a
personal dilemma as to whether he should pursue his artistic abilities on canvas
or through literary means.
</P>
<P>
	   It was in August 1909, the same month in which "The Calling of Dan Matthews"
was published, that, according to a newspaper article, Wright went to his studio
and tore down every picture he had painted and every canvas he had sketched. He
carried them all outside and threw them into one big heap.
</P>
<P>
	   "Then without hesitating -- lest he should relent, he touched a match to the
heap and $500 worth of materials went up in smoke," the article said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was truly a burnt offering to the art of writing, and thus began Wright's
full-time career as a novelist. (Several of his paintings escaped the blaze, and
one of his popular landscape paintings hangs today in a tower dedicated to
Wright in Branson, Mo.)
</P>
<P>
	   From that point on, his influence as a writer was unmistakable. In 1927,
Vanity Fair ranked him among the top six "Voices of America," and later, Ronald
Reagan said Wright's books had persuaded him to declare his faith and be
baptized in the Christian Church.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright's description of the Ozarks and its friendly inhabitants in "Shepherd
of the Hills" is credited for the area's first tourist boom, in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
	   Bishoff insists that Wright's experiences as a minister in Pierce City and
elsewhere are no doubt reflected in his work and success as a novelist.
</P>
<P>
	   "He wrote about people struggling with morality and theology, and that's
where the muscle comes in, that's what makes his books stand up," Bishoff said.
"The spiritual battle between right and wrong and where do I go from here --
people needed to read about this."

<HEADLINE> Grammys Reveal New Generation Gap  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Barring an upset of major proportions, rock veteran Carlos
Santana will walk to the podium at next Wednesday's Grammy Awards to accept an
armload of trophies for his best-selling comeback album, "Supernatural."
</P>
<P>
	   He will look out at several fresh-faced Grammy nominees -- the Backstreet
Boys, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera -- who have no memory of when Santana's
scorching guitar work on songs like "Oye Como Va" and "Black Magic Woman" was
fresh.
</P>
<P>
	   None of them had been born at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   The Baby Boomers who once vowed never to trust anyone over 30 are now part
of another generation gap -- this time with their children. That musical schism
will be exposed on the Grammys the way it never has before.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-hour ceremony at Los Angeles' new Staples Center, with Rosie
O'Donnell as host, will start at 8 p.m. EST on CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Jamieson remembers taking Santana's first record to a party three
decades ago. He played the music over and over through the night. Santana's
musical resurrection brings back nothing but good memories.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's what makes this business exciting," he said, "that a
fiftysomething-year-old can be making a great, vital statement that touches so
many people right along with an 18-year-old."
</P>
<P>
	   Now president of the RCA record company, Jamieson is rooting for someone a
lot younger on Wednesday night. RCA's 19-year-old singer Aguilera is a Grammy
nominee for best new artist.
</P>
<P>
	   Just try to imagine Aguilera and her young rival, Spears, watching Santana
from the audience. For them, it must be like their dad being up for an award.
Or, in the case of nominee Cher, their mom. They'll be polite, they'll respect
their elders, but they know what's cool.
</P>
<P>
	   THEY'RE cool.
</P>
<P>
	   They're the heroes of a new generation of music buyers, the ones who come
home from school and check out Carson Daly on MTV's "Total Request Live," and
whose emergence was the most important story of the past year in music.
</P>
<P>
	   Teen pop accounted for three of the four best-selling albums in 1999, by the
Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync and Spears. Shania Twain was the exception. Four other
albums in the top 10 -- by Ricky Martin, the Offspring, Limp Bizkit and TLC --
were hits because they appealed to the same audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Carlos Santana can attribute much of his new success with
"Supernatural" to a willingness to work with younger artists on the album,
including singer Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20 on the hit single, "Smooth."
</P>
<P>
	   Baby boomers have been baffled by new music before, when Generation X
embraced grunge and it seemed like so much noise to their older brothers.
</P>
<P>
	   This is different. These are their kids.
</P>
<P>
	   The young musicians have to overcome a deep-seated suspicion that none of
them are built to last like Bob Dylan or the Beatles. The feeling is that the
new stars are known more for their dance steps and photogenic looks than an
ability to write songs or play instruments.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Calderone thinks that's unfair. The senior vice president of music
programming at MTV said that whenever a new crop of artists becomes popular,
there's an older group to claim they are shallow.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anytime there's an evolution in music, no matter what genre it goes into,
you are always going to find people who are not open to change," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   You might expect Calderone to say that; young viewers have sent MTV's
ratings soaring. Less expected is the attitude of his counterpart at VH1 -- the
music station for post-teens -- where the Backstreet Boys, Aguilera and Spears
have made the video playlist.
</P>
<P>
	   Back-to-back albums that each sold more than 10 million copies have put the
Backstreet Boys on stronger footing than many teen acts in the past, said Wayne
Isaak, VH1's executive vice president of music.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know what? Their songs are good," Isaak said. "The songwriting is good,
the production is well done. These songs could be hits for other people."
</P>
<P>
	   Certainly the Backstreet Boys' album sales indicate it's not just teen-agers
buying.
</P>
<P>
	   The downside of the teen-dominated marketplace is the ruthless rule of hit
songs. The way the music business is set up now, without a top 40 hit it's
difficult for any music to be heard, and hard for people who don't make hits to
sustain a career.
</P>
<P>
	   Music fans over 40, in particular, have to really pay attention to know
what's going on.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's gotten to the point where everybody knows about the top five artists
who are big, and nobody knows about anybody else existing very much," said rock
singer Matthew Sweet.
</P>
<P>
	   Sweet made the best-reviewed album of his career last fall, "In Reverse."
But since it is a form of melodic rock 'n' roll that's not particularly
fashionable right now, he's struggling to get it heard beyond a small audience
of critics.
</P>
<P>
	   Isaak is encouraged, though, by what he sees as a greater degree of musical
open-mindedness in the last several years.
</P>
<P>
	   You can see it every day on "Total Request Live." Teen pop mingles with the
rap of Jay-Z and Dr. Dre, or the metallic rap of Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock, or
the punk rock of Blink 182. Kids listen to it all.
</P>
<P>
	   And while their parents, when they were teen-agers, might have been
horrified to listen to the music of their own parents, that's not necessarily
the case today.
</P>
<P>
	   Just like in the 1960s, it's the Baby Boomers who feel the gap's effect more
than the generation on the other side.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've heard that the way the music rules apply, only 17 to 27 years old is
cool. Well, surprise," Carlos Santana said on the day he received his Grammy
nominations. "You know, there's a reason why teen-agers listen to '60s music,
the Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, Santana: They need to pass through us to
get to their thing."

<HEADLINE> RCA Becomes Record Company Prototype  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rather than talk about his latest potential star, RCA
executive vice president Jack Rovner walks around his desk to a CD player,
inserts a disc and cranks up the volume.
</P>
<P>
	   The singing and rapping of Bronx-bred Tarsha Vega booms through the room.
Her insanely catchy pop song, "Prom Night," updates a memorable chorus written
by Rick Nelson 30 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you can't please everyone," she sings, "you've got to be yourself."
</P>
<P>
	   Rovner believes Vega's music will infiltrate the brains of thousands of
teen-age girls this summer, and many of their mothers, too. If those instincts
are right -- and his track record makes it hard to bet against him -- Tarsha
Vega will follow label-mate Christina Aguilera to the top of the charts.
</P>
<P>
	   Few companies have mastered the changes in the music industry quite like RCA
in the past five years, or been as susceptible to its pitfalls. It is a
prototype for the record business, circa 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Teen pop stars, the kind who make fans squeal on MTV's "Total Request Live,"
rule the charts these days. RCA anticipated the trend, making a fortune with 'N
Sync, Aguilera and Tyrese.
</P>
<P>
	   Recognizing the public's short attention span for entertainment, RCA is also
adept at developing new artists, like the rock band Lit and ingenue Natalie
Imbruglia. It churns out fun, disposable and lucrative radio hits like
"Macarena" and Lou Bega's "Mambo No. 5."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet with the industry worried that none of today's hit-makers will be
remembered in 10 years, most of RCA's successes haven't proved their staying
power.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the least of Rovner's worries when he and RCA President Bob
Jamieson took over in 1995. RCA was so cold its nickname in the industry was
"Recording Cemetery of America." Its biggest star was Elvis Presley. When your
most bankable artist has been dead 20 years, that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   They remade the label, changing about 90 percent of its artist roster and
most of the personnel. Among the few artists to survive were the Dave Matthews
Band, ZZ Top and Bruce Hornsby.
</P>
<P>
	   RCA rebuilt, for the most part, with youthful top 40 hit-makers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We saw where the market was going," Rovner said. "Young kids were being
brought into music at a much younger age. They're so aware of what's going on.
One group was not enough for them. They had to have hit songs and the groups had
to be enormously talented."
</P>
<P>
	   Swedish pop star Robyn was an early success. So was 'N Sync, although the
boy band recently left RCA after a contract dispute. Two quick hits put Aguilera
in competition with fellow teen queen Britney Spears for this year's best new
artist Grammy Award. The prizes, televised on CBS at 8 p.m. EST Wednesday, will
be handed out at a three-hour ceremony at Los Angeles' new Staples Center, with
Rosie O'Donnell as host.
</P>
<P>
	   RCA ranked fourth among record labels in 1999, with 29 albums or singles on
Billboard's charts; it wasn't ranked in the top 15 labels in 1995. Market share
has generally tripled during that period.
</P>
<P>
	   Owned by Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment, RCA doesn't release revenue
figures.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's strategy is to release relatively few albums, compared with
most major labels, and work them relentlessly. It tries to create a buzz for its
acts for months before the music goes on sale, then keeps promoting them even if
the public doesn't immediately respond.
</P>
<P>
	   "The momentum they've got going is really strong right now," said Tom
Calderone, MTV's senior vice president of music and talent.
</P>
<P>
	   In today's music business, if you don't have a hit, you're virtually
invisible. For RCA, no one illustrates the flip side of success better than the
Verve Pipe.
</P>
<P>
	   The rock band was one of RCA's most satisfying stories just three years ago.
Its debut album had been out almost a year before the single, "The Freshmen,"
became a hit. The album, "Urban Hymns," went on to sell 1.1 million copies.
</P>
<P>
	   But without such a catchy song on the band's second album, released last
summer, radio ignored it. So did the public. So far, it's sold a paltry 55,000
copies, according to Soundscan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Verve Pipe are suddenly in danger of joining the very crowded club of
one-hit wonders.
</P>
<P>
	   At one time, music fans routinely followed an artist's career, looking
forward to new albums and giving the musicians a chance to grow. Record
companies took the time to nurture, too. But that's happening less frequently
these days.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're in this disposable mentality that once you've received the benefit of
an entertainment product, you want to move on to something else," Rovner said.
</P>
<P>
	   For every success story like Santana, there are seemingly dozens of
well-known musicians who released albums last year to utter public indifference
-- Sting, the former Prince and Melissa Etheridge are examples. Promising young
stars like Tori Amos, Paula Cole and Alanis Morissette have seen huge sales
drop-offs.
</P>
<P>
	   "We eat our young," Jamieson said, blaming the industry's hunger for quick
profits. Record company shareholders demand hits, and aren't willing to wait for
an artist who can't produce them right away, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The current trend toward record company consolidation -- as seen by last
month's merger between Warner Music and EMI -- increases the pressure and likely
means fewer opportunities for artists.
</P>
<P>
	   RCA faces the same problem of quick burnouts as everyone else in the
industry, said Wayne Isaak, executive vice president of music at VH1.
</P>
<P>
	   "Having the artists is an ongoing search," said Isaak, a former A&AMP;M Records
executive. "If they continue to work the way they've been working and continue
to invest in the ... process, they have the ability to keep going."
</P>
<P>
	   RCA has carefully plotted Aguilera's introduction with an eye toward
longevity. Her first single, "Genie in a Bottle," was chosen to be most
attractive to a teen-age audience. The followup was "What a Girl Wants," a
progression that makes her seem like a girl growing up.
</P>
<P>
	   The third single, "I Turn to You," is a ballad that will be pushed on adult
contemporary stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The pitch is subtle, but Aguilera is being presented as an artist with a
better voice than Spears, her teen-dream competition. Aguilera will attempt to
further broaden her appeal in the next year by releasing a disc with
Spanish-language versions of her music and an album of Christmas songs.
</P>
<P>
	   Will it work? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't always know when you're developing an artist if you're developing
one that has the ability and the instincts and the drive to be an artist for the
long term," Jamieson said.
</P>
<P>
	   RCA's model for career development is the Dave Matthews Band, whose signing
predates Jamieson. Through relentless touring and a sterling live reputation,
the band has become one of rock's top acts.
</P>
<P>
	   Matthews is building a catalog of music, which is why long-term artist
development is so important. In a decade, Dave Matthews Band will likely have
fans searching for copies of his early music, or for greatest hits sets.
</P>
<P>
	   No one expects that from the man behind "Mambo No. 5." Record executives
risk their reputations for quality work by releasing novelty songs, and risk
their financial health if they turn up their noses at them.
</P>
<P>
	   That's why RCA made Lou Bega a household name, even if only briefly.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't want to miss an opportunity, and that's what it was," Jamieson
said. "We try to keep our eyes open for the longer term and also for the short
term."
</P>
<P>
	   RCA faces some big tests of its development abilities soon. Imbruglia, whose
sad-eyed video turned "Torn" into a big hit in 1998, is working on a second
album. So is Robyn, who first appeared as the teen phenomenon was beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, RCA keeps looking for something new. Tarsha Vega made a skillful
videotape and launched a bidding war among labels to sign her. RCA won, and
believes its ability to break new artists was the key factor.
</P>
<P>
	   Her album is due out in June. The star-making prep work, the photo sessions,
have already begun.
</P>
<P>
	   Rovner cues another song on his office CD player. And he smiles a hopeful
smile.

<HEADLINE> Jane Russell: Faith Helped Her Cope  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    Another in an occasional series by AP's veteran Hollywood correspondent
profiling the personalities who have helped define movie stardom over the years.
By BOB THOMAS Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- A glowering Jane Russell leans against a
haystack, bodice at the breaking point. A leggy Betty Grable in bathing suit and
heels tosses an enticing glance backward. Rita Hayworth in a form-fitting
negligee kneels seductively on a silken bed.
</P>
<P>
	   Few GIs in World War II were ever very far from one of these photos. All
three images -- enduring to this day -- exuded a glorious, youthful sexuality
that enthralled lonely soldiers from Fort Dix to Dunkirk.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the pinup queens had well established movie careers. Yet one was a
movie star who had scarcely been seen in a movie.
</P>
<P>
	   Jane Russell was the product of pure publicity, supervised by her mentor,
Howard Hughes, and centered on her sulking beauty, glowing sensuality and, oh
yes, the ample bosom.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't as if Russell didn't try to make a movie along the way. In 1941,
Hughes cast her as the temptress in his "sex Western," "The Outlaw."
</P>
<P>
	   But fights with the film industry's censors over Russell's cleavage kept the
film from general release until 1950. No matter -- Russell's celebrity continued
to build, boosted by a thousand quips from radio comedians.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Hope once introduced her as "the two and only Jane Russell." After
Hughes assumed control of RKO, the eccentric industrialist cast her with Frank
Sinatra and Groucho Marx in a lame 1951 comedy titled "Double Dynamite."
</P>
<P>
	   Jane Russell hasn't made a movie in 30 years, yet she remains a symbol of
the awakening sexuality of mid-century America.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite her on-screen persona, Russell's private life lacked the sensation
and scandal of other Hollywood sex goddesses, such as Marilyn Monroe, Lana
Turner and Hayworth.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, at the height of her career, Russell started the Hollywood
Christian Group, a gathering of industry people who met for Bible study and
inspiration. In 1955, she also founded the World Adoption International Fund,
which pioneered the adoption of children from foreign countries by American
families.
</P>
<P>
	   Through most of her film career, Russell was married to her high school
sweetheart, Bob Waterfield, ace quarterback for UCLA and the Los Angeles Rams.
They adopted three children and divorced after 23 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   Her second marriage, in 1969 to actor Roger Barrett, ended after three
months when he died suddenly. In 1972, she married real estate broker and
builder John Peoples; he died in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Jane Russell lives alone now -- in a wooded glade a few miles south of Santa
Barbara and a short drive inland from the Pacific Ocean. The sprawling
ranch-style house sits on two acres sheltered by oaks and sycamores, and a river
runs through it -- at least during the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
	   The house is filled with Russell's color-splashed paintings, but little
evidence of her movie past. The exception is a hallway filled with photos of her
with Robert Mitchum, Clark Gable, Hope, Monroe and other costars.
</P>
<P>
	   "An Italian journalist brought them to me, and my husband insisted on
hanging them up against my wishes," she said, apologetically. "I went to a
star's house once and there were pictures of her in every room. I hate that."
</P>
<P>
	   She did allow a gallery of her former life in the cozy pool house -- news
clippings, photographs, even a replica of the famous Norman Rockwell painting of
a young girl, obviously movie-struck, looking in a mirror with a portrait of
Jane Russell on her lap.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell is putting the house up for sale at slightly under $2 million.
Except for her desire to do some designing -- "I love to design, whether it's
clothes or houses or anything" -- she has no plans for the future. She
explained:
</P>
<P>
	   "The Lord said to me long ago, through my mom, 'Down the hall are all these
doors. You knock on the doors, and the door that is open, you go in. The door
that closes, you're not to go in.'
</P>
<P>
	   "That's what I'm doing. I'm just wandering down the hall and knocking on the
doors. If he wants me in that one, it'll be fine. If he doesn't want me in that
one, it'll be closed."
</P>
<P>
	   At 78, she still exudes the star quality that attracted Howard Hughes' eye.
The hair is almost gray, befitting a great-grandmother. Yet that Russell look,
somewhere between a pout and a smolder, remains.
</P>
<P>
	   She was born Ernestine Jane Geraldine Russell in Bemidji, Minn., on June 21,
1921. The family moved to the warmer clime of the San Fernando Valley, where she
fell in love with football hero Waterfield at Van Nuys High School. They married
in 1941.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Russell's early ambition was to be a designer of some sort, that
all changed when an agent spotted her as a receptionist in a chiropodist's
office. Howard Hughes was seeking a pair of unknowns to star in "The Outlaw,"
and she was one of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't meet Howard until way after I was under contract," she recalled.
"Howard Hawks was the director, and he was doing tests with a half-dozen other
girls and guys, who were all dressed up like cowboys. They'd been doing this for
some time, and this was near the end."
</P>
<P>
	   Hawks took a pair at a time and had them perform the haystack scene. Later,
Hawks told Russell and another unknown, Jack Beutel, that they had the parts.
Both in shock, the pair left Hawks' office, and Beutel noticed a tall,
mysterious-looking man staring at them in the hallway. He guessed it was Hughes.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell, laughing at the memory, said, "I waved to him, and he nodded his
head and went into Hawks' office. I didn't meet him until three months after
that."
</P>
<P>
	   The on-screen shootouts of "The Outlaw" were matched by the battles between
Hughes and Hawks. Hughes issued so many critiques of each day's work that Hawks
finally said, "Look, Howard, why don't you direct this picture?" Hughes did.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hughes directed the whole picture -- for nine bloody months!" Russell
remarked. "Walter Huston was pleased, because he was being paid by the week.
Tommy Mitchell was out of his mind, he was so mad. Finally he flipped his wig,
threw his hat down and stomped.
</P>
<P>
	   "Howard just sat back in his chair while Mitchell was screaming and yelling.
Finally Howard said, 'Tommy, did you say something?'
</P>
<P>
	   "Howard Hughes was never angry, never cross or bitter. He was a very sweet
man."
</P>
<P>
	   "The Outlaw" was briefly shown in 1941 and 1943, drawing publicity from
Hughes' defiance of the industry's censorship. The film was finally released
nationwide in 1950 to reviewers' yawns.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the years Russell signed three contracts with Hughes, starting at $50 a
week and ending with an unprecedented deal that paid her $1,000 a week for 20
years.
</P>
<P>
	   At RKO, the eccentric industrialist took special care of his most important
star, even fashioning a brassiere for her famous bosom (she says she never wore
it). But he was ill-equipped for the role of studio boss, and Russell's films,
though ballyhooed and usually profitable, were mostly potboilers.
</P>
<P>
	   Her only box-office hits happened when she was loaned out to other studios:
"Paleface" with Hope, "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" with Monroe.
</P>
<P>
	   "Marilyn was very sweet," Russell recalled. "She was also very nervous.
After a scene she would turn around and look at her drama coach, not at Howard
Hawks, the director. You don't do that to Howard Hawks. The coach was sent off
the set immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   "After work, she would go study with the coach all evening long. I went
home, like a person.
</P>
<P>
	   "She wanted to be the best, to learn everything she could possibly learn.
She would come to the studio at 6 in the morning; I came at 7:30, did my own
makeup, had my hair done and was on the set at 9. Her makeup man told my makeup
man she was ready at 9, but she was too nervous to come on the set.
</P>
<P>
	   "So I started walking by her dressing room and saying, 'Come on, Marilyn,
let's go; we've got about 15 minutes, honey.' She'd say (breathlessly), 'Oh,
OK,' and she'd get up. I think if anybody had done that later, she never would
have been late. But they didn't do that. They just sat there and sulked, got
mad."
</P>
<P>
	   Russell made only four movies in the 1960s, often in secondary roles. Her
film career ended with "Darker Than Amber" in 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why did I quit?" she asked. "Because I was getting too old! You couldn't go
on acting in those years if you were an actress over 30, honey.
</P>
<P>
	   "So I did nightclubs and TV stuff and I did plays; I did 'Company' in New
York for six months -- that was scary. On my opening night it wasn't a normal
audience; it was all the other actors in New York. There you are, trying out.
But I got through it."
</P>
<P>
	   As she wrote in her 1985 autobiography, "My Path and Detours," Russell's
life has not always been easy. Before her marriage to Waterfield, she had a
back-alley abortion, which she says may have resulted in her inability to bear
children.
</P>
<P>
	   But she sees that as part of a divine plan. Her efforts to adopt children
showed her the difficulty Americans faced with adoptions, which led her to found
WAIF. Over the years, she says, it has led to 51,000 adoptions, mostly from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   The marriage to Waterfield eventually unraveled, and she lost her next two
husbands to heart attacks. She also struggled with alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
	   Through it all, her faith has prevailed. It was instilled by her mother, who
rallied her five children to build a home chapel where she could preach the
Bible to family and friends.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell has followed her mother's example. Lately she has been conducting a
Bible class for Catholic children. "They had never read the Bible, so we started
at the beginning and read through Revelations," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Without faith, I never would have made it," she reflected. "I don't know
how people can survive all the disasters in their lives if they don't have any
faith, if they don't know the Lord loves them and cares about them and he has
another plan."
</P>
<P>
	   Her face brightened.
</P>
<P>
	   "And he has another plan now. I don't know what it is. I'll let you know
later."

<HEADLINE> Kerrey To Lead New School University  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEDLAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Sen. Bob Kerrey, who announced last month that he would
not seek a third term, said Wednesday that he will take a job offer as president
of New School University in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've had a longstanding passion and love of education and an interest in
doing more,'' Kerrey said. ``This is what I would like to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kerrey said he would start working for the university next January, after he
officially has left office. He said he will not sign a contract or address the
details of his new position until that time. The school, founded in 1919 and
originally known as the New School of Social Research, has 7,000 degree students
and 20,000 continuing education students.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerrey, who taught a college course in California in the 1980s, said he
would like to teach a course at the university on making laws. In addition,
Kerrey said, he would like to expand adult education programs and the
university's use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope to solve more problems than I can create,'' Kerrey said in a
telephone interview from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerrey, who operates a chain of restaurants and health clubs in Nebraska,
said he plans to remain a presence in his home state even though he will be
moving to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I had been offered the presidency to the University of Nebraska, I may
be talking now of moving to Lincoln,'' Kerrey said. ``My businesses will keep me
involved in Nebraska. I will be a grateful taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kerrey said ``it's certainly a nice coincidence'' that New York is the home
of his longtime girlfriend, Sara Paley, a former writer for ``Saturday Night
Live.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kerry's decision not to run had been a setback for Democratic hopes of
making gains in the Senate. The Senate has a 55-45 Republican majority, and
Kerrey's seat was considered a safe one in a state that traditionally votes
Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Senate, Kerrey established himself as an expert on agriculture, an
advocate for major health care reforms and a liberal voice on defense matters,
including voting against going to war in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerrey, millionaire, Vietnam war hero and former governor, won election in
the Senate in 1988 by defeating appointed incumbent Sen. David Karnes. In 1992,
he withdrew a presidential bid after failing to win much support in any primary
except South Dakota. He won a second Senate term in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Limits Breast Cancer Coverage  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna, the nation's largest health insurer, has dropped
coverage of bone marrow transplants for breast cancer patients after a pivotal
study on the treatment was recently discredited.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna said today it will only pay for the therapy for women participating in
federally sponsored studies.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision comes just two weeks after it was disclosed that a South
African study of the treatment-- which had given hope to some women with
advanced breast cancer -- contained falsified data.
</P>
<P>
	   The South African study was the only one of five long-awaited studies that
initially found the treatment helped prolong survival rates. The four other
studies released in April 1999 found no difference in survival for breast cancer
patients who underwent the arduous bone marrow transplant therapy than those who
tried less risky treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   "At this point in time there is no credible evidence that this approach is
likely to be better than a more conventional approach," said Dr. Arthur
Leibowitz, chief medical officer for Aetna U.S. Healthcare. "We now have five
well controlled studies that show this thing doesn't work."
</P>
<P>
	   The findings prompted top cancer specialists to conclude that, at least for
women with advanced breast cancer, a bone marrow transplant was not a good
option.
</P>
<P>
	   Patient advocacy groups such as the National Breast Cancer Coalition have
also advised that women who aren't participating in medical research testing
should not try bone transplant therapy.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Aetna is doing the right thing," said Fran Visco, president of
coalition. "Bone marrow transplant is not quality health care for women with
breast cancer."
</P>
<P>
	   In the controversial treatment, women receive ultrahigh doses of
chemotherapy followed by a bone marrow transplant. Thousands of women have
demanded the procedure, believing it is their last best hope.
</P>
<P>
	   Bone marrow transplants usually cost at least $100,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Insurers initially balked at covering the treatment in the late 1980s, but
eventually most paid for it after pressed by lawsuits and fears about a public
relations backlash.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna said it will continue to pay for bone marrow transplants for illnesses
such as leukemia, in which studies have proven its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Aetna paid for 336 bone marrow transplants, about half of them
for breast cancer patients, a spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 45.38; Nasdaq Up 16.07  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as a pair of strong corporate
profit reports helped technology stocks edge back from a recent slump but blue
chips fell.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
45.38 at 10,672.71.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 6.21 at 1,395.84, and the high-tech dominated Nasdaq composite index was up
16.07 at 4,436.84.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Applied Materials rose 6 7/16 to 172 15/16 after announcing
stronger-than-expected profits and a robust outlook for the coming year. The
company, a leading maker of chip-manufacturing equipment, earned $328.5 million,
or 80 cents per share, in its most recent quarter. Analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 77 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Applied Materials also announced it will split its stock two shares for one
effective March 15.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader semiconductor sector rose on Applied Materials' report of strong
customer demand. LSI Logic rose 4 7/8 to 103 1/8 and Texas Instuments rose 3 1/4
to 138 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Lycos, maker of a popular Internet search engine, rose 4 3/4 to 73 13/16.
The company said late Tuesday it earned 3 cents per share in its fiscal second
quarter, beating analysts' estimates of 1 cent per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, investors' favorites for the past several months, have
struggled in the past three sessions as traders sold shares to collect profits.
Today, they edged back at the expense of blue-chips like Coca-Cola, down 1 5/8
at 54 1/16, and Procter &AMP; Gamble, down 1 3/4 at 94.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors remained on edge over concerns that the rapid growth of the
U.S. economy will persuade the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest
rates to raise the cost of borrowing money and force a slowdown. The Fed, which
has raised rates four times since last June, fears the booming economy will
eventually spark a rise in inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The U.S. economy doesn't seem to be slowing down at all," said Alan
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. "Stocks
continue to climb a wall of worry over higher interest rates."
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest-rate
fluctuations, were mostly lower today. American Express fell 4 11/16 to 154
7/16.
</P>
<P>
	   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancers by a
5-to-4 margin. NYSE volume came to 453.60 million shares, slightly behind
Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.33 to 546.57.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Imposes Sanctions on Sudan  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury Department today imposed economic sanctions
against Sudan's state-owned oil enterprise and a joint venture of Sudan and
three foreign oil companies. A new government commission on religious freedom is
appealing for broader sanctions to prevent rights abusers from raising money on
U.S. stock markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury announced that U.S. citizens or companies can no longer engage in
trade or conduct financial transactions with Sudan's Sudapet Ltd. or with
Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company Ltd. under a 1997 order that imposes
sanctions on Sudan as a sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   Greater Nile is a joint venture of Sudan, China's national oil company,
Malaysia's state-owned Petronas and Canada's Talisman Energy Corp. No sanctions
are designated against those entities.
</P>
<P>
	   Sudan's government and 125 Sudanese entities now fall under the sanctions,
which call for criminal penalties of up to $500,000 for each violation for
corporations and $250,000 fines for individuals with up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom wants the sanctions
also to apply to efforts by any company to raise money on U.S. stock markets
that would benefit Sudan. The Treasury Department says sanctions against Sudan,
imposed under a 1997 presidential order, do not apply to capital markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission plans to watch new stock offerings from foreign government
corporations involved with Sudan and use its power of persuasion with the
markets -- the only power it has.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine-member commission focused in its first public hearing Tuesday on
abuses against Christians in Sudan, which the United States considers an
exporter of terrorism, and on a Chinese government-owned oil company's projects
in that East African country.
</P>
<P>
	   At Tuesday's hearing, an exiled Sudanese Catholic bishop alleged that a
Sudanese military plane intentionally bombed a school in his district last
Tuesday and killed 14 children. Bishop Macram Max Gassis accused the government
of trying to kill off the country's Roman Catholic minority. ``If you destroy
the fruit, you will have no more trees tomorrow,'' Gassis said.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton described the bombing an outrage and said in a statement
that such events have become commonplace in Sudan's 17-year civil war, which has
claimed 2 million lives.
</P>
<P>
	   The official Sudan News Agency quoted the foreign minister, Mustafa Osman
Ismail, as saying if government bombs did kill children, it was an accident of
war, because rebel fighters had amassed near the elementary school.
</P>
<P>
	   The religious freedom commission, which is to take up abuses of religion in
Russia and China later in the year, has appealed to Clinton to prohibit the
Chinese state oil company and others from using U.S. capital markets to finance
projects in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department insists that existing sanctions against Sudan cannot
apply to capital markets. Sudan is under U.S. sanctions both for allegedly
exporting terrorism and abuse of its Christian minority.
</P>
<P>
	   In view of Treasury's position, Commission members have said they plan to
meet with experts and market managers to explore ``voluntary adoption of human
rights and religious-freedom criteria'' for entry into U.S. stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the commission has appointed a task force to monitor plans by
China National Oil Co. to raise money through a listing on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   PetroChina, owned by the company, is expected to proceed with an initial
public offering in excess of $5 billion in the next several weeks, said Roger
Robinson Jr., a former National Security Council director, now chairman of the
William J. Casey Institute of the Center for Security Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese investment in the 940-mile pipeline from Heglid in southern Sudan to
Port Sudan on the Red Sea, completed in September, is part of the state oil
company's largest overseas venture. The Chinese oil company also helped build a
refinery in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson said the commission needs to evaluate whether the Chinese IPO can
ensure that money raised in U.S. markets are not diverted to the oil company's
project in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   The religious freedom commission was set up to advise the State Department
and the White House on protection of religious freedom around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Organized under a 1998 law that arose partly out of rising congressional
unease about alleged persecution of Christians abroad, it is headed by Rabbi
David Saperstein and George Washington University Law School Dean Michael K.
Young and includes people of Christian, Muslim and Baha'i faiths.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the law that created the panel, the State Department has designated
China, Iran, Iraq, Burma and Sudan as ``countries of particular concern'' for
religious freedom. That designation subjects them to diplomatic and economic
sanctions. The department also lists Serbia and the Taliban movement that rules
most of Afghanistan as ``particularly severe violators of religious freedom.''

<HEADLINE> Boss Gives Jolt to '48 Hours'  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- When you watch "48 Hours," you're tuned to a couple of CBS
News institutions. And that's not even counting Dan Rather, its anchor.
</P>
<P>
	   First, there's the newsmagazine itself. Having notched its dozenth birthday
last month, "48 Hours" prospers as the fourth-oldest series in prime time --
behind only "60 Minutes," "Monday Night Football" and "20/20."
</P>
<P>
	   Quietly yet defiantly, "48 Hours" (which airs Thursday at 10 p.m. EST) has
stood its ground and kept stories coming as TV's only single-subject magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   But four summers ago, another CBS News institution took it over as executive
producer. The new boss gave "48 Hours" a necessary jolt.
</P>
<P>
	   At 47, Susan Zirinsky seems a bit young to qualify as venerable, but she's
been a presence at CBS News for nearly 28 years. "I got hired a week after the
Watergate break-in as a desk assistant in Washington on weekends," she recalls.
</P>
<P>
	   In a variety of subsequent, somewhat loftier positions at "The CBS Evening
News" and the newsmagazine "Eye to Eye," not to mention stints running the
network's election coverage, Zirinsky would gain a wealth of experience.
</P>
<P>
	   And in the mid-1980s, she would also claim a place in pop-culture history
thanks to the James L. Brooks film "Broadcast News." Hired as a technical
consultant for this shrewd comedy about her chosen profession, Zirinsky supplied
appropriate journalese, prepared the fictional network's "news reports" -- and
served as inspiration for the Holly Hunter character, a driven young producer
who is the film's kinetic centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
	   The likeness is unmistakable. Zirinsky, too, is petite, engaging and
high-rev.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm a Type A personality," she readily admits. "I'm like that 'Peanuts'
character who has the dust cloud around him." Not, of course, because she
doesn't bathe: "I'm generating dust because I'm moving so fast."
</P>
<P>
	   And in any needed direction. "I'm never cocky -- as a matter of fact, I'm
unbearably insecure -- but I really do know that I can do anything at CBS," she
says. "I could get a (video) feed in from Beijing or fix the copier machine."
</P>
<P>
	   No wonder that in July 1996 she was asked to fix "48 Hours."
</P>
<P>
	   For several months, the program had been trying out a multisubject format
that dealt with two or even three stories during the hour. Not only wasn't this
working, but it betrayed the show's original mandate: spend 48 hours with a
story-in-progress, then let it unfold for an entire broadcast.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had to go back to move forward," notes Zirinsky, who quickly restored
the old game plan. And that's the way the game is played today by Rather and
correspondents Harold Dow, Bill Lagattuta, Erin Moriarty, Troy Roberts, Susan
Spencer and Peter Van Sant.
</P>
<P>
	   But along the way, Zirinsky has enlarged on the original idea. "You can't do
a simple linear 'take me and show me' kind of program anymore," she says. "The
audience demands more."
</P>
<P>
	   For example, quick response. When events warrant, the "48 Hours" team stands
ready to turn out a broadcast in even fewer than 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   "If something happens at 4 o'clock today," Zirinsky is saying shortly after
noon, "I know we can put on a prime-time instant special tonight, and it'll be
very good."
</P>
<P>
	   But other "48 Hours" editions are cultivated for as much as a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The recently aired "Who Killed Mr. Adair?" was a tidy masterpiece about the
warring parties to an extramarital affair that resulted in murder. "48 Hours"
began tracking that story in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The series has tapped narratives from topics such as polygamy, adoption gone
wrong, weight-loss schemes, Internet courtship and a world-class impostor. This
Thursday, "Daddy's Little Girl" follows the murder trial of a young woman who
claims she killed her father in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   "48 Hours" has been a Thursday-at-10 fixture since 1995, when it was thrown
against ABC's "PrimeTime Live" (the first time two newsmagazines had butted
heads) and, over on NBC, against ratings heavyweight "ER."
</P>
<P>
	   It survived, of course, and currently does battle with "ER" as well as ABC's
"20/20 Downtown," with which it shares 69th place in households for the season
thus far, according to Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
	   But the scrappy "48 Hours" has also assumed a role as pinch hitter, filling
as many as three hours per week to shore up trouble spots in the CBS schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   "When they have a problem, they come to us," says Zirinsky, referring to CBS
programming execs. "I like playing utility."
</P>
<P>
	   The clear message is, she loves her job. But don't mistake her happiness at
"48 Hours" for complacency. That's just not Zirinsky's style.
</P>
<P>
	   "I love to be scared," she declares with undisguised relish. "It was either
this or neurosurgery. And I was too short to lean over the operating table."

<HEADLINE> Housing Starts Rise in January  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Housing construction sprinted ahead in January to the
highest level in a year, suggesting that rising mortgage rates have yet to
sideline confident consumers, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aided by mild weather early in the month, builders began work on new units
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.78 million, a 1.5 percent increase
over December, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That marked the highest
level since January 1999 when 1.80 million units were started.
</P>
<P>
	   The increase surprised many analysts who were predicting that housing starts
would fall given the upswing in mortgage rates and the harsh weather that raked
parts of the country late in the month.
</P>
<P>
	   "The seemingly insatiable demand for new homes continues to overcome any
increases in mortgage rates," said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic
Advisors.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans are feeling wealthy and in the buying mood despite higher mortgage
rates, economists said. Plentiful jobs, rising incomes and stock market gains
propelled consumer confidence to a record high in January.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you have consumer confidence that high, you can keep the housing
market going even with rates topping 8 percent," said David Seiders, chief
economist for the National Association of Home Builders.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was
8.21 percent, up from 6.79 percent in January 1999. Last week, mortgage rates
climbed to 8.36 percent, a 3 1/2-year high.
</P>
<P>
	   The higher rates, however, are dampening builders' expectations for current
home sales as well as sales six months from now, according to a new survey by
the home builders association.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates four times since June to slow
the red-hot economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though those rate increases made borrowing more expensive for consumers
and businesses, the higher rates still haven't significantly slowed housing
activity. Sales of both new and existing homes hit new highs in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Many economists widely expect the Fed will bump up interest rates again in
March, and said Wednesday's report justifies such a move. Those economists
believe the economy continues to grow at a too-rapid pace that probably can't be
sustained without triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   New building permits, a barometer of future construction activity, grew by a
breakneck 8.7 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.76 million,
the highest level in a year.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, housing starts were up in all parts of the country except for
the Northeast, where they fell.
</P>
<P>
	   In the West, starts rose by 7.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 384,000 units. Starts rose 0.7 percent in the Midwest to a rate of 412,000
units and they grew by 0.6 percent in the South to 829,000 units. In the
Northeast, starts fell by 4.5 percent to a rate of 150,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, starts of single-family homes declined by 2.1 percent in January
but were still left at a brisk seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.4 million
units.
</P>
<P>
	   And, starts of apartments and condos and other multiple-family housing rose
to a rate of 379,000 units, a huge 17.7 percent jump reflecting in part a new
broader definition that now includes housing projects for the elderly,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, housing starts rose by a sizzling 5.1 percent, but were weaker
than the government originally estimated.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Warned of Pacemaker Problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LITTLE CANADA, Minn. (AP) -- St. Jude Medical Inc. has informed doctors that
a small number of its Affinity model pacemakers could malfunction and stop
emitting the electrical signal that regulates a patient's heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Jude said 33 of the its 35,000 Affinity pacemakers have been reported
having problems, though the company is unaware of any patient injuries,
spokesman Peter Gove said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 891 pacemakers -- 640 in the United States -- that St. Jude has
identified as potentially having the problem, the company believes about 90 are
affected, said Gove.
</P>
<P>
	   That leaves about 60 pacemakers that may exhibit the problem within the next
two years, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the vast majority of patients, all their doctor will do is continue to
monitor them. If the problem presents itself, they will then decide whether to
replace the pulse generator," Gove said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pacemaker is implanted in a pocket under the skin in the pectoral
muscle. Gove said replacing the pulse generator typically is outpatient surgery.
The company said it would pay up to $800 of any patient's unreimbursed medical
expenses for any such surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been advised of St. Jude's letter
to doctors, said Gove, adding that no recall order has been issued.
</P>
<P>
	   Pacemakers help patients with slow heartbeats -- a condition known as
bradycardia. Normally the condition is not life-threatening. However, a small
number of patients are dependent on their pacemakers and could die if the device
stops working.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Jude Medical is nation's second largest pacemaker manufacturer, behind
Medtronic Inc. About 300,000 St. Jude pacemakers of all types are in use in the
United States, Gove said.

    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   In the birthday spotlight:
</P>
<P>
	   Kristin Davis, one of the stars of HBO's "Sex and the City," played the
devious Brooke Armstrong on "Melrose Place" a few seasons back. Davis, who was
born on Feb. 23, 1965, is enjoying her new TV role. On "Melrose Place," the
women characters were "all really mean to each other," Davis says. So "it was
nice to get 'Sex and the City,' where the four women are all friends and that's
a given, and everything else revolves around them."
</P>
<P>
	   French Stewart's trademark expression on "3rd Rock From the Sun" wasn't
something the show's producers dreamed up. "I came in with the squint," Stewart
says. "I knew the character was an idiot, and it gave me a dull, uncomprehending
look." Stewart, who was born on Feb. 20, 1964, plays alien Harry Solomon on the
NBC sitcom.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope I'll be able to make the full transition into adult roles," says
Jennifer Love Hewitt, who won Favorite Female Performer in a New Television
Series at this year's People's Choice Awards. Hewitt, who was born on Feb. 21,
1979, won the award for her role in "Time of Your Life," which airs on Fox
television. "The good news is, I know I'll be able to make the transition in
real life -- no matter what," she says. Hewitt is also a singer-songwriter.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Nigel Kennedy  </HEADLINE>
    By MARY CAMPBELL AP Newsfeatures Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Some people call Nigel Kennedy a punk violinist. (Maybe
it's the haircut.) But he plays classical music -- most of the time.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm playing gigs all the time, basically. I'm a traveling violinist," said
Kennedy, 43, an English violin prodigy who studied at the Menuhin School in
England from 7 to 16 and then at Manhattan's Juilliard School.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy chose 20 short pieces for himself and the English Chamber Orchestra
for "Classic Kennedy," just released by EMI. It is his first album of short
works, and much of the music is familiar. The album begins with "Summer" from
Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons." It also includes Massenet's beautiful "Meditation"
from "Thais," Bach's "Air on a G String" and Rimsky-Korsakov's "Flight of the
Bumble Bee." The album ends with a piece by Joni Mitchell and one by Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the public doesn't make the distinction, he uses the name Kennedy
for classical music and Nigel Kennedy for other projects, including his
eight-piece band. The latest record he made with his band was inspired by
melodic fragments of Jimi Hendrix's music and played on acoustic instruments.
</P>
<P>
	   1. Why do some people call you a punk violinist?
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy: Maybe my haircut. The jacket I wear on stage is almost falling to
pieces. It's light material which doesn't get in the way of my bow arm. It's not
so formal as the black-and-white scheme everyone uses. But I don't find
attractive the idea of playing two chords loudly out of tune. Punk rock brought
music back to the people. Anyone can do it, without financial barriers. I like
that idea. That's my link to the punk thing.
</P>
<P>
	   2. Have you ever wanted to be a rock musician?
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy: I'm not drawn to be a rock performer. I've always been very keen to
avoid any genre preconceptions. I'm interested in the music itself. There's
nothing I like better than playing Beethoven with a symphony, straight-ahead
jazz with a great jazz group, or playing some top rock music with a great
musician like Robert Plant. I never said to myself, 'I want to be like one of
those types of musicians.' I like music to be an adventure.
</P>
<P>
	   3. How did you start in music?
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy: My mom was a single mother and a piano teacher and that doesn't
bring in money for baby sitters. I sat under the piano. It took me a long time
before I enjoyed playing violin. I got into the Menuhin School on piano. Yehudi
Menuhin invented a scholarship for me.
</P>
<P>
	   3 1/2. Why the violin?
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy: There was a feeling it would be nicer if I played the violin. At
first I got a fairly gruesome sound. At one point I wanted to be a cellist. I
didn't meet them, but my father and grandfather were both cellists. The first
couple of years I wasn't making great progress and I was unhappy away from home.
I would look for the darker, deeper side of the violin instead of the shrill,
pristine sound it's well capable of making.
</P>
<P>
	   4. Why did you take a sabbatical from music in the mid-1990s?
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy: It was described as a sabbatical. I was doing music all the time,
apart from seven months when I had an operation on my neck and was healing. I
practiced Bach every morning. I learned a bit of cello, saxophone and guitar. I
wrote my own music. I said, 'I'm never going to play classical music again. If
you're going to record me, you're going to have to record my stuff.' No way
could I believe, inside, I wasn't going to approach classical music again. Bach
is like all values of music rolled into one. It was the only way I could assert
myself, drawing a really sharp line. I want to tour three or four months a year
performing with orchestras and then do random collaborations. Eric Clapton
called up, Santana and Martha Argerich. In the old days I would say, 'I'm
honored to be asked but I haven't got time to do it.'
</P>
<P>
	   5. What is most important to you?
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy: My relationship with composers and fellow musicians. When everybody
is on the same level and realm of consciousness, it's almost like the music is
playing you rather than you making something happen in a willful manner. That
may happen one out of eight or 10 nights. I find it happens quite a lot in my
music. I've got such a good band around me, improvising. It happens a lot with
Bach, Brahms, Elgar and Bartok.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Lonestar  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM PATTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- "Is my Frappuccino ready YET!?" shouts Lonestar
drummer Keech Rainwater at an unseen minion during a break in a recording
session.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of his gourmet coffee drink, Rainwater is answered with laughter
from lead singer Richie McDonald and keyboardist Dean Sams. He joins in, and the
message is clear: Although Lonestar is one of the hottest groups in country
music -- thanks to the crossover hit "Amazed" -- members of this hard-working
band aren't even close to getting swelled heads.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've all dug a ditch before, we've all delivered pizzas," McDonald said.
"We've all had less desirable jobs. ... This is a dream for us."
</P>
<P>
	   Lonestar was nominated for a Grammy for best country performance by a duo or
group for "Amazed," which was nominated for song of the year. In addition,
producer Dan Huff was nominated for producer of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would say it's THE most significant thing to happen to us thus far," Sams
said. "The Grammys is the cat-daddy of all the awards because it's all genres of
music. It's probably the most prestigious awards show out there."
</P>
<P>
	   Band members took a break at a recording studio outside Nashville, where
they are working on two new albums, to reflect on how their lives have changed
since "Amazed" spent eight weeks at No. 1 last year and helped sell 2 million
copies of their "Lonely Grill" album.
</P>
<P>
	   "We got in town yesterday, and a few of us were at the circus last night
with our families," Sams said. "We got going early this morning and we'll record
all day and night. There are meetings all week long until we leave town again
Thursday and go back on the road for like three weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a crazy schedule, but it just goes to show, be careful what you wish
for."
</P>
<P>
	   Lonestar began when Sams and McDonald met in Texas at an audition for a job
at the now defunct Opryland USA theme park in Nashville. They moved to Nashville
and formed the band with Rainwater, guitarist Michael Britt and bassist John
Rich.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Lonestar, they called themselves Texassee. Unlike many other
Nashville country groups, they earned their stripes in the honky-tonks instead
of being put together by a producer and going directly to a recording studio.
</P>
<P>
	   And boy, did they pay their dues. Using a Jeep Cherokee and an equipment
trailer, they played some 500 shows over two years.
</P>
<P>
	   "At first we were a cover band, just to pay the rent," McDonald said. "We
spent a lot of nights in a lot of dives -- places that some nights we wished
that we hadn't been there.
</P>
<P>
	   "But we look back now and feel that those were dues we paid that were well
worth it. We created a sound, writing together, and got better as musicians and
writers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a chance for us to figure out who we were, and make sure that we all
wanted the same thing. Seven years later, it's all paid off."
</P>
<P>
	   The group got noticed as the first band to play the Wildhorse Saloon, now a
prominent venue in downtown Nashville. They were signed by BNA Records, and
their first single "Tequila Talkin"' was a Top 5 hit.
</P>
<P>
	   Two successful albums were released, and the singles "No News" and
"Everything's Changed" were big hits. But listeners tended to confuse Lonestar
with other bands, and the group struggled to be identified with its own songs.
Rich left in 1997 to pursue a solo career.
</P>
<P>
	   Then "Amazed," a sweeping love ballad, put Lonestar at the top of the
country music world for eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first three weeks it was No. 1 we were like, 'This is cool,"' McDonald
said. "Then after that, we started thinking something's happening here that you
only hear happening to other artists."
</P>
<P>
	   Rainwater adds: "We thought the computer was stuck or something."

<HEADLINE> Steel Pulse Gets Reggae Grammy Nod  </HEADLINE>
    By MARY CAMPBELL AP Newsfeatures Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's been nearly 15 years since Steel Pulse won a Grammy
Award for "Babylon the Bandit." But the reggae band is hoping to win another one
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a close shave two years ago," said lead singer-musician-composer
David Hinds. "We were nominated for 'Rage and Fury.' Ziggy Marley walked off
with it."
</P>
<P>
	   "Living Legacy," which was recorded live, is one of the nominees for best
reggae album. Rhythm guitarist Hinds, who writes most of the group's songs, said
about 70 percent of the songs on the album are political.
</P>
<P>
	   Steel Pulse is seven instrumentalists plus two female backup singers. Hinds,
singer-keyboardist Selwin Brown and drummer Steve Nesbitt were born in
Birmingham, England, and their parents were born in rural areas of the West
Indies. Hinds, Brown and Nesbitt have been with the band since its start.
</P>
<P>
	   "Living Legacy" includes "Islands Unite," which Hinds wrote with the idea
that the Caribbean islands would be stronger if they united for trade; "Ku Klux
Klan," his idea of what would happen if the Ku Klux Klan came to England; and
"Back to My Roots," which came from criticism the band endured "for watering
down the music and drifting away from our initial ideals of spirituality and
grinding against the status quo."
</P>
<P>
	   "It is true we changed somewhat to dance hall music," he said. "We had
lyrics of lighter entertainment and used the music as beat music. Once it was
100 percent political. We made it 50-50. Record companies wanted something they
could get played on the radio. We bobbed and weaved to maintain the band's
survival in the industry."
</P>
<P>
	   When those attempts to be commercial didn't sell very well, "what kept us
going was live performances," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The band got its start in 1975, a time when there was a "rock against
racism" movement in England, Hinds said. "It was the point when punk rock bands
were questioning the status quo and the system. They had reggae acts as opening
acts. Reggae and punk in the same venues was like a will to enforce racial
harmony, with black and white in the same auditorium because of the music."
</P>
<P>
	   "England had the National Front, an equivalent of your Ku Klux Klan,
marching through communities," he said. "'Rock against racism' was to counteract
what they stood for. We were very much a part of that. Then ska and racially
mixed bands became popular and reggae bands had to retreat. Ska was the earliest
form of reggae, a music form we'd left behind 20 years before. We survived. We'd
already made an impression in France, Holland, Denmark and Germany. We got to
the U.S., where reggae was still respected, in the '80s."
</P>
<P>
	   Steel Pulse's first live album "Rastafari Centennial," from a concert in
Paris, was followed in 1995 by "Vex," which was recorded in Jamaica. Hinds said
those two recordings in the band's original style were a turning point for Steel
Pulse.
</P>
<P>
	   "The song 'Back to My Roots' was coming from a vow we made that we won't be
hitting the commercial road any more," Hinds said. "We lost our souls but we got
them back. In 1997, we released 'Rage and Fury,' which got much acclaim."
</P>
<P>
	   Hinds summed things up in this way: "We're back on track and mean business.
... We've got bills to pay. But we're trying to toe the line and keep the band
very much alive. I don't even know how to approach anything commercially any
more."

<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Strutting in a pair of olive micro shorts and a green
cashmere top, Victoria "Posh Spice" Beckham made her catwalk debut at London
Fashion Week on Wednesday -- and encapsulated British designers' sassy, sexy
look for fall and winter 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "The whole thing is about freedom, about the free spirit of the woman who is
really a gypsy," said designer Maria Grachvogel, a friend of the star, who did
not charge for her appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   To underline the theme, Grachvogel sent Beckham floating down the runway at
the end of the show in a long burgundy strapless gown slit to the thigh above a
flamboyant flamenco frill piped in pink that flounced away into a small train.
</P>
<P>
	   The master of the brilliant cut, Anthony Symonds, tantalized with a
selection of tight pencil skirts, chic tunics with high funnel necks and
cashmere sweaters and dresses with knitted rose "corsages." Floppy knit bows
highlighted breasts and hips.
</P>
<P>
	   Past British Designer of the Year Betty Jackson showed shirtdresses with
wide lapels and oversized shirts in lime green and red check worn with low-slung
heavy black or red belts accented with studs or bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
	   After defecting to New York last year, the "bad boy" of British fashion,
Alexander McQueen, was back -- but his collection of fur items got him into
trouble with animal rights protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   They broke into the film studio where McQueen was due to show and daubed
anti-fur slogans on several backdrops. But they did not manage to disrupt the
event, which featured black astrakhan skirts and leather dresses with panels of
rabbit fur.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 40 designers staged shows on the grounds of London's Natural
History Museum or assorted restaurants, hotels and ateliers around the city.
Nearly 150 designers showed accessories at an exhibition that runs alongside.
</P>
<P>
	   Welsh knitwear wizard Julien McDonald planned to round off the week with a
much-hyped show at the Millennium Dome.

<HEADLINE> Kerrey To Lead New School University  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEDLAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Sen. Bob Kerrey, who announced last month he would not
seek a third term, said Wednesday he will take a job offer as president of New
School University in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've had a longstanding passion and love of education and an interest in
doing more,'' Kerrey said. ``This is what I would like to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kerrey, 56, said he would start working for the university next January,
after he officially has left office. He said he will not sign a contract or
address the details of his new position until that time. The school, founded in
1919 and originally known as the New School for Social Research, has 7,000
degree students and 20,000 continuing education students.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerrey, who taught a college course in California in the 1980s, said he
would like to teach a course at the university on making laws. In addition,
Kerrey said, he would like to expand adult education programs and the
university's use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope to solve more problems than I can create,'' Kerrey said in a
telephone interview from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerrey, who operates a chain of restaurants and health clubs in Nebraska,
said he plans to remain a presence in his home state even though he will be
moving to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I had been offered the presidency to the University of Nebraska, I may
be talking now of moving to Lincoln,'' Kerrey said. ``My businesses will keep me
involved in Nebraska. I will be a grateful taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kerrey said ``it's certainly a nice coincidence'' that New York is the home
of his longtime girlfriend, Sara Paley, a former writer for ``Saturday Night
Live.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, John L. Tishman, chairman of the school's board of trustees,
lauded Kerrey's ``values, dedication to education, energy level and passion for
gathering the best minds to solve problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kerrey's decision not to run for a third term had been a setback for
Democratic hopes of making gains in the Senate. The Senate has a 55-45
Republican majority, and Kerrey's seat was considered a safe one in a state that
traditionally votes Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Senate, Kerrey established himself as an expert on agriculture, an
advocate for major health care reforms and a liberal voice on defense matters,
including voting against going to war in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerrey, millionaire, Vietnam war hero and former governor, won election in
the Senate in 1988 by defeating appointed incumbent Sen. David Karnes. In 1992,
he withdrew a presidential bid after failing to win much support in any primary
except South Dakota. He won a second Senate term in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Spotlight on TLC's T-Boz  </HEADLINE>
    By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tionne Watkins, better known as T-Boz of TLC, decided to
write what she felt one particularly mournful night and came up with her first
poem, "Unpretty," about a woman made to feel unattractive by her mate.
</P>
<P>
	   The poem was included in "Thoughts," her first book of poetry, which was
published by HarperCollins last fall. Most of the poems are no more than a few
lines, touching on various topics from child abuse to groupies. The book
includes pictures from her scrapbook and short stories about her life. There is
a companion spoken-word CD.
</P>
<P>
	   T-Boz, 29, cheerfully admits that she doesn't read much poetry. "I'm a
person who doesn't like to read," she said. "I have a short attention span.
That's why I formatted my book to people like me. ... I was just going for
all-around, something nice to look at, and you get something out of it, too."
</P>
<P>
	   Producers set "Unpretty" to music, and it became the latest in a long string
of successes for the R&AMP;B trio, which includes Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes and Rozonda
"Chilli" Thomas.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unpretty" is nominated for song of the year at this year's Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
	   TLC's "FanMail" is nominated for album of the year and "No Scrubs" is
nominated for record of the year. Other Grammy nominations are best pop
performance by a duo or group with vocal for "Unpretty," best R&AMP;B performance by
a duo or group with vocal for "No Scrubs," best R&AMP;B song for "No Scrubs," best
R&AMP;B album for "FanMail" and best short-form music video for "Unpretty."
</P>
<P>
	   Watkins is particularly excited about her nomination as a songwriter for
"Unpretty."
</P>
<P>
	   "That's probably the one that meant the most to me because I know for a fact
that I did this, for real," she said proudly in her scratchy, deep voice. "It
doesn't even matter if I win anymore, it's just the point that I got nominated.
... I just can't believe it."
</P>
<P>
	   The same sentiment of disbelief could apply to much of TLC's career. The
group has sold millions of records -- including "Baby-Baby-Baby," "Creep" and
"Waterfalls" -- since its first album debuted in 1992. But with success has come
turmoil. The trio declared bankruptcy a few years ago, citing poorly structured
recording contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Watkins, an effervescent bleached blonde with a honey complexion, has been
hospitalized several times, suffering from sickle cell anemia, a serious blood
disease. Lopes wants to pursue a solo career. And infighting among group members
has been reported in the press.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Watkins dismisses talk of a serious rift.
</P>
<P>
	   "With three women, you agree to disagree. I'm not always going to agree with
Lisa and she's not always going to agree with me, that's fine," she said. "But
we're getting along."
</P>
<P>
	   She hopes TLC will stay together, but "if anything was to ever happen, God
forbid, then it was just meant to be that way. ... If someone wants to go, I
would never hold them back, I would wish them the best."
</P>
<P>
	   Watkins has plenty of other interests to keep her busy.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm producing movies, cartoons, I'm doing other things, so I'm using this
business to my advantage, to do other things to pursue other goals and dreams,"
she said. "I will never just rely on singing, because that's a check that's hard
to get, that's the truth about this business."
</P>
<P>
	   Watkins is developing what she describes as a "family morals cartoon with a
lot of humor" for Jim Henson Productions.
</P>
<P>
	   And she is planning her summer wedding to West Coast rapper Mack 10. She
gleefully talked about her impending nuptials as she gazed at her eye-popping
diamond engagement ring.
</P>
<P>
	   These days, Watkins is feeling anything but "Unpretty."
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't had nearly as many crises since I'm happier now, and I'm
healthier than I've ever been in my whole entire life," Watkins said.

<HEADLINE> Better Colon Cancer Gene Test Cited  </HEADLINE>
    By MALCOLM RITTER AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Scientists say that they've found a more thorough way to detect gene flaws
that promote colon cancer, and that the technique should improve testing for
genetic susceptibility to other diseases as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Their approach avoids a biological "cover-up" that can foil attempts to
survey particular genes for mutations.
</P>
<P>
	   The work is presented in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature by a team
including Dr. Bert Vogelstein of the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore
and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers studied patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal
cancer, or HNPCC, which accounts for 4 percent to 5 percent of colon cancers.
While standard testing could not find mutations in particular genes in 10 of the
22 patients, the experimental procedure let researchers identify the abnormal
genes in all the patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Genes lie along rod-like structures called chromosomes, and people have two
copies of nearly all chromosomes. That can hinder mutation-seeking tests because
if a gene on one chromosome is mutated, the abnormality can be masked by the
gene's normal counterpart on the other chromosome. Vogelstein's study
demonstrated a way to separate chromosomes, so each copy of a gene can be
analyzed by itself.
</P>
<P>
	   To do the separation, researchers fuse millions of human cells to specially
developed mouse cells. This destroys most of the human chromosomes, but
different chromosomes survive in different hybrids. Scientists can then find
hybrids that contain a single copy of particular chromosomes. These can be used
for standard mutation testing.
</P>
<P>
	   Such cell fusions have been done for decades. But the new work is an advance
because researchers developed a line of mouse cells that is far more useful for
genetic testing, Vogelstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   Vogelstein said he believed the technique could help many tests for flawed
genes that promote diseases, although the amount of improvement would depend on
the nature of the genes and mutations involved.
</P>
<P>
	   Separating chromosomes is "a great idea," said gene expert Dr. Arthur
Beaudet of the Baylor College of Medicine.

<HEADLINE> Czech Banker Resigns Over Loan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- The chief executive of Komercni Banka, the
nation's largest commercial bank, resigned Wednesday over a large unsecured loan
to an Austrian company that has gone bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
	   Tne bank said Jan Koller resigned after an investigation confirmed the
Komercni Banka had made an outstanding unsecured loan of over $195 million to
the company which was not identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Komercni Banka is the country's largest commercial bank in terms of assets
and is being prepared for privatization later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say a loan worth nearly $200 million is too large for a bank of
Komercni Banka's size and represents a substantial credit risk.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has already agreed to transfer a portion of the bank's
previous bad loans to the state-run debt financing bank Konsolidacni Banka.
</P>
<P>
	   Finance Minister Pavel Mertlik repeatedly has called for substantial
personnel changes in Komercni Banka.

<HEADLINE> Federally Insured Thrift Approved  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A trade association representing insurance companies
owned by their policyholders has won permission from federal regulators to
operate a new federally insured thrift.
</P>
<P>
	   The Office of Thrift Supervision announced Wednesday its approval for the
National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies to establish the thrift. It
will be named Assurance Partners Bank and will operate nationwide from an office
in Carmel, Ind.
</P>
<P>
	   The new thrift will offer home mortgages, home equity loans and small
business loans. Money for the loans will come from insurance companies that
belong to the trade group as well as from individual depositors in the thrift.
</P>
<P>
	   Assurance Partners Bank plans to do most of its marketing to customers of
insurance agents who work for companies belonging to NAMIC, which has about
1,100 members in the United States, Canada and Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Several big U.S. insurance companies have gone public recently or plan to,
transforming themselves from mutual companies owned by policyholders to stock
companies owned by shareholders. The companies are making the move to raise
capital for new acquisitions in the rapidly consolidating financial services
industry, spurred by legislation enacted last November allowing banks,
securities firms and insurers to get into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   In a related move Wednesday, the Office of Thrift Supervision also announced
it had given AXA Financial Inc., parent of Equitable Life Assurance Society and
brokerage firm Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc., to convert its state-chartered
trust company in Fargo, N.D., to a federally insured thrift.
</P>
<P>
	   The approval makes AXA Financial the latest in a string of insurance
companies, securities firms and other businesses outside the banking industry to
get new federal savings and loan charters in recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year the thrift agency, part of the Treasury Department, granted
similar charters to Aetna Inc., one of the nation's largest life and health
insurers, mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments and American International
Group Inc., another major U.S. insurance company.
</P>
<P>
	   So far this year, the thrift regulators have approved online brokerage
ETrade Group Inc.'s acquisition of Telebanc Financial Corp., which created the
first financial services company entirely based on the Internet, and new thrifts
to be operated by Southwest Securities Group Inc. and 1st Virtual Inc.

<HEADLINE> Imprisoned Market Forecaster Talks  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Instead of a pinstriped suit, Martin A. Armstrong is
wearing a prison-issue brown jumpsuit. Instead of expensive leather shoes, he
has on blue canvas shoes, no laces.
</P>
<P>
	   Just six months ago, the oft-quoted market forecaster from Princeton, N.J.,
drove a BMW, flew first-class, and stayed in the best hotels. He spent summers
at his $2 million beach house on the Jersey shore.
</P>
<P>
	   Now Armstrong, founder of Princeton Economics International Ltd., is accused
of committing one of the biggest securities frauds in history. He was sent to
the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan on Jan. 14 for
contempt of court after failing to turn over corporate assets and records.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first in-depth interview since the FBI raided his company in
September, Armstrong talked with The Associated Press about his life from riches
to rags.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong, 50, is no easy character sketch. One minute he's talking about
economic theory, the next minute he says he's the target of a U.S. government
conspiracy. But ultimately what is most striking is his will to get up off the
mat again and again.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities allege Armstrong sold $3 billion worth of securities to Japanese
companies, pledging to repay them with interest. Instead of putting the money in
conservative bonds as promised, he made risky bets on currencies and other
investments. Faced with mounting losses, he tried to hide the truth from
investors by giving them false account statements, they allege.
</P>
<P>
	   He repaid $2 billion, but still owes $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong acknowledges he was helping Japanese companies mask and try to
reverse their own losses. But he blames executives at Republic Bank of New York,
where the funds were held, for mishandling the accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   In many ways, the journey that Armstrong took started when he was 13. His
family was preparing for a European vacation. "I wanted to have my own spending
money. So I got a part-time job at a gold and bullion shop," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   But his weekend job helping out behind the counter became his passion in
high school when he saw the 1937 film "The Toast of New York," about Jim Fisk,
the 19th century medicine showman who became a notorious Wall Street financier.
Fisk went bust trying to corner the gold market in 1869.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew gold was $35 an ounce, and there I was in history class watching
Cary Grant (who played Fisk's partner Nick Boyd) reading the ticker tape quoting
gold at $162 an ounce ... . I began to find that very curious, so I started
doing reading on my own," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong's hand makes a wave-motion in the air as he describes learning
about the cyclical nature of gold prices.
</P>
<P>
	   His own life has followed a similar pattern of ups and downs: Armstrong
claims he was a millionaire at 15, but eight years later he was ostracized by
stamp collectors for fraud. He became a commodities consultant and charged
$2,000 an hour, but he owed millions in back taxes. He says he advised foreign
governments on financial issues, yet he filed for personal bankruptcy in 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about this pattern of success and failure, Armstrong blames U.S.
government agencies, saying, "They're paranoid ... . Once you beat them, they
keep coming back at you."
</P>
<P>
	   When Armstrong was a teen-ager, he was probably a lot like a young Jim Fisk.
Armstrong saw an opportunity when the U.S. Mint switched from silver quarters to
coupro-nickle clad quarters between 1964 and 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would go down to the bank and buy $100 and ask for quarters and take out
the silver and sell it," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   But a 15-year-old with $1 million?
</P>
<P>
	   "The 60s was a pretty wild period ... . There were some Canadian pennies
which had -- they made a rare variety, and I had kind of lucked out and got some
of them, and then bought some others, and they went up in value quite
dramatically to the point that my mother thought people were crazy. (Coin
collectors) would fly down and buy a roll of pennies from me for $600 apiece and
she wanted to know what was going on," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong's remarkable claims of early success could not be corroborated,
and his business practices later came under fire when he started selling rare
postage stamps.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1972, when Armstrong was 23, he was expelled from a prestigious stamp
collectors' group, the American Philatelic Society.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Lamb, executive director for the organization, says Armstrong was
banned because customers complained he did not fill their mail orders or refund
their money.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's not true," Armstrong says. "There was an old coot there and they
expelled me because I was a minor. I was running a business, and I wasn't 21."
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong went on to write three reference books on stamp collecting, but
his stamp business declined.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong didn't miss a beat. He turned his love of coins and precious
metals into a commodities forecasting newsletter.
</P>
<P>
	   In May 1983, he founded Princeton Economic Consultants in the city of the
same name, with no affiliation to the Ivy League university. His success seemed
instantaneous -- one month later he was quoted in The Wall Street Journal as a
high-priced consultant who charged "clients $2,000 an hour for private
consultations. Those who don't need a full hour can talk to Mr. Armstrong for
$33.50 a minute."
</P>
<P>
	   Within two years, by 1985, his company had offices in Geneva and London,
according to The International Herald Tribune, which described Armstrong's
clients as "ranging from South African gold mines to national governments."
</P>
<P>
	   Behind the headlines, though, Armstrong was in trouble again.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a complaint against him in
1985 because he was not a registered commodity adviser, and another complaint in
1987 for not keeping proper records.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong recalls, "They hit me with that subpoena to force me to turn over
all my lists of clients worldwide, which I denied ... . Then they went to the
FBI and accused me of mail fraud saying that I was selling subscriptions (of his
newsletter) and not giving them to some. I was then raided by 30 or so FBI
agents." He says the claims of mail fraud were "total B.S." He was never
prosecuted for mail fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   Around the same time, the state of New Jersey went after Armstrong for
failing to collect sales tax on gold bullion sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong disputed the interpretation of the law, claiming he, himself, had
written the law at the behest of state Sen. Walter E. Foran. If Armstrong indeed
had a hand in writing the bill, it never became law because Foran's 1980 bill
was vetoed by the governor. Foran died in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong fought the tax case to the state Supreme Court where he lost and
was ordered to pay more than $600,000 in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service raided Armstrong's office for not
keeping records on bullion purchases and sales over $10,000. IRS agents seized
his records and kept them for three years, he says, preventing him from filing
tax returns.
</P>
<P>
	   By September 1987, Armstrong's debts totaled $4.4 million, including $2.7
million in unpaid taxes. The day before Capitol State Bank was set to foreclose
on his home, Armstrong filed personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his success, Armstrong's only assets were his $344,000 house in
Pennington, N.J., $350 in cash, a gold ring, and some stock in his company that
later turned out to be worthless.
</P>
<P>
	   His dire financial straits were surprising, given his reputation as a savvy
market forecaster. Armstrong and several of his clients, for example, claimed he
predicted the October 1987 stock market crash, which happened less than a month
after Armstrong sought protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Armstrong seemed unfazed by his unpaid bills and continued to expand
his business, opening offices in Hong Kong, Australia and Tokyo. When Armstrong
started raising money from Japanese investors in 1991, he was still in the
process of liquidating his estate.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong says he didn't know his bankruptcy case was still open. His memory
on the dates is poor. "I thought it was discharged in '86 or '87. I didn't find
out about that until the early '90s when the Internal Revenue Service sent me a
bill."
</P>
<P>
	   When Armstrong's bankruptcy case was closed in August 1993, the IRS and the
state of New Jersey each got $10,733 in back taxes. No other creditor got a
dime.
</P>
<P>
	   But Armstrong bounced right back, and three months later bought a $1.24
million beach house using the name of his newest company, Princeton Global
Management Holdings -- one in a web of companies with the Princeton name that he
allegedly controls. The home is worth more than $2 million, according to sales
agents.
</P>
<P>
	   That same year, Armstrong lost his fight against the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission when the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against him.
</P>
<P>
	   He has never paid the $12,000 fine to the CFTC, and according to Armstrong,
he won that case.
</P>
<P>
	   Blacklisted by regulators from U.S. commodity markets, Armstrong simply
avoided their scrutiny by managing offshore investments for foreign clients.
</P>
<P>
	   In Japan, he distributed sales literature to companies and spoke at
seminars. His claims about his credentials stretched the truth.
</P>
<P>
	   His resume, for example, said he had been "studying market behavior since
1962." In fact, Armstrong was 13 in 1962. It also said he "holds a degree in
Computer Science and Engineering." It did not mention the degree is from a
two-year program at RCA Institute, a technical school in Cherry Hill, N.J.,
which no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong says he has not seen the marketing resume, which was submitted in
court papers by the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent interviews, Japanese investors said they were unaware of
Armstrong's bankruptcy or trouble with regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we had known, we would never have bought (the securities)," said Takeo
Nakahara, a manager at Maspro Denko, a Japanese electronics company. "In the end
it was all a fraud."
</P>
<P>
	   At least 26 of Armstrong's Japanese clients have filed lawsuits against him
in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging fraud and
racketeering.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors say Armstrong lost almost $500 million trading the
Japanese yen and other investments between 1997 and 1999. Investigators are
still searching hundreds of accounts and dozens of companies for the other $500
million he owes.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, Armstrong's personal and business assets have been frozen, and U.S.
District Court Judge Richard Owen has thrown Armstrong in jail for failing to
turn over $1 million in gold bars, $1.3 million in gold coins, plus antiques and
corporate records. The judge appeared particularly annoyed that the four
computers Armstrong surrendered had been damaged or their files recently erased.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong testified that he erased the files accidentally. He said he had
done his best to turn over the assets, but wanted more time.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is $1.3 million in coins that are missing. You have pleaded earnestly
with me that you have not had a chance to look for them," Owen said on finding
Armstrong in contempt. "I don't believe that. I believe you know exactly where
they are."
</P>
<P>
	   If Armstrong does not agree to turn over the missing assets, he must prove
he does not have them. Otherwise, he may spend the next 18 months in jail while
his civil and criminal trials proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the many peaks and valleys in Armstrong's life, this appears to be a new
low. And yet, he is unbowed.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am a pretty good (computer) programmer," says Armstrong, planning his
comeback. "I think I would go into developing products along the line of
Microsoft -- computer software."

<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The number of unemployed people fell last month to a near
20-year low, the British government announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of people claiming unemployment benefits decreased by 9,800 in
January to 1.158 million, the lowest since March 1980 when it was 1.136 million,
according to the Office of National Statistics.
</P>

includes people not eligible for benefits, dropped by 4,000 to 1.718 million
people in the three months ending Dec. 31, the office said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ILO unemployment rate for the quarter was 5.9 percent, unchanged from

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 85.01; Nasdaq Up 49.50  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as a pair of strong corporate
profit reports helped technology stocks edge back from a recent slump but blue
chips fell.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 85.01 at 10,633.08.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 6.55 at 1,395.50, and the high-tech dominated Nasdaq composite index was up
49.50 at 4,470.27.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Applied Materials rose 7 5/8 to 174 1/8 after announcing
stronger-than-expected profits and a robust outlook for the coming year. The
company, a leading maker of chip-manufacturing equipment, earned $328.5 million,
or 80 cents per share, in its most recent quarter. Analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 77 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Applied Materials also announced it will split its stock two shares for one
effective March 15.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader semiconductor sector rose on Applied Materials' report of strong
customer demand. LSI Logic rose 6 to 104 1/4 and Texas Instuments rose 3 1/8 to
138 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Lycos, maker of a popular Internet search engine, rose 4 5/16 to 73 3/8. The
company said late Tuesday it earned 3 cents per share in its fiscal second
quarter, beating analysts' estimates of 1 cent per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, investors' favorites for the past several months, have
struggled in the past three sessions as traders sold shares to collect profits.
Today, they edged back at the expense of blue-chips like Coca-Cola, down 2 1/16
at 53 5/8, and Procter &AMP; Gamble, down 1 7/8 at 93 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors remained on edge over concerns that the rapid growth of the
U.S. economy will persuade the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest
rates to raise the cost of borrowing money and force a slowdown. The Fed, which
has raised rates four times since last June, fears the booming economy will
eventually spark a rise in inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The U.S. economy doesn't seem to be slowing down at all," said Alan
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. "Stocks
continue to climb a wall of worry over higher interest rates."
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest-rate
fluctuations, were mostly lower today. American Express fell 6 1/8 to 153 and
PaineWebber fell 1 3/16 to 37.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan will address the House Banking
Committee in his semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. Analysts said investors
will listen carefully to his testimony on the state of the economy, seeking
clues to the Fed's sentiment.
</P>
<P>
	   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancers by a
4-to-3 margin. NYSE volume came to 682.78 million shares, compared with 710.42
at the same time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.69 to 547.93.

<HEADLINE> Builders Oppose Hastert Decision  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a blunt threat, construction companies told House
Speaker Dennis Hastert on Wednesday that they've decided ``to draw a line in the
sand'' on future campaign donations because of his decision to delay action on
their bill aimed at reining in job safety and labor law regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   Associated Builders and Contractors is ``going to be very, very selective
with our PAC (political action committee) money,'' with donations going to
``only those members of Congress who are willing to stand with us shoulder to
shoulder,'' said ABC President Tom Musser.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anyone that ABC supports in the future is going to have to have both feet
firmly on our side of the beliefs and principles that matter most to our
membership,'' said Musser, whose group represents 22,000 construction firms.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC gives Republicans more than $50 for every dollar it contributes to
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, House GOP leaders yanked from the schedule a vote this week on
the ABC's top legislative goal of the year, a bill that would permit small
businesses and labor groups to recover attorney's fees when they win cases
brought against them by the National Labor Relations Board and the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration and Democrats strongly opposed the bill, and the
loss of some pro-labor Republicans made passage unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some days you have to bring the bad news,'' Hastert, R-Ill., said at the
opening of a breakfast speech at the group's meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's one thing worse than pulling a bill, and that's putting a bill on
the floor and losing it,'' Hastert said. ``We're going to be there to fight
another day.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Hastert was interrupted by Michael Uremovich, who said he does
construction work in Hastert's northern Illinois district. He complained that
his company had spent $250,000 to defend itself against what he called a
``frivolous'' NLRB claim.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel like we've been let down,'' he said to applause from his
colleagues. ``Let's get the bill on the floor and find out who's on our side and
who's not.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another delegate from Kansas urged all the builders to head for House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay's office after the breakfast to express their
dissatisfaction. DeLay, R-Texas, was supposed to address the breakfast but
canceled, citing scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
	   Musser met with DeLay later Wednesday and repeated the group's determination
to see a vote on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABC, during this election cycle, has given some $245,000 to House
Republicans and $5,000 to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics, which monitors campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Makinson, executive director of that center, said ABC's decision to be
more vigilant about who it gives money to might be ``a reaction to the heavy
hand that is being laid on potential donors this year. It might be donor
fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
	   It also goes to the heart of why interest groups give money to politicians,
he said: ``They don't give money for democracy, they give money to get
results.''
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., recently advised business groups
in general to channel their money to lawmakers -- mainly Republicans -- who
support their agendas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't try to buy into lawmakers who are going to hammer you every time,''
Lott said in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no doubt that they need to be more careful about people who don't
support their agenda,'' Hastert's spokesman, John Feehery, said of the ABC
reaction to the withdrawal of their bill. But Feehery added that if people want
to see their legislation passed, ``the bigger message is that you need a bigger
Republican majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation was opposed by the AFL-CIO as an anti-worker attempt to
discourage the NLRB and the Labor Department from pursuing cases that they
aren't sure of winning.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Georgine, president of the AFL-CIO's building and construction trade
department, said in a statement before the decision to pull the bill that the
labor organization also welcomed a vote because ``we'll be using it to determine
who supports working families and who doesn't.''

$2,500 for the performance and banquet afterwards with the artists at the opera
house.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Releases Heating Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today ordered the release of the
remainder of federal heating assistance money to help families in the Northeast
hit hard by this year's cold weather and the soaring cost of home heating oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he ordered the release of $125 million from the Low Income Home
Energy Assistance Program to help families who must rely on oil to heat their
homes. He said that amount was all that is left in the fund this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also said he would seek $600 million in emergency funds for
the program in his supplemental budget request, so that there will be money to
help others during the hot summer months.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans have always pulled together to help their fellow citizens in
time of need,'' Clinton said. ``Now the families of the Northeast need our help
too, and we must act.''
</P>
<P>
	   The government already has provided $200 million in LIHEAP funding in an
effort to offset the rising cost of heating oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson met in Boston with leaders of
industry and consumer groups about fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue has emerged in the Senate race between first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and her likely Republican rival, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
Giuliani has urged Clinton to address the problem by releasing oil from the U.S.
strategic petroleum reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the LIHEAP funds released today would be targeted toward the
hardest-hit states, and he would meet soon with governors and members of
Congress from those states.
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke during his first full-fledged news conference this year.
He repeated his legislative priorities for the year, his last one in office, and
appealed to Congress to devote more than half of the non-Social Security surplus
to Medicare and a prescription drug program for seniors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask them to move quickly, and resist the temptation to spend large
portions of the surplus,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how he felt about being used as a political punching bag by the GOP
presidential candidates, Clinton offered tongue-in-cheek sympathy for Sen. John
McCain of Arizona and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said twin hallmarks of his presidency -- the booming economy and
lower crime rates -- have left the Republicans struggling for campaign issues.
``They've got a tough job and I've got a lot of sympathy for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also highlighted a new study by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development that showed public housing residents are more than twice as likely
to be victims of gun violence than other Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They deserve to be as safe as the rest of us,'' Clinton said. He cited the
recent shooting deaths of four high school students -- two in Washington, D.C.,
and two in Littleton, Colo. -- and again urged Congress to approve his gun
safety proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Guns in the wrong hands continue to claim too many young lives,'' Clinton
said.

<HEADLINE> Borders Eyes Puerto Rico Stores  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS HAWLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Behind a plasterboard divider in a Puerto
Rican mall, the air crackles with the noise of electric saws, the raspy sounds
of shipping cartons ripped open and talk of a bold new experiment in
globalization.
</P>
<P>
	   Borders Group Inc., the $2.6 billion American bookstore chain, has chosen
this Spanish-speaking U.S. Caribbean island for its first "bilingual" superstore
-- and local competitors are watching in trepidation.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is going to be something entirely new here," general manager Julio
Reyes enthused as he rushed around bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
	   In its cavernous two-story space in San Juan's Plaza las Americas, Borders
is building the prototype for a planned push into Latin America. It's a breath
of fresh air for Puerto Rico's readers of English, who in the absence of chain
bookstores have made do with woefully inferior selections.
</P>
<P>
	   "The problem with the bookstores here is they're small and they don't cater
to everyone," said Edwin Molina Atehortua, a 26-year-old computer engineer. "I
usually buy all my books online, because you can't find them here."
</P>
<P>
	   But the idea is unsettling for many Puerto Ricans who fear their culture
might be further eroded.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps the biggest critics are the rattled rivals and the distributors who
say they are frustrated by Borders' demands for deep discounts.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are going to change the market dramatically here, but they've also got
a lot to learn," said Jorge Merino, president of the Puerto Rican Book Chamber
that includes publishers, bookstores and wholesalers. "I think they were sold on
the idea that to get to San Juan you drive just a little bit past Miami and it's
there on your right!"
</P>
<P>
	   When the store opens Saturday only 20 percent of its 110,000 titles will be
in Spanish. Yet despite more than a century of U.S. rule, 75 percent of the 4
million people here say they don't speak English or speak it "with difficulty,"
according to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   Reyes said he hoped the Spanish titles would increase to 40 percent within a
year. Competitors say that's still too low and note English-language books
account for only 20 percent of their sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, it's a conceptual leap for Borders Group of Ann Arbor, Mich. The
chain with 300 Borders stores, 900 Waldenbooks stores, 25 Books Etc. outlets and
Internet vendor Borders.com is the second-biggest U.S. bookseller after Barnes &AMP;
Noble Inc. Borders has branches in Australia, New Zealand and Britain, and an
English-language store in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes &AMP; Nobles, which has Spanish-language sections in nearly 200 of its
U.S. stores, has no plans for opening stores outside the United States,
spokeswoman Debra Williams said Wednesday. Amazon.com ships books to 150
countries but does not have a Spanish-language Web site or distribution centers,
said spokesman Paul Capelli.
</P>
<P>
	   While courteous in courting customers -- its stores have comfortable chairs,
children's sections stacked with toys, and cafes -- Borders has a reputation for
driving a hard bargain with suppliers and being a tough competitor.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal antitrust lawsuit against Borders and Barnes &AMP; Noble by the
American Booksellers Association is scheduled for trial next year in San
Francisco, alleging an attempt to run independent bookstores out of business by
illegally arranging favorable terms from publishers. The association's
membership has dropped from 5,200 in 1991 to 3,200.
</P>
<P>
	   Borders and Barnes &AMP; Noble deny wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Puerto Rican distributors and publishers complain Borders is demanding 50
percent discounts and six months to return unsold books. Local bookstores get no
more than 35 percent, and the standard for returns is 30 days.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone would love to be selling to Borders, but they're asking too much,"
said salesman Reinaldo Ocasio of Ediciones Nuevos Horizontes.
</P>

	   Distributors say that's why Borders has so few Spanish titles. Reyes,
Borders' manager, said distributors have had trouble filling his shelves.
</P>
<P>
	   Puerto Rican authors, however, may be big winners. Borders plans to buy
books here for its other stores, hiring two local buyers, including published
poet Mairim Cruz Bernal. It promises to organize book-signing tours for Puerto

	   Some chafe at the invasion by another U.S. giant. Walgreens long ago
captured the pharmacy market from the homegrown El Amal chain. K-Mart and Sam's

said as she shopped in Thekes Bookstore.
</P>
<P>
	   Local booksellers concede they'll lose customers.
</P>
<P>
	   At Norberto Gonzalez Books, which shares a single block with three other
bookstores in the shadow of the University of Puerto Rico, there are no chairs,
the aisles are barely wide enough for one person and few shoppers stayed to
browse after picking up their orders.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bookstores here are just different," said Gonzalez, whose store bears his
name. "Without question, Borders is going to affect us. It might even put some
bookstores out of business."

<HEADLINE> Tester Criticizes Navy Testing  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy is opposing spending $47 million on a shock
survival test of its new Seawolf attack submarine ``at the peril of the ship and
its crew,'' the Pentagon's top weapons tester says.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report to Defense Secretary William Cohen and to Congress, Philip
Coyle, the director of operational testing and evaluation, said his office has
repeatedly appealed the Navy's decision to forego the test.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The omission of the (test) places Seawolf's ... combat survivability in
question,'' Coyle wrote in the report Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy has built two Seawolf-class submarines. The third and final one,
the USS Jimmy Carter, is under construction. The three subs, originally
conceived during the Cold War, cost an average of $2.8 billion each.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy normally puts the first of a new class of ships through a series of
tests subjecting it to live underwater explosions meant to simulate a depth
charge or sea mine detonation which it might encounter in combat. In the
Seawolf's case, the test was scrapped because the original 30-sub program was
scaled back to just three.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To test the hull integrity for $47 million is not money well spent,'' Navy
spokesman Cmdr. Greg Smith said. If the full compliment of 30 Seawolf subs were
being built the test would be worthwhile, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   In his report, Coyle wrote that ship shock tests often reveal serious but
correctable design flaws that go undetected in modeling and simulation. He noted
that the Navy had done underwater shock tests of individual components on the
Seawolf, such as hatches and weapons launching systems, but not of the full
ship.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The final dilemma facing Seawolf is that while the full ship shock test is
the centerpiece of the ship's ... shock and survivability qualification, the
Navy currently has not made the programmatic or financial commitment to make it
happen, at the period of the ship and its crew,'' Coyle wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Coyle said Congress appropriated funds for the test in the fiscal 1996
budget, but the Navy used that money to help pay for the correction of
unforeseen problems related to the submarine's sonar. After the Navy set aside
money in its 1999 budget to prepare to do the test in 2000, Congress removed the
funding. The Navy has since deleted all funding for the shock test from its
long-term budget plan.

	   Ex-Bank of NY Exec Pleads Guilty
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Bank of New York executive and her
husband pleaded guilty today to money laundering charges, admitting
they accepted $1.8 million to arrange a tax-evasion scheme
involving the illegal transfer of as much as $10 billion from
Russia. The former executive, Lucy Edwards, and her husband, Peter
Berlin, entered their pleas in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
The couple admitted allowing Russian bankers to set up unlicensed
banking operations in New York's borough of Queens and in Jersey
City, N.J., so the Russians could illegally move large amounts of
money through accounts at the Bank of New York to evade taxes in
both Russia and the United States. A spokesman for the Bank of New

<HEADLINE> Clinton Releases Heating Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today ordered the release of the
remainder of federal heating assistance money to help families in the Northeast
hit hard by this year's cold weather and the soaring cost of home heating oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he ordered the release of $125 million from the Low Income Home
Energy Assistance Program to help families who must rely on oil to heat their
homes. He said that amount was all that is left in the fund this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also said he would seek $600 million in emergency funds for
the program in his supplemental budget request, so that there will be money to
help others during the hot summer months.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans have always pulled together to help their fellow citizens in
time of need,'' Clinton said. ``Now the families of the Northeast need our help
too, and we must act.''
</P>
<P>
	   The government already has provided $200 million in LIHEAP funding in an
effort to offset the rising cost of heating oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson met in Boston with leaders of
industry and consumer groups about fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue has emerged in the Senate race between first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and her likely Republican rival, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
Giuliani has urged Clinton to address the problem by releasing oil from the U.S.
strategic petroleum reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the LIHEAP funds released today would be targeted toward the
hardest-hit states, and he would meet soon with governors and members of
Congress from those states.
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke during his first full-fledged news conference this year.
He repeated his legislative priorities for the year, his last one in office, and
appealed to Congress to devote more than half of the non-Social Security surplus
to Medicare and a prescription drug program for seniors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask them to move quickly, and resist the temptation to spend large
portions of the surplus,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how he felt about being used as a political punching bag by the GOP
presidential candidates, Clinton offered tongue-in-cheek sympathy for Sen. John
McCain of Arizona and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said twin hallmarks of his presidency -- the booming economy and
lower crime rates -- have left the Republicans struggling for campaign issues.
``They've got a tough job and I've got a lot of sympathy for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also highlighted a new study by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development that showed public housing residents are more than twice as likely
to be victims of gun violence than other Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They deserve to be as safe as the rest of us,'' Clinton said. He cited the
recent shooting deaths of four high school students -- two in Washington, D.C.,
and two in Littleton, Colo. -- and again urged Congress to approve his gun
safety proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Guns in the wrong hands continue to claim too many young lives,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president dismissed arguments for shortening the waiting period for
handgun purchases at gun shows. He said he wants a compromise with Congress that
would accommodate such concerns and ``have a bill that keeps people alive.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has not been a huge amount of inconvenience in the waiting period,''
Clinton said. ``There has got to be a solution here that deals with that. Maybe
they can hawk the guns at the local police department.''
</P>
<P>
	   He pledged he would not sign gun legislation ``that promises the American
people this will make them safer, (if) it does not do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   On foreign policy, Clinton said he has not ruled out a stop in Pakistan
during his visit to India and Bangladesh next month. He said he would base his
decision ``on what would best serve our long-term interests.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan's military ruler urged Clinton earlier this month not to bypass his
country, saying a visit would go a long way toward easing tensions with India
and resolving their long-standing conflict over the Kashmir region.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he is open to helping mediate a solution to the Kashmir
dispute. ``Absolutely. I would. Why? For the same reason that we've been
involved in Northern Ireland and the Middle East,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he believes that, if India and Pakistan could work out their
differences, ``the Indian subcontinent might very well be the great success
story of the next 50 years.''

	   A new survey by human relations consulting firm William M. Mercer,

at or below average.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, a salary that averages $60,000 nationally would be worth 17.4

</P>
<P>
	   The survey, which studied more than 200 U.S. cities, found the higher a
salary is, the less likely it is to be influenced by locale. A $60,000 salary
would average 12 percent more in Los Angeles ($67,200), while a $90,000 income
would only rise 8.1 percent to $97,290.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in volatile trading today as a pair of
strong corporate profit reports helped technology stocks edge back from a recent
slump but blue chips fell.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 105.18 at 10,612.91.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 9.76 at 1,392.29, and the high-tech dominated Nasdaq composite index was up
40.32 at 4,461.09.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Applied Materials rose 8 1/2 to 175 after announcing
stronger-than-expected profits and a robust outlook for the coming year. The
company, a leading maker of chip-manufacturing equipment, earned $328.5 million,
or 80 cents per share, in its most recent quarter. Analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 77 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Applied Materials also announced it will split its stock two shares for one
effective March 15.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader semiconductor sector rose on Applied Materials' report of strong
customer demand. LSI Logic rose 5 3/4 to 104 and Texas Instuments rose 1 15/16
to 136 15/16.

company said late Tuesday it earned 3 cents per share in its fiscal second
quarter, beating analysts' estimates of 1 cent per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, investors' favorites for the past several months, have
struggled in the past three sessions as traders sold shares to collect profits.
Today, they edged back at the expense of blue-chips like Coca-Cola, down 2 1/8
at 53 3/4, and Procter &AMP; Gamble, down 1 5/8 at 94 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors remained on edge over concerns that the rapid growth of the
U.S. economy will persuade the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest
rates to raise the cost of borrowing money and force a slowdown. The Fed, which
has raised rates four times since last June, fears the booming economy will
eventually spark a rise in inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The U.S. economy doesn't seem to be slowing down at all," said Alan
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. "Stocks
continue to climb a wall of worry over higher interest rates."
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest-rate
fluctuations, were mostly lower today. American Express fell 5 3/4 to 153 3/8
and PaineWebber fell 1 5/16 to 36 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan will address the House Banking
Committee in his semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. Analysts said investors
will listen carefully to his testimony on the state of the economy, seeking
clues to the Fed's sentiment.
</P>
<P>
	   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancers by a
7-to-5 margin. NYSE volume came to 809.69 million shares, compared with 849.54
at the same time Tuesday. The modest volume belied some major volatility in the
market. Friday is a double-witching day, when stock and index options expire,
forcing traders to adjust their portfolios. These quarterly deadlines tend to
increase volume and volatility.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Urges Big Iran Vote Turnout  </HEADLINE>
   By VIJAY JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Calling this week's parliamentary elections the ``most
significant'' in 21 years, pro-reform President Mohammad Khatami on Wednesday
urged Iranians to strengthen his hand by voting in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   On the last day of campaigning before Friday's vote, top liberal candidates
who support Khatami predicted they will win a majority in the 290-seat
parliament, or Majlis, which is now dominated by conservative lawmakers backed
by the hard-line clergy.
</P>
<P>
	   There are no opinion polls in Iran. But reformists are banking on ordinary
Iranians' frustration with the strict Islamic rules imposed by the clergy, who
came to power in the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Iranians gave Khatami a landslide victory in 1997, drawn by his promise of
reforms. In a radio and television speech, the president said the people can
show their will again.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami did not refer directly to his reform programs, but to his supporters
the message was clear.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By these votes you can give the most help to the president,'' he said.
``This election will be the 21st election since the revolution and, God willing,
it would be the most significant one.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the streets of Tehran, dozens of young people interviewed said they
supported pro-reform candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important issue for me is my freedom. How do I define freedom? I
should be able to say what I want, do what I want,'' said Farangeez Haqiqat.
</P>
<P>
	   Her friend, Narges Teimouri, nodded. The cuffs of a pink sweater and the
tapered end of blue jeans peeked out from under her black chador, which most
Iranian women wear to cover themselves in obedience to Iranian laws.
</P>
<P>
	   In a basketball stadium in downtown Tehran, reformist candidates addressed a
rally where about 5,000 supporters waved banners, whistled, sang patriotic songs
and cheered every time the name of a jailed dissident was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
	   Men and women sat on opposite stands but clapped and shouted in unison. Many
in the audience, including women, had wrapped campaign pamphlets around their
foreheads like crowns.
</P>
<P>
	   The election results will prove ``that someone may rule as a jailer but he
cannot lock the hearts of the people,'' said Alireza Nouri, a Tehran candidate
whose brother, former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, is in jail for religious
dissent.
</P>
<P>
	   Others who addressed the rally included Mohammadreza Khatami, the
president's brother, and Hadi Khamenei, the reformist brother of supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a hard-liner.
</P>
<P>
	   During the last 2 1/2 years, Khatami has tried to ease the Islam-inspired
social and political restrictions imposed by the clerics. The press has become
freer, people have begun to question the clergy and women have often flouted the
strict dress codes.
</P>
<P>
	   Reformist candidates also have tested the limits of what was permissible:
One campaign leaflet showed a picture of candidate Mehdi Zad Bahtoui wearing a
necktie, which is considered un-Islamic. Another showed candidate Hossein
Farrokhi with an endorsement from movie actress Mahaya Petrossian, whose picture
appeared on the reverse side. The use of an actress would have been unthinkable
in previous election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's elections will break ground in other ways. A record 424 women are
candidates, and for the first time, only people with college degrees are being
allowed to run.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the reformists face an uphill task.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if they win a majority in the Majlis, they could be blocked. The Majlis
has no legal weight without the hard-line controlled Guardian Council, which
must endorse all legislation. Even then, Khamenei has the final word.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-liners also have overpowering control of the judiciary, the
electronic media and the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Two senior hard-line clerics, Nouri Hamedani and Mohammed Fazel Lankarani,
urged voters to support the ideals of Islam. People should elect candidates who
``do not seek to undermine or weaken Islamic teachings,'' Lankarani said.

<HEADLINE> Drug Cos. Post Higher Profits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Operating profits increased last year for both Glaxo Wellcome
and SmithKline Beecham, the companies said Wednesday as they prepared to combine
to create the world's largest pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline Beecham showed the faster growth of the pair, its 1999 earnings
increasing by 13 percent. Glaxo Wellcome's annual earnings grew by 6 percent,
before a special charge to pay for restructuring costs reduced annual earnings
by 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're pretty much in line with our expectations," SG Securities analyst
Michael King said of the results.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies announced their annual results for the last time as individual
firms. London-based Glaxo agreed last month to buy SmithKline, which has
headquarters in London and Philadelphia, in a deal valued at $182.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined business, to be called Glaxo SmithKline, would have a 7.3
percent share of the global pharmaceutical market.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of Glaxo's antiviral drugs surged by 19 percent last year, accounting
for almost half of its $13.75 billion in annual sales, the company said. Two new
treatments for HIV, together with flu drug Relenza and the hepatitis B medicine
Zeffix, helped propel growth in this category.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of respiratory medicines increased by 11 percent, with the company's
best-seller, asthma drug Flixotide, generating sales of $1 billion. Drugs for
central nervous system ailments posted a 5 percent rise in sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Total annual sales were up 5 percent, at constant exchange rates, from the
previous year's level of $13.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo provides results by the half-year instead of by the quarter. Sales
accelerated 7 percent from the first half of the year to $7.10 billion in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's annual operating profit increased by 4 percent before inclusion of a
one-time restructuring charge of $319 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The one-time charge resulted in a 2 percent decrease in operating profit to
$4.25 billion, and a 1 percent drop in earnings to $2.93 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Second-half operating profit, adjusted to exclude the charge, rose by 6
percent over the first half of the year to $2.35 billion. Adjusted second-half
earnings increased by 9 percent to $1.65 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo did not report fourth-quarter results. British law does not require
companies to release profit and sales figures on a quarterly basis.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline reported a 13 percent increase in earnings for the year, buoyed
by strong sales in its prescription and over-the-counter medication sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug maker earned $603 million in the fourth quarter or 56 cents per
U.S. share, compared with $557 million or 51 cents per U.S. share in the
comparable quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter sales, at constant exchange rates, fell 2 percent to $3.65
billion from $3.84 billion. The drop resulted from the sale of several
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year 1999, SmithKline earned $2.3 billion, compared with $2.08
billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Annual sales were up 3 percent to $13.58 billion from $13.42 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmaceutical sales grew 12 percent in 1999, fed by the continued strength
of the antidepressant Paxil and the antibiotic Augmentin.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer health care sales rose 6 percent for the year. SmithKline makes
Nicorette gum and NicoDerm CQ, a patch designed to help smokers quit.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. shares of SmithKline fell $2.50 to $53.37 1/2 in afternoon trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Limits Breast Cancer Coverage  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Patient groups and doctors are praising a decision by Aetna
Inc., the nation's largest health insurer, to stop paying for most bone marrow
transplants for breast cancer patients following the discrediting of a pivotal
study.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Aetna is doing the right thing," Fran Visco, president of the
National Breast Cancer Coalition, said Wednesday. "Bone marrow transplant is not
quality health care for women with breast cancer."
</P>
<P>
	   Such praise is rare from health care advocates, who usually criticize
insurers when they cut benefits, accusing them of scrimping to boost profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna said it will only pay for the physically grueling and expensive
therapy for women participating in federally sponsored studies. It will continue
to pay for bone marrow transplants for other illnesses such as leukemia, in
which studies have proven its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna's decision comes just two weeks after it was disclosed that a South
African study of the treatment-- which had given hope to some women with
advanced breast cancer -- contained falsified data.
</P>
<P>
	   The South African study was the only one of five long-awaited studies that
initially found the treatment helped prolong survival rates. The four other
studies released in April 1999 found no difference in survival for breast cancer
patients who underwent the bone marrow transplant therapy than those who tried
less risky treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   "At this point in time there is no credible evidence that this approach is
likely to be better than a more conventional approach," said Dr. Arthur
Leibowitz, chief medical officer for Aetna U.S. Healthcare. "We now have five
well controlled studies that show this thing doesn't work."
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna was praised for continuing coverage of the treatment for members in
medical studies, as well as deciding to stop paying for the therapy for women
not participating in studies.
</P>
<P>
	   "This appears to be a reasonable decision given the lack of evidence that
bone marrow transplant is a benefit," said Dr. Harmon Eyre, chief medical
officer of the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the South African study was found to be flawed on Feb. 4, the
findings of the four other studies prompted top cancer specialists to conclude
that, at least for women with advanced breast cancer, a bone marrow transplant
was not a good option.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Breast Cancer Coalition had also advised that women who aren't
participating in medical research testing should not try bone transplant
therapy. Studies on the therapy are continuing to find out if certain types of
breast cancer patients can benefit from the therapy.
</P>
<P>
	   In the controversial treatment, women receive ultrahigh doses of
chemotherapy followed by a bone marrow transplant. Thousands of women have
demanded the procedure, believing it is their last best hope.
</P>
<P>
	   Bone marrow transplants usually cost at least $100,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Insurers initially balked at covering the treatment in the late 1980s, but
eventually most paid for it after pressed by lawsuits and fears about a public
relations backlash.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Aetna paid for 336 bone marrow transplants, about half of them
for breast cancer patients, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
	   United Healthcare, the nation's second largest health insurer, said
Wednesday that it will continue to leave the decision on bone marrow transplant
coverage to its doctors. United allows its patients to get the therapy at
certain hospitals, if doctors at those institutions believe it is proper.
</P>
<P>
	   "We still think this is a patient-physician decision," said Dr. Lee
Newcomer, United's senior vice president for health policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the studies came out last spring, United has seen a big decline in
patients seeking the treatment, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most women are now seeing that the risk of the treatment is not the worth
it," Newcomer said.

<HEADLINE> Talks Fail To Dent Belfast Deadlock  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The British and Irish governments, seeking to extricate
Northern Ireland's peace process from a deepening crisis, failed Wednesday to
narrow the divisions between key parties in the province's suspended
Protestant-Catholic administration.
</P>
<P>
	   As they departed British Prime Minister Tony Blair's London residence, the
rival leaders of the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Fein traded angry
accusations over Britain's decision last week to strip authority from the
Belfast power-sharing Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've come such a long way, I simply cannot believe that we are going to
let this chance slip away,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Ireland's four-party coalition took shape just two months ago in
fulfillment of the 2-year-old Good Friday peace accord. After Wednesday's
deadlocked talks, it looked unlikely to return to power soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein, which is linked to the Irish Republican Army, emphasized the IRA
would make no disarmament commitments, as the governments demand, until Sinn
Fein regained its two posts within the 12-member Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At the moment, the Good Friday agreement is lying in a wastepaper bin. The
British government needs to get it back out, put it back together again and get
serious about the process of conflict resolution,'' said Sinn Fein's Martin
McGuinness, a former IRA commander who was the Cabinet's minister for education
until Britain resumed direct control Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ulster Unionist chief David Trimble, the Protestant who agreed to form
the administration in expectation that the IRA would disarm in response, said
his supporters wouldn't stomach resumed power-sharing with Sinn Fein until the
IRA made a firm commitment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Good Friday accord anticipated the IRA's total disarmament, along with
that of pro-British paramilitary groups, by May.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA, which is 31 months into a cease-fire, has never promised it would
gradually scrap its stockpiled weapons in cooperation with the province's
independent disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
	   And the IRA retaliated Tuesday for Britain's resumption of direct rule by
breaking off talks with the commission and withdrawing a vague proposal hinting
at the outlawed group's eventual disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   But Trimble emphasized the IRA's withdrawn plan -- which suggested the
group's hidden arsenal could be ``placed beyond use'' following unspecified
political progress -- was nowhere near what Ulster Unionists required.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not interested in cobbling together formulae of words which allow
the process to stagger on for another week or two,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble insisted the IRA should have begun identifying the location of its
weapons dumps in January as part of the compromise deal negotiated by American
diplomat George Mitchell last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We did all that we could do to make the agreement work,'' he said, adding
of Sinn Fein and the IRA: ``The ball remains firmly in their court.''
</P>
<P>
	   John Hume, the pacifist Catholic politician who shared the 1998 Nobel Peace
Prize with Trimble, refused to be drawn publicly into the bickering.
</P>
<P>
	   Hume, who leads Sinn Fein's larger rival for Catholic votes, the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, maintained that all three parties remained committed
to making the Cabinet work again soon.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that during their 10 fleeting weeks in government, ``we worked very
well together and improved the atmosphere on our streets immeasurably.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Push Seniors' Concerns  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats are tripping over each other to
pass a law before the November elections to let working people over age 65 keep
all their Social Security payments. But Congress is still sharply divided on
another concern of the elderly: Medicare prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the outcome, the high priority both sides have placed on elderly
issues reflect the importance of older voters in determining whether Republicans
keep their slim hold on the House in this year's congressional election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The senior vote is the battleground for who gets control of the House,''
said Dan Maffei, spokesman for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The odds appear long that Congress will make progress on the biggest of
these issues: ensuring the long-term financial solvency of Medicare and Social
Security and giving people new options to invest for retirement. So lawmakers
are focusing on lesser steps that would demonstrate some accomplishment for
voters or provide a campaign issue if compromise isn't possible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody knows somebody who can't afford prescription drugs,'' said Rep.
Ronnie Shows, D-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   After languishing for years, bipartisan legislation ending the Social
Security earnings limit is on the fast track in the House, and President Clinton
is promising to sign it into law. The bill would scrap a Depression-era law that
takes away $1 in benefits for every $3 a person age 65-69 earns over $17,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
	   One reason that elimination of the earnings has never been never passed
before is that sponsors of broader Social Security reform wanted to use it as a
``sweetener'' to attract more support for that effort. Now, the bill is expected
to reach the House floor in March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At least we are moving some Social Security reform forward,'' said Rep. E.
Clay Shaw, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   But some lawmakers question this approach -- similar to what House GOP
leaders are doing with a series of tax cuts -- of moving only one popular item
through Congress instead of tackling the larger problem head-on.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It essentially represents an 'eat-dessert-first' approach to reform,''
said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, who nonetheless supports the bill. ``Congress
should be grappling with the tough choices of how to extend Social Security
solvency.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the Social Security earnings limit bill has a good chance of becoming
law, Republicans and Democrats seem less likely to settle on a Medicare
prescription drug benefit. Republicans believe Democrats will oppose any
compromise, preferring to use costly prescription drugs as a potent political
issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said Wednesday that the ``health of
Americans is more important than politics'' and accused GOP leaders of using the
election as an excuse for no action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Instead of just looking toward our own campaigns, we need a campaign for
seniors' health care,'' the Missouri Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic leaders on Wednesday began trying to force House consideration of
two bills intended to lower the costs of prescription drugs through group
purchasing power and to add an outpatient drug benefit for the 39 million people
who now receive Medicare. Democrats would have to get 218 signatures on
petitions to get the bills to the House floor.
</P>
<P>
	   But the bills are opposed by some Democrats and most Republicans, as well as
by a coalition led by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
-- the lobbying group responsible for the TV ad campaign featuring ``Flo,'' the
bowler who urges a bipartisan solution. Critics say the Democratic bills amount
to government-imposed price controls and a costly burden on the
already-faltering Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has asked the Commerce and Ways and
Means committees to work on a solution, but the GOP is divided on whether to
hold out for broader Medicare reform or concentrate on the prescription drug
issue alone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're working on it. We haven't made that decision yet,'' Hastert said in
an interview. ``We want to find the best way to do it. I'd prefer that we have a
bipartisan effort.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans say any prescription drug measure should avoid putting Medicare
in further financial jeopardy, be targeted to help the neediest senior citizens
and avoid putting government in charge. But Democrats say such restrictions
could make the bill meaningless.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be so focused, and so surgical, that it doesn't help many people
at all,'' Gephardt said. --------
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE -- The Medicare bills are H.R. 664 and H.R. 1495. The Social
Security earnings limit elimination bill is H.R. 5.

<HEADLINE> Anderson Files Lawsuit Against Iran  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright promised Wednesday
to help Americans held hostage for years in Lebanon find Iranian assets in the
United States that could be used to pay multimillion dollar judgments assessed
by U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's assurance came as the former State Department official in charge
of counter-terrorism during the 1980s kidnappings testified in federal court
that Iran ``with shrewdness and total ruthlessness'' orchestrated the kidnapping
of journalist Terry Anderson and other Westerners to put pressure on the Reagan
administration to sell it arms.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Oakley testified at a U.S. District Court hearing to determine the
size of the award Anderson -- the longest-held captive -- should receive. He
sued Iran for $100 million, and U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
found Iran in default on Tuesday because it failed to send any representatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright, at a congressional hearing, expressed caution against confiscation
of Iranian diplomatic property that might prompt retaliation against U.S. assets
overseas. She indicated officials have yet to determine exactly what they can do
but said she would work with hostages and their families on what actions can be
taken to collect on the judgments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are trying to be of assistance in terms of how to resolve these
(claims) and we're prepared to work with these families to identify unblocked
Iranian assets to help satisfy the judgments they have received,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson said Albright's comments could lead to a major victory in allowing
hostages and their families to collect judgments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The chances are pretty good we can work something out with the
administration,'' said Anderson, who has been meeting with administration
officials and members of Congress on behalf of the Beirut hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   Although held in Lebanon, Anderson and his fellow former hostages contend
their capture was orchestrated by Iran. Anderson, former chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, was held in Beirut for more than seven
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Three other hostages held with Anderson in Beirut in the 1980s -- David
Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio and Frank Reed -- earlier won a $65 million judgment
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Both that suit and Anderson's were filed under a 1996 law that lets
Americans subjected to terrorism in foreign countries sue in U.S. courts if the
State Department lists those nations as sponsors of terrorism. Iran has been on
the list since 1984. So far, no money has been collected under the 1996 law
because it lacks an enforcement mechanism.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Anderson suit, Oakley testified that Iran was behind the kidnappings.
``The whole picture is very, very clearly visible,'' from the vantage point of
more than a decade later.
</P>
<P>
	   Oakley, in charge of the State Department's counter-terrorism program at the
time, cited ``a direct link'' between Iran and the hostages in Beirut. And it
paid off for Iran in terms of covert arms it was sold by the Reagan
administration in exchange for hostage releases as part of the Iran-contra
affair, Oakley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran-sponsored terrorist groups were able to flourish in Beirut because
Lebanon at the time was torn by civil war and essentially had no government,
Oakley said.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS News anchor Dan Rather said he felt ``deep and abiding stunned
disbelief'' upon learning of Anderson's kidnapping. ``I don't know anyone in
journalism who wasn't in one way or another intimidated by it,'' Rather
testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson, the judge, asked Rather if CBS had ever considered arming its
correspondents and other personnel in war zones like Beirut in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Rather called such an approach ``a bad idea...No serious consideration was
ever given to that.''

<HEADLINE> Guyana Suspect Gets Hero's Funeral  </HEADLINE>
   By BERT WILKINSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) -- Guyana's most-wanted criminal suspect, killed in
a gunfight with police last week, was given a hero's funeral attended by
thousands of people Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Police surrounded a Georgetown apartment Feb. 8 in hopes of capturing Linden
London, 38, who was wanted on charges of murder and robbery. London fought back,
holding off as many as 300 police officers and soldiers in an 11-hour gunfight.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities set the building ablaze on the morning of Feb. 9 to flush London
out. When he fled, police shot and killed him.
</P>
<P>
	   London's death outraged some in Guyana who said that he was surrendering
when he was shot by police.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, about 10,000 people gathered for the open air ceremony at a
Georgetown square, where London's body, draped in the Guyanese flag, was on
display in a truck.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that the police were wrong in killing him. He had surrendered and
that is why I am out here,'' said Edith Jacobs, 62. ``That was murder.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police said London was carrying a bag that contained fragmentation grenades,
a submachine gun, two pistols, a smoke grenade, camouflage fatigues and hundreds
of rounds of ammunition. He was wearing a bulletproof vest.
</P>
<P>
	   London was wanted in more than 15 robberies over 10 years in this South
American country, including the robbery of a currency exchange in downtown
Georgetown in September.
</P>
<P>
	   During that robbery, an armed gang sprayed automatic gunfire down a crowded
street, wounding several people. The gang fled into a sugarcane field, which was
then set afire by police. One suspect was killed.

<HEADLINE> Both Parties Push Seniors' Concerns  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats are tripping over each other to
pass a law before the November elections to let working people over age 65 keep
all their Social Security payments. But Congress is still sharply divided on
another concern of the elderly: Medicare prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the outcome, the high priority both sides have placed on elderly
issues reflect the importance of older voters in determining whether Republicans
keep their slim hold on the House in this year's congressional election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The senior vote is the battleground for who gets control of the House,''
said Dan Maffei, spokesman for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The odds appear long that Congress will make progress on the biggest of
these issues: ensuring the long-term financial solvency of Medicare and Social
Security and giving people new options to invest for retirement. So lawmakers
are focusing on lesser steps that would demonstrate some accomplishment for
voters or provide a campaign issue if compromise isn't possible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody knows somebody who can't afford prescription drugs,'' said Rep.
Ronnie Shows, D-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   After languishing for years, bipartisan legislation ending the Social
Security earnings limit is on the fast track in the House, and President Clinton
is promising to sign it into law. The bill would scrap a Depression-era law that
takes away $1 in benefits for every $3 a person age 65-69 earns over $17,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
	   One reason that elimination of the earnings has never been never passed
before is that sponsors of broader Social Security reform wanted to use it as a
``sweetener'' to attract more support for that effort. Now, the bill is expected
to reach the House floor in March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At least we are moving some Social Security reform forward,'' said Rep. E.
Clay Shaw, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   But some lawmakers question this approach -- similar to what House GOP
leaders are doing with a series of tax cuts -- of moving only one popular item
through Congress instead of tackling the larger problem head-on.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It essentially represents an 'eat-dessert-first' approach to reform,''
said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, who nonetheless supports the bill. ``Congress
should be grappling with the tough choices of how to extend Social Security
solvency.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the Social Security earnings limit bill has a good chance of becoming
law, Republicans and Democrats seem less likely to settle on a Medicare
prescription drug benefit. Republicans believe Democrats will oppose any
compromise, preferring to use costly prescription drugs as a potent political
issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said Wednesday that the ``health of
Americans is more important than politics'' and accused GOP leaders of using the
election as an excuse for no action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Instead of just looking toward our own campaigns, we need a campaign for
seniors' health care,'' the Missouri Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic leaders on Wednesday began trying to force House consideration of
two bills intended to lower the costs of prescription drugs through group
purchasing power and to add an outpatient drug benefit for the 39 million people
who now receive Medicare. Democrats would have to get 218 signatures on
petitions to get the bills to the House floor.
</P>
<P>
	   But the bills are opposed by some Democrats and most Republicans, as well as
by a coalition led by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
-- the lobbying group responsible for the TV ad campaign featuring ``Flo,'' the
bowler who urges a bipartisan solution. Critics say the Democratic bills amount
to government-imposed price controls and a costly burden on the
already-faltering Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has asked the Commerce and Ways and
Means committees to work on a solution, but the GOP is divided on whether to
hold out for broader Medicare reform or concentrate on the prescription drug
issue alone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're working on it. We haven't made that decision yet,'' Hastert said in
an interview. ``We want to find the best way to do it. I'd prefer that we have a
bipartisan effort.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans say any prescription drug measure should avoid putting Medicare
in further financial jeopardy, be targeted to help the neediest senior citizens
and avoid putting government in charge. But Democrats say such restrictions
could make the bill meaningless.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be so focused, and so surgical, that it doesn't help many people
at all,'' Gephardt said. --------
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE -- The Medicare bills are H.R. 664 and H.R. 1495. The Social
Security earnings limit elimination bill is H.R. 5.

<HEADLINE> Nickelodeon Unveils New Series  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nickelodeon is striking a blow for diversity with three new
series with Hispanic leads, the kids' cable network announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Among its eight new series for the 2000-2001 season, Nick will launch
"Taina," a multi-generational series about a 14-year-old Hispanic girl in New
York City and another live-action show, "The Brothers Garcia," which revolves
around a Mexican-American family in San Antonio. Told from the perspective of
the youngest of four siblings, "Garcia" is described as an Hispanic "Wonder
Years."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, an interactive animated series called "Dora the Explorer" will
feature a 7-year-old Hispanic girl who lives inside a computer. In every
episode, she invites young viewers to participate in an adventure.
</P>
<P>
	   Nickelodeon executive vice president Cyma Zarghami called the
Hispanic-oriented new shows "a rounding out of our efforts to reflect the world
of kids." Nickelodeon is the top-rated basic cable channel in households and
among children.
</P>
<P>
	   Although no premiere dates were announced, the new series are expected to
roll out between this summer and early next year.
</P>
<P>
	   New series also include:
</P>
<P>
	   -- "Noah Knows Best," a live-action comedy about New Yorker Noah Beznick and
his sister Megan that focuses on sibling rivalry.
</P>
<P>
	   -- "Invader Zim," a cartoon series about an alien who spies on Earth by
masquerading as a kid and attending elementary school.
</P>
<P>
	   -- "As Told By Ginger," about a sixth-grade girl caught with one foot in
dorkiness and the other in the world of blooming popularity. It's from
Klasky-Csupo, creators of the network's popular "Rugrats," "The Wild
Thornberrys" and "Rocket Power."
</P>
<P>
	   -- "Chalk Zone," which follows the adventures of a boy who discovers a magic
piece of chalk that allows him to enter a world beyond the chalkboard.
</P>
<P>
	   -- "The Fairly Oddparents," which bestows upon 10-year-old Timmy two magical
helpmates: bumbling godparents.
</P>
<P>
	   Nickelodeon next season also will air some 150 new hours of 17 ongoing
series including "Blue's Clues," "Rugrats" and "SpongeBob SquarePants."

</P>
<P>
	   Hill became nationally known in 1991 during Senate confirmation hearings for
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, with whom Hill had worked at the
Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In
front of a large TV audience, Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment, nearly
toppling his nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time a professor of law at the University of Oklahoma, Hill is now on
the faculty of Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
	   Her first appearance is scheduled for Friday, when she joins host Catherine
Crier to comment on the ongoing Amadou Diallo shooting trial.
</P>
<P>
	   In subsequent appearances, Hill will share her thoughts on such issues as
the presidential campaign, sexual harassment and civil rights, the network said.
She is expected to be on the air two or three times per month.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Helps Small Businesses  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House passed legislation Wednesday that supporters
said would relieve small businesses of the oppressive threat of product
liability lawsuits. The Clinton administration promised a veto, saying the bill
would ``strand a large number of injured plaintiffs.''
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation, which passed 221-193, would cap punitive damages at
$250,000 or three times compensatory damages, whichever is less, in most civil
lawsuit against small businesses -- firms with fewer than 25 employees.
</P>
<P>
	   It also would exempt all retailers from legal responsibility for products
received from manufacturers and unaltered that later malfunction or cause
damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill still needs Senate consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   Frivolous lawsuits, said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., chief sponsor of the
bill, ``can ruin a small business overnight and crush the American dream for
those men and women who are driving our nation's economic expansion.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This bill will help protect small businesses from legal feeding frenzies
and restore some fairness to the justice system,'' said Dan Danner, senior vice
president of the National Federation of Independent Business.
</P>
<P>
	   Rogan cited a survey finding that one in five businesses do not expand
services or hire more people out of fear of unwarranted lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Since taking over the House in 1995, Republicans have made numerous attempts
to shield businesses from what they say are predatory or frivolous lawsuits. But
they have generally been thwarted by opposition from trial lawyer and consumer
groups and presidential vetoes.
</P>
<P>
	   Rogan said he hoped to win support this time with an ``incremental and
pragmatic'' approach that focused on small businesses, the firms most vulnerable
to expensive lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   But the administration, in a statement, said the bill had ``incredibly broad
scope'' that could bring sweeping changes to state liability laws.
</P>
<P>
	   It objected to provisions that exempt small businesses from joint and
several liability for non-economic damages such as pain and suffering. Under
joint and several liability, one defendant that has the financial resources can
be forced to pay all damages even if it is only partially responsible.
</P>
<P>
	   White House advisers would recommend the president veto the bill in its
current form, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats said the bill would alter or eliminate liability law in 41 states
for those who sell products which are defective and cause injury. ``This is a
serious move in the wrong direction,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., ranking
Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Conyers said the bill also was remiss in defining a small business only by
number of employees, not revenues. Some companies with fewer than 25 employees
do hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in business, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Conyers amendment that would have confined the bill to businesses making
less than $5 million annually and applying product liability protections to only
small business retailers was defeated, 237-178.
</P>
<P>
	   The House did accept an amendment permitting a court to exceed the $250,000
cap on punitive damages if there is clear evidence the defendant acted with
specific intent to cause harm. The cap on damages also does not apply when the
misconduct includes a violent crime, a hate crime, international terrorism,
civil rights violations or the destruction of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., also argued that the legislation would protect
some gunmakers, including the makers of the guns used in the Columbine high
school shootings, from lawsuits. Rogan said his bill would do nothing to stop a
claimant from seeking economic damages -- or non-economic damages if there is an
intentional wrong -- from a gun manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   EDITORS' NOTE -- The bill number is H.R. 2366.

<HEADLINE> McCain May Rewrite GOP Playbook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
</P>
<P>
	   NEWBERRY, S.C. (AP) -- With polar-opposite strategies in play, the
Republican presidential contest could have far-reaching implications: It's
George W. Bush and the establishment vs. John McCain's populist pitch to people
who don't normally vote in GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Arizona senator succeeds in Saturday's primary here and proceeds to
upset Bush in future contests, he will have rewritten his party's tactical
playbook to adapt to a changing political environment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to reconstitute (the GOP) governing coalition,'' McCain said in
Tuesday night's debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republican Party has lost its way. They have selected an establishment
candidate. I don't blame them for doing that. But they lost the last two
presidential elections,'' McCain said. And he said the party will lose again
``unless we open up this party ... unless we get independents, reconstitute the
old Reagan Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
	   After his own negative advertising hurt McCain's campaign in the first week
of the South Carolina contest, the Arizonan yanked the spots and disavowed
negative tactics. He has returned this week to appeals to Democrats and
independents, hoping they will cross party lines for the open primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, meanwhile, has found his footing after his shocking defeat in New
Hampshire and is running a traditional GOP campaign. He is catering to
conservatives while at the same time using TV ads and the news media to target
moderate Republicans and independents. He plans to overpower his rival with
money and organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet even as they profess confidence of victory, Bush's advisers acknowledge
the ground has shifted.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Carolina, said Bush strategist Ralph Reed, ``it's a dramatically
different place than when I first started working here'' in 1988. More retirees
have moved in along the coast. There are more high-tech suburban workers in the
Greenville-Spartanburg area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Grass-roots religious conservatives remain a very potent part of primary
elections, but like every other state in the South, this state is in the midst
of an economic and social transformation,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters other than traditional Republicans also are behind McCain's rise in
polls in upcoming primary states, such as Michigan, New York and California.
California Secretary of State Bill Jones withdrew his Bush endorsement to back
McCain on Wednesday, saying, ``Our goal is to have a party where we bring in
independents and Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
	   In events staged for TV news coverage, Bush pledged this week to improve
schools, campaign finance laws and health care -- all poll-tested favorites of
independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Advisers say the effort has cut into McCain's substantial lead among those
groups.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Bush and his allies are firing up social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   He visited Bob Jones University, a hotbed of South Carolina conservatism.
Some advisers urged him not to go, fearing the institution's segregationist
history would become a general election campaign issue -- along with other
recent efforts to tack to the right.
</P>
<P>
	   In radio ads and thousands of telephone calls automatically dialed to state
Republicans, the Texan has also questioned McCain's anti-abortion record.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign also welcomed outside interest groups, such as anti-abortion
and pro-tobacco lobbies, into the state for anti-McCain ad drives.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest example is a letter being mailed to thousands of Republicans by a
group trying to keep the Confederate flag atop the state Capitol building.
Though McCain's position is essentially the same as Bush's -- both say it's up
to state residents to decide whether the flag should be removed -- the letter
says, ``Only George Bush has refused to call the Confederate flag a racist
symbol.''
</P>
<P>
	   Polls suggest the onslaught has had an effect: McCain trails Bush by more
than 20 percentage points among Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizonan has fought back with TV ads espousing his anti-abortion views
and with Wednesday's endorsement by conservative former candidate Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
	   But some of the blunt-talking senator's comments have not helped his case
with conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   He accused anti-abortion groups of ``turning a cause into a business.'' And
he said Bob Jones University's ban on interracial dating was ``stupid, it's
idiotic and it's incredibly cruel.''
</P>
<P>
	   Thus, either by Bush's hand or his own, McCain is now dependent on a huge
turnout of nontraditional GOP primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   He is stirring their ranks with a promise to tell the truth, lead with a
steady hand and tip the political system on its head. McCain is billing himself
as the antidote to ``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``As president of the United States, I'll tell you the truth no matter
what,'' he says at every campaign stop and in his latest TV ad.
</P>
<P>
	   In his quest, McCain has broken new ground for message and tactics in a GOP
campaign. He said Bush's tax cut plan was too large, and pledged to use surplus
money to protect Social Security instead. Bush advisers said they mistakenly
relied on traditional GOP tactics in New Hampshire to argue that bigger tax cuts
are always better.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spent $500,000 less on TV ads than Bush in South Carolina and mocked
the state party establishment led by former Gov. Carroll Campbell.
</P>
<P>
	   And he courted the media, allowing almost unlimited access in the hopes that
he would get attention that his money couldn't buy.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show the race here a dead heat, with both camps in agreement that the
race will hinge on one question: Is this the right time and McCain the right
candidate for a stampede of new voters to the GOP primary?

<HEADLINE> IRS: $2B in 1996 Refunds Unclaimed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over $2 billion in unclaimed 1996 tax refunds is sitting
in government accounts, but it's still not too late for almost 1.6 million
taxpayers to get what they're owed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Internal Revenue Service warned Wednesday that these tardy taxpayers
have until April 15 of this year to file their late returns and still get a
refund. After that date, they still have to file a tax return but they won't get
their refund.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The law generally provides for refunds only if taxpayers file returns
within three years,'' said IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti. ``We want people
to get the refunds they deserve, but they have to file tax returns in order to
claim them.''
</P>
<P>
	   There are some catches: the IRS would hold any 1996 refund if taxpayers also
haven't filed returns for 1997 and 1998, and the amount could be reduced for any
amount of tax still owed for those years. There is no penalty for filing a late
tax return in which a refund is owed, since penalties are based on unpaid taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Taxpayers who are owed a 1996 refund also must ensure the return is received
by the IRS by April 15, not just postmarked by that date.

<HEADLINE> Mint: Sacagawea Coins Are Popular  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 200 million new Sacagawea dollar coins will be
in circulation by the end of February -- four times the annual demand for the
Susan B. Anthony dollar coin, the U.S. Mint said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mint has been aggressively marketing the new golden-colored dollar
coins, particularly mindful of the flop of the Anthony coins, which often were
mistaken for quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Initial public response to the Sacagawea coin, which debuted in late
January, is a ``grand slam home run,'' said U.S. Mint Director Philip Diehl.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of this, ``we have a backlog of orders we will be filling over the
next several weeks,'' Diehl said. To meet brisk demand, the Mint is doubling
production of the Sacagawea to 5 million a day, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diehl said the Mint has already shipped more than 60 million new dollar
coins to Federal Reserve Banks. That is ``equivalent to more than a year of bank
demand'' for the Anthony dollar coins, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mint's marketing campaign, however, has come under fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Some small banks felt snubbed by the Mint's decision to let Wal-Mart and
Sam's Clubs to begin making change with the coins on Jan. 30 and some lawmakers
also complained about the arrangement.

<HEADLINE> Naming Rights to New Ga. Mall Bought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DULUTH, Ga. (AP) -- Sugarloaf Mills, an outlet mall under construction in
suburban Atlanta, will be known as Discover Mills now that the credit card
company has paid for the right to name the mall.
</P>
<P>
	   Discover and the mall's developer, Mills Corp., said Wednesday the agreement
is the first in which a mall developer has sold naming rights, a common practice
for new sports arenas and entertainment venues.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Discover nor the Mills Corp., based in Arlington, Va., would
disclose the deal's price, though Discover spokeswoman Alicia Zatkowski called
$10 million "a good guess."
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement allows Riverwoods, Ill.-based Discover to place its logo and
marketing information throughout the mall and to give its customers special
promotions such as free coffee and enhanced "cash-back" offers. Discover also
will open a shop in the mall, which is about 25 miles northeast of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   The mall, the third in Gwinnett County, is expected to open in summer 2001.

<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybeans futures prices reversed early gains, settling down
in trading Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade on pressure from falling
soymeal prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans had risen in early trading amid reports China may have bought up to
500,000 tons of soybeans from the United States in the past week.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn futures prices closed higher, despite pressure from soybean futures and
reports that Russia canceled a 237,000-ton shipment of corn from the United
States. Wheat futures prices fell slightly, pressured partly by forecasts for
storms through the Plains states Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell  3/4 cent to $2.65 1/4 a bushel; March corn
rose  3/4 cent to $2.23 a bushel; May oats fell  1/4 cent to $1.15 a bushel; and
March soybeans fell 1 1/4 cents to $5.07 1/2 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Farmers Sue Cigarette Makers  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tobacco farmers sued cigarette makers Wednesday for $69
billion, contending they conspired to undo the federal system that regulates
tobacco prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The class-action case argues that the companies, led by Philip Morris Inc.,
misled farmers into helping them stop congressional legislation in 1998 that
would have given growers $28 billion. The companies later reached a settlement
with the states that will provide growers with much less -- $5.15 billion over
12 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit has 4,010 plaintiffs who grow tobacco or own federal tobacco
quotas, the licenses that a farmer must either own or rent to sell the crop.
There are about 500,000 farmers and quota holders nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we're asking for and all we've ever asked for ... is to be treated
fairly. We haven't been treated fairly," said Lamar DeLoach, a Metter, Ga.,
grower.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys general of 14 tobacco-growing states are listed as coconspirators
in the lawsuit along with a Philip Morris lobbyist because of their role in
getting the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit opens a new legal front for the manufacturers, who last week
were sued by a group of wholesalers who accused them of fixing prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies deny any wrongdoing in either case. Jay Poole, a spokesman for
Philip Morris, said the growers' lawsuit was a "direct assault" on the states'
settlement with the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some lawyer has convinced a group of farmers that there is a pot of gold at
the end of this litigation," Poole said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander Pires, the farmers' attorney, pledged to "break" the tobacco
companies "unless they pay their fair share" to the growers.
</P>
<P>
	   Pires, who sued McDonald's in the famous coffee-scalding case, won a
settlement last year in a racial discrimination case lawsuit against the
Agriculture Department that is expected to cost the government $1 billion. He
has a similar lawsuit pending against USDA on behalf of American Indian growers.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco farmers have seen their income decline sharply in recent years
because of declining consumption and increased imports of cheaper foreign leaf.
Since 1997, the amount of tobacco farmers are allowed to grow under the quota
system has been reduced by more than half. Small-scale farms that must rent
allotments have been especially hard hit.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA fixes the quotas each year based on the companies' purchasing
intentions, exports and existing tobacco stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The farmers who are suing the industry say the companies want to do away
with the quota system and contract directly with a select number of producers.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation that the growers helped the industry to defeat was intended
to settle state lawsuits against the companies and would have cost them $500
billion. The settlement they reached with the states will cost $206 billion. The
farmers say the companies made vague promises to "take care" of them if they
lobbied against the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Other farmers are opposed to the lawsuit, preferring to negotiate with the
companies instead.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't think it's time to give up yet," said Danny McKinney, chief
executive officer of the Burley Tobacco Grower's Cooperative in Lexington, Ky.
"You don't bite the hand that feeds you."
</P>
<P>
	   John Boyd, a Virginia grower, said the lawsuit could tie up states'
settlement and prevent farmers from getting their payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Imports of foreign tobacco, which is lower in quality than U.S. leaf, rose
sharply in the early 1990s because of the rise in popularity of discount
cigarettes, said USDA economist Tom Capehart. Less than 60 percent of the
tobacco in a cigarette is domestically grown.

<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- European stocks ended higher today, with gains in the food
and beverage and energy sectors leading the way.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of European companies closed up 4.82 points, or
1.3 percent, at 376.12. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies
in countries joining the single currency, rose 2.08 points to close at 432.29.
</P>

DJ Stoxx 50 Index ended 63.60 points higher at 4737.56.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the market ending higher, concerns remained about Thursday's
European Central Bank pending decision on interest rates and Friday's U.S.
consumer prices data, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   The energy sector index finished 5.0 percent higher, bolstered by strong
U.S. inventory data and positive comments from Saudi Arabia on current oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco, the largest company in the energy index in terms of market
capitalization, rose 36 pence, or 7.6 percent, to 510 pence. Royal Dutch

close at 479.25 pence.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong results from confectionery and soft drinks group Cadbury Schweppes
sparked off buying interest in the food and beverage sector, which rose 4.6
percent overall.
</P>
<P>
	   Cadbury, which closed up 21.5 pence, or 6.7 percent, at 342 pence, said its
full-year sales rose 5 percent to 4.3 billion pounds, from 4.1 billion pounds,
and its pretax profit was 958 million pounds, against 570 million pounds a year

6,147.4. The Paris CAC 40 index ended 0.8 percent lower to 6,046.27, while
Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 1.3 percent to 7,490.32 and Amsterdam's AEX

<HEADLINE> Clinton Releases Heating Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he is ``absolutely'' willing
to help mediate a solution to the decades-old dispute between India and Pakistan
over Kashmir. Still, he put off a decision on whether to visit Pakistan when he
travels to South Asia next month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Absolutely. I would,'' Clinton said when asked whether he would be willing
to step in as a mediator, as he has done in Northern Ireland and the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past 51 years, Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir,
the Himalayan state now divided between them and separated by a cease-fire line.
More than 15,000 people have been killed and thousands displaced by the
violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military ruler, urged Clinton earlier this
month not to bypass his country during his March trip, saying a visit would go a
long way toward easing tensions with India.
</P>
<P>
	   While willing to help mediate, Clinton believes it is up to India and
Pakistan to resolve the dispute. ``Unless we are asked by both parties to help,
we can't get involved,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   He will base his decision on whether to visit Pakistan, a new nuclear power,
on what will best serve U.S. interests in trying to stop ``a nuclear arms
race.''
</P>
<P>
	   On domestic matters, Clinton announced the release of $125 million from the
Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help families in the Northeast hit
hard by this year's cold weather and the soaring cost of home heating oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also said he would seek $600 million in emergency funds for
the program in his supplemental budget request to ensure there is money
available to help other people during the hot summer months. The government
already has provided $200 million in LIHEAP funds this winter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans have always pulled together to help their fellow citizens in
time of need,'' Clinton said. ``Now the families of the Northeast need our help
too, and we must act.''
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came on the same day Energy Secretary Bill Richardson met
in Boston with leaders of industry and consumer groups about fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue has emerged in the Senate race between first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and her likely Republican rival, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who
suggested Clinton could address the problem by releasing oil from the U.S.
strategic petroleum reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton left open that option: ``I have not ruled out any action which I
think is in the interest of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke during his first full-fledged news conference of 2000, a
session called so he could reiterate his legislative priorities for his final
year in office.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said it was brave of Illinois Gov. George Ryan to place a moratorium
on executions until he could learn why more sentences were overturned than
carried out. But the president said he is not sure similar action is needed for
at the federal level, as Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., as asked him to do.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People who support the death penalty, it seems to me, have an especially
heavy obligation to see that in cases where it is applied there is no question
of whether the guilt was there,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he is ``quite favorably disposed'' to legislation by Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., which provides for DNA testing of inmates who seek to prove they
did not commit the underlying crime for which they were condemned. ``Would I
sleep better at night if it were law? If it would really work, I would.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how he felt about being used as a political punching bag by the GOP
presidential candidates, Clinton offered tongue-in-cheek sympathy for Sen. John
McCain of Arizona and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said twin hallmarks of his presidency -- the booming economy and
lower crime rates -- have left the Republicans struggling for campaign issues.
``They've got a tough job and I've got a lot of sympathy for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also highlighted a new study by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development that showed public housing residents are more than twice as likely
to be victims of gun violence than other Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They deserve to be as safe as the rest of us,'' Clinton said. He cited the
recent shooting deaths of four high school students -- two in Washington, D.C.,
and two in Littleton, Colo. -- and again urged Congress to approve his gun
safety proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Guns in the wrong hands continue to claim too many young lives,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president dismissed arguments for shortening the waiting period for
handgun purchases at gun shows. He said he wants a compromise with Congress that
would accommodate such concerns and ``have a bill that keeps people alive.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has not been a huge amount of inconvenience in the waiting period,''
Clinton said. ``There has got to be a solution here that deals with that. Maybe
they can hawk the guns at the local police department.''
</P>
<P>
	   On a more personal matter, Clinton was asked whether he might surrender his
Arkansas law license rather than fight ethical complaints that could lead to his
disbarment. He settled the sexual harassment lawsuit brought by former Arkansas
state worker Paula Jones without admitting wrongdoing, but would not say whether
he might back away from this latest legal challenge in his home state.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he settled the Jones case ``because I thought that it was wrong
for the president to take an hour, much less a day, much less weeks away from
the job of the American people for anything that could be a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``In all things that have happened subsequently, I have left a lot of things
unsaid that might otherwise have been said, and I hope I can continue to do
that,'' he replied sternly.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arkansas Supreme Court has given Clinton 30 days to respond to two
ethics complaints seeking to strip him of his law license because of his conduct
in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

<HEADLINE> Iraqis Struggle Under Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON BARKHO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- For 12-year-old Ali Fadhil, Iraq's dire economic state
means making do with a piece of bread and a cup of tea for breakfast, and just
rice for dinner.
</P>
<P>
	   The government says citizens like Ali are suffering because of U.N. trade
sanctions, and because the United States stalls approval of humanitarian
shipments allowed under the oil-for-food program. U.S. officials counter that
the culprit is Baghdad, for not using hard currency from the deal to help its
people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You ask me hard questions,'' Ali told a reporter Wednesday when asked
about life in Baghdad. ``I can tell you without the food rations we get free
from the government, life could not go on.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two top U.N. officials who resigned in frustration this week blame both
sides for squeezing ordinary Iraqis in a political vise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do not think it is fair to make the civilian population subject to
bargaining ... (by) the government of Iraq on the one hand and the other in the
Security Council. The real victims are those who walk the streets of Baghdad,
Basra and Mosul,'' said Hans von Sponeck, a German who resigned Sunday as the
top U.N. official in charge of humanitarian relief in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. World Food Program chief Jutta Burghardt resigned Tuesday, saying she
fully supported von Sponeck. Burghardt, also a German, said the suffering of
civilians is bound to continue because the Iraqi government is digging in its
heels against a new U.N. resolution that could make it easier to meet
humanitarian needs.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington on Wednesday, several House members asked President Clinton to
ease nonmilitary sanctions on Iraq, saying children were suffering. Rep. David
E. Bonior, a Michigan Democrat, called the sanctions ``infanticide masquerading
as policy.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a report last year, the United Nations Children's Fund said that in
state-controlled areas of Iraq, the mortality rate among children under 5 had
more than doubled in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq's economy has been crippled by nearly a decade of strict economic
sanctions imposed after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions cannot
be lifted until weapons inspectors certify Iraq is free of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   A decade ago, one Iraqi dinar bought more than three dollars. Today, the
dinar has tumbled to nearly 2,000 to $1.
</P>
<P>
	   After 20 years of government service, Ali's father gets a pension of 250
dinars a month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My father is very sad, very sad,'' said Ali, his thin frame covered by a
torn shirt. He hid worn shoes under his desk at al-Waqidi Primary School.
</P>
<P>
	   No one in Ali's class wore new clothes. Among the 28 pupils, 10 said they
worked in the afternoons to help support their families. Mustafa Ali washes
dishes at a restaurant. Ahmad Khudheir sweeps the floor in a grocery.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who work have no time to do their homework. I excuse them,'' said
their teacher, Ban Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
	   The school recently received new desks and blackboards as part of shipments
of essential supplies Iraq is allowed to import under the U.N. program, which
allows Iraq to sell oil and use the revenues to buy goods for civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, initiated in 1996, is an exception to sanctions. The world body
hoped the program would improve the quality of life of Iraq's 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   The desks and blackboards were the only signs of improvement in Ali's life.
He already has used up the six pencils, two erasers, a sharpener and six
exercise books the government issued students at the start of the school year
almost seven months ago. His father cannot afford to buy more supplies, so Ali
relies on donations to the school from private aid groups or wealthy families.
</P>
<P>
	   His family of eight lives in two rooms. Ali's breakfast consists of bread
and tea. He doesn't remember when he last ate meat. The typical main dinner dish
for his family is rice. Millions of state employees and retirees rely on meager
monthly food rations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How you can eat oranges, vegetables and chocolates when the family's
income is only 250 dinars?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ibrahim called Ali one of her best students.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I feel there's little or no scope to nurture talented boys like him,''
she said.

</P>
<P>
	   ``Guns in the wrong hands continue to claim too many young lives,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president dismissed arguments for shortening the waiting period for
handgun purchases at gun shows. He said he wants a compromise with Congress that
would accommodate such concerns and ``have a bill that keeps people alive.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has not been a huge amount of inconvenience in the waiting period,''
Clinton said. ``There has got to be a solution here that deals with that. Maybe
they can hawk the guns at the local police department.''
</P>
<P>
	   On a more personal matter, Clinton was asked whether he might surrender his
Arkansas law license rather than fight ethical complaints that could lead to his
disbarment. He settled the sexual harassment lawsuit brought by former Arkansas
state worker Paula Jones without admitting wrongdoing, but would not say whether
he might back away from this latest legal challenge in his home state.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he settled the Jones case ``because I thought that it was wrong
for the president to take an hour, much less a day, much less weeks away from
the job of the American people for anything that could be a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``In all things that have happened subsequently, I have left a lot of things
unsaid that might otherwise have been said, and I hope I can continue to do
that,'' he replied sternly.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arkansas Supreme Court has given Clinton 30 days to respond to two
ethics complaints seeking to strip him of his law license because of his conduct
in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 156.68  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in volatile trading today as blue-chip
issues, falling victim once again to investor worries about interest rates,
ended a two-day rally. Technology stocks managed a slim advance.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 156.68 at 10,561.41, wiping out more than half of a 292-point gain in the
past two sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   American Express led the Dow lower today, tumbling as investors guessed it
will be among the stocks to suffer if the Federal Reserve continues raising
interest rates to force a slowdown in the U.S. economy. In an effort to keep
inflation under control, the Fed has raised rates four times since last June.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the Fed has received little evidence that raising rates has worked,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The U.S. economy doesn't seem to be slowing down at all," said Alan
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. "Stocks
continue to climb a wall of worry over higher interest rates."
</P>
<P>
	   The latest signs of a booming economy came today from the Commerce
Department, which reported housing construction soared in January despite a
spike in mortgage rates. Also, crude oil futures hovered around $30 per barrel,
the highest prices since Jan. 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   "The combination of higher interest rates and rising oil prices could be a
combustible combination that will cause the market to work its way lower for a
while," Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Dow components that faltered included Coca-Cola, Procter &AMP; Gamble and
Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
	   For most of the session, technology stocks appeared poised to bounce back
from three sessions of weakness brought on by profit-taking. The Nasdaq
composite index, dominated by technology, rose as much as 56 points before
trailing off in late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Applied Materials rose after announcing stronger-than-expected profits and a
robust outlook for the coming year. The company, a leading maker of
chip-manufacturing equipment, earned 80 cents per share in its most recent
quarter, topping analysts' estimates by three cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Applied Materials also announced it will split its shares two-for-one
effective March 15. The broader semiconductor sector, including LSI Logic and
Texas Instuments, rose on Applied Materials' report of strong customer demand.
</P>
<P>
	   Lycos, maker of a popular Internet search engine, rose. The company said
late Tuesday it earned 3 cents per share in its fiscal second quarter, beating
analysts' estimates of 1 cent per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the Nasdaq is showing some signs of profit-taking. The index
has risen 8.6 percent so far this year, compared with a 8.1 percent decline by
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had some marvelous advances, but then investors get into this backing
and filling stage where fear takes over," said Michael Farr, president of Farr,
Miller &AMP; Washington, a Washington, D.C.-based financial consulting firm.
"Ultimately, I think tech will continue to lead the market, but it may
struggle."
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan will address the House Banking
Committee in his semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. Analysts said investors
will listen carefully to his testimony on the state of the economy, seeking
clues to the Fed's sentiment.

<HEADLINE> German President Speaks in Israel  </HEADLINE>
   By KARIN LAUB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The first German words ever spoken in Israel's parliament
were a plea Wednesday for forgiveness for the Holocaust, but they made some
Israelis shiver nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaker Avraham Burg, whose father fled Nazi Germany in 1939, said he
thought long and hard before allowing German President Johannes Rau to address
the Knesset in what Burg called ``the language of the murderers and the
murdered.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some lawmakers stayed away in protest. However, former Speaker Shevah Weiss,
a Holocaust survivor, said that while he had very mixed feelings about German --
the first German word he ever heard was ``Achtung,'' shouted by Nazi troops in
the Warsaw Ghetto -- he believed Rau should be heard.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Knesset members did turn up for the speech, and listened politely to
Rau, introduced as an ``old friend'' who had chosen Israel for his first foreign
trip since his May election.
</P>
<P>
	   Rau opened with an emotional apology for the Holocaust, the Nazi genocide in
World War II during which 6 million Jews perished.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With the people of Israel watching, I bow in humility before those
murdered, before those who don't have graves where I could ask them for
forgiveness,'' said Rau. ``I am asking for forgiveness for what Germans have
done, for myself and my generation, for the sake of our children and
grandchildren, whose future I would like to see alongside the children of
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rau then raised familiar themes, such as the need to teach the younger
generation about Germany's troubled past, and the special relationship between
Israel and Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   He referred only indirectly to Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider,
saying Europe would not allow racism and hatred of foreigners to take root
again.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel recalled its ambassador to Austria in protest after Haider's Freedom
Party became a member of Austria's government earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he was pleased that Germany, as part
of the European Union, has taken steps against ``the coalition of shame.''
</P>
<P>
	   Barak said the Israeli-German friendship could serve as an example for
leaders of the Middle East seeking to overcome decades of hostility and
emotional baggage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not easy to overcome the traumas of the past,'' Barak said. ``But if
the president of Germany can be received in the year 2000 in the Israeli Knesset
as an old friend, then present difficulties and obstacles should not deter
leaders'' of the region, Barak said. ``This is the supreme moral obligation of
leadership. This is our obligation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has pledged to complete peace treaties with Syria and the Palestinians
this year and withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon by July. Negotiations remain
stuck amid mutual recriminations.
</P>
<P>
	   Rau's Knesset speech was one of the highlights of his four-day trip to
Israel, followed by a three-day tour of the Palestinian areas, and a stopover in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   The main theme of the Israel trip is reconciliation between German and
Israeli teen-agers. Germany's youth soccer team is traveling with the president
and will play the Israeli team Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Police Turn Violent  </HEADLINE>
   By QAISER MIRZA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Security forces burned cars and beat people with
sticks and rifle butts in the capital of Kashmir on Wednesday after militants
gunned down three officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence began in downtown Srinagar when gunmen shot and killed two
members of the Border Security Force in the busy central market of Lal Chowk.
</P>
<P>
	   Reinforcements moved in quickly, hitting people with rifle butts and sticks
and firing their guns in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   The two soldiers were making purchases in a shop when the gunmen fired on
them at close range and grabbed their guns, said R.P. Singh, deputy
inspector-general of the Border Security Force. He said a policeman chased the
gunmen and was fatally shot at close range with a pistol.
</P>
<P>
	   Kashmir policemen moved in and began beating people while Border Security
Force officers set several cars on fire and smashed dozens of windows.
</P>
<P>
	   About 5,000 people fled their shops and homes along four downtown streets
and headed for other parts of Srinagar. But many men and women were pulled from
restaurants, shops or houses and taken away for questioning.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said security officers dragged a bus conductor out of his vehicle
and beat him repeatedly. Three young men were beaten and dragged into a security
vehicle as they shouted that they were only shopkeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   A dozen shops on one street were burned down, witnesses said, but it wasn't
clear who was responsible.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence stopped when Singh and Rajinder Kumar, deputy inspector-general
of the Kashmir police, arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   The confrontation in the busiest part of Srinagar reflected the increasing
boldness of attacks on Indian security forces from insurgents seeking Kashmir's
separation from India.
</P>
<P>
	   Kashmir is the only predominantly Muslim region in mostly Hindu India and
has been the center of a 10-year insurgency by several militant groups fighting
for independence or union with Pakistan. The government security forces sent to
counter the insurgents have been accused repeatedly of human rights abuses and
hundreds of cases have been filed.
</P>
<P>
	   India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the separatist movement, a charge
Pakistan denies.
</P>
<P>
	   The two neighbors have fought three wars in the last 50 years, two of them
over Kashmir, and came close to another war last summer when the Indian military
battled and evicted Pakistan-backed fighters from strategic mountain peaks in
Indian-ruled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian and Pakistani troops clashed near the cease-fire line in Kashmir late
Tuesday, killing at least four Indian soldiers, ane Indian spokesman said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Pakistani troops fired on an Indian patrol, triggering an hour-long
exchange of gunfire in Mendhar in Poonch district, 75 miles northwest of Jammu,
the winter capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. Five Pakistani soldiers also were
believed to have been killed, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Both Parties Push Seniors' Concerns  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats are tripping over each other to
pass a law before the November elections to let working people over age 65 keep
all their Social Security payments. But Congress is still sharply divided on
another concern of the elderly: Medicare prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the outcome, the high priority both sides have placed on elderly
issues reflect the importance of older voters in determining whether Republicans
keep their slim hold on the House in this year's congressional election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The senior vote is the battleground for who gets control of the House,''
said Dan Maffei, spokesman for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The odds appear long that Congress will make progress on the biggest of
these issues: ensuring the long-term financial solvency of Medicare and Social
Security and giving people new options to invest for retirement. So lawmakers
are focusing on lesser steps that would demonstrate some accomplishment for
voters or provide a campaign issue if compromise isn't possible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody knows somebody who can't afford prescription drugs,'' said Rep.
Ronnie Shows, D-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   After languishing for years, bipartisan legislation ending the Social
Security earnings limit is on the fast track in the House, and President Clinton
is promising to sign it into law. The bill would scrap a Depression-era law that
takes away $1 in benefits for every $3 a person age 65-69 earns over $17,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
	   One reason that elimination of the earnings limit has never passed before is
that sponsors of broader Social Security reform wanted to use it as a
``sweetener'' to attract more support for that effort. Now, the bill is expected
to reach the House floor in March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At least we are moving some Social Security reform forward,'' said Rep. E.
Clay Shaw, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   But some lawmakers question this approach -- similar to what House GOP
leaders are doing with a series of tax cuts -- of moving only one popular item
through Congress instead of tackling the larger problem head-on.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It essentially represents an 'eat-dessert-first' approach to reform,''
said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, who nonetheless supports the bill. ``Congress
should be grappling with the tough choices of how to extend Social Security
solvency.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the Social Security earnings limit bill has a good chance of becoming
law, Republicans and Democrats seem less likely to settle on a Medicare
prescription drug benefit. Republicans believe Democrats will oppose any
compromise, preferring to use costly prescription drugs as a potent political
issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said Wednesday that the ``health of
Americans is more important than politics'' and accused GOP leaders of using the
election as an excuse for no action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Instead of just looking toward our own campaigns, we need a campaign for
seniors' health care,'' the Missouri Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic leaders on Wednesday began trying to force House consideration of
two bills intended to lower the costs of prescription drugs through group
purchasing power and to add an outpatient drug benefit for the 39 million people
who now receive Medicare. Democrats would have to get 218 signatures on
petitions to get the bills to the House floor.
</P>
<P>
	   But the bills are opposed by some Democrats and most Republicans, as well as
by a coalition led by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
-- the lobbying group responsible for the TV ad campaign featuring ``Flo,'' the
bowler who urges a bipartisan solution. Critics say the Democratic bills amount
to government-imposed price controls and a costly burden on the
already-faltering Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has asked the Commerce and Ways and
Means committees to work on a solution, but the GOP is divided on whether to
hold out for broader Medicare reform or concentrate on the prescription drug
issue alone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're working on it. We haven't made that decision yet,'' Hastert said in
an interview. ``We want to find the best way to do it. I'd prefer that we have a
bipartisan effort.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans say any prescription drug measure should avoid putting Medicare
in further financial jeopardy, be targeted to help the neediest senior citizens
and avoid putting government in charge. But Democrats say such restrictions
could make the bill meaningless.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be so focused, and so surgical, that it doesn't help many people
at all,'' Gephardt said. --------
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE -- The Medicare bills are H.R. 664 and H.R. 1495. The Social
Security earnings limit elimination bill is H.R. 5.

<HEADLINE> NATO Spurs Yugoslav Airport Closings  </HEADLINE>
   By KATARINA KRATOVAC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO aircraft violated Yugoslavia's airspace on
at least two occasions this month, causing the closure of the country's third
largest civilian airport, the traffic minister said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``NATO committed a flagrant violation of Yugoslav airspace and acted against
international flight regulations,'' said Dejan Drobnjakovic, from the federal
traffic ministry. ``It also jeopardized civilian flights.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from NATO.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yugoslav government on Monday closed the civilian airport in Tivat, a
coastal town in Montenegro, Serbia's smaller partner in the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
	   The airport's closure caused a wave of protests from Montenegro's
pro-Western officials, who are at odds with the regime in Belgrade. Montenegrin
media speculated other reasons were behind the airport's closing, and some
perceived it as further pressure from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
government.
</P>
<P>
	   But Drobnjakovic shrugged off ``wrong and malicious interpretations,''
saying the airport's closure was connected to ``new NATO aircraft activities
reported in the southeast Adriatic Sea this month.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to the minister, on Jan. 26, Yugoslav air control rejected a NATO
request regarding activities in the airspace above the coastal area of the
Adriatic, stretching between neighboring Croatia and Albania and including a
section of Montenegro's shoreline. The request had been passed to the Yugoslav
authorities through the International Civil Aviation Organization authorities
and NATO's European bureau in Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO has the right to conduct military flights outside Yugoslav territorial
waters, but not within, Drobnjakovic said. International procedure obliges the
Alliance to announce all flights 48 hours in advance to the ICAO.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 10, the pilot of a Slovenian Adria Airways flight en route from
Ljubljana, Slovenia, to Tirana, Albania, reported the presence of an unknown
aircraft while at an altitude of 26,200 feet, Drobnjakovic said.
</P>
<P>
	   Four days later, Belgrade air control registered up to seven unknown
aircraft on the stretch from Dubrovnik, on the coast of Croatia, to Herceg Novi
in Montenegro. This was confirmed by the pilot of a Cyprus Airlines flight from
London to Larnaca.
</P>
<P>
	   Croatian air control in Zagreb later confirmed the flights were NATO's,
Drobnjakovic said.
</P>
<P>
	   Following these two incidents, authorities were ``obliged to close the
entire air space southwest of Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, to avoid
further risks to safety,'' the traffic minister said. ``It was a drastic
measure, but a legitimate one in terms of preventing incidents.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the Paris ICAO office assured Yugoslav authorities it had
``established mechanisms to secure safety of flight operations in the region,''
Drobnjakovic said. This indicated NATO would henceforth ``play by the rules''
and announce flights 48 hours in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Later in the afternoon, the Yugoslavs lifted the ban on the Tivat airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Air traffic within Yugoslavia was halted during NATO's 78-day bombing
campaign, but resumed when the campaign ended last June. In January, civilian
air corridors in the country's upper airspace reopened to international flights.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Egyptian Defense Minister Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Gen. Mohammed Fawzi, a former defense minister who
oversaw the rebuilding of Egypt's army after its defeat in the 1967 Mideast war,
died Wednesday. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   Fawzi died in a military hospital ``after a long illness,'' the Middle East
News Agency reported, without giving the cause of death. However the
pro-government Al-Gomhuria reported Thursday that Fawzi died of kidney failure
and heart problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Egypt's then-President Gamal Abdel Nasser named Fawzi commander of the army
after the 1967 war, in which Israeli forces captured the Sinai peninsula from
Egypt and secured a cease-fire from the Arab armies in just six days. Fawzi's
No. 1 task was to rebuild and restore confidence in the shattered army.
</P>
<P>
	   The next year, Nasser appointed Fawzi to the Cabinet as defense minister,
and he supervised the so-called war of attrition against Israeli forces along
the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1971 Nasser's successor, President Anwar Sadat, fired and arrested Fawzi,
accusing him of taking part in a coup plot.
</P>
<P>
	   Sadat later pardoned Fawzi, who spent the rest of his life lecturing and
writing books on military affairs. He also joined the opposition Arab Nasserite
Democratic Party and became a member of its political bureau.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Denounces Syria's Assad  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House member furiously denounced Syrian President Hafez
Assad as a brutish thug and murderous dictator on Wednesday, enlivening an
otherwise routine hearing on U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's obviously not concerned about the well-being of his people since he
has kept his people under a totalitarian thumb -- his -- for decades,'' Rep.
Steven R. Rothman, D-N.J., declared.
</P>
<P>
	   Rothman asked Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to pass a message to
Assad that ``the American people are disgusted and outraged at the way he
continues to behave as a brutish thug of a dictator and the murderous individual
that he is.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright, who was testifying on a wide range of foreign policy issues, sat
quietly through Rothman's assertions. When he was done, she offered a single
sentence of comment, quoting the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as
saying ``you make peace with your enemies and not your friends.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, in an exchange with Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., Albright said the
Clinton administration was very disappointed that U.S.-supervised talks between
Israel and Syria did not produce ``immediate results.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said the administration would continue, at least on lower levels,
to try to promote peacemaking between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also said she had told Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in
telephone conversations that ``they need to use their influence to control the
Hezbollah,'' the Islamic fundamentalist group that has attacked Israeli soldiers
in southern Lebanon, killing seven over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   She did not reply directly, though, to Lantos' assertion that the Hezbollah
fighters were ``surrogates'' of Syria, directed by Damascus to engage in
violence and terrorism after al-Sharaa's meetings in the United States with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak did not bring ``immediate fruit.''
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiations were suspended indefinitely in January, with Syria unable
to recover the Golan Heights, a border enclave it lost in the 1967 Mideast war,
and additional land to the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel refused to make a territorial commitment until it heard more about
the kind of peace Syria proposed and the security measures that would replace
the highground to shield northern Israel from cross-border attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Rothman said Assad had kept Syria 30 to 50 years behind western societies in
development and used innocent men, women and children in his own country, in
Lebanon, in Israel and the surrounding region as pawns, willing to sacrifice
them, to slaughter them, or to see that they are slaughtered.''
</P>
<P>
	   And now, the Congress member said, Assad was reintroducing terrorism as ``a
tool in his negotiating kit'' through Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He could have peace today with Israel on terms that any reasonable,''
Rothman said. ``He could have had it 10 years ago, 20, 30 years ago.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Africa Policy Will Work  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton visited Africa and promised much. But
Africa has changed little.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has devoted more than $200 million in his budget proposals into
peacekeeping or promoting democracy since 1998, but some nations he embraced are
mired in conflict anyway, either civil or with their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   The ambitious trade bill Clinton hawked during his visit emerged from the
Senate weaker than he hoped, requiring, among other things, that imported
African fabrics be duty-free only if they are made of American threads.
</P>
<P>
	   His calls for debt relief have gone largely unanswered by European allies.
And his own pledge to forgive $500 million of African debt can hardly make a
dent, since that is a small share of the billions owed.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, Clinton must convince critics and supporters alike that his Africa
policy has not gone haywire, and will produce solid results before he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
	   His first chance comes Thursday before the National Summit on Africa, a
gathering of African leaders, private foundations and businesses that is meeting
in Washington through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday that Clinton would restate
his pledge to help African nations with peacekeeping, conflict resolution and
economic revitalization.
</P>
<P>
	   But regardless of what Clinton says Thursday, some critics believe there is
little that can be done to fix his Africa policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The record actually is disastrous,'' said American University economics
professor George Ayittey. ``Some of us want this administration to stop playing
political football with Africa. The solutions to Africa's problems can't be
micromanaged from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ayittey cited some successes in conflict resolution, in Liberia and Sierra
Leone, but said those are eclipsed by the flare-ups between some nations Clinton
embraced, such as Eritrea, Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only bright spot the administration can claim is Nigeria,'' Ayittey
said. ``But then, the democratization process in Nigeria is iffy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation and a major supplier of U.S. oil, is
a linchpin in Clinton's policy, the hope being that it can help radiate
stability to the nations around it. On Wednesday, the Clinton administration
signed a trade agreement with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
	   But the larger trade package, for Africa and the Caribbean Basin, is still
awaiting final passage in Congress, even though Clinton had hoped for passage
before the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
	   These are the type of halting, incremental steps that have marked Clinton's
approach to Africa since he returned from his 1998 tour, the most extensive of
any sitting president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My dream for this trip is that together we might do the things so that 100
years from now, your grandchildren and mine will look back and say, 'This is the
beginning of a new African renaissance,''' Clinton said upon arrival in Accra,
Ghana, on March 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   During the trip, Clinton apologized for the slow U.S. response to the 1994
genocide in Rwanda, and promised ``never again'' would it be that way.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mel Foote, head of the advocacy group Constituency for Africa, said the
conflict in Sierra Leone drew a similar response ``at the same time we're
pouring billions into Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
	   A subsequent visit by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright could have
smoothed that over, Foote said, but that trip turned into a sentimental journey
for the funeral of Julius Nyerere, the revered first president of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He showed us he cared about Africa. He doesn't have a lot of people in his
administration who can do the follow-up,'' Foote said. ``The biggest thing he
achieved was goodwill.''

<HEADLINE> Talks Fail To Dent Belfast Deadlock  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The British and Irish governments, seeking to extricate
Northern Ireland's peace process from a deepening crisis, failed Wednesday to
narrow the divisions between key parties in the province's suspended
Protestant-Catholic administration.
</P>
<P>
	   As they departed British Prime Minister Tony Blair's London residence, the
rival leaders of the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Fein traded angry
accusations over Britain's decision last week to strip authority from the
Belfast power-sharing Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've come such a long way, I simply cannot believe that we are going to
let this chance slip away,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Ireland's four-party coalition took shape just two months ago in
fulfillment of the 2-year-old Good Friday peace accord. After Wednesday's
deadlocked talks, it looked unlikely to return to power soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein, which is linked to the Irish Republican Army, emphasized the IRA
would make no disarmament commitments, as the governments demand, until Sinn
Fein regained its two posts within the 12-member Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At the moment, the Good Friday agreement is lying in a wastepaper bin. The
British government needs to get it back out, put it back together again and get
serious about the process of conflict resolution,'' said Sinn Fein's Martin
McGuinness, a former IRA commander who was the Cabinet's minister for education
until Britain resumed direct control Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ulster Unionist chief David Trimble, the Protestant who agreed to form
the administration in expectation that the IRA would disarm in response, said
his supporters wouldn't stomach resumed power-sharing with Sinn Fein until the
IRA made a firm commitment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Good Friday accord anticipated the IRA's total disarmament, along with
that of pro-British paramilitary groups, by May.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA, which is 31 months into a cease-fire, has never promised it would
gradually scrap its stockpiled weapons in cooperation with the province's
independent disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
	   And the IRA retaliated Tuesday for Britain's resumption of direct rule by
breaking off talks with the commission and withdrawing a vague proposal hinting
at the outlawed group's eventual disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   But Trimble emphasized the IRA's withdrawn plan -- which suggested the
group's hidden arsenal could be ``placed beyond use'' following unspecified
political progress -- was nowhere near what Ulster Unionists required.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not interested in cobbling together formulae of words which allow
the process to stagger on for another week or two,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble insisted the IRA should have begun identifying the location of its
weapons dumps in January as part of the compromise deal negotiated by American
diplomat George Mitchell last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We did all that we could do to make the agreement work,'' he said, adding
of Sinn Fein and the IRA: ``The ball remains firmly in their court.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, President Clinton said he didn't know ``what the end will
be'' in Northern Ireland, and called the IRA's retreat from disarmament talks
``a very unfortunate development'' that left peacemaking efforts in a ``rough
spot.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton strove to accentuate two positive points -- the fact that
Northern Ireland's citizens had liked their ``taste'' of self-government, and
that IRA commanders have ``given no indication whatever that they will revert to
violence.''
</P>
<P>
	   John Hume, the pacifist Catholic politician who shared the 1998 Nobel Peace
Prize with Trimble, agreed with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Hume, who leads Sinn Fein's larger rival for Catholic votes, the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, said that during their 10 fleeting weeks in
government, ``we worked very well together and improved the atmosphere on our
streets immeasurably.''

<HEADLINE> Implants May Aid Tremor Victims  </HEADLINE>
    By JEFF DONN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Electrodes implanted in the brain work better than more conventional surgery
in helping patients with severe tremors from Parkinson's and other diseases lead
normal lives, a study found.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists say the research is likely to expand use of the newer electrode
technique and perhaps even spur study of its effectiveness against disorders
like depression. The work is also likely to further reduce the use of the older
tremor-control brain surgery, called thalamotomy.
</P>
<P>
	   Thalamotomy is a decades-old operation that destroys overactive,
tremor-causing nerve cells by burning or freezing a pea-size spot in the brain.
But it leaves many patients with speech problems, weakness or numbness. Actor
Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson's, underwent a thalamotomy.
</P>
<P>
	   The electrode technique, known as deep-brain stimulation, was approved by
the Food and Drug Administration in 1997 and already overshadows thalamotomies
at many hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   A study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine offers
what researchers say is the best comparison of the two operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Do the results ... signal the end of thalamotomy? They offer a strong
argument for the use of deep-brain stimulation as the treatment of choice for
eligible patients," Dr. Gunther Deuschl of Christian Albrechts University in
Kiel, Germany, said in an accompanying editorial.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 2 million Americans are afflicted with essential tremor, a
hereditary disorder that causes violent shaking. Up to 1.5 million more suffer
from Parkinson's, which brings tremors, rigid limbs and a shuffling walk.
Parkinson's sufferers include Muhammad Ali and Attorney General Janet Reno.
Drugs help many but not all tremor patients.
</P>
<P>
	   In deep-brain stimulation, a wire is implanted within a walnut-size area
known as the thalamus, which acts as a relay station for sensory information.
The electrode is connected to a thin cable running down through the neck to a
half-dollar-size pulse generator that is implanted just below the collarbone.
The generator supplies a tiny electrical current that disables the overactive
nerve cells and turns off the tremors.
</P>
<P>
	   The study of 68 patients at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam,
Netherlands, found that such electrodes suppress tremors as effectively as
surgery, produce fewer side effects and do more to help patients perform daily
tasks like cooking or shopping. More than twice as many patients said they were
functioning better with the electrodes.
</P>
<P>
	   However, even the leader of the study, Dr. Richard Shuurman, said some
patients will still prefer thalamotomies because the electrodes are expensive
and involve high technology.
</P>
<P>
	   Deep-brain operations cost $20,000 to $28,000 in the United States. A
thalamotomy might cost $12,000 to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the study dealt only with stimulation of the thalamus, it gives a
boost to the growing use of electrodes on other parts of the brain to control
tremors, since it shows few side effects, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Chistopher O'Brien of the Colorado Neurological Institute said the study
should give a push to research on conditions such as compulsive disorder and
depression.

<HEADLINE> Study: Mom's Diet Won't Hurt Baby  </HEADLINE>
    By JEFF DONN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A new study offers the best evidence yet that overweight mothers who
breast-feed can diet and exercise without stunting their babies' growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Some nutritionists and mothers have worried that a weight-loss regimen might
reduce a woman's ability to produce breast milk and deprive her baby of
nourishment.
</P>
<P>
	   In a study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, researchers at the
University of North Carolina at Greensboro studied 40 exclusively breast-feeding
women who were overweight. The women were randomly assigned either to diet and
exercise or to keep up their usual diet with little exercise.
</P>
<P>
	   During the 10-week experiment, mothers in the diet-and-exercise group lost
an average of one pound a week. Yet their babies gained four pounds and grew
three inches, much like those of the other mothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts warned that the study applies only to overweight women on a balanced
diet. Nutritionist Cheryl Lovelady, who led the study, said she would suggest
that women of normal weight delay dieting or heavy exercise past breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
	   University of Iowa nutritionist Phyllis Stumbo, who has researched the link
between milk production and weight loss, said the study convincingly shows that
moderate exercise and dieting by overweight mothers are safe for their babies.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the finding is especially important in the United States, where
many new mothers worry about how they will look when they return to work.

<HEADLINE> Russia, NATO Declare Ties Restored  </HEADLINE>
   By NICK WADHAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- After nearly a year of tension over the wars in Yugoslavia
and Chechnya, Russia and NATO announced Wednesday that they are restoring their
ties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I see this as being the turning of a page of the disagreements we have and
are moving forward now to a deeper and broader agenda,'' NATO Secretary-General
Lord Robertson said after meeting with acting President Vladimir Putin and other
top officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past year, Russia had all but cut its ties with NATO and shut down
work on the Permanent Joint Council -- where the sides consult on matters of
mutual interest -- in response to NATO's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   During that time, NATO has condemned the war in Chechnya. Tension also was
aggravated by Russia's adoption of a new national security doctrine broadening
the circumstances under which it could envision using nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia also remains unhappy about NATO's eastward expansion and opposes the
drive of the former Soviet Baltic republics to become members of the Western
alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson noted that disagreements remain, saying at a news conference with
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov that the resumption of relations meant,
``We've moved from permafrost to slightly softer ground.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ivanov said the sides viewed each other as important strategic partners for
providing security in Europe and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
	   The current aim of Russia and NATO ``is to restore trust and define spheres
of interaction where we can cooperate effectively in the interests of stability
and security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   By agreeing to restore relations with NATO, Putin is sending a message that
he is not anti-Western, according to Dmitry Trenin, a defense analyst at the
Carnegie Institute for International Peace in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Putin wants to reach out to the West, and NATO has been knocking at his
door for some time,' Trenin said. ``This is a piece of political currency he can
use and he doesn't have to fear a nationalist backlash at home'' by being seen
as a liberal lacking the will to pursue the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson said NATO's stance on Chechnya had not changed, though it
understood the problems Russia faced in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We understand why Russia acted in Chechnya, but we have strongly disagreed
with what Russia did about that in Chechnya,'' Robertson said. ``The Russian
side today robustly answered the points I made ... in what was quite a strong
exchange of views.''
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrating that it was not bowing to NATO, Russia on Wednesday dispatched
a reconnaissance vessel to watch alliance vessels in the Persian Gulf. A Russian
tanker was recently detained in the Gulf for allegedly violating the
international trade embargo against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Vaccine Panel Changes Recommendation  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Worried about the high price of a vaccine that fights ear
infections, pneumonia and meningitis, a government advisory committee changed
its initial recommendation and voted Wednesday to require that fewer children
get the shots.
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine Prevenar should be administered to all children under 2, and to
those ages 2 to 5 who are at high risk of contracting the diseases, said the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices.
</P>
<P>
	   It was only the second time the committee has ever debated the potential
economic impact of a vaccine, marking a potential shift in what medical experts
consider before making a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're having to look at cost more and more," said Dr. John Modlin,
committee chairman and a professor of pediatric medicine at Dartmouth
University.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, the commitee had voted to recommend Prevenar, which costs $232
per four-dose series, for all children under 5.
</P>
<P>
	   Food and Drug Administration approval of the vaccine is expected this week,
and its manufacturer, American Home Products, will begin marketing it this
spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Prevenar fights the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae -- the leading cause
of pneumonia, meningitis and the millions of ear infections that lead to crammed
pediatrician waiting rooms every year.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a study, the vaccine reduced ear infections by 9 percent.
Doctor visits by those who were diagnosed as having chronic ear infections and
took the vaccine were down 20 percent, and there was a 20 percent reduction in
the number of children who needed tube implants to fight the infections.

<HEADLINE> Barak Aides Arrested in Scandal  </HEADLINE>
   By JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Police arrested two activists in Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's election campaign on Wednesday on suspicion of illegally raising and
using campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
	   They were the first arrests in the police investigation ordered by the
attorney general after a damning report by the state comptroller on the campaign
funding of Barak's One Israel party.
</P>
<P>
	   Police spokesman Uzi Sanduri would not identify the suspects, but Israel
radio said they were Shmuel Levi and Ronen Yamini, both named in the report as
active in several non-profit societies involved in the funding of Barak's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The police searched the homes of Lavi and Yamini, the radio said, and Yamini
was later placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   State Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg wrote that One Israel ``trampled on the
law'' in its campaign funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavi chaired Tikva Le-Yisrael (Hope for Israel), which was registered as a
society to help the poor in underprivileged neighborhoods. Goldberg said it
functioned as a front to funnel about $500,000 into Barak's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Tikva Le-Yisrael was in effect responsible for putting up billboards
supporting Barak's election, Goldberg said. Yamini was also active in the group.
</P>
<P>
	   The police are also investigating the campaign funding of the opposition
Likud party and three other parties, but those sums are much smaller.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has declared that he instructed his aides from the instructions were
carried out. He also said he was not personally involved in the fundraising, was
not familiar with the details, and knew of no wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Likud leaders who visited the police fraud squad in Tel Aviv Wednesday,
rejected this.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that the prime minister not only knew, but it was the prime
minister who stood at the head of that entire apparatus,'' legislator Limor
Livnat told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Likud lawmakers said they were bringing the police evidence of
violations of the campaign funding laws by One Israel, which were not mentioned
in the State Comptroller's report.
</P>
<P>
	   One Israel party leaders have similarly asked police to investigate alleged
abuses in the successful 1996 Likud campaign, and have presented police with
what they say is evidence that does not appear in that year's comptroller's
report.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Father Wants Update on Son  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP ) -- Elian Gonzalez's father said in a letter published Wednesday
that he wants Cuban diplomats based in Washington to meet with his 6-year-old
son in Miami and check on his condition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are worried not only about his prolonged kidnapping,'' Juan Miguel
Gonzalez wrote in a letter published on the front page of the Communist Party
daily Granma. ``We lack direct information about the concrete conditions to
which he is subjected in his daily life.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate response from the U.S. government to the request. It
was likely to be opposed by Elian's Miami relatives, who are fighting to keep
the boy in the United States and who have said they think Gonzalez is being
controlled by Fidel Castro's government.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez also wrote to Attorney General Janet Reno earlier this week,
demanding that Elian be returned to him and saying he does not recognize the
courts hearing the custody battle. The Justice Department said it was reviewing
that letter.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez's second letter to Reno in two weeks was published in Granma on
Tuesday.

<P>
	   ``I formally object to the legal moves made or being made by those who are
arbitrarily retaining Elian,'' Gonzalez said in the letter, dated Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the letter, Gonzalez said he does not recognize the jurisdiction of the
U.S. court system, which is weighing an attempt by Elian's Miami relatives to
block his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the focus of an international custody battle since he was
found on an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. The boy's mother and 10
other people died when their boat sank on the way from Cuba to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian is staying with his paternal great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, who is
fighting to keep the boy with him in the United States. Cuban exiles in Miami
say the boy's mother died to give him freedom in the United States, while the
Cuban government maintains Elian is being improperly kept from his father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Juan Miguel must not have written the letter himself,'' said Armando
Gutierrez, spokesman for Elian's relatives in Miami. ``Castro must be dreaming
for the family to allow Cuban spies inside Lazaro Gonzalez's home.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the relatives in Miami filed a brief in federal court on Monday
arguing the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot return Elian to Cuba
without holding a political asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. government lawyers have moved to dismiss the Miami relatives' lawsuit,
arguing that they have no legal standing in the boy's case. The INS ruled last
month that only Elian's father has the right to speak for the boy in immigration
matters.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mostly Down in Quiet Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against most major currencies Wednesday
in quiet trading ahead of Congressional testimony Thursday by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro clawed back some more ground from the dollar, edging up to 98.68
cents from 98.12 cents late Tuesday. The dollar also slipped against other key
currencies such as the British pound but inched higher against the Japanese yen,
rising to 109.39 yen from 109.05.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was pretty quiet today," said Joseph Barnea, a foreign exchange trader
at Bank Leumi in New York. "Most of the market is holding out" ahead of
Greenspan's regularly scheduled testimony on the economy to the House Banking
Committee on Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Currency markets felt relatively little impact from a government report that
January housing starts rose to the highest level in a year in the latest sign of
rapid growth in the U.S. economy despite four interest rate increases since June
by the Fed.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists are already expecting the Fed to raise interest rates again this
year in order to cool down inflationary pressures and are looking to Greenspan's
testimony for more clues.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.6256 Swiss francs, down from 1.6366, and
1.4544 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4569. The British pound rose to $1.6072
from $1.5964.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9822 German marks,
down from 1.9931; 6.6480 French francs, down from 6.6846; and 1,962.37 Italian
lire, down from 1,973.17.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in volatile trading today as
blue-chip issues, falling victim once again to investor worries
about interest rates, ended a two-day rally. Technology stocks
managed a slim advance. The Dow Jones industrial average was down
156.68 at 10,561.41, wiping out more than half of a 292-point gain
in the past two sessions. Broader stock indicators were mixed. The
Nasdaq composite index rose 6.88 to 4,427.65. American Express led
the Dow lower today, tumbling as investors guessed it will be among
the stocks to suffer if the Federal Reserve continues raising
interest rates to force a slowdown in the U.S. economy.

	   Clinton Releases Heating Funds
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today ordered the release of
the remainder of federal heating assistance money to help families
in the Northeast hit hard by this year's cold weather and the
soaring cost of home heating oil. Clinton said he ordered the
release of $125 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance
Program to help families who must rely on oil to heat their homes.
He also said he would seek $600 million in emergency funds for the
program in his supplemental budget request, so that there will be
money to help others stay cool during the hot summer months.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Housing construction grew by 1.5 percent in
January -- to the surprise of many analysts who had been expecting a
decline of 3.5 percent. The Commerce Department said housing
construction rose to its highest level in a year despite harsh
weather in parts of the country and a continued rise in mortgage
rates. Builders began work on new units at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.78 million last month.

	   H&AMP;R Block Seeks To Reassure Public
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- H&AMP;R Block Inc. sought to reassure taxpayers
today about the integrity of its Internet tax filing system
following a glitch that accidentally permitted some people to see
other's financial data. The world's largest tax preparer shut down
its online filing system for the week after nine customers were
able over the weekend to view limited portions of another person's
file. H&AMP;R Block officials say the problem was caused as software
was updated, and that computer hackers or other outside sources
were not to blame. Nevertheless, the Kansas City, Mo.-based company
emphasized today that it did not lose any taxpayer data and that
everything should be back to normal for its 300,000 online
customers by this weekend. The problem was confined to the online
service, the company said.

prepared to combine to create the world's largest pharmaceutical
company. SmithKline Beecham's 1999 earnings increasing by 13
percent. Glaxo Wellcome's annual earnings grew by 6 percent, before
a special charge to pay for restructuring costs reduced annual
earnings by 1 percent. ``They're pretty much in line with our

	   Ex-Bank of NY Exec Pleads Guilty
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Bank of New York executive and her
husband pleaded guilty today to money laundering charges, admitting
they accepted $1.8 million to arrange a tax-evasion scheme
involving the illegal transfer of as much as $10 billion from
Russia. The former executive, Lucy Edwards, and her husband, Peter
Berlin, entered their pleas in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
The couple admitted allowing Russian bankers to set up unlicensed
banking operations in New York's borough of Queens and in Jersey
City, N.J., so the Russians could illegally move large amounts of
money through accounts at the Bank of New York to evade taxes in
both Russia and the United States.

	   Most Schools Are Connected to Web

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly every public school in the United
States has an Internet connection, with access jumping from a
little over one-third of schools to 95 percent in just five years,
the Education Department said today. The rapid expansion from 1994
to 1999, say school technology supporters, is due to everything
from increased donations by technology companies eager to train
future workers to Clinton administration efforts such as the E-rate
program -- funded by a special fee on phone bills -- that helps
provide discounted Internet connections for schools and libraries.

who is the center of an international custody fight, was the

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors offer phone records to show cops allegedly coordinated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Charles Schwarz and two other police officers worked out
a common story for investigators in a frenetic flurry of phone calls in the days
after the stationhouse assault of Abner Louima, federal prosecutors suggested
Wednesday.
<P>
	   FBI agent Joseph Foelsch testified there were 59 calls involving the trio
and a few other officers in the four days after the Aug. 9, 1997 incident - more
than seven times as many contacts as they had by phone in the previous 10 weeks.
The number of calls reached 150 over the next 2 1/2 months, Foelsch said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 34, Thomas Bruder, 33, and Thomas Wiese, 36, are accused of
conspiring to obstruct justice by claiming Schwarz was never in the bathroom
when Officer Justin Volpe sodomized the Haitian immigrant with a broken
broomstick. Schwarz was convicted last year of violating Louima's civil rights
by holding him down.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad was expected to rest the government's
case on Thursday after briefly recalling Foelsch. That would clear the way for
Volpe to testify, possibly as the defense's leadoff witness.
</P>
<P>
	   Brought from prison, where he is serving 30 years for violating Louima's
civil rights, Volpe is expected to say - as he did after his sentencing last
year - that Schwarz was not the "second officer" in the bathroom. Wiese says it
was he who entered the room briefly during the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors contend that the three defendants, seeking to conceal Schwarz's
role, coordinated their stories in a private meeting and the many phone calls,
while appealing to other 70th Precinct cops to keep silent.
</P>
<P>
	   Police union trustee Michael Immitt testified earlier that he urged cops at
several roll calls not to discuss the case, but denied trying to impede the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   As one of its last witnesses, the prosecution called Anthony Abbate, a
former stationhouse crony of Schwarz who was fired from the police department in
1996 for verbally abusing a female officer during an argument and then lying
about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
	   Abbate, a participant with Schwarz or Wiese in 36 calls on the FBI list,
said he was trying to give support to Schwarz as a friend, but denied suggesting
that they concoct a scenario that put Wiese instead of Schwarz in the bathroom
with Volpe and Louima.
</P>
<P>
	   Abbate acknowledged telling a federal grand jury in early 1998 that Schwarz
had told him that he, Schwarz, escorted Louima to the lavatory. But he quoted
Wiese as having "repeated, over and over, that Schwarz was never in the
bathroom."
</P>
<P>
	   Abbate, who now works as a construction laborer, said he had been falsely
accused in the incident that led to his being dismissed from the force.

<HEADLINE> Villagers skeptical of safety claim after steam release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) - The steam was barely radioactive, its escape from
the Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor "momentary and minuscule," officials said.
There was no health danger, no need to warn nearby residents, no reason to keep
the kids home from school.
<P>
	   But some people living in the shadow of Indian Point said Wednesday that
they should have been let in on Tuesday night's accident, the most serious in
the 26-year history of the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   "Where were the sirens?" asked David Coviello, 55, who lives two doors from
the plant gate. "I have a 7-year-old son, an 18-year-old daughter."
</P>
<P>
	   Salvatore Simone said officials should notify residents of any accident,
regardless of its seriousness. "I should decide for myself," he said. "I might
have gotten into the car with my family and gotten away."
</P>
<P>
	   The sirens kept still because officials in four counties agreed that there
was no reason to set them off, said Westchester's deputy county executive, Jay
Hashmall, stepping in for County Executive Andrew Spano. Spano went to Los
Angeles Wednesday morning, coincidentally to examine that city's emergency
operations center.
</P>
<P>
	   Guidelines from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission "call for the sounding of
sirens only when some protective action is needed," such as evacuations or
stay-inside orders, Hashmall said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said no such measures were needed because the radioactivity
released was "completely unmeasurable," said Con Ed Vice President Steve Quinn.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Con Ed declared an alert, a first for the plant, which is on
the Hudson River about 35 miles north of Times Square and has 15.5 million
people within a 50-mile radius. An alert is one of four categories of nuclear
events identified by the NRC. In order from least serious to most serious they
are: unusual event, alert, site area emergency and general emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   The only general emergency at a U.S. nuclear plant was the March 1979
accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Mindy Landau of the NRC said there are an average of three or four alerts a
year among the nation's 103 operating reactors.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday night's alert was expected to be lifted Wednesday when water
temperatures cooled to below 200 degrees. Workers would then begin looking for
what caused the leak and determining how long the plant would be idle.
</P>
<P>
	   Quinn said the accident was caused by a leak in a tube carrying hot,
slightly radioactive water through a a pool of cooler water, which is thereby
turned into steam. The steam is used to turn a turbine, which generates
electricity. The plant produces about a seventh of the power Con Ed supplies to
its 3 million customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the hot water was under high pressure, it turned into steam as it
escaped from the tube at about 7:30 p.m. It was vented through the building's
roof, but a radiation detector in the vent sounded an alarm and automatically
closed the vent, so the slightly radioactive steam escaped into the air for only
a few seconds, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Radiation measurements taken around the plant found nothing above normal
background radiation, Quinn said, and workers were not exposed to anything above
what they get in a normal workday. No one was injured, he said, and "There is no
danger to the health and welfare of the general public."
</P>
<P>
	   Some villagers in Buchanan took that with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm definitely afraid," said Regina Ervin, just four doors from the plant
entrance. "I'm afraid to brush my teeth. I'm afraid to make the coffee."
</P>
<P>
	   Others, however, said they have learned to live with the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   David Allen, a magazine writer from Buchanan, said, "I guess I trust that
they'll tell us if there's a problem." George Kiljarian of Ossining, a retired
attorney, said, "I'm a fatalist. I made it through World War II. ... If they've
never had a problem in 26 years I guess that's all right."
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Jacobs, executive director of the Westchester People's Action
Coalition, said the Indian Point plants are old and failing and should be
investigated independent of the NRC.
</P>
<P>
	   NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan said steel-alloy tubes like the one that leaked
"have been known to develop leaks from time to time." Con Ed's Robert Leonard
said the tubes at Indian Point 2 were the originals from 1974. In the past, when
leaks were found, a tube might simply be plugged and not used because the
generator does not need all of the 200 tubes it has, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The nearby Indian Point 3 reactor, owned by the state Power Authority, has
been tentatively purchased for $806 million by Entergy Corp. of New Orleans,
which said Monday that it was also interested in buying Indian Point 2. Entergy
spokesman Carl Crawford said Wednesday that Tuesday's leak had no effect on
either deal.

<HEADLINE> Another year, another court fight over St. Pat's parade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Comparing gay Irish protesters to party crashers, a city
lawyer argued Wednesday that the Giuliani administration violated no one's First
Amendment rights by refusing to grant the demonstrators a permit to march on St.
Patrick's Day.
<P>
	   But an attorney for the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization, speaking in U.S.
District Court, said the decision to keep the group from marching before the
official parade was the product of a "backroom political process."
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyers swapped charges in closing arguments after a three-week trial,
the end result of a 1996 lawsuit filed against the city by ILGO when the Irish
gays were blocked - again - from marching on St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury deliberations began Wednesday afternoon, with the panel out for about
two hours before breaking for the day. The court battle over the group's
inclusion at the parade has become an annual event since ILGO first surfaced in
1991.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the lawsuit, the city violated ILGO's First Amendment rights to
free speech by refusing to allow it a permit to march up Fifth Avenue
immediately prior to the nation's oldest and largest St. Patrick's Parade. The
city did so in 1996, 1997 and 1998, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
	   If a federal jury agrees, ILGO could receive financial damages and U.S.
District Court Judge John G. Koeltl could issue a ruling allowing them to march
before this year's parade.
</P>
<P>
	   City attorney Virginia Waters said the city's decision was not tied to
ILGO's politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, she cited a 1993 court order barring ILGO from marching in the main
parade; traffic and other problems caused by granting a permit; and the city's
offer to let ILGO march somewhere off Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
	   "ILGO claims it is flexible, as long as it can march where it wants and when
it wants," said Waters, comparing the group to "an uninvited guest" at a party.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ancient Order of Hibernians, which oversees the parade, predictably
agreed with the city. They had successfully argued that ILGO could be banned
because the parade was a private, not public, event.
</P>
<P>
	   "When it's a private parade," said Ernest Mathews, attorney for the
Hibernians, "the government can't tell you who can march or what your message
must be."
</P>
<P>
	   But ILGO attorney Diane Knox said the city's excuses were "smoke. There's no
good reason why ILGO can't have a march of 2,000 people. There's no reason at
all."

<P>
	   BCE Inc., a Montreal telecommunications conglomerate, has made a bid for
Teleglobe that values the company at about $33.25 per share, a discount to its
recent stock price. Teleglobe also posted fourth-quarter earnings that missed
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The company earned 51 cents per share in its fiscal first quarter, up from
15 cents per share in the first quarter of 1999. Hadco makes electronic
interconnection products.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Tuesday, the company reported second-quarter operating profits of 3
cents a share, beating analysts' forecasts of 1 cent per share. Lycos said
strong sales from electronic commerce helped boost results.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will acquire TransPoint LLC in a stock swap valued at about $1
billion, eliminating one of its biggest rivals in providing online bill payment
and delivery. The acquisition makes CheckFree the clear leader in the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   An undisclosed cellular service provider has ordered 27 SuperFilter Systems
from Superconductor Technologies. The company would not specify the client or
the value of the order. The systems cut distortion and noise in cellular phone
calls and allow customers to talk longer.

    By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The network that runs the nation's transplant system is
proposing a more sophisticated system of ranking patients waiting for new livers
and said it will consider sharing donated organs over larger areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Both proposals are attempts to move closer to the Department of Health and
Human Services, which wants a new allocation system that would direct more
livers to the sickest transplant patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the current system, patients in certain parts of the country get
transplants much quicker than those in other areas, partly because donated
livers are distributed to local patients first, even if there is someone sicker
in a neighboring community or region.
</P>
<P>
	   HHS and the United Network for Organ Sharing have been battling over
allocation policy for nearly two years now, since HHS issued regulations that
directed the network to develop new policies for distribution of livers and
other donated organs.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has put those regulations on hold several times, with the latest
moratorium set to expire next month. The issue has been subject to an intense
battle among transplant centers and patient groups, which have aggressively
lobbied Congress. Congress has also clashed sharply with the White House, which
wanted the HHS rules to take effect last year.
</P>
<P>
	   But despite the fighting in Washington, the transplant network's liver
committee has proposed the outline of a new way to distribute livers, the organ
that has engendered the most controversy.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the current system, liver patients are put into various groups,
depending on how sick they are: Status 1 is for the very sickest patients, those
expected to die within a week without a transplant. Those in status 2a are also
very sick and in the hospital. Most patients are not as sick and are in status
2b or 3.
</P>
<P>
	   Patients are now ranked within each category based on how long they have
been on the list waiting, with those waiting longest getting the next matching
liver that is donated. But the Institute of Medicine, which studied the issue
last year, concluded that waiting time is not a good criteria, partly because
some patients go on the list much earlier than others.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal released Wednesday, patients within status 2b and 3 would
be ranked based on a sophisticated, objective point system. Patients would get
points based on their symptoms. The presence or absence of certain chemicals in
the blood stream, for instance, would translate into a certain number of points.
Those with the most points would be at the top of the list for donated livers.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the point system is developed, the network said it would examine
creating larger allocation areas -- which HHS has pushed for and the Institute
of Medicine recommended.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal is now available for public comment, and still must be approved
by the network's board, which intends to submit it to HHS by March 16, when the
new regulations are set to take effect.
</P>
<P>
	   HHS was cautiously optimistic, said John Nelson, who oversees the transplant
program for HHS. "It's moving in the right direction."

<HEADLINE> Driver Held in Drug Smuggle Scandal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Police on Wednesday arrested the Colombian chauffeur
of Laurie Hiett, the U.S. Army colonel's wife who smuggled $700,000 worth of
heroin to New York City through the embassy's mail service.
</P>
<P>
	   Jorge Ayala, who allegedly conspired with Hiett in shipping the drugs, was
captured in a Bogota restaurant, state security police chief Col. German
Jaramillo told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   A longtime driver to U.S. military commanders in Colombia, Ayala will
probably be extradited to the United States where he faces a New York
indictment, Jaramillo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hiett pleaded guilty Jan. 28 to mailing the drugs at the same time that her
husband, Army Col. James Hiett, was the U.S. military attache in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Hiett insists her husband never knew and no charges were brought
against him, the case was an embarrassment for the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
	   Laurie Hiett surrendered to federal authorities in August after they
intercepted two 2 1/2-pound packages of heroin mailed to a New York contact with
her return address from the embassy.
</P>
<P>
	   She first pleaded innocent, claiming she'd sent the parcels as a favor to
Ayala and thought they contained books, candy, coffee and Colombian artifacts.
</P>
<P>
	   But after a co-defendent in New York pleaded guilty Jan. 5, Hiett sought a
plea bargain. Free on bond, she faces sentencing in April and faces up to nine
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   After pleading guilty, Hiett talked openly to reporters about battling drug
addiction and said she was sorry her case made headlines at a time when the
United States is waging a costly war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Col. Hiett was transferred to Fort Monroe, Va. The couple still live
together along with their two sons.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bank of NY Exec Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Bank of New York executive and her husband pleaded
guilty Wednesday to laundering billions of dollars from Russia in one of the
biggest such schemes in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
	   The pleas were the first major admissions of wrongdoing since the
investigation caused an international scandal last August and strained relations
between Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing side by side, Lucy Edwards, 41, and Peter Berlin, 46, each told a
federal judge how they used Edwards' position as a vice president in the bank's
Eastern European division to help Russian bankers launder more than $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators believe most of the money came from Russian importers trying
to avoid taxes, though they are looking into whether some came from Russian
mobsters. No one directly addressed the matter in court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But a prosecutor did say that $300,000 of the laundered money was ransom for
a kidnapping in Russia. And Edwards said the bankers she teamed up with in 1995
at the Russian bank DKB had some sinister connections.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was aware that personnel for DKB were on occasion in fear of their
customers and afraid to leave the bank because they said customers with machine
guns were waiting for them," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also said Russian banking officials were accomplices in the scam.
The administration of former President Boris Yeltsin has called the Bank of New
York allegations a creation by the West to tarnish Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards and Berlin, a Russian businessman, surrendered to the FBI on Tuesday
after flying to New York from London, where they had been living.
</P>
<P>
	   They could face up to 10 years in prison at sentencing May 3 but could get
lesser sentences by identifying others involved. They also agreed to surrender
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI's New York office, called
the pleas a significant development but said "much remains to be done" in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   T. Barry Kingham, an attorney for Edwards and Berlin, said the couple will
keep cooperating with investigators. "They are anxious to fulfill their
obligations here and resume a normal life," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dressed in black and smiling frequently during the hearing, Edwards
described creating an illegal banking network for Russians -- without required
licenses -- that was run through accounts at the Bank of New York. The Bank of
New York was not accused of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Money laundering involves moving deposits through a series of accounts to
disguise their illicit source. In this case, Edwards and her husband set up
accounts at Bank of New York offices in New York City and Jersey City, N.J., in
the names of shell companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank provided the companies with software that was then used by the
Russians to transfer money, cheating the Russian government out of customs
duties and tax revenue, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said she "suspected the accounts were being used by many people for
illicit purposes."
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange, Edwards and her husband were paid $1.8 million, a percentage of
the money being moved, she said. "We were paid substantial commissions for doing
very little work," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also said that after the couple moved to London in 1996, they paid a
Bank of New York employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, $500 a month to make sure the
accounts were operating properly.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev was indicted last month on perjury charges for allegedly lying
to a federal grand jury about whether she or her husband had ever received money
or loans from Edwards. Kudryavtsev's lawyer has said any money she received was
a product of her friendship with Edwards.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also admitted she used her position at the Bank of New York to help
hundreds of Russians, most of them affiliated with the Russian banking industry,
to enter the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy to commit money
laundering and operating an unlawful banking business. Each will remain free on
$500,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   An alleged accomplice in the money transfers, Aleskey Volkov, remains a
fugitive.

<HEADLINE> Palladium at 4th New High In a Row  </HEADLINE>
    By TAMMY WEBBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Prices for palladium futures -- fueled by supply shortages
from Russia -- are so high, some traders are bowing out of the market with a
warning that investors could easily get burned.
</P>
<P>
	   Palladium futures prices continued their precipitous climb, Wednesday,
settling up $52.80 at $711.15 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
after reaching $720 -- the fourth consecutive all-time high.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, sugar futures prices fell to new contract lows and
soybeans futures prices sagged.
</P>
<P>
	   The palladium market is being sparked purely by demand and speculation, a
situation that makes trading the metal perilous at best, said David Meger,
senior metals analyst at Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's trading in a very surreal environment right now; obviously there is
panic buying in the marketplace," Meger said, adding that he refuses to trade in
palladium in the current environment.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a huge potential for risk," he said. "Now we're trading in a
market that is almost 100 percent ruled by knee-jerk emotions."
</P>
<P>
	   Russia, which dominates palladium production, has been promising to begin
resupplying the metal to the market in large volume soon, after a lengthy delay
blamed on bureaucratic hangups. Meanwhile, world supplies have shrunk and prices
have climbed steeply. Palladium is used primarily in catalytic converters.
</P>
<P>
	   Sugar futures prices fell to new contract lows on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP;
Cocoa Exchange, pressured by a large world supply.
</P>
<P>
	   March world sugar settled down .18 cent at 4.95 cents a pound. The glut was
caused partly by a huge 1999-2000 Brazilian crop. Prices also are pressured by
news that Russia expects to harvest more sugar beets this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybean futures prices reversed early gains, settling down in trading
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade on pressure from falling soymeal prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans had risen in early trading amid reports China may have bought up to
500,000 tons of soybeans from the United States in the past week.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn futures prices closed higher, despite pressure from soybean futures and
reports that Russia canceled a 237,000-ton shipment of corn from the United
States. Wheat futures prices fell slightly, pressured partly by forecasts for
storms through the Plains states Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell  3/4 cent to $2.65 1/4 a bushel; March corn
rose  3/4 cent to $2.23 a bushel; May oats fell  1/4 cent to $1.15 a bushel; and
March soybeans fell 1 1/4 cents to $5.07 1/2 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Pork futures prices closed sharply higher and beef futures prices also rose
in trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   April live cattle rose .25 cent to 70.87 cents a pound; March feeder cattle
rose .15 cent to 83.02 cents a pound; April lean hogs rose 1.33 cents to 57.35
cents a pound; and March frozen pork bellies rose 3 cents to 86.32 cents a
pound.

<HEADLINE> New York congressman says he's reconsidering support for Bush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Accusing George W. Bush of being "almost blind to
Catholic sensibilities," a New York congressman said he may abandon the Texas
governor and back Arizona Sen. John McCain.
<P>
	   "I'm seriously reconsidering my support for Bush right now," Rep. Peter King
said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   King, a Nassau County Republican who is a Roman Catholic, said he is
troubled by Bush's recent appearance at the conservative Bob Jones University in
South Carolina. The school has come under fire for opposing interracial dating
and espousing anti-Catholic views. King and most of New York's GOP establishment
have endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   "Him speaking at Bob Jones is going to make him very hard to defend him in
New York," King said. "And personally I have a hard time knowing if I want to as
a Catholic."
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Jones Jr., then president of the university, said in 1987 he would "as
soon speak to the devil himself" as talk to Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
	   Other New York Catholic Republicans defended Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-Oneida County, said Bush was spreading his
message, "not embracing the school's philosophy."
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John McHugh, R-Watertown, said he disagreed with Bush's decision to go
to the school.
</P>
<P>
	   'But I know for a fact that George Bush doesn't harbor a single
anti-Catholic or discriminatory thought in his mind," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, another Bush supporter, also said
going to Bob Jones was wrong but said his support remained with Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to evaluate a candidate on their full record," he said Wednesday
at a campaign stop in Plattsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   But King's comments come as some other New York Republicans say privately
they are worried about Bush's lackluster campaign so far and are anxious to see
how Saturday's primary in South Carolina plays out. New York's primary is March
7.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, another Bush backer, said recently he thinks
McCain is building the kind of momentum that could topple Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign did not return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Bush and McCain camps view the South Carolina primary as critical.
For McCain, a win would continue the momentum he began with his victory over the
better-financed Bush in New Hampshire. For Bush, whose prolific early fund
raising and widespread support made him seen almost invincible, another loss
could spell real trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain had trouble even getting on the ballot in New York because of the
state's complicated election laws. But New York's political leadership abandoned
their attempt to keep McCain off the ballot after he launched a public relations
offensive embarrassing to Bush and to Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   King is known for being something of a maverick. He was one of only two New
York Republicans to vote against impeaching President Clinton. King's wife,
Rosemary, is already voting for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   King also took issue Wednesday with Bush's comments the night before on the
faltering Irish peace process. In a televised debate, Bush said the peace
process was collapsing.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's irresponsible to say that the peace process is collapsing when talks
are still going on," said King, who has been closely involved in Irish politics
and the peace process. "To me he just couldn't resist taking the shot at Clinton
even if it means undermining the Irish peace process."

<HEADLINE> 2 Norwegians Begin 4-month Ski Trek  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Two Norwegian adventurers set off Wednesday on what may
be the world's worst ski trip, a four-month trek across the frozen Arctic Ocean
from Russia to Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Rune Gjeldnes and Torry Larsen, both 28, hope to be the first to ever make
the 1,677 mile trek on foot with no outside assistance or resupply of any kind.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past decade, nine expeditions have tried and failed to set one of the
last great polar records.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are in good moods and very glad to have gotten started,'' their
spokesman Gunnar Vetlejord told the Norwegian news agency NTB.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men are both members of a Norwegian navy unit similar to the U.S.
Navy's special forces, known as the Seals.
</P>
<P>
	   They are also veteran polar adventurers and were the first to ski the
1,863-mile length of Greenland without any outside help or supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   The men set off from Cape Arctchesky in northern Russia, with Russian
soldiers firing their Kalashnikov automatic rifles into the air in a farewell
salute, according to an Internet home page set up to follow the expedition.
</P>
<P>
	   The men are pulling about 270 pounds of food and other supplies on sleds for
the planned trek from northwestern Russia, to the North Pole and on to Ward
Island in northern Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The worst dangers of the expedition are the pack ice, the open ocean,
polar bears, the extreme wind and of course the low temperatures,'' Larsen said
before leaving Norway.
</P>
<P>
	   Temperatures can dip down to minus 67 degrees Fahrenheit. And since they are
skiing across the frozen waters of the Arctic Ocean, they must reach the other
side before the edges of the ice begin to break up in the spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Along the way, they will also conduct a series of medical and psychological
experiments to help researchers.
</P>
<P>
	   Norwegians have set a string of polar records, starting with Roald
Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole in 1911, when he beat Robert Scott of
Britain in a race to be first. Scott and his team died on their way out.

<HEADLINE> Parole board denies early release for Eagles executive's wife  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A state parole board on Wednesday refused to release
the wife of a Philadelphia Eagles executive who has served four months in jail
for a fatal hit-and-run accident.
<P>
	   Saying she had twice violated rules of a work-release program, the
two-member board denied Karen Jill Howard's request to cut short her nearly
one-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   "She was given an opportunity to have some freedom on a limited basis, and
she blew it," said Andrew B. Consovoy, the parole board's chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Howard was admitted to the program in November, working in a clerical
job on weekdays. Consovoy said she violated one of the program's rules, was
warned about it, then did it again. He would not say specifically what she had
done.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was severe misbehavior," he said. "It dealt with who you contact and who
you associate with."
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Howard demonstrated a continuing lack of remorse over the
accident that killed Robert Hoagland, 29, of Atco, as he changed a tire on the
side of a highway on Oct. 11, 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's been less than truthful about what happened," Consovoy said. "She's
really not prepared to go back out and live normally yet. Our psychological
evaluations of her, matched up with her interview, indicate she still has
serious problems she's not dealing with."
</P>
<P>
	   Because there are only a few months left in her term, no new parole hearing
was scheduled, said Bob Egles, executive director of the state parole board.
</P>
<P>
	   "She'll serve out the remainder of her term," Egles said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her attorney, Teri Lodge, did not immediately return a telephone message
left at her office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Howard, 36, of Evesham, is the wife of Philadelphia Eagles public
relations director Ron Howard.
</P>
<P>
	   She began serving her jail term in October after pleading guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   The case received national attention and prompted efforts to change state
laws to mandate prison terms in fatal hit-and-runs.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge Louis F. Hornstine sentenced her to 360 days in the
county jail and five years' probation. Prosecutors had said she would likely
become eligible for parole after serving about four months.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoagland was changing a tire on Interstate 76 in Gloucester City when he was
struck. Mrs. Howard fled after stopping briefly to inquire if he was all right
and learning that he was not.
</P>
<P>
	   Consovoy said she described the impact as "hitting a speed bump."
</P>
<P>
	   Hoagland and his wife Maureen were returning home from celebrating their
first wedding anniversary at an Eagles' game.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Howard was also returning home from the football game. She has said she
swerved while turning around to look at her crying 4-year-old son. She pleaded
guilty to trying to cover up the accident by washing away evidence and returning
her sports utility vehicle to a Vineland dealership.
</P>
<P>
	   She is scheduled to appear before Hornstine Friday in a separate attempt to
get her sentence reduced.

<HEADLINE> Haider Denied Holocaust Center Trip  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Austrian right-wing political figure Joerg Haider, on an
unannounced private visit to Canada, was prohibited from touring Montreal's
Holocaust Center on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Moshe Ronen, president of the Canadian Jewish Congress, said Canada's Jewish
community was concerned about Haider's unannounced visit and questioned Haider's
motives in asking to tour the Holocaust center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our advice to the museum was not to accommodate this bizarre request,''
Ronen said. ``They did not accommodate the visit.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's itinerary was unknown. Journalists gathered at the Ritz-Carlton
Hotel in Montreal, where he was believed to be staying, but there was no comment
from Haider or any associates.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada has downgraded relations with Austria over the inclusion of Haider's
Freedom Party in the government. Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said
Wednesday that Canada received no advance notice that Haider would be arriving
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Certainly there was no indication from the Austrian government or embassy
that he would be coming,'' Axworthy said. ``It is unusual but there is no visa
requirement for Austrian citizens so anybody can get on a plane and arrive in
Canada and if they have a proper passport they are given entry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since Haider's Freedom Party became part of Austria's coalition government
on Feb. 4, several countries have protested. Israel withdrew its ambassador from
Vienna, and Israeli Interior Minister Natan Sharansky has banned the populist
leader from entering the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has praised Adolf Hitler's ``orderly'' economic policies and has

<HEADLINE> Mohegans planning $800 million expansion to casino complex  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   UNCASVILLE, Conn. (AP) - The Mohegan Indians are planning an $800
million expansion to their casino complex, including a hotel, convention center,
shops and other amenities, the tribe said Wednesday.
<P>
	   The development is expected to create about 4,000 permanent jobs and
increase the Mohegan Sun's stature as a rival to the larger and older Foxwoods
Resort Casino, operated by the neighboring Mashantucket Pequots.
</P>
<P>
	   The construction is already underway and is expected to be completed by the
spring of 2002, said Michael Estess, executive vice president of marketing for
Mohegan Sun.
</P>
<P>
	   The $325 million Mohegan Sun opened in October 1996. It was originally built
without a hotel. But it was built without a hotel and that affected the amount
of time people could stay at the casino, Estess said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The hotel's going to create a whole new business for us in the meeting and
convention business," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The project will be paid with $360 million worth of high-yield bonds and a
loan from Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
	   By the numbers, the expansion plans include a 1,200-room hotel, 100,000
square feet of convention space with 30 meeting rooms and a 40,000-square-foot
ballroom.
</P>
<P>
	   The 40-story hotel tower will visible from Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribe also plans to built a 175,000-square-foot retail complex offering
brand-name merchandise, a 10,000-seat arena and 115,000 square feet of new
casino space, to accommodate 2,500 more slot machines and 75 more table games.
</P>
<P>
	   The old casino has an Earth-based theme, and the new addition will invoke
images of the sky.
</P>
<P>
	   A centerpiece of the expansion is a six-story alabaster tower with a
cocktail lounge and a planetarium dome with projections of the heavens.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, crystals and multicolored beads will reflect light around the new
casino, said David Rockwell, an architect with Rockwellgroup who is helping
design the casino.
</P>
<P>
	   "It gives us the chance to create something that is much more than just a
casino," Rockwell said. "This is going to take it to a way, way different
level."
</P>
<P>
	   The Mohegans' casino will still be smaller than the Mashantucket's Foxwoods
Resort Casino, which opened in 1992. The Mohegan Sun has 280,000 square feet of
gambling space, compared with 315,310 square feet at Foxwoods. The new hotel
will have 1,200 rooms, while the grand hotel at Foxwoods has 1,416.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob DeSalvio, a vice president of marketing at Foxwoods Resort Casino, said
the Mashantuckets wish their neighbors well.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're firm believers that the project that they're putting forth is
actually very good for the region," DeSalvio said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sanctions Sudan Oil Venture  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has imposed economic sanctions
against an oil venture in war-torn Sudan after having determined that it is an
entity of the Sudanese government.
</P>
<P>
	   The action comes amid allegations that the Sudanese government has been
using oil revenues to help finance a civil war against rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, the Treasury Department announced Wednesday that sanctions
have been applied to Sudan's state-owned oil company Sudapet Ltd. and to the
Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Co. Ltd., a joint venture among Sudapet,
companies from China, Malaysia and Canada and the government of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   The action stems from what one Treasury official described as a routine
investigation. It means that U.S. individuals and companies are barred from
``engaging in most trade and financial transactions'' with Sudapet and Greater
Nile, Treasury said in a statement. It also means that any Sudapet and Greater
Nile assets within the possession or control of any U.S. individuals and
companies are frozen.
</P>
<P>
	   Doing business with these entities carries a criminal penalty of up to
$500,000 per violation for companies and up to $250,0000 for individuals and
also can carry a prison term of up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventures owned or controlled by the Sudanese government are subject to the
U.S. economic sanctions. In 1997, Clinton authorized a trade embargo against
Sudan and ordered all assets of the Sudanese government held in the United
States or by U.S. citizens to be frozen to protest Sudan's involvement in
terrorist activities and human rights violations, among other things.
</P>
<P>
	   State-owned China National Petroleum Corp, Malaysia's state-owned oil
company Petronas and Canada's Talisman Energy Corp. are foreign partners in
Greater Nile. Treasury officials said only these companies' investments in the
venture could potentially be affected by the sanctions but that would depend on
how their arrangements are structured.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the Canadian government decided not to apply sanctions against
Talisman for its involvement in Greater Nile.

<HEADLINE> Police officer cleared in shooting of teen-ager  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A white Hartford police officer was cleared
Wednesday of any state charges in the shooting of an unarmed black teen-ager,
but his legal entanglements are far from ended.
<P>
	   New London State's Attorney Kevin Kane, the special prosecutor who conducted
the 10-month investigation, said Officer Robert Allan reasonably believed that
he was in danger when he fired one shot at 14-year-old Aquan Salmon. The boy was
fleeing a car linked to an attempted mugging.
</P>
<P>
	   Kane's 200-page report has been turned over to the FBI's civil rights
division and the U.S. attorney for Connecticut. The city also is conducting its
own review.
</P>
<P>
	   Salmon's family would not comment. Allan could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a tragedy for (Salmon's) family, his friends and the entire
community," Kane told a news conference at the State Armory. "People chose sides
quickly, and hopefully they will pause and examine the facts presented in this
report today."
</P>
<P>
	   Some paused to pray. A dozen North End residents gathered near the shooting
site Wednesday afternoon to reflect near the remnants of a makeshift memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Cornell Lewis, pastor of the North End Church of Christ, led the
residents in prayer. Lewis, who is also a substance abuse and anger management
counselor, said people need to "vent" in a constructive way.
</P>
<P>
	   Kane and Public Safety Commissioner Henry Lee, a noted forensic expert,
outlined in detail the final minutes of Salmon's life, which ended in a dark,
debris-strewn lot on the city's North End.
</P>
<P>
	   Alone in his patrol car in the early morning hours of April 13, Allan was on
the lookout for a white Cadillac carrying suspects in a mugging. Witnesses
reported seeing four black males and two guns.
</P>
<P>
	   Allan spotted the car at 2:09 a.m. The Cadillac became hung up on a pile of
asphalt and the occupants began running from the car.
</P>
<P>
	   Allan, who said he thought he heard gunshots, gave chase. He said he saw
that the fleeing driver appeared to have a gun in his hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Two gun-shaped cigarette lighters were recovered, one on the front seat of
the Cadillac and the other in the lot where Salmon was shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Salmon, a back seat passenger, was among the last to leave the car. He
approached Allan from behind, and began running past him on the right.
</P>
<P>
	   The officer ordered Salmon to stop and said the teen made a quick sweeping
motion toward his waistband. Allan fired one shot. Salmon was struck in the
upper left side of his back.
</P>
<P>
	   Fewer than two minutes elapsed from the time Allan spotted the car to his
radio call for an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
	   "The shooting was over in a matter of seconds," said Kane. "To say the
situation Officer Allan was in was tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving is an
understatement."
</P>
<P>
	   Under state law, Kane said, Allan did not have to see Salmon with a weapon -
only to reasonably believe that his life was in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   Allan's account of hearing gunshots could not be substantiated. Lee
concluded there was enough debris in the lot that anyone running across it could
make popping sounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the report was made public, investigators discussed the findings with
Salmon's family and community officials. Outside that meeting, a small group of
protesters chanted, "No justice, no peace."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a lynching," said Kuba Assegai, a black businessman in the city. "We
want a police force who are there to serve the community, not bully the
community."
</P>
<P>
	   Allan has been on desk duty since the shooting. Acting Police Chief Deborah
Barrows would not comment on the report, but City Manager Saundra Kee-Borges
said Allan still faces a police review board and will remain on desk duty until
that probe is completed.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Mike Peters said deep wounds are still healing.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to take a look at our procedures, sensitivity training and how we
approach situations like this so it doesn't happen again," he said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Vows Ex-Iran Hostage Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright promised Wednesday
to help Americans held hostage for years in Lebanon find Iranian assets in the
United States that could be used to pay multimillion dollar judgments assessed
by U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's assurance came as the former State Department official in charge
of counter-terrorism during the 1980s kidnappings testified in federal court
that Iran ``with shrewdness and total ruthlessness'' orchestrated the kidnapping
of journalist Terry Anderson and other Westerners to put pressure on the Reagan
administration to sell it arms.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Oakley testified at a U.S. District Court hearing to determine the
size of the award Anderson -- the longest-held captive -- should receive. He
sued Iran for $100 million, and U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
found Iran in default on Tuesday because it failed to send any representatives.
</P>
<P>
	   After two days of testimony, Jackson took the case under consideration on
Wednesday. Anderson's lawyer, Stuart Newberger, said he hoped for a judgement
finding within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright, at a congressional hearing, expressed caution against confiscation
of Iranian diplomatic property that might prompt retaliation against U.S. assets
overseas. She indicated officials have yet to determine exactly what they can do
but said she would work with hostages and their families on what actions can be
taken to collect on the judgments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are trying to be of assistance in terms of how to resolve these
(claims) and we're prepared to work with these families to identify unblocked
Iranian assets to help satisfy the judgments they have received,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson said Albright's comments could lead to a major victory in allowing
hostages and their families to collect judgments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The chances are pretty good we can work something out with the
administration,'' said Anderson, who has been meeting with administration
officials and members of Congress on behalf of the Beirut hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   Although held in Lebanon, Anderson and his fellow former hostages contend
their capture was orchestrated by Iran. Anderson, former chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, was held in Beirut for nearly seven
years. He was released in 1991 after being held captive for 2,454 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Three other hostages held with Anderson in Beirut in the 1980s -- David
Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio and Frank Reed -- earlier won a $65 million judgment
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Both that suit and Anderson's were filed under a 1996 law that lets
Americans subjected to terrorism in foreign countries sue in U.S. courts if the
State Department lists those nations as sponsors of terrorism. Iran has been on
the list since 1984. So far, no money has been collected under the 1996 law
because it lacks an enforcement mechanism.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Anderson suit, Oakley testified that Iran was behind the kidnappings.
``The whole picture is very, very clearly visible,'' from the vantage point of
more than a decade later.
</P>
<P>
	   Oakley, in charge of the State Department's counter-terrorism program at the
time, cited ``a direct link'' between Iran and the hostages in Beirut. And it
paid off for Iran in terms of covert arms it was sold by the Reagan
administration in exchange for hostage releases as part of the Iran-contra
affair, Oakley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran-sponsored terrorist groups were able to flourish in Beirut because
Lebanon at the time was torn by civil war and essentially had no government,
Oakley said.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS News anchor Dan Rather said he felt ``deep and abiding stunned
disbelief'' upon learning of Anderson's kidnapping. ``I don't know anyone in
journalism who wasn't in one way or another intimidated by it,'' Rather
testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson, the judge, asked Rather if CBS had ever considered arming its
correspondents and other personnel in war zones like Beirut in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Rather called such an approach ``a bad idea...No serious consideration was
ever given to that.''

<HEADLINE> Putin Against Breakup of Monopolies  </HEADLINE>
    By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin declared Wednesday that he
strongly opposed breaking up the country's huge natural gas, electricity and
rail transport monopolies, and said management must look out for workers'
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Some reformers have suggested that the Soviet-era monopolies should be
divided into smaller enterprises and further privatized, but hard-liners and
centrists in Russia vehemently oppose those efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to a congress of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of
Russia, Putin said he, too, was against breaking up the gas giant Gazprom, the
Unified Energy System electric utility, and the Railways Ministry.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian leader's comments came in the wake of reports, later denied,
that Gazprom's management was considering shedding unprofitable activities. The
company owns a third of known world gas reserves and supplies a quarter of
Europe's gas.
</P>
<P>
	   The International Monetary Fund has asked Russia to separate gas transport
from gas production as a condition for renewed lending.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, State Property Minister Farit Gazizullin said the government
planned to sell 2.5 percent of Gazprom, but there was no word of a breakup.
German company Ruhrgas AG owns 3.5 percent of Gazprom outright and 0.5 percent
more through a joint venture with the Russian gas giant.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian government last year planned to sell 2.5 percent of Gazprom at a
minimum price of $660 million.
</P>
<P>
	   On the electric utility, Putin noted that "perhaps some elements within the
Unified Energy System are dragging the economy of the whole structure backward,
but there can be no talk whatsoever about its breakup," the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning to workers' rights, Putin said that employees of small- and
medium-sized enterprises were largely unprotected because of imperfect
legislation and because trade unions at that level were still embryonic. For
now, that put the burden of respecting workers' rights on management, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Business must get used to the idea that its leaders bear full
responsibility for the destiny of employees," Putin said. "It is impossible to
consider a market to be civilized when salaries aren't paid for months, while
enterprises are yielding profits."

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bank of NY Exec Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Bank of New York executive and her husband pleaded
guilty Wednesday to laundering billions of dollars from Russia in one of the
biggest such schemes in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
	   The pleas were the first major admissions of wrongdoing since the
investigation caused an international scandal last August and strained relations
between Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing side by side, Lucy Edwards, 41, and Peter Berlin, 46, each told a
federal judge how they used Edwards' position as a vice president in the bank's
Eastern European division to help Russian bankers launder more than $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators believe most of the money came from Russian importers trying
to avoid taxes, though they are looking into whether some came from Russian
mobsters. No one directly addressed the matter in court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But a prosecutor did say that $300,000 of the laundered money was ransom for
a kidnapping in Russia. And Edwards said the bankers she teamed up with in 1995
at the Russian bank DKB had some sinister connections.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was aware that personnel for DKB were on occasion in fear of their
customers and afraid to leave the bank because they said customers with machine
guns were waiting for them," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also said Russian banking officials were accomplices in the scam.
The administration of former President Boris Yeltsin has called the Bank of New
York allegations a creation by the West to tarnish Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards and Berlin, a Russian businessman, surrendered to the FBI on Tuesday
after flying to New York from London, where they had been living.
</P>
<P>
	   They could face up to 10 years in prison at sentencing May 3 but could get
lesser sentences by identifying others involved. They also agreed to surrender
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI's New York office, called
the pleas a significant development but said "much remains to be done" in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   T. Barry Kingham, an attorney for Edwards and Berlin, said the couple will
keep cooperating with investigators. "They are anxious to fulfill their
obligations here and resume a normal life," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dressed in black and smiling frequently during the hearing, Edwards
described creating an illegal banking network for Russians -- without required
licenses -- that was run through accounts at the Bank of New York. The Bank of
New York was not accused of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Money laundering involves moving deposits through a series of accounts to
disguise their illicit source. In this case, Edwards and her husband set up
accounts at Bank of New York for shell companies with offices in New York City
and Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank provided the companies with software that was then used by the
Russians to transfer money, cheating the Russian government out of customs
duties and tax revenue, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said she "suspected the accounts were being used by many people for
illicit purposes."
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange, Edwards and her husband were paid $1.8 million, a percentage of
the money being moved, she said. "We were paid substantial commissions for doing
very little work," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also said that after the couple moved to London in 1996, they paid a
Bank of New York employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, $500 a month to make sure the
accounts were operating properly.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev was indicted last month on perjury charges for allegedly lying
to a federal grand jury about whether she or her husband had ever received money
or loans from Edwards. Kudryavtsev's lawyer has said any money she received was
a product of her friendship with Edwards.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also admitted she used her position at the Bank of New York to help
hundreds of Russians, most of them affiliated with the Russian banking industry,
to enter the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy to commit money
laundering and operating an unlawful banking business. Each will remain free on
$500,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   An alleged accomplice in the money transfers, Aleskey Volkov, remains a
fugitive.

<HEADLINE> Play Depicts Loss, Romance in Cuba  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    An AP Entertainment Review By MICHAEL KUCHWARA AP Drama Critic
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite the stark political reality underlining "Two
Sisters and a Piano," there is a haunting, otherworldly quality to Nilo Cruz's
provocative new play about siblings under house arrest in Castro's Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   This ethereal drama, on view off-Broadway at the Public Theater, deals in
dreams and longing, attempts by older sister Maria Celia and the younger Sofia
to find a bit of happiness in the flirtatious visits of two men.
</P>
<P>
	   Maria Celia finds a lusty attraction to Lt. Portuondo, a military man who
comes to read letters to her. They are confiscated correspondence from her
political activist husband, now living in exile in Europe. It's a seductive
device that brings the two willful people together, at least for a moment or
two.
</P>
<P>
	   The impulsive, almost childlike Sofia has other designs. She desires Victor
Manuel, a tuner come to work on the piano in the women's decaying ancestral
home. Their relationship is playful, sweetly romantic, particularly on the part
of Sofia, an overly romantic girl.
</P>
<P>
	   Sofia is portrayed with a beguiling innocence by Daphne Rubin-Vega,
best-known as Mimi in the original cast of "Rent." Rubin-Vega has matured into a
fine actress, displaying a vulnerability here that immediately gets the audience
on her side.
</P>
<P>
	   Adriana Sevan plays Maria Celia with a fierce intelligence, getting across
that the woman is a successful writer who has been stymied by years of
incarceration, first in prison and then in her own home.
</P>
<P>
	   The men are less skillfully drawn, particularly the amorous military man, a
role that also suffers from Paul Caldero's wooden performance. Gary Perez has
more luck as the likable piano tuner.
</P>
<P>
	   Cruz's play saves its best moments for the interaction between the two
sisters. Their confinement is artfully drawn, an imprisonment of the mind as
well as the body. It's a fact underscored by designer Robert Brill's simple,
almost impressionistic setting -- the stuff of nightmares as well as pleasant
reveries.
</P>
<P>
	   The women bicker and even fight, but, for the most part, Cruz's language
approximates the poetic, conveying a sense of dreaminess that director Loretta
Greco captures in her delicate spinning of the story.
</P>
<P>
	   In one lovely moment in the second act, these two women dance together in an
almost defiant stance against their captors. It is a reminder that the chains by
which they are held can almost always be broken by imagination.

<HEADLINE> Restaurateur plans to reopen legendary Jersey Shore rock club  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ASBURY PARK, N.J. (AP) - Call it the club that would not die.
<P>
	   The Stone Pony, the legendary Jersey Shore rock club that spawned Bruce
Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Southside Johnny and others, may ride again.
</P>
<P>
	   Domenic Santana, who owns a restaurant in Jersey City, plans to buy the
shuttered rock mecca and reopen it on Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The club has been closed since 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana said he hopes Asbury Park will be revived by a proposed
redevelopment plan, and thinks the Stone Pony could be part of the comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Stone Pony, to me, is part of American nostalgia," said Santana, 37, of
Bayonne. "I'm really honored (to buy it), being a Cuban immigrant and growing up
and remembering Asbury Park as a kid, and seeing how rundown it has become."
</P>
<P>
	   The club opened in 1974, and provided a home for New Jersey musicians who
would later go on to worldwide fame. Springsteen regularly played there, as did
Southside Johnny, who named his band, The Asbury Jukes, after the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Other national acts that played the Stone Pony include The Kinks, Kiss,
Elvis Costello, Joan Jett, Hootie and the Blowfish and The Pretenders.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana plans to pay the club's current owners, Steven and Judy Nasar,
$375,000 for the building, its liquor license and the rights to the Stone Pony
name. The deal is set to close on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the building needs substantial work, including replacing a sagging
floor in danger of collapsing into the basement, Santana promises "to preserve
the dark dinginess that made the Stone Pony."

<HEADLINE> Defense rests in Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - After nine days of testimony, prosecutors asked a
judge on Wednesday to let a jury consider lesser charges against four police
officers accused of murdering Amadou Diallo.
<P>
	   Defense attorneys did not oppose the request to allow the jury to consider
manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in addition to the original
murder charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi reserved decision on the request, which
came moments after the defense rested. The judge denied a defense motion to
throw out the murder charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, Richard Murphy, 27, Sean Carroll, 37, and Edward McMellon,
27, have pleaded innocent to charges of intentional murder, depraved
indifference murder and reckless endangerment. If convicted of murder, they face
a maximum sentence of 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Teresi's ruling, the defense argued the original charges were too
severe. Attorney Bennett Epstein claimed the case marked the first time in state
history a depraved indifference charge had been brought against "police
officers, public servants, on duty on the streets of New York risking their
lives, who made a mistake."
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Eric Warner countered that the fact Diallo had been trapped and
killed by a "wall of lead" would "more than suggest depraved indifference to
human life."
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Worth, McMellon's attorney, said that the defense's decision to
acquiesce to the inclusion of lesser charges in no way changes their belief in
their clients' innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't concede for a moment that it's anything but not guilty," Worth
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors refused to say why they sought to include the lesser charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge adjourned the trial until Tuesday, when the jury will hear closing
arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the prosecution request, the alternatives to the intentional murder
charge would be first-degree manslaughter - intent to cause injury resulting in
death - which carries a maximum sentence of 12 1/2 to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
	   For depraved indifference, options would be second-degree manslaughter -
recklessly causing death - which carries a maximum sentence of 5 to 15 years, or
criminally negligent homicide - failing to perceive the risk of death - which
carries a maximum of 1 1/3 to 4 years.
</P>
<P>
	   A conviction on the murder charges or the first-degree manslaughter charge
would guarantee some jail time for the officers. The lesser charges allow for
probation.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense rested after its final witness, a police tactics expert who
consulted in the Rodney King case, testified the officers were right to charge
the vestibule where Diallo died.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was not only appropriate, it was really the job" of the four defendants
to pursue any suspicious person who ignores orders to halt, said James Fyfe, a
Temple University criminologist.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he is in fact a bad guy, things can only get worse once he's inside (an
occupied building)," Fyfe said. "You want to keep him away from innocent
people."
</P>
<P>
	   The defense expert - who had interviewed the four officers - said their
actions followed the New York Police Department's procedure and primary mission
of "preserving human life."
</P>
<P>
	   The officers testified they fired 41 bullets into the vestibule on Feb. 4,
1999 because the West African immigrant refused to stop for questioning,
retreated to his Bronx building and appeared to pull a gun; he was hit 19 times.
The black object turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution contends the officers never yelled any warnings before
cornering Diallo and opening fire. Backed by autopsy findings, prosecutors also
say most of the bullets hit Diallo while he was going down or flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
	   Fyfe, 58, a former NYPD lieutenant, told jurors he once consulted the Civil
Rights Division of the Justice Department in the police beating of King. He also
said he has testified in excessive force cases across the nation, mostly against
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge had ruled Fyfe could not testify about the actual shooting.
Prosecutors decided not cross-examine the witness, or put on a rebuttal case.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of an unarmed black man by four white officers resulted in
enough pretrial publicity and protests alleging widespread police abuse of
minorities that an appeals court decided to move the case to Albany. Before the
change of venue, attorneys had predicted the trial would last at least six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to reporters outside the courthouse, Diallo's mother criticized the
defense expert's findings.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not every black man on the street can be a suspect," said Kadiatou Diallo.
"If I was in the same situation, approached by four people in civil (civilian
clothes) in the middle of the night, I would run."

<HEADLINE> Norway FM Urges Sri Lanka Peace  </HEADLINE>
   By DILIP GANGULY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- As Norway's foreign minister arrived Wednesday to
broker talks aimed at ending Sri Lanka's 17-year civil war, fresh fighting
erupted, leaving at least 57 soldiers and guerrillas dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Knut Vollebaek met President Chandrika Kumaratunga at her heavily guarded
home in the capital as the Tamil Tiger rebels attacked government positions in
the north, killing seven soldiers, said the Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj.
J.D.A. Gunasekara. At least 14 rebels were killed when the army retaliated, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the rebels ambushed a police convoy in the eastern district of
Batticaloa, killing 13 policemen with rocket-propelled grenades, the defense
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   In six clashes Tuesday in the north, where most of Sri Lanka's 17-year-old
civil war has been fought, the army killed 23 rebels, Gunasekara said. He did
not mention government casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   The civil war has killed more than 61,000 people and displaced nearly 1.2
million since 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   The Norwegian initiative is the most serious international peace effort in
13 years, after India's abortive attempt in the late 1980s. Some 1,200 Indian
soldiers died trying to impose a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Reporters were banned from covering Vollebaek's meeting with Kumaratunga and
Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar. He also met with opposition leader Ranil
Wickremesinghe before returning to Norway.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The conflict in Sri Lanka can only be solved by political means. A basis
for dialogue must be established,'' Vollebaek said in a printed statement issued
in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am encouraged by the expressed willingness to seek a political solution.
However, this will take time. It will require courage and sacrifices and it will
require the necessary political will from the parties,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before coming to Sri Lanka, Vollebaek met with Anton Balasingham, the
London-based representative of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the
TamilNet Web site said Tuesday. The Web site, which often represents the LTTE
perspective, did not give the exact date of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Tamil Tiger sources say the guerrillas are expected to demand a military
pullout from Tamil majority areas as a precondition for peace talks. They also
want travel restrictions eased and food and other supplies delivered to the
area.
</P>
<P>
	   Kumaratunga proposes to amend the constitution to provide wide autonomy to
the eight provinces, including those in the north and east where most of Sri
Lanka's 3 million Tamils live, hoping to satisfy Tamil demands for self-rule.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels reject the autonomy plan, insisting on complete separation from
the Sinhalese dominated government.
</P>
<P>
	   Tamils, who have a distinct cultural identity and language, accuse the
Sinhalese majority of widespread discrimination in education and jobs.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Fight Navy in Puerto Rico  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's order to allow the Navy to resume
dropping inert bombs in Puerto Rico demonstrates a cavalier and undemocratic
disregard for residents who want the military to leave immediately, a delegation
of protesters charged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want the Navy out of there,'' said Carlos Zenon, a fishermen who has
organized demonstrations against the Navy. ``They could bomb Staten Island if
they want or Martha's Vineyard.''
</P>
<P>
	   At a press conference, Zenon and the other demonstrators promised to
continue protests and other acts of civil disobedience to stop the Navy from
firing dummy weapons on Vieques, a 51-square-mile island located eight miles off
Puerto Rico. The group met with lawmakers Wednesday and protested outside the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   At a separate press conference later in the day, Clinton was asked whether
he would be willing to use force to remove protesters who have acted as human
shields on the island. He didn't respond directly but said the people of Puerto
Rico should accept his directive as ``a perfectly reasonable compromise.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I still believe it is a good agreement,'' he said. ``I view this
compromise as an empowerment of the people of Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
	   For some 60 years, the Navy has occupied Vieques and bombed, shelled and
strafed it as a military training ground. The island's 9,400 residents are
sandwiched between a western zone where the military stores weapons in bunkers
and an eastern training ground where bombings, shellings and mock invasions are
staged.
</P>
<P>
	   After an errant bomb killed a civilian security guard and injured four
others last April, protesters moved in to act as human shields. The military
exercises were temporarily suspended, and Puerto Rico demanded the bombing range
be shut down.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Clinton reached a deal last month with Puerto Rico's Gov. Pedro
Rossello that allows the Navy to continue training for now, but only using inert
bombs. The agreement calls for a referendum, likely to be held in 2001, that
will give Vieques residents two choices:
</P>
<P>
	   --They can allow the Navy to resume use of the range on its own terms --
including the use of live bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   --Or they can require the Navy to cease all training by May 1, 2003. Until
then, however, the Navy could use the dummy bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   Most observers believe Vieques will vote to evict the Navy.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those protesting Wednesday was Mirta Sarta Rodriguez, the sister of
David Sanes Rodriguez, the 35-year-old security guard who died last April. She
wept as she talked about the loss of her brother.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want the Navy to leave Vieques once and for all,'' she said through a
translator.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters also claim the war games are responsible for a higher cancer
rate of 208 per 100,000 residents, almost double the Puerto Rican average.

<HEADLINE> Community unhappy, but not surprised, by exoneration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - In the impoverished North End neighborhood where
Aquan Salmon was killed, a dozen people gathered Wednesday for an impromptu
prayer.
<P>
	   They sought spiritual guidance - and expressed frustration that the white
police officer who killed the black, 14-year-old mugging suspect had been
cleared by a state investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's messed up how the cop got off, because he's only a kid. He's
somebody's brother; somebody's baby," said Carmen Melendez, who lives in the
neighborhood where Salmon was killed last April 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Melendez brought her 5-year-old daughter, Catalina, and her nieces and
nephews to what remains of a makeshift memorial to Salmon. Candles, a teddy
bear, broken statues and plastic flowers lay amid snow and mud. Spray-painted on
a brick wall were tributes to "Quanny."
</P>
<P>
	   "I came here with the children to do a prayer because they asked how he
died," said Melendez.
</P>
<P>
	   The children placed their palms together and bowed their heads as they
recalled a boy they never met.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Cornell Lewis, pastor of the North End Church of Christ, came to
the scene "just trying to find certain people and let certain people find me to
offer counseling."
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis led the group in prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I pray also, Father, in the days and months to come, that if Officer Robert
Allan is guilty that you judge him," said Lewis. "We pray, Father, in your
divine justice that you not let this man go if he is guilty."
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis and others were frustrated at being kept out of a meeting between
investigators and Salmon's family. Had they been allowed inside, they could have
shared the information with others, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're asking the community to act crazy because they're shutting them
out," said Wendy Moore. "They create a who's-who. Everybody should be a
who's-who. It makes a difference when people can learn it for themselves."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decries Smith FEC Nomination  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE RIZZO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Less than a week after choosing a controversial professor
for a seat on the Federal Election Commission, President Clinton said Wednesday
that he didn't want to do it.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Republicans, Clinton said, backed him into a corner by refusing to
consider anyone but Bradley A. Smith for a vacancy which, by law, must be filled
by a Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't like it ... but I decided that I should not shut down the whole
appointments process and depart from the plain intent of the law, which requires
that it be bipartisan and by all tradition, that the majority make the
nomination,'' Clinton told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott was so insistent on getting Smith
nominated that at one point last year he delayed confirmation of Richard
Holbrooke as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democratic candidates for president, Vice President Al Gore and Bill
Bradley, have condemned Smith's selection.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were right to condemn it, except that look at what the law says,''
Clinton said. ``The law says, A, this is a Republican appointment; and B, as a
practical matter, the way the appointments process works in the Senate ... the
majority leader always makes that recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton spent most of last year resisting making a Smith nomination and
soliciting alternate names from Lott.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lott and Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, who recruited Smith for the
post, held firm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a reason they wanted Bradley Smith on the FEC,'' Clinton said.
``You know, he hates campaign finance reform, Bradley Smith does. He's written
that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, who teaches at Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio, has
been a prominent critic of current campaign finance law.
</P>
<P>
	   He argues that it has failed to rid the system of corrupting influences
while unconstitutionally infringing on free speech, and says he would rather see
a system with no limits on how much candidates can raise and spend.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said that if confirmed by the Senate he would work within the law.
``Faithfulness to the statute and the Constitution will always be my guiding
principles,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, Gore urged the Senate to defeat the Smith nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   He was responding to Bradley's suggestions that forwarding Smith's name was
``a major retreat on fundamental campaign finance reform'' on the part of the
administration.

<HEADLINE> Judge orders Waterbury to release more water into river  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) - A Superior Court judge on Wednesday ordered the
city of Waterbury to release more water into the Shepaug River in a dispute that
pitted the city against environmentalists and two rural towns, officials said.
<P>
	   "I am very ecstatic and very pleased," said Roxbury First Selectman Barbara
Henry. "I think it is a victory for the Shepaug River Association and for all
the people who knew all along that there is plenty of water for everyone."
</P>
<P>
	   Conservationists from Roxbury and Washington sued the city in 1997, saying
Waterbury does not release enough water into the Shepaug River from an upstream
watershed.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit claimed that the city's actions affect the river, especially in
the summer when it dries to a trickle in some places. The river runs through the
towns of Warren, Washington and Roxbury before it empties into the Housatonic
River.
</P>
<P>
	   The city diverts water from the Shepaug watershed and pipes it to a
reservoir system closer to Waterbury. Without the Shepaug water, the city would
have to impose severe water restrictions in the summer, city attorneys have
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The city releases between 1.5 million and 5 million gallons of water into
the river each day, Hershey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Beverly Hodgson ordered Waterbury to release 34.3 million gallons a
day in May, 13.8 million gallons per day in June, 7.6 million in July, 6.5
million in August, 6.1 million in September and 9.8 million on October, Hershey
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a fight that was well worth fighting," she said."I think the river
is going to be much better off than when we started."
</P>
<P>
	   Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano said he was satisfied with the decision. He
said the city had offered a settlement that would have put even more water back
in the river.
</P>
<P>
	   "She also indicated that in extreme drought conditions those numbers would
not be required, and that was very important," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mohegans planning $800 million expansion to casino complex  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   UNCASVILLE, Conn. (AP) - The Mohegan Indians are planning an $800
million expansion to their casino complex, including a hotel, convention center,
shops and other amenities, the tribe said Wednesday.
<P>
	   The development is expected to create about 4,000 permanent jobs and
increase the Mohegan Sun's stature as a rival to the larger and older Foxwoods
Resort Casino, operated by the neighboring Mashantucket Pequots.
</P>
<P>
	   The construction is already underway and is expected to be completed by the
spring of 2002, said Michael Estess, executive vice president of marketing for
Mohegan Sun.
</P>
<P>
	   The $325 million Mohegan Sun opened in October 1996. It was originally built
without a hotel, which affected the amount of time people could stay at the
casino, Estess said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The hotel's going to create a whole new business for us in the meeting and
convention business," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The project will be funded with $360 million worth of high-yield bonds and a
loan from Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
	   By the numbers, the expansion plans include a 1,200-room hotel, 100,000
square feet of convention space with 30 meeting rooms and a 40,000-square-foot
ballroom.
</P>
<P>
	   The 40-story hotel tower will visible from Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribe also plans to built a 175,000-square-foot retail complex offering
brand-name merchandise, a 10,000-seat arena and 115,000 square feet of new
casino space, to accommodate 2,500 more slot machines and 75 more table games.
</P>
<P>
	   The old casino has an Earth-based theme, and the new addition will invoke
images of the sky.
</P>
<P>
	   A centerpiece of the expansion is a six-story alabaster tower with a
cocktail lounge and a planetarium dome with projections of the heavens.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, crystals and multicolored beads will reflect light around the new
casino, said David Rockwell, an architect with Rockwellgroup who is helping
design the casino.
</P>
<P>
	   "It gives us the chance to create something that is much more than just a
casino," Rockwell said. "This is going to take it to a way, way different
level."
</P>
<P>
	   The Mohegans' casino will still be smaller than the Mashantucket's Foxwoods
Resort Casino, which opened in 1992. The Mohegan Sun has 280,000 square feet of
gambling space, compared with 315,310 square feet at Foxwoods. The new hotel
will have 1,200 rooms, while the grand hotel at Foxwoods has 1,416.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob DeSalvio, a vice president of marketing at Foxwoods Resort Casino, said
the Mashantuckets wish their neighbors well.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're firm believers that the project that they're putting forth is
actually very good for the region," DeSalvio said.

<HEADLINE> ADDS 3 final grfs to UPDATE with comments from Reid's parents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Wednesday's report clearing a Hartford police
officer in the shooting of a teen-age suspect cemented public opinion on one
issue: The way such shootings are investigated must change.
<P>
	   Some relatives of the slain suspects feel that the police officer gets the
benefit of the doubt. Police officers and prosecutors, however, point to a case
in which a New Milford police officer was charged with murder after shooting a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   The families of the suspects say state's attorneys, state police and even
federal law enforcement cannot do a fair review of a local police department
shooting because of their professional ties to law enforcers.
</P>
<P>
	   "There needs to be some objectivity in the investigation," said Emma Jones,
the mother of Malik Jones, who was killed by an East Haven police officer in
April 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the only way to ensure fairness of all of the people involved, not
just for the families but for the police too," Jones said Wednesday. "As long as
they continue with the process that they have, there can never be any trust or
respect for the system."
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney John Kelly, who represents three police officers involved in fatal
shootings, said he believes the process is fair.
</P>
<P>
	   "Instead of just mouthing off, people ought to read the reports, let it sink
in and realize that these reports are very comprehensive, very detailed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelly represents Hartford Officer Robert Allan, who was cleared of
wrongdoing Wednesday in the April 13 shooting death of 14-year-old mugging
suspect Aquan Salmon.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelly also represents New Milford Officer Scott Smith, who faces a murder
trial next week for the December 1998 shooting of Franklyn Reid, and North
Branford Officer Michael Breen, who was cleared of wrongdoing last week in the
July shooting death of Victoria Cooper of West Haven.
</P>
<P>
	   "My position has always been that the state's attorney who conducts these
investigations knows the facts better than these critics," Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
	   But David Rosen, the lawyer for Cooper's family, said Breen was given two
weeks to write his report on Cooper's death, while police officers on other
cases must get a report together much more quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Breen also did not have to undergo questioning by supervisors or anyone else
about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   "The officer's given every opportunity to shape the story to the facts
instead of responding the way everyone else is asked to," Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jimmy Jones, Malik Jones' father, also said police officers should be
questioned and cross-examined after a fatal shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there is nothing for him or her to fear, then what's the problem here?"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Emma Jones said the state should go one step further and start a grand jury
investigation whenever police kill someone. The case should be led by federal
investigators who have no ties to Connecticut, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Malik Jones' case, East Haven Officer Robert Flodquist was cleared after
investigations by the New Haven state's attorney and the U.S. attorney for
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers are not always exonerated by shooting investigations. Waterbury
State's Attorney John Connelly noted that the process allows for a state's
attorney from a different judicial district to handle such cases. Connelly was
pulled in from Waterbury, in New Haven County, to investigate the Smith Case,
even though the crime occurred in New Milford, located in Litchfield County.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think police shootings should be investigated as any other crime - do it
just as thoroughly and objectively as possible. If you make exceptions for
police shootings, what other crimes do you make exceptions for?" Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reid's parents, Pearlylyn and Dwight Reid Sr., said they were pleased that
Connelly - an outside prosecutor - investigated the shooting of their son.
</P>
<P>
	   "We would have been upset if they had appointed a local investigator ...
because things probably would have been swept under the rug," Pearlylyn Reid
said.

<HEADLINE> Campbell Earnings Up 28 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Campbell Soup Co. on Wednesday reported a 28 percent
increase in fiscal second quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
	   The world's largest soup maker reported net earnings of $281 million, or 65
cents per share, for the period ending Jan. 30, up from $219 million, or 49
cents per share, over the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   That exceeded analysts' estimates by 3 cents a share, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales were up 5 percent, to $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our key priorities this year are to restore earnings growth and to invest
in innovation that will build our brands for the long term," said Dale F.
Morrison, the company's president and chief executive officer. "Our second
quarter results demonstrate progress on both fronts."
</P>
<P>
	   During the quarter, cash flow from continuing operations increased more than
100 percent from a year ago, to $465 million, and the company said it bought
back $128 million worth of its common stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of soup and sauces rose 7 percent to $1.4 billion, and worldwide wet
soup shipments increased by 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's ready-to-serve soups, led by Swanson broths and a
ready-to-serve tomato soup in a resealable plastic container, posted strong
sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell also said its Godiva Chocolatier division posted double-digit sales
and earnings growth, led by strong Christmas season sales in retail stores.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to its soup lines, Campbell's food brands include Pepperidge
Farm cookies and crackers, V8 juices and Prego sauces.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Campbell were unchanged from Tuesday, at $27.43 3/4, at 5:15 p.m.
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Are Mixed in Quiet Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term bond prices fell for a second straight day
Wednesday in quiet trading in advance of congressional testimony by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Shorter maturities were little changed.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/16 point, or $1.87 1/2 per
$1,000 in face value, after dropping $2.50 on Tuesday. The yield, which moves in
the opposite direction of price, rose to 6.26 percent from 6.24 percent Tuesday
and 6.22 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   A government report Wednesday morning of unusual strength in the housing
market -- despite rising interest rates -- added to inflation jitters. The Fed's
inflation fighters have raised rates four times since June, and traders expect
more increases ahead because of the economy's resilience.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to listening for clues from Greenspan's testimony Thursday to
the House Banking Committee, traders also are waiting for a report Thursday on
inflation at the wholesale level and a report Friday on consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
	   William Poole, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told
reporters Wednesday in Jonesboro, Ark., that the risk is that inflation will
rise.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a higher probability that the inflation rate might be a half
percentage point higher than there is a probability that the inflation rate
might be a half percentage point lower," he said in a question-and-answer
session following a speech at Arkansas State University on the agricultural
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities were up 1/32 point Wednesday, while
intermediate maturities were unchanged to up 1/16 point, according to Bridge
Telerate.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.72 percent, with the discount
dipping 0.01 percentage point from Tuesday to 5.56 percent. Six-month yields
were 5.98 percent as the discount fell 0.02 percent to 5.72 percent. One-year
yields were 6.18 percent, with the discount rising 0.02 percentage point to 5.83
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, fell
to 5.69 percent from 5.88 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds was unchanged at 92 5/32. The yield
to maturity of the index fell to 6.21 percent from Tuesday's 6.24 percent.

<HEADLINE> Drug Cos. Post Higher Profits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Operating profits increased last year for both Glaxo Wellcome
and SmithKline Beecham, the companies said Wednesday as they prepared to combine
to create the world's largest pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline Beecham showed the faster growth of the pair, its 1999 earnings
increasing by 13 percent. Glaxo Wellcome's annual earnings grew by 6 percent,
before a special charge to pay for restructuring costs reduced annual earnings
by 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're pretty much in line with our expectations," SG Securities analyst
Michael King said of the results.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies announced their annual results for the last time as individual
firms. London-based Glaxo agreed last month to buy SmithKline, which has
headquarters in London and Philadelphia, in a deal valued at $182.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined business, to be called Glaxo SmithKline, would have a 7.3
percent share of the global pharmaceutical market.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of Glaxo's antiviral drugs surged by 19 percent last year, accounting
for almost half of its $13.75 billion in annual sales, the company said. Two new
treatments for HIV, together with flu drug Relenza and the hepatitis B medicine
Zeffix, helped propel growth in this category.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of respiratory medicines increased by 11 percent, with the company's
best-seller, asthma drug Flixotide, generating sales of $1 billion. Drugs for
central nervous system ailments posted a 5 percent rise in sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Total annual sales were up 5 percent, at constant exchange rates, from the
previous year's level of $13.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo provides results by the half-year instead of by the quarter. Sales
accelerated 7 percent from the first half of the year to $7.10 billion in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's annual operating profit increased by 4 percent before inclusion of a
one-time restructuring charge of $319 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The one-time charge resulted in a 2 percent decrease in operating profit to
$4.25 billion, and a 1 percent drop in earnings to $2.93 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Second-half operating profit, adjusted to exclude the charge, rose by 6
percent over the first half of the year to $2.35 billion. Adjusted second-half
earnings increased by 9 percent to $1.65 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo did not report fourth-quarter results. British law does not require
companies to release profit and sales figures on a quarterly basis.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline reported a 13 percent increase in earnings for the year, buoyed
by strong sales in its prescription and over-the-counter medication sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug maker earned $603 million in the fourth quarter or 56 cents per
U.S. share, compared with $557 million or 51 cents per U.S. share in the
comparable quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter sales, at constant exchange rates, fell 2 percent to $3.65
billion from $3.84 billion. The drop resulted from the sale of several
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year 1999, SmithKline earned $2.3 billion, compared with $2.08
billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Annual sales were up 3 percent to $13.58 billion from $13.42 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmaceutical sales grew 12 percent in 1999, fed by the continued strength
of the antidepressant Paxil and the antibiotic Augmentin.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer health care sales rose 6 percent for the year. SmithKline makes
Nicorette gum and NicoDerm CQ, a patch designed to help smokers quit.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. shares of SmithKline fell $2.25 to $53.62 1/2 in trading at 4:30 p.m.
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> MTV, 'Ripley' Lift Viacom Earnings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc. reported a sharp rise in its fourth-quarter
earnings Wednesday, driven by growth in its MTV and VH1 cable television
networks and box office receipts.
</P>
<P>
	   Viacom earned $133.1 million, or 19 cents per share, in the last three
months of 1999 compared to $18.5 million, or 5 cents a share, a year ago, when
results were dragged down by a one-time loss of $74.7 million. Without the loss
and other extraordinary factors, the year-ago earnings were $89.8 million, or 15
cents per share, meaning this year's results were up 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings edged analysts' expectations of 14 cents a share, as reported
by First Call/Thomson Financial, but the company's stock slipped $3.25 to $55.93
3/4 in trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue rose 7 percent to $3.57 billion from $3.34 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In a conference call with analysts, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone cited
growth at MTV and VH1 as well as revenues from movie hits such as "The Talented
Mr. Ripley," "Sleepy Hollow" and "Double Jeopardy" for the jump in earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   The report came a day after Viacom's merger partner, CBS Corp., also
reported robust fourth-quarter results. The merger has been approved by
shareholders at both companies and is expected to be completed in March or
April.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are extremely optimistic about where we are and where we are going with
CBS," Redstone said.
</P>
<P>
	   MTV revenues rose 17 percent on gains in advertising, while television
earnings were driven higher by "Frasier," "JAG" and "7th Heaven." Viacom's
Blockbuster video subsidiary posted a 10 percent rise in revenues and spent more
to beef up its Internet business.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, Viacom reported net earnings of $321.6 million, or 45
cents per share, compared to a loss of $149.6 billion, or 21 cents per share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 6 percent percent to $12.86 billion from $12.10
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to its widely-known cable brands MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon,
Viacom also owns the Paramount movie and television studios, the Simon &AMP;
Schuster publishing house, and half of the UPN and Comedy Central networks.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rejects Ending Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton rejected calls for a national
moratorium on capital punishment Wednesday but urged the nation's governors to
``look very closely'' at their death penalty systems to make sure that innocent
people are not executed.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it was courageous of Illinois Gov. George Ryan to impose a freeze on
executions after the exoneration of 13 death row inmates in his state over two
decades. Clinton said death penalty supporters -- including himself -- have ``an
especially heavy obligation'' to make sure there is no question of guilt for
condemned prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   At an hourlong news conference ranging from domestic subjects to foreign
policy, Clinton refused to say whether he will challenge ethics complaints
seeking to strip him of his Arkansas law license because of his conduct in the
Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he paid $850,000 last year to settle a related case -- the sexual
harassment suit of Paula Jones -- only to prevent it from being a distraction to
his presidency. He said the suit ``had absolutely no merit.''
</P>
<P>
	   On another subject, Clinton said he has not ruled out a visit to Pakistan
next month when he visits its arch rival, India. He said his decision would
hinge on whether stopping in Islamabad could stop the regional arms race,
promote democracy in military-ruled Pakistan and resolve the India-Pakistan
conflict. He said the United States would be happy to help mediate the dispute
over Kashmir, but only if both countries seek help.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon striding into the East Room for his first regular news conference of
the year, Clinton announced the release of $125 million in federal money to help
needy families buy home heating oil in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also said he would seek $600 million in emergency funds to
deal with the current crisis and problems likely to occur later this year in
areas suffering from extreme heat. Clinton said he is restricted by law from
tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to moderate fuel prices, but added,
``I have not ruled out any action.''
</P>
<P>
	   The idea of a death penalty moratorium has gathered momentum since Gov. Ryan
took the unprecedented step Jan. 31 of putting all executions on hold in
Illinois, saying that the state's system was ``fraught with error.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before that, the American Bar Association had called for a death penalty
moratorium. Last week, Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., urged Clinton to suspend
federal executions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the federal cases, I don't believe it is called for,'' the president
said. He said 27 people have been condemned under federal law, 20 in civilian
courts and seven through the military system.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Justice Department is reviewing whether the death penalty is
being imposed fairly from a racial standpoint, and is drawing up guidelines to
make it easier for prisoners to pursue clemency requests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that if I were a governor still, I would look very closely at the
situation in my state and decide what the facts are,'' said Clinton. As
governor, he signed four execution authorizations.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also said he was inclined to support a measure by Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., on capital punishment. It provides for DNA testing of inmates who
seek to prove they did not commit the crime for which they were condemned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Would I sleep better at night if it were law?'' Clinton said. ``If it
would really work, I would. In other words, I am favorably disposed toward it.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said that Ryan ``did the right thing'' in ordering a state moratorium on
executions, particularly since ``a majority of the American people support
capital punishment, as do I.''
</P>
<P>
	   On other subjects, Clinton:
</P>
<P>
	   --Said Republican presidential hopefuls John McCain and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas have ``got a tough job'' in running against the Clinton record of peace
and prosperity. ``I have a lot of sympathy with them,'' he said, a day after
sharp criticism from Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   --Said that Democratic rivals Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore were
``right to condemn'' Clinton's nomination of Republican Bradley Smith to the
Federal Election Commission. Clinton said that Smith ``hates campaign finance''
legislation but that he nominated him anyway simply to fill a Republican
vacancy, and Smith was the candidate favored by Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   --Refused to cast blame for the deepening crisis in the Northern Ireland
peace process. ``I don't think you can Monday morning quarterback that,'' the
president said. He said that the current crisis was ``a very unfortunate
development'' but that the IRA ``has given no indication whatever that they will
revert to violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And so that means that they still think, no matter what the rhetoric says,
that all the parties really believe that they ought to find a way to work this
out.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bank of NY Exec Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Bank of New York executive and her husband pleaded
guilty Wednesday to laundering billions of dollars for crooked Russians in one
of the biggest such schemes in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
	   The pleas were the first major admissions of wrongdoing since the
investigation caused an international scandal last August and strained relations
between Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing side by side, Lucy Edwards, 41, and Peter Berlin, 46, each told a
federal judge how they used Edwards' position as a vice president in the bank's
Eastern European division to help Russian bankers launder more than $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators believe most of the money came from Russian importers trying
to avoid taxes, though they are looking into whether some came from Russian
mobsters. No one directly addressed the matter in court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But a prosecutor did say that $300,000 of the laundered money was ransom for
a kidnapping in Russia. And Edwards said the bankers she teamed up with in 1995
at the Russian bank DKB had some sinister connections.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was aware that personnel for DKB were on occasion in fear of their
customers and afraid to leave the bank because they said customers with machine
guns were waiting for them," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also said Russian banking officials were accomplices in the scam.
The administration of former President Boris Yeltsin has called the Bank of New
York allegations a creation by the West to tarnish Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards and Berlin, a Russian businessman, surrendered to the FBI on Tuesday
after flying to New York from London, where they had been living.
</P>
<P>
	   They could face up to 10 years in prison at sentencing May 3 but could get
lesser sentences by identifying others involved. They also agreed to surrender
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI's New York office, called
the pleas a significant development but said "much remains to be done" in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   T. Barry Kingham, an attorney for Edwards and Berlin, said the couple will
keep cooperating with investigators. "They are anxious to fulfill their
obligations here and resume a normal life," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dressed in black and smiling frequently during the hearing, Edwards
described creating an illegal banking network for Russians -- without required
licenses -- that was run through accounts at the Bank of New York. The Bank of
New York was not accused of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Money laundering involves moving deposits through a series of accounts to
disguise their illicit source. In this case, Edwards and her husband set up
accounts at Bank of New York for shell companies with offices in New York City
and Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank provided the companies with software that was then used by the
Russians to transfer money, cheating the Russian government out of customs
duties and tax revenue, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said she "suspected the accounts were being used by many people for
illicit purposes."
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange, Edwards and her husband were paid $1.8 million, a percentage of
the money being moved, she said. "We were paid substantial commissions for doing
very little work," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also said that after the couple moved to London in 1996, they paid a
Bank of New York employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, $500 a month to make sure the
accounts were operating properly.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev was indicted last month on perjury charges for allegedly lying
to a federal grand jury about whether she or her husband had ever received money
or loans from Edwards. Kudryavtsev's lawyer has said any money she received was
a product of her friendship with Edwards.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also admitted she used her position at the Bank of New York to help
hundreds of Russians, most of them affiliated with the Russian banking industry,
to enter the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy to commit money
laundering and operating an unlawful banking business. Each will remain free on
$500,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   An alleged accomplice in the money transfers, Aleskey Volkov, remains a
fugitive.

<HEADLINE> Test scores drop in poor high schools, while state changes the way  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Even as the state is pumping hundreds of millions
more into poor school districts, test scores in these high schools dropped over
four years, according to school report cards released Wednesday.
<P>
	   The report cards show test scores falling in 86 percent of the high schools
in "special needs" districts, from April 1996 to April 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Only six of 43 schools saw an increase. One school - McNair Academy, a
Jersey City magnet school - saw no change, 100 percent of students passed the
tests in both years.
</P>
<P>
	   Under order from the state Supreme Court, the state has pumped $729 million
more into these districts since the 1997 school year.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with test scores falling, parents who give the report cards a quick
glance might think their schools are doing better.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Department of Education changed the way it reports the high school
proficiency test scores.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey high-schoolers get four shots at taking the HSPT, which they must
pass in order to graduate. They first take the test in October of their junior
year and, if they fail, they take it again in April.
</P>
<P>
	   The same test schedule applies to senior year, for students who fail both
times in 11th grade.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past four years, the department has highlighted on the report card
the scores for the first round of tests. This year, state officials decided to
highlight the cumulative number of students who passed both the first and second
administration of the tests.
</P>
<P>
	   In some districts, especially poor urban ones, that drives up the scores
considerably.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, in Jersey City's Snyder High School, 16.2 percent of students
passed the test the first time, compared to a cumulative total of 33.3 percent
after the second test was administered. In Long Branch, 55.4 percent of students
passed in October, compared to 74.7 percent in April. Some schools show narrower
gains, such as Science High School in Newark, a magnet school, which posted 91.7
percent students passing in October, compared to 97.5 in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Education Department spokesman Peter Peretzman said the scores for both
October and April are on the report card. They're just packaged differently.
</P>
<P>
	   A table that used to contain only October scores now shows the higher
cumulative score from the October and April tests. A graph shows the separate
scores from both administrations of the test, but may be more difficult to
understand than the table.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeanne Allen, president of the Center for Education Reform in Washington,
D.C., said the change could prevent parents from understanding how well their
schools are faring and the state from taking an honest look at what these
schools need.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't necessarily tell you those schools are doing any better unless
they can provide data that says that in each October the kids have improved at
that first administration of the test, over five years," said Allen,
</P>
<P>
	   "This is about making sure our kids are learning," she added. "This isn't
about making sure someone is covering their behind and that's what it sounds
like, to a certain extent, is happening."
</P>
<P>
	   But Steve Block, lawyer for the Education Law Center, which represents poor
students in the 30-year-old school funding court case, said using the second
test administration is better.
</P>
<P>
	   "We ought to know how many kids pass in a given year, whether they take it
in April or October," said Block.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the prettier packaging, a comparison of scores shows nearly all of
these failing high schools doing even worse.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest loser was Camden High School, which saw scores drop nearly 25
points from 72.4 percent passing in April 1996 to 47.5 percent in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Asbury Park High also lost considerable ground, dropping about 20 percentage
points from 75 to 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Woodrow Wilson High School in Camden and Weequahic in Newark also saw
significant declines, dropping about 19 percentage points and 23 points,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the six schools that saw improvements, New Brunswick posted the biggest
gain, going from 61.9 percent in 1996 to 74.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Bridgeton was next highest, with a 4.2 point increase, while the other four
- Newark Central High, Snyder in Jersey City, Elizabeth and Garfield - all
posted gains of less than 1 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
	   "Money alone doesn't improve education," said Peretzman. "Although clearly,
we made a substantial financial commitment and we'd like to see better results."
</P>
<P>
	   Peretzman also noted that reforms are just getting underway in these
districts. And, test scores are just one measure of a school's success. The
report cards also offer other data, including dropout rates, SAT scores and
attendance.
</P>
<P>
	   The state is under state Supreme Court order to help districts overhaul
elementary schools, a process known as whole school reform. Districts are also
supposed to create public preschools and make a raft of other reforms, with the
state's help.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 156.68  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in volatile trading Wednesday as
blue-chip issues, falling victim once again to investor worries about interest
rates, ended a two-day rally. Technology stocks managed a slim advance.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 156.68 to close at 10,561.41, wiping
out more than half of a 292-point gain in the past two sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 14.38 to
1,387.67, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 6.88 to 4,427.65.
</P>
<P>
	   American Express led the Dow lower, tumbling 5 9/32 to 153 27/32 as
investors guessed it would be among the stocks to suffer if the Federal Reserve
continues raising interest rates to force a slowdown in the U.S. economy. In an
effort to keep inflation under control, the Fed has raised rates four times
since last June.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the Fed has received little evidence that higher rates are working,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The U.S. economy doesn't seem to be slowing down at all," said Alan
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. "Stocks
continue to climb a wall of worry over higher interest rates."
</P>
<P>
	   The latest signs of a booming economy came Wednesday from the Commerce
Department, which reported housing construction soared in January despite a
spike in mortgage rates. Also, crude oil futures hovered around $30 per barrel,
the highest prices since Jan. 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   "The combination of higher interest rates and rising oil prices could be a
combustible combination that will cause the market to work its way lower for a
while," Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Dow components that faltered included Coca-Cola, Procter &AMP; Gamble and
Home Depot. Coke fell 2 1/8 to 53 9/16; Procter &AMP; Gamble lost 1 45/64 to 94 3/64
and Home Depot fell 3 to 56 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   For most of the session, technology stocks appeared poised to bounce back
from three sessions of weakness brought on by profit-taking. The Nasdaq,
dominated by technology, rose as much as 56 points before trailing off in late
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Applied Materials rose 6 7/8 to 173 3/8 after announcing
stronger-than-expected profits and a robust outlook for the coming year. The
company, a leading maker of chip-manufacturing equipment, earned 80 cents per
share in its most recent quarter, topping analysts' estimates by three cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Applied Materials also announced it will split its shares two-for-one
effective March 15. The broader semiconductor sector rose on Applied Materials'
report of strong customer demand; LSI Logic rose 7 1/2 to 104.
</P>
<P>
	   Lycos, maker of a popular Internet search engine, rose 3 9/16 to 72 5/8. The
company said late Tuesday it earned 3 cents per share in its fiscal second
quarter, beating analysts' estimates of 1 cent per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the Nasdaq is showing some signs of profit-taking. The index
has risen 8.6 percent so far this year, compared with an 8.1 percent decline by
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had some marvelous advances, but then investors get into this backing
and filling stage where fear takes over," said Michael Farr, president of Farr,
Miller &AMP; Washington, a Washington, D.C.-based financial consulting firm.
"Ultimately, I think tech will continue to lead the market, but it may
struggle."
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan will address the House Banking
Committee. Analysts said investors will listen carefully to his testimony on the
state of the economy, seeking clues to the Fed's sentiment.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled 1.23 billion shares, compared with
1.31 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.52 to 547.76.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.2 percent. Germany's Xetra DAX
index rose 1.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained 2.4 percent, and France's
CAC-40 fell 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet May Have Brain Damage  </HEADLINE>
   By CIARAN GILES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- A British medical report on Augusto Pinochet says
brain damage is eroding the former Chilean dictator's memory, and has left him
mentally unfit to stand trial, two Spanish newspapers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspapers, which claimed to have obtained copies of the report, said it
suggested the 84-year-old general might not be able to remember many details of
his 17-year rule. It also suggested he could have trouble answering questions
and following proceedings if tried on charges of human rights abuse, as sought
by a Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABC and El Mundo dailies said records from a January exam by British
doctors show Pinochet suffers a condition known as peripheral diabetic
neuropathy, as well as progressive cerebrovascular damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The papers published what they said were translations of excerpts from the
records a day after England's High Court ordered British Home Secretary Jack
Straw to hand the medical report to Spain and three other countries seeking
Pinochet's extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw has said that, based on this report, he is inclined to send Pinochet
home to Chile rather than to Spain for trial.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, Pinochet's lawyers said they would pursue legal action after the
apparent leak of the report.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The court made it clear that the medical report was to be disclosed only
to Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland on a confidential basis, and that the
senator's right to privacy was to be respected,'' Michael Caplan, of the legal
firm Kingsley Napley, said in a statement. ``Within hours of the judgment, there
has been a clear breach of the court order.''
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's Home Office, which handles extradition cases, asked Spain to
investigate the leak of the report. The Spanish government denied any
involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Alastair Campbell, the spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, described the leak as ``regrettable'' and said his government had handed
over the exam results in confidence.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spanish newspapers did not say how they obtained copies of the report.
But a source close to the Spanish judge seeking Pinochet's extradition said he
had been told that both the Chilean and Spanish governments had leaked the
report because it appeared to favor both governments' argument that Pinochet
should be released.
</P>
<P>
	   A Chilean newspaper, La Tercera, said on its Web site that the Chilean
government had provided it with excerpts of the doctors' report. But in its
printed edition, La Tercera omitted any mention of having received the report
from the government, and cited only the Spanish newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   Chile's acting Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez said the Chilean
government ``has no idea'' who leaked the medical report.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet is appealing an extradition request issued by Spanish Judge
Baltasar Garzon, who wants him to stand trial for human rights abuses committed
during his 1973-90 dictatorship. A Chilean government report says 3,197 people
died or disappeared after Pinochet ousted elected Marxist president Salvador
Allende.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet was arrested in October 1998 on a Spanish warrant while
recuperating from back surgery in a London hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the two Spanish papers, the British doctors declared Pinochet
physically fit to stand trial. But his brain has continued to deteriorate
despite treatment, and both his physical and mental condition are likely to
worsen.
</P>
<P>
	   El Mundo quoted the report as saying Pinochet's condition seriously
deteriorated last September and October.
</P>
<P>
	   In Paris, the families of three French citizens who disappeared under the
Pinochet's rule said that, having read the medical report, they believed he was
well enough to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The report shows that Pinochet is not ``a senile man,'' the families'
lawyer, William Bourdon, said in a statement. ``The health problems he has are
not incompatible with his appearance before the judges.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the families were asking the French government to demand Straw
renounce all decisions to repatriate the former dictator.

on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's earnings rose 27 percent in the fourth quarter and 47 percent
for fiscal year 1999. But Abercrombie, a retailer of clothing geared toward
teen-agers and young adults, said same-store sales grew less than anticipated,
prompting several brokerages to cut their ratings on the stock.

</P>
<P>
	   BCE Inc., a Montreal telecommunications conglomerate, has made a bid for
Teleglobe that values the company at about $33.25 per share, a discount to its
recent stock price. Teleglobe also posted fourth-quarter earnings that missed
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The company earned 51 cents per share in its fiscal first quarter, up from
15 cents per share in the first quarter of 1999. Hadco makes electronic
interconnection products.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Tuesday, the company reported second-quarter operating profits of 3
cents a share, beating analysts' forecasts of 1 cent per share. Lycos said
strong sales from electronic commerce helped boost results.

<HEADLINE> State takes over fire inspections at Seton Hall, finds violations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - The state took over fire inspections at Seton
Hall University this month and has since found a number of fire code violations
on campus, including in the freshman dormitory where three students were killed
in January, officials said Wednesday.
<P>
	   Violations at Boland Hall included unauthorized use of Christmas lights and
extension cords and excessive trash in dorm rooms, said Bill Cane, director of
the state Division of Fire Safety. He said there were some more serious
violations, but would not specify what they were.
</P>
<P>
	   The state stripped the South Orange Fire Department of its annual fire
inspection duties at Seton Hall on Feb. 3, Cane said, after his inspectors found
violations and after he was unable to get access to complete inspection records.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a lack of confidence that the inspections in previous years had
occurred," Cane said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cane said his examination of South Orange documents did not find any records
of annual fire inspections from 1995 on. South Orange is required by law to
inspect the campus for fire violations once a year.
</P>
<P>
	   But records released by South Orange on Wednesday and reviewed by The
Associated Press showed records of annual campus inspections from 1989 through
1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Township officials said South Orange last inspected the campus for fire
violations on Oct. 22, 1998, but did not file a report because no violations
were found. The university had hired a consultant to fix any violations before
the 1998 inspection, said township attorney Edwin A. Matthews.
</P>
<P>
	   Cane said a report should have been filed anyway. "I would have expected to
see more records than we have seen," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The last violations reported at Boland Hall were on Jan. 9, 1997, according
to the reports. South Orange officials cited the dormitory for a missing sign
outside a standpipe, ordered the sealing of a hole in the roof of a trash room
and said one fire detector had to be secured.
</P>
<P>
	   Matthews said all violations detected on campus were corrected within two
weeks, but the reports did not mention that.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall has been criticized for its fire safety plans since the Jan. 19
blaze in a third-floor lounge killed three freshmen and injured 62 other people.
Four students remain hospitalized for treatment of burns.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the fire is under investigation, but students and state
officials initially questioned why Boland Hall was not equipped with sprinklers
and why the university didn't conduct regular fire drills.
</P>
<P>
	   The university last month said it would install sprinklers in all of its six
dormitories, and several bills are before the state Legislature that would
require colleges statewide to install sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
	   The records released by South Orange on Wednesday did not include reports on
fire drills, which are required by law to be held twice a year. South Orange
officials said Seton Hall University was not required to provide those records
to the township.
</P>
<P>
	   University officials refused to answer questions on Cane's remarks about
violations found at Boland Hall. The school released a statement saying all of
its six residence halls "meet building codes and all are safe."
</P>
<P>
	   Cane said the state's inspections of all buildings at the university found
several violations, but none that would constitute an "imminent hazard." He said
the inspections would be complete by next week.
</P>
<P>
	   South Orange officials said they were unaware of current violations at
Boland Hall. Most of the 640 freshmen displaced by the fire have returned to the
dorm.
</P>
<P>
	   South Orange released inspection records after two newspapers sued to obtain
access to them. Essex County prosecutors investigating the fire had ordered them
sealed, saying they were part of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   But prosecutors dropped their objection to releasing the records at a
hearing on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Normal China Trade  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton pledged to push for a quick vote on
granting China normal trade relations while his top trade negotiator told
Congress on Wednesday that rejection of the effort would be ``devastating'' to
U.S.-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe this agreement will change China from within more than all the
other economic opening of the last 20 years combined,'' Clinton said at a White
House news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a sign of what is shaping up as one of the biggest legislative fights
this year, labor leaders announced they would begin running a ``No blank check
for China'' television and radio ad campaign next week, starting in about a
dozen House districts in an effort to convince wavering lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   While U.S. businesses and farm groups lobby in support of a measure they
believe will boost their export sales by billions of dollars in the world's
largest market, opponents argue the deal is bad for U.S. workers and will allow
more U.S. corporations to locate facilities in China to take advantage of cheap
labor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The vote over normal trade relations with China is a vote over whether to
accelerate the global race to the bottom,'' AFL-CIO President John Sweeney told
reporters at the labor group's winter meeting in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   Those opposing the elimination of the annual vote in Congress on China's
trade status argue that it will take away their leverage to influence China's
policies in such areas as human rights and religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   China agreed to drop high barriers to U.S. products as part of its bid to
win membership in the 135-member World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based body
that sets the rules for global trade.
</P>
<P>
	   However, administration officials say that U.S. exporters won't gain the
full benefits of China's trade offers until Congress eliminates the annual
review of China's trade status and permanently grants China the same low tariffs
enjoyed by all other WTO members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am going to push for this as hard as I can, I want to get the earliest
possible vote I can and I can't tell you how important I think it is,'' Clinton
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to a reporter's question, Clinton ruled out the possibility of
continuing to require an annual review of China's trading status. Clinton said
the United States has to grant the permanent trading privileges to China for
American businesses to benefit from China's market-opening offers.
</P>
<P>
	   However, opponents have raised questions about this stance.
</P>
<P>
	   Lori Wallach, head of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, said that a 1979
bilateral trade agreement with China requires that country to grant the United
States the lowest tariffs it grants other countries, a provision she said will
still be in force once China gains WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, the administration's leadoff
witness in the congressional lobbying campaign, told the House Ways and Means
Committee on Wednesday that a negative vote would be ``quite devastating'' in
terms of U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
	   She said it would be a slap in the face for economic reformers inside China
who pushed for the communist leadership to grant more concessions in the trade
deal the administration and China concluded last November after 14 years of
arduous negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   The China vote is likely to be the last big trade battle of the Clinton
presidency. The administration was embarrassed last December when an effort to
launch a new round of global talks failed in Seattle when trade ministers from
135 nations could not agree on a negotiating agenda. The administration had
pushed for the new negotiations to include discussions of ways to protect worker
rights and the environment, something developing countries strongly resisted.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., unveiled a set of proposals Wednesday which he
said might serve as a framework for picking up undecided lawmakers. Among
Levin's suggestions was creating a new commission with a full-time staff to
monitor China's adherence to international standards in such areas as human
rights and labor standards and submit a report to Congress each year.
</P>
<P>
	   While Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee praised the proposal, it
was unclear whether it would gain any support among labor unions.

<HEADLINE> Snow causes a little havoc for the Inaugural Winter Goodwill Games  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) - The only thing needed for most winter sports
threatened on Wednesday to create a little havoc for the inaugural Winter
Goodwill Games - snow. Too much of it.
<P>
	   Nearly two feet has slammed the area around this picturesque Adirondack
Mountain village since Monday. That, and bank after bank of low-hanging clouds
forced officials to cancel downhill training on Wednesday for the second
straight day because of poor visibility.
</P>
<P>
	   "We kept saying in November and December, when we were begging for it, where
is it, where's the snow?" said Sandy Caligiore, media relations director for the
New York State Olympic Regional Development Authority (ORDA), which operates the
winter sports venues in the region. "Then we said, 'We know when it's coming.'
And sure enough, that's when it came."
</P>
<P>
	   Four days of competition begin Thursday in luge, skeleton, bobsled, figure
skating, short track speedskating, snowboarding, cross-country skiing, nordic
combined, ski jumping, freestyle skiing and alpine skiing.
</P>
<P>
	   More snow was predicted for Friday and Saturday, and there was no room to
push back the downhill races, which carry the top first-place prize of $20,000.
</P>
<P>
	   But like all winter sports hosts, and having hosted two Winter Olympics,
Lake Placid was ready for whatever Mother Nature had in store.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are contingency plans," ORDA president Ted Blazer said. "We're in the
business of putting on world events, and we will make it happen."
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100 workers - and a few athletes - were busy carting snow off the
skiing and snowboard venues at Whiteface Mountain. Crews also were busy sweeping
off and grooming the new bobsled-luge-skeleton track at Mount Van Hoevenberg.
</P>
<P>
	   "The snow has affected practicing," said snowboarder Rob Kingwill, who also
had to cope with the brief loss of the U.S. team's equipment on the way here
from Lake Tahoe. "But we're pretty excited to be here."
</P>
<P>
	   Blazer said more than 40,000 tickets had been sold as of Wednesday. Figure
skating, which will feature such former Olympic stars as Nancy Kerrigan,
Katarina Witt, Dorothy Hamill, Oksana Baiul and Victor Petrenko, was commanding
the most attention. Saturday night's finals already were close to a sellout, but
organizers were hoping for strong walkup sales for all events.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Villagers skeptical of safety claim after steam release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) - The steam was barely radioactive, its escape from
the Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor "momentary and minuscule," officials said.
There was no health danger, no need to warn nearby residents, no reason to keep
the kids home from school.
<P>
	   But some people living in the shadow of Indian Point said Wednesday that
they should have been let in on Tuesday night's accident, the most serious in
the 26-year history of the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   "Where were the sirens?" asked David Coviello, 55, who lives two doors from
the plant gate. "I have a 7-year-old son, an 18-year-old daughter."
</P>
<P>
	   Salvatore Simone said officials should notify residents of any accident,
regardless of its seriousness. "I should decide for myself," he said. "I might
have gotten into the car with my family and gotten away."
</P>
<P>
	   The sirens kept still because officials in four counties agreed that there
was no reason to set them off, said Westchester's deputy county executive, Jay
Hashmall, stepping in for County Executive Andrew Spano. Spano went to Los
Angeles Wednesday morning, coincidentally to examine that city's emergency
operations center.
</P>
<P>
	   Guidelines from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission "call for the sounding of
sirens only when some protective action is needed," such as evacuations or
stay-inside orders, Hashmall said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said no such measures were needed because the radioactivity
released was "completely unmeasurable," said Con Ed Vice President Steve Quinn.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Con Ed declared an alert, a first for the plant, which is on
the Hudson River about 35 miles north of Times Square and has 15.5 million
people within a 50-mile radius. An alert is one of four categories of nuclear
events identified by the NRC. In order from least serious to most serious they
are: unusual event, alert, site area emergency and general emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   The only general emergency at a U.S. nuclear plant was the March 1979
accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Mindy Landau of the NRC said there are an average of three or four alerts a
year among the nation's 103 operating reactors.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday night's alert was expected to be lifted Wednesday when water
temperatures cooled to below 200 degrees. Workers would then begin looking for
what caused the leak and determining how long the plant would be idle.
</P>
<P>
	   Quinn said the accident was caused by a leak in a tube carrying hot,
slightly radioactive water through a a pool of cooler water, which is thereby
turned into steam. The steam is used to turn a turbine, which generates
electricity. The plant produces about a seventh of the power Con Ed supplies to
its 3 million customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the hot water was under high pressure, it turned into steam as it
escaped from the tube at about 7:30 p.m. It was vented through the building's
roof, but a radiation detector in the vent sounded an alarm and automatically
closed the vent, so the slightly radioactive steam escaped into the air for only
a few seconds, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Radiation measurements taken around the plant found nothing above normal
background radiation, Quinn said, and workers were not exposed to anything above
what they get in a normal workday. No one was injured, he said, and "There is no
danger to the health and welfare of the general public."
</P>
<P>
	   Some villagers in Buchanan took that with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm definitely afraid," said Regina Erben, just four doors from the plant
entrance. "I'm afraid to brush my teeth. I'm afraid to make the coffee."
</P>
<P>
	   Others, however, said they have learned to live with the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   David Allen, a magazine writer from Buchanan, said, "I guess I trust that
they'll tell us if there's a problem." George Kiljarian of Ossining, a retired
attorney, said, "I'm a fatalist. I made it through World War II. ... If they've
never had a problem in 26 years I guess that's all right."
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Jacobs, executive director of the Westchester People's Action
Coalition, said the Indian Point plants are old and failing and should be
investigated independent of the NRC.
</P>
<P>
	   NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan said steel-alloy tubes like the one that leaked
"have been known to develop leaks from time to time." Con Ed's Robert Leonard
said the tubes at Indian Point 2 were the originals from 1974. In the past, when
leaks were found, a tube might simply be plugged and not used because the
generator does not need all of the 200 tubes it has, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The nearby Indian Point 3 reactor, owned by the state Power Authority, has
been tentatively purchased for $806 million by Entergy Corp. of New Orleans,
which said Monday that it was also interested in buying Indian Point 2. Entergy
spokesman Carl Crawford said Wednesday that Tuesday's leak had no effect on
either deal.

<HEADLINE> More Gun Risk in Public Housing  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Paralyzed by a cousin's accidental gunshot, 19-year-old
Namel Norris spreads a simple message to America's youth from his wheelchair:
``Guns are nothing to play with. Don't even pick them up.''
</P>
<P>
	   The aspiring music producer from New York City joined Andrew Cuomo, the
secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and others
Wednesday in rallying support for an agency campaign for stricter gun control
measures.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, President Clinton released a HUD report that showed
public-housing residents are more than twice as likely to be victimized by
handgun violence as other Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo, Norris and Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, whose husband was killed and her
son injured in a 1993 shooting on New York's Long Island Rail Road, reinforced
the message that gun violence remains out of control even while crime overall is
on the decline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have done some good work (to reduce violence) but we have a long way to
go,'' said McCarthy, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Crime is dropping in public housing, the HUD report found, but the nation's
2.6 million residents of public housing are at disproportionate risk of gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Four out of 1,000 Americans are victimized annually by gun violence,
compared with 10 out of 1,000 for public housing residents.
</P>
<P>
	   The study culled from crime data provided by the National Crime
Victimization Survey, the Census Bureau and HUD, did offer some promising news.
</P>
<P>
	   The crime rate declined in two-thirds of public housing authorities studied
between 1994 and 1997. Also, in 60 percent of the housing authorities, the crime
rate fell more quickly than in surrounding cities.
</P>
<P>
	   A National Rifle Association officials also bemoaned the level of gun
violence in public housing. But Wayne LaPierre, the group's executive vice
president, blamed the Clinton administration for failing to enforce existing gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For gun criminals and drug dealers, housing projects have become casinos.
By not picking up drug dealers with guns, the administration is sentencing those
people to a death sentence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said he and others gun-control advocates want to see manufacturers
equip the weapons with safety devices that would prevent incidents such as the
Jan. 16 incident in which a bullet smashed into Norris' collarbone.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the president has asked Congress for $280 million for more 1,000
federal, state and local prosecutors and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
agents assigned solely to enforcing current gun laws.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, federal and local officials are still threatening to bring a
national lawsuit from public housing authorities against the gun industry if
manufacturers fail to enter negotiations designed to increase firearm safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo described the talks with gun makers as productive and said they would
continue.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Limits Breast Cancer Coverage  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Patient groups and doctors are praising a decision by Aetna
Inc., the nation's largest health insurer, to stop paying for most bone marrow
transplants for breast cancer patients following the discrediting of a pivotal
study.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Aetna is doing the right thing," Fran Visco, president of the
National Breast Cancer Coalition, said Wednesday. "Bone marrow transplant is not
quality health care for women with breast cancer."
</P>
<P>
	   Such praise is rare from health care advocates, who usually criticize
insurers when they cut benefits, accusing them of scrimping to boost profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna said it will only pay for the physically grueling and expensive
therapy for women participating in federally sponsored studies. It will continue
to pay for bone marrow transplants for other illnesses such as leukemia, in
which studies have proven its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna's decision comes just two weeks after it was disclosed that a South
African study of the treatment-- which had given hope to some women with
advanced breast cancer -- contained falsified data.
</P>
<P>
	   The South African study was the only one of five long-awaited studies that
initially found the treatment helped prolong survival rates. The four other
studies released in April 1999 found no difference in survival for breast cancer
patients who underwent the bone marrow transplant therapy than those who tried
less risky treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   "At this point in time there is no credible evidence that this approach is
likely to be better than a more conventional approach," said Dr. Arthur
Leibowitz, chief medical officer for Aetna U.S. Healthcare. "We now have five
well controlled studies that show this thing doesn't work."
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna was praised for continuing coverage of the treatment for members in
medical studies, as well as deciding to stop paying for the therapy for women
not participating in studies.
</P>
<P>
	   "This appears to be a reasonable decision given the lack of evidence that
bone marrow transplant is a benefit," said Dr. Harmon Eyre, chief medical
officer of the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the South African study was found to be flawed on Feb. 4, the
findings of the four other studies prompted top cancer specialists to conclude
that, at least for women with advanced breast cancer, a bone marrow transplant
was not a good option.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Breast Cancer Coalition had also advised that women who aren't
participating in medical research testing should not try bone transplant
therapy. Studies on the therapy are continuing to find out if certain types of
breast cancer patients can benefit from the therapy.
</P>
<P>
	   In the controversial treatment, women receive ultrahigh doses of
chemotherapy followed by a bone marrow transplant. Thousands of women have
demanded the procedure, believing it is their last best hope.
</P>
<P>
	   Bone marrow transplants usually cost at least $100,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Insurers initially balked at covering the treatment in the late 1980s, but
eventually most paid for it after pressed by lawsuits and fears about a public
relations backlash.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Aetna paid for 336 bone marrow transplants, about half of them
for breast cancer patients, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
	   United Healthcare, the nation's second largest health insurer, said
Wednesday that it will continue to leave the decision on bone marrow transplant
coverage to its doctors. United allows its patients to get the therapy at
certain hospitals, if doctors at those institutions believe it is proper.
</P>
<P>
	   "We still think this is a patient-physician decision," said Dr. Lee
Newcomer, United's senior vice president for health policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the studies came out last spring, United has seen a big decline in
patients seeking the treatment, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most women are now seeing that the risk of the treatment is not the worth
it," Newcomer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cigna HealthCare, a unit of Cigna Corp., said in a statement late Wednesday
it would continue to consider the bone marrow transplant coverage on a
case-by-case basis.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Feels Sorry for the GOP  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A smiling President Clinton said Wednesday he is trying
to ``cast a little sunshine'' over the 2000 presidential race by not speaking
ill of the Republicans trying to take his job. That didn't stop him from staying
he feels rather sorry for the GOP these days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have a lot of sympathy with Governor Bush and Senator McCain,'' Clinton
said during his first formal news conference of the year. ``I mean, it's hard
for them to figure out what to run on.''
</P>
<P>
	   Noting the nation's booming economy, lower welfare and crime rates and other
optimistic signs, Clinton said his administration has left Republicans little to
quibble about.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So they've got a tough job,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Clinton said he did not want to complicate the presidential race by
commenting extensively, he spoke at length on politics during an hourlong
exchange with reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The president brushed aside comments that Bush, the Texas governor, and
McCain, a senator from Arizona, made during a snappish debate Tuesday night.
Both men said they resented being likened to Clinton, with Bush asserting:
``That's about as low as you can get in the Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're playing to an electorate, most of whom did not vote for me,''
Clinton said simply.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, when a reporter said all four major presidential candidates are
``running against your behavior and conduct,'' Clinton interjected: ``Well, if I
were running, I'd do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alluding to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal, Clinton said he does not worry
that Democrats will be tarred by association with him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are really smart ... and it's pretty hard to convince them that
they should hold anyone responsible for someone else's mistake, particularly a
personal mistake,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who wants to see Vice President Al Gore succeed him, nonetheless
had kind words for all the major candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to think I'm casting a little sunshine,'' over the race, Clinton
said to laughter. ``I keep trying to build these fellas up, you know. I'm being
nice and generous and all that.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also said American voters have a good choice this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You've basically got four people running for president now who are people
of accomplishment, people who have certain convictions, people who have, I
think, pretty clear philosophies and records,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he is offering some advice to his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
is running for Senate in New York, and said he is proud of her performance so
far.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My instinct is that she will do right well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton stumbled around a bit but ultimately ducked a question asking him to
compare campaign tactics of his wife and Gore on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think anything I say to get in the middle of that is not,'' Clinton
broke off. ``I'm not running for office, and I don't,'' he broke off again. ``By
and large, I think I shouldn't comment.'' A moment later he added: ``You know,
there may be a few exceptions.''

<HEADLINE> LA Police Chief Decries 4 Officers  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT JABLON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At least four of 12 officers involved in a police
corruption investigation never should have been hired because they had been
arrested or had outstanding debts, Chief Bernard C. Parks said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, the four were disqualified but they were later hired, in some
cases after an appeal, the chief said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were misdemeanor arrests, alcohol ... domestic violence, things like
that,'' or debts that showed an inability to handle their finances, Parks said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those are the kinds of things that are red flags for us as it relates to
how an officer will perform in the future,'' said the chief, who was ordered to
make a public presentation by the City Council on how he is handling the growing
corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Officer Rafael Perez, hoping for leniency when he is sentenced for
stealing cocaine from an evidence locker, claims officers in the Rampart
Division near downtown framed and brutalized people and even shot unarmed
suspects. Lawsuits involving such claims could cost the city $125 million,
according to one official estimate.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 30 convictions also have been overturned as a result of the
corruption probe. Parks said 99 defendants in 57 cases involving Perez may have
been framed through perjury or false arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Parks said he did not know whether Perez was one of the four officers whose
background checks turned up problems that should have kept them off the force.
Parks did say that one of the four was fired in 1998 for allegedly beating a
handcuffed suspect inside the Rampart station.
</P>
<P>
	   A report to be submitted to the civilian Police Commission by March 1 will
call for giving lie detector tests to all police officer candidates, beefing up
the Internal Affairs division and setting up ``sting'' operations to trap bad
cops.
</P>
<P>
	   Parks also told council members that ``telltale signs'' of poor performance
in the Rampart Division were missed by overworked supervisors, and the problem
exists across the department.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 11 officers have been relieved of duty since the corruption scandal
broke last fall. Parks declined to provide a new count.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Attacks Lucky Strike Giveaway  </HEADLINE>
    By CATHERINE WILSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- The maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes handed out thousands of
red roses on Valentine's Day to pedestrians near the courthouse where a jury is
hearing the damage claims of three smokers with cancer, smokers' attorneys said
Wednesday in a court filing.
</P>
<P>
	   The long-stemmed roses bearing the message "Lucky Loves You, Compliments of
Lucky Strike" were cited in a court filing as the latest example of the tobacco
industry's violation of gag order covering both sides of the landmark trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury already has ruled against the industry and will be asked within
weeks to decide compensatory damages for the three smokers and then punitive
damages for an estimated 500,000 sick Florida smokers.
</P>
<P>
	   The rose giveaway, accompanied by information about the Brown &AMP; Williamson
product and its Web site, was "intended to curry favor with the jury, influence
public opinion in their favor and violate the gag order," attorney Stanley
Rosenblatt charged.
</P>
<P>
	   He asked Circuit Judge Robert Kaye to keep Brown &AMP; Williamson from doing
anything like that again and highlighted the rose incident in a brief asking a
state appeals court to keep the gag order in place.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry has asked the appeals court to wipe out the gag order before
the jury decides punitive damages. Arguments are set for next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry fears a record-setting $300 billion verdict and plummeting
stock values if it doesn't have a chance to give its perspective on the jury
award.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown &AMP; Williamson representatives did not immediately return messages
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The other defendants are: R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, Lorillard, Liggett
Group Inc., the Council for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Bush Breaks Spending Records  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has now spent more than $50 million on his
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, a record for any political
race, while John McCain has drastically narrowed the gap between the two
candidates' money for upcoming primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had $20 million in the bank as of Jan. 31 and had been spending at a
rate of $3 million a week even before ratcheting up following his loss to McCain
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, reported having $10 million in the bank as of
mid-February, and has been raising $150,000 to $200,000 a day via the Internet
in addition to his big-ticket fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
	   At the start of the year, Bush had $31.4 million in the bank, while McCain
had $1.5 million plus $4.2 million in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a world of difference from what it was a month ago,'' said Larry
Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a research
group that studies money and campaigns. ``McCain really is within financial
striking distance here if he can keep this momentum going.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is trying to replenish his funds, having already raised a campaign
record of more than $70 million. He is planning four or five fund-raising events
in March, campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   He needs the money because he has also set records for spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spent $13 million in January, bringing his total to $50 million for the
campaign, well over the $42.2 million Bob Dole spent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, spent $12 million over the past six weeks -- almost as
much as the $14 million he spent during all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is when you're supposed to spend your money,'' McCain spokesman
Howard Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because he is accepting federal funds for his campaign, McCain has a limit
on how much he can spend. The limit is around $40 million, plus additional funds
for some legal and accounting costs. McCain so far has spent around $26 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is not accepting federal funds for his campaign and can keep raising
and spending as much as he wants.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in South Carolina, where he is competing against McCain in
Saturday's GOP primary, Bush said he was not concerned about his campaign
spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got a plan in place that's going to enable me to stay in this race
for the long run,'' Bush said. ``We have been fighting in every primary state,
we're on plan and I think I've got a good chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
	   Former Rep. Bill Paxon, a Bush adviser, noted that the campaign was spending
money not only to win the nomination but the general election as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of Bush's money is going for television. Fleischer said Bush was on the
air in seven states: South Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Washington, North
Dakota, Virginia and California. Opinsky said McCain is on the air in five
states: South Carolina, Michigan, Virginia, Washington and California.
</P>
<P>
	   A computer analysis of Bush's campaign spending through Dec. 31 showed that
he had spent $6.3 million on television -- more than any other presidential
candidate. McCain had spent $2.6 million. Dole spent $7 million for his entire
1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An army moves on its belly as they say, and when you make a conscious
decision that they have made to build an organization, it costs money,'' said
Ron Kaufman, who was White House political director under President Bush and now
is supporting his son. ``In the end it is all about organization and TV. I
believe very strongly that no state is going to be lost by George W. Bush
because of a lack of money.''

<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- AFL-CIO leaders, in a shift in stance toward immigrants,
are calling for the repeal of a 1986 law they say has made it hard to unionize
or improve conditions for undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the labor federation's governing committee agreed to the new
policy unanimously Wednesday. The stand also commits unions to press for amnesty
for the estimated five to six million workers and their families who are here
illegally or have only temporary legal status.
</P>
<P>
	   "With this resolution, the AFL-CIO proudly stands on the side of immigrant
workers," said AFL-CIO executive vice president Linda Chavez-Thompson.
</P>
<P>
	   "The current system of immigration enforcement in the United States is
broken and we must fix it. We believe the AFL-CIO can lead on this issue," said.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor leaders said the new stance recognizes new labor market realities.
Unions are now actively recruiting immigrants who in the past had been kept at
arm's length because they were seen as a threat to Americans' jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Employers are saying they're desperate for workers and there are workers in
this country who have no way to get legal status despite the fact that they're
going to work every day," said Andrew Stern, president of the Service Employees
International Union.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO is still committed to opposing increases in the number of
immigrants allowed to come here to work legally.
</P>
<P>
	   But the labor federation is calling for new immigration laws that would
protect those already here working illegally from firing or deportation if they
try to unionize or complain to the government about violations of labor laws,
including the minimum wage and safety requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO wants the new rules to replace a law passed in 1986 that set up
the current system of enforcing immigration laws through employers, holding over
companies the threat of punishment if they hire undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Unions originally supported that law believing it would serve their interest
in keeping American jobs for American citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, that stance has backfired.
</P>
<P>
	   With the unemployment rate the lowest in 30 years and employers scrambling
to find help, a wave of undocumented workers are filling jobs that Americans
don't want -- working as janitors and meat cutters, in hotels and restaurants,
on farms and in clothing factories.
</P>
<P>
	   Unions have begun to recognize these immigrant workers, who are easily
exploited by companies because of their illegal status, as good prospects to
boost the long-stagnating ranks of organized labor.
</P>
<P>
	   But organizing has been difficult because, labor leaders say, companies --
even those that have been complicit in hiring undocumented workers in the first
place -- react by using the worker's illegal status for intimidation or grounds
for firing.
</P>
<P>
	   In Minnesota, nine Holiday Inn workers who were trying to organize under the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union recently won
$72,000 in back pay through a federal complaint process after they lost their
jobs when the company turned them in to immigration officials. The nine,
however, still face deportation to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, who traveled here to meet with the AFL-CIO
leaders today, said she did not make any commitments but told them that the
Clinton administration would consider their proposals, including the amnesty
request.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think its important to do whatever we can to strengthen our own laws and
not to exploit workers in any way in this country," Herman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has already take some recent steps to protect immigrant
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   In a switch from past policy, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
announced last fall that it would begin defending undocumented workers who have
been discriminated against.

<HEADLINE> 1907 Campaign Finance Law Attacked  </HEADLINE>
   By BILL BERGSTROM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Political parties and contributors have so effectively
sidestepped a 1907 ban on corporate contributions to federal candidates that the
courts should strike down the law, a lawyer for a man indicted for illegal
donations said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mushrooming ``soft money'' donations to the parties by corporations and
unions -- along with ``issue ads'' that can make veiled attacks on candidates
without directly advocating their defeat -- have rendered the law useless,
attorney Floyd Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
	   Abrams represented Renato P. Mariani, former president of Empire Sanitary
Landfill of Taylor, who was indicted in the same wide-ranging campaign finance
probe that led to a prison sentence for state Rep. Frank Serafini.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This statute does not work,'' Abrams told the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   The chief judge of the appeals court, Edward R. Becker, said such arguments
were understandable when ``you have soft money that is off the charts'' and
``issue ads in which the difference may be gossamer between addressing an issue
and supporting a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   But attorney David Kolker of the Federal Elections Commission said it is up
to Congress, not the courts, to change the law if they think it needs
improvement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His request to throw the baby out with the bath water should be
rejected,'' Kolker said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariani and other former Empire officials were charged with funneling
corporate money from the landfill to candidates for federal office, including
President Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
	   Serafini, charged in the same indictment with lying to a grand jury when he
denied being reimbursed by Empire for contributing to the Dole campaign, was
sentenced in November to five months in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's arguments came in a civil lawsuit filed by Mariani. U.S.
District Judge Thomas Vanaskie, chief judge of the middle district of
Pennsylvania, sought the appeals court ruling, saying in a 144-page memorandum
in October that he found many of Mariani's arguments to be true.
</P>
<P>
	   Soft-money contributions and loopholes have ``essentially rendered the
contributions and spending limits meaningless,'' Vanaskie wrote, questioning
whether the 1907 ban still meets the legal standard that it serve a
``significant state interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   The term ``soft money'' refers to contributions made to political parties to
be used for business-related expenses, not for a particular candidate's
campaign. But critics say the parties have used the money for millions of
dollars worth of so-called ``issue ads'' that actually tout candidates or
criticize their opponents.

<HEADLINE> Israel Establishes Lebanon Panel  </HEADLINE>
   By JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's security Cabinet handed three ministers the power
on Wednesday to order rapid military responses to attacks on Israeli troops in
Lebanon -- a sign that Israel plans to intensify counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The flexibility of a smaller committee would mean that attacks on power
stations, bridges and other infrastructure targets in Lebanon could come within
minutes of the death of a soldier, instead of hours or even days.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-minister committee, whose existence was confirmed by other Cabinet
ministers in interviews broadcast after the security Cabinet met Wednesday,
includes Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Foreign Minister David Levy and Transport
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
	   Some members of Barak's security Cabinet -- until now, the body that decided
how to respond to attacks -- voted against forming the committee, saying they
wondered if concentrating such power was wise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot get into a situation in which military actions are authorized
automatically,'' Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami told Israel television.
</P>
<P>
	   The formation of the new team was a clear sign to Syria, the main power in
Lebanon, that Israel would stand firm against the recent escalation of attacks
on its troops in an Israeli-occupied buffer zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Attacks on Israeli soldiers rose after peace talks with Syria broke down.
Barak, who has pledged to pull Israel's troops out of Lebanon by July, has been
trying to attract the Syrians back to the talks, but has shown reluctance to
appear as if he is retreating under fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The attacks are the work of Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militant Islamist
group that Israel says would not be able to function without Syria's go-ahead
and encouragement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hezbollah attacks have killed seven Israeli troops in recent weeks.
Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah pledged Wednesday there would be more
Israeli deaths, and threatened to fire rockets into Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month Israeli warplanes destroyed three electricity
transformers, a Hezbollah headquarters and other targets, in response to the
killing of three Israeli soldiers in a Hezbollah attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army chief-of-staff said troops were now ordered to immediately
return fire when attacked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are the instructions that the soldiers have received -- that if they
identify the source of the fire, they have to return fire,'' Lt. Gen. Shaul
Mofaz told Israel radio. Previously, troops had to wait for orders to return
fire.
</P>
<P>
	   In Damascus, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa sent a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan rebutting an earlier letter from Israel and
defending the attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas, the official Syrian Arab News
Agency said Wednesday. It did not say when the letter was sent.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, a letter by Israel's Levy was circulated at the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Israeli minister's letter described the Lebanese resistance as
terrorism, but it ignored the fact that resisting foreign occupation is a
legitimate right guaranteed by international charters and practiced by nations
through history,'' the Syrian agency quoted al-Sharaa as writing to Annan.
</P>
<P>
	   Levy had also blamed the Lebanese and the Syrian governments for failing to
curb the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Blaming others constitutes an irrational and illogical disregard of
(Israel's) responsibility for its flagrant aggression (on Lebanon),'' al-Sharaa
wrote.

<HEADLINE> No Court-Martial in Anthrax Case  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER THORNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DOVER, Del. (AP) -- The Air Force says it won't court-martial a major who
questioned the safety of the military's anthrax vaccine and refused the
mandatory injections.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Sonnie Bates, a 14-year, decorated pilot, was believed to have been the
highest-ranking Air Force officer on track to face a court-martial for refusing
the anthrax vaccine.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Bates has agreed to an administrative hearing by his commander at
Dover Air Force Base that could result in sanctions ranging from a loss of pay
to 30 days arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement, there will be no conviction on his record, and the base
commander could decide not to punish him.
</P>
<P>
	   Bates has been on administrative duty and grounded from flying since he
refused his vaccination Dec. 3. He initially was charged with disobeying an
order, punishable by up to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Frank Smolinsky, chief of public affairs, said the military had been
proceeding toward a court-martial.
</P>
<P>
	   The news Wednesday that the possibility of a court-martial had been removed
came one day before the House Government Reform Committee was expected to
release a report critical of the vaccine program.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Defense wants to vaccinate all 2.4 million of its active
and reserve uniformed personnel by 2003 against anthrax, a deadly biological
weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   According to department, 383,000 military personnel have begun the six-shot
series. About 200 to 300 service personnel have refused the vaccine since the
program began in August 1998, according to the Pentagon, and several have been
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
	   Bates' said his concerns grew after he saw members of his squadron become
sick soon after starting the vaccination series.
</P>
<P>
	   The Air Force maintains the vaccine is safe, though manufacture of it was
temporarily halted in December after the Food and Drug Administration found
numerous violations in an inspection of the Michigan plant that makes it.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite halting production, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered the
vaccinations to continue, saying it would be irresponsible to send soldiers into
combat without protection. He said the military has enough vaccine to last about
a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Bates earlier refused the option of an administrative hearing when it was
offered. He accepted it this time because the Air Force agreed to forgo a
court-martial, said Capt. William Burke, an Air Force lawyer defending Bates.
</P>
<P>
	   Military law still allows the Air Force to pursue further discipline if
Bates is ordered to take the vaccine and refuses again.
</P>
<P>
	   Sgt. Paul Fazzini, a spokesman for Dover Air Force Base, said in all
likelihood, Bates will face another order to take the anthrax vaccine.
</P>
<P>
	   Roxane Bates, the major's wife, said they still don't know if her husband
will have to leave the Air Force if he wants to remain a pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All he's wanted is to get back into his military airplane and go back to
work,'' she said.

	   Today is Thursday, Feb. 17, the 48th day of 2000. There are 318 days left in
the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's Highlight in History:
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 17, 1801, the House of Representatives broke an electoral tie
between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, electing Jefferson president. Burr
became vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   On this date:
</P>
<P>
	   In 1817, a street in Baltimore became the first to be lighted with gas from
America's first gas company.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1865, Columbia, S.C., burned as the Confederates evacuated and Union
forces moved in. (It's not known which side set the blaze.)
</P>
<P>
	   In 1897, the forerunner of the National PTA, the National Congress of
Mothers, was founded in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1904, Giacomo Puccini's opera ``Madama Butterfly'' was poorly received at
its world premiere at La Scala.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1933, Newsweek was first published.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1947, the Voice of America began broadcasting to the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1964, the Supreme Court ruled that congressional districts within each
state had to be roughly equal in population.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1972, President Nixon departed on his historic trip to China.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1988, Lt. Col. William Higgins, an American officer serving with a United
Nations truce monitoring group, was kidnapped in southern Lebanon (and later
slain).
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer was sentenced in Milwaukee to life in
prison. (He was beaten to death in prison in November 1994.)
</P>
<P>
	   Ten years ago: Former President Reagan spent a second day in a Los Angeles
courtroom, giving videotaped testimony about the Iran-Contra affair for the
trial of his former national security adviser, John Poindexter.
</P>
<P>
	   Five years ago: Colin Ferguson was convicted of six counts of murder in the
December 1993 Long Island Rail Road shootings. (He was later sentenced to a
minimum of 200 years in prison).
</P>
<P>
	   One year ago: In a satellite-linked address to college campuses across the
country, President Clinton made his case for shoring up Social Security and
Medicare. Israeli security guards shot and killed three Kurds who had forced
their way into the Israeli consulate in Berlin; the protesters were enraged by
reports that Israel aided in the arrest of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.

<HEADLINE> Faith Groups OK'd in Federal Program  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A literacy program for poor families would allow
participating religious groups to make hiring decisions based on their beliefs
under legislation approved Wednesday by a House panel.
</P>
<P>
	   Changes made in the $500 million Even Start program would guarantee that
religious groups could help offer tutoring to preschoolers and literacy and job
training for their parents. The groups also wouldn't have to cover up sacred
images at program sites or hire staff that didn't adhere to their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill approved by the House Education and the Workforce Committee is the
latest in a line of recent ``charitable choice'' measures that permit religious
groups to participate in federally-funded social service programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Trying to totally separate the faith of a society from any form of
influence is ridiculous,'' said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., who sponsored the
changes approved by the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   He said religious groups often have the community ties to deliver social
programs such as day care, drug treatment, welfare-to-work and, in this case,
family literacy.
</P>
<P>
	   But critics say such proposals reverse 250 years of separation of church and
state and are tantamount to giving certain faiths governmental approval and
making religious belief public policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The courts have never allowed churches to get tax dollars to run
educational programs,'' said Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans
United for Separation of Church and State. ``It is particularly appalling that a
congressional committee thinks it is okay to fund programs that practice
religious discrimination in hiring.''
</P>
<P>
	   Charitable choice backers won their first major victory during the 1996
overhaul of federal welfare laws. Religious groups were allowed to deliver
services to the poor. Other programs have followed. The juvenile justice bill
that is tied up in a congressional dispute over gun control allows faith-based
organizations to participate in programs for troubled teens.
</P>
<P>
	   Souder says the changes in the literacy bill would make groups more
comfortable in providing the services without fear of being sued or threatened
by the main program provider. For example, a Catholic church, could leave a
crucifix up on a wall during tutoring or a synagogue would not have to hire
non-Jewish staff to get funding, Souder said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some opponents worry that giving groups more leeway to practice their faiths
can have undue religious influence, particularly over children.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., an education committee member who opposed the
measure, said, ``The practice of federally sanctioned religious discrimination
is wrong for children, it's wrong for adults. It's so wrong, I don't think you
need to differentiate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The literacy programs is one of two renewed Wednesday under the $15 billion
federal law that governs programs for children from kindergarten though 12th
grade. A funding program for school districts that lose property tax revenue to
federal lands such as military bases was also sent to the full House for
approval. Last year, the House voted to renew projects for teachers, schools
serving poor children, and non-English speaking pupils.

<HEADLINE> Residents Angry After Nuke Release  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM FITZGERALD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) -- A generator leak at a Hudson River nuclear power
plant resulted in a brief release of radioactive steam, and some people living
in the plant's shadow said Wednesday that they should have been alerted to the
accident.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Where were the sirens?'' asked David Coviello, 55, who lives two doors
from the plant gate. ``I have a 7-year-old son, an 18-year-old daughter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the steam was barely radioactive, and its escape Tuesday
night from the Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor was ``momentary and minuscule,''
so there was no health danger and no need to warn nearby residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, resident Salvatore Simone said officials should notify people of any
accident, regardless of its seriousness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I should decide for myself,'' he said. ``I might have gotten into the car
with my family and gotten away.''
</P>
<P>
	   The sirens were kept silent because officials in four counties agreed that
there was no reason to set them off, said deputy county executive, Jay Hashmall.
</P>
<P>
	   Guidelines from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ``call for the sounding of
sirens only when some protective action is needed,'' such as evacuations or
stay-inside orders, Hashmall said.
</P>
<P>
	   Consolidated Edison Co., which owns and operates the plant, declared an
alert, a first for the plant, which is on the Hudson River about 35 miles north
of New York City. About 15.5 million people live within a 50-mile radius. An
alert is one of four categories of nuclear events identified by the NRC. In
order from least serious to most serious they are: unusual event, alert, site
area emergency and general emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   The only general emergency at a U.S. nuclear plant was the March 1979
accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Mindy Landau of the NRC said there are an average of three or four alerts a
year among the nation's 103 operating reactors.
</P>
<P>
	   Con Ed Vice President Steve Quinn said the accident -- the most serious in
the 26-year history of the plant -- was caused by a leak in a tube carrying hot,
slightly radioactive water through a pool of cooler water, which is thereby
turned into steam. The steam is used to turn a turbine, which generates
electricity. The plant produces about a seventh of the power Con Ed supplies to
its 3 million customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the hot water was under high pressure, it turned into steam as it
escaped from the tube. It was vented through the building's roof, but a
radiation detector in the vent sounded an alarm and automatically closed the
vent, so the slightly radioactive steam escaped into the air for only a few
seconds, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Radiation measurements taken around the plant found nothing above normal
background radiation, Quinn said, adding: ``There is no danger to the health and
welfare of the general public.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some villagers in Buchanan took that with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm definitely afraid,'' said Regina Erben, just four doors from the plant
entrance. ``I'm afraid to brush my teeth. I'm afraid to make the coffee.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others, however, said they have learned to live with the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I guess I trust that they'll tell us if there's a problem,'' said David
Allen, a magazine writer.
</P>
<P>
	   Said George Kiljarian, a retired attorney: ``I'm a fatalist. I made it
through World War II. ... If they've never had a problem in 26 years I guess
that's all right.''

<HEADLINE> Two Arraigned in Students' Deaths  </HEADLINE>
   By DERRILL HOLLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two men pleaded innocent Wednesday in the shooting deaths
of two popular high school students hours after President Clinton cited the
killings in his push to convince Congress to approve gun safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Guns in the wrong hands continue to claim too many young lives, like those
of Andre Wallace and Natasha Marsh,'' Clinton said at a White House news
conference, adding he hoped Congress would approve ``common-sense gun safety
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Marsh and Wallace, both 17, were shot to death Feb. 8 outside her home just
hours after Wallace was involved in a fight following a basketball game at
Woodrow Wilson High School.
</P>
<P>
	   Jermaine Johnson, an Amtrak train mechanic, turned himself in to District of
Columbia Police early Wednesday. Johnson is the only person insured to drive the
black 1997 Ford Expedition that police said was involved in the drive-by
shooting. A second man, Carlton Blount surrendered to police Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Innocents pleas were entered on their behalf during an arraignment Wednesday
on charges of first-degree murder while armed. They were ordered held without

<P>
	   Federal prosecutors contend that Blount used Johnson's cellular phone to
determine what type of car the couple was driving and where they might be found.
They also said witnesses have placed Johnson at the game and in the vehicle the
night of the killings.

	   Police say they have received a videotape of the altercation between Blount
and Wallace. ``It puts Mr. Blount right there,'' said William P. McManus, the
assistant police chief.

to Blount.

	   Wallace was captain of his high school football team, and Marsh was an
honors student enrolled in a business and finance academy program at the school.

<P>
	   Their deaths are among 49 murders in the city this year. That represents a
35 percent increase from a year ago.

<HEADLINE> U.Va. Sees Drop in Black Applicants  </HEADLINE>
   By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- The number of black applicants to the
University of Virginia is down 25 percent this year, and some officials blame a
heated debate over the school's affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of black applicants for the freshman class entering next fall
dropped to 961, from 1,287 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's devastating,'' Rick Turner, dean of the university's Office of
African-American Affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner said it is the largest single-year drop in black applicants since he
came to the university in 1988, and possibly the biggest since the school began
admitting blacks in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any time you have a drop in enrollment there's no one reason, but it
doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that one of the primary reasons is
because of the controversy we've been embroiled in over affirmative action,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, a special committee of the school's governing body sparked
debates and protests when it considered changing the way the university factors
race into admissions.
</P>
<P>
	   The university decided to drop a scoring system that gave an advantage to
some applicants for race and other factors, such as geographic location. But the
university still informally considers race among the many factors in determining
which students are admitted.
</P>
<P>
	   University spokeswoman Louise M. Dudley said while it is hard to pinpoint
one reason for the fewer black applicants, it is clear the affirmative action
debate played a role.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall undergraduate applications to the University of Virginia also
decreased by 16 percent this year. A total of 14,298 incoming freshmen applied,
compared with 17,090 last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Dudley said possible factors contributing to the overall drop include the
university's decline in the national rankings of top public universities, and
higher tuition for out-of-state students.

<HEADLINE> Sears Pulls Benetton Contract  </HEADLINE>
    By TAMMY WEBBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. terminated its contract with the trendy
Benetton clothing company Wednesday under pressure from victims' rights groups
who objected to the Italian company's ad campaign featuring death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   Sears chairman and chief executive Arthur C. Martinez was "outraged," as
were many customers, at ads showing photographs of the inmates, said company
spokesman Tom Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
	   The company ended its contract even after Benetton agreed to allow Sears to
preview future ads. Sears had previously said it would keep the contract under
that condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Sears has been weighing its decision to terminate the contract since it
learned the content of the ads in early January, "and it ultimately came to the
point we felt this decision had to be made," Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been hearing from people who have lost loved ones to some of the
folks who have been profiled," Nicholson said. "It's reopened wounds and brought
back a lot of painful memories and people are hurt by it. They feel the (inmates
are) glorified and the victims are ignored."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday groups picketed a Houston Sears store and Benetton's New York
office. Hours later, Sears announced it would immediately pull Benetton-designed
clothing from all 400 Sears stores that have been selling the Benetton USA line.
</P>
<P>
	   "The advertising campaign was inconsistent with what Sears has come to stand
for and is inconsistent with the customer base we serve," said Nicholson. "We
have a high level of customer trust and loyalty, and there has been some strong
emotional reaction to (Benetton's) campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   The ads, which began appearing in magazines and on billboards late last
month, feature portraits of American death row inmates in prison uniforms over
the words, "Sentenced to Death." The ads also give the inmate's name, date of
birth, crime and expected method of execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Benetton officials said the ads were meant to raise awareness about the
death penalty, but victims' rights groups said the ads glorified convicted
killers and were insensitive to victims' families and friends.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody has the right to their opinion, but the ad campaign is not a
social debate," said Dianne Clements, president of Justice for All, a
Houston-based victims' rights group. "If it were, there would be balance.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not about the death penalty, it's about Benetton products. Benetton
wants to spoon-feed the American consuming public their interpretation of social
awareness, (but) we will regurgitate it."
</P>
<P>
	   She said she has "an absolute, utmost respect for Sears and their decision."
</P>
<P>
	   Clements said Benetton was not a good association for Sears, which she said
is an "All-American store."
</P>
<P>
	   Benetton spokesman Mark Major did not immediately return a phone call
seeking comment on Sears' decision. But earlier Wednesday he said Benetton stood
by its ads and believed it had succeeded in "launching a national and global
discussion on capital punishment."
</P>
<P>
	   "This had nothing to do with apparel; nothing to do with the product," Major
said. "Benetton has historically approached social issues and we think it is
important ... to engage people to think about issues."
</P>
<P>
	   Benetton has made headlines in the past with ads addressing such topics as
AIDS and racism. It also prompted protests from the Roman Catholic Church in the
1990s for ads featuring models dressed as a priest and a nun that were kissing.
</P>
<P>
	   Sears, based in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, introduced the
clothing line, called Benetton USA, last fall to help boost lagging clothing
sales. Benetton made that line exclusively for Sears and continued to sell its
United Colors of Benetton clothing in its own stores.

<HEADLINE> Bush Breaks Spending Records  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has now spent more than $50 million on his
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, a record for any political
race, while John McCain has drastically narrowed the gap between the two
candidates' money for upcoming primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had $20 million in the bank as of Jan. 31 and had been spending at a
rate of $3 million a week even before ratcheting up following his loss to McCain
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, reported having $10 million in the bank as of
mid-February, including money borrowed against the federal funds he will receive
later. He has been raising $150,000 to $200,000 a day via the Internet in
addition to his big-ticket fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
	   At the start of the year, Bush had $31.4 million in the bank, while McCain
had $1.5 million plus $4.2 million in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a world of difference from what it was a month ago,'' said Larry
Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a research
group that studies money and campaigns. ``McCain really is within financial
striking distance here if he can keep this momentum going.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is trying to replenish his funds, having already raised a campaign
record of more than $70 million, cloaking himself with an aura of invincibility.
He is planning four or five fund-raising events in March, campaign spokesman Ari
Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   He needs the money because he has also set records for spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spent $13 million in January, bringing his total to $50 million for the
campaign, well over the $42.2 million Bob Dole spent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, spent $12 million over the past six weeks -- almost as
much as the $14 million he spent during all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is when you're supposed to spend your money,'' McCain spokesman
Howard Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because he is accepting federal funds for his campaign, McCain has a limit
on how much he can spend. The limit is around $40 million, plus additional funds
for some legal and accounting costs. McCain so far has spent around $26 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is not accepting federal funds for his campaign and can keep raising
and spending as much as he wants.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in South Carolina, where he is competing against McCain in
Saturday's GOP primary, Bush said he was not concerned about his campaign
spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got a plan in place that's going to enable me to stay in this race
for the long run,'' Bush said. ``We have been fighting in every primary state,
we're on plan and I think I've got a good chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
	   Former Rep. Bill Paxon, a Bush adviser, noted that the campaign was spending
money not only to win the nomination but the general election as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of Bush's money is going for television. Fleischer said Bush was on the
air in seven states: South Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Washington, North
Dakota, Virginia and California. Opinsky said McCain is on the air in five
states: South Carolina, Michigan, Virginia, Washington and California.
</P>
<P>
	   A computer analysis of Bush's campaign spending through Dec. 31 showed that
he had spent $6.3 million on television -- more than any other presidential
candidate. McCain had spent $2.6 million. Dole spent $7 million for his entire
1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An army moves on its belly as they say, and when you make a conscious
decision that they have made to build an organization, it costs money,'' said
Ron Kaufman, who was White House political director under President Bush and now
is supporting his son. ``In the end it is all about organization and TV. I
believe very strongly that no state is going to be lost by George W. Bush
because of a lack of money.''

<HEADLINE> North Korean Stamp Barred From Show  </HEADLINE>
   By AMALIE YOUNG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- An international stamp dealer who planned to sell
rare postage stamps for the North Korean government at a collectors' show has
been told by the U.S. government he can't conduct business for the Communist
nation in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Trading with the Enemy Act, selling the North Korean stamp in the
United States is illegal, according to the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The stamp dealer, Mark Dianda of Oakland, Calif., said the American
Philatelic Society gave him permission to sell the new stamps at its three-day
show this coming weekend in Portland.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, North Korea appointed Dianda its agent to sell stamps in the
United States. Since then, he has been actively selling them on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   Dianda said that under his agreement, the North Korean government gets some
of the proceeds and he gets the rest. He didn't not provide the breakdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Dianda said he has sold North Korean stamps in the United States before, and
he doesn't understand why the Treasury Department is making such a fuss this
time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not like I'm trading nuclear secrets,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Korean stamps go for only 75 cents to $2 each, so North Korea
would not be getting a lot of money, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dianda also said he sees himself as a goodwill ambassador.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only way that a communist country is going to evolve into a capitalist
one is if they aren't secluded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dianda says he will display the stamps at the Portland show, but he won't
try to sell them.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Korean stamps depict sports events like basketball, cycling and
javelin in preparation for the Sydney Olympics; animals such as ducks, cats and
butterflies; and a copy of a 10th century Korean mural to commemorate the Year
of the Dragon.
</P>
<P>
	   Dianda said he thought he could sell the North Korean stamps because he had
seen press releases and newspaper articles that indicated trade sanctions
against the country had been relaxed.
</P>
<P>
	   Although President Clinton eased some sanctions against the Asian nation in
September, it is still a closed nation, and commercial sales of its stamps are
forbidden in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's kind of a disappointment; I like that sort of stuff myself as a
collector,'' said Bob Lamb, executive director of the philatelic society, which
is organizing the stamp show. ``I'd like to get some, but I'm not going to break
the law.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rejects Ending Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton rejected calls for a national
moratorium on capital punishment Wednesday but urged the nation's governors to
``look very closely'' at their death penalty systems to make sure that innocent
people are not executed.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it was courageous of Illinois Gov. George Ryan to impose a freeze on
executions after the exoneration of 13 death row inmates in his state over two
decades. Clinton said death penalty supporters -- including himself -- have ``an
especially heavy obligation'' to make sure there is no question of guilt for
condemned prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   At an hourlong news conference ranging from domestic subjects to foreign
policy, Clinton refused to say whether he will challenge ethics complaints
seeking to strip him of his Arkansas law license because of his conduct in the
Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he paid $850,000 last year to settle a related case -- the sexual
harassment suit of Paula Jones -- only to prevent it from being a distraction to
his presidency. He said the suit ``had absolutely no merit.'' The federal judge
in the Jones case found Clinton in contempt of court for giving false testimony
regarding his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   On another subject, Clinton said he has not ruled out a visit to Pakistan
next month when he visits its arch rival, India. He said his decision would
hinge on whether stopping in Islamabad could stop the regional arms race,
promote democracy in military-ruled Pakistan and resolve the India-Pakistan
conflict. He said the United States would be happy to help mediate the dispute
over Kashmir, but only if both countries seek help.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon striding into the East Room for his first regular news conference of
the year, Clinton announced the release of $125 million in federal money to help
needy families buy home heating oil in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also said he would seek $600 million in emergency funds to
deal with the current crisis and problems likely to occur later this year in
areas suffering from extreme heat. Clinton said he is restricted by law from
tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to moderate fuel prices, but added,
``I have not ruled out any action.''
</P>
<P>
	   The idea of a death penalty moratorium has gathered momentum since Gov. Ryan
took the unprecedented step Jan. 31 of putting all executions on hold in
Illinois, saying that the state's system was ``fraught with error.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before that, the American Bar Association had called for a death penalty
moratorium. Last week, Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., urged Clinton to suspend
federal executions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the federal cases, I don't believe it is called for,'' the president
said. He said 27 people have been condemned under federal law, 20 in civilian
courts and seven through the military system.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Justice Department is reviewing whether the death penalty is
being imposed fairly from a racial standpoint, and is drawing up guidelines to
make it easier for prisoners to pursue clemency requests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that if I were a governor still, I would look very closely at the
situation in my state and decide what the facts are,'' said Clinton. As
governor, he signed four execution authorizations.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also said he was inclined to support a measure by Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., on capital punishment. It provides for DNA testing of inmates who
seek to prove they did not commit the crime for which they were condemned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Would I sleep better at night if it were law?'' Clinton said. ``If it
would really work, I would. In other words, I am favorably disposed toward it.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said that Ryan ``did the right thing'' in ordering a state moratorium on
executions, particularly since ``a majority of the American people support
capital punishment, as do I.''
</P>
<P>
	   On other subjects, Clinton:
</P>
<P>
	   --Said Republican presidential hopefuls John McCain and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas have ``got a tough job'' in running against the Clinton record of peace
and prosperity. ``I have a lot of sympathy with them,'' he said, a day after
sharp criticism from Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   --Said that Democratic rivals Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore were
``right to condemn'' Clinton's nomination of Republican Bradley Smith to the
Federal Election Commission. Clinton said that Smith ``hates campaign finance''
legislation but that he nominated him anyway simply to fill a Republican
vacancy, and Smith was the candidate favored by Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   --Refused to cast blame for the deepening crisis in the Northern Ireland
peace process. ``I don't think you can Monday morning quarterback that,'' the
president said. He said that the current crisis was ``a very unfortunate
development'' but that the IRA ``has given no indication whatever that they will
revert to violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And so that means that they still think, no matter what the rhetoric says,
that all the parties really believe that they ought to find a way to work this
out.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Farmers Sue Cigarette Makers  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tobacco farmers sued cigarette makers Wednesday for $69
billion, contending they conspired to undo the federal system that regulates
tobacco prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The class-action case argues that the companies, led by Philip Morris Inc.,
misled farmers into helping them stop congressional legislation in 1998 that
would have given growers $28 billion. The companies later reached a settlement
with the states that will provide growers with much less -- $5.15 billion over
12 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit has 4,010 plaintiffs who grow tobacco or own federal tobacco
quotas, the licenses that a farmer must either own or rent to sell the crop.
There are about 500,000 farmers and quota holders nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we're asking for and all we've ever asked for ... is to be treated
fairly. We haven't been treated fairly," said Lamar DeLoach, a Metter, Ga.,
grower.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys general of 14 tobacco-growing states are listed as coconspirators
in the lawsuit along with a Philip Morris lobbyist because of their role in
getting the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit opens a new legal front for the manufacturers, who last week
were sued by a group of wholesalers who accused them of fixing prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies deny any wrongdoing in either case. Jay Poole, a spokesman for
Philip Morris, said the growers' lawsuit was a "direct assault" on the states'
settlement with the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some lawyer has convinced a group of farmers that there is a pot of gold at
the end of this litigation," Poole said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lorillard Tobacco Co. said it believed frustrated growers filed the suit
in response to challenges from a changing marketplace. The cigarette maker
called the suit groundless and a frivolous endeavor organized and encouraged by
Washington, D.C., trial attorneys.
</P>
<P>
	   "We regret the action taken today by a small segment of the tobacco grower
community," Lorillard said in a written statement. "It is always unfortunate
when customers are sued by their suppliers. ... Lorillard continues to value the
relationship we have with the more than 100,000 tobacco farmers who have chosen
not to follow this ill-advised course."
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander Pires, the farmers' attorney, pledged to "break" the tobacco
companies "unless they pay their fair share" to the growers.
</P>
<P>
	   Pires, who sued McDonald's in the famous coffee-scalding case, won a
settlement last year in a racial discrimination case lawsuit against the
Agriculture Department that is expected to cost the government $1 billion. He
has a similar lawsuit pending against USDA on behalf of American Indian growers.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco farmers have seen their income decline sharply in recent years
because of declining consumption and increased imports of cheaper foreign leaf.
Since 1997, the amount of tobacco farmers are allowed to grow under the quota
system has been reduced by more than half. Small-scale farms that must rent
allotments have been especially hard hit.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA fixes the quotas each year based on the companies' purchasing
intentions, exports and existing tobacco stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The farmers who are suing the industry say the companies want to do away
with the quota system and contract directly with a select number of producers.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation that the growers helped the industry to defeat was intended
to settle state lawsuits against the companies and would have cost them $500
billion. The settlement they reached with the states will cost $206 billion. The
farmers say the companies made vague promises to "take care" of them if they
lobbied against the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Other farmers are opposed to the lawsuit, preferring to negotiate with the
companies instead.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't think it's time to give up yet," said Danny McKinney, chief
executive officer of the Burley Tobacco Grower's Cooperative in Lexington, Ky.
"You don't bite the hand that feeds you."
</P>
<P>
	   John Boyd, a Virginia grower, said the lawsuit could tie up states'
settlement and prevent farmers from getting their payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Imports of foreign tobacco, which is lower in quality than U.S. leaf, rose
sharply in the early 1990s because of the rise in popularity of discount
cigarettes, said USDA economist Tom Capehart. Less than 60 percent of the
tobacco in a cigarette is domestically grown.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court hears case of youngster barred from reading Bible  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A federal court took up the case Wednesday of a New
Jersey boy barred from reading his favorite Bible story to his first-grade
class.
<P>
	   The full 12-member panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals considered
the case involving Zachary Hood and his elementary school in Medford, N.J. The
full court decided to hear the case after throwing out a ruling by a
three-member panel of the 3rd Circuit that the Haines Elementary School did not
violate the boy's right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is whether Medford school officials acted properly in preventing
Zachary from reading the story and whether the case should be sent back to a
lower court.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, first-grade teacher Grace Oliva rewarded students for their reading
skills by allowing them to read a story of their choice to their classmates.
</P>
<P>
	   Zachary, who is Catholic, chose a story about Jacob and Esau from "The
Beginner's Bible: Timeless Children's Stories." Oliva told him the story was
inappropriate because of its religious content and origin, even though it had no
overt religious theme and didn't mention God.
</P>
<P>
	   The teacher allowed Zachary to read it to her in private, but would not let
him do so in front of the class. The boy's parents sought an apology and later
sued the school district for damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday was the fourth time the case has landed before the courts. Some
legal experts say it could define the boundaries for religion in public schools
and could ultimately land before the U.S. Supreme Court. The previous rulings
sided with the school district.
</P>
<P>
	   "This case is a perfect example of something that happens every day," said
Kevin Hasson, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Becket Fund for Religious
Liberty, which is representing the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Kids' religious expression gets squelched and in America free speech does
not become any less free just because someone wants to talk about God," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael P. Madden, an attorney representing the district, said the teacher
acted appropriately, given the young age of her students. The teacher, he said,
should be given the discretion to make such decisions without legal reprisal.
</P>
<P>
	   "She made the call. She acted reasonably," argued Madden. "We're dealing
with a first-grade class. The teachers have to be given some leeway to make
these calls."
</P>
<P>
	   Zachary, a freckle-faced 10-year-old, listened intently in court as
attorneys argued his case. Now a fourth-grader, he said he had no idea his Bible
story would cause such a legal battle.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the first time I've been to court," he told reporters after the
hearing. "I didn't know what a court was back then."
</P>
<P>
	   Zachary said he would choose the same story again, despite the controversy.
Asked why, he replied simply, "I don't know. I just would."
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel it's very important for Zachary and all the children in the
country," said his mother, Carol Hood. "We feel this could be a win-win
situation for us and the public school system."
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Morton Greenberg asked Hasson if the teacher, also named in the
lawsuit, could have believed it was her job to prevent Bible-reading in public
school.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenberg said it was clear that the teacher was faced with a difficult
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasson said the students were asked only to select a story that was
appropriate in length and reading level for the class and Zachary did that.
</P>
<P>
	   "The story that we're dealing with is so innocuous," Hasson argued in court.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was disallowed from reading the story because of its source,"
interjected Judge Theodore A. McKee. "It had a religious source."
</P>
<P>
	   Madden, the attorney for the school district, said he was concerned about
the impact that an adverse ruling could have on teachers forced to act as
constitutional scholars and theologians.
</P>
<P>
	   "They'll always be second-guessing themselves, wondering if they will get
sued," Madden said.	   The Bible story was Zachary's second religious run-in at
the Haines School.
</P>
<P>
	   Zachary wrote "Thankful for Jesus" on a poster for a Thanksgiving assignment
in kindergarten. A substitute teacher removed the poster from a school hallway
display, but it was returned to a less prominent display the following day by
his regular teacher.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the incident, Zachary left the school district; the family
moved to nearby Lumberton for reasons unrelated to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   After hearing oral arguments that lasted about an hour Wednesday, the court
took the case under advisement and gave no indication when it would rule.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defends Affirmative Action Ban  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID MARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush said Wednesday he had made some
improvements to his ban on affirmative action and said three public hearings on
the plan only strengthened his belief in it.
</P>
<P>
	   Changes to his ``One Florida'' plan include the creation of an
accountability commission that will gauge whether enough minorities are being
admitted into state universities over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican governor, however, refused to back off his executive order
banning racial preferences in university admissions and the awarding of state
contracts. The order was repeatedly criticized during three public hearings over
the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although I have learned much from listening, nothing I have heard has
convinced me that we should continue the status quo practices of quotas,
set-asides and price preferences,'' Bush said. ``In fact, the public dialogue
has further convinced me that the One Florida initiative is the right course to
pursue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other changes include a ``comprehensive and exhaustive'' review of the
program that guarantees state university admission to the top 20 percent of each
Florida high school's graduating class. Bush also said he will have Chancellor
Adam Herbert place an increased emphasis on diversity when evaluating the job
performance of each university president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's refusal to back off the One Florida plan caused four college students
to cancel talks with the governor's staff in protest. The students had won an
audience with Bush last week while about 1,000 students protested in the Capitol
rotunda.
</P>
<P>
	   The students, three from historically black Florida A&AMP;M University and the
other from Florida State University, said Bush's three-year admission
``accountability measure'' was already mandated by an existing federal consent
decree running through 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We reached a stalemate with the governor, because he won't move from his
position,'' said Andrew Gillum, a Florida A&AMP;M student. ``I didn't realize there
would be a real political spin put on our discussion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Countered Bush: ``I didn't think I was negotiating with anybody. I thought
we were taking suggestions on our plan.''

<HEADLINE> Japan First Woman Gov. Goes To Work  </HEADLINE>
   By GINNY PARKER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- By all accounts, Fusae Ota's election as Japan's first female
governor was a major victory for women in a political world that remains the
realm of men.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, after just a week in office, she is taking on another battle -- against
Japan's last bastion of unabashed machismo, the world of sumo.
</P>
<P>
	   As governor of Japan's second-largest city, Osaka, Ota is entitled to
present an award to the winner of a sumo wrestling tournament next month. But
sumo officials are refusing to let her in the ring because she is a woman -- and
women, they say, are impure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to protect Japan's traditional culture,'' said Ayako Suzuki of the
Sumo Association. ``We ask the governor to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sumo's ancient roots are entwined with Japan's indigenous Shinto religion,
and by custom the sumo ring is considered sacred. For centuries, only men have
been allowed inside.
</P>
<P>
	   Only one other woman has ever been in a position to challenge that before.
</P>
<P>
	   As chief Cabinet secretary, Mayumi Moriyama was set to present the prime
minister's award at a sumo tournament in 1990, but backed down after the issue
became too divisive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's been 10 years since then,'' Ota told the nationally-circulated Asahi
newspaper. ``As the first woman governor, I want to try again.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ota, a conservative, does not claim to be a feminist. But the controversy
surrounding her push to present the award underscores just how much of a men's
club politics remains in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Women have been active in Japanese politics since they were granted legal
equality after World War II. A few have risen to Cabinet posts or senior
positions in opposition parties. One, Takako Doi, was a contender for prime
minister in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, it is clearly a man's world.
</P>
<P>
	   Teiko Kihira, chairwoman of the League of Women Voters of Japan, warned that
Ota's success is a special case, and that women in politics are still a tiny
minority.
</P>
<P>
	   In Parliament, women hold 17 percent of the seats in the upper house and 5
percent in the more powerful lower house, even though women have the highest
voting rates in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't say that it's gotten easier for women to get into politics,''
said Kihira, a former lawmaker. ``They're still like ribbons and accessories.''
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the reason for the dearth of women in Parliament is the traditional
expectation that a woman forgo whatever career aspirations she might have to
marry and raise a family.
</P>
<P>
	   But that, too, is changing.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past few months, women politicians have rallied behind Seiko
Hashimoto, a former Olympic speed skater who was elected to Parliament in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Hashimoto, who is pregnant, is pressing Parliament to change its bylaws to
allow for maternity leave. Childbirth is not included on the list of reasons for
which members may miss sessions. Only one other lawmaker has been pregnant
during a session of Parliament, and that was 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are still some old-fashioned attitudes left in Japan,'' said
Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
	   Change is occurring, albeit slowly.
</P>
<P>
	   Laws banning discrimination in hiring and promotion have been passed, and
the public is becoming more comfortable with the idea of women on the career
track.
</P>
<P>
	   Ota rose through the ranks of the Trade Ministry before going on to become
vice-governor of Okayama state in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Her success at the polls also reflects a shift in attitudes regarding what
men in powerful positions can and cannot do.
</P>
<P>
	   Her predecessor, former comedian ``Knock'' Yokoyama, enjoyed great
popularity as governor until a university student accused him of molesting her
while she worked on his campaign. A civil court ordered him to pay damages for
sexual harassment and he stepped down amid public outrage.

<HEADLINE> Businessman points to pressure to fund campaigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Mystic businessman told lawmakers Wednesday he
was denied a state business loan after refusing to hand over $30,000 to a former
"high ranking" state Treasury official.
<P>
	   John Haggerty gave few details to the Legislature's Government
Administration and Elections Committee, but said the payoff would be used to
fund campaigns. He said he has not shared his accusation with any law
enforcement officials, and state officials immediately discounted his story.
</P>
<P>
	   Haggerty testified at a hearing on campaign finance reform in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that after meeting with Department of Economic and Community
Development Commissioner James Abromaitis on Feb. 16, 1999, he was "introduced
to a former high ranking state treasury official."
</P>
<P>
	   He refused to identify the official.
</P>
<P>
	   "In that meeting, this person told me I would need to supply $30,000 so he
could get Gov. (John G.) Rowland to approve the project," Haggerty said. "He
said the money would be used to fund campaigns. I was also told how the funds
should be handled. I am not suggesting that this individual was acting on
instruction from the governor. However, I was shocked, disgusted and afraid."
</P>
<P>
	   Haggerty said that when he refused to hand over the $30,000, he was denied
state assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani said Haggerty's claims are without merit.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor would not be involved in approving a project like this,
anyway," Pagani said. "It would be done at the agency level. It doesn't make
sense. What he's saying happened wasn't even in an election year."
</P>
<P>
	   About seven months after Haggerty's meeting with Abromaitis, former state
Treasurer Paul Silvester pleaded guilty to federal racketeering and
money-laundering charges related to his failed 1998 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Silvester admitted to investing state pension money with companies in
exchange for kickbacks to himself, his family and his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Department of Economic and Community Development confirmed
they were working with Haggerty, and said they denied him financial assistance
because his project did not qualify for assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   But DECD spokesman Jim Watson said Haggerty was never pressured to pay
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
	   "His accusation is without any merit and not based on fact," Watson said.
"It's well known that this agency does not operate in that fashion."
</P>
<P>
	   Watson said he did not have any details of Haggerty's proposal, and Haggerty
would not provide details. Haggerty is the former owner of C.C. Bagel Company, a
chain which had several stores throughout New London County.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature is considering two campaign finance reform plans which call
for different campaign spending caps. Both plans would allow residents to fund
campaigns through checkoffs on their state income tax return. The system would
take money away from the individual's refund, rather than use money out of the
state's General Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Both plans call for public financing of races for governor and
constitutional offices such as attorney general and treasurer. Neither plan
includes public financing of legislative races.
</P>
<P>
	   Some leading Republicans say it will be impossible to publicly fund
campaigns with voluntary checkoffs, and argued that capping campaign spending
infringes on free speech.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really think they are all attempts to limit political speech, which I
find too precious," said House Minority Leader Robert Ward, R-Northfield. "The
weighing and balancing ought not to be focused on limiting free speech."

<HEADLINE> Small Business Care Plans Under Fire  </HEADLINE>
   By LIBBY QUAID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House-passed bill designed to make it cheaper for small
businesses to provide health insurance actually would boost premiums for some
and do little to trim the number of uninsured Americans, according to a
Congressional Budget Office report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   James Baumgardner, the nonpartisan CBO's acting deputy assistant director
for health policy, told the House Small Business Committee the bill would have
little impact on the 43 million Americans who do not have health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On balance, about 330,000 more people would be covered through small-firm
employment than would otherwise have been the case,'' he said. ``That represents
a 1.3 percent increase in coverage through small firms.''
</P>
<P>
	   The measure's chief supporter, Rep. Jim Talent, R-Mo., called the study ``an
insult to the intelligence of small business.''
</P>
<P>
	   When the bill was introduced last year, supporters said it would allow small
firms to band together to pool risks and curb costs while expanding health care
coverage for the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
	   But the report said new plans would attract healthier workers and leave
sicker individuals in the existing pool, increasing costs for those left in the
traditional insurance market. The CBO also said premiums would rise for many who
switch to the new plans, in part because of administrative overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   The CBO report, coupled with President Clinton's failure to include the
bill's language in his latest health care proposals, makes it unlikely the
measure will survive upcoming House-Senate negotiations on health care
legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Talent, the committee chairman, lashed out at the CBO, saying the study
dramatically underestimates the legislation's impact.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters pointed to a July 1998 study by the National Federation of
Independent Business foundation projecting that 4.5 million more workers and
family members would join the small-group plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is unfair that a small, Main Street hardware store cannot access the
same economies of scale, administrative efficiencies and purchasing clout that
Home Depot and other large businesses enjoy when purchasing health insurance,''
Talent said.
</P>
<P>
	   Small business interests support the measure, saying it has vast potential
to expand the pooled coverage beyond the 4 million currently covered. The
measure gives small businesses the option to buy insurance under federal rather
than state regulation -- exempting them from state mandates that larger,
self-insured companies now avoid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would cost me over $40,000 per year for my small company to give
everyone, including my family, health care insurance,'' said Richard Gallo,
owner of an Indiana, Pa., office supply store. ``With four young children, a
mortgage, bills and other expenses, there is not much cash in the savings
account.''
</P>
<P>
	   Blue Cross-Blue Shield and other foes argue that small-group plans would
destabilize the insurance market.
</P>
<P>
	   The net result will be higher premiums for smaller firms ``and a return to a
small-group insurance market driven by aggressive selection of the best risks,''
said Mary Nell Lehnard, senior vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield
Association.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reinforcements Arrive in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.N. police reinforcements began
arriving in this ethnically divided town on Wednesday, following two weeks of
violence that left nine people dead and dozens injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-seven police officers were redeployed to the northern, Serb-majority
part of Kosovska Mitrovica. Another six officers arrived from Bulgaria, U.N.
police said.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of 300 officers are to be sent to Kosovska Mitrovica, top U.N.
administrator Bernard Kouchner said.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the upsurge in violence, more reinforcements were needed, and not
just in Kosovska Mitrovica, but throughout the province of Kosovo, U.N.
Assistant Secretary-General Hedi Annabi told the Security Council on Wednesday
at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the new troops, there were only 2,052 of the 4,000-plus civilian
police needed to take over law enforcement in Kosovo from the NATO troops.
Special police units who can handle riots and other such incidents have yet to
arrive.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations has had to rely on NATO peacekeepers because there
weren't enough U.N. civilian police to do the job, Annabi said in a closed
briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations has consistently appealed to countries to volunteer
civilian police and to better fund the U.N. Mission in Kosovo, which Annabi said
only had enough money to last through March.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, two rockets were fired at a Serb house in the northern part of
the town, but caused no injuries, NATO said. Another rocket launched in the Suvi
Do area, on the outskirts of southern Kosovska Mitrovica, landed in a field and
did not explode, NATO added.
</P>
<P>
	   Groups of angry Serbs also prevented an ethnic Albanian television crew
escorted by French soldiers from entering the northern sector. The cameraman was
slightly injured when he was pushed into barbed wire by a group of about 10
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Kouchner also appointed a new regional police commissioner for the town,
Sven Erik Larsen from Denmark. The previous commissioner, Philip Mailhes, was
transferred to the provincial capital of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
	   The move comes after NATO peacekeeping troops fought battles in northern
Kosovska Mitrovica on Sunday with a number of gunmen after two French
peacekeepers were shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Peacekeepers shot and killed one ethnic Albanian who they said was firing at
them, and injured another two. But local ethnic Albanians said the man who was
killed, a former Kosovo Liberation Army fighter, was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
	   In Pristina on Wednesday, a five-nation international delegation met with
Kouchner and Kosovo officials and warned them to ``take responsibility'' in
ending violence there if they want continued support in building an autonomous
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The delegation -- including France, Germany, Italy, Britain and the United
States -- stressed that the international community ``has made a considerable
financial and personal investment in Kosovo,'' and so had a right to ask Kosovar
officials to resume their responsibility.
</P>
<P>
	   A rocket attack on a U.N. bus which killed two Serb civilians on Feb. 2
sparked the latest round of violence. Clashes between ethnic Albanians and
French peacekeepers on the southern part of the bridge over the next days left
dozens more injured, including 16 French peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Father Wants Update on Son  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father said in a letter published Wednesday
that he wants Cuban diplomats based in Washington to meet with his 6-year-old
son in Miami and check on his condition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are worried not only about his prolonged kidnapping,'' Juan Miguel
Gonzalez wrote in a letter published on the front page of the Communist Party
daily Granma. ``We lack direct information about the concrete conditions to
which he is subjected in his daily life.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate response from the U.S. government to the request. It
was likely to be opposed by Elian's Miami relatives, who are fighting to keep
the boy in the United States and who have said they think Gonzalez is being
controlled by Fidel Castro's government.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of former fighters in the revolution that brought Castro to power
42 years ago gathered Wednesday night to denounce the Miami ``worms'' who
support Elian's being kept in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   With Castro and other historic revolutionary leaders sitting in the front
row of Havana's Conventions Palace, a string of former guerrillas called for the
return of ``our Elian'' to his father on the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez had written a letter earlier this week to Attorney General Janet
Reno, demanding Elian be returned to him and saying he did not recognize the
courts hearing the custody battle. The Justice Department said it was reviewing
that letter.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez's second letter to Reno in two weeks was published in Granma on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I formally object to the legal moves made or being made by those who are
arbitrarily retaining Elian,'' Gonzalez said in the letter, dated Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the letter, Gonzalez said he does not recognize the jurisdiction of the
U.S. court system, which is weighing an attempt by Elian's Miami relatives to
block his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the focus of an international custody battle since he was
found on an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. The boy's mother and 10
other people died when their boat sank on the way from Cuba to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian is staying with his paternal great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, who is
fighting to keep the boy with him in the United States. Cuban exiles in Miami
say the boy's mother died to give him freedom in the United States, while the
Cuban government maintains Elian is being improperly kept from his father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Juan Miguel must not have written the letter himself,'' said Armando
Gutierrez, spokesman for Elian's relatives in Miami. ``Castro must be dreaming
for the family to allow Cuban spies inside Lazaro Gonzalez's home.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the relatives in Miami filed a brief in federal court on Monday
arguing the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot return Elian to Cuba
without holding a political asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. government lawyers have moved to dismiss the Miami relatives' lawsuit,
arguing that they have no legal standing in the boy's case. The INS ruled last
month that only Elian's father has the right to speak for the boy in immigration
matters.

<HEADLINE> DNA Leads to Charge in 1981 Murder  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN FINUCANE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Patrick Durham walked away from police custody in 1981 after
investigators decided they didn't have enough evidence to charge him with the
brutal stabbing of a 14-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly two decades later, prosecutors said DNA evidence taken from a bandage
that had been wrapped around Durham's hand links him to the killing of Mary
Burhoe, who was stabbed more than 100 times.
</P>
<P>
	   Durham, 37, pleaded innocent to murder at his arraignment Wednesday.
Although he is serving time at the state prison in Norfolk for an unrelated drug
conviction, he was ordered held without bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Burhoe's body was found July 11, 1981, in a burning field near the Mystic
River.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses saw Durham the night before demand sex and threaten Burhoe with a
knife, said Suffolk County prosecutor David Meier. Burhoe bit Durham on the left
thigh and on the right hand during a struggle, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested Durham the day Burhoe's body was found, but authorities have
said there was not enough evidence to charge him. Police kept the bandage Durham
had on his right hand.
</P>
<P>
	   That bandage, with the advent of DNA fingerprinting technology, provided a
crucial break in the case. Investigators matched blood from the bandage with
blood found on the jeans of Burhoe, Meier said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyer Jamie Sultan said they would be taking a close look at the
DNA evidence.

<HEADLINE> Report cards show fourth-graders failing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - For the first time, the state's school report
cards, released Wednesday, will show parents how their fourth-graders are
faring.
<P>
	   Many are sure to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 60 percent of fourth-graders failed the reading and writing portion
of the test.
</P>
<P>
	   In math, 40 percent of fourth-graders flunked. But nearly 90 percent passed
the science portion of the test.
</P>
<P>
	   These test results were released late last year, but it's the first time
they appear on the report cards that are distributed to parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike on other tests, where most of the failure occurs in poor cities, many
kids in nice, suburban towns also flunked the new fourth-grade test.
</P>
<P>
	   The dismal results led the New Jersey School Boards Association to ask state
officials Wednesday to replace the existing test with a standard, national one.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Calvo, chair of the association's committee on testing, told the state
School Board that the state test does not help teachers assess where their
students need help. A national, standardized test would do the job better, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Education Commissioner David Hespe said it will be tough to find a
standard test that fits New Jersey's needs.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very difficult to find a national test that actually assesses the
breadth and depth of our own core curriculum content standards in New Jersey,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that the state is taking steps to shorten the test and allow
students to take part of the test in fourth grade and the rest in fifth,
addressing major complaints from school districts.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most of the administrative issues, we've absolutely addressed," Hespe said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report cards are intended to provide parents with a snapshot of their
child's school.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to test scores, they provide information on how much a district
spends on classroom and administrative costs, attendance rates and teacher
salaries, among other data.
</P>
<P>
	   School districts distribute them to parents to show how a school measures up
against others in the state and whether the school is improving over the years.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-grade scores will be a sharp change for many parents in suburban
districts who are used to seeing high test scores.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the state's top-spending school district - Alpine in Bergen
County - saw about 58 percent of its fourth-graders fail the language arts
portion of the test. The tiny borough spends more than $15,000 per student,
compared to the state average of $9,872.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hunterdon County, 70 percent of fourth-graders in Clinton Town failed the
language arts test, even though students there regularly score high on
high-school tests. And in Mercer County, nearly 57 percent of fourth-graders at
Wicoff Elementary in wealthy West Windsor-Plainsboro failed the test.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-grade tests, though, are an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
	   Historically, students who attend school in wealthier towns post higher test
scores. And this year is no different, the report cards show. But spending alone
doesn't dictate results.
</P>
<P>
	   Mountain Lakes in Morris County, for example, spends $12,389 per student and
sees 100 percent of its students pass the high-school tests. Montgomery Township
in Somerset County, though, spends far less - $8,463 per student and gets
similar results. About 99 percent of its students passed the high-school test
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Still other districts are among the top-spenders - and got the lowest test
scores in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   About 20 percent of the top 50 spenders are "special needs" districts, which
post some of the worst test scores in the state. Those include Trenton, Camden
and Asbury Park.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 30 special needs districts in New Jersey that receive special
state funding. Eleven are among the top 50 spenders in the state.

<HEADLINE> Mystery Surrounds Scientist's Murder  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE LOCKE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) -- On Oct. 20, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
designer Lee Scott Hall was found lying face down in his bedroom, beaten and
stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, police discovered Hall knew about a flaw in the lab's super laser, a
$1.2 billion project called the National Ignition Facility that has been plagued
by projected delays and cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
	   Four months later, police are still trying to unravel the mystery: Did
Hall's job at the weapons lab somehow lead to his death?
</P>
<P>
	   Lab officials say no.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know of no connection between Mr. Hall's death and his work on the
National Ignition Facility. He was an important member of our team but to infer
that he found a problem and was a whistle-blower is just not accurate,'' said
lab spokeswoman Susan Houghton.
</P>
<P>
	   Police had been quoted as theorizing that Hall may have angered a co-worker,
but they declined comment on that this week.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Livermore Police Chief Ron Scott said some of the information in
stories about the whistle-blower theory was ``correct, some based on
speculation, and some inaccurate.'' He declined to identify which was which,
saying ``I don't want to feed into anything else that's going on.''
</P>
<P>
	   The super laser is designed to test nuclear weapons by using simulations
instead of underground tests. Plans call for it to be the size of a football
stadium; it will be able to fire 192 laser beams onto a target the size of BB to
simulate temperatures and pressures similar to those inside a nuclear explosion
or at the sun's core.
</P>
<P>
	   It is a cornerstone of the nuclear weapons program, but it became a source
of embarrassment to lab officials last September with revelations it might be
five years late and $350 million over budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson immediately demanded to know why he'd been
assured only months earlier the project was in good shape, setting off a round
of investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   Livermore officials said Hall, 54, had been working to fix a design flaw on
the super laser. But Hall's boss, Richard Foley, said Hall was part of a team
looking into a potential problem and the flaw in question was pointed out by
someone else when Hall was on vacation. The problem is relatively small -- not
part of the major troubles forcing the delays -- and could be fixed for around
$1 million, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody here was working on the same problem,'' he said. ``There was
nobody that got punished for it at all. Nobody has been nor anybody will be.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was Foley and another lab worker who found Hall's body, when they went to
his house after he failed to show up for work.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall lived alone and there was no sign of forced entry or robbery and little
sign of a struggle. He was stabbed repeatedly.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Heating Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, saying too many families are being
hurt by the soaring cost of heating their homes, announced Wednesday he will ask
Congress for $600 million in emergency assistance to help people meet heating
oil costs. He also released an additional $125 million for more immediate help
to low-income families.
</P>
<P>
	   The emergency appropriation, if acted on by lawmakers, could be too late for
families, especially in the Northeast, struggling to cope with heating oil
prices that in many cases has more than doubled from last year. Clinton said he
hoped there would be fast action by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans have always pulled together to help their fellow citizens in
time of need,'' Clinton said. ``Now the families of the Northeast need our help
too, and we must act.''
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came as Energy Secretary Bill Richardson held a meeting
with New England state energy officials and oil industry representatives in
Boston and in Bangor, Maine on the skyrocketing prices of heating oil this
winter.
</P>
<P>
	   New England officials had been lobbying the president to release the
remaining low-income, or LIHEAP, assistance funds. The administration already
had released $200 million, distributed nationwide. The latest money was being
earmarked for hardest hit states, mostly in the Northeast where people rely
heavily on oil to heat their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   There are between 10 million and 14 million homes that are heated by oil,
according to industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., applauded the president's decision, but
joined other Northeast lawmakers in saying more needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeffords said refiners should be pushed to boost heating oil production, and
the government should establish a reserve of home heating oil in the Northeast
to deal with sudden price spikes and supply disruptions. Legislation for such a
reserve was introduced in Congress this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Northeast lawmakers also have urged the administration to release oil
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but Richardson has said repeatedly he has
no such intentions. The reserve is designed for supply disruptions and not to
influence prices, administration officials have maintained.
</P>
<P>
	   There is also concern that if the strategic reserve were tapped it would
make it more difficult to convince OPEC oil producers to increase production
when they meet next month to consider future production strategies. OPEC
producers a year ago agreed to reduce production by 4.3 million barrels a day,
triggering prices to soar to $30 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, said the release of new federal assistance was
``welcome news'' as his state faced with more snow with another arctic blast
expected this weekend. Richardson flew to Bangor, Maine to hear complaints about
the heating oil situation.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he ordered the release of the last $125 million in the Low
Income Home Energy Assistance Program for this year. While the money is
earmarked for the poor, Clinton said states facing the biggest heating oil
problem could adjust the requirements so some middle income families also might
qualify.
</P>
<P>
	   The heating oil cost crunch also has become an issue in the Senate race
between first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her likely Republican rival, New
York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Giuliani has urged Clinton to address the problem
by releasing oil from the strategic reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Giuliani attacked Clinton over the rising home heating oil
prices, saying the president ``should stand up to OPEC'' and release oil from
the emergency reserve. Many oil industry analysts question whether releasing
reserves would have much impact on heating oil prices this winter.
</P>
<P>
	   The LIHEAP funds are normally available to people whose incomes are no
higher than 150 percent of the poverty line, or 60 percent of the medium income
in their states.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton said middle income families also ``are really hurt by an
increase of $200 to $300 a month in their home heating bill'' and should be
considered eligible for assistance. States can raise the income limits, he said.

<HEADLINE> Community unhappy, but not surprised, by exoneration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - In the impoverished North End neighborhood where
Aquan Salmon was killed, a dozen people gathered Wednesday for an impromptu
prayer.
<P>
	   They sought spiritual guidance - and expressed frustration that the white
police officer who killed the black, 14-year-old mugging suspect had been
cleared by a state investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's messed up how the cop got off, because he's only a kid. He's
somebody's brother; somebody's baby," said Carmen Melendez, who lives in the
neighborhood where Salmon was killed last April 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Melendez brought her 5-year-old daughter, Catalina, and her nieces and
nephews to what remains of a makeshift memorial to Salmon. Candles, a teddy
bear, broken statues and plastic flowers lay amid snow and mud. Spray-painted on
a brick wall were tributes to "Quanny."
</P>
<P>
	   "I came here with the children to do a prayer because they asked how he
died," said Melendez.
</P>
<P>
	   The children placed their palms together and bowed their heads as they
recalled a boy they never met.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Cornell Lewis, pastor of the North End Church of Christ, came to
the scene "just trying to find certain people and let certain people find me to
offer counseling."
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis led the group in prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I pray also, Father, in the days and months to come, that if Officer Robert
Allan is guilty that you judge him," said Lewis. "We pray, Father, in your
divine justice that you not let this man go if he is guilty."
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis and others were frustrated at being kept out of a meeting earlier in
the day between investigators and Salmon's family. Had they been allowed inside,
they could have shared the information with others, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're asking the community to act crazy because they're shutting them
out," said Wendy Moore. "They create a who's-who. Everybody should be a
who's-who. It makes a difference when people can learn it for themselves."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday evening, about two dozen people returned to Phillips
Metropolitan CME Church, where the morning meeting was held. Most came for a
bible study, but they listened as the Rev. James Walker spoke about the
investigation. Walker then asked the media to leave so that the public would
feel comfortable expressing their feelings or opinions.
</P>
<P>
	   "People were concerned that the report didn't leave people who gathered with
a feeling of closure," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other churches and a mosque in the North End opened their doors Wednesday
night as social workers joined clergy in an effort to address the concerns of
residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Several members of Salmon's family gathered at his grandmother's house.
</P>
<P>
	   Police prepared for the possibilty of violence by sending out teams of
officers. Each cruiser was staffed with a driver, a supervisor, a video
technician and a specially trained disorder-control or emergency-response
officer.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no reports of violence early Wednesday evening.

<HEADLINE> Court orders new trial for man because prosecutor hinted at other  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A state appeals court issued a stern warning to
prosecutors Wednesday against hinting to a jury that a person on trial may have
committed other offenses.
<P>
	   In so ruling, the two-judge panel ordered a new trial for an Essex County
man identified only as "F.M.," reversing his 18-year prison sentence for
sexually molesting and raping his 3-year-old son during weekend visits.
</P>
<P>
	   The court found fault with testimony from the man's older stepsons who said
they had been hit by F.M. and that they feared him, and that they had witnessed
violence against their baby brother.
</P>
<P>
	   The appellate judges said there are circumstances in which a jury may hear
such evidence of prior crimes as a prosecutor seeks to rebut testimony from the
defense. But the judges said this information must be presented carefully within
strict limits.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing as an example the prosecutor's summation to the jury, Judges David
Baime and Barbara Wecker in their joint opinion quoted him as telling the jury,
"I am not going to say he did something horrible in the past so he is a bad
person. I can't do any of that."
</P>
<P>
	   The judges said this remark "conjures up a criminal history that does not
exist."
</P>
<P>
	   "It is also error to permit a prosecutor to comment in such a way as to
imply that the prosecutor knows something the jury does not," the court said.
</P>
<P>
	   F.M. in 1989 married a woman who had two sons from a previous marriage. In
1990 they had a son, in 1991 they separated and later they divorced. F.M.
brought the baby boy to his home for weekends for two years until visitation was
cut off in 1993 after the mother filed sexual assault complaints with police.
</P>
<P>
	   During the man's trial, his defense attorney argued the claims were
preposterous because F.M. for 34 years had had no blemish on his record or
character, and that the boy's mother simply wanted to end visitation.
</P>
<P>
	   To rebut this claim, prosecutors put the two former stepsons on the stand to
testify that F.M. used to hit them. One boy testified, "I'd get scared of him
sometimes."
</P>
<P>
	   The trial judge permitted the testimony but the appeals court said the judge
should have made sure the jury understood the limits of how it was to be
regarded. "Suffice it to say that at a minimum, a strong limiting instruction
was essential," the judges said.
</P>
<P>
	   This error was compounded when the prosecutor hinted at these offenses
later.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is impossible to know what the jury drew from that combination of
evidence and argument. But it seems plain to us that they could have inferred
that defendant had abused the other children in the past, and that but for the
rules to which the prosecutor alluded, they would have heard all about it," the
judges said.
</P>
<P>
	   They said it is conceivable one or more jurors "was led to a guilty verdict
when, absent these conditions, it might have found a reasonable doubt that
defendant was the person responsible."

<HEADLINE> Manhunt for Fugitive Ends in Wyo.  </HEADLINE>
   By MEAD GRUVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- A manhunt over two states and more than 200 miles
ended when a rancher persuaded a Texas survivalist accused of murder to put down
his weapons, then invited him inside to eat and called police.
</P>
<P>
	   Police slipped into the house late Tuesday and quickly handcuffed Charles
Moses Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It sounds like maybe he was cold and tired and ready to give up,'' Sgt.
Perry Jones of the Wyoming Highway Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moses limped into his initial federal court appearance on Wednesday. He was
assigned a public defender and a hearing was set for Friday to determine whether
he will be returned to Nebraska, where he is accused of killing a farmer and
wounding two police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The manhunt began Saturday when a Lincoln County, Neb., deputy tried to
arrest Moses on Texas charges of theft and evading arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Moses escaped in his truck and later got into a high-speed shootout with
officers in which one officer was shot in the abdomen and another in the hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Two days later, farmer Robert Sedlacek, 48, was found shot to death near an
abandoned farmhouse in western Nebraska. A first-degree murder warrant was
issued Tuesday for Moses, who police believed killed Sedlacek to steal his
pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
	   Rancher Carol Geisinger, whose property borders Jim Kremers', said she was
in her barn when a mud-covered pickup truck sped past Tuesday night and onto
Kremers' property, tearing out fences along the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Kremers and his son Justin were in the yard and heard the dogs barking. Then
they saw Moses, with a rifle and pistol, stumble into a yard light, yelling.
</P>
<P>
	   They talked him into putting down the gun -- Justin also had a rifle pointed
at Moses -- and then let him inside the house, knowing they were setting a trap.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said 'I am another God fearing person, and If I were going to shoot
you, I would have already shot you,''' Kremers said. ``Then the man made three
or four steps toward me and engulfed me in an embrace and cried continuously for
four or five minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I felt sorry for him.''
</P>
<P>
	   While Moses talked to his parents by phone and ate hotdogs, Kremers
contacted police. The officers were inside the house before Moses realized what
was happening, he said.

<HEADLINE> Judge orders Waterbury to release more water into river  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) - A Superior Court judge on Wednesday ordered the
city of Waterbury to release more water into the Shepaug River in a dispute that
pitted the city against environmentalists and two rural towns, officials said.
<P>
	   "I am very ecstatic and very pleased," said Roxbury First Selectman Barbara
Henry. "I think it is a victory for the Shepaug River Association and for all
the people who knew all along that there is plenty of water for everyone."
</P>
<P>
	   Conservationists from Roxbury and Washington sued the city in 1997, saying
Waterbury does not release enough water into the Shepaug River from an upstream
watershed.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit claimed that the city's actions affect the river, especially in
the summer when it dries to a trickle in some places. The river runs through the
towns of Warren, Washington and Roxbury before it empties into the Housatonic
River.
</P>
<P>
	   The city diverts water from the Shepaug watershed and pipes it to a
reservoir system closer to Waterbury. Without the Shepaug water, the city would
have to impose severe water restrictions in the summer, city attorneys have
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The city releases between 1.5 million and 5 million gallons of water into
the river each day, Henry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Beverly Hodgson ordered Waterbury to release 34.3 million gallons a
day in May, 13.8 million gallons per day in June, 7.6 million in July, 6.5
million in August, 6.1 million in September and 9.8 million on October, Henry
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a fight that was well worth fighting," she said."I think the river
is going to be much better off than when we started."
</P>
<P>
	   Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano said he was satisfied with the decision. He
said the city had offered a settlement that would have put even more water back
in the river.
</P>
<P>
	   "She also indicated that in extreme drought conditions those numbers would
not be required, and that was very important," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bank of NY Exec Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Bank of New York executive and her husband pleaded
guilty Wednesday to laundering billions of dollars from Russian bankers in one
of the biggest such schemes in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
	   The pleas were the first major admissions of wrongdoing since the
investigation caused an international scandal last August and strained relations
between Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing side by side, Lucy Edwards, 41, and Peter Berlin, 46, each told a
federal judge how they used Edwards' position as a vice president in the bank's
Eastern European division to help Russian bankers launder more than $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators believe most of the money came from Russian importers trying
to avoid taxes, though they are looking into whether some came from Russian
mobsters. No one directly addressed the matter in court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But a prosecutor did say that $300,000 of the laundered money was ransom for
a kidnapping in Russia. And Edwards said the bankers she teamed up with in 1995
at the Russian bank DKB had some sinister connections.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was aware that personnel for DKB were on occasion in fear of their
customers and afraid to leave the bank because they said customers with machine
guns were waiting for them," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also said Russian banking officials were accomplices in the scam.
The administration of former President Boris Yeltsin has called the Bank of New
York allegations a creation by the West to tarnish Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards and Berlin, a Russian businessman, surrendered to the FBI on Tuesday
after flying to New York from London, where they had been living.
</P>
<P>
	   They could face up to 10 years in prison at sentencing May 3 but could get
lesser sentences by identifying others involved. They also agreed to surrender
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI's New York office, called
the pleas a significant development but said "much remains to be done" in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   T. Barry Kingham, an attorney for Edwards and Berlin, said the couple will
keep cooperating with investigators. "They are anxious to fulfill their
obligations here and resume a normal life," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smiling frequently during the hearing, Edwards described creating an illegal
banking network for Russians -- without required licenses -- that was run
through accounts at the Bank of New York. The Bank of New York was not accused
of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Money laundering involves moving deposits through a series of accounts to
disguise their illicit source. In this case, Edwards and her husband set up
accounts at Bank of New York for shell companies with offices in New York City
and Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank provided the companies with software that was then used by the
Russians to transfer money, cheating the Russian government out of customs
duties and tax revenue, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said she "suspected the accounts were being used by many people for
illicit purposes."
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange, Edwards and her husband were paid $1.8 million, a percentage of
the money being moved, she said. "We were paid substantial commissions for doing
very little work," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also said that after the couple moved to London in 1996, they paid a
Bank of New York employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, $500 a month to make sure the
accounts were operating properly.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev was indicted last month on perjury charges for allegedly lying
to a federal grand jury about whether she or her husband had ever received money
or loans from Edwards. Kudryavtsev's lawyer has said any money she received was
a product of her friendship with Edwards.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also admitted she used her position at the Bank of New York to help
hundreds of Russians, most of them affiliated with the Russian banking industry,
to enter the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy to commit money
laundering and operating an unlawful banking business. Each will remain free on
$500,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   An alleged accomplice in the money transfers, Aleskey Volkov, remains a
fugitive.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Offer New Campaign Ads  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, continuing his upbeat focus on
character and courage, returns to the themes that launched his campaign in a new
TV commercial.
</P>
<P>
	   Closing out the South Carolina race, Gov. George W. Bush also has a new ad
that continues to hammer McCain with a nod to the issues that are at the center
of McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley are stepping up their
advertising as they move closer to March 7, when Democrats vote in 15 states.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's ad, filled with adoring crowds and red, white and blue bunting, was
designed to address questions about whether McCain can defeat Bush, and then the
Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   An announcer declares McCain is ``a Republican like Ronald Reagan who can
win.'' Then McCain tells a crowd: ``I'm gonna beat Al Gore like a drum.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ad also returns to the campaign's initial themes, with the announcer
saying McCain has ``the character to do what's right'' and ``the courage to
fight for it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's ad continues to hammer McCain for negative campaigning even though
McCain stopped running such ads last week. It also accuses McCain of bashing
Bush in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad also mentions Bush's new proposal on campaign financing and McCain's
occasional support for taxpayer-funded campaigns. McCain has acknowledged these
votes but said they were in the context of larger legislation he supported.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's ad also doesn't mention that the presidential campaign itself is
taxpayer-funded and that Bush plans to accept government funding if he becomes
the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Bradley was releasing a new television ad on
abortion Thursday, his second on the issue. Bradley and Gore agree on abortion
now, but Bradley has hammered the vice president for his early, mixed record,
including opposition to Medicaid funding for abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   The spot comes two days after Gore's endorsement by a leading abortion
rights group.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also released a new ad Wednesday, a remake of a New Hampshire spot
depicting him as a fighter who took on polluters, efforts to cut Medicare, and
insurance companies opposed to a ``patients bill of rights.'' The ad also takes
a subtle shot at Bradley over his proposal to replace Medicaid with a new
program by referring to the vice president as the only candidate ``committed to
preserving Medicaid.'' Gore routinely criticizes Bradley's health care plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad began running in California on Wednesday, putting Gore, Bradley and
the two Republican candidates on the air in the nation's largest state. Gore ran
a batch of TV ads last fall, but the newest spot opened his campaign in the
final stretch leading to the March 7 primary.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rejects Ending Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton rejected calls for a national
moratorium on capital punishment Wednesday but urged the nation's governors to
``look very closely'' at their death penalty systems to make sure that innocent
people are not executed.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it was courageous of Illinois Gov. George Ryan to impose a freeze on
executions after the exoneration of 13 death row inmates in his state over two
decades. Clinton said death penalty supporters -- including himself -- have ``an
especially heavy obligation'' to make sure there is no question of guilt for
condemned prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   At an hourlong news conference ranging from domestic subjects to foreign
policy, Clinton refused to say whether he will challenge ethics complaints
seeking to strip him of his Arkansas law license because of his conduct in the
Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he paid $850,000 last year to settle a related case -- the sexual
harassment suit of Paula Jones -- only to prevent it from being a distraction to
his presidency. He said the suit ``had absolutely no merit.'' The federal judge
in the Jones case found Clinton in contempt of court for giving false testimony
regarding his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   On another subject, Clinton said he has not ruled out a visit to Pakistan
next month when he visits its arch rival, India. He said his decision would
hinge on whether stopping in Islamabad could stop the regional arms race,
promote democracy in military-ruled Pakistan and resolve the India-Pakistan
conflict. He said the United States would be happy to help mediate the dispute
over Kashmir, but only if both countries seek help.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon striding into the East Room for his first regular news conference of
the year, Clinton announced the release of $125 million in federal money to help
needy families buy home heating oil in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also said he would seek $600 million in emergency funds to
deal with the current crisis and problems likely to occur later this year in
areas suffering from extreme heat. Clinton said he is restricted by law from
tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to moderate fuel prices, but added,
``I have not ruled out any action.''
</P>
<P>
	   The idea of a death penalty moratorium has gathered momentum since Gov. Ryan
took the unprecedented step Jan. 31 of putting all executions on hold in
Illinois, saying that the state's system was ``fraught with error.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before that, the American Bar Association had called for a death penalty
moratorium. Last week, Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., urged Clinton to suspend
federal executions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the federal cases, I don't believe it is called for,'' the president
said. He said 27 people face the death penalty under federal law, 20 in civilian
courts and seven through the military system. They are only a faction of the
nearly 3,600 people on death row nationwide. Texas leads with 463 sentenced to
death. Since 1973, 85 death row inmates have been freed, according to the
Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the Justice Department is reviewing whether the death penalty
is being imposed fairly from a racial standpoint, and is drawing up guidelines
to make it easier for prisoners to pursue clemency requests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that if I were a governor still, I would look very closely at the
situation in my state and decide what the facts are,'' said Clinton. As
governor, he signed four execution authorizations.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also said he was inclined to support a measure by Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., on capital punishment. It provides for DNA testing of inmates who
seek to prove they did not commit the crime for which they were condemned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Would I sleep better at night if it were law?'' Clinton said. ``If it
would really work, I would. In other words, I am favorably disposed toward it.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said that Ryan ``did the right thing'' in ordering a state moratorium on
executions, particularly since ``a majority of the American people support
capital punishment, as do I.''
</P>
<P>
	   On other subjects, Clinton:
</P>
<P>
	   --Said Republican presidential hopefuls John McCain and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas have ``got a tough job'' in running against the Clinton record of peace
and prosperity. ``I have a lot of sympathy with them,'' he said, a day after
sharp criticism from Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   --Said that Democratic rivals Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore were
``right to condemn'' Clinton's nomination of Republican Bradley Smith to the
Federal Election Commission. Clinton said that Smith ``hates campaign finance''
legislation but that he nominated him anyway simply to fill a Republican
vacancy, and Smith was the candidate favored by Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   --Refused to cast blame for the deepening crisis in the Northern Ireland
peace process. ``I don't think you can Monday morning quarterback that,'' the
president said. He said that the current crisis was ``a very unfortunate
development'' but that the IRA ``has given no indication whatever that they will
revert to violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And so that means that they still think, no matter what the rhetoric says,
that all the parties really believe that they ought to find a way to work this
out.''

<HEADLINE> Testimony abruptly ends in federal trial of accused drug lords  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Testimony abruptly ended Wednesday in the drug
conspiracy trial of two reputed kingpins accused of running the biggest cocaine
cartel in Camden's history.
<P>
	   The defense, which had subpoenaed at least a dozen city police officers,
rested its case without calling them. Five officers nervously paced in the
hallway for several hours before the defense decision was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Joseph H. Rodriguez rejected a defense motion
Wednesday to dismiss charges against Jose "J.R." Rivera and Luis "Tun" Figueroa.
</P>
<P>
	   The case will proceed to a jury to decide after hearing closing arguments
scheduled for Feb. 24. The jury began hearing testimony last month in what has
been described as one of the biggest drug prosecutions in Camden's history.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera and Figueroa are accused of conspiring to distribute hundreds of tons
of cocaine in Camden. Rivera is also accused of laundering drug profits through
his businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   They are the only two among 15 defendants charged in the case to stand
trial. If convicted, both face life in prison. The others pleaded guilty to drug
charges and many testified against them.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense argued Wednesday that prosecutors failed to make their case to
establish probable cause beyond a reasonable doubt and asked the judge to acquit
both defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge, however, agreed with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   "My view of the record is that there's more than sufficient evidence, if
considered in the light most favorable to the government, that the elements of
the offenses have been established," Rodriguez ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sidebar conference with the judge, the attorneys and prosecutors,
Rivera and Figueroa said they had decided against testifying, according to court
transcripts. Both defendants told the judge they understood their rights.
</P>
<P>
	   With that, both defense lawyers rested their cases. Assistant U.S. Attorney
Kevin Smith said prosecutors had no rebuttal witness to call. Rodriguez then
sent the jury home until next week.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a dramatic end to the trial, in its seventh week, where riveting
testimony by admitted drug dealers has implicated political figures and police
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Five convicted drug dealers have testified that Mayor Milton Milan - before
becoming the city's mayor in 1997 - sold drugs and bought bulk quantities of
cocaine from the ring.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan is not charged in the case and has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera's attorney, Marc Neff, had left open the possibility that the defense
would call at least one Camden police officer to testify Wednesday. It was not
revealed what the testimony would have included.
</P>
<P>
	   Neff, however, said he met with the witness, whom he did not identify, for
several hours Tuesday and decided not to call any additional witnesses on behalf
of Rivera. He gave no reason for the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, prosecutors turned over a box of documents to the defense, and
the judge recessed the trial to give the defense time to review the materials
before calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The documents were believed to be evidence that could have been used to
impeach the credibility of testimony by some of the police officers. Among those
subpoenaed was a 13-year veteran captured on tape advising Rivera on how to
handle narcotics investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   During the federal trial, drug dealers have named current and former city
police officers who they said tipped them off to raids or shook them down for
bribes.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have said the multimillion dollar drug ring flourished in Camden
for nearly a decade, in part, because of its close ties to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization primarily supplied drugs for two open-air drug markets in
the city, authorities said. It has been described as the most entrenched drug
cartel in Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera, 40, of Cherry Hill, who owns a gym and an auto parts store, is the
accused financier of the drug organization. Figueroa, 34, of Camden, prosecutors
allege, was its enforcer.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the drug ring used threats, violence and even murder to
control a lucrative drug market. The organization was eventually toppled in
February 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   During the trial, jurors heard graphic testimony about the 1993 slaying of a
rival drug dealer who was shot because he planned to set up his own drug set.
Figueroa, identified by prosecutors as the triggerman, faces trial in state
court on a murder charge in that case.

<HEADLINE> Fire Violations Found at Seton Hall  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFFREY GOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- The state took over fire inspections at Seton
Hall University this month and has since found a number of fire code violations,
including in the freshman dormitory where three students were killed in a
January blaze, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Violations at Boland Hall included unauthorized use of Christmas lights and
extension cords and excessive trash in dorm rooms, said Bill Cane, director of
the state Division of Fire Safety. He said there were some more serious
violations, but would not specify what they were.
</P>
<P>
	   University officials released a statement saying all of its six residence
halls ``meet building codes and all are safe.''
</P>
<P>
	   The state stripped the South Orange Fire Department of its annual fire
inspection duties at Seton Hall on Feb. 3 -- after Cane's inspectors found
violations and after he said he was unable to get access to complete inspection
records.
</P>
<P>
	   Cane said his examination of South Orange documents did not find any records
of annual fire inspections from 1995 on. South Orange is required by law to
inspect the campus for fire violations once a year.
</P>
<P>
	   But records released by South Orange on Wednesday and reviewed by The
Associated Press showed annual campus inspections from 1989 through 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Township officials said South Orange last inspected the campus for fire
violations on Oct. 22, 1998, but did not file a report because no violations
were found.
</P>
<P>
	   Township attorney Edwin Matthews said all violations detected on campus were
corrected within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall has been criticized for its fire safety plans since the Jan. 19
blaze in a third-floor lounge killed three freshmen and injured 62 other people.
Four students remain hospitalized for treatment of burns. The cause of the fire
is under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Villagers skeptical of safety claim after steam release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) - The steam was barely radioactive, its escape from
the Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor "momentary and minuscule," officials said.
There was no health danger, no need to warn nearby residents, no reason to keep
the kids home from school.
<P>
	   But some people living in the shadow of Indian Point said Wednesday that
they should have been let in on Tuesday night's accident, the most serious in
the 26-year history of the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   "Where were the sirens?" asked David Coviello, 55, who lives two doors from
the plant gate. "I have a 7-year-old son, an 18-year-old daughter."
</P>
<P>
	   Salvatore Simone said officials should notify residents of any accident,
regardless of its seriousness. "I should decide for myself," he said. "I might
have gotten into the car with my family and gotten away."
</P>
<P>
	   The sirens kept still because officials in four counties agreed that there
was no reason to set them off, said Westchester's deputy county executive, Jay
Hashmall, stepping in for County Executive Andrew Spano. Spano went to Los
Angeles Wednesday morning, coincidentally to examine that city's emergency
operations center.
</P>
<P>
	   Guidelines from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission "call for the sounding of
sirens only when some protective action is needed," such as evacuations or
stay-inside orders, Hashmall said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said no such measures were needed because the radioactivity
released was "completely unmeasurable," said Con Ed Vice President Steve Quinn.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Con Ed declared an alert, a first for the plant, which is on
the Hudson River about 35 miles north of Times Square and has 15.5 million
people within a 50-mile radius. An alert is one of four categories of nuclear
events identified by the NRC. In order from least serious to most serious they
are: unusual event, alert, site area emergency and general emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   The only general emergency at a U.S. nuclear plant was the March 1979
accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Mindy Landau of the NRC said there are an average of three or four alerts a
year among the nation's 103 operating reactors.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday night's alert was lifted at 6:50 p.m. Wednesday when water
temperatures cooled to below 200 degrees. Workers would then begin looking for
what caused the leak and determining how long the plant would be idle.
</P>
<P>
	   Quinn said the accident was caused by a leak in a tube carrying hot,
slightly radioactive water through a a pool of cooler water, which is thereby
turned into steam. The steam is used to turn a turbine, which generates
electricity. The plant produces about a seventh of the power Con Ed supplies to
its 3 million customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the hot water was under high pressure, it turned into steam as it
escaped from the tube at about 7:30 p.m. It was vented through the building's
roof, but a radiation detector in the vent sounded an alarm and automatically
closed the vent, so the slightly radioactive steam escaped into the air for only
a few seconds, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Radiation measurements taken around the plant found nothing above normal
background radiation, Quinn said, and workers were not exposed to anything above
what they get in a normal workday. No one was injured, he said, and "There is no
danger to the health and welfare of the general public."
</P>
<P>
	   Some villagers in Buchanan took that with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm definitely afraid," said Regina Ervin, just four doors from the plant
entrance. "I'm afraid to brush my teeth. I'm afraid to make the coffee."
</P>
<P>
	   Others, however, said they have learned to live with the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   David Allen, a magazine writer from Buchanan, said, "I guess I trust that
they'll tell us if there's a problem." George Kiljarian of Ossining, a retired
attorney, said, "I'm a fatalist. I made it through World War II. ... If they've
never had a problem in 26 years I guess that's all right."
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Jacobs, executive director of the Westchester People's Action
Coalition, said the Indian Point plants are old and failing and should be
investigated independent of the NRC.
</P>
<P>
	   NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan said steel-alloy tubes like the one that leaked
"have been known to develop leaks from time to time." Con Ed's Robert Leonard
said the tubes at Indian Point 2 were the originals from 1974. In the past, when
leaks were found, a tube might simply be plugged and not used because the
generator does not need all of the 200 tubes it has, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The nearby Indian Point 3 reactor, owned by the state Power Authority, has
been tentatively purchased for $806 million by Entergy Corp. of New Orleans,
which said Monday that it was also interested in buying Indian Point 2. Entergy
spokesman Carl Crawford said Wednesday that Tuesday's leak had no effect on
either deal.

<HEADLINE> Lesser Charges Urged in Diallo Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Apparently hedging their bets, prosecutors on Wednesday
asked that the jury be allowed to consider lesser charges in the murder trial of
four white police officers who killed an unarmed African immigrant in a barrage
of 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   The request came after two days of sometimes tearful testimony from the four
New York City officers, who said they shouted to Amadou Diallo and thought they
saw him pull a gun. The object turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutors asked Justice Joseph Teresi to direct the jury to consider
manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in addition to murder and other
charges. Teresi did not immediately make a decision.
</P>
<P>
	   He adjourned the trial until Tuesday, when the jury will hear closing
arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   The four New York City officers -- Kenneth Boss, 28, Richard Murphy, 27,
Sean Carroll, 37, and Edward McMellon, 27 -- gunned down Diallo a year ago in
the vestibule of his apartment building in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   They already pleaded innocent to charges of second-degree murder, depraved
indifference murder and reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted of second-degree murder, the officers face a maximum of 25
years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the prosecution request, the alternatives to the intentional murder
charge would be first-degree manslaughter -- intent to cause injury resulting in
death -- which carries a maximum sentence of 12 1/2 to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
	   For depraved indifference, options would be second-degree manslaughter --
recklessly causing death -- which carries a maximum sentence of 5 to 15 years;
or criminally negligent homicide -- failing to perceive the risk of death --
which carries a maximum of 1 1/3 to 4 years.
</P>
<P>
	   A conviction on the murder charge or the first-degree manslaughter charge
would guarantee some jail time for the officers. The lesser charges could allow
for probation.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Worth, McMellon's attorney, said the defense had no objection to the
jury considering lesser charges. But he added: ``We don't concede for a moment
that it's anything but not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors refused to say why they sought to include the lesser charges.
But both sides appeared to be hedging their bets -- the prosecution against
complete exoneration of defendants in a high-profile case; the defense against
harsh prison terms for their clients in the event of conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense rested Wednesday after its final witness, a police tactics
expert who consulted in the Rodney King case, testified that the officers were
right to charge the vestibule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was not only appropriate, it was really the job'' of the defendants to
pursue any suspicious person who ignores orders to halt, said James Fyfe, a
Temple University criminologist.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he is in fact a bad guy, things can only get worse once he's inside,''
Fyfe said. ``You want to keep him away from innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution contends that the officers never yelled a warning before
firing and that they continued shooting even as Diallo was going down. He was
hit by 19 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial was moved to Albany from New York because of pretrial publicity
and protests alleging widespread police abuse of minorities.

<HEADLINE> Low-Power FM Station Rule Attacked  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's broadcasting lobby asked an appeals court
Wednesday to set aside a rule adopted by federal regulators to create hundreds
of new low-power FM stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The petition filed in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia claims that the decision last month by the Federal Communications
Commission to authorize the stations is ``arbitrary, capricious and otherwise
contrary to law.''
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the National Association of Broadcasters, which made the appeal,
said the FCC's plan would cause significant interference to existing FM
stations. Broadcasters have opposed the idea since its inception, saying their
testing showed serious harm to the sound of existing stations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The FCC has violated its most sacred trust to the American consumer,''
said NAB president Edward O. Fritts. ``The plan to cram in hundreds, if not
thousands, of low-power FM stations will create unacceptable interference across
the radio dial.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the FCC said its own tests demonstrate that low-power service can be
introduced without harm to FM radio. Last month, it adopted rules so that it
could begin by summer awarding noncommercial, educational licenses to groups
that want to operate 100-watt and 10-watt stations. That's far less than the
6,000 watts to 100,000 watts at which most FM stations now operate.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan would give broadcasters between 4 miles and 7 miles of coverage
area. In the nation's largest radio markets -- New York, Chicago and Los Angeles
-- there will be no room for 100-watt stations. Cities like Washington could
accommodate three 100-watt stations, while Miami has room for four.
</P>
<P>
	   But the FCC also faces opposition in Congress. Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who
chairs the House Commerce Committee's panel on telecommunications, said Monday
that the existence of such stations might also undermine the need for funding
national public radio. He plans to hold his own hearings on the issue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're convinced the FCC moved forward without thinking this through
properly,'' Tauzin spokesman Ken Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Peru Soldiers Disperse Protesters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Heavily armed soldiers and police used tear gas Wednesday
to disperse about 1,000 students, teachers and construction workers who tried to
enter the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators waved flags, beat drums and set small fires during
repeated attempts to breach the palace gates to protest plans by President
Alberto Fujimori's candidacy for a third five-year term in power.
</P>
<P>
	   Armored cars blocked the side streets to prevent the demonstrators from
circling around the palace, which was marred by graffiti depicting a rat's body
with Fujimori's name scrawled across the belly.
</P>
<P>
	   As night fell, the protesters' numbers dwindled, but those remaining tore up
pieces of pavement in the tree-lined main plaza and hurled asphalt and rocks at
authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Fujimori, who first took office in 1990 and won re-election five years
later, is making an unprecedented third-term bid in the April 9 general
election.
</P>
<P>
	   The Congress, dominated by Fujimori supporters, circumvented a
constitutional ban on a third straight term in 1996 with a controversial law
that purportedly ``interpreted'' Peru's 1993 constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   The law said Fujimori's first election did not count toward the maximum of
two consecutive terms permitted because his 1990 victory predated the new
constitution's enactment.
</P>
<P>
	   Peru's National Coordinator for Human Rights said Wednesday that Fujimori is
exploiting poor peoples' dreams for a home to win votes.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 50,000 people have rushed to sign up for a chance to own
government-subsidized lots that Fujimori offered to any Peruvian who could not
otherwise afford land.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The impossible offer to donate state-owned property to all who need it is
one more open use of government resources to increase the popularity of one
candidate,'' the group, a coalition of 50 human rights organizations, said in a
communique.
</P>
<P>
	   The group warned of violent social upheavals if the government failed to
make good on its promise.
</P>
<P>
	   Fujimori has said the program is part of a housing program and denied it was
part of his campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
	   The land offer came days after Fujimori promised he would not inaugurate new
public works projects prior to the April 9 vote in response to international
elections observers who said he was abusing government-funded programs to
increase his popularity with voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly half of Peru's 25 million people live in poverty, according to the
United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Charter Announces Chapter 11 Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ALPHARETTA, Ga., (AP) -- Charter Behavioral Health Systems has filed for
Chapter 11 reorganization and intends to sell its core business in the Delaware
Bankruptcy Court, company officials announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Charter, the largest private provider of behavioral health services
nationwide, said the filing would not affect operations or the payment of
salaries, wages and benefits for employees at its core facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Charter, which recently announced the closure of 33 of its facilities, said
the move is necessary to ensure profitability.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's action is a critical step in allowing our core business to continue
to develop and provide innovative programs and services and lead the industry in
meeting the changing needs in behavioral health care," said Mike French,
president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   COPI Healthcare, a wholly owned subsidiary of Crescent Operating Inc. has
entered into an agreement with Charter to purchase the core business.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale is subject to court approval.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the restructuring announced last month, Charter closed or
consolidated 33 behavioral health facilities throughout the country in addition
to a corporate office reduction in overhead and staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Charter will continue to operate its remaining 37 facilities and said there
will be no disruption of care for the more than 2,000 inpatients and thousands
of outpatients currently under Charter's care.

<HEADLINE> Auto crises expose the myth that party members circle the wagons  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - One of the supposed benefits of being in a
political party, like any group of like-minded individuals, is that you should
be able to count on your allies for mutual support.
<P>
	   At a time of crisis over car inspections and now, perhaps, over the E-ZPass
toll system, Gov. Christie Whitman ought to be able to get help circling the
wagons. Or so one would think.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican leaders of the Senate and Assembly have not been so quick
with the "allies" bit. Some might say rather than helping with the wagons, they
seem ready to shoot the horses.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican political analyst Steve Salmore said alliance among GOP
politicians might be something outsiders perceive, but it is a myth. "Party is
really not as important today as personal career," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Salmore's observation carries double weight in light of the fact that Senate
President Donald DiFrancesco and Assembly Speaker Jack Collins both want to be
the next Republican governor when Whitman's term ends in two years.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is getting to the point where it is harder and harder to rally the
troops," Salmore said, recalling Whitman's demands for loyalty during a
pension-bond vote and the struggle to get her attorney general onto the state
Supreme Court. "They are tired of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   If Whitman ever needed allies, now would seem the time.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey residents may have an on-again off-again hostility toward taxes,
but there is nothing cyclical about how much they love and need their cars. And
the auto-dependent masses have plenty of cause for anxiety in how Whitman is
running the state.
</P>
<P>
	   First came the surreal collapse of the auto inspections system, which has
evolved from an embarrassment of glitches to a scandal with growing political
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Second comes the disclosure that Able Telecom has an audit report due any
day at its headquarters in Atlanta saying the firm's cash and credit have dried
up. This is as the firm is supposed to be installing the E-ZPass electronic toll
system.
</P>
<P>
	   Underlying it all is the perennial danger that the much-ballyhooed auto
insurance reform may turn out to be ballyhoo.
</P>
<P>
	   E-ZPass is already far behind schedule, and Able Telecom - which did not bid
for the New Jersey work but acquired it by corporate takeover - may collapse,
triggering another embarrassment for Whitman in her zeal to get private
enterprise into the public's business.
</P>
<P>
	   Delay in E-ZPass, though disappointing, would be nothing compared to a new
electronic toll system that fails with the magnitude of the emissions test.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, one fear seen in a practice run is that unscrupulous drivers
will zip through the electronic lane without payment or penalty while
law-abiding drivers receive erroneous fines in the mail.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Jersey car lifestyle includes driving to the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins and DiFrancesco denounce claims that these issues have triggered
division.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins said the Assembly does not intend to conduct an investigation of car
inspections as the Senate will. But in the same conversation, he said problems
with Able Telecom may warrant legislative scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hey, I am going to find out what is going on. I want to be on top of this,"
Collins said. As the Senate aims a task force at the auto inspections scandal,
"maybe the Assembly will be the E-ZPass investigators," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco said it is necessary for a lawmaker to be active in scrutinizing
that which upsets his constituents.
</P>
<P>
	   "Two big contracts seem to be faltering for different reasons," DiFrancesco
said. "I am part of the team here, and I get as much blame as everyone else when
things don't go right."
</P>
<P>
	   If Whitman has not gotten as much backing as some might expect, Collins and
DiFrancesco said one reason could be the reluctance by her staff to share
information.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not getting the kind of briefings that perhaps we had hoped, and
quite frankly now the horse is out of the barn, and we need to be involved in
trying to resolve this," DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins said the Whitman administration frequently handles issues quietly
since legislators have a tough time keeping secrets. For him, though, this
attitude begs the question: Why are there secrets?
</P>
<P>
	   "There is about government, and what people think government should be
doing," Collins said, "and then there is politics."

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Victims Identified  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW FORDAHL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The remains of two more victims of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 were identified Wednesday as the medical examiner's office worked on
providing death certificates to the families of all 88 people killed in the
crash.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of 49 victims' remains have been identified since the Jan. 31 crash
off Southern California, said Barbara Brodfuehrer, spokeswoman for the Ventura
County medical examiner. No remains have been recovered since Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   California law does not allow death certificates to be issued unless remains
are recovered and identified. The certificates are required before next of kin
can access banking accounts, collect insurance, transfer property or execute
wills.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors voted to authorize a
court petition on behalf of the families of the victims. If the petition is
accepted, a judge will issue death certificates even for crash victims whose
remains have not been recovered or identified.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation into the cause of the crash is focused on the component
that moves the horizontal stabilizer, a tail-mounted wing that controls the
plane's up-and-down movement.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots reported trouble with the device before the jetliner nose-dived into
the Pacific, and pieces pulled from the wreckage indicated unusual wear on a nut
that anchors the jackscrew, which moves the stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators have not determined whether the damage contributed to the
crash or was caused by the impact.

<HEADLINE> Latvia Wants Nazi Suspect Released  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN C. JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Latvia asked Australia on Wednesday to agree quickly to
an extradition treaty that would open the way for 86-year-old war crimes suspect
Konrads Kalejs to be returned to his native country if he is indicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Concluding the treaty ``is a maximum priority for us,'' foreign ministry
spokesman Janis Silis said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators from the United States, Canada, Australia, Great Britain,
Germany and Israel gathered in the Latvian capital to compare notes on Kalejs in
a two-day meeting, scheduled to end Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs is accused of involvement in Nazi atrocities during Germany's 1941-44
occupation of the Baltic country.
</P>
<P>
	   Jewish groups have pressured Latvia to extradite Kalejs for trial, after he
was found by Nazi hunters to be living in a retirement home in Britain. Kalejs,
who was deported from the United States and Canada in the 1990s for lying about
his wartime record, fled in January to Australia, where he has had citizenship
since 1957.
</P>
<P>
	   At the meeting Wednesday, Latvian officials handed a note to Australia's
ambassador to Latvia, Stephen Brady, asking Australia to help overcome
``bureaucratic delays'' on both sides that were hampering an agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Concluding a treaty in four to six weeks is a possible time frame,'' Silis
said. ``But there is still work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from Australian officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Latvian and Australian prosecutors have said they were willing to indict
Kalejs, but that they did not have enough witnesses or evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Jewish groups say Kalejs was involved in World War II massacres as a
lieutenant in the Arajs Kommando, a notorious Nazi-sponsored death squad staffed
mainly by Latvians. The unit is said to have murdered some 30,000 Latvian Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs has said he was ordered by German officers to head an Arajs Kommando
unit, but denied he was present when civilians were shot.
</P>
<P>
	   In total, 80,000 Jews perished during the Nazi occupation, most within the
first year of German rule. Germans planned and ordered the massacres, but
Latvian Nazis often carried them out.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which tracks people accused of
atrocities against Jews, provided Latvian officials with the names of seven
former Arajs men who could testify against Kalejs. Zuroff said testimony from
these men would be key in indicting Kalejs.

<HEADLINE> Germany Bans Biotech Corn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Health Minister Andrea Fischer ordered a ban Wednesday on
cultivation of genetically modified corn in Germany, saying the plants contain a
substance that could affect the effectiveness of antibiotics in humans.
</P>
<P>
	   Novartis, a Swiss-based drugs and biotechnology company, received permission
three years ago to plant the altered corn on test fields in Germany, and had
applied for permission to sell it to farmers for general use.
</P>
<P>
	   But some government experts had raised doubts about the safety of the crop,
arguing that the insecticide it produces through genetic modification could have
unintended environmental consequences.
</P>
<P>
	   Health experts also raised doubts about the altered corn because it was made
resistant to the antibiotic Ampicillin to differentiate it from normal corn.
Some fear that could reduce the effectiveness of the drug on humans.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischer said the decision to ban cultivation for now was reached in
consultation with the Environment and Agriculture ministries, and would remain
in effect until the European Union reaches a final decision on the use of
genetically modified crops.

<HEADLINE> Gore Inspects Tornado Damage  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- Al Gore took a taxpayer-funded helicopter detour to
inspect Georgia tornado damage on Wednesday, blurring lines between his vice
presidential duties and the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Democratic rival Bill Bradley suggested the administration was
using cold-weather aid in the Northeast to boost Gore in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   With candidates' remaining money becoming more of a factor, the vice
president's politically beneficial government duties are expected to increase.
On Friday, his Black History Month appeal to black voters takes the form of an
official address to the Africa Summit in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   He's not shy about pointing out the two roles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I leave here, I'm going to be leaving as vice president ... but while
I'm here I want to ask for your help in my campaign,'' Gore told 150 supporters
Wednesday outside Air Force Two during a pit stop in Macon.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokeswoman Laura Quinn said local officials, knowing Gore had planned a
campaign town-hall forum in Macon, asked him instead to tour the tornado
disaster. ``A very small fraction'' of the cost of the day's activities was
being shifted to the government, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has about $18 million -- to Bradley's $20 million -- in campaign funds
at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Following Bradley's lead on another subject Wednesday, the vice president
belatedly condemned President Clinton's nomination of Bradley Smith, a
Republican who opposes the overhaul of the campaign finance system, to the board
of the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The last thing we need is an FEC commissioner who publicly questions not
only the constitutionality of proposed reform but also the constitutionality of
current limitations,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans had been insisting on the nomination for months -- it's
traditional that each party gets to choose half the commission -- and Clinton
reluctantly made it official this week.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Bradley criticized Gore for not protesting to Clinton before
the appointment. ``I did not know that the nomination was pending,'' Gore said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He said being unaware of the situation wasn't unusual since ``I'm out on the
road full-time now.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's final shot: ``I said it last week and he said it this week. That's
par for the course. I take a position and a week later, he takes the same
position.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Buffalo and Rochester, Bradley accused Gore of ignoring places like
western New York in his courtship of other states.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also suggested the administration had based its release of
cold-weather relief money on the primary schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to 150 supporters and onlookers at Erie Community College in
Buffalo, Bradley said, ``You can't come to western New York after being in power
seven years and say you're going to have a program to help those parts of the
country that haven't moved ahead. The question is, where were you for the last
seven years?''
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign released a document alleging New Yorkers were ``left out in the
cold'' when the government released emergency heating assistance through the Low
Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>
	   The document shows New Hampshire residents got an infusion of aid Jan. 26, a
week before the state's primary, while New York, which holds its primary March
7, got its largest chunk of money Feb. 10. New York also got less money per
household.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The timing is interesting,'' Bradley said. ``I realize I'm running against
entrenched power,'' and part of entrenched power is helping a favored candidate,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign's response was quick and short.
</P>
<P>
	   ``News flash to Senator Bradley: It's cold and people need help. It's cold
in New Hampshire and it's cold in New York.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Bradley was releasing a new television ad on abortion -- his
second on the issue. The two Democratic rivals agree on abortion now, but
Bradley has been hammering Gore on his early record, including opposition to
Medicaid funding for abortion. The spot comes two days after Gore's endorsement
by a leading abortion rights group.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also released a new ad, a remake of a New Hampshire spot, depicting him
as a fighter who took on polluters, would-be Medicare cutters and insurance
companies opposed to a ``patients bill of rights.'' It says Gore is committed to
``preserving Medicaid'' -- a gentle reminder of his attacks on Bradley's plan to
replace Medicaid with a new program.
</P>
<P>
	   In Georgia, Gore helicoptered over the four counties hit by twisters this
week, landing in Camilla and walking through an all-but-obliterated area that
emergency officials called ``ground zero'' in an area that accounted for 13 of
the state's total 18 fatalities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What do you guys make of all this? Pretty scary, wasn't it?'' he said to
one family. ``Call me if there's anything I can do,'' he said, giving them the
toll-free number for federal aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's day, from his sleepover and breakfast at the North Carolina
Governor's Mansion to his flight aboard a military helicopter to tour the
tornado damage, showed the advantages of incumbency.
</P>
<P>
	   He later flew to New Orleans for an address AFL-CIO leaders Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Israel Mayor Chides Vatican-PLO Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By DAFNA LINZER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- An upcoming visit to the Holy Land by Pope John Paul II has
been marred by an agreement between the Vatican and the Palestinians,
Jerusalem's mayor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is morally reprehensible that in the context of a very exciting visit,
which was to be a historic landmark in relations between the Church and the
Jewish people, political situations are introduced that are threatening to spoil
the joy, the excitement and the historical symbolism of the visit,'' Ehud Olmert
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican-PLO agreement covered the status of churches and the freedom of
worship in the Palestinian territories. The preamble declared that an
``equitable solution'' for Jerusalem, based on international resolutions, is
``fundamental for a just and lasting peace.'' It called for international
safeguards of freedom of religion.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and
annexed it into its capital. The Palestinians hope to establish the capital of a
future state there. The city's fate is to be decided in a final peace accord
between the sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Without mentioning Israel by name, the agreement said that ``unilateral
decisions and actions altering the specific character and status of Jerusalem
are morally and legally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many Israelis had hoped the visit of the 79-year-old pontiff would improve
ties with the Vatican which has been criticized for doing little to save Jews
from the Nazi Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
	   Olmert said in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday that he
would be ``polite and hospitable'' to the pope, ``but there certainly will be a
bitter taste and this is very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli government strongly protested the agreement, signed Tuesday, and
summoned the pope's envoy on Wednesday for clarifications.
</P>
<P>
	   Eitan Bentsur, director of the Israeli foreign ministry, called the timing
of the agreement ``deplorable.''
</P>
<P>
	   The political preamble to the agreement, ``and specifically the clause that
deals with Jerusalem, are unacceptable,'' Bentsur said after meeting with the
envoy, Archbishop Pietro Sambi.
</P>
<P>
	   Sambi brushed aside the Israeli criticism, saying the agreement with the
Palestinians was not political.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no reference to the political situation of Jerusalem,'' Sambi
said after the meeting with Bentsur.
</P>
<P>
	   Olmert accused the Vatican of playing into the hands of the Palestinians by
taking positions which do not reflect the situation on the ground. Israel, he
said, had demonstrated a commitment to protecting Christian holy places over 33
years of control in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Okla. Teachers Rally for Better Pay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- About 17,000 teachers rallied Thursday at the state
Capitol for higher pay and more funding for education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's been 10 years since we've had an investment in education. You can't
wait 10 years. You have to have it each and every year,'' Carolyn Crowder,
president of the Oklahoma Education Association, told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   As the teachers rallied, state House members voted 98-1 for a $3,000-a-year
pay raise. It passed the Senate 47-0, and Gov. Frank Keating has said he will
sign the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside, science teacher Kim Roberts passed out cattle backbones adorned
with a tag that said, ``Increase Common Education Funding -- Have a Backbone.''
Shelby Baughn, a preschooler attending the rally with her family, held up a
homemade sign that said, ``Oklahoma's Report Card: Prison Funding A+, Education
Funding F.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Keating joked that the best way to deal with the state
teachers union is ``homicide.'' He later apologized for the remark.

<HEADLINE> Haider Denied Holocaust Center Trip  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Austrian right-wing political figure Joerg Haider, on an
unannounced private visit to Canada, was prohibited from touring Montreal's
Holocaust Center on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Moshe Ronen, president of the Canadian Jewish Congress, said Canada's Jewish
community was concerned about Haider's unannounced visit and questioned Haider's
motives in asking to tour the Holocaust center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our advice to the museum was not to accommodate this bizarre request,''
Ronen said. ``They did not accommodate the visit.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's itinerary was unknown. He ignored journalists gathered at the
Ritz-Carlton Hotel, where he was staying, saying: ``It's a private visit. I
didn't invite you here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Canada has downgraded relations with Austria over the inclusion of Haider's
Freedom Party in the government. Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said
Wednesday that Canada received no advance notice that Haider would be arriving
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Certainly there was no indication from the Austrian government or embassy
that he would be coming,'' Axworthy said. ``It is unusual but there is no visa
requirement for Austrian citizens so anybody can get on a plane and arrive in
Canada and if they have a proper passport they are given entry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since Haider's Freedom Party became part of Austria's coalition government
on Feb. 4, several countries have protested. Israel withdrew its ambassador from
Vienna, and Israeli Interior Minister Natan Sharansky has banned the populist
leader from entering the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has praised Adolf Hitler's ``orderly'' economic policies and has
described SS veterans as honorable. He has since apologized for remarks that
specifically offended Jews, but many say that his anti-immigrant rhetoric
deliberately echoes Austria's fascist past.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Haider would never
persuade the world that his views were not racist.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech welcoming German President Johannes Rau to Israel's parliament,
Barak said Haider's attempts to calm Israel and the world about his intentions
did not deceive him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was not the slips of the tongue that shocked us,'' Barak said. ``It was
the opinions, the true, racist and antidemocratic opinions that Joerg Haider may
try to refrain from expressing openly from now on.''

<HEADLINE> Redwood Monument Plan Controversial  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Environmentalists offered praise and loggers
scorned President Clinton's suggestion to create a national monument for 400,000
acres of timber lands, including the giant sequoia redwoods.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton told Agriculture Secretary Daniel Glickman on Tuesday he is
considering new protections -- including the formation of a national monument --
for the vast old-growth groves in national forest lands outside the protected
Kings Canyon, Sequoia and Yosemite national parks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to ensure that those majestic cathedral groves ... are protected
for future generations to study and enjoy,'' Clinton wrote. He asked Glickman to
make recommendations within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Timber companies said Wednesday the existing protections are sufficient and
the president's proposal would only accelerate logging's decline.
</P>
<P>
	   The move would cut logging by two-thirds for Sierra Forest Products, company
general manager Kent Duysen said, and placing large amounts of acreage
off-limits would boost the fire danger, too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've really only got 16,000 acres of groves, and they want to make a land
grab of 400,000 acres under the guise of protecting the giant sequoias. It's all
going to burn. It's leaving science and people out of the process,'' Duysen
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists said the Forest Service's regulation of logging has been
lax. They said logging has been permitted up to the edge of national parks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Over half of the sequoias are not permanently protected,'' said Barbara
Boyle, regional director of the Sierra Club for California-Nevada-Hawaii.
``They're mostly those in the national forests that are adjacent to the national
parks. They need protections.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Forest Service's top timberland official in the area, Regional Forester
Art Gaffrey, said suggestions from residents and state, local and tribal
officials would be considered in the final proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Rep. George Radanovich, whose district has three national forests
and two national parks, criticized Clinton's move.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When a government can close off public lands on a whim without asking for
public comment, they aren't really public lands any more,'' Radanovich said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1906 Antiquities Act allows presidents, without congressional approval,
to safeguard objects of historic and scientific interest. President Theodore
Roosevelt used it to set aside the Grand Canyon in 1908 and President Carter
invoked it to establish large sections of Alaska wilderness in the 1970s.

<TEXT>
<P>
    TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Humana Health Plan has agreed to refund $800,000
to more than 2,000 elderly customers to settle allegations it enticed them to
join the HMO by using a deceptive hearing aid offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Louisville, Ky.-based Humana admitted no wrongdoing in settling with Florida
investigators, but also agreed to revise its marketing to avoid deceptive
practices, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth said.
</P>
<P>
	   Humana offered discounted hearing aids after six months to people who chose
to have their Medicare benefits administered through the company's Gold Plus
Plan.
</P>
<P>
	   But Butterworth alleged participants were charged more for the hearing aids
than they would have paid at a retail store, with the cost difference
effectively negating any discount.
</P>
<P>
	   Humana acknowledged to state officials that their pricing structure was
confusing and said it hoped the settlement would correct any misunderstandings.

<HEADLINE> Sears Pulls Benetton Contract  </HEADLINE>
    By TAMMY WEBBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck and Co. terminated its contract with the
trendy Benetton clothing company Wednesday under pressure from victims' rights
groups who objected to the Italian company's ad campaign featuring death row
inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   Sears chairman and chief executive Arthur C. Martinez was "outraged," as
were many customers, at ads showing photographs of the inmates, said company
spokesman Tom Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
	   The company ended its contract even after Benetton agreed to allow Sears to
preview future ads. Sears had previously said it would keep the contract under
that condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Sears has been weighing its decision to terminate the contract since it
learned the content of the ads in early January, "and it ultimately came to the
point we felt this decision had to be made," Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been hearing from people who have lost loved ones to some of the
folks who have been profiled," Nicholson said. "It's reopened wounds and brought
back a lot of painful memories and people are hurt by it. They feel the (inmates
are) glorified and the victims are ignored."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday groups picketed a Houston Sears store and Benetton's New York
office. Hours later, Sears announced it would immediately pull Benetton-designed
clothing from all 400 Sears stores that have been selling the Benetton USA line.
</P>
<P>
	   "The advertising campaign was inconsistent with what Sears has come to stand
for and is inconsistent with the customer base we serve," said Nicholson. "We
have a high level of customer trust and loyalty, and there has been some strong
emotional reaction to (Benetton's) campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   The ads, which began appearing in magazines and on billboards late last
month, feature portraits of American death row inmates in prison uniforms over
the words, "Sentenced to Death." The ads also give the inmate's name, date of
birth, crime and expected method of execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Benetton officials said the ads were meant to raise awareness about the
death penalty, but victims' rights groups said the ads glorified convicted
killers and were insensitive to victims' families and friends.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody has the right to their opinion, but the ad campaign is not a
social debate," said Dianne Clements, president of Justice for All, a
Houston-based victims' rights group. "If it were, there would be balance.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not about the death penalty, it's about Benetton products. Benetton
wants to spoon-feed the American consuming public their interpretation of social
awareness, (but) we will regurgitate it."
</P>
<P>
	   She said she has "an absolute, utmost respect for Sears and their decision."
</P>
<P>
	   Clements said Benetton was not a good association for Sears, which she said
is an "All-American store."
</P>
<P>
	   Benetton spokesman Mark Major did not immediately return a phone call
seeking comment on Sears' decision. But earlier Wednesday he said Benetton stood
by its ads and believed it had succeeded in "launching a national and global
discussion on capital punishment."
</P>
<P>
	   "This had nothing to do with apparel; nothing to do with the product," Major
said. "Benetton has historically approached social issues and we think it is
important ... to engage people to think about issues."
</P>
<P>
	   Benetton has made headlines in the past with ads addressing such topics as
AIDS and racism. It also prompted protests from the Roman Catholic Church in the
1990s for ads featuring models dressed as a priest and a nun that were kissing.
</P>
<P>
	   Sears, based in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, introduced the
clothing line, called Benetton USA, last fall to help boost lagging clothing
sales. Benetton made that line exclusively for Sears and continued to sell its
United Colors of Benetton clothing in its own stores.

<HEADLINE> Residents Angry After Nuke Release  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM FITZGERALD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) -- A generator leak at a Hudson River nuclear power
plant resulted in a brief release of radioactive steam, and some people living
in the plant's shadow said Wednesday that they should have been alerted to the
accident.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Where were the sirens?'' asked David Coviello, 55, who lives two doors
from the plant gate. ``I have a 7-year-old son, an 18-year-old daughter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the steam was barely radioactive, and its escape Tuesday
night from the Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor was ``momentary and minuscule,''
so there was no health danger and no need to warn nearby residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, resident Salvatore Simone said officials should notify people of any
accident, regardless of its seriousness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I should decide for myself,'' he said. ``I might have gotten into the car
with my family and gotten away.''
</P>
<P>
	   The sirens were kept silent because officials in four counties agreed that
there was no reason to set them off, said deputy county executive, Jay Hashmall.
</P>
<P>
	   Guidelines from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ``call for the sounding of
sirens only when some protective action is needed,'' such as evacuations or
stay-inside orders, Hashmall said.
</P>
<P>
	   Consolidated Edison Co., which owns and operates the plant, declared an
alert, a first for the plant, which is on the Hudson River about 35 miles north
of New York City. About 15.5 million people live within a 50-mile radius. An
alert is one of four categories of nuclear events identified by the NRC. In
order from least serious to most serious they are: unusual event, alert, site
area emergency and general emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   The only general emergency at a U.S. nuclear plant was the March 1979
accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Mindy Landau of the NRC said there are an average of three or four alerts a
year among the nation's 103 operating reactors.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday night's alert was lifted at 6:50 p.m. Wednesday when water
temperatures cooled to below 200 degrees. Workers were to begin looking for what
caused the leak and deciding how long the plant would be idle.
</P>
<P>
	   Con Ed Vice President Steve Quinn said the accident -- the most serious in
the 26-year history of the plant -- was caused by a leak in a tube carrying hot,
slightly radioactive water through a pool of cooler water, which is thereby
turned into steam. The steam is used to turn a turbine, which generates
electricity. The plant produces about a seventh of the power Con Ed supplies to
its 3 million customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the hot water was under high pressure, it turned into steam as it
escaped from the tube. It was vented through the building's roof, but a
radiation detector in the vent sounded an alarm and automatically closed the
vent, so the slightly radioactive steam escaped into the air for only a few
seconds, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Radiation measurements taken around the plant found nothing above normal
background radiation, Quinn said, adding: ``There is no danger to the health and
welfare of the general public.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some villagers in Buchanan took that with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm definitely afraid,'' said Regina Erben, just four doors from the plant
entrance. ``I'm afraid to brush my teeth. I'm afraid to make the coffee.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others, however, said they have learned to live with the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I guess I trust that they'll tell us if there's a problem,'' said David
Allen, a magazine writer.
</P>
<P>
	   Said George Kiljarian, a retired attorney: ``I'm a fatalist. I made it
through World War II. ... If they've never had a problem in 26 years I guess
that's all right.''

<HEADLINE> More Senior Housing Options Urged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- As the number of senior citizens soars, the
construction industry will have to come up with better home designs and
residential alternatives for the aging population, according to a Harvard
University report.
</P>
<P>
	   By 2030, the over-65 population is expected to nearly double to about 70
million, bringing their share of the American population to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   A two-year study released this week by Harvard's Joint Center for Housing
Studies examined the challenges facing the next generation of seniors.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Only about 10 percent of seniors live in age-restricted communities and
just a third of these live in settings that provide services.
</P>
<P>
	   -- About 10 percent of seniors move in with someone or have someone move in
with them for physical assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Only half of seniors with disabilities have the home modifications they
need.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fewer seniors will have large families from which to draw support, and
continuing income and wealth disparities among seniors will restrict the housing
choices of many seniors, especially as longevity increases,'' said Eric Belsky,
executive director of the Joint Center.
</P>
<P>
	   As the baby boomers age, seniors will become a major presence in housing
sales nationwide. Nine out of 10 people over age 70 live in conventional
housing. But those homes are not designed to meet the changing needs of seniors,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of thousands of senior citizens live without the handrails, grab
bars, ramps, elevators and stair lifts that would allow them to function better
at home, the report said.

    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen early Thursday in light
trading ahead of the release of U.S. economic data. Japanese stocks fell
moderately.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 109.38 yen, up 0.36 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but
marginally lower than its late New York level of 109.39 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 73.41 points, or 0.37

</P>
<P>
	   In foreign exchange, traders said early dealings were quiet and the dollar
was expected to move in a narrow range as investors adjust positions ahead of
the release of U.S. producer price index data later Thursday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached in Waco Investigation  </HEADLINE>
   By CONNIE FARROW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The government and lawyers for the Branch Davidians agreed
Wednesday on how to re-create conditions of the 1993 siege on the group, in
hopes of putting to rest questions about whether federal agents fired shots at
the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   The parties met for nearly five hours with a federal judge at the office of
Special Counsel John Danforth in downtown St. Louis and agreed to make the
details of the re-creation public.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides hope the test will determine what caused more than 100 flashes to
show up on the infrared tape the FBI shot of the siege at Waco, Texas, in 1993.
They plan to compare the FBI tape and aerial surveillance footage made at the
re-creation, tentatively scheduled to take place March 18 or 19 at Fort Hood,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear whether media will be allowed to attend. Branch Davidian
lawyers Michael Caddell and Jim Brannon, along with Texas U.S. Attorney Mike
Bradford, said they believed the media should be present. It appeared Danforth
objected.
</P>
<P>
	   Danforth and his chief of staff declined to comment after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to open the test rests with U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith
Jr. He is presiding over the wrongful death lawsuit filed by the Branch
Davidians against the government.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has insisted that no agents fired their weapons. But the
Branch Davidian plaintiffs, backed by infrared experts, contend that the bursts
of light on the FBI tape can be nothing other than gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the test is completed, it will still be subject to interpretation by
various parties,'' Bradford said. ``I think that's going to be inevitable as
part of the process.''
</P>
<P>
	   The protocol for the re-creation calls for aircraft operated by British
pilots and the FBI to fly overhead with infrared equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Personnel will be filmed in crouching, kneeling and in standing
positions,'' Caddell said. ``They will wear different types of body wear, such
as body suits and camouflage, to help determine whether the clothing somehow
keeps them from being visible'' to infrared cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   Caddell said a variety of weapons will be used. He also said the test will
spread debris -- such as glass, water and aluminum -- to determine whether that
could have caused the flashes picked up by the FBI's infrared cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   After the test, a company chosen by Danforth called Vector Data Systems will
verify whether the conditions of the test were satisfactorily met. Vector will
give the original tapes to the court, and the parties in the lawsuit will
proceed with their own analyses of the data.
</P>
<P>
	   Danforth was appointed last September by Attorney General Janet Reno to
resolve unanswered questions about the final hours of the deadly 51-day
standoff. Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died some in the
fire that engulfed the compound, others from gunshot wounds. The government
insists the Davidians perished by their own hands.

Soaring Gas Prices May Curtail East Coast Vacations
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- Travelers planning a trip to Atlantic
Canada could be in for a rude shock no matter what form of transportation they
choose.
</P>
<P>
	   Gas prices, which reached dizzying heights this week across Canada, remain
at the top of the scale in Newfoundland, with the rest of the East Coast not far
behind.
</P>
<P>
	   In St. John's, for example, the average price for a liter of regular gas
stood at 76.5 cents on Tuesday -- by far the highest price for any major
Canadian city.
</P>
<P>
	   Smaller Newfoundland communities led the way with Gander and Corner Brook
topping the price list at 78.9 and 77.9 respectively, according to MJ Ervin &AMP;
Associates of Calgary.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Newfoundland's Transportation Minister Rick Woodford warned of a
shortage of airline seats as Air Canada rejigs its routes following its merger
with Canadian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   Woodford said he has learned there would be nearly 10,000 fewer available
airline seats for flights to St. John's during the four summer months.
</P>
<P>
	   Air Canada Nicole Couture-Simard said the minister's numbers are wrong. The
airline has increased capacity to St. John's enough to cover all of the business
once handled by InterCanadian, a regional air carrier that shut down in
November.

Ontario Power Plants Play Role in Smog Talks
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Ontario's dirty coal-fired power plants are expected to
weaken Canada's negotiating position as Ottawa and Washington open their most
important air-quality talks since the acid rain treaty of 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal of the talks is to reduce transboundary smog -- scientifically
known as ground-level ozone -- which plagues Eastern Canada and the British
Columbia Lower Mainland.
</P>
<P>
	   Environment Minister David Anderson says he is committed to a strong treaty
by the end of the year, noting that smog kills an estimated 5,000 Canadians
annually.
</P>
<P>
	   The Environment Department says 35 to 90 per cent of the smog in Eastern
Canada comes from the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   But Anderson conceded that emissions in Ontario, where air pollution has
risen in recent years, may weaken Canada's position in the talks that began
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists say Ontario's six coal-fired plants pollute at a rate
about three times higher than allowed by New York State.

Lawyer: RCMP Overlooked Oil Patch Vandalism Suspects
</P>
<P>
	   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- An RCMP investigation into oil patch vandalism in
northwestern Alberta was attacked in court again Wednesday with suggestions that
officers were so focused on Wiebo Ludwig they overlooked other potential
suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyer Paul Moreau said there were at least six area men who were
concerned about the health effects of oil and gas development. Some of those men
had been investigated in other vandalism incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   One of those suspects was Robert Wraight, who later became a paid RCMP
informant in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Retired RCMP Sgt. Keith Hills, who led the investigation, said the other men
were not considered suspects because no evidence pointed toward them.
</P>
<P>
	   Ludwig and his friend Richard Boonstra face 18 charges related to oil patch
vandalism. Ludwig faces one additional count of extortion.

Collenette To Offer Consumer-Friendly Airline Legislation
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- The federal government has given two charter carriers
approval to fly scheduled service to the United Kingdom and Germany on the eve
of unveiling what's billed as consumer-friendly airline legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Collenette has refused to say much about the legislation, which is scheduled
to be tabled today in the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
	   But reports suggest airline passengers will be protected from price gouging
as Air Canada becomes the dominant national carrier with its takeover of
Canadian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   An airline watchdog will be established and the federal Competition Bureau
and the Canadian Transportation Agency will be given increased powers.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation will also force Air Canada's regional airlines to provide
service in French and English, according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
	   In a nod to consumers Wednesday, Collenette announced that charter carriers
Canada 3000 and Air Transat have been designated to deliver scheduled service to
some centers in the United Kingdom and Germany.

Chretien Berated Over Fountain Funding
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien played fast and loose with the
rules to ensure a $200,000 government grant to build an ornamental fountain in
his riding, the Reform party maintained Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Documents released under the Access to Information Act indicate a file on
the project was forwarded to bureaucrats in Ottawa in March 1998 by Denise
Tremblay, an aide in Chretien's riding office in Shawinigan, Quebec
</P>
<P>
	   At the time the project sponsor -- a historical society known as Heritage
Shawinigan -- had not yet filed an application form with the federal regional
development office for Quebec.
</P>
<P>
	   The application arrived May 4. The public servant in charge of the file
recommended it to his superiors on May 28 and the group was advised in July the
project had been approved.
</P>
<P>
	   Deborah Grey, the Reform deputy leader, blasted Chretien for letting his
riding office lobby for the project before the sponsors had contacted the
department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The prime minister broke the rules,'' Grey contended in the Commons.
</P>
<P>
	   Chretien shrugged off the attack, saying the fountain had been talked about
for years by the cities of Shawinigan and Shawinigan-Sud and there was nothing
unusual about offering his backing as the local MP.

Investors Dump Millons of Talisman Shares
</P>
<P>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Talisman Energy Inc. called for calm Wednesday
while investors dumped millions of its shares in response to U.S. sanctions on a
Sudanese oil development partly owned by the Calgary-based firm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There seems to be massive confusion,'' said Jackie Sheppard,
vice-president of Talisman's legal and corporate projects. ``I feel today's
announcement was misunderstood.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States Treasury Department announced American citizens and
companies can no longer conduct trade or have financial deals with Sudan's
Sudapet Ltd. or with Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration imposed the sanctions after ruling that the oil
operation is an entity of the Sudanese government, which is accused of using oil
revenues to help finance a civil war against rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Talisman, Canada's largest independent oil producer, owns one-quarter of the
Greater Nile development, which contains reserves of about 800 million barrels
of low-cost oil. Almost 2.7 million Talisman shares traded on the Toronto Stock
Exchange on Wednesday, ending a turbulent day down $2.20 a share, settling at
$38.90.

Tainted-Blood Victims Await Compensation Ruling
</P>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- Canada's hepatitis C victims could be one step closer to
knowing how much longer they'll have to wait to get their first cheques from a
$1.2-billion compensation deal.
</P>
<P>
	   A hearing in Quebec Superior Court was set to resume today to determine
whether Peterson Worldwide, the company appointed to manage the fund, should be
allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
	   The stability of the firm has been called into question amid reports its
parent company, Navigant, is facing several class-action suits in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Judges in British Columbia and Ontario have already approved Peterson
Worldwide, but the compensation plan for Canadians who contracted hepatitis C
through the tainted blood supply needs a Quebec court's stamp of approval before
the money will start flowing to victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike McCarthy, the society's national vice-president, said the society
endorses Peterson despite its legal trouble because many victims don't have time
to wait for another company to take over.
</P>
<P>
	   In Toronto earlier this week, Ottawa and the Ontario government went to
court to argue that some of the lawyers who helped win the compensation deal
don't deserve their $15-million fee.
</P>
<P>
	   Government lawyers argued the nine Ontario lawyers who spent years fighting
to reach a deal should be paid no more than $4.1 million.

RCMP Knows Suspected Hacker's Identity
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- The Mounties know the identity of an Internet user who may be
a suspect in a global investigation into last week's Internet hacking.
</P>
<P>
	   A Toronto-based Internet provider confirmed Wednesday it supplied the
identity of the user late Tuesday after the RCMP showed up with a search
warrant.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet Direct confirmed earlier this week it once had a client who went by
the Internet moniker ``mafiaboy'' -- the same nickname of a user suspected of
being an Internet vandal connected to last week's cyber-mayhem.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet Direct said it didn't know whether its former client was the
hacker, but said it would provide a name if presented with a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mounties would not confirm or deny the company's report,

<HEADLINE> Two Convicted in Decapitation Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   METZ, France (AP) -- A French court convicted two men on Wednesday in the
knifing murder of a woman, a crime that the defendants said was inspired by the
movie ``Seven'' and included a failed plan to mail the victim's severed head.
</P>
<P>
	   The court sentenced Pierre Navelot to 30 years in prison and Laurent Trottin
to 28 years for the 1998 premeditated murder of Alexandra Fernandez, 20,
Trottin's ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution had requested life prison terms for each of the men.
</P>
<P>
	   During the three-day trial, the two had said they had been inspired by the
chilling decapitation murder carried out in the 1995 film ``Seven.''
</P>
<P>
	   Navelot, a 21-year-old student at the time of the murder, and Trottin, a
20-year-old army deserter, planned to mail the victim's head to a former
girlfriend of Navelot.
</P>
<P>
	   They stabbed Fernandez 21 times and slit her throat, but then were caught.
</P>
<P>
	   The men said they had been inspired by the grisly final murder in the film
``Seven,'' which starred Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. In the movie, a serial
killer decapitates a victim and sends her head by mail to her husband, a police
detective.
</P>
<P>
	   In real life, the two men said they bought a knife and hatchet and then
spent several weeks prowling the Metz area for a victim. Finally, Trottin
suggested his ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   Navelot told police that he wanted to send the victim's head in the mail to
his girlfriend Cathia -- who had just left him -- to scare her.
</P>
<P>
	   Navelot, who appeared to be the leader in the crime, told the court that he
had wanted to become ``the No. 1 serial killer.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I imagined that I was somebody good,'' Navelot told the court. ``But, like
the prosecutor said, I'm a monster.''

<HEADLINE> DNC Official Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE DeARMOND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the latest shake-up for organizers of the Democratic
National Convention, the top official charged with raising private donations
resigned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucy McCoy, president of the private, nonpartisan host committee known as LA
Convention 2000, is the second major convention official to quit in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Her departure also comes weeks after Mayor Richard Riordan announced he was
increasing his involvement in planning for the August convention.
</P>
<P>
	   McCoy will be replaced by Deputy Mayor Noelia Rodriguez, who denied reports
that Riordan and McCoy did not get along. McCoy was key in helping the city win
the bid for the convention and overseeing fund-raising efforts by local leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Riordan has not publicly criticized organizers, but his decision to become
more involved followed reports that they were behind schedule on planning and
fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers have insisted they are on schedule, and the host committee said
Wednesday it has raised almost three-fourths of the $35 million to which it is
committed.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Don Foley, who was working part time for the DNC on news media
logistics, resigned Jan. 31, citing demands on his family and his job as a
Northwest Airlines executive.

<HEADLINE> Young Murder Suspect Offered Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A 12-year-old boy charged as an adult with first-degree murder
in the death of a playmate could be allowed to plead to a lesser charge under a
deal offered by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   But the boy's lawyer said he thinks the case will go to trial, and they plan
to argue the child was influenced by the theatrics of professional wrestling.
</P>
<P>
	   Lionel Tate had pleaded innocent in the July 28 death of 6-year-old Tiffany
Eunick.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a deal offered Tuesday by prosecutors, Tate could plead guilty to
second-degree murder, with a recommended sentence of three years in a juvenile
center followed by a year of house arrest, 10 years of probation, psychological
testing and counseling, and 1,000 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
	   Tate has until Feb. 29 to accept.
</P>
<P>
	   Tate's lawyer, James Lewis, was skeptical about accepting the plea bargain,
but said the decision is up to the boy and his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It looks to me like this case is going to trial. That's how I've always
pictured it and we will be ready,'' Lewis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis has maintained the little girl's death was a tragic accident, the
result of a rough-housing game gone too far and based on things Tate had seen on
professional wrestling shows.
</P>
<P>
	   According to police, Tate told officers he grabbed the girl in a bear hug,
then dropped her, causing her to hit her head on a table. He later said he swung
her around and her head struck a cast-iron railing, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
	   A medical examiner said her injuries included a fractured skull, a lacerated
liver and more than 30 other bruises and breaks.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Calls Gore a Latecomer in NY  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bill Bradley accused Democratic rival Al Gore on
Wednesday of ignoring western New York and other places left out of the economic
boom while courting voters elsewhere for the big March 7 primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Going all out in New York, one of the biggest March 7 prizes, Bradley
portrayed Gore as a latecomer to an area that has not shared deeply in the past
decade's economic good times.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley enjoyed rousing ovations at an evening appearance at the Lesbian and
Gay Community Services Center in Manhattan, where he said Gore was late in
standing up for gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're a gay American, you can serve openly in the Congress, in the
judiciary, in the Treasury Department, in the White House,'' Bradley told a
packed house. ``You ought to be able to serve openly in the military.'' Gore, in
December, called for an end to the current policy on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore last week picked up the endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign, the
nation's largest gay and lesbian rights group. Bradley, running as an outsider
despite 18 years in the Senate, asked reporters rhetorically whether that group
is based in Washington. It is.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley continues to accuse Gore of using ``scare tactics'' to discredit his
health care plan. Gore says Bradley's plan to replace Medicaid with a system of
subsidies would leave thousands of people with diseases such as AIDS without
coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Pushing his case in New York, Bradley told students in Rochester that
federal formulas should be adjusted so New York gets a better return on its tax
dollar. But shifting formulas to help New York could reduce federal funding to
places in the South and West -- including California, the biggest delegate
target on March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley acknowledged to reporters that he is behind ``most places'' holding
primaries or caucuses on March 7 or 14, but he added, ``Three weeks is an
eternity in politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Buffalo, Bradley told about 150 supporters and onlookers at Erie
Community College, ``I look out there and see Al Gore says he's been to
California 60 times since he's been vice president. My question to him is, how
many times has he been to western New York?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't come to western New York after being in power seven years and
say you're going to have a program to help those parts of the country that
haven't moved ahead. The question is, where were you for the last seven years?''
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign released a document that contended New Yorkers were ``left out
in the cold'' when the federal government recently released emergency heating
assistance through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire residents got their assistance Jan. 26, a week before the
state's primary, while New York got its largest chunk of money Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire's Jan. 26 allotment broke down to $114.71 per low income
household, compared to $24.01 per New York household on Feb. 10, according to
the Bradley calculations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The timing is interesting,'' Bradley told reporters. ``I realize I'm
running against entrenched power, and part of entrenched power'' is helping
favored candidates win elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway replied, ``News flash to Senator
Bradley: It's cold, and people need help. It's cold in New Hampshire and it's
cold in New York.''
</P>
<P>
	   First in Buffalo, then in Rochester, Bradley challenged students at
community colleges to join him in ``dreaming'' about the future while the
economy is soaring.
</P>
<P>
	   He called for scholarships that require recipients to spend time teaching in
urban or rural schools, pledged additional support to community colleges and
pitched his plan for universal health care, which carries an estimated price tag
of $65 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
	   William Randolph, 27, a warehouse laborer who is studying English, heard
Bradley at Erie Community College.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I like Bradley as a thinker and as an individual who can do something,''
Randolph said, ``but I think it's rather hopeless. People are ill-informed and
he's not going to get enough attention. He lacks the necessary charisma to draw
in the public.''

<HEADLINE> Fed: Rate Cut Won't Help Farmers  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JONESBORO, Ark. (AP) -- The Federal Reserve would not be helping financially
struggling farmers by cutting interest rates, the president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of St. Louis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to hundreds of people from agricultural fields, William Poole said
he understood their pleas for help, but he could not justify a reduction in
interest rates to help boost the farm economy.
</P>
<P>
	   To lower interest rates in attempt to help farmers, would drive up inflation
and hurt the nation as a whole, Poole said at an agriculture conference at
Arkansas State University.
</P>
<P>
	   "Criticize us when we are going off track, but define off track by the
economy as a whole and not by conditions in agriculture alone," Poole said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates four times since June to
try to slow the economy and keep inflation in check. Some economists expect the
Fed to raise interest rates again in March.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers, already facing low prices for many commodities, fear higher
borrowing rates for purchasing seeds and equipment could widen losses or cut
into slim profits.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know that interest rate fluctuations can cause problems in agriculture,"
Poole said. "But there is no other known way to keep inflation low and stable."
</P>
<P>
	   To change the Fed's monetary policy in order to help farmers would "actually
make things worse by generating instability in the inflation rate, interest
rates and the level of economic activity," Poole said.
</P>
<P>
	   Poole told reporters afterward that "the balance of risks is on the side of
inflation."
</P>
<P>
	   During 1999, the rate of inflation according to the Consumer Price Index,
was 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   During the next six months to a couple of years, "There's a higher
probability that the inflation rate might be a half percentage point higher than
there is a probability that the inflation rate might be a half percentage point
lower," Poole said.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal of the Federal Reserve is to keep inflation near the average of the
past five years, regardless of how farmers are affected, Poole said.
</P>
<P>
	   The problems in agriculture, Poole said, are due not so much to higher
interest rates as to a high supply and a relatively stable demand for food that
is causing prices to fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Poole contrasted agriculture with the computer industry, which also has seen
falling prices and high supply. The difference, he said, is that a strong
economy increases the demand for computers but does not typically affect
people's demand for food.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the agricultural outlook for the next couple of decades isn't much
different -- improved technology should continue to increase the food supply,
and prices may gradually decline.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers today should realize that their financial troubles are not
unprecedented, and not as bad as in some previous decades, Poole said.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1990 to 1998, for example, net farm income averaged $47.7 billion -- 20
percent more than the 1980s average of $39.8 billion. Yet in the 1970s, even
while inflation gripped the nation, net farm income averaged $62.7 billion, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "My point is merely to state that farming is an inherently risky business,"
Poole told the agriculture conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Later he told reporters, the current state of agriculture is nothing over
which to panic.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very, very typical of agriculture over the last 100 years or more.
This is not an unusual circumstance," Poole said. "When you're caught of up in
it, of course, you may loose sight of the historical trends."

<HEADLINE> Bush Breaks Spending Records  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain has dramatically closed the money gap against
George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate who has spent a
record-shattering $50 million in a front-running campaign that McCain is
threatening to upend.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had $20 million in the bank as of Jan. 31 and had been spending at a
rate of $3 million a week even before ratcheting up following his loss to McCain
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, reported having $10 million available to spend as of
mid-February, two thirds of which is money he can borrow against federal funds
he will receive later. After his landslide victory over Bush in New Hampshire's
leadoff primary, McCain's fund-raising surged: He is collecting $150,000 to
$200,000 a day via the Internet in addition to his big-ticket fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
	   At the start of the year, Bush had $31.4 million in the bank, while McCain
had $1.5 million plus $4.2 million in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a world of difference from what it was a month ago,'' said Larry
Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a research
group that studies money and campaigns. ``McCain really is within financial
striking distance here if he can keep this momentum going.''
</P>
<P>
	   Going into the year, Bush's biggest advantages were his financial warchest
and the perception that he would coast to the nomination. Both assets have
shrunk since New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is trying to replenish his funds, having already raised a record of
more than $70 million. He is planning four or five fund-raisers in March,
campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   He needs the money because he has also set records for spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spent $13 million in January, bringing his total to $50 million for the
campaign, well over the $42.2 million Bob Dole spent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, spent $12 million over the past six weeks -- almost as
much as the $14 million he spent during all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is when you're supposed to spend your money,'' McCain spokesman
Howard Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because he is accepting federal funds for his campaign, McCain has a limit
on how much he can spend. The limit is around $40 million, plus additional funds
for some legal and accounting costs. McCain so far has spent around $26 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is not accepting federal funds for his campaign and can keep raising
and spending as much as he wants.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in South Carolina, where he is competing against McCain in
Saturday's GOP primary, Bush said he was not concerned about his campaign
spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got a plan in place that's going to enable me to stay in this race
for the long run,'' Bush said. ``We have been fighting in every primary state,
we're on plan and I think I've got a good chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
	   Former Rep. Bill Paxon, a Bush adviser, said the campaign was spending money
not only to win the nomination but the general election as well.
</P>

	   Much of Bush's money is going for television. Fleischer said Bush was on the
air in seven states: South Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Washington, North
Dakota, Virginia and California. Opinsky said McCain is on the air in five
states: South Carolina, Michigan, Virginia, Washington and California.
</P>
<P>
	   A computer analysis of Bush's campaign spending through Dec. 31 showed that
he had spent $6.3 million on television -- more than any other presidential
candidate. McCain had spent $2.6 million. Dole spent $7 million for his entire
1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An army moves on its belly as they say, and when you make a conscious
decision that they have made to build an organization, it costs money,'' said
Ron Kaufman, who was White House political director under President Bush and now
is supporting his son. ``In the end it is all about organization and TV. I
believe very strongly that no state is going to be lost by George W. Bush
because of a lack of money.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Approves Anti-Loitering Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Eight months after the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated
Chicago's anti-loitering law, the City Council has approved a new ordinance
aimed at keeping gangs from congregating.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Richard Daley's office had been crafting the new law since the high
court last June ruled the old ordinance -- which resulted in 45,000 arrests over
three years -- was unconstitutionally vague.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1992 ordinance required police to order any group of people standing
around with no apparent purpose to move along if an officer believed at least
one of them belonged to a street gang. Those who disregarded the order faced
arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   The new ordinance, which goes into effect in 30 days, calls for the police
superintendent to designate specific areas ``hot spots'' of gang activity and
drug trafficking after consulting with community leaders, residents and others.
People loitering in the ``hot spots'' could be ordered to leave for three hours
or risk arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics said the new law is still too vague, including the actual size of
the ``hot spots'' and how long they would be designated as such.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In fact it may increase the kind of activity it is designed to prevent,''
said University of Chicago law professor Stephen Schulhofer. ``When you force
gangs off their turf you tend to set off turf battles within gangs or between
gangs.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico OKs National Colors in Logo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's governing party can continue using a logo made
in the colors of the national flag in its campaign for presidential elections,
an electoral court ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition parties had lodged complaints that the red, white and green logo
used by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in its campaign and on
the July 2 ballot gave it an unfair advantage by identifying the party with
national pride.
</P>
<P>
	   The Electoral Tribunal, however, said the appeals were unfounded, as neither
the PRI, nor any other party, had exclusive access to the colors.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling cannot be appealed, the Formato 21 radio station reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The PRI -- which has dominated the Mexican political system for 70 years --
is favored to win the upcoming elections with candidate Francisco Labastida.
</P>
<P>
	   In January the electoral court blocked attempts by main opposition candidate
Vicente Fox to get his image in a ``V-for-victory'' pose included in his
electoral coalition's logo on the ballot. The court said the symbol violated
electoral laws, as it boosted a specific candidate rather than represented a
party.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox represents a coalition formed especially for the election, called the
Alliance for Change and made up of the candidate's own center-right National
Action Party and the small Green party.

<HEADLINE> 'Rita's Legends' Premieres in Berlin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BERLIN (AP) -- German director Volker Schloendorff raced to finish his movie
"Rita's Legends" for its world premiere Wednesday at the Berlin International
Film Festival, saying it would not have been understood as well anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
	   The movie revolves around a former left-wing terrorist who had fled to East
Germany to start a new life. When the Berlin Wall falls, however, she is
exposed. The film -- based on real cases -- juxtaposes her loss with the new
freedoms experienced by her East German friends.
</P>
<P>
	   After first considering a later release of the film timed for the Cannes
festival, Schloendorff changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
	   "What would this film mean in Cannes?" he asked at a post-screening news
conference. "The people there don't understand the difference between East and
West."
</P>
<P>
	   Working more than five years to get the film started, Schloendorff blamed
the setbacks on a mistrust Germans have to supporting their own movies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody believes in German movies," he said. "We send millions of dollars
every year to America to invest in their films. We need more faith in our
films."
</P>
<P>
	   Schloendorff won an Oscar in 1980 for "The Tin Drum," an anti-war story
based on a book by Nobel Prize-winning author Guenter Grass.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Addresses Black Educators  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked an audience of black educators
Wednesday to recall the national sense of peace and optimism during the last
period of broad prosperity in the early 1960s -- and to reflect on how quickly
that moment shattered in war and civil strife.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just remember where you were ... the last time America thought everything
was going to be all right more or less automatically,'' Clinton said during an
unusually emotional address to an association of historically black colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The great test of people in this age will be what we do with our good
feelings,'' about American power and prosperity, and whether Americans waste a
golden moment to do good, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How many times have you made a mistake and failed ... not because you were
under duress but because things were going so well you thought there were no
consequences to taking your eye off the prize?'' Clinton asked a convention of
the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said that as America approached an economic milestone this month --
the longest economic expansion in the nation's history -- he researched the last
sustained expansion, from 1961 to 1968.
</P>
<P>
	   At the dawn of the Johnson administration, Clinton said, the economy was
good, the nation was at peace and Americans were united in the belief that they
could recover from the heartbreak of John F. Kennedy's assassination while
dealing squarely with the growing challenge of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 1964 I graduated high school into an America that was the nearest like
this America,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Two years later, we had riots in the streets, a half a million people in
Vietnam, the country was beginning to be deeply divided,'' he added. By the time
Clinton graduated from college in 1968, ``the streets were burning in
Washington, D.C., and the country was broken and divided and we decided the
presidential election on the politics of division.''
</P>
<P>
	   The speech was a variation on Clinton's usual address to Democratic
audiences, in which he warns of the risk of wasting budget surpluses on large
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton seemed to take many in his audience by surprise when, with a
tear glinting in his eye, he leaned forward and beseeched the crowd to listen
carefully.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have waited 35 years and some months for my country to be in a position
to build a future of our dreams for all our children,'' he said softly. ``We
dare not blow this.''

<HEADLINE> Northwest Reduces BizFlex Offerings  </HEADLINE>
    By KARREN MILLS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Just six days after announcing its new lower-priced
business fares, Northwest Airlines said Wednesday it was reducing the markets
where it offers the BizFlex pricing.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're taking it out of competitors' hubs," said Kathy Peach, spokeswoman
for the nation's fourth-largest airline. The decision was made in response to
"competitive reaction" to the new fares, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   That means the fares -- which are 40 percent cheaper than unrestricted full
coach walkup fares and do not require a Saturday night stay -- are not available
to business travelers out of Chicago; Denver; Newark, N.J.; Dallas; Atlanta; and
other airline hubs unless the traveler is headed to one of Northwest's hubs in
Minneapolis-St. Paul, Detroit or Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   Travelers between Chicago and Los Angeles, Newark and San Francisco, or
Washington and Denver, for example, will not be able to obtain BizFlex fares,
said consumer advocate Terry Trippler, an airline expert with 1travel.com.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were getting killed in some markets because some airlines matched the
fares and took away the advance purchase requirement. My contention is, it
doesn't matter. Then you match the no advance purchase," Trippler said.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest maintains the BizFlex fares are still available in more than 90
percent of its markets, in more than 250 U.S. and Canadian cities.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most people who travel on Northwest go through our hubs," Peach said. "From
a total market perspective, about 60 percent of U.S. passengers have BizFlex
fares available to them."
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest said when it announced the new class of business fares Feb. 10
that it expected competitors to fully match the fares, which require a roundtrip
purchase at least 10 days in advance and a one night minimum stay. BizFlex fares
are nonrefundable and subject to a $75 change fee.
</P>
<P>
	   The fares are about 10 percent more expensive than Saturday night stay fares
purchased 14 days in advance and cost 20 percent to 30 percent more than
restricted tickets purchased at least 21 days before travel.
</P>
<P>
	   When Northwest announced the BizFlex fares, Tim Griffin, executive vice
president for marketing and distribution, said they would be available
throughout the United States and Canada.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Takes on War Crimes  </HEADLINE>
   By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Judge Patricia Wald saw her fair share of
strife through 20 years of high-profile litigation at the federal appeals court
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Her cases dealt with Kenneth Starr's alleged grand jury leaks to the press,
former White House aide Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra felony conviction, the
Microsoft antitrust suit, and a series of proceedings arising from the Watergate
scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   But when her first trial at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal gets under way
later this month, Wald will have to grapple with accusations of systematic rape,
torture and massacres committed as part of the bloody ``ethnic cleansing''
campaigns in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some of my friends said: 'You're going from one war tribunal to
another,''' she recalled Tuesday in an interview with The Associated Press in
her office at the U.N. court.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribunal was set up seven years ago by the U.N. Security Council to
prosecute suspected war criminals from the conflicts that followed the
fragmentation of Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Wald joined the 14-judge court in November, succeeding Gabrielle Kirk
McDonald, who returned to the United States after six years on the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   A Connecticut native and Yale Law School graduate, Wald has practiced law
since 1952. In 1979, President Carter appointed her to the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the occasional lighthearted remark, Wald describes her mission here
with utmost seriousness. Nothing less than the promise of universal human rights
protection, enshrined in international treaties, is at stake, she believes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If all of the Hague conventions and Geneva conventions are really going to
mean anything, there has to be some kind of enforcement mechanism,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her first war crimes trial, scheduled to begin Feb. 28, will be the case of
Miroslav Kvocka and several other alleged commanders and guards of the Omarska,
Keraterm and Trnopolje prison camps in northwestern Bosnia, where inmates were
raped, tortured, beaten and murdered.
</P>
<P>
	   As one of the tribunal's two female judges, she said she can bring a
different perspective to the trials, much in the same way she did in sex
discrimination suits at the federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there are some cases, and they don't always have to be sex
discrimination cases, where your particular insights or particular experience as
a woman will add something or will give you a different lens through which to
see the case,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But, she added, ``all the members of the court are sensitized to this whole
aspect of the particular unique abuses that women often suffer when they get
caught in the middle of one of these turmoils. It's an added aspect of
endangerment for them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like many judges and legal experts, Wald sees the Yugoslav tribunal as a
precursor to a permanent international court with jurisdiction to punish
perpetrators of atrocities anywhere in the world. The United States was one of
the few countries to oppose the International Criminal Court when its proposed
statute was drafted at a 1998 conference in Rome.
</P>
<P>
	   Wald understands why some Americans might find it ``a little scary'' that,
at least in theory, U.S. servicemen accused of abuses could be hauled before the
proposed court.
</P>
<P>
	   But she feels the Clinton administration and vehement opponents of the
court, such as North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms, exaggerate the potential for
political vendettas against the United States or American soldiers, ``unless
they really did commit something terribly bad.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``These tribunals are so busy, believe me, they're not going to go looking
for somebody who's really on the margins,'' she said. ``And the fact that
they're international tribunals means they can't be dominated by some nation
that's mad at the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Testimony abruptly ends in federal trial of accused drug lords  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Testimony abruptly ended Wednesday in the drug
conspiracy trial of two reputed kingpins accused of running the biggest cocaine
cartel in Camden's history.
<P>
	   The defense, which had subpoenaed at least a dozen city police officers,
rested its case without calling them. Five officers nervously paced in the
hallway for several hours before the defense decision was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Joseph H. Rodriguez rejected a defense motion
Wednesday to dismiss charges against Jose "J.R." Rivera and Luis "Tun Tun"
Figueroa.
</P>
<P>
	   The case will proceed to a jury to decide after hearing closing arguments
scheduled for Feb. 24. The jury began hearing testimony last month in what has
been described as one of the biggest drug prosecutions in Camden's history.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera and Figueroa are accused of conspiring to distribute hundreds of tons
of cocaine in Camden. Rivera is also accused of laundering drug profits through
his businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   They are the only two among 15 defendants charged in the case to stand
trial. If convicted, both face life in prison. The others pleaded guilty to drug
charges and many testified against them.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense argued Wednesday that prosecutors failed to make their case to
establish probable cause beyond a reasonable doubt and asked the judge to acquit
both defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge, however, agreed with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   "My view of the record is that there's more than sufficient evidence, if
considered in the light most favorable to the government, that the elements of
the offenses have been established," Rodriguez ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sidebar conference with the judge, the attorneys and prosecutors,
Rivera and Figueroa said they had decided against testifying, according to court
transcripts. Both defendants told the judge they understood their rights.
</P>
<P>
	   With that, both defense lawyers rested their cases. Assistant U.S. Attorney
Kevin Smith said prosecutors had no rebuttal witness to call. Rodriguez then
sent the jury home until next week.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a dramatic end to the trial, in its seventh week, where riveting
testimony by admitted drug dealers has implicated political figures and police
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Five convicted drug dealers have testified that Mayor Milton Milan - before
becoming the city's mayor in 1997 - sold drugs and bought bulk quantities of
cocaine from the ring.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan is not charged in the case and has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera's attorney, Marc Neff, had left open the possibility that the defense
would call at least one Camden police officer to testify Wednesday. It was not
revealed what the testimony would have included.
</P>
<P>
	   Neff, however, said he met with the witness, whom he did not identify, for
several hours Tuesday and decided not to call any additional witnesses on behalf
of Rivera. He gave no reason for the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, prosecutors turned over a box of documents to the defense, and
the judge recessed the trial to give the defense time to review the materials
before calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The documents were believed to be evidence that could have been used to
impeach the credibility of testimony by some of the police officers. Among those
subpoenaed was a 13-year veteran captured on tape advising Rivera on how to
handle narcotics investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   During the federal trial, drug dealers have named current and former city
police officers who they said tipped them off to raids or shook them down for
bribes.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have said the multimillion dollar drug ring flourished in Camden
for nearly a decade, in part, because of its close ties to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization primarily supplied drugs for two open-air drug markets in
the city, authorities said. It has been described as the most entrenched drug
cartel in Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera, 40, of Cherry Hill, who owns a gym and an auto parts store, is the
accused financier of the drug organization. Figueroa, 34, of Camden, prosecutors
allege, was its enforcer.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the drug ring used threats, violence and even murder to
control a lucrative drug market. The organization was eventually toppled in
February 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   During the trial, jurors heard graphic testimony about the 1993 slaying of a
rival drug dealer who was shot because he planned to set up his own drug set.
Figueroa, identified by prosecutors as the triggerman, faces trial in state
court on a murder charge in that case.

<HEADLINE> China Dissident Gets Six Years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A Chinese court has handed a six-year jail term to a
dissident convicted of subversion for his part in organizing a would-be
opposition party, a human rights group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Liu Shizun, who worked as an assistant to dissident Xu Wenli, now also in
jail, was sentenced Wednesday in the northeastern city of Dalian, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Liu's sentencing comes ahead of the annual session of the U.N. Human Rights
Commission at Geneva. The United States wants to censure China at the six-week
meeting beginning in March because of what it says has been a steady
deterioration in China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
	   Liu, 38, is the 21st leader of the China Democracy Party to be imprisoned on
subversion charges since the government began cracking down on the group in late
1998, the Information Center said. Seventeen of those were sentenced in 1999.
Another 15 are awaiting sentencing, the center said.
</P>
<P>
	   In convicting Liu, the Dalian Intermediate People's Court said he helped Xu
Wenli set up a branch of the party in Beijing and the nearby port of Tianjin in
1998 and also set up another branch in Dalian in 1999, the group said.
</P>
<P>
	   Xu is serving a 13-year jail term handed down in December 1998 at the start
of the crackdown on the party.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Xu, Liu said he would not appeal, the group said. Chinese courts
invariably reject dissidents' appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   Liu was detained last September 17 and tried this January 27, although his
wife was only informed in writing of the sentence on Wednesday, the group said.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton says she's got no interest in being president  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday that she expects
to win the Senate race but that she has no interest in using that position to
run for president.
<P>
	   "I really want to be the senator, and I want to serve my full six-year term,
and I have learned that senators have a whole lot more privacy than presidents,"
she said in an interview with Charlie Rose at the 92nd St. Y. "It is not a
choice I'm looking at, interested in -- I want to be the very best senator I can
be."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Rose asked her what she would do if she lost the race against her
Republican rival, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, I am going to win," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rose also asked her if part of her ups and downs in the White House was due
to the public's unwillingness to accept a strong first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's a problem with the role of first lady," she said. "It's not a
job. It's a role, which people mold to their desires and interests, which I
think is appropriate, and someday the first man will have the same options."
</P>
<P>
	   Rose tried to get Clinton to explain her much-discussed baseball
allegiances. "Yankees or Mets?" he badgered.
</P>
<P>
	   "The last time I tried to explain that to New Yorkers I got in so much
trouble, I've actually given up," replied Clinton, who grew up in a Chicago
suburb. "I can't convince anybody that I cared about the Yankees so I don't want
to go there."
</P>
<P>
	   Rose teased her about the line "I make a mean tossed salad," which she used
in the video about her that was shown when she formally announced her candidacy.
She also said in the video that she makes a good omelet.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought that was a funny way of saying I can't cook," she explained. "I
can tear lettuce and break eggs."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was invited to speak at the Y to mark the dedication of the Lillian
&AMP; Sol Goldman Family Center for Youth &AMP; Family. The Goldman family - which runs
a Manhattan-based firm, Sol Goldman Investments - gave $5 million to support the
Y's programs for children and parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Tickets to the sold-out event ranged from $20 to $100 and proceeds go to the
Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has accepted an invitation to appear at the Y on May
18. Details of whether it will be an interview, a town meeting or some other
format are still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
	   The 92nd Street Y is nonpartisan and has long been a popular stop for
politicians. Eleanor Roosevelt lectured there in her day, and Bill Bradley
rented space there last fall to announce that his presidential campaign was
being endorsed by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Vice President Al Gore attended
a Hanukkah menorah lighting in December, and Republican presidential contender
Sen. John McCain recently talked about his book, "Faith of My Fathers," as part
of the Y's interview series.

land conservation system during a speech on Thursday at the University of
Denver.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have created an entirely new and visionary system,'' Babbitt said in a
statement released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The new system, tentatively called National Landscape Monuments, would be
operated by the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
	   Babbitt's release said he will describe the new program and explain why the
BLM will supervise instead of the National Park Service or the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Areas that will fall under the new system include the Grand
Staircase-Escalante in Utah, Grand Canyon Parashant in Arizona and Headwaters
Reserve in California, the release said.
</P>
<P>
	   Babbitt and President Clinton have said they want to protect more federal
lands in the West before leaving office in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Clinton announced a plan that would grant national monument
designation to thousands of small islands off the California coast and expanses
of rugged Arizona desert. Babbitt recommended the additional protection, and
Clinton is to make a final decision on the proposals next year.

<HEADLINE> Gore checks tornado damage; Bradley hits him on fuel-aid timing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) - Al Gore took a taxpayer-funded helicopter detour to
inspect Georgia tornado damage on Wednesday, blurring lines between his vice
presidential duties and the presidential race.
<P>
	   Separately, Democratic rival Bill Bradley suggested the administration was
using cold-weather aid in the Northeast to boost Gore in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   With candidates' remaining money becoming more of a factor, the vice
president's politically beneficial government duties are expected to increase.
On Friday, his Black History Month appeal to black voters takes the form of an
official address to the Africa Summit in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   He's not shy about pointing out the two roles.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I leave here, I'm going to be leaving as vice president ... but while
I'm here I want to ask for your help in my campaign," Gore told 150 supporters
Wednesday outside Air Force Two during a pit stop in Macon.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokeswoman Laura Quinn said local officials, knowing Gore had planned a
campaign town-hall forum in Macon, asked him instead to tour the tornado
disaster. "A very small fraction" of the cost of the day's activities was being
shifted to the government, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has about $18 million - to Bradley's $20 million - in campaign funds at
his disposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Following Bradley's lead on another subject Wednesday, the vice president
belatedly condemned President Clinton's nomination of Bradley Smith, a
Republican who opposes the overhaul of the campaign finance system, to the board
of the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   "The last thing we need is an FEC commissioner who publicly questions not
only the constitutionality of proposed reform but also the constitutionality of
current limitations," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans had been insisting on the nomination for months - it's
traditional that each party gets to choose half the commission - and Clinton
reluctantly made it official this week.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Bradley criticized Gore for not protesting to Clinton before
the appointment. "I did not know that the nomination was pending," Gore said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He said being unaware of the situation wasn't unusual since "I'm out on the
road full-time now."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's final shot: "I said it last week and he said it this week. That's
par for the course. I take a position and a week later, he takes the same
position."
</P>
<P>
	   In Buffalo and Rochester, Bradley accused Gore of ignoring places like
western New York in his courtship of other states.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also suggested the administration had based its release of
cold-weather relief money on the primary schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to 150 supporters and onlookers at Erie Community College in
Buffalo, Bradley said, "You can't come to western New York after being in power
seven years and say you're going to have a program to help those parts of the
country that haven't moved ahead. The question is, where were you for the last
seven years?"
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign released a document alleging New Yorkers were "left out in the
cold" when the government released emergency heating assistance through the Low
Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>
	   The document shows New Hampshire residents got an infusion of aid Jan. 26, a
week before the state's primary, while New York, which holds its primary March
7, got its largest chunk of money Feb. 10. New York also got less money per
household.
</P>
<P>
	   "The timing is interesting," Bradley said. "I realize I'm running against
entrenched power," and part of entrenched power is helping a favored candidate,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign's response was quick and short.
</P>
<P>
	   "News flash to Senator Bradley: It's cold and people need help. It's cold in
New Hampshire and it's cold in New York."
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Bradley was releasing a new television ad on abortion - his
second on the issue. The two Democratic rivals agree on abortion now, but
Bradley has been hammering Gore on his early record, including opposition to
Medicaid funding for abortion. The spot comes two days after Gore's endorsement
by a leading abortion rights group.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also released a new ad, a remake of a New Hampshire spot, depicting him
as a fighter who took on polluters, would-be Medicare cutters and insurance
companies opposed to a "patients bill of rights." It says Gore is committed to
"preserving Medicaid" - a gentle reminder of his attacks on Bradley's plan to
replace Medicaid with a new program.
</P>
<P>
	   In Georgia, Gore helicoptered over the four counties hit by twisters this
week, landing in Camilla and walking through an all-but-obliterated area that
emergency officials called "ground zero" in an area that accounted for 13 of the
state's total 18 fatalities.
</P>
<P>
	   "What do you guys make of all this? Pretty scary, wasn't it?" he said to one
family. "Call me if there's anything I can do," he said, giving them the
toll-free number for federal aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's day, from his sleepover and breakfast at the North Carolina
Governor's Mansion to his flight aboard a military helicopter to tour the
tornado damage, showed the advantages of incumbency.
</P>
<P>
	   He later flew to New Orleans for an address to AFL-CIO leaders Thursday.

<HEADLINE> German Ambassador Tours Chiapas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUXTLA, Mexico (AP) -- Germany's ambassador to Mexico began a five-day tour
of Chiapas Wednesday, saying he wanted to find out for himself what was going on
in the troubled southern state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to know about the armed conflict in Chiapas that occupies the front
pages of German newspapers,'' Ambassador Wolf Ruthar Born said, adding he would
record his findings in a report to his government.
</P>
<P>
	   Chiapas is home to the Zapatista National Liberation Army which staged a
brief uprising in January 1994 in the name of greater Indian rights. Since then
scores of people have died in clashes between rebels, or rebel supporters, and
armed, pro-government vigilante squads.
</P>
<P>
	   Born also pointed to existing German investments in Mexico, and the
possibilities for commerce opened up by the recently negotiated free trade
agreement between Mexico and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   On the fist day of his visit to Chiapas the ambassador met with the state's
governor Roberto Albores. He was also expected to tour Indian communities and
meet with non-governmental organizations working in the conflictive regions.

<HEADLINE> Funerals Held for Tornado Victims  </HEADLINE>
   By ERIN McCLAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PELHAM, Ga. (AP) -- A little Baptist church overflowed Wednesday with
mourners for the congregation's pastor and his wife, the first victims of the
Georgia tornadoes to be laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
	   Union Hill Primitive Baptist Church, which seats about 200 people, had to
set up speakers so friends and relatives outside in the sunlight could hear
tributes to Jackie and Mary Ann McClelland, both 64, who were killed Monday when
a twister thrashed their home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's difficult to stand here and try to express to you that God is a God
of love,'' the Rev. Cleston Brooks told mourners. ``But do not let this harden
your heart. It's not for you and I to choose when our time will come.''
</P>
<P>
	   The tornadoes that struck rural Georgia killed 18 people, including six in
Grady County, where the McClellands lived all their lives. Authorities reduced
the death toll from 22 to 18 Wednesday, saying confusion in the aftermath of the
storms led to four people being counted twice.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. McClelland was director of the county health department and planned to
retire March 31. Her husband, a retired farmer who became a pastor in 1996, used
to pace his house working on sermons when he couldn't sleep.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were people that other people cherished,'' said Junior Peeples, a
relative. ``And they went together -- to go with the one you shared your life
with, that's a special meaning.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 20 miles away in Cairo, mourners gathered for services for another
storm victim, Gloria Jean Eglinton, a 54-year-old bank teller.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some people can love the unlovable. Jeannie liked frogs,'' the Rev.
DeWayne Atkinson said. ``God gave her this personality -- this outgoing, bubbly
personality. She was a friend to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
	   More funerals were planned for later in the week as survivors of the storm
made plans to rebuild their homes and their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   In Camilla, about 10 miles north of Pelham and 40 miles from the Florida
line, families met with insurance adjusters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The storms sent a pine tree crashing through Phyllis Malcom's roof and
destroyed two bedrooms. But she said that abandoning the place she has called
home for 13 years is not an option.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll rebuild,'' she said. ``People said, `We'll get you out of here.' But
we don't want to. It's home.''
</P>
<P>
	   Insurance representatives drove the streets of a subdivision hit hard by the
storms, offering victims money to pay for temporary housing and asking them to
make lists of items damaged beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hate to see family heirlooms lost,'' said Jenna Rowlett of State Farm
Insurance. ``That's the one thing I can't replace.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Weather Service said Wednesday it had determined that three
tornadoes touched down in southwestern Georgia early Monday. The deadliest
roared through Mitchell County with winds as high as 200 mph and cut a 10-mile
path of devastation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Insurance Information Institute put the total Georgia storm damage at
$25 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal, state and local authorities plan to set up a temporary housing park
with 40 units -- 32 mobile homes and eight campers -- for displaced families
early next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Department of Labor said it was awarding an emergency disaster
grant of up to $6 million to create jobs to repair damage caused by the storms.
</P>
<P>
	   At the funeral in Pelham, a choir sang ``Amazing Grace'' and a recording of
``My Heart Will Go On'' was played. The McClellands were remembered as two of
Grady County's most generous people.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the service, Tommy Taylor, who had known Jackie McClelland since
boyhood, walked among the twisted remains of their white farmhouse. A sofa
sagged on top of a fallen tree like a deflated balloon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it can get any worse than here,'' Taylor said. ``I don't
ever want to see this again.''

<HEADLINE> Mohegans planning $800 million expansion to casino complex  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   UNCASVILLE, Conn. (AP) - The Mohegan Indians are planning an $800
million expansion to their casino complex, including a hotel, convention center,
shops and other amenities, the tribe said Wednesday.
<P>
	   The development is expected to create about 4,000 permanent jobs and
increase the Mohegan Sun's stature as a rival to the larger and older Foxwoods
Resort Casino, operated by the neighboring Mashantucket Pequots.
</P>
<P>
	   The construction is already underway and is expected to be completed by the
spring of 2002, said Mitchell Etess, executive vice president of marketing for
Mohegan Sun.
</P>
<P>
	   The $325 million Mohegan Sun opened in October 1996. It was originally built
without a hotel. But it was built without a hotel and that affected the amount
of time people could stay at the casino, Etess said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The hotel's going to create a whole new business for us in the meeting and
convention business," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The project will be paid with $360 million worth of high-yield bonds and a
loan from Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
	   By the numbers, the expansion plans include a 1,200-room hotel, 100,000
square feet of convention space with 30 meeting rooms and a 40,000-square-foot
ballroom.
</P>
<P>
	   The 40-story hotel tower will visible from Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribe also plans to built a 175,000-square-foot retail complex offering
brand-name merchandise, a 10,000-seat arena and 115,000 square feet of new
casino space, to accommodate 2,500 more slot machines and 75 more table games.
</P>
<P>
	   The old casino has an Earth-based theme, and the new addition will invoke
images of the sky.
</P>
<P>
	   A centerpiece of the expansion is a six-story alabaster tower with a
cocktail lounge and a planetarium dome with projections of the heavens.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, crystals and multicolored beads will reflect light around the new
casino, said David Rockwell, an architect with Rockwellgroup who is helping
design the casino.
</P>
<P>
	   "It gives us the chance to create something that is much more than just a
casino," Rockwell said. "This is going to take it to a way, way different
level."
</P>
<P>
	   The Mohegans' casino will still be smaller than the Mashantucket's Foxwoods
Resort Casino, which opened in 1992. The Mohegan Sun has 280,000 square feet of
gambling space, compared with 315,310 square feet at Foxwoods. The new hotel
will have 1,200 rooms, while the grand hotel at Foxwoods has 1,416.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob DeSalvio, a vice president of marketing at Foxwoods Resort Casino, said
the Mashantuckets wish their neighbors well.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're firm believers that the project that they're putting forth is
actually very good for the region," DeSalvio said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Leads McCain in National Poll  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush retains a healthy lead over Sen. John
McCain in the Republican presidential race, but his lead over Democratic
opponents has shrunk, says a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released Wednesday.
McCain fares better than Bush against Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, governor of Texas, leads the Arizona senator, 58 percent to 31 percent
while Alan Keyes has 3 percent in the poll. Gore, the vice president, leads
Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, 64 percent to 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush remains ahead among GOP candidates, the polls no longer support
his claim to be the strongest GOP candidate for the November general election.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has a slight edge over Bradley and Gore among likely voters in the
poll, but McCain has a 16-point lead over Gore, 55-39, and a 23-point lead over
Bradley, 56-33, among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Bush had a 19-point lead over Gore in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup
poll, and an 11-point lead over Bradley. But Bush lost the New Hampshire GOP
primary to McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush frequently tries to make the case that he is the strongest candidate
for the GOP in November, and for months the polls supported that.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bush is caught in a close fight with McCain in South Carolina and
Michigan, and trailing in Arizona, according to polls in those states with
primaries in the next few days. McCain has narrowed the gap with Bush in
delegate-rich states like California and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The polls remain fluid and a survey by the Vanishing Voter Project
illustrates why.
</P>
<P>
	   When Americans are asked which candidate they support at this time, but are
given the option of admitting they haven't picked a candidate yet, the clear
leader is ``no candidate yet.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are seeing in this early stage is a lot of 'top-of-mind
response,'' said Thomas Patterson, co-director of the Vanishing Voter Project,
which is run by the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public
Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
	   The national poll of 1,050 adults was taken Monday and Tuesday and has an
error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points, and plus or minus 5
percentage points for likely voters.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Candidate Offers China Policy  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNIE HUANG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Releasing his long-awaited China policy, the ruling
Nationalist Party's candidate said Thursday that he favors setting up a trade
zone and reviewing Taiwan's ban on direct shipping and air links with its
longtime rival.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Lien Chan tempered his proposals, saying they could only be
carried out if Beijing ended its hostility toward Taiwan and responded to his
government in concrete, positive ways.
</P>
<P>
	   Most polls show Lien in third place in a tight three-way race, and he
desperately needs a boost in the final weeks before the March 18 ballot.
However, his China policy was not substantially different from those proposed by
the other two main candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Since China and Taiwan split amid civil war in 1949, Taiwan has banned
direct shipping and air links with the mainland. Much of the $20 billion in
annual trade between the two sides flows through Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Lien said that after the two sides join the World Trade
Organization, expected this year, he would review Taiwan's ban on shipping and
air links and possibly end the restriction.
</P>
<P>
	   Lien also said that he would consider setting up a direct trade zone with
China's eastern Fujian Province and Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen and
Matsu.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidate said both sides should have exchanges between their military
officials and set up a hotline for their political leaders. He also urged
China's top envoy with Taiwan, Wang Daohan, to visit the island and help set up
a summit between leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the other two main candidates, Lien said he could not accept Beijing's
demand that the two sides reunify under a ``one country, two systems'' model,
similar to one used for the former British colony of Hong Kong and the former
Portuguese enclave of Macau. The model has allowed the two territories a
substantial amount of political autonomy.
</P>
<P>
	   Lien said he supported the China policy of President Lee Teng-hui, who will
retire after the election. Lee insists that China and Taiwan should have an
equal, ``special state-to-state'' relationship -- a stance that has infuriated
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   The other two main candidates are independent James Soong and former Taipei
Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party -- Taiwan's largest
opposition party.

<HEADLINE> Congo Envoy Denies Accusations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Congo's U.N. envoy has confirmed the execution of 19
soldiers, but denied accusations that the country broke a moratorium on
executions.
</P>
<P>
	   Ambassador Andre Kapanga said Wednesday that Congo's minister of human
rights had expressed the country's intention to have a moratorium on the
execution of criminals in the army.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said the moratorium hasn't been instituted yet because the United
Nations hasn't responded to a request from Congo last June for help in building
maximum security prisons to keep such criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberto Garreton, the U.N. human rights expert on Congo, expressed deep
dismay in a statement Tuesday that the 19 soldiers had been executed despite
what he said was a moratorium on death sentences.
</P>
<P>
	   Garreton said the minister, Leonard She Okitundu, announced the moratorium
on Dec. 10 and reaffirmed it in a meeting with him in New York on Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   But Kapanga insisted the moratorium isn't in effect yet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is the intention of the Democratic Republic of Congo to have a
moratorium on killings, but nothing has been announced officially,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kapanga accused Garreton and U.N. Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson of
failing to condemn the killings of 7,000 civilians in eastern Congo in the last
two months, and focusing instead on ``criminals'' in the army.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The soldiers that Mr. Garreton are talking about are criminal people.
These are people who killed, who raped, who stole with guns. They had to appear
in front of a Military Court and a judgment was pronounced against them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations said Garreton received information that 19 soldiers were
executed between Jan. 28 and Feb. 2, hours after being sentenced to death by
Congo's Military Court for murder, armed robbery or revolt.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixty-one other people sentenced to death by the court could also be
executed soon, the U.N. statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Garreton, the sentences cannot be appealed and are ``unfair and
incompatible'' with provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights which Congo has signed.

<HEADLINE> Kid Gets Money After Alleged Theft  </HEADLINE>
   By REBECCA COOK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- Eleven-year-old Blake Topping sold his prize-winning
calf at the Gray's Harbor County fair this winter for $1,900 -- money he planned
to use for college.
</P>
<P>
	   But prosecutors say the foster child's case worker at the state Department
of Social and Health Services took the money and gambled it away.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was sort of stunned,'' the boy said. ``I was a little disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Blake's disappointment turned to relief Wednesday, when Gov. Gary Locke
presented him with a check for $3,300, raised by agency employees and other
state workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're very, very sorry. That should never have happened,'' Locke told
Blake, adding that state employees across Washington felt outrage and sadness
when they heard Blake's story.
</P>
<P>
	   Social worker Michael Butler, 37, of Centralia was fired after an
investigation and charged with first-degree theft. His trial is set for April
18.
</P>
<P>
	   Blake borrowed money from his foster parents to buy the Angus Limousin calf,
which he named ``Wild Thing.'' The cow grew to 1,185 pounds in a few months, and
was awarded ``Grand Champion'' in its type at the fair.
</P>
<P>
	   The check he received from the state workers will be deposited into an
account he will be able to use when he turns 18. The governor also gave Blake, a
budding artist, a kit of art supplies.

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Official Eyes Nuke Security  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Safeguards against espionage at nuclear weapons labs have
improved, but there are still shortcomings that could take years to overcome,
including a willingness by scientists to take polygraph tests, a veteran
spy-catcher told a House intelligence panel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee had asked Paul Redmond, the former head of counterintelligence
at the CIA, to conduct an in-depth review of actions taken by the Energy
Department during the past 18 months to improve counterespionage activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Redmond, widely viewed in the intelligence community as one of the country's
premier spy catchers, gave Energy Secretary Bill Richardson good marks for
tackling the problems since allegations of Chinese espionage erupted at the Los
Alamos weapons lab early last year, but he called the improvements inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the Energy Department ``has failed to gain even a modicum of
acceptance for the polygraph program in the laboratories,'' said Redmond, now
retired, in a summary of his review. And he said attempts at ``awareness
training'' for lab scientists on the potential threats posed by espionage ``have
failed dismally.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he said he saw no problem with Richardson's decision to reduce to about
800 the number of lab workers and scientists subject to polygraph tests, from an
original testing program that was supposed to include more than 10,000. Redmond
said it shows the DOE program is focused on actual security areas.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the department still faces ``a considerable challenge'' in tackling
cyber-security at the labs. ``This will require significant investment in
defense and countermeasures,'' said Redmond in his review, which was requested
by the House Select Committee on Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., committee chairman, said that while it was unusual
for the committee to bring in an outside consultant, the lawmakers wanted an
independent assessment of improvements and continuing problems in
counterintelligence programs at the three weapons labs -- Sandia, Los Alamos and
Lawrence Livermore -- and within the Energy Department's nuclear weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   An unclassified report by Redmond was to be released at a later date.
</P>
<P>
	   Goss emphasized that the review was not intended to focus on alleged Chinese
espionage or the case of former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee, who was
arrested in December and charged with security violations. Lee, accused of
mishandling secret computer codes and copying some of them, awaits trial. He has
denied providing secret information to anyone.
</P>
<P>
	   Redmond gave high praise to Ed Curran, the veteran FBI counterintelligence
expert hired by Richardson to head his anti-espionage office. Curran is making
progress ``but has a long way to go,'' Redmond told the panel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem (of strengthening counterintelligence activities) is massive
and it's just beginning,'' Redmond said to after the hearing. ``They're going
about it the right way.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he suggested that Richardson overstated the improvements in a security
review last month. At the time, Richardson said security at the department and
its labs had improved ``dramatically,'' and in an interview said it should not
be an issue in Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some of the hyperbole was nonsense,'' said Redmond, when asked about
Richardson's assessment.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Redmond said he agreed with Richardson's decision to give
Curran a dual job as head of counterintelligence for the department as well as
for a new, semi-independent nuclear weapons agency within the DOE. This
so-called ``dual hating'' has been criticized by some Republican lawmakers as an
attempt to reduce the new agency's independence.
</P>
<P>
	   In another area, Redmond said the ``shock therapy'' of suspending the
foreign visitors programs at national labs was beneficial because it made
officials ``realize the degree to which these programs, if not properly managed,
can be a counterintelligence threat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson has defended the program and said it should not be interrupted if
the federal labs are to attract the best scientists and do world-class research.
He has said the visitor program has never shown to be linked to attempted
espionage.

<HEADLINE> Officials find no easy answers for oil price spike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BOSTON (AP) - Discussing everything from low oil production quotas in
the Middle East to possible shady backroom speculators, government and industry
officials gathered on Wednesday to grapple with this winter's sharp increase in
heating oil prices.
<P>
	   While everyone was able to agree that the marked increase in prices was
placing many people in dire financial straits, no sure-fire plan emerged that
would settle the volatility in the oil market.
</P>
<P>
	   "All of the Northeast states are in the same predicament," said
Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci. "Some of our most vulnerable citizens, the
elderly and low-income families, are choosing between eating and heating."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson admitted that federal regulators
failed to anticipate that the Northeast would be caught with too small a supply
of oil, causing a rapid increase in heating oil and diesel prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is obvious that the federal government was not prepared. We were caught
napping," he said. "We got complacent."
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson met with a panel of about two dozen people in Boston's historic
Faneuil Hall for a summit on the cause of the oil price spike and to try to
figure out how to prevent future spikes.
</P>
<P>
	   Several dozen truckers drove their rigs to the meeting to demand government
assistance in dealing with the increase in diesel prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you need a pair of tires you're not going to have money to buy tires. If
you need brakes you don't have the money," said trucker Ron Doane, 47, of
Arlington. "It's going to cause accidents."
</P>
<P>
	   A few hours after the summit, President Clinton announced the release of
$125 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help
residents of dozens of states pay for heating oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston meeting came in the wake of a cold snap that when combined with
low oil stocks, drove heating oil prices above $2 a gallon in parts of the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Jay Hakes, head of the federal Energy Information Administration, noted that
heating oil prices have begun dropping, and he said new imports are expected
that will drive them down further.
</P>
<P>
	   While millions of dollars have been released to help people pay for
high-priced oil, and while the Coast Guard has been deployed to clear ice from
rivers to let oil barges through, many of the panelists demanded that the
federal government take steps to insure the Northeast does not face similar
shortages in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bob Weygand, D-R.I., demanded an investigation into whether there had
been price gouging.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Massachusetts Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy, who now runs a nonprofit
company that sells discounted oil to low-income people, was among the most
vociferous supporters of a proposal to mandate that the oil industry be required
to keep a minimum level of inventory on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you allow the supply to get this low without any federal regulation,
you're in trouble," Kennedy said. "It's just simple economics. It's what you
learned in the eighth grade."
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen mentioned the possibility of establishing
a regional oil reserve that could be drawn upon to alleviate price spikes. A
bill sponsored by Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., would establish a 6.7 million
gallon heating oil reserve that the president could draw upon when fuel prices
skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richardson said he was reluctant to endorse any idea that would have the
government get involved in the regulation of oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am leery of putting forth federal standards," he said. "I am worried
about intervening in markets."
</P>
<P>
	   There was concern on the panel that continued volatility in oil markets
could drive up gasoline prices this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Energy Information Administration, 38 percent of
Northeastern homes are heated with oil.
</P>
<P>
	   There was widespread agreement that cuts in production quotas by the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had contributed to the price
hikes, and Richardson said he planned to begin a fresh round of negotiations in
hopes of seeing an increase in production.
</P>
<P>
	   He also announced that the Energy Department will study ways to reduce
reliance on heating oil, and he said the Transportation Department would launch
a three-year study of regulatory waivers that would let truck drivers increase
the amount of oil they delivered. In addition, he urged homeowners to improve
the insulation in their homes, and he announced a $3.8 million grant to help
Massachusetts homeowners weatherize their houses.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton says she's got no interest in being president  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday that she expects
to win the Senate race but that she has no interest in using that position to
run for president.
<P>
	   "I really want to be the senator, and I want to serve my full six-year term,
and I have learned that senators have a whole lot more privacy than presidents,"
she said in an interview with Charlie Rose at the 92nd St. Y. "It is not a
choice I'm looking at, interested in -- I want to be the very best senator I can
be."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Rose asked her what she would do if she lost the race against her
Republican rival, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, I am going to win," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rose also asked her if part of her ups and downs in the White House was due
to the public's unwillingness to accept a strong first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's a problem with the role of first lady," she said. "It's not a
job. It's a role, which people mold to their desires and interests, which I
think is appropriate, and someday the first man will have the same options."
</P>
<P>
	   Rose tried to get Clinton to explain her much-discussed baseball
allegiances. After getting her to read a question submitted in writing by a
member of the audience that read simply "Yankees or Mets?" Rose said: "You can't
be both. It's not allowable."
</P>
<P>
	   "The last time I tried to explain that to New Yorkers I got in so much
trouble, I've actually given up," replied Clinton, who grew up in a Chicago
suburb. "I can't convince anybody that I cared about the Yankees so I don't want
to go there."
</P>
<P>
	   Rose teased her about the line "I make a mean tossed salad," which she used
in the video about her that was shown when she formally announced her candidacy.
She also said in the video that she makes a good omelet.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought that was a clear way of saying I can't cook," she explained. "I
can tear lettuce and I can break eggs."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was invited to speak at the Y to mark the dedication of the Lillian
&AMP; Sol Goldman Family Center for Youth &AMP; Family. The Goldman family - which runs
a Manhattan-based firm, Sol Goldman Investments - gave $5 million to support the
Y's programs for children and parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Tickets to the sold-out event ranged from $20 to $100 and proceeds go to the
Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has accepted an invitation to appear at the Y on May
18. Details of whether it will be an interview, a town meeting or some other
format are still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
	   The 92nd Street Y is nonpartisan and has long been a popular stop for
politicians. Eleanor Roosevelt lectured there in her day, and Bill Bradley
rented space there last fall to announce that his presidential campaign was
being endorsed by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Vice President Al Gore attended
a Hanukkah menorah lighting in December, and Republican presidential contender
Sen. John McCain recently talked about his book, "Faith of My Fathers," as part
of the Y's interview series.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen Thursday morning after a
U.S. ratings agency's placed Japan's yen-denominated bonds on review. Tokyo
share prices rose.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 109.51 yen at late morning, up 0.51 yen from late
Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 109.39 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which was down some 70 points
early in the session, gained 83.79 points, or 0.43 percent, to 19,682.97 at the
end of the morning session. On Wednesday, the average closed up 231.55 points,
or 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In foreign exchange, the dollar moved higher against the yen after Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said Thursday it has placed on review for possible
downgrade Aa1-rated yen-denominated domestic bonds issued or guaranteed by
Japan's government.
</P>
<P>
	   "The review is prompted by structural problems in Japan's economy that have
resulted in a level of public sector debt that will soon be the highest,
relative to GDP, among the advanced industrial economies," Moody's said.
</P>
<P>
	   It said given the scale of Japan's fiscal imbalance, meaningful fiscal
correction might jeopardize the nation's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 108.27 yen, up from 106.98 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices started weak following a drop on Wall Street,
but moved into positive territory on buying of high-technology issues and some
precision instrument makers. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
156.68 points, or 1.5 percent, to 10,561.41 at Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 16.79 points, or 0.99 percent, to 1,707.91. The TOPIX closed up
0.98 points, or 0.96 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8500
percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7950 percent. Its price fell 0.46 point to
98.72.

   YUMA, Ariz. (AP) -- An Air Force F-16 crashed Wednesday during a training
mission over the Barry M. Goldwater bombing range in southwestern Arizona. The
pilot ejected safely.
</P>
<P>
	   The F-16, out of Luke Air Force Base, was flying an air-to-air training
mission as part of a four-jet formation. Before the start of an aerial
engagement, the pilot, Maj. Anthony Barrell, said he had a problem and turned
the jet toward the Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field to recover, a base
spokesman said. He ejected en route to Gila Bend.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the crash was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the eighth crash since fall 1998 involving a jet flying a mission out
of the base in Glendale, west of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> LA Police Chief Decries 4 Officers  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT JABLON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At least four of 12 officers involved in a police
corruption investigation never should have been hired because they had been
arrested or had outstanding debts, Chief Bernard C. Parks said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Park's criticism of departmental hiring came as prosecutors announced they
were going to court Thursday to ask that convictions of nine more defendants be
voided. The cases were compromised by false or planted evidence, the district
attorney's office said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 30 convictions already have been overturned as a result of the
corruption probe. Parks said 99 defendants in 57 cases involving former Officer
Rafael Perez may have been framed through perjury or false arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, the four officers were disqualified but they were later hired, in
some cases after an appeal, the chief said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were misdemeanor arrests, alcohol ... domestic violence, things like
that,'' or debts that showed an inability to handle their finances, Parks said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those are the kinds of things that are red flags for us as it relates to
how an officer will perform in the future,'' said the chief, who was ordered to
make a public presentation by the City Council on how he is handling the growing
corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez, hoping for leniency when he is sentenced for stealing cocaine from an
evidence locker, claims officers in the Rampart Division near downtown framed
and brutalized people and even shot unarmed suspects. Lawsuits involving such
claims could cost the city $125 million, according to one official estimate.
</P>
<P>
	   Parks said he did not know whether Perez was one of the four officers whose
background checks turned up problems that should have kept them off the force.
Parks did say that one of the four was fired in 1998 for allegedly beating a
handcuffed suspect inside the Rampart station.
</P>
<P>
	   A report to be submitted to the civilian Police Commission by March 1 will
call for giving lie detector tests to all police officer candidates, beefing up
the Internal Affairs division and setting up ``sting'' operations to trap bad
cops.
</P>
<P>
	   Parks also told council members that ``telltale signs'' of poor performance
in the Rampart Division were missed by overworked supervisors, and the problem
exists across the department.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 11 officers have been relieved of duty since the corruption scandal
broke last fall. Parks declined to provide a new count.

for the congregation's pastor and his wife, the first victims of the Georgia
tornadoes to be laid to rest. Union Hill Primitive Baptist Church had to set up

Jackie and Mary Ann McClelland, both 64, who were killed Monday when a twister
thrashed their home. "It's difficult to stand here and try to express to you

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton rejected calls for a national
moratorium on capital punishment today but urged the nation's governors to
examine their death penalty systems to make sure that innocent people are not
executed. The idea of a death penalty moratorium has gathered momentum since Ill
Gov. George Ryan took the unprecedented step Jan. 31 of putting all executions
on hold in Illinois, saying that the state's system was "fraught with error."
Clinton said death penalty supporters -- including himself -- are obligated to

emergency session Wednesday to try to avert what they had previously considered
unthinkable: a loss in upcoming parliamentary elections. Stung by the voters'
rejection over the weekend of constitutional changes that would have
strengthened Mugabe's hand, the ruling party's policy-making body tried to
figure out what went wrong and how to prevent a repeat. Zimbabweans' support for
Mugabe, who has ruled the former British colony of Rhodesia since it won
independence in 1980, has plunged along with the country's economy. Inflation

Tobacco Farmers Sue Cigarette Makers

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tobacco farmers sued cigarette makers today for $69
billion, contending they conspired to undo the federal system that regulates
tobacco prices. The class-action case argues that the companies, led by Philip
Morris Inc., misled farmers into helping them stop congressional legislation in
1998 that would have given growers $28 billion. The companies later reached a
settlement with the states that will provide growers with much less -- $5.15
billion over 12 years. Attorneys general of 14 tobacco-growing states are listed
as coconspirators in the lawsuit along with a Philip Morris lobbyist because of
their role in getting the settlement.

<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Gen. Mohammed Fawzi, a former defense minister who
oversaw the rebuilding of Egypt's army after its defeat in the 1967 Mideast war,
died Wednesday. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   Egypt's then-President Gamal Abdel Nasser named Fawzi commander of the army
after the 1967 war, in which Israeli forces captured the Sinai peninsula from
Egypt and secured a cease-fire from the Arab armies in just six days. Fawzi's
No. 1 task was to rebuild and restore confidence in the shattered army.
</P>
<P>
	   The next year, Nasser appointed Fawzi to the Cabinet as defense minister,
and he supervised the so-called war of attrition against Israeli forces along
the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1971 Nasser's successor, President Anwar Sadat, fired and arrested Fawzi,
accusing him of taking part in a coup plot.

writing books on military affairs. He also joined the opposition Arab Nasserite
Democratic Party and became a member of its political bureau.

	   Litkei composed several marches -- including ``The President Lyndon Baines
Johnson March'' and ``The George Bush March'' -- that were played at
presidential inaugural ceremonies.
</P>
<P>

the interactive television program ``Winky Dink and You,'' died Feb. 5. He was
79.
</P>
<P>
	   The program, which initially aired in 1954, was television's first attempt
at interactive broadcasting, and spawned from Prichett's idea of turning the TV
set into a toy and teaching aid for children. The title character Winky would
embark on adventures with his dog, Woofer. Winky usually ran into trouble and
asked children to draw something on the screen, like a bridge over a river. The
program ran for four years on CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   The show returned, with 65 color cartoons, and ran in syndication from 1969
to 1973. It was revived again in the 1990s as a video kit featuring newly
digitized cartoons and new hosts.
Karsten Solheim
</P>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Karsten Solheim, who invented a putter with a ``Ping'' that
led him to establish one of the most successful golf equipment companies, died
Wednesday of complications from Parkinson's disease. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
	   The founder of Karsten Manufacturing Corp. and the creator of the Ping golf
clubs, Solheim was the first to develop perimeter-weight irons, and his popular
brand of putters have been used to win more than 1,800 professional events
around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Solheim stepped down as president and CEO of Karsten Manufacturing in 1995
and was succeeded by his son. He had been confined to a wheelchair in recent
years because of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the innovations in today's irons and putters were developed by
Solheim, a native of Norway who left his job as a mechanical engineer with
General Electric not long after he designed his first putter in 1959.
</P>
<P>
	   Among his numerous honors, Solheim in 1996 received the Ernie Sabayrac Award
from the PGA of America for lifetime contributions to the golf industry.

<P>
	   WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Purdue held off Iowa 67-59 Wednesday night and
the 25th-ranked Boilermakers were in no mood to celebrate after their fifth
straight victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was definitely a unique game," said Brian Cardinal, who led the
Boilermakers with 18 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we're going to battle ... we're going to have to win ugly games like we
did tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams had more turnovers than field goals and Purdue scored its final
13 points on free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boilermakers (18-7, 9-3 Big Ten) had 22 turnovers and 21 field goals.
Iowa (11-13, 4-8) had a season-high 23 turnovers and only 19 field goals while
shooting 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our kids played hard, but it's the second game in a row that we turned the
ball over at a high clip," Iowa coach Steve Alford said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Robinson and Rodney Smith each had 11 points for the Boilermakers who
moved into second place in the league, one-half game behind two-time defending
champion Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacob Jaacks led the Hawkeyes with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a great player. He showed everybody in the Big Ten that he's a tough
player," Cardinal said of Jaacks. "He presents a lot of challenges. He can shoot
and he can be big and strong inside."
</P>
<P>
	   Purdue was protecting a 54-53 lead when Carson Cunningham was fouled
attempting a 3-pointer with 3:04 left. He made all three free throws and the
Boilermakers led 60-53 when Smith made two free throws with 58 seconds remaining
as Jaacks fouled out.
</P>
<P>
	   Two free throws by Chad Kerkhof gave Purdue a 62-53 lead with 38 seconds to
go. Iowa made it 63-59 on a 3-pointer by Dean Oliver with 25 seconds remaining
and Purdue closed the scoring as Cardinal made three free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   Purdue outrebounded the Hawkeyes 34-23 and outscored them from the free
throw line 21-12.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith hit two 3-pointers early in the second half to tie the game at 34.
Reserve Adam Wetzel then scored Purdue's next five points to end an 8-1 run as
Iowa went more than three minutes without a field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   "Adam had to step up," Smith said of the 6-foot-9 freshman. "He worked and
he took it to the hole. He and Kenny (Lowe) gave us a spark. They were
instrumental for us."
</P>
<P>
	   The Hawkeyes came back to tie the game for the final time on a 3-pointer by
Robinson and Purdue then moved ahead to stay with nine consecutive points.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson began the run with 11:22 to play and Cardinal followed with a
3-pointer and then came baskets by Robinson and Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
	   Oliver had 11 points for Iowa, while Griffin added 10, including three
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hawkeyes held Jaraan Cornell, No. 16 on Purdue's career scoring list
with 1,503 points, scoreless as he missed all five of his shots.
</P>
<P>
	   "Jaraan is such an unselfish player," Cardinal said of his teammate, who led
the Boilermakers with a season-high six assists. "When he is not shooting very
well, he is distributing it more and he plays pretty good defense. I think we
have enough scorers on the ball club."
</P>
<P>
	   Purdue had defeated the Hawkeyes 84-58 on Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   "You knew they weren't going to play the same as they did up there
defensively," Purdue coach Gene Keady said. "We hoped we would take better care
of the basketball."

    DALLAS (AP) -- Mike Modano scored twice and rookie Manny Fernandez stopped
18 shots for his first career shutout as the Dallas Stars beat the Nashville
Predators 3-0 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Modano scored 77 seconds after the opening faceoff, converting Jamie
Langenbrunner's backhand pass with an angled shot from the right of goaltender
Tomas Vokoun.
</P>
<P>
	   Modano added his 24th of the season on a wrist shot from the slot with 4:22
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Keane scored his seventh of the season with 1:27 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Fernandez, giving Stars' No. 1 goaltender Ed Belfour a night off, raised his
record to 8-5-1 with the help of Dallas penalty killers who survived six
Nashville power plays.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars continued their defensive dominance, having allowed two goals or
less in 13 of their last 17 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas is 9-2 over its last 11 games. Nashville lost its fifth in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Nashville held an 8-3 shots-on-goal advantage in the second period as
Dallas' penalty killers shut down three power plays.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas withstood a two-man deficit for 47 seconds early in the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars played without Derian Hatcher, Joe Nieuwendyk, Jere Lehtinen,
Brian Skrudland and Shawn Chambers, all sidelined by injuries. Hatcher is

<TEXT>
<P>
    ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- John Amaechi and the Orlando Magic made quick work of
the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
	   Amaechi scored 13 points in the first quarter in Orlando's 129-96 victory
over Los Angeles on Wednesday night. He is averaging 11.7 points in the first
quarter of Orlando's last three games.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a first-quarter terror right now," Magic coach Doc Rivers said. "We're
going to keep going to him obviously. What I like is the way he's scoring. He's
everywhere: He's scoring on the post, he's scoring with jump shots, he's scoring
with drives."
</P>
<P>
	   Amaechi, who finished with 23 points on 10-of-15 shooting, has emerged
following a Feb. 1 trade with Denver that brought Ron Mercer to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
	   "With the addition of Ron, people don't double team, whether it's because
I'm not worthy or because we have good shooters on the outside," Amaechi said.
"Either way, that helps me."
</P>
<P>
	   Every Orlando player scored in the Magic's highest-scoring game since Nov.
11, 1995. Orlando has won five straight, while Los Angeles has lost 18 of its
last 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando had six players reach double figures, with Darrell Armstrong scoring
a game-high 26, Ron Mercer 17, Pat Garrity 15, Corey Maggette 14 and Monty
Williams 10. Bo Outlaw added eight points, eight assists and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando shot 55.4 percent, while Los Angeles shot 40.2 percent and made only
five of 17 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers are 11-40.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're the Clippers," Derek Anderson said. "I don't know if it's a curse or
what. All this talent and it just can't work."
</P>
<P>
	   Maurice Taylor led Los Angeles with 19 points, and Eric Piatkowski and
Tyrone Nesby each had 13. Rookie Lamar Odom added 12 points before fouling out
with 4:55 remaining. Michael Olowokandi had a double-double with 10 points and
15 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The closest Los Angeles came in the second half was when it trailed 73-56
following Piatkowski's layup with 8:29 remaining in the third quarter. But the
Magic went on a 26-13 run, capped by Garrity's 3-pointer, to take a 99-69 lead.
Orlando led by as many as 39 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Nesby blamed the loss on defense and lack of team chemistry.
</P>
<P>
	   "We couldn't play defense at all," Nesby said. "We let one guy throw it up
the court and they score over and over again. No guys getting back and then it
got to the point where everybody's pointing fingers at everybody else.
</P>
<P>
	   "We got to get organized. That's the only way we're going to win is to get
organized."
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando led 65-48 at the half, after leading by 21 in the first half.
Orlando finished the second quarter on a 23-12 run.

    CHICAGO (AP) -- Rob Blake had a goal and two assists Wednesday night to lead
Los Angeles to its fourth straight win, 4-1 over the Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
	   Luc Robitaille, Bryan Smolinski and Glen Murray also scored for the Kings,
who have won six of seven.
</P>
<P>
	   With his 546th career goal, Robitaille stretched his goal-scoring streak to
three games. He has nine goals and eight assists in 11 contests.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago's Tony Amonte scored a short-handed breakaway goal at 7:05 of the
third, ruining Jamie Storr's bid for his second shutout this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blackhawks, 1-3-1 in their last five games, have lost 11 of 12 to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago goalie Steve Passmore played in his first game since Jan. 13 and for
only the third time in the Blackhawks' last 27 contests. Jocelyn Thibault didn't
start because of a sore shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kings outshot the Blackhawks 15-5 in the first period, but didn't score
until Smolinski's goal from the left circle with 1:46 left in the frame.
</P>
<P>
	   Set up by a long lead pass from Ziggy Palffy, Robitaille made it 2-0 during
a Kings power play with 7:48 left in the second. After breaking in, Robitaille
beat Passmore between the legs.
</P>
<P>
	   Blake stretched the Kings' lead to 3-0 just 1:52 later on a high wrist shot
from the top of the right circle.
</P>
<P>
	   Amonte made it 3-1 at 7:05 of the third. After corraling the puck at center
ice, Amonte raced in alone on Storr and forced the Kings goalie to sprawl before
he scored for the fourth time in three games.

<P>
	   Amonte, who leads Chicago with 27 goals, also scored short-handed Monday in

<HEADLINE> Wesley Says Wreck Will Haunt Him  </HEADLINE>
    By JOE MACENKA AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets guard David Wesley said Wednesday
night he expects to be haunted for the rest of his life by the car crash that
killed teammate Bobby Phills.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every day. Every night," Wesley said in his first interview since the Jan.
12 wreck. "From people that I've talked to, they say it doesn't go away. The
pain lessens, but there probably won't be a day that I won't think about it."
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to a group of reporters after the Hornets' 92-85 loss to the Los
Angeles Lakers, Wesley patiently answered questions about an accident that
police say occurred as the two best friends were drag racing.
</P>
<P>
	   Wesley and Phills had just left a shootaround at the Charlotte Coliseum and
were driving their Porsche coupes at speeds in excess of 100 mph when Phills,
driving behind his teammate, lost control of his car. He slid into oncoming
traffic and was struck in the driver's side door, killing him instantly.
</P>
<P>
	   Wesley and the rest of Charlotte's players and coaches stayed at the crash
site for several hours, trying to console each other while waiting for police to
finish their on-scene investigation and extricate Phills' body from his mangled
car.
</P>
<P>
	   Wesley, who has been charged with two misdemeanor traffic offenses, said his
mission now is to try to cope with the heartache of losing someone with whom he
shared so much.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the course of a day, it's going to bring everything back to me," he
said. "Am I going to quit basketball? No. Am I going to stop playing golf? No.
Am I going to stop driving my Porsche? No. Those things are all things that are
going to bring it back."
</P>
<P>
	   Wesley said he has made one significant change since the crash. Usually one
of the Hornets' most outgoing players, he has found himself shying away from
fans. Some of them, Wesley said, have showered him with what he described as
less-than-supportive remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, he is signing less autographs and talking to less members of
the public, two practices he hopes to eventually change.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not all fans are for me," he said. "I've had to deal with some different
comments. I don't know if people think it's funny or it's taking my mind off the
game or they're trying to get to me or what."
</P>
<P>
	   At several stages during the interview, Wesley paused, took a deep breath
and exhaled slowly as he gathered his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
	   One such instance came when he talked about the support he has received from
members of Phills' family, including his parents and his widow, Kendall. Phills'
family members have told him they don't blame him for the fatal crash, Wesley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we're just trying to be a big support group for each other,
really," he said.

<HEADLINE> Knicks 93, Timberwolves 89  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- If looks could kill, Allan Houston would have strangled the
rim. That's how evil his gaze was after he missed a pair of free throws with
13.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was shocked to the point I couldn't believe I missed them," said Houston,
who got another chance with 3.9 seconds left and made both free throws to clinch
the New York Knicks' 93-89 victory over Minnesota on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston, an 83 percent free-throw shooter, has shown a tendency this season
to miss foul shots at critical times.
</P>
<P>
	   It happened at least twice in December, at least once in January and again
against the Timberwolves. After missing these two, he turned and gave a nasty
look at the basket.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's become almost a barrier for him now that it's happened four or five
times," coach Jeff Van Gundy said. "It's almost like he got so upset after he
missed the second one that he just went up and knocked the next two in."
</P>
<P>
	   Latrell Sprewell scored 19 points and Houston had 18 to lead five Knicks in
double figures. Kurt Thomas had 16, Patrick Ewing 15 and Charlie Ward 10.
</P>
<P>
	   The Knicks learned after the game that Ward has a non-displaced fracture of
the little finger on his right hand, an injury that will sideline him 3-4 weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Ward injured the finger against Charlotte on Feb. 7. He played three games
after that, scoring 21 against Milwaukee, zero against Toronto and 10 against
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
	   In a game in which they survived an 18-0 run by the Wolves, the Knicks
posted their seventh double-digit comeback victory of the season and won for the
ninth time in their last 10 games at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Garnett had 23 points and 13 rebounds to lead Minnesota, which lost
its fourth straight. The losing streak is the second-longest of the season for
the Wolves, who lost eight in a row in early- and mid-December.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to stop the bleeding somewhere," Garnett said. "These upcoming
games at home are very crucial now."
</P>
<P>
	   The Timberwolves also were hurt by a pair of missed foul shots, theirs
coming from Joe Smith with 42.8 seconds left to leave them trailing 89-87.
Houston missed a jumper but Larry Johnson grabbed the offensive rebound, forcing
Minnesota to foul. Sprewell hit two from the line with 18.5 seconds left, and
Garnett made a pair with 14.6 seconds left to make it 91-89.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston was immediately fouled, and his misses gave Minnesota a chance to go
for the tie or the lead. But Sam Mitchell missed a runner across the lane,
Garnett missed a tip and Houston rebounded and was fouled.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was so thankful that I had another opportunity," Houston said. "That's
all you can ask for. The bottom line is I made the two free throws, so it
canceled out what had happened."
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas contributed some strong defense on Garnett, helping hold him to
5-for-17 shooting. The Timberwolves lost for just the second time in 23 games
when leading or tied heading into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Timberwolves scored the final 12 points of the first half and the first
six of the third quarter to take a 54-43 lead, but the Knicks came right back
with an 8-0 run to keep things close.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas slammed home a missed shot to make it 66-66 entering the fourth
quarter, and New York's reserves put the Knicks in front from there by scoring
11 of the team's next 13 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas twice gave the Knicks a six-point lead, once on a baby hook with 5:56
left and next on a putback of Chris Childs' airball to make it 85-79 with 4:57
left. A three-point play by Mitchell and a pair of foul shots by Garnett made it
a one-point game with 4:15 left, and Garnett hit a jumper to give Minnesota an
86-85 lead -- its first since the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   A jumper by Sprewell, a foul shot by Garnett and a short jumper by Ewing
gave the Knicks an 89-87 lead heading into the final two minutes.

<HEADLINE> Bush Leads McCain in National Polls  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush retains a healthy lead over Sen. John
McCain in the Republican presidential race, but his lead over Democratic
front-runner Al Gore has virtually disappeared, say two national polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, governor of Texas, leads McCain, an Arizona senator, 58 percent to 31
percent in a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll and led McCain by 20 points in a CBS-New
York Times poll. Support for Alan Keyes was in the single digits in both.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democratic race, Gore, the vice president, led Bradley, a former New
Jersey senator, by about 40 points in both polls, a strong position Gore has had
in many polls since beating Bradley in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   And Gore's involvement with President Clinton may be less of a liability
these days. When people with a favorable view of Gore were asked why, they
mentioned his role in the Clinton administration and his experience. Two-thirds
of those polled said they approved of the Clinton administration's policies.
</P>
<P>
	   But those with an unfavorable view of Gore mentioned his ties to the Clinton
administration most often.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush remains at the top of the GOP field, the polls no longer provide
solid evidence of his claim to be the strongest GOP candidate for the November
general election.
</P>
<P>
	   People were evenly divided about whether they had a favorable or unfavorable
feeling about Bush, about a third taking each view. McCain was viewed favorably
by more than 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had a slight edge over Bradley among likely voters in both polls, but
Bush had only a slight lead over Gore in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, and the
two were tied in the CBS-New York Times poll.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain had a big lead over Bradley in both polls and a 16-point lead over
Gore in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
	   After losing in New Hampshire, Bush is now in a close fight with McCain in
South Carolina and Michigan, and trailing in Arizona, according to polls in
those states with primaries in the next few days. McCain has narrowed the gap
with Bush in delegate-rich states like California and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The CBS-New York Times poll indicated that Bush's efforts to paint McCain as
a liberal ally of the Democrats has been unsuccessful, so far. Only one of 10
consider McCain a liberal, about the same number who see Bush that way.
</P>
<P>
	   Both were considered conservative by about a third of the population, and
the remainder saw them as moderate.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the four leading presidential candidates, McCain was seen as the straight
talker in the CBS-Times poll. About half said he's someone who says what he
believes and a third felt he says what people want to hear. People were about
evenly split on Bradley and by a 2-to-1 margin, they felt Gore and Bush say what
people want to hear.
</P>
<P>
	   The polls remain fluid and a survey by the Vanishing Voter Project
illustrates why.
</P>
<P>
	   When Americans were asked which candidate they support at this time, but are
given the option of admitting they haven't picked a candidate yet, the clear
leader is ``no candidate yet.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are seeing in this early stage is a lot of 'top-of-mind
response,'' said Thomas Patterson, co-director of the Vanishing Voter Project,
which is run by the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public
Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The national CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 1,050 adults was taken Monday and
Tuesday and has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points, and plus
or minus 5 percentage points for likely voters. The CBS-New York Times poll of
1,225 adults was taken Saturday through Monday has an error margin of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Kid Gets Money After Alleged Theft  </HEADLINE>
   By REBECCA COOK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- Thirteen-year-old Blake Topping sold his
prize-winning calf at the Gray's Harbor County fair this winter for $1,900 --
money he planned to use for college.
</P>
<P>
	   But prosecutors say the foster child's case worker at the state Department
of Social and Health Services took the money and gambled it away.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was sort of stunned,'' the boy said. ``I was a little disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Blake's disappointment turned to relief Wednesday, when Gov. Gary Locke
presented him with a check for $3,300, raised by agency employees and other
state workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're very, very sorry. That should never have happened,'' Locke told
Blake, adding that state employees across Washington felt outrage and sadness
when they heard Blake's story.
</P>
<P>
	   Social worker Michael Butler, 37, of Centralia was fired after an
investigation and charged with first-degree theft. His trial is set for April
18.
</P>
<P>
	   Blake borrowed money from his foster parents to buy the Angus Limousin calf,
which he named ``Wild Thing.'' The cow grew to 1,185 pounds in a few months, and
was awarded ``Grand Champion'' in its type at the fair.
</P>
<P>
	   The check he received from the state workers will be deposited into an
account he will be able to use when he turns 18. The governor also gave Blake, a
budding artist, a kit of art supplies.

<HEADLINE> Polls Indicate Hot GOP Contest  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When letter carrier Bill Wilson of Anderson, S.C., talks
to people on his rounds he hears lots of chatter about the state's GOP primary
from Republicans, independents and Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there will be quite a bit of voting by independents and Democrats,
just from delivering mail and talking to people,'' said Wilson, a Republican.
``Just from walking the streets. I see a lot of McCain and Bush signs in the
yards.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson's perception is backed up by polls that suggest turnout Saturday will
be the highest of any GOP presidential primary held in the state. Polls and
campaign-watchers are finding plenty of enthusiasm for John McCain and an
energized GOP base for George W. Bush -- elements for a hot contest, indeed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are ignited,'' Clemson University political scientist David Woodard
said of core Republicans rallying for Bush. ``They are glowing in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican officials have printed up an additional 400,000 ballots to
be sure they have enough.
</P>
<P>
	   The turnout in the Republican primary in 1996 was 276,000 and a third of the
voters identified themselves as independents or Democrats, according to exit
polls. State GOP director J. Sam Daniels said he expects more than 300,000
voters this time, and possibly many more.
</P>
<P>
	   In polls out Wednesday, Bush had a 2-1 lead or better among Republicans
while McCain held a slightly bigger margin among independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain were in a dead heat in a Los Angeles Times poll out early
this week in which 45 percent of the respondents were non-Republicans. In polls
with a smaller sampling of non-Republicans -- 40 percent -- Bush has held a slim
lead or been in a dead heat with McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them, a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll had Bush slightly ahead and a Zogby
poll had them essentially tied.
</P>
<P>
	   An American Research Group poll of 600 likely voters gave Bush 47 percent
and McCain 41 percent, with 7 percent undecided. The poll, also with 40 percent
non-Republicans, was taken Sunday through Tuesday and had an error margin of
plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   A Mason-Dixon poll done for media outlets in South Carolina had the race
essentially tied, Bush with 45 percent and McCain with 42 percent with a 4 point
error margin.
</P>
<P>
	   The third candidate in the race, Alan Keyes, has been in single digits.
</P>
<P>
	   Woodard, co-director of the Palmetto Poll, said a question for McCain is
whether all the enthusiasm for him outside his party will be expressed in a
strong turnout on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather could be a big factor, he said, because McCain needs a high
turnout from those less accustomed to voting in a GOP primary. If it rains
Saturday, ``then God wants George Bush'' to win, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   While many non-Republicans are expected to vote, some say the negative turn
of the campaign has cooled their enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
	   Shirley Walker, a 64-year-old Democrat and foster mother from Walterboro
downstate, is still considering whether to vote and admits to being bothered by
the campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If a person is capable and honest, they shouldn't have to do that if they
run for president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative Republican enthusiasm for Bush has grown along with that of
moderates, independents and some Democrats for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a little concerned about the crossover Democrats trying to influence
the election,'' said salesman Guy Stanley Orr of Simpsonville.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the campaign first started, I wasn't sure how I felt about Bush,''
Orr said. ``But as I listened to him, he has answered all the questions I have
at this time.''

<HEADLINE> No.14 Iowa St. 64, No.24 Kansas 62  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG TUCKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Jamaal Tinsley stole the ball and drove the length of
the court for layups twice over the final 1:40, lifting No. 14 Iowa State to a
64-62 victory over No. 24 Kansas on Wednesday night and breaking the Cyclones'
17-game losing streak in Allen Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Marcus Fizer hit an off-balance jumper with 6 seconds left for a 63-59 lead
for the Cyclones (22-3, 10-1 Big 12), who hadn't won at Kansas since 1982. Then
Kansas' Jeff Boschee, suffering through a miserable shooting night, made a
3-pointer with 1.5 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Shirley hit a free throw in the final second to clinch the win and give
the streaking Cyclones their first road victory over a ranked opponent since
1987.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cyclones, who have won 19 of their last 20, took over first place in the
league, one game ahead of Oklahoma State and Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas (18-7, 7-4) took a 59-53 lead with 3:06 to play when Boschee, who was
just 2-for-17 from the field, hit two free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   But then Tinsley made his two big plays, Shirley scored from inside and
Michael Nurse hit a jumper to quiet the capacity crowd and give Iowa State a
61-59 lead with 1:11 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Fizer finished with 15 points and Tinsley, Shirley and Nurse all had 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Bradford and Drew Gooden each had 11 points for Kansas.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the second half, Gooden scored seven points in a 13-5 run as Kansas
took a 48-37 lead and seemed en route to its 14th straight home win.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas, a 74-66 loser at Iowa State last month, kept Fizer in check most of
the night with a collapsing defense while Boschee had the worst night of his
career.
</P>
<P>
	   Boschee's first field goal, a long 3-pointer with about 4:30 to play, halted
an Iowa State surge and put the Jayhawks on top 57-48.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradford's three-point play gave Kansas its biggest lead at 48-37 with 11:11
to play. Then a dunk by the muscular 6-foot-8 Fizer ignited an 11-5 run by the
Cyclones.

<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gabe Muoneke scored 17 points, including eight
straight in a key second-half run, to lead No. 17 Texas to a 68-57 victory over
No. 8 Oklahoma State on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas (18-6, 9-2 Big 12) led 40-33 early in the second half when Muoneke
went on his scoring spree, getting all of his points by muscling his way close
to the basket for short jumpers and layups to push the Longhorns' lead to 48-35
with 13:55 left to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma State (20-3, 9-2) cut the lead to 48-44 on a three-point play by
Desmond Mason but got no closer. The Cowboys got within 61-55 on 3-pointer by
Glendon Alexander before Chris Owens hit one of two foul shots for Texas and
Longhorns center Chris Mihm grabbed the miss and brought the crowd of 15,525 to
its feet with a two-handed dunk with 1:58 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Mihm had 15 points and 16 rebounds for Texas, which also got 14 points from
Darren Kelly. Texas shot 47 percent from the field against the Big 12's best
defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Mason, who scored 30 points when Oklahoma State beat Texas 73-65 in January,
finished with 12 on 4-of-13 shooting in the rematch.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the worst free throw shooting teams in the Big 12, Texas was 7-of-10
from the line over the final four minutes to help preserve its lead. The
Longhorns also outrebounded the Cowboys 39-25. OSU had just seven offensive
boards.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma State held the biggest lead of the first half at 17-12 before Texas
used a 7-2 run sparked by Kelly's 3-pointer to tie it at 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Gottlieb hit a short jumper to put OSU up 24-23 before Ivan Wagner
closed the first half with two 3-pointers over the final 1:51 as Texas took a
29-27 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Mason picked up two fouls in the opening 10 minutes and was just 1-of-3
shooting for three points in the first half.

<HEADLINE> Former Dallas Coach Landry Buried  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRISTY LEMIRE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- F-16s and World War II AT-6 fighter trainers flew overhead
and Pro Football Hall of Famers sat in mourning Wednesday as former Dallas
Cowboys coach Tom Landry was laid to rest in a private ceremony.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing of the funeral was not made public at the request of Landry's
wife, Alicia. Landry died Saturday at age 75 after suffering from leukemia for
nine months.
</P>
<P>
	   The guest list of about 400 friends and family members included former
Cowboys Tony Dorsett, Roger Staubach, Harvey Martin and Dan Reeves. Frank
Gifford, a teammate of Landry's on the New York Giants, also attended.
</P>
<P>
	   Cowboys chaplain John Weber gave about a 20 minute eulogy at Sparkman
Hillcrest Funeral Home. Afterward, mourners walked to the grave site at nearby
Hillcrest Memorial Park for the burial.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was very upbeat, believe it or not. There were a lot of memories shared,
the professional people all knew one another," said funeral home manager George
Rohrer. "Mrs. Landry got a lot of support and was fairly uplifted by the
occasion."
</P>
<P>
	   The F-16s flew over in a diamond formation, followed by AT-6s in the
"Missing Man" formation, in which four planes fly over and one loops out to
symbolize the dead pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   The AT-6 was the standard pilot trainer during World War II and Landry, who
was a B-17 pilot, likely would have learned to fly in one.
</P>
<P>
	   Landry spent two years as a bomber pilot with the Army Air Corps. He flew 30
combat missions and survived one crash landing.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the jet flyover, Landry received full military honors in the
form of a rifle salute and color guard.
</P>
<P>
	   More memorials and tributes are planned for Thursday. At noon, family and
friends will hold a private memorial service at Highland Park United Methodist
Church, where Landry was a member for 43 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, city leaders have planned a public memorial service at the Morton
H. Meyerson Symphony Center.

    MIAMI (AP) -- Cobi Jones' header in the 59th minute lifted the United States
to a 1-0 victory over Peru in a Gold Cup soccer game Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   American goalie Brad Friedel made two sterling saves in the final 23 minutes
to preserve the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Americans (2-0) secured first place in the Group B bracket and will face
Columbia (1-1) in a quarterfinal match Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Honduras (2-0), a 2-0 winner over Colombia in the first game, will play Peru
(0-1-1) in the other Miami-based quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
	   After a closely marked first half with few scoring opportunities,
left-footer Eddie Lewis passed to Jones, who headed a shot past the arms of
Peruvian goalie Oscar Ibanez. Jones also scored in a 3-0 U.S. victory over Haiti
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the second half, Friedel smothered a point-blank shot from substitute
Ysrael Zuniga in the 67th minute. Seven minutes later, Friedel deflected a
straight-on blast from Abel Lobaton.
</P>
<P>
	   Honduras got second-half goals seven minutes apart from Carlos Pavon and
Milton Nunez to wrap up first place in Group A. Pavon also assisted on Nunez's

<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
	   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Consecutive double-digit conference losses had
Kentucky coach Tubby Smith proclaiming it was time to ease up on the inside game
and increase the tempo a bit.
</P>
<P>
	   But the power game proved to be the only reliable method of scoring
Wednesday night as the 19th-ranked Wildcats held off a late charge to beat
injury-riddled Alabama 66-54.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory snapped a two-game losing streak and moved the Wildcats (18-7,
8-3 Southeastern Conference) into a second-place tie with Florida in the Eastern
Division, one game behind Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamaal Magloire scored 16 points and Tayshaun Prince added 14, most coming
on putbacks or drives, as Kentucky won its 17th straight home game.
</P>
<P>
	   Forwards Jules Camara and Marvin Stone, who both missed practice time this
week because of injuries, helped solidify the interior game, coming off the
bench to combine for 19 points, 13 rebounds and four blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
	   That was a good thing as the Wildcats shot only 41 percent, including a
dismal 2-of-23 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   "We did push and run the ball, we just didn't put points on the scoreboard,"
Smith said. "We certainly did not shoot the ball well tonight, even with open
looks. We shot the ball well in practice, it just didn't carry over.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we're still a little hesitant and not going up smooth. Their zone
gave us some problems and that's something we have to resolve."
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama (11-12, 4-7) shot 32 percent from the field (19-of-59), hitting more
3-point baskets (11) than two-pointers (8). The Crimson Tide made only one of
their first eight shots to open the game and missed their first 10 shots of the
second half, giving the Wildcats a chance to take control of both halves.
</P>
<P>
	   "We put ourselves in a hole," Alabama coach Mark Gottfried said. "In the
first half, we had some turnovers and got into a hurried pace."
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama had been forced because of injuries to play their last two games
with only six scholarship players. Guard Schea Cotton and forward Sam Haginas
returned against the Wildcats but were ineffective, contributing a total of six
points and three rebounds in 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Freshman guard Rod Grizzard picked up the slack, scoring 14 of his game-high
20 points in the second half as the Tide trimmed an 18-point deficit to only
five late in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Grizzard hit 4-of-8 3-pointers and Terrance Meade added 4-of-9 and finished
with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was very impressed with Grizzard and Meade," Smith said. "Both of them
made a lot of 3s. One of the things we were trying to do was defend the 3-point
shot, and we didn't do a very good job."
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama trailed 52-36 with 11:13 to play when Grizzard scored eight points
in a 13-2 run to pull the Tide within 54-49 with 2:57 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a putback by Prince, Kentucky forced a shot-clock violation on
Alabama's next possession. Two free throws by Magloire gave the Wildcats a 58-49
lead with 1:43 to play, and the Tide would get no closer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was proud of our players," Gottfried said. "We kept fighting and got to
where we were shooting fouls shots to cut it to four. We just didn't seem to
have enough."

strength and we were up by 30," junior forward Shane Battier said. "Everything
seemed right with the world."
</P>
<P>
	   The Blue Devils (20-3, 11-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) inched a step closer
to a record-tying fourth straight ACC regular season championship with their
11th consecutive victory over Florida State. Duke, which tied a season high with
12 3-pointers and committed only seven turnovers, can tie for the title with a
win Saturday at North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
	   Duke's five starters were in double figures with 15:55 left as coach Mike
Krzyzewski notched his 15th 20-win season in 20 years with the Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Seminoles (9-13, 4-7) are 1-5 since beating North Carolina in
Chapel Hill on Jan. 22, and have lost seven of their last nine. Nigel Dixon led
Florida State with a season-high 12 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Duke lost in Cameron for the first time since January 1997 -- a span of 46
games -- a week ago to No. 22 Maryland. But the Seminoles ran into a determined
group of Blue Devils who shot 60 percent in the first half and had a 25-0
advantage on points off turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   "No matter where we're playing I think that you've got to be ready to play
and Maryland showed us that," said senior Chris Carrawell, who added 16 points,
six rebounds and six assists. "Just because you are playing at home, that
doesn't mean you're going to win. That's how we approached tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State led the Blue Devils a month ago by two at the half in
Tallahassee, Fla., but had a rough time solving Duke's press this time, coughing
it up 14 times in the opening 20 minutes to trail 53-28 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't take care of the basketball and we had talked about that,"
Florida State coach Steve Robinson said. "If you look at the stat sheet they've
got 33 points off of turnovers. You're not going to win many basketball games if
you give them freebies like that."
</P>
<P>
	   The Seminoles trailed by 10 with 7:49 left in the half before Duke closed
with a 22-7 barrage as Williams scored seven points and James made two
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Nothing seemed to go right for the Seminoles. Twice in the first half Duke
missed foul shots, only to see a long rebound result in 3-pointers by Mike
Dunleavy and James.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blue Devils made their first five shots of the second half to go up by
32 points as Robinson yanked his starters out in disgust. The Cameron Crazies
then pointed to the starters on the bench and the subs on the court and chanted
"Bad team, bad team."
</P>
<P>
	   "When you are behind and you're struggling you've got to do something to try
to shake them up," Robinson said of his starters, who combined for only 25
points. "I'll tell you what, our second unit played better. They were more
aggressive."
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Hale, the fourth-leading scorer in the ACC at 16.6 points a game, had
another miserable game against Duke. He scored two points in the first meeting
and seven this time around as the Seminoles suffered their third worst ACC loss.
</P>
<P>
	   "Defensively, they do a good job and they make it difficult for him,"
Robinson said of his senior, who has never reached double figures against the
Blue Devils. "Those are the reasons he hasn't knocked down some of the shots he
normally knocks down."

<HEADLINE> No. 16 LSU 97, Mississippi 53  </HEADLINE>
    By RALPH D. RUSSO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- It seems that every time LSU takes the court these
days it does something the program hasn't been able to do in years.
</P>
<P>
	   Stromile Swift scored 18 points and Lamont Roland added 17 as No. 16 LSU
cruised to a 97-53 victory over Mississippi on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   LSU (20-4, 7-4 Southeastern Conference) reached 20 wins for the first time
since 1992-93, the last time LSU had a winning record and went to the NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers' turnaround has been arguably the best in the country this
season. LSU was just 12-15 last season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew we would be one of the better teams in the SEC if we came in and
worked hard and did what the coaches told us," Swift said. "The only thing that
could stop us was ourselves."
</P>
<P>
	   The win was LSU's fourth straight and seventh in its last eight games.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Beshara scored 17 points for the Tigers, who shot 62 percent
(31-for-50) from the field and 83 percent (30-for-36) from the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we are peaking at just the right time," Beshara said. "We struggled
early in the SEC, but we corrected ourselves. Hopefully we're peaking. We played
pretty well tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   Playing well away from home is also a huge step for the Tigers. LSU hadn't
won consecutive road games since 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know how to describe it," second-year LSU coach John Brady said.
"It was the best I've ever had a team play, especially on the road."
</P>
<P>
	   LSU snapped an 18-game road losing streak 10 days ago with a 93-60 victory
at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
	   After building a 20-point halftime lead, the Tigers ran away in the second
half as their transition game and size overwhelmed Ole Miss (15-9, 3-8). The
lead was up to 30 in less than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have one of the best frontcourts in the SEC," Swift said of himself,
Beshara and Jabari Smith, LSU's second-leading scorer behind Swift, who had just
four points. "It's hard to match up with us. We're tough to defend."
</P>
<P>
	   LSU substituted freely in the second half, even playing walk-on Brandon
Landry for the final six minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Jermaine Williams scored 10 the 32 points LSU got from its reserves.
</P>
<P>
	   Torris Bright scored 11 points for LSU, including a 3-pointer with 11:19
left that made the lead 69-35.
</P>
<P>
	   Brad Bridgewater hit a short jumper with less than a minute left to give LSU
a 46-point lead, its largest of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Emmanuel Wade had 10 points for the Rebels, who shot 30 percent (19-for-63).
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to give LSU credit," Ole Miss coach Rod Barnes said. "They played
great defense on us. They played like a team hungry for wins."
</P>
<P>
	   LSU also snapped a seven-game losing streak against Ole Miss and a
seven-game skid in Oxford. The Rebels had won nine of the last 11 meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   Swift said the Tigers were motivated by the past failures against Ole Miss,
especially in Oxford, where the Rebels won by 22 last season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We wanted to come in here and prove that we weren't the same team that came
in the past," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, LSU broke a 10-game losing streak to Kentucky with a 70-57 win at
Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the home worst loss for Ole Miss since 1965 when the Rebels lost
96-50 to Tennessee and their worst loss ever at Tad Smith Coliseum, which opened
in 1966.

Internet Racism Concerns U.N.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   GENEVA (AP) -- The United States could do more to curb the use of the
Internet for racist material while upholding freedom of speech, experts said
Wednesday at a U.N. meeting. Speakers noted the legal challenges of controlling
Internet content in, and originating from, the United States, where the First
Amendment of the constitution guarantees freedom of speech. Although the U.S.
government cannot ban racist speech outright, it could impose "reasonable
restrictions," such as requiring a permit that would force publishers to
identify the content of their sites, Swiss-based information technology law
expert David Rosenthal argued.

Reinforcements Arrive in Kosovo
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.N. police reinforcements began
arriving in this ethnically divided town on Wednesday, following two weeks of
violence that left nine people dead and dozens injured. A total of 300 officers
are to be sent to Kosovska Mitrovica, top U.N. administrator Bernard Kouchner
said. With the upsurge in violence, more reinforcements were needed, and not
just in Kosovska Mitrovica, but throughout the province of Kosovo, U.N.
Assistant Secretary-General Hedi Annabi told the Security Council on Wednesday
at the United Nations. A rocket attack on a U.N. bus which killed two Serb
civilians on Feb. 2 sparked the latest round of violence.

Clinton Rejects Death Penalty Moratorium
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton rejected calls for a national
moratorium on capital punishment Wednesday but urged the nation's governors to
examine their death penalty systems to make sure that innocent people are not
executed. The idea of a death penalty moratorium has gathered momentum since Ill
Gov. George Ryan took the unprecedented step Jan. 31 of putting all executions
on hold in Illinois, saying that the state's system was "fraught with error."
Clinton said death penalty supporters -- including himself -- are obligated to
make sure there is no question of guilt for condemned prisoners.

Funerals Held for Tornado Victims

	   PELHAM, Ga. (AP) -- A small Baptist church overflowed Wednesday with
mourners for the congregation's pastor and his wife, the first victims of the
Georgia tornadoes to be laid to rest. Union Hill Primitive Baptist Church had to
set up speakers so friends and relatives outside in the sunlight could hear
tributes to Jackie and Mary Ann McClelland, both 64, who were killed Monday when
a twister thrashed their home. "It's difficult to stand here and try to express
to you that God is a God of love," the Rev. Cleston Brooks told mourners. "But
do not let this harden your heart. It's not for you and I to choose when our
time will come."

China Dissident Gets Six Years
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- A Chinese court has handed a six-year jail term to a
dissident convicted of subversion for his part in organizing a would-be
opposition party, a human rights group said. Liu Shizun, who worked as an
assistant to dissident Xu Wenli, now also in jail, was sentenced Wednesday in
the northeastern city of Dalian, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said Thursday. Liu, 38, is the 21st
leader of the China Democracy Party to be imprisoned on subversion charges since
the government began cracking down on the group in late 1998, the Information
Center said.

Microsoft Tries To Prevent Breakup

	   REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- A lobbyist for Microsoft Corp. peppered lawmakers on
Capitol Hill with e-mails, pushing for a settlement in the company's federal
antitrust case and lambasting the U.S. Department of Justice for discussing the
possibility of a company breakup. In the e-mails, sent Friday by Microsoft
lobbyist Kerry Knott, the company said it was willing to accept a "common sense"
settlement, but accused the Justice Department of fronting for the company's
competitors.
