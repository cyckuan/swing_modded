AS MOVIE EXHIBITORS PUSH TOWARD AN UNCERTAIN ENDING, AMC IS
CONFIDENT 
</HEADLINE>

 BY JENNIFER MANN, THE KANSAS CITY STAR   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the undertakings facing any such company would be
scrutinizing which leases to keep and which ones to reject on
properties it doesn't own.
</P>
<P>
   David Brain is president of Kansas City-based Entertainment
Properties Trust, a real estate investment trust that owns 26
megaplex properties that it leases back to exhibitors. AMC-operated
megaplexes make up 75 percent of its portfolio. Brown of AMC is the
nonemployee chairman of Entertainment Properties Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Brain said that after United Artists files Chapter 11, which he
and many others in the industry expect any day, he thinks the
company ultimately will close 1,000 screens, half of its total.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate wipeout of 1,000 movie screens would allow everyone
else in the industry to breathe just a wee bit easier.
</P>
<P>
   If another exhibitor follows United Artists into Chapter 11 _
and again take hundreds of movie screens out of the mix in one fell
swoop _ it would create even more breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon of Moody's said he thought it would be difficult for an
exhibitor to file for Chapter 11 because the movie distributors
then would probably want their money up front.
</P>
<P>
   But Brain disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``United Artists is essentially in bankruptcy, and they're still
getting film and still conducting day-to-day business,'' Brain
said. ``The studios are not scared to distribute product despite
(United Artists') situation, which is good news for all those who
may follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Brain agrees with Brown that industry analysts are painting the
entire troubled industry with one broad stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a two-part story that's being viewed through a single
lens,'' Brain said. ``You can't take total box office revenues and
divide that by the number of screens and come up with the whole
story; that other part of the story is that some are doing better
than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its current troubles, Brown said AMC is in that pack of
those doing better than others. Others, including Kuzio of KDP,
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMC, in particular, is a company that we're recommending to
our clients,'' Kuzio said. ``We like what they're doing to better
position themselves relative to what others are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of his faith comes in AMC's slowdown of capital spending
and commitment of more money to taking obsolete screens out of its
mix. Other exhibitors are on that track as well, but AMC is moving
more aggressively than many.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, last year AMC recorded $16.7 million in expenses
for theater closures, compared with only $2.8 million the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of its current fiscal year in March 2001, AMC will
have closed almost 750 screens in the previous five years.
Meanwhile, the company will have opened 1,900 screens in new
megaplexes.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, 62 percent of AMC's screens are at megaplexes, the
highest percentage in the industry and one that has increased each
quarter since it opened its first, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves 38 percent of its screens in smaller multiplexes.
But not all of those are obsolete, Brown said. He puts the
percentage at somewhere around 14 percent, which equals about 400
screens. Those, he said, will be taken out of the mix over the next
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than thinking of his mentor, Durwood, as the pioneer of
overbuilding, Brown prefers to think of him as the one who really
got the ball rolling in shifting the industry to what it will look
like in three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty darn clean portfolio of better-performing
theaters than, I'd say, a good 80 percent of the industry,'' Brown
said. ``Some would call that first-mover advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   During the more than 70 years that AMC has been in business, it
has teetered a few times itself, including in the late 1980s, when
international expansion almost brought the company to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he takes some comfort in the fact that the company
has been through the valley before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tended to change the industry a time or two, and we've
had challenges. And not to sound cocky, but I take comfort in
that,'' Brown said. ``There's a lot of drama on Wall Street right
now regarding this industry, but for us it's sort of background
noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a recent report from Banc of America Securities on
AMC in which analyst Christopher Harris dubbed AMC a ``probable
survivor'' in the exhibition industry, Brown bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should even have to say those two words:
probable survivor,'' Brown said. ``We're most definitely a
survivor. ... I really think our story will have a strong ending.''

TOP-SEEDED AGASSI DROPS OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Top-seeded Andre Agassi has dropped out of this
week's Mercedes-Benz Cup because of a back injury, he announced
Monday at UCLA's L.A. Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi was rear-ended in his car in Las Vegas on July 9 _ two
days after reaching the Wimbeldon semifinals _ and hasn't
recovered. He practiced for 40 minutes Sunday but said his back
stiffened overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing here, but it feels like someone kicked me in
the back,'' Agassi said. ``I was looking forward to coming back and
had high hopes, but I'm just not ready yet. My first priority is to
get 100 percent healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, 30, is ranked No.2 in the world. He won the
Mercedes-Benz Cup in 1998. On Friday he dropped out of Monday's
charity set _ with Michael Chang, Dennis Miller, Dustin Hoffman,
Marcelo Rios and Mark Philippoussis _ but was hoping to be ready
for tonight's first-round matchup with 19-year-old Taylor Dent.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning he telephoned tournament director Bob Kramer
and formally requested a Wednesday start instead of tonight.
Otherwise, Agassi said, he couldn't play.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said he told Agassi that wasn't possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' Kramer said. ``Andre's the No.1
seed, and we're sorry he's not able to play. We know a lot of
people like to watch Andre Agassi and he's got a lot of fans in
L.A., so it's a little disappointing. I'm sure (not having Agassi)
is going to have an effect, but ticket sales are already ahead of
last year by about 30 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi said he originally didn't think the injury was serious _
he said a ``friendly neighbor'' collided with Agassi's car at about
20 mph _ but Agassi's condition worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The accident) really didn't seem like much. I was more
startled than anything,'' said Agassi, who said there was $11,000
damage to his car. ``I knew my neighbor who hit me. He's a friendly
neighbor, so it was just a coincidence. ... He's incredibly
embarrassed, he felt horrible and he still feels horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi said he underwent an MRI, which showed no structural
damage. He said he had two injections and took anti-inflammatory
medicine and painkillers. He also tried massages and rest, but when
he was awakened early Monday with a back spasm and was still sore
later in the morning, he decided there was no way he could be ready
by today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre just didn't respond to treatment,'' said Dr. Domenick
Sisto, the tournament physician. ``He's still very tight and tender
in that area and he's in consistent pain. It's best that he doesn't
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, 30, won his sixth Grand Slam title in January. Last year
he won his second U.S. Open and the French Open. He's amassed 45
career ATP career singles titles and almost $20 million in prize
money.
</P>
<P>
   After Agassi, the top seeds, in order, are Philippoussis, Rios,
Chang and Wayne Ferreira.

FEWER FIRST-DAY DOWNLOADS THAN EXPECTED FOR KING'S ONLINE NOVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite top; picks up at 3rd graf. Describes DeFillippo's
job in 4th graf.)  
 By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Demand for horror writer Stephen King's new electronic book fell
short of expectations Monday, in a closely watched test of the
author's attempt to transform book sales over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for the book fell short of King's last novella in
March, which seemed to foretell a revolution in publishing when
more than 400,000 fans jammed computer servers trying to download
it in the first two days after it appeared.
</P>
<P>
   King's Web site operators had planned to handle similar demand
Monday, just in case. But as of late Monday afternoon, fans had
downloaded 41,000 copies of the first chapter of ``The Plant,'' an
epistolary novel about the predations of a vicious vine. King plans
to publish the novel in monthly installments.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difference may be that this time King elected to
publish the book without the support of a publisher, relying
entirely on the Internet and word-of-mouth to attract readers. ``We
didn't have the marketing and sales promotion that Simon &AMP; Schuster
put behind `Riding the Bullet,' and that obviously accounted for
some of the difference,'' said Marsha DeFillippo, an assistant to
King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riding the Bullet'' is the novella that King published in
electronic form.
</P>
<P>
   King's promotion of the project consisted entirely of two
advertisements, one in Publishers Weekly and another in USA Today,
as well as a morning television appearance and a few newspaper
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   King was ``very pleased'' with sales for far, DeFillippo said,
calling the first-day sales respectable. King's Web site designers
prepared for as many as half a million downloads, just in case. But
others in the industry said 40,000 was an impressive total for one
day's sales of an electronic book, for which there are few
benchmarks for comparison.
</P>
<P>
   King may have thrown off some readers by trying out an
honor-system payment plan. King asked readers to pay him a dollar
for each chapter they downloaded, and warned that he would not post
new installments unless he received payments for at least 75
percent of the downloads.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com agreed to handle the payments, and said that by late
Monday afternoon it had received about 25,000 credit card payments
for the first chapter, and that another 7,000 customers had
promised to send a check or cash. Amazon.com had distributed
``Riding the Bullet'' for free and all in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   King was particularly pleased to see that the number of payments
so far seemed to meet his 75 percent threshold, DeFillippo said.
</P>
<P>
   William Thornton, president of Radiant Ideas, who maintains
www.stephenking.com., said that some visitors to the Web site
objected to the installment plan.
</P>
<P>
   In e-mails and messages posted on the Web site, ``There was
fairly vehement reaction to the idea of paying multiple times for
it,'' Thornton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com's chief executive, said he hoped that the
honor-system model might inspire others to try distributing books
as if they were ``shareware,'' software circulated on the Internet
with payment expected later. ``If you can make it easy for people,
people are going to be willing to pay,'' Bezos said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lorraine Shanley, a principal in the book industry
consulting company Market Partners International, questioned just
how easy it was. She noted it took several clicks to finish the
Amazon.com payments. Then readers will need to come back and pay
for more installments. ``There wasn't instant gratification,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a hint perhaps of battles to come, some other booksellers
questioned King's decision to favor Amazon.com as the exclusive
bill collector. ``It is a shame,'' said Ed Morrow, owner of the
Northshire Bookstore in Manchester Center, Vt., and former
president of the American Booksellers Association. He noted that
King could have elected to send customers for payment to the
association's Booksense Web site or another store's, including his
own. ``We have a Web site, and we could have done it for him,'' he
said.

FERREIRA, CLEMENT HAVE NO TROUBLE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wayne Ferreira and Arnaud Clement, the only seeded
players participating Monday in the Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA's
L.A. Tennis Center, both advanced in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira, of South Africa, who moved from fifth seed to No. 4
following top-seeded Andre Agassi's departure because of a back
injury, knocked off France's Anthony Dupuis 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreria's serves overpowered Dupuis. The South African recorded
just four aces but won 82 percent of his service points.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreria, one of four active ATP players to win titles on all
four surfaces, has 13 career singles titles, the last in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Clement, an established doubles player who's seeking his first
ATP singles title, eliminated South Africa's Marcos Ondruska 6-3,
6-2. He didn't commit a double-fault against Ondruska and won 12 of
15 second-serve points.
</P>
<P>
   __ Snake pit: Agassi isn't the only tennis player suffering from
the injury bug. Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil was forced to withdraw
because of a groin injury. Others ATP competitors who are hurting
include Thomas Enqvist (shoulder), Goran Ivanisevic (knee), Jonas
Bjorkman (back) and Kenneth Carlsen (shoulder).
</P>
<P>
   __ It's a Chang thang: Michael Chang will face Australia's Paul
Kilderry in the marquee matchup at 7:30 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bryan earns berth: Camarillo's Bob Bryan qualified as
wild-card entry after winning last weekend's Prudential Securities
challenger event in Aptos. He earned $7,200 and a match with
Australia's Jason Stoltenberg in the first round of the Mercedes
event.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan, the 1998 NCAA singles champion at Stanford, is also
competing with twin brother Mike in doubles here this week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Slow day: Because of the Davis Cup and European tournaments,
only five singles matches were played Monday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Good mix: The tournament is a good preview for Olympic fans
because the singles draw features 32 players from six continents
and 14 countries _ including six players who are No. 1 in their
country.
</P>
<P>
   __ Oh, to be young again: Ronald Agenor, at 35 the oldest player
in the singles draw, lost to Kevin Ullyett 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-4 in
the first round. Agenor, nicknamed the ``Haitian Sensation,''
surrendered nine aces.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Texas Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriquez, the
reigning American League Most Valuable Player, will miss the rest
of the season after breaking his right thumb in last night's game
against the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, regarded by many as the best all-around catcher in
baseball, began the day batting .347 with 27 home runs and 83 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was hurt in the first inning when his thumb hit the
bat of Anaheim's Mo Vaughn on a swinging third strike as he threw
to second base on a steal attempt by Kevin Stocker.
</P>
<P>
   Home-plate umpire Gerry Davis called Stocker out on batter's
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was taken to a hospital for X-rays, which revealed a
fracture of the metacarpal bone in his right thumb. The Rangers
said he would have surgery today in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as it happened, my thumb went numb. There was swelling
and I knew it was broken and I'd be out for the season,'' Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   The team's director of medical services, Dr. John Conway, said
Rodriguez will need six to 10 weeks for the fracture to heal.
Rodriguez will be able to resume sports-related activities in two
to four months.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said there were no guarantees that Rodriguez would be
able to fully recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime there's an injury like this, there's a possibility for
a loss of performance,'' he said. ``But we think he'll make a full
recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said Vaughn did nothing wrong, and added that the
Angels first baseman left a message in the Rangers clubhouse
expressing his sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was on purpose,'' Rodriguez said. ``Mo is a
very clean player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, AL West champions the past two seasons, began the
night 101/2 games behind division-leading Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 28, played this month in his ninth consecutive
All-Star game. He received more votes than any other player in the
fans' All-Star balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having a strong season so it's disappointing for it to
end two months before it was supposed to,'' Rodriguez said. ``But
there's always next season. I'll just go out and put up better
numbers next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has won eight consecutive Gold Glove awards, an
American League record. This year, he had thrown out 16 of 33 (48.5
percent) would-be base stealers. Last year, he caught 54.2 percent,
the fifth consecutive season that he led the AL in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez won the MVP award last year when he hit .332 with an
AL-record 35 home runs by a catcher. He had 113 RBIs and scored 116
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was replaced in last night's game by veteran Bill
Haselman, who is hitting .250 with five RBIs in 18 games this
season. Haselman is the only other catcher currently on the
Rangers' roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers purchased the contract of catcher B.J. Waszgis from
Triple-A Oklahoma. Rodriguez will be placed on the 15-day disabled
list today.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said Rodriguez's
season-ending injury, coupled with the loss of highly touted rookie
center fielder Ruben Mateo to a broken right leg on June 2, seemed
to sum up his team's season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day,'' Melvin said. ``We always take Pudge for
granted that he's always going to be out there. But you have to
realize it can happen to anybody. You wonder which player your team
can least afford to lose. He falls into that category.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin was unsure whether the loss of Rodriguez would mean his
team would be more willing to trade impending free agents such as
David Segui and John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is still running on our players who are going to be
free agents,'' Melvin said. ``But that doesn't change our thinking.
We're still going to try and win every game that we can. This does
give a chance to some of our young players.'' THIS REPORT CONTAINS

<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE _ Into everyone's life, a little rain must fall.
OK, sometimes it's a lot.
</P>
<P>
   And for a while during the thoroughbred season at Lone Star Park
at Grand Prairie, the track had to operate under the
when-it-rains-it-pours mode. There were 17 days of racing that were
conducted in rainy weather, compared to four last year.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike motorsports, baseball, golf and major tennis
tournaments, horse racing trudges on when the clouds burst. So it's
quite an accomplishment that average daily attendance at Lone Star
for the thoroughbred season was down only one percent compared to
last year.
</P>
<P>
   When the season ended last year, Lone Star was down four percent
in average daily attendance compared to the previous season.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe Lone Star is making progress.. It can be a challenge to
keep fans returning to a new and attractive facility when the
novelty is wearing off.
</P>
<P>
   The horse-racing product at Lone Star still remains on the list
of things to do for a sports fan/entertainment seeker in this
market. The facility is a financially solid franchise because its
long-term debt continues to be retired by the sales-tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   But the track, and the sport at large, is still only scratching
the surface. How far it can go will be determined by two things,
and neither has much to do with trying to open new racetracks in
minor markets including Lubbock and Laredo, initiatives Lone Star
has announced in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has to do with the ability to lobby legislatures in
the effort to expand its business, and it depends on the
imagination of the people who market and advertise the track and
the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing's ability to argue it's case in front of lawmakers
always is dicey. There's no better example than last week when
horse racing was a part of the political coalition urging passage
of a bill that would ban gambling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Horse-racing operators, like Lone Star president Corey Johnsen,
believe that part of their business is being undermined by people
who'd rather sit at home and bet through Internet sites based
offshore than go out to the track. Lone Star's off-track betting on
its races was down 14 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the doors fell off the bill once it hit the House of
Representatives. The bill came out of the Senate with an exemption
that would allow horse racing to handle wagers on Internet sites.
But that was removed in a House committee. Then, rather having the
bill pass by a simple majority, House rules were invoked that
required a two-third majority for passage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill got a simple majority, but failed to get a super
majority.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, however, it looks like the horse-racing industry will
push for a form of legalized, in-home account wagering when the
next session of the Legislature convenes in January in Austin. And
it could have an important lobbying ally with mainstream clout:
``TV Guide'' and Fox, which are major backers of the TVG network
that provides in-home telecasts of live horse racing via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   TVG also conducts account wagering, and residents in Kentucky,
Maryland and Oregon have legalized in-home account wagering. The
Legislature in Louisiana recently approved it for the opening of
the Fair Grounds racing season that starts in November in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star already is a partner with TVG. It has contracted with
the network to telecast races over TVG, even if people in Texas
can't legally bet on the races.
</P>
<P>
   But in a brave new world of people using their remotes to buy
exacta and trifecta bets the way they would purchase pay-per-view
boxing, horse racing is running somewhat of a risk. The sport is
bypassing an off-track betting system that, if overhauled from
previous failures experienced most notably in New York, could serve
as much as marketing outlets as convenient wagering locations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether horse-racing executives, and their television ally in
TVG, want to take that marketing route through off-track betting
locations _ dressed up as theme restaurants _ remains to be seen.
Whether any of it can get done or not depends on horse racing's
political clout.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lone Star did well during the rain this year, the track
still may want to build a boat.  &QL; 
It's the horses, stupid
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star has tried for four years to make the racing world
notice its Lone Star Derby. The track even offered a $1 million
bonus for any horse that could win the Lone Star Derby on April 22
and any of the Triple Crown races.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a moment this year when even the local racing fans
ignored the race, and national fans almost missed it.
</P>
<P>
   The horses were being saddled before the race, yet the crowd
gathered around the paddock was looking away. Most everyone was
looking skyward where a number of parachutists hired by Lone Star
as a sideshow entertainment act were floating down to the track.
High winds played havoc with the parachutes, and three skydivers
were injured when they hit the ground with more force than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The Lone Star Derby had to be delayed while one of the
parachutists was treated on the track for a broken leg. The race
was televised nationally, and it barely made it before ESPN had to
switch to another scheduled event.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Lone Star officials could only say the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can rest assured,'' general manager Steve Sexton said.
``We won't be doing this again right before one of our big races.''
 &QL; 
Money in hand
</P>
<P>
   When Tahkodha Hills won the Lone Star Derby, he became eligible
for a $1 million bonus that Lone Star paid about $60,000 to
underwrite. Tahkodha Hills had to win one of the Triple Crown
events to cash the million. The owner of the colt would get
$750,000. The trainer would get $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Ralph Zaidie, trainer of Tahkodha Hills, already cashed that
day at Lone Star. He also trained Sir Bear, who won the Texas Mile
about 35 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The winner's share of a race is 60 percent of the purse. Because
both the Lone Star Derby and Texas Mile are $300,000 events, the
winner's share is $180,000 for each race. A trainer gets paid 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So Zaidie's take was $36,000. He would get no more. Tahkodha
Hills skipped the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, then
finished ninth in the 11-horse field of the Belmont Stakes.  &QL; 
Who's in first?
</P>
<P>
   Corey Lanerie, who was leading rider at Lone Star in 1999,
became the all-time leading rider at the track when he rode his
212th winner May 3. But he moved to Arlington International
Racecourse near Chicago when that track opened May 14.
</P>
<P>
   Lanerie became the all-time leader by overtaking Marlon St.
Julien, who led the standings in 1998 before he moved to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Julien makes occasional appearances at Lone Star, and he
came back to the track May 29 to ride in a collection of stakes
races. And when he rode two winners that day, he moved back ahead
of Lanerie by one.
</P>
<P>
   Lanerie came back to ride June 17 and finished second in the
$250,000 Dallas Turf Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that Marlon got back in the lead,'' Lanerie said.
``The day he did it, I called my agent and said, `You know Marlon's
ahead again.' We'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien also came back again, to ride July 3 in the $150,000
Grand Prairie Turf Challenge. He won.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Ronald Ardoin, who has been riding at Lone Star all this
season in addition to previous seasons, won two races Friday night
to go to 215 and one ahead of St. Julien. So now he's the all-time
leading rider at Lone Star.  &QL; 
Season down the tubes
</P>
<P>
   It was looking like a breakthrough season for jockey Donnie
Meche. Meche, 25, won graded stakes races at Fair Grounds in New
Orleans for Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   And he had a 14-race lead in the jockey standings this season at
Lone Star before a trip to the lake. He climbed onto a tube pulled
behind a power boat and suffered a small break in his right
shoulder when he was flung off the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to swing the whip with his right arm, Meche still tried
to ride in the All-Star Jockey Championship on June 23. He won one
of the races against riders like Pat Day and Laffit Pincay Jr. and
had the lead in the competition heading into the final race.
</P>
<P>
   But Edgar Prado, the nation's leading rider by number of
victories the past three years, won the final race. That put him in
a tie with Meche, with the tiebreaker determined by the jockey who
received the most points in the last race. So the title went to
Prado.
</P>
<P>
   Because he missed the last 22 days of the racing season to rest
the shoulder, Meche also lost the Lone Star season riding title to
Glen Murphy.  &QL; 
So high, so low
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing has highs and lows. And trainer Wes Hawley
experienced both in a matter of a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   Hawley won his first career stakes race with Caro's Royalty on
May 29 in the $100,000 Lone Star Park Turf Sprint. But he had to
scratch Midnight Klugh from the Grade III Lone Star Park Handicap
the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two days later, it was clear why Hawley had to do
that. Midnight Klugh was not able to recover from founder in his
foot. It's a painful condition that's often fatal. Hawley and
veterinarians were unable to save him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I win my first career stakes race, and then this happens,''
Hawley said. ``This is tough. I thought a lot about that horse. I
went back to the racing office and got the stakes saddlecloth with
his name on it, and I got choked up.''  &QL; 
A Lone Star heritage?
</P>
<P>
   Heritage Of Gold was named Horse of the Meet in 1999 at Lone
Star after she won three stakes races. To the surprise of many, the
local horse has developed into one of the nation's best. After the
Lone Star season, she won graded stakes race last year on the East
Coast and finished third in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. Are there
any horses from this year's season at Lone Star who could turn into
the next Heritage Of Gold?
</P>
<P>
   Luftikus: The horse's trainer, Vladimir Cerin, is one of
nation's hottest prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Nugget: He tries a major race Sunday in the Grade I Eddie
Read Handicap at Southern California's prestigious Del Mar meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Superpave: Trainer being cautious, but appearance in a Breeders'
Cup undercard race is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Hits: Impressive 2-year-old must recover from slight
shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel's Viva: Little filly got good late in season, and she
could stand out next year at Fair Grounds or Oaklawn.

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ OK, repeat after me three times.
</P>
<P>
   It's always about money. It's always about money. It's always
about money.
</P>
<P>
   Now think about Cowboys offensive tackle Erik Williams' supposed
holdout//retirement for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't show up for camp at Midwestern State University,
which ranks as a smart move considering the sweltering heat.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys initially describe his absence as a ``business''
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' agent, Alan Herman, however, said his client has lost
his desire to play the game and is contemplating retirement. Herman
also scolds the Cowboys for hinting that Williams' intentions are
less than pure.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys then say Williams is mulling several future career
options, including retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's natural for Williams to contemplate retirement at
this stage in his career. He has three Super Bowl rings. He has
four Pro Bowl appearances in nine years. He has also suffered a
career-threatening knee injury and has been demonized for several
off-the-field incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 32, has packed a lot into his nine seasons with the
Cowboys. The retirement of Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin, a close
friend of Williams, doesn't help the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones understands all this, which is mainly
why he's not forcing the issue by fining Williams. He could be
fined up to $5,000 a day as long as he's away.
</P>
<P>
   But while it's not beyond reason that Williams, who's also
engaged to be married, is ready to start a new life, it still just
doesn't seem logical that he is ready to walk away from football.
</P>
<P>
   And even if he is as financially secure as his agent contends,
why would he walk away from roughly $5.4 million. That's $1.9
million in forfeited salary in 2000 and 2001 and another $1.6
million in signing-bonus money he would have to pay back to the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to want more money. It's another to give money
away, which is why the former makes more sense than the latter.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Williams' $1.9 million annual salary for the next
two years is low for a player presumably at the top of his game,
which three Pro Bowl selections in the past four years suggest.
</P>
<P>
   The league's top offensive linemen are making more than twice
Williams' salary. That's tough for an ego to digest. Players at
this stage in their career are moved by how they feel when they are
being appreciated. You measure that by money. Sources have said
that Williams would be in camp if the Cowboys showed him some more
appreciation//money.
</P>
<P>
   His problem, however, is leverage, or lack of leverage.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not what you think. The Cowboys aren't taking a
hard-line stance of not redoing Williams' contract because of his
supposed bad-boy past. Jones is not upset at Williams' absence
because of the support the Cowboys gave him during some tough
times.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is a realist, saying the Cowboys' support of Williams
wasn't philanthropic. It was because of what he did on the football
field and his importance during the three world-championship
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jones also knows that Williams is no longer the player
he used to be, no matter the recent Pro Bowl pedigree. He was
considered to be no more than the team's third-best offensive
lineman last year, behind guard Larry Allen and future Pro Bowl
left tackle Flozell Adams.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cowboys are convinced that last season's second-round
pick, Solomon Page, who is filling in for Williams at right tackle,
is as good as Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The only hitch in the plan is that the Cowboys believe their
best five offensive linemen include Williams playing tackle and
Page playing guard.
</P>
<P>
   With Page at tackle, free-agent signee Jorge Diaz and veteran
backup Tony Hutson are the guard candidates, which is a dropoff
from the Page//Williams combo.
</P>
<P>
   But not so much that Jones is willing to be held hostage for
more money.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever this standoff ends, remember: It's always about money.

<P>
   Arbitration hearing dates are set for the Stars' two restricted
free agents who filed for arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Jere Lehtinen's case will be heard Aug. 10, and Blake Sloan's on
Aug. 12. The hearings, which can get harsh and leave bitter
feelings as teams argue against the merits of their own players,
can be avoided if contracts are worked out before the hearing
dates.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have resolved all of their past arbitration cases
before the hearing dates.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen earned $1.5 million last year, one in which injuries
limited him to three goals in 17 regular-season games. Sloan, who
earned $357,000 last season, completed his first full season with
the Stars as a regular-season fixture on the checking line.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there has been no communication between the Stars and
the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not talked to either one,'' Stars assistant general
manager Doug Armstrong said yesterday.  &QL; 
Free-agent update
</P>
<P>
   Unrestricted free-agent defenseman Dave Manson could still wind
up with the Stars. Manson is looking for a team where he can fit in
as a third or fourth defenseman, which would mean a higher salary
and more ice time. With the Stars, the physical Manson would be a
third-pair defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Manson, 33, earned $1.65 million last season. His only chance of
earning close to that amount is somewhere other than Dallas. Manson
rejected the Stars' offer, which was more than a million dollars
less than his 1999-2000 salary, according to Manson's agent, Don
Meehan, before becoming an unrestricted free agent July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Manson would likely return to the Stars if he can't find what
he's looking for in the free-agent market. Stars general manager
Bob Gainey said he has informed Manson that they are willing to
discuss some flexibility in their offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also remain in talks with veteran winger Ted Donato,
who played for the Anaheim Mighty Ducks last season in what was a
down year in his up-and-down career.
</P>
<P>
   Negotations with high-priced Claude Lemieux have stalled, but
Gainey said talks could resume as Lemieux and the Stars explore
other opportunities.

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Cowboys are keeping a short list of
out-of-work NFL kickers at their fingertips, just in case neither
of the two rookie kickers in camp makes the 53-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes Michael Husted, Jeff Jaeger, Chris Boniol,
Scott Blanton and Richie Cunningham. Even 43-year-old Eddie Murray,
who finished with the Cowboys last season, is on the list.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the job belongs to either Tim Seder or Rian
Lindell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our young guys know the plan,'' Cowboys kickers coach Steve
Hoffman said. ``They know I want one of them to make it. But if by
the end of August it doesn't work out ... well, we can always bring
in a couple of veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman has talked recently to Murray and Boniol, both of whom
are former Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie knows \rthe plan\s. Boniol knows \rthe plan\s. I think
our young guys know it's a business,'' Hoffman said. ``I also think
they know I want one of them to make it. If that's coddling, then
I'm coddling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are in a similar situation at punter, where two
unproven players are competing for a job left vacant by the
departure of Toby Gowin.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys lost Gowin to free agency (New Orleans) and decided
not to re-sign Murray, who came out of retirement after 12 games
last season to replace Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman acknowledges that having a rookie kicker can make a
coach nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm nervous with any kicker,'' Hoffman said. ``It's just
that you're more nervous with a rookie because he hasn't been to
all the stadiums, so he has to learn on the run.''
</P>
<P>
   This year on the road, head coach Dave Campo will take his team
to the opposing stadium the day before each game. This will allow
whoever wins the kicking job to visualize lining up the
game-winning field goal, check into his hotel room and sleep on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RSeder and Lindell\S are pretty steady and don't show their
nerves,'' Hoffman said. ``Right now, I wouldn't be too nervous with
either one of them. Early in camp, I'm looking to see if they get
happy feet or take an extra little jab step or punch their
follow-through.''
</P>
<P>
   The rookies are about as similar in appearance as Penn and
Teller. At 6-foot-3, 241 pounds, Lindell could be an NFL tight end.
At 5-9, 180, Seder could only be a kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Lindell, 23, kicked in a Rose Bowl for Washington State. Seder,
25, went to Ashland University and has been a high school
physical-education teacher in his hometown of Ashland, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Tim is a little more accurate,'' Hoffman said.
``But Rian has made some major changes with his stance and
follow-through. He's still getting used to a lot of stuff. So you
kind of wait and see how far Rian can get. The next few weeks
should tell the tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindell hasn't allowed the competition to keep him from working
on his new technique, even with as many as four kickers in the
off-season programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a guy will go back to the way he was doing it, just
so he can hang with the competition,'' Hoffman said. ``Not Rian.
Jon Hilbert was way ahead of him this spring, but Rian passed
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech rookie Jaret Greaser and Louisville's Hilbert were
released before training camp.
</P>
<P>
   At punter, Utah State rookie Micah Knorr has had to undergo
technique changes while Fordham's Barry Cantrell, a first-year
player (Cowboys' 1998 training camp), has been left alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry is polished ... \Rbut\S Micah is catching up fast,''
said Hoffman, adding that Knorr struggled early with his technique
changes. ``He just finally turned the corner the other day. He
understands now what I was trying to get him to ``feel.'' And once
they ``feel'' it, it's almost like you don't coach them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cantrell-Knorr punting duel, according to Hoffman, really
comes down to a kickoff battle. That's because the Cowboys want
their punter _ a la Gowin the past three seasons _ to kick off. The
punter also will be the holder on field-goal and PAT attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is someone to be just a steady punter ... don't
get us in trouble,'' Hoffman said, ``and to be a great kickoff
guy.''

Rodriguez injured
<TEXT>
<P>
   Catcher Ivan Rodriguez left last night's game in the first
inning after injuring his right thumb. Rodriguez was taken to the
hospital for X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   It was later determined that Rodriguez had a broken thumb and
would miss the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred with Kevin Stocker on first and Mo Vaughn at
the plate with a 3-2 count. Stocker ran on the pitch from starting
pitcher Kenny Rogers. Vaughn swung and missed, and lunged across
the plate. As Rodriguez threw to second, his thumb hit Vaughn's
bat.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hasn't missed a game because of injury since 1998.
Segui sought
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox and New York Mets have expressed interest in
Rangers designated hitter/first baseman David Segui, according to
major-league officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox designated first baseman Mike Stanley for assignment
Sunday and remain interested in acquiring a player who can hit
left-handed such as Segui, a switch hitter who can become a free
agent after this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox also have discussed acquiring Philadelphia's Rico
Brogna, who hit more than 20 homers and drove in at least 100 runs
the previous two seasons. Brogna also can become a free agent after
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' interest in Segui stems from the injury to third
baseman Robin Ventura, who went on the 15-day disabled list July 14
with a strain in his right rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   Reserves Matt Franco and Lenny Harris have played third base
during Ventura's absence, but first baseman Todd Zeile could move
to the opposite corner if the Mets acquire a first baseman. Zeile
played third base for Rangers during the 1998 and '99 seasons
before signing with the Mets as a free agent.
Resodded infield ``choppy''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers returned home for the first time since the All-Star
break to find new grass on the field. The turf in the infield and
in right field was re-sodded during the team's extended road trip
to replace dead and dying grass.
</P>
<P>
   After taking ground balls during batting practice, the Rangers
infielders said the new turf isn't as smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad,'' shortstop Royce Clayton said, shaking his head.
``It's choppy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clouds of sand flew up when batted balls bounced in the infield,
and manager Johnny Oates was concerned the infielders might have
trouble seeing grounders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different,'' third baseman Mike Lamb said. ``It's just
something else we have to deal with. That's why we get paid the big
bucks.''
Perisho to pitch
</P>
<P>
   Matt Perisho became the starting pitcher for tomorrow's game
when he wasn't needed in the bullpen in the early innings last
night.
</P>
<P>
   Since being knocked out in the first inning at Seattle on
Friday, Perisho has been available as a long reliever in place of
Doug Davis, who pitched 4 2/3 innings in relief that night.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates wanted to give Davis another day to
recover, so Perisho again was in the bullpen yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis said he's ready, but I'd like to give him another day,''
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   If Perisho had been needed, Davis would have made the start
tomorrow.  &LR; subheds:Milestone save  &LR; agatea:John Wetteland's save
Sunday was his 25th of the season, the ninth consecutive year he
has reached that plateau. That's the second longest such streak in
major-league history behind Lee Smith, who did it for 13
consecutive seasons from 1983-95.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland is tied for the third-most 25-save seasons behind
Smith and John Franco (11). Jeff Reardon and Dennis Eckersley also
saved at least 25 games in nine seasons.
Kapler improving
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Gabe Kapler extended his hitting streak to a
season-best eight games with a home run in the fourth inning.
Kapler was hitting .407 (11-27) in the previous seven games to
raise his average from .241 to .261.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable at the plate,'' he said.
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Chad Hawkins, the Rangers' third-round pick in the
June amateur draft, went on the disabled list at Class-A Savannah
because of right elbow soreness. Hawkins attended Grapevine High
School and Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin Cubillan, the reliever acquired from the Toronto Blue
Jays in the Esteban Loaiza trade, earned his first save for
Triple-A Oklahoma on Sunday. Cubillan worked 1 2/3 scoreless
innings to preserve the RedHawks' 4-2 victory.

   Ravens' Lewis seizes opportunity to turn life around
</P>
<P>
   By RICHARD JUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WESTMINSTER, Md. _ Ray Lewis could have passed for the happiest
guy on earth Monday morning as he sprinted through the opening
practice of the Baltimore Ravens' training camp. He kidded with
teammates, gave rookies encouraging slaps, and all in all, seemed
to be approaching the whole thing with unbridled joy.
</P>
<P>
   He did not seem to mind the steady rain that fell or the
tropical humidity that made breathing difficult. Nor did he appear
bothered by the reporters who clustered around him to ask some of
the same old questions. The Pro Bowl middle linebacker smiled as he
peeled off his helmet to reveal a face covered in perspiration and
grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful for every day I can wake up,'' Lewis said.
``There's joy any time I step on the football field regardless of
what I've been through. I've learned that joy is just waking up
every morning _ not just walking on the football field.''
</P>
<P>
   In another place or time, Lewis might not love training camp so
much. He might not like the early wake-up calls, the long practices
or the late-night meetings. He might not like the six-week grind or
the bumps and bruises he must endure before the Ravens open a
regular season of high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis may be grateful for a lot of little things these days.
He is returning to football seven weeks after having double murder
charges dropped against him. Before then, he had undergone a
4{-month ordeal that began when two men were stabbed to death
outside an Atlanta nightclub in the hours after Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I can imagine how happy he is,'' teammate Shannon Sharpe
said. ``Spending the rest of your life in prison is no joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last January, Lewis was known only as one of the NFL's
best linebackers, a rising star who had been chosen for three
consecutive Pro Bowls and led the league in tackles in 1999. Now,
he may never be known for those accomplishments again.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he will be remembered as the guy charged with murder
because of a fight that took place outside a nightclub in which
Lewis partied until 4 a.m. A weak case quickly came undone after
the trial began, and the charges against Lewis were dropped. But
Lewis did plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of obstructing
justice. In simple terms, he admitted to lying to police during the
murder investigation and is on probation for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis also testified against his two companions, but a jury
acquitted them on all counts. By the time the verdict was read,
Lewis had returned to Maryland to begin preparing for a new season.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his arrest, he seemed the latest in a series of
black eyes for the NFL. Carolina wide receiver Rae Carruth had been
charged with murder a few weeks earlier, so the two of them _
Carruth and Lewis _ became poster boys for what some saw as a
league of thugs. Green Bay tight end Mark Chmura was later charged
with sexual assault, and Indianapolis running back Fred Lane was
shot and killed after a dispute with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is alive and free, but his reputation is badly damaged. He
wasn't guilty of murder, but in the weeks before the trial, it was
revealed he had been charged with domestic abuse by at least one
former girlfriend. He also was captured in an X-rated video
enjoying a raunchy sex act.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while his public image probably is damaged beyond repair and
while he clearly is something less than the model citizen he
occasionally had been portrayed as, it is the murder charges that
could have sent him away for life. And despite the charges, there
wasn't presented a single piece of evidence that he had done
anything except be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   So Monday morning, he was back at work. He declared himself ``in
the best shape'' of his career, thanks in part to Sharpe, who
signed with Baltimore after 10 seasons in Denver. Sharpe befriended
Lewis, and each day after the trial, the two would meet in an
Atlanta gym and lift weights.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the grueling nature of the workouts and the friendly
competition that developed allowed him to survive the stress of the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shannon is a friend,'' Lewis said Monday. ``It was a blessing
we came together. Every day I was leaving the courtroom, I went to
work out. I think it kept my mind off it. It kept me settled. We
just went out and worked. I've always worked out, but he helped
give me a little more focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has spoken publicly about the incident only a couple of
times and politely declared the subject off limits Monday. However,
his teammates spoke effusively of their respect for him and the
sympathy they feel for what he has been through.
</P>
<P>
   ``In situations like Ray went through, some people will turn on
you,'' safety Kim Herring said. ``You find out who your friends
are. There wasn't one guy on this team who turned his back on Ray.
We gave him our full support. And we're happy to see him out here.
He's probably one of the happiest guys anyone knows. To go through
what he's gone through and to be able to come back and play, I
think he's probably looking at things in a different light.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe said he warned Lewis that he had better see things
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is young (25),'' Sharpe said. ``But I told Ray that at
some point in time, you can't use age as an excuse. People are
eventually going to think that the decisions he made were a
reflection on the person instead of the age. You have to start
being accountable. I told him he got his one strike; now learn from
it and move on. He's a good guy. He made a mistake. He realizes he
made a mistake. Now, he's going to learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Lewis has admitted to is bad judgment and misleading police
investigators. In a news conference after the trial, he explained
why he lied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in situations that you've never been in your life, so
you just react,'' he said. ``And when you react, your reactions are
not all the time right. I think what I did was wrong. I'm paying
for it now with 12 months of probation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the guilty plea, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue
declined to suspend Lewis, saying he already had been punished
enough. Tagliabue did ask Lewis to speak at the league's annual
symposium for rookies to discuss what he had learned from his
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was not on the schedule of speakers, and his appearance
stunned the 254 participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have heard a pin drop,'' said Earnest Byner, the
Ravens' director of player development.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis spoke for 30 minutes and then had two long
question-and-answer sessions. He cautioned the rookies against
associating with the wrong crowd and warned them to be cautious in
their private lives. He received a standing ovation when he was
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``A situation got me to a point to change,'' Lewis told the
rookies, according to a transcript released by the NFL. ``I had a
problem saying no to friends. You will come in contact with people
who always want to do something for you. We have to pick and choose
things we do. We're being watched 24 hours a day. Be firm and stand
on your own two feet. Understand that saying no to a lot of people
is very important. Be firm when you say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that when you step in the NFL, you're on a new
platform. Don't be with people who don't have the same focus as
you. You shouldn't be the only person trying to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his friends outside football insist Lewis has changed
for the good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray realizes now that his mission in life is bigger than
football,'' Rev. Richard Harris, who attended the trial as the
linebacker's spiritual adviser, told the Baltimore Sun. ``Football
is just a means to an end, a means to give him a forum to really do
what God has commissioned him to do. This was a test to give Ray a
testimony. He bent, but it didn't break his spirit. It was a test
of faith. I think he passed the test. He's been to hell and back.''
</P>
<P>
   In his only extensive public comments on the matter, Lewis said:
``If there is anything I would change in my lifestyle, it's the
choices I make. I've always been a guy who made great choices,
always been a guy who kept his head on. Everybody stumbles every
once in a while. But I don't think it's about stumbling. It's about
recovery, seeing where you go from there. I would never wish on my
worst enemy to go through what I've been through.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens have attempted to make his return as normal as
possible. Team owner Art Modell has asked his organization to
shield Lewis from ``unwanted exposure and let time take its
course.'' His teammates have embraced him with love and
good-natured kidding. They believe that if the Ravens are as good
as advertised this season, and if Lewis has another Pro Bowl
season, the repairing of his reputation will have begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy it's over and he's out there,'' cornerback Rod
Woodson said. ``We don't want to talk about that anymore. We want
to get on with the season.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Even before his stunning victory in the British
Open, Tiger Woods was a golfing phenomenon. Now he has become much
more, the single most influential figure in world sports, an icon
to millions, the new Muhammad Ali, the new Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   And, pretty soon, the $759,150 purse he took away from St.
Andrews is going to look like a drop in the ocean compared with the
billions of dollars he is likely to generate for himself, for golf,
and for the economy of the world's golf-playing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Already Monday, media commentators on both sides of the Atlantic
were speculating that Woods could become the world's first
billion-dollar sponsorship franchisee.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear exactly how much money he will end up being
offered, and even less clear how much he will end up taking, given
his reputation for modesty and pure professional dedication to the
craft of golf, but it is clear that, what he doesn't earn for
himself, others will revel in earning through him.
</P>
<P>
   Across the U.S., a golf-course building mania has set in, and
it's all due to Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   He's done the impossible, making golf cool to young people, and
broken down the sport's crusty image as a pursuit for pampered
middle-aged white men with expanding waistlines.
</P>
<P>
   After the victory in last month's U.S. Open, the president of
the NBC television network, Dick Ebersol, said Woods had completed
what he called ``the last step in a 3 1/2-year process to join Ali
and Jordan as the only athletes in the TV generation to be larger
than life.''
</P>
<P>
   The British victory, making Woods the youngest holder of all
four major golf championships as well as the breaker of several
course and world golfing records, has only spread the mythology.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics speak for themselves: the only golfer to avoid a
bunker in 72 holes at St. Andrews; the lowest shot-count, 19 under
par, in major golf competition history; the ability to make rivals
look like floundering amateurs while showing signs of constant
improvement in his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger has no opposition, only a field,'' wrote George Vecsey
in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali had Frazier. Navratilova had Evert. DiMaggio had Williams
and Musial. McGwire has Sosa. Tiger has only himself and his caddie
and his touch and his inner light, but that is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Woods first turned professional, many industry
observers thought Nike was insane to offer him a $40 million
sponsorship deal over five years. Golf accounted for only 2 percent
of the company's sales, and Woods was far from a surefire
phenomenon then.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nike is selling golf balls, golf shirts, clubs and carrying
bags as though they were the last chocolate cookies on earth.
Already, an advertisement he did for Nike bouncing a golf ball on a
wedge with awe-inspiring control has become legendary.
</P>
<P>
   He has managed to sign a second official endorsement deal with
Nike's golf equipment rivals Titleist and he has deals with
American Express, Rolex, Wheaties cereal and Electronic Arts, which
makes a golfing video game with the Tiger image.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' career income from tournaments _ $20 million, including
$5 million this year so far _ is starting to look paltry. Before
his double coup, his father Earl estimated he could be earning $1.5
million per weekend for sponsored appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has shown repeatedly that money is not his top priority.
He refused to take part in U.S. television advertisements out of
solidarity with an actors' strike. And he devotes much of his free
time to the Tiger Woods Foundation, touring at his own expense to
hold golf clinics for young, often disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he likes it or not, he is likely to become a
mini-industry. At the peak of Michael Jordan's career, he was
estimated to be worth $1 billion to the city of Chicago, home of
his team the Bulls, and around $10 billion to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   With decades of golf-playing ahead, Tiger Woods could be putting
that achievement deep into the shade. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE CHENEY OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs headline and lede graf for updating)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 25:
</P>
<P>
   Fate and the Bush family _ or maybe it is fate in the form of
the Bush family _ seem to have a way of intervening in the life of
Dick Cheney. In 1988, he was serving as minority whip in the House
of Representatives when President George Bush made him secretary of
defense after the Senate rejected the nomination of Sen. John Tower
of Texas. This year, Cheney was out of government and five years
into a career as a Texas oil executive when Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas made him director of his vice-presidential search committee.
It now appears that Cheney has found himself. Therein hangs a
splendid opportunity for political divination.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's most obvious asset as a running mate is that he could
provide an instant gravitas injection for a ticket headed by Bush.
Given Cheney's role in running the gulf war, his presence would
shore up Bush in his weakest areas, foreign policy and national
security. The downside is that a Cheney selection would allow
Democrats to argue that the lightly experienced Bush is still
dependent on both his father's name and his key advisers. The
counterspin from the Bush campaign would be that the candidate is
secure enough to surround himself with weighty figures.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever they say about Cheney, the Democrats would be
relieved to see his name on the ticket rather than that of Gen.
Colin Powell. For months, supporters of Vice President Al Gore have
spoken of Bush-Powell as a nightmare ticket that would put the
election out of reach before it begins. Campaigns, of course,
rarely play out in predictable ways, but there is no doubt that
Powell could change the dynamic in a way that no one else could.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of excitement, Cheney offers solidity, unity and, based
on his record at defense, toughness. His House record is
conservative enough for the Republican right. At 59, he does not
represent as big a threat to younger Republicans looking to run for
president in four or eight years. Then there is the loyalty issue.
Bush would never have to worry about Cheney's next quote, not the
case if he picked a prickly free spirit like Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   This record would provide plenty of targets for Gore, who might
also be relieved that Cheney, a Wyoming native, would not have an
obvious impact on the electoral vote.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush does select Cheney, though, that choice might in some
way be connected to Gore's own service as vice president. President
Clinton and Gore got the public fully accustomed to seeing the vice
president cast and marketed as a senior adviser rather than a space
holder. If he chooses Cheney, Bush will be giving that model a
place of even greater prominence.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even before his stunning victory in the British
Open, Tiger Woods was a golfing phenomenon. Now he has become much
more, the single most influential figure in world sports, an icon
to millions, the new Muhammad Ali, the new Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   And, pretty soon, the $759,150 purse he took away from St.
Andrews is going to look like a drop in the ocean compared with the
billions of dollars he is likely to generate for himself, for golf,
and for the economy of the world's golf-playing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Already Monday, media commentators on both sides of the Atlantic
were speculating that Woods could become the world's first
billion-dollar sponsorship franchisee.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear exactly how much money he will end up being
offered, and even less clear how much he will end up taking, given
his reputation for modesty and pure professional dedication to the
craft of golf, but it is clear that, what he doesn't earn for
himself, others will revel in earning through him.
</P>
<P>
   Across the U.S., a golf-course building mania has set in, and
it's all due to Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   He's done the impossible, making golf cool to young people, and
broken down the sport's crusty image as a pursuit for pampered
middle-aged white men with expanding waistlines.
</P>
<P>
   After the victory in last month's U.S. Open, the president of
the NBC television network, Dick Ebersol, said Woods had completed
what he called ``the last step in a 3 1/2-year process to join Ali
and Jordan as the only athletes in the TV generation to be larger
than life.''
</P>
<P>
   The British victory, making Woods the youngest holder of all
four major golf championships as well as the breaker of several
course and world golfing records, has only spread the mythology.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics speak for themselves: the only golfer to avoid a
bunker in 72 holes at St. Andrews; the lowest shot-count, 19 under
par, in major golf competition history; the ability to make rivals
look like floundering amateurs while showing signs of constant
improvement in his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger has no opposition, only a field,'' wrote George Vecsey
in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali had Frazier. Navratilova had Evert. DiMaggio had Williams
and Musial. McGwire has Sosa. Tiger has only himself and his caddie
and his touch and his inner light, but that is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Woods first turned professional, many industry
observers thought Nike was insane to offer him a $40 million
sponsorship deal over five years. Golf accounted for only 2 percent
of the company's sales, and Woods was far from a surefire
phenomenon then.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nike is selling golf balls, golf shirts, clubs and carrying
bags as though they were the last chocolate cookies on earth.
Already, an advertisement he did for Nike bouncing a golf ball on a
wedge with awe-inspiring control has become legendary.
</P>
<P>
   He has managed to sign a second official endorsement deal with
Nike's golf equipment rivals Titleist and he has deals with
American Express, Rolex, Wheaties cereal and Electronic Arts, which
makes a golfing video game with the Tiger image.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' career income from tournaments _ $20 million, including
$5 million this year so far _ is starting to look paltry. Before
his double coup, his father Earl estimated he could be earning $1.5
million per weekend for sponsored appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has shown repeatedly that money is not his top priority.
He refused to take part in U.S. television advertisements out of
solidarity with an actors' strike. And he devotes much of his free
time to the Tiger Woods Foundation, touring at his own expense to
hold golf clinics for young, often disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he likes it or not, he is likely to become a
mini-industry. At the peak of Michael Jordan's career, he was
estimated to be worth $1 billion to the city of Chicago, home of
his team the Bulls, and around $10 billion to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   With decades of golf-playing ahead, Tiger Woods could be putting
that achievement deep into the shade. &QL;

YANKS DEFEAT ORIOLES, 4-3 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The T-shirt stretched over Glenallen Hill's muscular
torso tightly, like a coat of paint, when he ambled into the New
York Yankees' clubhouse on Monday afternoon at the end of a
workout, a wide weight belt wrapped around his waist.
</P>
<P>
   He is their designated hit man now, a specialist acquired to
fill a very specific role: haunt left-handed pitchers. Hill is
defensively challenged, he runs the way a man should run at age 35
and he provides little versatility. But the Yankees figure he can
effectively accomplish his one task, and on Monday night, when he
saw his first pitch as a Yankee since being acquired from the
Chicago Cubs last week, Hill slammed a home run _ against a
left-handed pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' Roger Clemens threw erratically over six innings,
walking five, but was good enough to win his fifth consecutive
decision, 4-3, against the Baltimore Orioles. The Yankees are
52-42, 10 games over .500 for the first time since May 19.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deadline is a week away, and most of the Yankees'
shopping _ often left to the last minute _ is finished. They got
the slugger they wanted in David Justice and a front-line pitcher
in Denny Neagle. Jose Vizcaino gives them protection against the
possibility that second baseman Chuck Knoblauch's throwing jitters
will resurface. They seek a left fielder, and have talked
extensively with the Montreal Expos about a deal for Rondell White,
and more recently with the Orioles about B.J. Surhoff.
</P>
<P>
   And they have Hill to harass left-handed pitchers. From 1995 to
1999, Hill batted .320 against lefties, with 29 homers in 509
at-bats, while hitting .266 against right-handed pitchers. He will
not get many chances against lefties, because there are few
left-handers. The Yankees have played 94 games, and lefties have
started just 25 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hill got a rare opportunity on Monday night. The left-hander
John Parrish made his major league debut for the Orioles and Joe
Torre, the Yankees' manager, used Hill as his designated hitter,
batting cleanup, between Bernie Williams and Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish, 22, appeared to surprise the Yankees in the first
inning, which is not unusual. They were seeing the youngster for
the first time, and besides a few words jotted in their scouting
report, they really had no insight into how he pitched. Knoblauch
watched a Parrish fastball whiz past him for a third strike to open
the game, and Derek Jeter and Williams swung over curveballs.
Parrish had struck out three All-Stars in his first inning in the
big leagues and he jogged off the mound to cheers, the memory of a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   But Parrish knew nothing about Hill, about how he mashes
fastballs in the inner half of the strike zone, and it was Hill who
added a dose of reality to Parrish's experience. Parrish tried
firing a fastball with his first pitch of the second, armpit high.
Hill redirected it, on a line, the sound of contact making clear to
everyone that he had just slugged a homer, and he swaggered around
the bases. ``It takes the edge off, when you do something to help
the team,'' Hill said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said: ``He definitely has that ability. He's a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   That homer tied the score at 1-1, and when Hill laced a hard
grounder past third baseman Ivanon Coffie in the next inning _ an
error on Coffie _ Jeter scored and the Yankees led, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens threw 25 pitches in the first inning, 25 in the
second, and continued to labor, allowing a run in the third inning
and walking Baltimore's first two batters in the fourth inning
before pitching out of trouble. The thought occurred to Torre that
this was a game in which Clemens was able to draw on his recent
success. If he had not put together the string of victories, if he
had felt badly about himself and his stuff, then this was the type
of night when he might have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens pressed on into the sixth. He walked Will Clark _ whom
he had nailed with a high fastball in the upper back in the second
inning _ before Charles Johnson blooped a single. First and second
and nobody out. Clemens stood behind the mound and drew a deep
breath.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Baines popped to short center, before Clemens struck out
Coffie. But Clemens' left quadriceps began to tighten, cramps
beginning to overcome him. He walked Brady Anderson, filling the
bases, then motioned catcher Jorge Posada to the mound, essentially
to kill time. When Torre jogged to the mound with the trainer Steve
Donohue, Clemens asked Torre to stay, to buy more time to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't coming out of the game right there,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   Not with the bases loaded and two outs and the lead on the line.
Clemens attacked the next hitter, Mike Bordick, with splitters, one
splitter after another, until Bordick swung and missed and struck
out. Clemens walked off the mound, pumping a fist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He earned this one tonight,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   The game had not been over five minutes when Hill strolled out
of the Yankees' clubhouse, headed for the weight room again. &QL;

TECH FIRMS SEE CLOUDS IN CORRIDOR &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The number of technology companies along the
Ventura Freeway Corridor has more than tripled in the past six
years but continued growth could be stifled without more capital
and better infrastructure, according to a study being released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The area from Woodland Hills to Camarillo is now home to 600
companies employing 115,000 people in tech industries, a
significant jump since the recession of the early 1990s, according
to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a hitch: Traffic and housing shortages threaten to
strangle the corridor by its own success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this warning sign on the horizon that we've unearthed
in this report that people might not want to live here,'' said
Rohit Shukla, president/chief executive officer of larta, the Los
Angeles Regional Technology Alliance. ``If companies are going to
have to grow in the corridor, they have to be able to attract the
best and the brightest.''
</P>
<P>
   The 101 Corridor stretches from Woodland Hills in the west San
Fernando Valley to Camarillo in central Ventura County. It
typically includes Chatsworth, Moorpark and Simi Valley,
communities that aren't along the Ventura Freeway but that have
close economic ties to the other corridor communities.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, which is being released to coincide with
a conference drawing attention to the region, companies might be
turned off from the region by dwindling office space and rising
lease rates. Their employees _ or perspective employees _ could be
turned off by long commutes and, among younger technology
professionals, a lack of hipness compared with West Los Angeles or
the South Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``How Green is Our Valley? Technology and
Transformation Along the Ventura Freeway Corridor,'' says local
universities need to contribute more to the tech work force and
that the area gets far less venture capital proportionally than
either Southern California or the United States as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, said report co-author Shukla, the corridor
needs to build a strong sense of identity like that of the Silicon
Valley. The area he prefers to call the ``101 Corridor'' has a
catchy enough name to take hold nationally but he added that's only
a small part of the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a decent name in its own right,'' he said. ``The
question is can the corporations really extend the brand?''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old organization believes the area has marquee name
employers to match Silicon Valley. The tech corridor is led by
companies like Litton Industries Inc., an employer of 4,000 that
remains predominantly a supplier of military communications
systems, and Amgen, the Thousand Oaks-based biotech drug
manufacturer that began with seven employees in 1980 and now
employs 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   All told, tech-based employers provide one out of every seven
jobs in 101 Freeway Corridor cities, according to the report.
Shukla estimates that when the organization was founded to divert
the defense industry's talent pool into new jobs, there were fewer
than 200 tech companies in the 101 Corridor. The report counts 600
now.
</P>
<P>
   Bonny Herman, president and chief executive officer of the
Valley Industry and Commerce Association, said there had been talk
of billing the area as a technology corridor 10 years ago but that
it never caught on because of the lack of companies in the area at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly the depth of tech companies now to justify
such a designation,'' said Herman, who will address the conference
tonight at the regional headquarters of GTE/Verizon in Thousand
Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Shukla said ``parochial tendencies'' among corridor cities could
dampen its chances of selling itself as a unified entity. The
report said, however, that the corridor is better suited to sell
itself as a place of small-town, family appeal in contrast with the
more urbanized Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the appealing thing about the Ventura
Corridor,'' said Jeff Jordan, GTE/Verizon vice president of sales
and another conference speaker. ``We have very moderately priced
housing in comparison. We have about everything you need here.''

NO MORE MR. USELESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The last time the Anaheim Angels' Scott
Schoeneweis pitched in a major-league game, he was near tears in
the clubhouse in Baltimore afterward, knowing he was headed to the
disabled list with a strained rib-cage muscle.
</P>
<P>
   That was June 16. Five weeks later, Schoeneweis was all smiles
in the clubhouse as he talked about his return to the rotation,
which will be Wednesday against the Texas Rangers. He could laugh
about the nickname he acquired while on the disabled list _ Mr.
Useless.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of Schoeneweis' injury didn't allow him to do much of
anything because it hurt whenever he moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do anything,'' said Schoeneweis, who is 5-5 with a
5.08 ERA in 14 starts. ``The world goes on without you. I didn't
feel part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schoeneweis said he was able to cope with it easier when he
reflected on his past _ he overcame testicular cancer when he was
in college, and he also had elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remembered back to how I used to deal with stuff when it was
serious,'' he said. ``It's a double-edged sword. (The injury) is
not that bad, but I thought I had my fair share of things going on,
injuries and stuff. It's just one more thing that adds fuel to the
fire. It makes you a better person, a better competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis said he also gets inspiration from veteran pitcher
Tim Belcher, who is on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch Belcher every single day,'' Schoeneweis said. ``He's
been hurt the last year or two and nobody in the clubhouse works
harder. It's a testament to his makeup. We might not talk about it,
but I want to be like that when I'm 38 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hands-off policy: Manager Mike Scioscia said he'd prefer not
to tinker with the batting order if possible. Although players like
clean-up hitter Tim Salmon and No. 5 hitter Garret Anderson have
struggled for extended periods this season, Scioscia is not quick
to shake things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the guys we have and you like the chemistry of the
lineup, you'd like to keep it as stable as you can,'' he said.
``You can get to a point where you'd like to be more productive,
but I don't think we're there. It's not like we're mired in a lack
of productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Shortstop Benji Gil returned to Orange County
on Monday to be with his wife Carly, who was scheduled to have
labor induced. It is the couple's first child. . . . Outfielder
Orlando Palmeiro has one career homer and it came here last year on
April 9 off John Burkett. Asked if The Ballpark at Arlington held
any special meaning for him, Palmeiro joked: ``It means nothing to
me, I don't know what you're talking about.'' &QL;

 HAVE YOU HUGGED YOUR TOURIST?  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Behold the noble tourist.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if this is an average day in San Francisco, he and
145,999 of his brothers and sisters will be touristing throughout
the city.
</P>
<P>
   He will spend his share of the daily tourist outpouring of
kindness and generosity, $17.9 million. That's a lot of Alcatraz
Swim Team T-shirts and walkaway crab cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   If he and his family and the other tourists were to disappear,
every San Francisco resident would have to spend an additional
$8,300 in the city every year to make up for the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   He arrives in the city by car only 18 percent of the time. When
it comes to Transit First, he shows us the way.
</P>
<P>
   He wears Bermuda shorts not because he is a doofus who can't
read a weather forecast, but because he is an optimist. Sun schmun,
he needs only the warmth of local hospitality and the golden glow
reflected off the city's treasures to ward off the goosebumps. That
and hot coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he knows that nobody ever dies of fogbite.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of us gripe about waiting for a bus, he waits 90
minutes for a cable car ride, as the cable car crews take the
world's longest breaks.
</P>
<P>
   He gawks and snaps photos because he appreciates the sights that
many of the rest of us have learned to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   So if you come across the tourist today, give him a big hug, and
while you're doing it, don't lift his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST IT WAS resentment. A lot of the pro golf stars didn't
appreciate the kid from Stanford coming to the pro tour without
having won anything and stealing their spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tiger Woods started winning a lot, and resentment gave way
to embarrassment. If you're regaling the girls at the party by
dancing around with the lamp shade on your head, and Pierce Brosnan
walks into the room, your act loses some luster.
</P>
<P>
   Now the other pros have reached the state of shock. They have no
idea how to deal with the Tiger Woods thing. You show up with your
``A'' game, attack the flags like a Marine commando, putt with the
touch of a safecracker, and ... lose like a dog.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the pros were assuring themselves, ``The kid can't
keep playing like this.'' They were right. He worked the kinks out
of his game.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a golf superstar, good luck on finding a corner stool
in a dark bar where the guy at the other end of the bar doesn't
want to ask you about Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Next tournament, they should give a lovely engraved tin cup to
the winner of the Non-Tiger flight.
</P>
<P>
   And yet: From here, it's a beautiful thing.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN DON JOHNSON met George Michalski 25 years ago, they both
cringed.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had just signed to star on a TV series, ``The City,'' he
wrote a theme song for the pilot and needed a musician to help him
nail down the music. Someone told him about Michalski, demon piano
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked like Manson,'' Michalski says, ``and he walked in
wearing a tennis outfit with a sweater tied around his neck. We're
both thinking, `This is  &UR; not  &LR; going to work.'''
</P>
<P>
   They instantly became best pals, were roomies for years, and
Michalski is musical director of Johnson's TV series, ``Nash
Bridges.'' George is the only other cast member who has been with
the show since its start six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Michalski rejects the TV formula of plugging a popular song into
mood spots in the show. He haunts San Francisco clubs for obscure
talent and gives local music a national showcase on ``Nash.'' He
has used the work of more than 50 artists and bands, like White
Trash Debutantes, Gone Jackyls and Blag Dahla.
</P>
<P>
   Michalski also presides over a wild salon/jam gig every Monday
night at Le Colonial. And on the TV show, any time Nash Bridges
walks into a joint that has a piano player, it's George.
</P>
<P>
   ATM MACHINE: I know, that's redundant.
</P>
<P>
   As Brian Lehman points out, ``ATM machine'' is like ``PIN
number,'' ``pre-recorded message'' and ``past history.''
</P>
<P>
   I like redundancies. I could repeat 'em again and again. Maybe
it's a sports thing. In sports, it's ``slam dunk,'' even though all
dunks are slammed and all slams are dunked. It's ``road trip,''
even though there are no stay-at-home trips. Runs batted in are
called ``RBIs,'' even though that would be ``runs-batted-ins.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixed metaphors are welcome here, too. Somebody requested of
Lehman, ``Give me a thumbnail sketch of the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   And Seth Magalaner remembers announcer Dick Stockton on an A's
telecast in '94: ``Here's Dean Palmer. ... he's a dangerous power
hitter but he also strikes out a bit. I guess you could say that's
the double-edged sword he brings to the dance.''
</P>
<P>
   IT'S GREAT that they're taking care not to squish the garter
snakes at the BART-to-SFO construction project. Robin Thomson
wonders if maybe they'd like some more snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Robin lives in Marin County, in a well-civilized-and-paved
suburb, but says her yard is lousy with garter snakes. Robin combed
the Internet for suggestions, hoping to find a humane, St.
Patrick-like method of thinning the herd. Nothing. Got any ideas?
</P>
<P>
   BIG SALE at the Rite Aid on West Portal, reports Maggie Holmes.
The sign in the cold-beverage section last Friday read, ``Back-to
school sale: Red Dog Beer, $5.49 a 12-pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Not sure what school they're referring to, but after a 12-pack
of the 'Dog, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Here's mud in your eye.

   LOS ANGELES _ Inspired by a kindergarten student's Lego rocket
ship, Canoga Park teacher Diane Russomanno wrote a children's book
series on space travel _ and it's won her a $54 million judgment
because her idea was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court jury ruled that Russomanno's series called
``Ricky Rocket'' formed the basis of an independently produced show
called ``A.J.'s Time Travelers,'' which has been aired on
children's TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hold my head up high now,'' Russomanno said Monday.
``This vindicates everything I did and felt over the last six
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried everything I possibly could to let people know that I
created the project. Now this case shows that the big guy doesn't
always necessarily have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Russomanno, 49, who taught at Kenter Canyon School in Brentwood
until deciding to write full time, was awarded $46 million in
punitive damages July 20, and $8 million in compensatory damages
July 14.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants _ an agent, television producers, distributors
and others accused of stealing her idea _ plan to appeal the award.
</P>
<P>
   Russomanno alleged that her former agent, Gianni Russo, and the
others ripped off her idea for an educational program called
``Ricky Rocket,'' which she had self-published in a book series in
1993. She claims that Russo turned her idea into ``A.J.'s Time
Traveler,'' in which the main character travels in, not a rocket,
but a time machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, then it is,'' said
Russomanno's Santa Barbara attorney, J. Paul Gignac.
</P>
<P>
   The jury ordered Russo to pay $3 million. Other entities
involved included: BKN Inc., a children's TV network, which was
ordered to pay $10 million; Bohbot Entertainment &AMP; Media Inc., the
parent company of the network, which was ordered to pay $10
million; Quantum Media International, the advertiser, which was
ordered to pay $5 million; and Time Travelers, Inc., ``A.J.''
producer, which must pay $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Others named in the lawsuit were found liable to pay $8 million
in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Joseph Kalin will set post-trial motion
dates Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Leyton, a Valencia attorney representing Time Travelers
Inc., Bohbot Media Inc. and Quantum Media International Inc., said
she plans to appeal the verdict, and will file post-trial motions
next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not over,'' she said. ``We find the damages erroneous.
There are various post-trial motions that we will be filing as well
as an appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Russomanno came up with the ``Ricky Rocket'' idea in 1990 while
teaching a class in which one of her students built a Lego rocket
and paraded it around the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, she wrote a series of books involving the
experiences of a young boy, named Ricky Rocket, who travels through
space and time in a magic rocket built from booster blocks. On his
journeys, he picks up tips on geography, math and English.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after publishing the books, Russomanno wrote a TV
script, and hired Russo as an agent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, she and Russo secured $12 million from an investment
group to finance production of 40 episodes, according to
Russomanno's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``In June 1994, Russo steals the show,'' said Gignac. ``Russo,
seeing the potential success of the show after taping the pilot,
forced Russomanno out, sued her, and changed the name of the show
to `A.J.'s Time Travelers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Russo filed suit against Russomanno in August 1994, in Clark
County, Nev. After negotiations, Russomanno and Russo signed a
settlement agreement in October 1994. At that time, Russo was
ordered to pay Russomanno $125,000, and he could not use a rocket
or spaceship, and the flying machine would not be allowed to travel
through air, space or water, according to Gignac.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1994, when Russomanno took her series to ABC, NBC,
Fox and Columbia TriStar, she said she was told that a similar idea
called ``A.J.'s Time Travelers,'' had already been pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated,'' Russomanno said.
</P>
<P>
   When ``A.J.'s Time Travelers'' first aired Dec. 4, 1994, on the
Fox Children's Network, Russomanno said, the time machine looked
like a rocket and was shown moving in outer space and under water.
The show now is broadcast on Encore's WAM Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time a segment airs,'' said another Russomanno lawyer,
Barry Cappello, ``it violates the agreement that Diane Russomanno
and Russo signed in 1994. We will be seeking an injunction against
any company airing these programs.''

REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS LIKE CHENEY _ FOR DIFFERENT REASONS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Not everyone felt comfortable saying so publicly,
but in Republican circles there was at least one universal reaction
to Richard Cheney becoming George W. Bush's running mate:
<P>
   Bush the younger would not repeat the mistake of Bush the elder.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney brings foreign policy expertise, a long resume and a
formidable reputation to the Republican ticket. In stark contrast
to Dan Quayle, George Herbert Walker Bush's running mate 12 years
ago, Cheney _ who at age 34 was President Ford's chief of staff _
is regarded as a heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by tapping his father's former Secretary of Defense, Bush
opens himself up to criticism that, after just 51/2 years of public
service, he is not yet his own man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, Cheney shores up foreign policy, but he opens up the
whole matter of Bush being nothing more than his father's son,''
said Democratic pollster Vic Fingerhut.
</P>
<P>
   Gleeful Democrats _ who early in the day fretted over reports
that retired General Colin Powell might be induced to join the
ticket _ said Cheney would be vulnerable on his conservative
congressional voting record which includes opposition to abortion,
environmental protections and the Equal Rights Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   And they seized upon the image of Bush selecting someone from
the ``old guard,'' as proof of the Governor's lack of political
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's stability and wealth of experience were touted as great
assets by Republicans who welcomed his addition to the ticket.
Cheney's background _ from President Gerald Ford's chief of staff
and 11 years as a member of Congress to President Bush's secretary
of defense _ make him a revered figure in the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no question from anybody that he's
qualified to be president,'' said Jack Pitney, a professor of
government at Claremont McKenna Colleage, and former aide to Cheney
from his days in the House in the early 1980s. ``You're not going
to have a `Quayle' problem, and that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney immediately adds heft to a ticket that had been
criticized for its lack of experience and foreign policy expertise.
He is not known for his rhetorical flourishes, yet he is well
regarded as a debater and a trusted partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney has proven himself a leader of national and
international stature,'' said Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif., who was
once considered a potential Bush running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quality guy in every respect. ... He commands respect
instantly,'' said Ken Khachigian, the California Republican
political adviser who worked with Cheney in the Nixon
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Kvamme, one of Silicon Valley's most politically active
executives, who met with Bush last week at a high tech summit,
called the choice of Cheney ``terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a good, strong knowledgeable vice president who
understands foreign policy is an extremely important attribute for
us,'' Kvamme said of the tech community. ``I think Silicon Valley
will react very, very well.'' Pitney said his former boss was
``very businesslike,'' not one for small talk, and someone who
commanded great loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   In a period of several months, Cheney went from the man leading
Bush's search for a vice president to Bush's choice. ``My hunch is
that Bush kept stacking up all the competitors against Cheney
himself,'' Pitney said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's record in Congress will please conservatives but may
cause trouble for Bush's efforts to win moderate swing voters. Even
before Bush offered the post to Cheney, interest groups began
faxing reporters examples of Cheney's right-wing record which they
said cast doubt on Bush's claim to be a ``compassionate
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, state Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres said
Cheney's record will hand Democrats ``an opportunity to talk about
a woman's right to choose and the environment, which is so
important (here),'' he said. ``Do we want a guy who ran an oil
company when we're trying to protect our coastline?''
</P>
<P>
   And as far as Cheney's ability to reach crucial Latino voters,
he said, ``about the only Latinos these two guys see are at the
country club bussing their dishes in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-choice advocates wasted no time in lambasting what they
called Cheney's ``fervently anti-choice'' record in his 11-year
stint in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that the big tent just closed. The flap has been
zipped shut,'' said Alice Germond, executive vice president of the
Washington D.C. based National Abortion Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   Germond said that in 26 out of 27 of House votes on abortion,
Cheney's anti-choice positions included supporting bans of federal
funding for poor women, U.S. servicewomen and army dependents
seeking abortion, even in cases of rape, incest or life of the
mother. And he supported legislation to prohibit women enrolled in
federal health plans from choosing insurance companies that
provided abortion coverage, even in those extreme cases, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clear message of where Bush himself really stands,
where the GOP stands,'' she said. ``All the flirtations of being
moderate and compassionate were merely that. It was an attempt to
deceive the moderate pro-choice voter.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists also decried the Cheney nomination. The League
of Conservation Voters said Cheney has a 13 percent lifetime
environmental voting record. Robert Cox, president of the Sierra
Club, said he was disappointed Bush would choose a running mate
with ``a dirty record.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, the Sierra Club said in a release, voted to sustain
President Ronald Reagan's veto of the Clean Water Act, against
citizens' rights to sue polluters, and had a zero percent
environmental voting record in 1989 _ his last year in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding Cheney to Bush's ticket would make a bad situation for
the environment worse,'' said Cox. ``A Bush-Cheney ticket would be
just what the oil industry wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats displayed no shyness in bringing up Cheney's health
problems, which include three mild heart attacks and quadruple
bypass surgery in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cheney advance people might want to purchase some smelling
salts,'' said Bob Mulholland, a consultant to the California
Democratic Party. ``They're going to need jumper cables with him
everywhere they go.''

NOISY PROTEST GREETS PHILIPPINE PRESIDENT IN SAN FRANCISCO
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By BENJAMIN PIMENTEL, MARK MARTIN and CHUCK SQUATRIGLIA 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada's first
official visit to America was met Monda night by a crowd of
boisterous protesters who gathered outside his San Francisco hotel
to demand an end to his nation's war against Muslim insurgents.
<P>
   Estrada received a warm welcome from a sympathetic audience
dining on filet mignon and portobello mushrooms at the Fairmont
Hotel, a counterpoint to the protesters outside who denounced the
corruption, war and political instability they claim he has brought
to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada, 63, is visiting the United States this week to ask
President Clinton for more military aid and to urge Silicon Valley
firms _ including Intel, Oracle and Sun Microsystems _ to set up
shop in the Southeast Asian nation he has led since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear last night if Estrada saw or heard the 200
demonstrators when his entourage arrived at the Fairmont in four
buses shortly after 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters said the prosperity that Estrada's predecessor, Fidel
Ramos, brought to the Philippines has waned over the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came from there,'' said demonstrator Rudy Sacatlang,
65, who recently moved to San Lorenzo from the Philippines. ``Life
is so hard there. Investors are moving out because they are afraid.
There's no stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacatlang and other protesters chanted anti-Estrada slogans in
English and Tagalog as they marched up Powell Street to the
Fairmont.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine president ignored his critics, whom police kept
behind barricades across the street, as he entered the hotel to
deliver a speech. He was expected to defend his campaign against
the Muslim rebels and extol the benefits of investing in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   His speech was a warmup for Tuesday's main event: lunch with
Silicon Valley executives Estrada desperately wants to invest in
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its high-tech industry, the Bay Area is important
to Estrada because it is home to more than a quarter-million
Filipinos. But many of them are disturbed by the way the one-time
movie star is running their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue Estrada has made a mess of the Philippine economy.
</P>
<P>
   Although inflation has fallen and the nation's gross domestic
product has climbed under Estrada's watch, unemployment stands at
13.9 percent _ the highest level in nine years _ and one-third of
the nation's 80 million people live in extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Their plight was highlighted two weeks ago when more than 200
people were killed in Manila after a gargantuan heap of garbage
where they eked out a meager living collapsed in an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada, who came to office amid vows to help the poor, also has
been dogged by allegations of corruption and cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   But it is his ongoing war against the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, a rebel army fighting for an independent Muslim state on the
Philippine island of Mindanao, that most troubles his critics in
the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's shown that he's completely inept at addressing the needs
of the people,'' said protester Rhonda Ramiro of the Committee for
Human Rights in the Philippines. ``Housing, jobs and health care
are what he should be addressing, not military spending.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving San Francisco Tuesday evening, Estrada will travel
to Washington, D.C., to ask President Clinton for more military aid
_ needed, in part, to sustain his administration's campaign against
the Moro rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have indicated Estrada will get the
money he is after because, as one administration official put it,
the Philippines ``are our good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Fairmont, Estrada's supporters defended the president
but called on him to make peace with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think President Estrada should work on making peace in
Mindanao,'' said Carmelo Rocco, a Filipino American physician in
San Francisco. ``We don't want a Jihad.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada's administration has argued that the negative reports
about their work are unfair and inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada's press secretary, Ricardo Puno, noted that the
country's economic woes are largely rooted in the Asian financial
crisis that began in 1997. The collapse of Southeast Asian
currencies began a flight of capital and a downturn from which the
region is still trying to recover, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Puno dismissed accusations of government corruption as
unfounded, and he defended the military operation against the Moro
rebels in the south as a campaign to protect Philippine
sovereignty.

LITTLE THINGS MEAN A LOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Mark Grudzielanek failed to get a bunt down Sunday.
Third baseman Adrian Beltre made an error when he rushed a throw
and Alex Cora booted a ball in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers won that one, but the Dodgers aren't
doing enough of the little things, and that's what manager Davey
Johnson said must change now that the club is in a playoff race.
Not coincidentally, it's the little things management was harping
on when Johnson was criticized during the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half is jockeying to try to solve some problems, get
everybody on track, solidify roles and be positioned to play at a
championship level,'' Johnson said. ``Those are things we have to
get a little bit better at. There's still inexperience. We still
make some mistakes that can cost us, that have cost us. This road
trip, this should be fun. We're in position. We're in a pennant
race. It's who can execute.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers began their 10-game road trip Monday four games
behind National League West-leading Arizona and 2 games behind San
Francisco in the wild-card standings.
</P>
<P>
   However, one thing the Dodgers must solidify is their lineup,
which has been in flux because of the injury to catcher Todd
Hundley, the illness of Grudzielanek and the erratic batting of
Todd Hollandsworth, who was yanked from the leadoff spot and
replaced by Cora.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Devon White should help the leadoff spot, but the
Dodgers need more production from the bottom of the order. No. 6
hitter Adrian Beltre is 5 for 30 (.167) with six RBI with runners
in scoring position in the last month. Cora, who usually bats
eighth, is batting .172 (10 for 58) in his past 19 games. His
average has dropped to .244 and he has one RBI since June 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is when it gets really fun to come to the ballpark,''
Johnson said. ``The every-day lineup needs to come together a
little more.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Easing Devo back: Activated Sunday, White returned to the
Dodgers lineup Monday after missing 71 games with a partially torn
left rotator cuff. White batted leadoff and had in infield single
in his first plate appearance. The center fielder was on base three
times in five plate appearances and scored once.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's yet to be decided how much White will play.
Johnson said he will check in with White daily to monitor the
outfielder's health, but White's intentions are clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm feeling ready to play, if I feel I can play every day,
so be it,'' White said. ``I missed 2 months. I look at it as my
turn to be healthy, and as long as I'm doing the job, I expect to
be in there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Right-hander Gregg Olson is expected to be
activated soon, possibly by the end of the four-game series against
Colorado. The Dodgers are debating whether to send lefty Onan
Masaoka to Triple-A Albuquerque or go back to 12 pitchers and
option out Chris Donnels. . . . Utility outfielder F.P. Santangelo,
on the 15-day disabled list with a left hand contusion, began a
rehab assignment with Single-A San Bernardino and went 0 for 1 with
a walk. He's not eligible to be activated until Aug. 1, but at that
time Santangelo has to serve his five-game suspension. But going to
San Bernardino now is more to get his swing in line. Santangelo is
hitting .183. . . . Left fielder Gary Sheffield's hearing for his
appeal of a five-game suspension is tentatively set for Aug. 29 in
Milwaukee. . . . While Johnson reiterated catcher Todd Hundley
might be lost for another week to 10 days with his broken right
thumb, Hundley said he threw a little Sunday and is hoping to
return at the end of the week. . . . Jason Repko, the Dodgers' top
pick in 1999 who was at short-season Great Falls (Mont.), is out
for the season with a back injury. The club's 2000 No. 1 pick, Ben
Diggins, a pitcher from the University of Arizona, remains
unsigned.

HOMICIDES, SUICIDES THE BIGGER KILLERS IN COUNTY &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles County residents have been more likely
to die a violent death than an accidental death, according to a
county report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, titled The Health of Angelenos, also found that the
county's birth rate has fallen steadily from a high of 22.9 births
per 1,000 residents in 1990 to 17 births per 1,000 in 1997, largely
the result of changing birth patterns among immigrants, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report, analyzing data from 1990 to 1998, was conducted to
help the county reduce health disparities between racial and ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most surprising findings was that intentional
injuries _ homicides and suicides _ accounted for 54 percent of all
injury deaths, as compared to 46 percent of injury deaths resulting
from accidents, including motor vehicle crashes, poisonings and
falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a concern,'' county Health Officer Dr. Jonathan E.
Fielding said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police Sgt John Pasquariello said the city has
experienced a recent spike in violent crime, mainly a result of
gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're addressing those issues,'' he said. ``Crime is up
lately, but it's been down historically over the last 10 years.
People tend to forget that 10 years ago we had almost 1,000
homicides a year and now we're down to less than 500.''
</P>
<P>
   Fielding attributed the high rate of violent deaths to the
availability of guns and the growth of the young adult population.
``Certainly, you have to relate those kinds of numbers to concerns
in the educational system and job opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Fielding said the dropping birthrates are a result of a
reduction in teen-age pregnancies and recent immigrants adapting to
American culture and having fewer children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The norm here is a smaller number of children, and we have
lower rates of illness and death among children than those other
places,'' he said. ``That generally leads over time to a lowering
of birthrates.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that 30 percent of Latinos, 27 percent of
Asians and Pacific Islanders, 18 percent of African-Americans and
12 percent of whites consider their health to be fair or poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a good predictor of how healthy people are and their
mortality risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that half of the adults in the county are
obese.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a growing epidemic,'' Fielding said. ``The point is
that excess weight increases risks for many serious diseases and is
a major cause of mortality. We need to really sound the alarm
bell.''
</P>
<P>
   Fielding said the increase in obesity is related to the fact
that 20 percent of men and 23 percent of women in the state do not
exercise outside of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older you get, the more important exercise gets in terms
of overall health maintenance,'' Fielding said. ``If you don't
start a pattern of exercise early in life, it's much less likely
you'll continue to exercise throughout your life.''

RODRIGUEZ HURT IN ANGELS WIN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Tex. _ In a sense, Mo Vaughn passed the baton to Ivan
Rodriguez, one former MVP to another. Only Vaughn did it with such
force that Rodriguez will miss the rest of the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the 1999 American League MVP and nine-time All-Star
catcher, suffered a broken bone in his right thumb and will have
surgery today. His right hand hit Vaughn's bat during the
follow-through of a throw to second base in the first inning of the
Anaheim Angels' bizarre 6-5, 12-inning win Monday night over the
Texas Rangers before 33,201 at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   As Kevin Stocker tried to steal second, Vaughn swung and missed
at strike three. And, as he often does, Vaughn fell toward the
plate during the follow-through of his swing, leading to the
contact with Rodriguez's hand. The break _ at the base of the first
metacarpal bone _ was discovered by X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I hit it, my finger went numb,'' Rodriguez said.
``I didn't feel anything and it started to swell up. From that
moment I just knew it was broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happens when a team's not going good,'' Rodriguez
added. ``Bad things happen. What can you do but get ready for
spring training next year.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened with Rodriguez might have been a freak play, but
it was nothing compared to the strange 10th inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were one strike away from losing in the ninth when
Scott Spiezio hit a two-run homer off Rangers closer John Wetteland
at 5. But in the 10th, the Rangers were in good position to win it,
putting runners on second and third with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Darin Erstad was brought in to form a five-man
infield, playing on the second baseman's side of second base.
</P>
<P>
   With the count 1-1 to Gabe Kapler, home-plate umpire Gerry Davis
called a balk on Angels pitcher Shigetoshi Hasegawa. Scarborough
Green raced in from third and the Rangers celebrated a victory.
</P>
<P>
   But the normally mild-mannered Hasegawa argued vehemently.
Angels manager Mike Scioscia stormed out of the dugout to argue,
too, and soon after the four umpires talked it over. After a few
minutes, the umpires waved both teams back on the field and
reversed the balk call.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler then popped out to the catcher, Erstad moved back to left
field, and after an intentional walk to Mike Lamb, Hasegawa got
Royce Clayton on a fly to center for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa (7-2) got the win with three scoreless innings. Tim
Salmon's two-out RBI single in the 12th scored Adam Kennedy with
what turned out to be the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Monday's outcome, the Rangers' season has been a
disappointment. They've been in last place most of the season, and
now with Rodriguez out, there could be some big changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people have had their hands on the plug, and
they just haven't yanked it,'' Rangers GM Doug Melvin said. ``This
is a veteran club. We can't feel sorry for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he didn't blame Vaughn for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' Rodriguez said. ``Mo is a very clean player. He
plays the game good. I don't think it was on purpose. He swung the
bat and it crossed the plate. It happens to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Vaughn, the American League's MVP in 1995, who was slowed
all of last season after injuring his left ankle on opening night.
He's never had a strikeout carry so much impact as Monday's. Vaughn
called the Rangers dugout during the game and ``wasn't feeling very
good'' when he heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have had their share of injuries this season,
including losing outfielder Ruben Mateo and pitcher Justin Thompson
for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a year where the doctors have had more press
conferences than me,'' Melvin said. ``We all have injuries . . .
you almost take Pudge for granted, that he'll always be out there.
You have to realize it could happen to anyone.''

   There's plenty of cutting-edge conservative thought on the
National Review Online site as well as the kind of tireless Clinton
watchdoggerel you'd expect plus movie reviews (''If you are easily
offended, (beginitalic)Scary Movie (enditalic)is not the film for
you'') and a clumsy link to electronic-commerce opportunities. Upon
discovering which, we felt immediately compelled to drop everything
and shop for - what else? - a not-too-loud necktie. The very first
selection offered us by the National Review Online Marketplace,
however, came from the Jerry Garcia Collection, and that freaked us
so far out that we had to quit and do freestyle spins around the
room for a couple of hours. But not before discovering another
nifty aspect of the site, Bill Buckley's Word of the Day, a daily
interactive vocabulary-building game, which we aced on the first
try by picking Answer C, ``Strictures,'' as the perfect fit for the
definition ``the demands, restrictions, requirements of.'' Proving
that we remain world-class guessers at multiple-choice questions.

   This regional delight has been getting positive publicity in

depending) want a copy. The annual music issue includes
passion-packed writing about such Southern lights as Dolly Parton,
Doc Watson, Tom Petty and Big Mama Thornton. A few not-so-Southern

interesting articles involve such pre-e technologies as blimps and

suffered a bit of a downturn since the Hindenburg unpleasantness.
The second hits the beach at Alang, India, where supertankers are

   Astros finally win third in a row
</P>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ With victories so hard to come by this season, the
Astros won't soon forget Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Playing one of their most inspired games, the Astros extended
their winning streak to a season-high three with a 7-5
come-from-behind victory over the Cincinnati Reds at Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was clearly the biggest win of the year for us,'' manager
Larry Dierker said after the Astros rallied from a three-run
deficit to pull out the victory in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing 5-2, the Astros scored two runs in the sixth, one
in the ninth and two in the 10th. Glen Barker hit an RBI single
with two out in the top of the 10th to put the Astros ahead, and
Bill Spiers added a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was huge. There are so many positives to say about this
game,'' said Astros outfielder Lance Berkman, who tied the game at
5 in the ninth with a sacrifice fly. ``This was really the first
time we put it all together _ solid pitching, clutch hitting and
good defense.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no shortage of heroes Monday:
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' bullpen, in relief of starter Chris Holt, combined
to hold the Reds scoreless over the final five innings. Octavio
Dotel picked up his first victory since May 1 with two perfect
innings of relief, which included four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Like Barker, Matt Mieske came off the bench and delivered a
clutch two-out single. Mieske's hit in the sixth drove in two runs
to pull the Astros within 5-4. Entering the game, Astros pinch
hitters were hitting an anemic .141.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, Berkman gunned down Ken Griffey Jr. when he tried to
stretch a single into a double. Second baseman Craig Biggio, who
went 3-for-6, made a diving grab of a grounder toward the hole to
rob Griffey. And Richard Hidalgo made a catch as he crashed into
the wall in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is in a great mood,'' said Berkman, who tied a
career high with three hits. ``It's really a mood we haven't seen
in the clubhouse in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning the final two games of their weekend series with
National League Central-leading St. Louis, the Astros became the
last team in the majors this season to win three straight games,
the victory coming in their 99th game of the season. The last team
to go that deep into the season without winning three games in a
row was the 1985 Pittsburgh Pirates, who didn't win three straight
until their 145th game.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros appeared headed for another loss after the Reds
erased a pair of bases-empty home runs by Biggio and Hidalgo to go
ahead 5-2. Sean Casey delivered a two-run single in the fourth,
extending his hitting streak to 16 games, and Griffey provided a
three-run triple in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Houston slowly chipped away at the lead. Mieske, who pinch-hit
for Holt, hit a two-run single to left off Dennys Reyes, pulling
the Astros within 5-4. Berkman forced extra innings with a
sacrifice fly to center field off Danny Graves (9-2) with one out
in the ninth. It marked the first blown save for the Reds' bullpen
since June 21, snapping a streak of nine straight successful save
conversions.
</P>
<P>
   In he 10th, Mitch Meluskey hit a one-out double, and Barker
worked the count before sending a 2-2 pitch from Graves through the
hole at second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't get many at-bats, you have to go out and
scramble and put the ball in play,'' Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers followed with a single to almost the exact same location,
driving in the Astros' final run. In the last two games, Spiers is
5-for-11 with seven RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel (2-5), who was moved from the starting rotation to the
bullpen on July 4, retired all six batters he faced, recording the
final out when Alex Ochoa popped out in foul territory behind home
plate. Dotel has yet to allow a run in seven relief appearances
covering eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go out there thinking a different way. I'm a closer now,''
said Dotel, who took over that duty for injured lefthander Billy
Wagner. ``My job is to try and keep the game close and give the
team a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in 10 days, Biggio came up a triple short of
the cycle. He homered in the first, doubled in the third and
singled in the fifth. He grounded to third and struck out in his
final two at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the first, Biggio hit his seventh home run into
the right-field corner. Hidalgo added a no-doubter to left-center
in the fourth inning _ No. 29 on the season _ and is one homer away
from becoming only the fifth player in club history to reach 30 in
a single season. The club record is 43, set by Jeff Bagwell in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who rank second in the National League with 149
homers, have hit eight over the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   After winning three straight division titles, the Astros now
find themselves trying to play the spoiler's role in the final two
months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the character of the guys here to not quit and keep
playing hard,'' Biggio said. ``It's unfortunate our record is what
it is, but the least we can do is go out and give 100 percent.''
</P>

GILLICK WILL GET PLAYERS, NOT PLAYED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Pat Gillick emerged from his office around 5 p.m.,
another round of cat-and-mouse complete.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Mariners general manager calls this countdown to
Monday's trading deadline a poker game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like ... who's going to blink first?'' Gillick
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For clubs who have players that are attractive, you can't
blame them for trying to make the best deal possible. We have to
somewhat overpay, but we can't get completely scammed.''
</P>
<P>
   No, you can't. And you can't go too far down the road with one
deal, only to reach a dead end. And you can't waste time being
played for the fool.
</P>
<P>
   Mets GM Steve Phillips must be feeling that way. After thinking
New York had a shot at renting Barry Larkin, Phillips was left at
the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Reds GM Jim Bowden played the Mets to perfection, getting fans
in Cincinnati to cry over Larkin _ a formula that embarrassed Reds
owner Carl Lindner into signing the All-Star shortstop to the same
$27 million deal the Reds weren't willing to make until Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of mess won't take place in Seattle this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we heard about the Mets and Reds. Pat would be harder to
get into that kind of situation. He's pretty aware of the issues
involved,'' said Roger Jongewaard, Mariners VP of scouting and
player development.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus around baseball is that whatever deal or deals
Gillick makes in the next seven days, he won't be the one who gets
played.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to fry bigger fish than I have to offer him. He's
going for the big strike, and I don't have position players,''
Dodgers GM Kevin Malone said Monday from L.A., where Malone is
trying to upgrade his team.
</P>
<P>
   From their days together in Baltimore, Malone said he would be
shocked if Gillick didn't make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he won't leave any stone unturned. He's built that team
around that ballpark. He did it quickly, and they've proved they
can win. No, it's about how to make them better,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   What Gillick did in Baltimore and Toronto, citizens of
Marinerville are right to anticipate here as well. The Mariners may
need only a role player _ a left-handed batter who can hit .280 and
won't strike out. But it appears Gillick is heading toward a bigger
deal, possibly two.
</P>
<P>
   When you're Gillick, the man who traded for Joe Carter and
Roberto Alomar and won two World Series, the pressure is on to
continue your tradition of blockbuster deals.
</P>
<P>
   No one who knows Gillick, or works with him, will downplay what
he is capable of doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat is probably the most passionate (GM in baseball). He has a
very creative mind,'' Jongewaard said. ``He talks baseball 24 hours
a day. He comes in, in the morning, with a whole bunch of new
ideas. He doesn't even write anything down. He memorizes phone
numbers, deals and comments. He just puts them in his computer
upstairs _ in his brain.''
</P>
<P>
   While former Mariners GM Woody Woodward was structured and
rigid, Gillick is fluid and inquisitive, and fully capable of
delegating to all his deputies in an effort that has energized the
Mariners' staff.
</P>
<P>
   While Woodward had no escape hatches in many of the deals he
started discussing, Gillick will pull out the second he senses the
other team has set the price too high.
</P>
<P>
   Remember 1998, when the Yankees and Indians tied Woodward up in
knots in bogus trade discussions about Randy Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   Woodward was led down the primrose path by the two American
League powerhouses. In the 11th hour, Woodward realized neither
team wanted to make the trade, and he was left to make the only
deal he had left, with Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Woodward was more lucky than good. The Mariners did
not get their first two choices, but Freddy Garcia, Carlos Guillen
and John Halama were excellent consolation prizes.
</P>
<P>
   It could have just as easily been as bad as the time Woodward
sent Jason Varitek and Derek Lowe to Boston for Heathcliff Slocumb
while Mariners fans wailed in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Mariners face a trading deadline in the same
position they did in 1995 and '97. They are contending, in a
position to push to improve.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, instead of merely having a shot at their
division, the Mariners are good enough to consider making deals
that give them a shot at representing the AL in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with pitching, the Mariners head to the deadline in a
position of strength for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this strength has not opened the door for a pre-deadline
deal. Prices are too high, Mariners officials say, and Gillick has
his eye not just on 2000, but 2001 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   If Mariners manager Lou Piniella has clamored for a deal with
Kansas City for Johnny Damon, the left-handed bat the Mariners
need, it is Gillick who has refused to be bullied into paying the
asking price of Ryan Anderson, Joel Pineiro and/or Gil Meche.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what our priorities are,'' Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the buildup to the trading deadline, this is not his
favorite week in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to try and keep everything focused. Sometimes, other
people don't really (hold the line on reasonable trades) and are
willing to probably give a lot more than they should,'' Gillick
said. ``There are certain situations where you're going to give
more than you anticipated, but you can't get ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Cat-and-mouse. Poker. Whatever. Gillick is playing the game.

some people here are openly challenging the portrait of Strong as a

DODGERS EARN WIN AND A LITTLE PAYBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Manager Davey Johnson and left fielder Gary Sheffield
said it was just one of those pitches that happened to slip, a
Kevin Brown fastball that drilled Colorado's Todd Helton in the
back.
</P>
<P>
   It came an inning after Sheffield, already with a double,
triple, homer and three RBI, was plunked in the back Colorado's
Julian Tavarez.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was Brown watching Sheffield's back. Or perhaps it was
just coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever it was, it added a bit of theatrics in a pair of
sublime solo performances by Brown and Sheffield, who combined to
lift the Los Angeles Dodgers past the Rockies 4-1 Monday at Coors
Field to open a 10-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (10-3) allowed three hits and one run in eight innings,
and taunted the altitude by getting 16 outs via ground balls in a
ballpark known for fly balls. Brown didn't allow a hit until Todd
Walker's one-out triple in the third, ending a string of 11 innings
in which he didn't allow a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters had a scare in the ninth when the Rockies had
back-to-back singles with one out, but he retired Helton and Brent
Mayne for his fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference pitching (at Coors Field), but you can't
let it affect you, you can't let it beat you before you walk out
there,'' Brown said. ``You have to make adjustments. You have to
expect your ball to move differently and you have to plan for that.
You can't throw the breaking balls that start off high and expect
them to still break. You have to start off lower. Just little
things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's triple in the first inning gave the Dodgers a 1-0
lead. He doubled in a run in the third to make it 2-0, and his
major league-leading 34th homer in the fifth gave the Dodgers a 3-0
lead. An RBI single by Shawn Green in the seventh accounted for the
Dodgers' fourth run.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's lone run came via Butch Huskey's homer in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brownie's just awesome. He's not necessarily going hard all
the time, but putting a lot of movement on the ball,'' Johnson
said. ``That effort in this ballpark is just unbelievable.
(Sheffield) had the tough part of the cycle and then he gets
drilled in the back and then they don't even come close to pitching
to him. The Sheff and Brownie Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, in theory, had a chance to join Wes Parker (1970) as
the only Los Angeles Dodger to hit for the cycle, but he never got
a real chance.
</P>
<P>
   Having battered starter Rolando Arrojo around Coors Field,
Sheffield was hit in the middle of the back in the seventh inning
by Tavarez's first pitch. Sheffield said it knocked the air out of
him.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, Brown retired Jeff Cirillo on a fly
ball to center field and hit Helton in the middle of the back with
his first pitch. Home-plate umpire Jeff Kellogg warned both
benches, but Colorado manager Buddy Bell argued, stating Brown
intentionally threw at Helton.
</P>
<P>
   As a chorus of boos rained upon Brown, he calmly got Mayne to
ground into a double play to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sheffield) is seeing the ball well, he's staying center and
he's hitting pitches,'' said second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, who
scored the Dodgers' first two runs. ``You don't like to see (the
beanball) stuff. The last thing we need to do is have a brawl with
these guys, but on the other hand, I can understand Brownie's
reaction toward it. That's baseball. That's the way it's going to
be and you have to protect your guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's final chance at the cycle, in hindsight, really
wasn't that much of an opportunity. Sheffield, who leads the
Dodgers with a .342 average and 84 RBI, led off the ninth and was
walked on four not-even-close pitches by reliever Bobby Chouinard.

MOYER MASTERS ATHLETICS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariners opened the evening by getting another big
performance from a guy who has earned a reputation as a big-game
pitcher, Jamie Moyer.
</P>
<P>
   They the night three hours, 31 minutes later by getting a big
performance from a guy who is earning the same kind of reputation,
Kazuhiro Sasaki.
</P>
<P>
   After Moyer held down Oakland as the Mariners carved out a 6-3
lead, Sasaki took over in the ninth inning and, despite allowing a
run, put away the Athletics in dramatic style, striking out Oakland
homer and RBI leader Jason Giambi on with a laser fastball, for a
6-4 Mariners victory last night.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, Sasaki had thrown exactly what catcher Joe Oliver
had called for. Forkball. Followed by forkball. Followed by
forkball. Each of the first eight pitches was a forkball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to throw the fastball,'' Sasaki said, aware that
Giambi is one of the game's best dead fastball hitters. ``I knew
sooner or later Joe would call it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Oliver did that, with a runner at second and two out
and a 3-2 count on Giambi, the almost full Safeco Field crowd had
just about screamed itself hoarse. But there were enough nerve
endings left in the larynx to give forth one more roar as Sasaki
blasted a called third strike past Giambi for his 14th consecutive
save row (24th overall), tying Mike Timlin's 1998 club record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up a walk and a run,'' Sasaki said. ``I wanted to show
the fans my good pitches. I put a lot of feeling into it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, did Moyer, now 11-3 after beating the A's for the sixth
consecutive time and the second time in a week.
</P>
<P>
   There are many pitchers with bigger pitches than Moyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will insist, however, there aren't many pitchers
with a bigger heart.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the soft-throwing, hard-working Moyer came up with a
win in the important first game of a series with second-place
Oakland. The victory stretched the Mariners' lead in the American
League West to five games over the A's and also over Anaheim, which
beat Texas to move into a tie for the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oakland makes you work for whatever you get,'' Moyer said.
``They've got a good club, and they can really drive the ball. The
key to beating them is to keep away from the big inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what Moyer did, giving up a two-run single to
Ryan Christenson in the fifth inning that made it 5-3 but otherwise
keeping the cantankerous Oakland bats in check.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly Moyer threw changeups. And mostly the A's either missed
them or didn't hit them with any authority.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the runs off Moyer were earned.
</P>
<P>
   Picked up by Seattle in the middle of the 1996 season, Moyer is
57-25 since the start of the 1997 season and 63-27 overall as a
Mariner. Small wonder then that manager Lou Piniella went out of
his way to set up his rotation so that the 37-year-old lefty would
face Oakland twice in a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie pitched a nice game,'' Piniella said, ``especially
having to pitch against that club the second time around.''
</P>
<P>
   On a night when shortstop Alex Rodriguez, out since July 7, was
activated and eligible to pinch-hit, the Mariners didn't need him.
They scored five runs in the first four innings against Appier,
then added one run late to put the game in the win column.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Alex ready,'' Piniella said. ``I'm glad we didn't have
to use him, though. I wanted to wait one more day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners got a big home run from Edgar Martinez, his 25th,
in the fourth inning, then added a bottom-of-the-eighth run on a
Mike Cameron single and stolen base, then an RBI hit by David Bell,
all of which helped Moyer keep his mastery over the A's intact..
</P>
<P>
   Moyer opened the game by pitching into the fourth inning without
allowing a hit. He gave up a couple of hits in the fourth, but it
was an error by third baseman David Bell that allowed an unearned
run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Two more runs came across in the fifth on a two-out hit by
Christenson, but by that time, the Mariners had built up a 5-1
lead, so the damage wasn't too severe.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer lasted until the seventh, when A's shortstop Miguel Tejada
beat out an infield grounder, leading Piniella to go to his
bullpen. Although Jose Paniagua surrendered a walk and was
replaced, Arthur Rhodes pitched 12/3 impressive innings of relief,
then turned the ball over to Sasaki in the ninth.

 &HT;    People in 20s, 30s seem more financially astute
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The stores are jammed with personal finance books, but
not many are tailored for young people.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that financial beginners don't have much money and
don't cause a lot of stir in the marketplace. Another reason may be
that young people haven't shown a great deal of interest in the
discipline, delayed gratification and long-term thinking that are
essential to building a financial stake.
</P>
<P>
   Those things may be changing. Studies suggest that people in
their 20s and 30s are saving and investing more these days.
</P>
<P>
   Author Beth Kobliner _ 35 years old and already an old hand in
the financial advice trade _ adds that the young are more alert to
the financial side of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a dramatic learning curve in the last few
years,'' Kobliner said in a recent interview. ``Four years ago,
when I wrote my first book, I had to explain what a mutual fund is.
Now pretty much everybody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobliner passed through Atlanta recently to talk up the newly
published second edition of her best seller, ``Get a Financial
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are highlights from an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you think young people are better informed? Is there a
sense of increased responsibility?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, there are all these 24-hour financial shows on cable
TV. I was on jury duty in New York a few months ago. We were right
near Little Italy. In all these little cafes, they had CNBC on.
There are now literally thousands of investing Web sites. People
are researching, but in many cases they haven't seen the big
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do 401(k)s make people more responsible?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's one factor. Also, there is more of a sense that if you
don't do this, you're missing out on an opportunity. That's why
young people are trying to put at least a little money away. With
that, they have to make decisions _ stocks, bonds or a mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a lot of people in their 20s and 30s have credit cards.
The average credit card debt for young people is $2,500. Then you
can add $10,000 to $12,000 for student loans. So they are forced to
pay attention to their finances.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the boom in stocks made a difference?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the last 10 years, the market has quadrupled. Even if you
weren't investing, you would notice by osmosis that things have
changed. Students tell me, ``My roommate has a beeper, and his
broker is always calling him.''
</P>
<P>
   The money thing is much more a part of the zeitgeist of our
times. Even on TV shows, like ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
There's a lot of orientation towards money.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you say this generation is nervous about their money?
Or are they more greedy? What's their emotional relationship with
money?
</P>
<P>
   A: The media has portrayed these young people as movers and
shakers _ young people getting into dot-com jobs and making more
money right out of college than their parents did. The reality is
different. Young people, on average, are earning less than people
of their age group in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 percent, the ones who get science degrees or graduate
from the top schools, they're doing dramatically better. I think
there's a sense among that top 10 percent that the sky is the
limit. They are maxed out in their 401(k)s. They're interested in
investing.
</P>
<P>
   But a large chunk of young people don't do as well as their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   That group is kind of hoping to be lifted with the tide, but a
lot of them feel they've missed the boat. There was a poll recently
that showed 82 percent of young people feel they have benefited
little or not at all from the stock market boom.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the greatest concerns you hear?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lot of young people have heavy debt and don't know how
they're going to get out of it. They're struggling to pay their
bills. There's a concern about how they're going to get out of
debt, and, after that, how they are ever going to save any money.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can they cope?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you're carrying credit card debt and student loans, credit
cards generally are charging you higher rates. Paying off those
high-rate card debts first makes sense, particularly now that the
interest on student loans is deductible. With the deduction, you
change the effective rate from 8 percent to an effective rate of
about 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How about rainy-day savings?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm a real believer in having an emergency fund, having
enough to pay your living expenses for at least three months. After
that, I think it makes the most sense to pay off those higher-rate
debts first.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's next?
</P>
<P>
   A: If they have 401(k)s with a matching feature, they have a
tremendous investment opportunity. Some companies say, ``For every
dollar you put in, (we'll) put in 50 cents or a dollar.'' That's an
immediate return on your money.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Clearly some people aren't making much money, and putting
aside even $5 a day would be a problem. What do you say to them?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lot of young people say, ``I don't have any money to
save.'' But the reality is that when you're in your 20s, that's
when you have the fewest obligations. You don't have kids. You
don't have a home, generally. This is a very good time to scale
back a little here and there. It's so much easier than it will be
in your 30s and 40s. People think they'll get around to it when
they have more money. The reality is you'll never get around to it
until you make yourself.
</P>
<P>
   You get a raise every year, and often it's higher than the cost
of living. If it beats the cost of living, you have extra money
that you didn't have last year. You can just have the money taken
out of your checking account before you touch it. Even if it's just
$25 a month, you can put it into some sort of stock fund and you'll
never have to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you recommend for starter investments?
</P>
<P>
   A: You could begin with money market mutual funds to build your
emergency cushion, then move up to index funds. It seems to me it's
really hard to argue with index funds, particularly for people who
don't want to spend their lives looking at their investments. A lot
of people don't care that much. They just want to make sure they do
a little better than inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Somewhere in all this, don't you need an overall financial
plan?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, you can build your emergency fund, pay off high-rate
debt and get into a 401(k), if you can.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get beyond that, you can ask, ``What do I want from
life?''
</P>
<P>
   PAYING YOUR DEBTS
</P>
<P>
   How many months it will take to pay off credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
   How it works: Estimate what percentage of your debt you can pay
each month on your existing debt.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you owe $1,000 and can afford to pay $30 a
month, your payment will be 3 percent. Look down the left column to
find the percentage that works for you.
</P>
<P>
   Scan across the top row and find the annual interest rate
imposed by your credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Read across from the percent you can pay and down from the
interest rate on your card. At the intersection is the number of
months it will take to pay your bill.

 &HT;    People in 20s, 30s seem more financially astute
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The stores are jammed with personal finance books, but
not many are tailored for young people.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that financial beginners don't have much money and
don't cause a lot of stir in the marketplace. Another reason may be
that young people haven't shown a great deal of interest in the
discipline, delayed gratification and long-term thinking that are
essential to building a financial stake.
</P>
<P>
   Those things may be changing. Studies suggest that people in
their 20s and 30s are saving and investing more these days.
</P>
<P>
   Author Beth Kobliner _ 35 years old and already an old hand in
the financial advice trade _ adds that the young are more alert to
the financial side of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a dramatic learning curve in the last few
years,'' Kobliner said in a recent interview. ``Four years ago,
when I wrote my first book, I had to explain what a mutual fund is.
Now pretty much everybody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobliner passed through Atlanta recently to talk up the newly
published second edition of her best seller, ``Get a Financial
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are highlights from an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you think young people are better informed? Is there a
sense of increased responsibility?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, there are all these 24-hour financial shows on cable
TV. I was on jury duty in New York a few months ago. We were right
near Little Italy. In all these little cafes, they had CNBC on.
There are now literally thousands of investing Web sites. People
are researching, but in many cases they haven't seen the big
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do 401(k)s make people more responsible?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's one factor. Also, there is more of a sense that if you
don't do this, you're missing out on an opportunity. That's why
young people are trying to put at least a little money away. With
that, they have to make decisions _ stocks, bonds or a mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a lot of people in their 20s and 30s have credit cards.
The average credit card debt for young people is $2,500. Then you
can add $10,000 to $12,000 for student loans. So they are forced to
pay attention to their finances.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the boom in stocks made a difference?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the last 10 years, the market has quadrupled. Even if you
weren't investing, you would notice by osmosis that things have
changed. Students tell me, ``My roommate has a beeper, and his
broker is always calling him.''
</P>
<P>
   The money thing is much more a part of the zeitgeist of our
times. Even on TV shows, like ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
There's a lot of orientation towards money.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you say this generation is nervous about their money?
Or are they more greedy? What's their emotional relationship with
money?
</P>
<P>
   A: The media has portrayed these young people as movers and
shakers _ young people getting into dot-com jobs and making more
money right out of college than their parents did. The reality is
different. Young people, on average, are earning less than people
of their age group in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 percent, the ones who get science degrees or graduate
from the top schools, they're doing dramatically better. I think
there's a sense among that top 10 percent that the sky is the
limit. They are maxed out in their 401(k)s. They're interested in
investing.
</P>
<P>
   But a large chunk of young people don't do as well as their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   That group is kind of hoping to be lifted with the tide, but a
lot of them feel they've missed the boat. There was a poll recently
that showed 82 percent of young people feel they have benefited
little or not at all from the stock market boom.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the greatest concerns you hear?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lot of young people have heavy debt and don't know how
they're going to get out of it. They're struggling to pay their
bills. There's a concern about how they're going to get out of
debt, and, after that, how they are ever going to save any money.

cards generally are charging you higher rates. Paying off those
high-rate card debts first makes sense, particularly now that the
interest on student loans is deductible. With the deduction, you
change the effective rate from 8 percent to an effective rate of

 &HT;    All the lodge's a stage . . .
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PELEE ISLAND, Ont. _ Boy meets girl. Boy gets girls. Boy and
girl get married and open a bed and breakfast in the far north
boonies. Then one fine autumn morning, boy comes to breakfast
grumpy. Girl hasn't got a clue. He glowers. She
</P>
<P>
   chirps. That's where the play begins.
</P>
<P>
   Robin, Pat, and Sharon, my weekend island sisters, are sitting a
couple of rows ahead of me in the tiny, darkened theatre that, when
no one is treading the boards, doubles as the Masonic Lodge. The
stage is barely turning-around size _ just enough room for the
actors to get on, get off, and make their moves. They're using
every inch of it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the lights dimmed, I took a house count _ only 23 of the
60 or so chairs on the tiered platforms are filled. Maybe because
it's 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon. Or maybe it's because the
weather is stormy and the lake, being shallow, has a tendency to
toss boaters around like toys in a dishpan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Affections of May,'' the play bill proclaims, is a
``hilarious comedy'' in two acts.
</P>
<P>
   May is married to Brian _ he's the unhappy one with his chin
dragging in the oatmeal. May is, for the moment, the fatuously
cheerful one rattling inanely on about budgets and firewood. All is
right in her world _ except Brian.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon (we're sisters-in-law twice removed...divorced from
brothers) turns in the semi-darkness and gives me a knowing glance.
Brian is working his way up to a fast exit _ stage right because
he's had it with wood chopping and other
</P>
<P>
   things bucolic, and longs for the pace of the city they left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   May is shocked, once Brian finally gets through to her that he's
not kidding, but good wife that she is, she makes up her mind to
give up their dream and go with him. She's gonna' stand by her man.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not exactly what Brian has in mind. It takes almost
all of Scene 1 for May to catch on to what Brian is not saying.
There's another woman and he's not only leaving the budget, the
firewood, and the boonies, he's leaving May and her bib overalls.
</P>
<P>
   Exit Brian. Enter Quinn _ a hard-drinking, loose-living (in a
barn most recently) fellow looking for odd jobs and a place to
sleep. May needs help, not complications. But we all know that
without complications there'd be no plot.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn stays _ in the spare room.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon turns around giving me her eyebrow waggle that translates
to, ``AHA!''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Hank Beavis _ a banker nerd with trousers up to his
armpits and the body language of a question mark. Hank says he's
had his eye on May for a long time and now, since that sorry Brian
has cut and run, maybe she'd like to go to the town Halloween party
with him.
</P>
<P>
   May insists Brian's coming back, but goes anyway because Hank's
mom has already made his costume _ a six-foot pink rabbit complete
with ears, thumpers, and a giant carrot. May is going as Little Bo
Peep.
</P>
<P>
   The plot thickens

Mendelssohn's wedding march the way it's touting its ``end to the

measure through both Houses in time for the opening of the
Republican Convention next week. The president should veto the
measure. (The Atlanta Constitution). 9.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ ``The definition of insanity is doing the same
thing over and over and expecting different results.'' This wisdom
_ variously ascribed to Einstein, Unknown, Anonymous and other
great thinkers of our time _ would seem to fit the persistent Star
Wars delusion. The scaled-down version that the Pentagon and a slew
of contractors and their political hangers-on are pushing recently
failed its third test, the one ballyhooed as the most telling.
(Teepen, Cox News Service). MOVED.

<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ As if the Middle East negotiations weren't
tangled enough, the Vatican has decided to insert itself into this
most difficult of situations. Last weekend, Pope John Paul II has
suggested that Jerusalem, the heretofore unfixable sticking point
of any negotiations, be internationally controlled. It has a
familiar ring to it, a quite familiar ring. This is what was first
decided by the United Nations in November 1947 when Palestine was
partitioned into separate Jewish and Arab states with Jerusalem as
an international enclave. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service). MOVED.

Pensacola, Fla. _ When we saw that Perdido Key was included in the
ranking of top 20 American beaches compiled by the expert who bills
himself as ``Dr. Beach,'' we had to check it out. But when we found
it to be, in our humble estimation, less than award-winning, we
decided to see how it ranked among this Panhandle city's other fine
beaches. In this report, we're not claiming to be real Dr. Beaches,
we're just playing one. (Pousner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   EDITORIAL-MARRIAGETAX _ You'd think the GOP had rewritten
Mendelssohn's wedding march the way it's touting its ``end to the
marriage penalty'' proposal. Party leaders pushed the tax relief
measure through both Houses in time for the opening of the
Republican Convention next week. The president should veto the

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ ``The definition of insanity is doing the same
thing over and over and expecting different results.'' This wisdom
_ variously ascribed to Einstein, Unknown, Anonymous and other
great thinkers of our time _ would seem to fit the persistent Star
Wars delusion. The scaled-down version that the Pentagon and a slew
of contractors and their political hangers-on are pushing recently
failed its third test, the one ballyhooed as the most telling.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ As if the Middle East negotiations weren't
tangled enough, the Vatican has decided to insert itself into this
most difficult of situations. Last weekend, Pope John Paul II has
suggested that Jerusalem, the heretofore unfixable sticking point
of any negotiations, be internationally controlled. It has a
familiar ring to it, a quite familiar ring. This is what was first
decided by the United Nations in November 1947 when Palestine was
partitioned into separate Jewish and Arab states with Jerusalem as
an international enclave. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service). MOVED.

 &HT;    WITH FETE FOR HOFFA, GOP WORKING HARD FOR LABOR VOTERS
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Republicans got his sweat and his skill, but
Steve Bromiley kept his suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a 100 percent union city, and Republicans don't like
unions,'' said Bromiley, a carpenter helping convert the First
Union Center sports arena into a political hall for the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the guys building the place are Republicans,'' said
Bromiley, 35, a member of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and
Joiners. ``I don't know how they determined to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   But not only are the Republicans convening in a stronghold of
Democrats and organized labor, they are honoring Teamsters
President James Hoffa. Hoffa will attend the convention next week
and be the guest of honor at a reception hosted by the national
party chairman, Jim Nicholson, Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and a
group of congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Convention said it's the first time in
20 years that a union president has been feted at a GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   By inviting Hoffa, ``we're reaching out to a leading
representative of working families,'' said Nicholson. He said
Republicans, especially Ronald Reagan, have had considerable
support from rank-and-file union members in recent decades and are
now making connections with their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sign that we're willing to talk,'' said Rich Bond, a
Republican political strategist.
</P>
<P>
   And Hoffa's willingness to attend indicates that despite the
``hostilities'' of AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, ``some union
leaders are willing to do business with the Republican Party,''
said Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters spokesman Bret Caldwell said Hoffa's attendance shows
``his willingness to reach across party lines to help working
families'' and his commitment to ``electing a pro-labor Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   But Caldwell cautioned that ``it should not be construed as a
message to any presidential candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after the GOP convention ends, Hoffa will be a Michigan
delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Teamsters have not endorsed a presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoffa's silence speaks volumes about his enthusiasm for Al
Gore,'' said Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the vice president has not achieved the unified backing
from organized labor that most Democratic candidates have usually
wrapped up well before Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Teamsters, the United Auto Workers have so
far declined to join the AFL-CIO in endorsing Gore. Together, those
two unions represent about 2 million of the labor federation's 13
million members.
</P>
<P>
   Gore angered some labor leaders when he appointed former
Commerce Secretary William Daley, who led the administration effort
to open trade with China, as his campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa met with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, in April and later appeared on a
podium with Green Party candidate Ralph Nader. Caldwell said there
will be a ``scientific poll'' of the 1.5 million Teamsters members
before the union makes a presidential endorsement.

FRENCH LESSON IN GOING WIRELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The first sighting of this handy little device was not in
Boston or Silicon Valley. It was in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   We were nestled at a table at Ma Bourgogne, inches away from a
French couple, whose tiny dog lapped occasionally at her owner's
plate. (``Non, non, Penny!'' the lady quietly scolded.) It's the
kind of restaurant where waiters wear black vests and bowties, and
white aprons that hang to the floor. Grilled beef is bathed in wine
sauce, and the terrace overlooks Place des Vosges, home to French
kings and queens in the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until late in the evening, the '97 Chateauneuf du Pape
nearly finished, that we noticed: The waiter didn't jot patrons'
orders on a note pad. He punched buttons on a wireless gadget the
size of a Palm Pilot _ sending orders straight to the kitchen and
to a central computer. He swiped our credit card across the compact
machine right at the table to settle the bill.
</P>
<P>
   This, in the city of romance and Old World charm, yet not in
technology-obsessed Boston? Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, Americans are about as far behind in adopting this
kind of technology as we were with cell phones. Everyone in Europe
and Tokyo had a mobile phone glued to his or her ear a few years
ago; we've only recently followed suit. Wireless pros say it's been
easier to roll out services in Europe because digital
communications became the norm sooner, and countries there tend to
have one central system that everyone uses, while we have several.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be cultural reasons, too, for our slow embrace
of what seems a quintessentially American kind of efficiency tool.
As one restaurateur suggests, subtlety is hard to come by here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Paris, they're secure. They aren't trying to create an
experience,'' suggests Jim Miller, chief executive of Fire &AMP; Ice, a
popular Cambridge, Mass. restaurant. Meanwhile, in the States, he
said, ``We're the antithesis of authenticity.'' He worries that
little computers could be ambience wreckers: ``It has a kind of
tacky feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet high-tech gizmos were apparently all the rage at this year's
National Restaurant Convention in Chicago. Industry people are now
talking about the concept of a wireless restaurant. In such a
world, the bus boys wear beepers and signal the host when a table
is clear. Wait staffers take orders on handheld units and runners
deliver food from the kitchen. A request for a new fork can be
handled without the server ever leaving the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   W.J. Kitchen (not a pseudonym, he swears) is chief executive of
Ameranth Technology in San Diego, a start-up with Microsoft venture
backing that makes software for handheld devices and electronics
for the hospitality industry. A former Motorola executive with a
deep Virginia drawl that makes you long for greens and black-eyed
peas, he suggests restaurant customers could even pay for valet
parking along with their meals, and find their cars at curbside the
moment they walk outside.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen says restaurants could turn tables over up to twice as
fast with the new devices, ``and the customer's not realizing he's
being hustled.'' The system could pay for itself in nine months to
a year, he says, unwilling to specify its exact cost.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, in Paris, there is no rushing through meals. Dinner is
frequently a three-hour affair, and when you're ready to leave,
you've got to flag down your server. There, and perhaps in high-end
restaurants here, the electronics would seem to be more about good
service than fast food.
</P>
<P>
   But this is America. We like to know we can buzz through an
entree and make it to the late movie. The wireless ordering units
would seem ideally suited to large, busy restaurants and chains,
like Legal Sea Foods, Bertucci's, or Brew Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Berkowitz, chief executive of Boston's Legal Sea Foods,
said he considered the units a few years ago, but the signals
didn't always work. It was like trying to talk on a cell phone
while you drive through a tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Like many restaurants, Legal has computers stationed around the
dining room where servers place orders electronically. He's not
convinced there's a huge benefit to doing it at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can walk 10 feet to a terminal, punch it in, and it might
be less obtrusive that way,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen says servers can learn to use the devices (made by his
partner, Symbol Technology, as well as by Hewlett-Packard, Casio,
and Compaq) in 20 minutes. His company is running focus groups with
California wait staffers to see if they like it. Most do, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Halloran, a restaurant consultant in Jamestown, R.I., and
former executive chef at Cornell University, thinks restaurants are
going to have to adapt to the new technology to boost profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at your tables as a little sales area for a waiter,''
Halloran says. ``Time is money these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he notes, ``Any gimmick works in America.''

A LONE VOICE CRYING IN THE HIGH-TECH WILDERNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Mass. _ Every group needs a gadfly. For the Silicon
Valley crowd, it's Clifford Stoll, a self-proclaimed propellerhead
who thinks the Internet is a vast sinkhole for time better spent
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   To Stoll, computers are little better than television, and they
certainly don't belong in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent book, ``High Tech Heretic,'' Stoll writes
that computers ``dull questioning minds with graphical games where
quick answers take the place of understanding.'' In his book, Stoll
skewers calculators, laptops, desktops, and cell phones as gizmos
that do nothing to provoke critical thinking. Instead, they swallow
up time and waste money that should be spent on books and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   To his critics, of which there are many in the Valley, Stoll is
a Luddite, an extremist whose philosophy is as outdated as last
year's calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``His book should have been titled, `High Tech Lunatic,' '' said
John C. Dvorak, a well-known technology pundit and writer in the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other critics of technology, Stoll is no technophobe.
After getting his doctorate in planetary science, Stoll worked for
various astronomy labs, including the Lawrence Berkeley Lab at the
University of California. There Stoll became famous in 1989 for
catching a German hacker who had been selling computer secrets to
Russia in exchange for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   His career as computer contrarian didn't begin until 1995, when
he published ``Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the
Information Highway,'' an unsparing attack on the burgeoning cult
surrounding the Internet. It was selected by Business Week magazine
in 1995 as among the best business books of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Stoll, now 50, agreed to an interview last week in his Oakland
home. The first thing one notices upon entering Stoll's house,
besides a cluster of manual typewriters sitting on the floor of the
entryway, is that there are no televisions, computers, video
cassettes, or Game Boys. The most modern item in the house is a
tiny boom box in the kitchen, which belongs to Stoll's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because of a dislike for technology, but out of a
love of technology that I wrote those books,'' said Stoll, whose
unruly head of hair gives him the look of a mad yet harmless
scientist. ``As tickled as I am by gizmos, I worry that the field
is being mired by hype. It's not computers that bother me; it's the
cult of computers that gives me the heebie-jeebies.''
</P>
<P>
   The gadgets in the Stoll household are banished to a cluttered
cottage behind the house. There, Stoll keeps two Macintoshes, along
with a collection of old mechanical calculators that he is
currently fixing as a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   He also hand-blows Klein bottles, oddly shaped flasks that
theoretically exist only in the fourth dimension because their
inside is also their outside. He advertises the bottles on a Web
site and receives an order every day or two from curious
mathematicians. ``It's fun,'' Stoll said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he likes about technology, Stoll scampers off to a
closet and, after much rummaging, emerges _ beaming like a child _
with a white cardboard box. It contains a device he built several
years ago out of two coffee cans and a handful of electrical
components that he used to measure the speed of cars on his street.
He found that 85 percent of the cars were speeding. Armed with that
data, Stoll and his neighbors petitioned the city to install speed
bumps. ``I want technology to be used to make our cities and
neighborhoods better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Stoll is a full-time father, having quit academic
research years ago. He's living off the royalties of his first two
books. (``High Tech Heretic'' is his third.) His two children
attend a school where parents agree not to have televisions in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Stoll, who has been in the Bay Area for over 15 years, bemoans
the changes he has seen in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chase after dot-com riches has warped the feeling of
closeness that all of us are seeking here,'' said Stoll. His
solution? ``We are seriously considering moving to Vermont.''

DEFENSE ELECTRONICS: GETTING CIVIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phrase ``defense conversion'' refers to attempts by military
contractors to find civilian applications for their technologies.
The strategy has hardly helped the defense sector overall, as major
companies continue to struggle financially. But many defense
contractors in New England say they haven't given up hopes of
capitalizing on their know-how.
</P>
<P>
   In Manchester, N.H., for instance, the Sanders unit of Lockheed
Martin Corp. is developing a tiny drone aircraft it thinks could
have civil-sector appeal. Known as the ``micro air vehicle,'' or
MAV, the machine will be about six inches long and able to fly
about 20 minutes at speeds up to 30 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   That's comparable to some model airplanes made by hobbyists. But
Sanders engineers are also packing the tiny platform with cameras
and other optical instruments to feed data via radio to controllers
on the ground. Their goal is to keep the craft's takeoff weight
below three ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Some military applications for the MAV are obvious, such as
spotting enemy troops or directing artillery fire. On the civilian
side, Sanders envisions the product being sold to firefighters,
search-and-rescue teams, and agriculture or forestry companies,
says Sanders spokesman John Measell.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders and other Lockheed units are developing the MAV under a
$10 million contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency. (On July 13, Lockheed announced plans to sell Sanders and
other units to Britain's BAE Systems for $1.67 billion in cash.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Wilmington, Mass., meanwhile, military contractor Textron
Systems is also looking to branch out from its defense roots. A
unit of Textron Inc. of Providence, the division changed its name
from Textron Defense Systems about four years ago in an effort to
demonstrate its move into new markets.
</P>
<P>
   Textron Systems is best known in military circles for making
antitank mines and portable microwave beacons that can be used to
land large transport planes on remote airstrips.
</P>
<P>
   Sensors related to this work might also be of interest to police
agencies that need to monitor remote territories, Textron thinks.
Lately, the company has been taking orders for surveillance gear it
calls its ``Terrain Commander'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to fit in a backpack, the equipment includes a video
camera on a stalk and four acoustic sensors to detect approaching
footsteps. A cheaper version does without the camera. Textron says
it is in talks with the Australian Army, which may buy units to
help monitor remote airfields in the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Textron also has begun to market for commercial uses a
spectrometer that analyzes light in the near-infrared part of the
spectrum. First developed for applications like gunsights, the
technology has also proven useful for materials analysis. Now,
Textron is marketing it to the pharmaceutical and petrochemical
industries, and has already sold 40 of the devices for analyzing
protein and moisture levels in harvested grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have done the same thing 10 years ago, but it would
have cost you $150,000 to $200,000 a unit,'' said Robert Buckley, a
Textron senior vice president. The new spectrometers sell for
around $15,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Burlington, Mass., a unit of France's Thomson-CSF is also
expanding beyond its military roots. The division, Cetia, has about
60 people locally and develops robust computer chips, circuit
boards, and software for defense contractors such as Lockheed
Martin, Raytheon, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Cetia has found some success selling its chips to cell
phone companies like Ericsson and Nokia. The company expects the
business will help it increase revenue to around $25 million in the
United States and Europe this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Thomson said it would combine Cetia with Matrix
Corp,. a Raleigh, N.C., company it recently acquired. Cetia
specializes in making parts that can tolerate shock and vibration,
while Matrix produces parts meant to function in extreme heat and
cold. Cetia's employment level won't change because of the merger,
Thomson said. But the new unit, while keeping the Cetia name, will
move its headquarters to Raleigh.

MALLS STAKING THEIR CLAIM ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Checker Flag Lightning is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet opened up a new and vibrant channel for purchasing
toys, books, and other merchandise. But for the most part,
customers still waited a few days for packages to hit their
doorsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Now, imagine ordering online from stores in your local mall, and
instantly gratifying your desire for the latest Lauryn Hill CD or
Harry Potter book. You could request same-day delivery or grab
packages at the mall drive-through. Or, you could pick up your
filled bags from a mall booth while taking the kids to see Santa.
</P>
<P>
   Those days may not be far away. After years of dismissing or
downplaying the electronic marketplace, the nation's malls are
trying to stake their claims on the Web by leveraging long-standing
relationships with thousands of retailers. Their push online will
put them in direct competition with Internet portals like Yahoo and
Lycos _ which have invested heavily in their shopping meccas.
</P>
<P>
   General Growth Properties Inc., the nation's second-largest mall
owner, is now building online versions of its shopping centers,
selling software tools and Internet space to both mom-and-pop
stores and retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is core business for us,'' said Charlie Graves, senior
vice president of e-business for the Chicago-based real estate
investment trust. ``We already have business relationships with
15,000 retailers, so we're already committed to helping them
improve their sales. . . . Now, we're giving our retailers a new
tool set to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first shopping centers to leap online will be Natick
(Mass.) Mall, which will start opening Net stores this fall.
General Growth has set up Web addresses, such as Natickmall.com,
for all its 136 shopping centers. Customers can access General
Growth Properties at a central site called Mallibu.com.
</P>
<P>
   General Growth wants to give its merchants templated software
tools and broadband Internet connections to help them set up their
virtual stores. At each online mall, customers will be able to pay
for all purchases in a single credit-card transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The program is clearly in its infancy. Right now, customers can
use the Natick Mall's Web site to get information on mall stores,
operating hours, directions, and the spring arrival of the Easter
Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   Even these rudimentary e-offerings need more attention. For
example, the directions link at Natickmall.com did not work last
week. And the stuffed hare has long since scurried back to his
hutch, though the site is still promoting his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Only one General Growth property is up and run-
</P>
<P>
   ning. RiverTown Crossings near Grand Rapids, Mich., introduced
the service in June along with a drive-through window. Next month,
General Growth will debut an e-commerce site for Stonebriar Center
in Dallas. Northridge Fashion Center in California and North Point
Mall in Alpharetta, Ga., follow later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Checker &UR;  &LR; Flag Lightning, which carries NASCAR clothing
and collectibles, is the only merchant inside RiverTown Crossings
that's actually selling through the Web site. It offers just three
products, including a Dale Earnhardt Monopoly game and a Jeff
Gordon inflatable car.
</P>
<P>
   General Growth also must figure out a way to integrate its
online malls with existing e-commerce sites operated by Macy's,
Gap, and other national retail chains. Until then, big retailers
like J.C. Penney will only provide links to their online stores.
</P>
<P>
   Still, General Growth's new focus on Net sales represents a
marked departure from its position just two years ago. Back then,
mall owners and retail brokers regarded the growth in e-commerce
with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took this job a little over a year ago, and I think I got
the job more out of a defensive position,'' Graves said. ``Before,
I think the attitude was `Oh my God, what are we going to do about
the Internet?' Now it's, `What are we going to do with the
Internet?' ''
</P>
<P>
   During last year's holiday season, Saint Louis Galleria, a
suburban mall in Richmond Heights, Mo., took the extra step of
barring tenants from promoting their Web sites on shopping bags,
storefronts, or anything on the mall property.
</P>
<P>
   The unpopular ban was dropped after it proved largely
ineffective. Many of the mall's 170 stores griped about the rules,
one merchant threatened to sue, and others blatantly ignored the
Galleria's management.
</P>
<P>
   After Christmas, mall owners also realized that the e-commerce
threat had not materialized. Sales at mall stores rose a robust 7.7
percent during the holiday selling season, according to the
International Council of Shopping Centers.
</P>
<P>
   General Growth's change in attitude has occurred against a
backdrop of consolidation in the retail industry. Under pressure to
deliver fresh and entertaining concepts, mall owners are
introducing stores such as teen e-tailer Delias.com and J. Jill _ a
catalog and online merchant _ into traditional centers like Natick
Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business has changed tremendously in the last four
years,'' Graves said. ``Of our top-performing retail concepts,
probably eight out of 10 are new.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts note that even giants like General Growth and Simon
Property Group Inc., the nation's largest mall owner, have been
slow to migrate to the Web. And today, they say, the mall owners
continue to lag online counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think General Growth has a bigger learning curve,'' said
Malachy Kavanagh, a spokesman for the International Council of
Shopping Centers. ``There's not a lot on (Mallibu.com), but they're
working on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Mallibu.com, Simon Property's Web site, Shopsimon.com,
provides a large number of links to well-known retailers such as
Best Buy, Nordstrom, Gap, and Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, however, this is ancient stuff. Online portals
like AOL, Yahoo, and Lycos introduced their shopping areas years
ago. And they now offer sophisticated search tools that allow
customers to simultaneously sift through thousands of stores for a
single item.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a search for cufflinks at Yahoo yields more than
940 items, including silver terrier cufflinks for $11.10 and
sapphire cufflinks for $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Today, almost anyone can be a shopping mall. In a sense,
Amazon.com Inc. is the Web's biggest mall, offering books, toys,
CDs, antiques, refrigerators, and much, much more. EBay is the
Net's biggest flea market. Then there are a host of sites like
fashionmall.com, campmall.com, and jewelrymall.com trying to carve
out niches.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, everyone is a mall on the Web _ except the
bricks-and-mortar malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best General Growth and other mall developers can
hope for is that they're able to deepen the relationships that they
already have with consumers,'' said Ken Cassar, an analyst with
Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm. ``I don't
believe that sites like Mallibu will ever become significant
destination points.''
</P>
<P>
   Where General Growth seems to be having some success is with
smaller retailers that want to promote their businesses without
spending millions of dollars on e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows about the London Harness name in this area,''
said Sandra Macaluso, manager of the London Harness Company leather
store in Natick Mall. ``This would give us exposure across the
country, if not internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsoon Accessories, a British retail chain that opened its
first and only US store in Natick Mall, also is interested in
Mallibu.com. The company operates a Web site in the United Kingdom.
Due to customs complications, however, US Web shoppers can look but
can't buy, said manager Heather Ahlburn.
</P>
<P>
   Mallibu.com, she said, would give her a place to steer US
customers and a way to grow her revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, (Mallibu.com) is the perfect solution,'' Ahlburn said.
``For me, it would mean a massive increase in business.''

NEW PICTURE FRAME CREATES POLAROID MOMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Polaroid may have solved the problem of delivering pictures in
real time to your technology-wary parents who don't yet _ and may
never _ own a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Soon you'll be able to buy them a $249 picture frame developed
by Polaroid subcontractor Ceiva Inc. of West Hollywood, Calif.,
before you leave on vacation. Then you can fly to Florida, snap
digital photos of the grandkids at Disney World and send them
directly into the picture frame on your parents' mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it'll work: Polaroid will sell a low-end digital
camera with a built-in modem and a small liquid crystal display to
see just-snapped images with VGA resolution (640 x 480 pixels)
suitable for computer screens. The camera, also $249, will include
four megabytes of internal memory capable of storing 30 pictures.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of sightseeing, a family can go back to their hotel,
connect the camera's modem to the telephone jack and push a button
that automatically dials into a new company Web site _
Polaroiddigital.com _ to upload and store all of the images. The
Web site's computers then download the collected images to either
the family computer or to the new digital picture frame.
</P>
<P>
   The picture frame also has a built-in modem that is plugged into
a telephone jack and can store 10 images, even in the home of
grandparents thousands of miles away who don't have a PC. (The
frame can also display news, weather, and sports headlines.)
</P>
<P>
   This entire transaction _ from shipping the images over the
Internet to receiving them _ will take a matter of minutes,
according to officials at Cambridge-based Polaroid. Both the camera
and the picture frame will have numeric codes matched to ensure a
secure transaction and avoid the images getting lost. And just as
Federal Express does not open sealed boxes, Polaroid says it will
not view the images before they are sent.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid, the 63-year-old pioneer of instant photography, has
been expanding into the digital camera business. Low-end digital
cameras and software now account for 10 percent of its $1.98
billion in annual revenues. Polaroid faces stiff competition in
that market, however, from Eastman Kodak and a host of smaller
companies catering to a fast-growing group of digital camera owners
using the Web for sending and receiving snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers familiar with Polaroid know that most of its instant
film costs about $10 for 10 single pictures. That's expensive
compared with 35mm color film, which sells for about $5 a roll, a
market dominated by Kodak and Fuji; a one-hour photo finishing
laboratory will develop and print 24 prints for under $10. Combined
with the film cost, the $15 total for more than twice as many
pictures, has limited Polaroid's growth.
</P>
<P>
   Digital photography and the Internet complicates this equation.
Fewer digital images are printed out compared with a single roll of
24- or 36-exposure film as users only want keepsake paper copies of
the best pictures. Sending images over the Internet or around the
country is quick and inexpensive. And Polaroid is expected to face
new competition next year from Kodak, Fuji, and others that are
developing low-cost printing devices to instantly capture digital
images on paper.
</P>
<P>
   This new photographic equation poses challenges for Polaroid,
which earns most of its profits from its instant film packs. One
answer is the digital frames _ sleek devices that use the same
screen technology found in laptop computers to display images from
a digital camera transmitted over the Internet through telephone
wires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe connected digital frames will be a killer
application in driving mass consumer adoption of digital cameras,''
said Gibboney Huske, imaging analyst for Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid plans to begin marketing the digital frame early next
year after it rolls out its new digital camera in January. Due out
this fall is a new portable Polaroid printer (selling for, you
guessed it, $249) that uses Polaroid's $10 film packs to provide
paper prints of digital images on the frame.
</P>
<P>
   A similar concept is underway at Eastman Kodak Co., based in
Rochester, N.Y. Working with Weave Innovations Inc. of Santa Clara,
Calif., Kodak has developed Storybox, a $299 frame that can store
up to 36 images for a monthly fee of $4 to $9.
</P>
<P>
   Storybox, due out later this summer, also goes beyond
photographs by providing users with content from the Weather
Channel, MSNBC headlines and sports news, and, eventually, stock
quotes. Both Kodak and Polaroid's digital frames require using a
personal computer _ your own, if not your parents' _ for setup, to
register the transmission of images between the camera and the
digital frame.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Polaroid, which can print small images from its
digital frame immediately, Kodak requires going through its
Print(at)Kodak Web site and having prints returned overnight _ at
49 cents per digital picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our real big initiative is to have a stronger presence on the
Internet with the ability to print images anywhere at any time
using wireless mobile technology,'' said Stephen Golden, Polaroid's
director of marketing for its Worldwide Consumer Electronics group.
Golden said the final pricing of Polaroiddigital.com services _ the
uploading, storing, and downloading of images _ has not been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Polaroid faces a tough sell with its instant film packs
at $1 a print for pictures that are 2-by-3 inches, compared with
Kodak's 4-by-6-inch prints from digital images at 49 cents, albeit
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Polaroid chief executive Gary DiCamillo acknowledged
that a new instant imaging technology is on the way, possibly by
late next year, that will cut the cost down to around 25 cents an
image. No doubt Kodak and Fuji are not far behind.

about child care and schooling. I can stay up as late as I want,
and wake up at a civilized hour, and never have to sock piles of
money away for tuition or buying my 16-year-old a car. By ROB
MORSE.

   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The angry quotes are predictable
from business and vacation travelers stranded or delayed. Someone
with a notebook or microphone asks what the travelers think of the
particular labor action _ by pilots, flight attendants or
maintenance workers _ that CAUSED their delayed or canceled
flights. ``You can't print (or put on TV) what I think,'' is the
general hostile theme. By STEPHANIE SALTER.

 &HT;    Psychotherapy has gone online _ and critics say that's
depressing
 &HT;    By Kirk Kicklighter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the ether of the Internet, you can find friends, have sex or
day-trade, all from the comfort of your home via computer. Now you
can talk to somebody online about your problems, too.
</P>
<P>
   Online counselors and therapists increasingly are providing help
to clients over the Internet, trading face-to-face voices and
gestures for words on the World Wide Web. Known as Internet
therapy, ``e-therapy'' or ``e-counseling,'' the practice seems to
capture the essence of online communication _ anonymity,
convenience and uninhibitedness _ in a therapeutic bottle.
</P>
<P>
   David Stone, a clinical psychologist in San Antonio, swears by
it. He cites the case of a religious man from Indiana who wanted to
save himself for marriage but instead contracted genital warts
while having sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was embarrassed and ashamed, and convinced God was
punishing him for his sin,'' says Stone. ``He didn't know anyone he
could turn to for help.'' Severely depressed, the man logged onto a
Web site, www.concernedcounseling.com, typed in his credit card
number and, within no time, was chatting privately with Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met four times online,'' says Stone, a licensed therapist
for 10 years, who eventually helped the man find traditional
therapy. ``It didn't matter where he was from or where I was from.
What mattered was that he needed support and privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say ``Internet therapy'' is an oxymoron. They define
therapy as the physical act of two or more people gathering in its
name and argue that e-therapy poses too many ethical and legal
problems to be legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really torn about it,'' says Linda Buchanan, clinical
director of the Atlanta Center for Eating Disorders. ``We
definitely wouldn't do it now, because it's so unproven. I'm uneasy
about the lack of physical contact, but I can envision scenarios
where it might work. We'll have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Such questions are why David Nickelson, director of technology
policy and projects for the American Psychological Association,
advises people to first seek face-to-face therapy. ``We still need
research,'' Nickelson says. ``And it may find that there are just
some things therapists and their patients can't do over the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say that 500 to 1,000 Internet ``therapists'' are
chatting with up to 10,000 clients a week worldwide. About.com
estimates that 160 Web sites, from Chicago to Hong Kong, offer
e-counseling. These would-be e-shrinks range from psychiatrists and
social workers to licensed professional counselors and quacks,
which is why would-be clients are advised to first check
therapists' credentials with state licensing offices.
</P>
<P>
   Says Linda Campbell, a psychologist and University of Georgia
associate professor who teaches mental health ethics: ``It's so new
that we haven't come up with any way to regulate it or judge its
efficacy yet. And there are definitely so-called professionals on
the Web who are walking a fine line. They say they aren't
technically doing therapy, but I'll bet it seems that way to the
client.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say e-therapy erases barriers that keep people from
physically visiting a therapist. About 30 percent of people who
make a first appointment for traditional counseling never show up
or never return after one visit, says the APA. Others may live in
isolated areas, be disabled, travel often or fear the stigma of
seeking therapy. The distance of cyberspace also creates a sense of
safety that can lead to a kind of intimacy, advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Williamson, a New York-based Internet communications
specialist, says she contacted an online therapist for depression
in 1995. They exchanged e-mails for two years, an experience she
calls ``profound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit like writing in a journal, except that I
got feedback every day,'' she says. ``Because we were working
online, I felt like he was nearer to me than if we had met in an
office. (It) really helped me to focus on what I was working
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson later started an Internet therapy advocacy site,
www.metanoia.org, which reviews issues surrounding the practice and
lists therapists who have passed a background check of licensing
and training conducted by Williamson and other volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics denounce the idea of sending private thoughts into
cyberspace to someone who may not be qualified and who can't see
the doubt or tears in a patient's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked to do Internet therapy by companies, and I've
refused,'' says Patti Beaudoin, a psychologist who practices in
Roswell. ``It would be ineffective ... especially when you consider
that 80 percent of all communication is nonverbal.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaudoin says that little signals such as a patient's voice
tone, foot jiggling and posture can provide vital information to
therapists. She uses her own voice and body as well, softening her
tone or emphasizing a point while leaning forward. ``How would I do
all that on the Internet?''
</P>
<P>
   Also, e-therapists usually don't have access to patient
histories or medical files.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's payment for such services. Online services vary
in format and price, from $25 for a question to $50-$90 for an hour
of chat to $150-$300 for a month of unlimited e-mails. Most clients
pay by credit card. Stone says he makes $45 every half-hour from an
upfront credit card payment, without worrying about insurance
company approval. He chats online with 10 clients a week, in
addition to his office practice. By comparison, an hour of
face-to-face psychotherapy in Atlanta can cost $150 or more.
</P>
<P>
   But health insurers don't cover online counseling. ``We're
hearing about it and getting a few queries,'' says Daniel Jolivet,
a vice president of clinical services for Magellan Behavioral
Health of Georgia. ``If the interest is there, we'd begin a process
called `new technology assessment.' You're probably looking at a
few years at least.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal jurisdiction also could be an issue, because those who are
licensed typically have credentials in only one state. Where is
licensed therapy taking place, for example, if a social worker in
Georgia is working with a client in Michigan via a chat room
originating on a server in California?
</P>
<P>
   ``The professional at a desktop computer in Atlanta might say
they are practicing in Georgia,'' says Linda Campbell, who recently
chaired the Georgia Psychological Association's Ethics Committee,
``but what recourse does the out-of-state client have under Georgia
laws if something goes wrong? And what does the professional do
about having backup emergency services in the client's location in
case of crisis?''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia licensing board neither sanctions nor forbids
Internet therapy. The Georgia Psychological Association says the
state should establish a policy once national task forces on the
Internet draft their own standards.
</P>
<P>
   Even its staunchest advocates don't claim that the Internet is
always the most appropriate place for therapy. Stone and Williamson
agree that online counseling may work best as a short-term
introduction to conventional therapy or as a continuing
relationship between parties who have met face to face for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, technology may settle many questions about
e-therapy's viability. Sophisticated Internet video conferencing,
which would allow therapist and client to hear and see each other,
is an estimated three years away.

SALAD DAYS OF SUMMER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, those salad days of summer. Readers sent along plenty of
salad recipe options to fill the Sherman Oaks request for delicious
and easy possibilities to serve at a summer shower. A sampling of
those received follows.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Becerra notes that the Broccoli Salad is great. Not only
is it easy to make, but even broccoli-haters have been converted
after tasting it. Although it's fattening, feel free to substitute
low-fat mayonnaise for half (no more!) of the regular mayonnaise
called for in the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Munroe's Chicken Salad recipe was shared by a friend who is
a foods teacher at a local junior high. She's used the recipe for
years, and it has always been a hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Cucumber Salad can be made in advance and is delicious,
notes Frances Gleim. Sunshine Salad, with a rice base and lots of
veggies, is easy and attractive, writes Sue Pearcy. Use ham, turkey
or other cooked, cubed meat as desired.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Walsh has made Chicken-Cranberry Molded Salad for
birthdays and wedding receptions. It is impressive, delicious and
convenient, as it can be made the day before serving.

   Elinor Koby has served Curry Chicken Salad at two showers and

DOUBTING `THOMAS': PRESCHOOLERS WON'T SIT STILL FOR THE PLOT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas the Tank Engine is the main character in a quaint series
of children's books that have been made into pleasing little
animated TV shows and videos, but on the way to the big screen the
idea got derailed.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot be argued that the new feature ``Thomas and the Magic
Railroad'' was in the wrong hands. Britt Allcroft, its producer,
writer and director, found the Rev. Wilber Awdry's books and
brought them to life in the early `80s with the series ``Thomas the
Tank Engine and Friends'' and ``Shining Time Station,'' seen here
first on PBS and now on Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' has two big problems. First,
in an effort to fill about 90 minutes, Allcroft has made the story
too complex for its target audience of preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a precocious steam engine on the Island of Sodor, learns
that nasty Diesel 10 intends to find a certain lost engine then do
away with all the island's steam engines to take control of the
Sodor railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is a man who lives on Muffle Mountain, Burnett
Stone (Peter Fonda), who never smiles, keeps to himself and
secretly tends a steam engine whose fire went out long ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Mr. Conductor (Alec Baldwin) must keep the
peace on Sodor in the absence of the vacationing railroad owner,
Sir Topham Hatt. But Mr. Conductor finds out he is running out of
his vital gold dust which helps him travel between Shining Time
Station, where he is about a foot tall, to Sodor, where he is
scaled proportionate to the trains.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett's granddaughter, Lily (Mara Wilson), comes to visit him
from The Big City and winds up in Shining Time by mistake, thereby
getting enlisted by Mr. Conductor's surfer dude cousin, Junior, to
help with finding more gold dust.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the mystery of a magic railway that shows in
shadowy lines on a Shining Time map but whose exact position and
purpose are unclear. Thomas figures it can be reached by going
through a magic buffer, one of those wooden structures at the end
of a track that stops trains.
</P>
<P>
   Still with me? Well, the 3- and 4-year-olds watching the movie
aren't. They perk up when the trains are rumbling across the screen
but get fidgety when there's too much exposition.
</P>
<P>
   The animation is true to the style of the TV series:
three-dimensional engines that wobble down the tracks, their eyes
moving back and forth and their facial expressions changing only
when they're off camera. The trains talk, but their mouths don't
move to match the words.
</P>
<P>
   For sentimental Thomas fans that's a plus; they want to see the
same Thomas and friends that they've enjoyed for years. But for
newcomers to the franchise, the animation is a letdown, looking
like Destination Films could not or would not put more energy into
it.
</P>
<P>
   The live characters are the best part of this package. Baldwin,
in a role he surely never would have taken before he became a
father, is charming as the conductor. In the moments he looks
directly into the camera, he really connects with his young
moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda's talents are underused here, but he does a good job of
making Burnett sad but not scary. Wilson, best known for her roles
in ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' and ``Miracle on 34th Street,'' is appealing
as Lily.
</P>
<P>
   The complex story is too much to chew for the average
preschooler, but the kids who are old enough to stick with the plot
probably already saw the visually stunning ``Dinosaur'' and the
clay-animation tour de force ``Chicken Run'' and will be left
yawning by the simplistic ``Thomas and the Magic Railroad''
animation. Thomas and his friends are better off living in books,
videos and TV programs and should leave the big screen to other
kiddie characters. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
The film: ``Thomas and the Magic Railroad'': G. &QL; 
The stars: Alec Baldwin, Mara Wilson, Peter Fonda, Michael E.
Rodgers. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed, written and produced by Britt
Allcroft; co- producer Phil Fehrle. &QL; 
Running time: 86 minutes. &QL; 
Playing: Citywide. &QL; 
Our rating: 2 stars. &QL;

RASPBERRY BROWNIE COBBLER
</HEADLINE>
 Here is a dessert for people who have trouble deciding between
fruit and chocolate  _  raspberries topped with chocolate-nut
batter rather than the usual oats or crumbs. It's best served warm,
so pop it in the oven a little before you sit down to dinner and
serve about an hour later, with vanilla ice cream, if desired. 
2 1/2 ounces bittersweet (not unsweetened chocolate) 
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into several pieces 
1/2 cup walnuts 
1 pint fresh raspberries 
1 cup sugar 
2 large eggs 
1/2 teaspoon vanilla 
7 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
1 pint vanilla ice cream, softened a bit (optional)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Put 2 inches of water in saucepan or bottom of double boiler and
bring to a bare simmer. Combine chocolate and butter in stainless
steel bowl and place on top of simmering water, making sure water
doesn't touch bowl. Heat, whisking occasionally, until chocolate
and butter are completely melted.
</P>
<P>
   While chocolate is melting, coarsely chop nuts. Spray 8-inch
square baking dish with cooking spray. Scatter berries across
bottom of dish.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk together sugar, eggs and vanilla in bowl. Whisk in melted
chocolate. Stir in flour, nuts and salt. Pour batter over berries
and smooth with spatula.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven until a toothpick inserted
into center of cobbler comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let stand
15 minutes and serve with ice cream if desired. Makes 6 to 8
servings.

1 cup all-purpose flour &QL; 
3/4 cup sliced almonds &QL; 
1/4 cup sugar &QL; 
1/8 teaspoon salt &QL;

BOULDER CITY COUNCIL ASIDE, PETS ARE STILL PROPERTY

 c.2000 The Chicago Sun-Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the JonBenet frenzy blemished its persona, the city of
Boulder, Colo., was known to outsiders as a breathtakingly
beautiful community nestled in the valley below the Rocky Mountains
and populated by many laid-back and eccentric characters of
considerable charm and whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   Let me put it another way. They've got a lot of freaks in
Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean that as a negative. As I always say, let your freak
flag fly! (All right, I never say that, but I heard Abbie Hoffman
say it on TV a long time ago. Or maybe it was Wavy Gravy.) But if
you walk down the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, you'll see quite a
colorful array of aging hippies, long-haired bikers, skateboarding
runaways and tie-dyed Deadheads.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, from what I experienced on a couple of visits to
Boulder, a certain incense-burning, tie-dyed-fashion,
save-the-whooping-crane attitude permeates much of the town. So
when I received an e-mail last week from an animal rights group
about a ``bold and progressive move on behalf of animals,'' I
wasn't surprised to see a Boulder dateline on the news release.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I had my doubts about the validity of this
announcement, which arrived courtesy of a group known as In Defense
of Animals, or IDA.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from the release:
</P>
<P>
   ``BOULDER, Colo. _ In a bold and progressive move on behalf of
animals, the Boulder City Council voted 8-1 to accept a proposal to
change the city's municipal code to refer to people as the guardian
of their animal companions instead of as their `owners.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Erasing the category of `owner' does not change a person's
legal rights, responsibilities and liabilities to their companion
animals, and animals will still be deemed property. However, by
codifying the concept of animal guardianship, the City Council is
recognizing animals should be included in our social ethic for
reasons beyond their monetary worth as commodities.
</P>
<P>
   '''The Boulder City Council should be commended for their
foresight and conviction of recognizing companion animals, not as
mere objects to be bought, sold and discarded at their owner's
whim, but as individuals with needs and interests of their own,'
said Elliot Katz, president of In Defense of Animals. 'Boulder is
truly on the cutting edge in terms of evolving our social ethic to
include all beings, both human and non-human alike.'''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently no dogs, cats, chickens, snakes or tropical fish
could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   My first reaction upon receiving this e-mail was one of delight.
After all, I'm compiling a new collection of Internet urban
legends, and this one was a beauty. A city council of grown adults
debating such an issue, and then voting by a near-unanimous margin
to change its municipal code to eliminate the term ``animal
owner,'' are you kidding me? What a clever hoax!
</P>
<P>
   Only one problem: It's for real. Last week, the Boulder City
Council actually did vote 8-1 to adopt changes in its animal
ordinances that will replace the phrase ``pet owner'' with ``pet
guardian.''
</P>
<P>
   As former Councilman Ben Greenlee, who said he would have voted
against the ordinance, told the Denver Post, ``It's the kind of
silly nonsense that we, somehow or another, adore here in
Boulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Well yes. Not that we have much room to talk in Chicago, what
with members of our City Council holding an inquisition of Jerry
Springer and debating everything from cheese sandwiches to whether
Hugh Hefner should have an honorary street name. But still, this
``pet guardian'' resolution is a priceless piece of precious
poppycock _ and it is of course pure bull droppings.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care if you project human emotions onto your pet and I
don't care if you prefer the cartoonishly simple love you have for
your pet over the much more complicated and textured relationships
a person has with another person _ if you have a pet, you own that
pet. That pet is your slave, kept in a cage or tethered to a leash
and completely at your mercy.
</P>
<P>
   How'd you get your pet in the first place? Either somebody gave
it to you or you bought it. From that point on you name your pet,
feed your pet, bathe your pet, give medicine to your pet,
discipline your pet.
</P>
<P>
   Pet your pet.
</P>
<P>
   Even the smartest animal is far too pea-brained to execute this
sort of reasoning or speak for itself, but let's take a kangaroo
leap in logic and imagine asking a domesticated creature _ say, a
French poodle _ if it would prefer to have complete and stupid
freedom, or if it would choose to continue with a life of having
its toenails painted, listening to its owner babble in babytalk and
wearing a collar and tags displaying its ridiculous name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Au revoir,'' the poodle would say. The poodle would bolt! But
it can't, because it is not sharing a life with a guardian or a
companion, it is a cuddly piece of property.

COUNTRY PEACH PIE &QL; 
Nothing says summer and home better than a freshly baked pie, a pie
that, to quote a friend, ``screams peaches.'' &QL; 
Basic Pie Dough for a 2-crust pie (Recipe follows) &QL; 
8 large (3 1/2 to 4 pounds) ripe peaches &QL; 
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice &QL; 
1/3 cup packed light brown sugar &QL; 
1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar &QL; 
3 tablespoons cornstarch &QL; 
Pinch EACH ground cinnamon, ground mace OR fresh-grated nutmeg and
salt &QL; 
2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces &QL; 
1 tablespoon milk, for glaze &QL; 
Vanilla ice cream (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Divide Basic Pie Dough into 2 slightly unequal pieces. Roll out
larger piece on a lightly floured surface to a large circle no more
that 1/8-inch thick; fit it, without stretching, into a buttered,
deep 9 1/2- or 10-inch pie pan. Trim edge, leaving a 3/4-inch
overhang. Roll out remaining dough into a large circle and transfer
to a foil-lined baking sheet. Chill doughs.
</P>
<P>
   Dip peaches in boiling water 15 seconds; peel off skins. Squeeze
lemon juice into a large bowl. Working quickly, stone and thickly
slice peaches, letting slices fall into bowl. You should have about
8 cups. Toss gently and discard any excess juices.
</P>
<P>
   Sift together brown sugar, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, cornstarch,
cinnamon, mace and salt. Toss gently with peaches and pour mixture
into crust in pie pan, mounding peaches in center.
</P>
<P>
   Dot with butter. Moisten edge of crust with cold water. Loosely
drape remaining dough over filling. Trim off excess dough, leaving
a 3/4-inch overhang. Turn edges of top crust under edges of bottom
crust, forming a smooth border on rim of pie pan. Crimp or flute
border.
</P>
<P>
   Brush pastry lightly with milk, sprinkle with remaining 1
tablespoon granulated sugar. Cut several slashes in top crust to
release steam.
</P>
<P>
   Cover edges of dough with strips of foil if desired, to prevent
overbrowning. Place pie on rack in lower third of oven, with a
sheet of foil underneath to catch any drips.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 425-degree oven until golden brown, about 40
to 45 minutes, removing strips of foil, if using, after 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cool pie on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature, with
vanilla ice cream, if desired. Makes 1 deep 9 1/2- or 10-inch pie;
about 8 servings.

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BASIC PIE DOUGH &QL; 
The crusts for traditional fruit pies and other old-fashioned pies
are usually made with lard or vegetable shortening, or a
combination of butter (for flavor) and one of the other fats (for
flakiness). This recipe is a modern version. &QL; 
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour &QL; 
2 teaspoons sugar &QL; 
3/4 teaspoon salt &QL; 
11 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces &QL; 
2 1/2 tablespoons cold solid vegetable shortening &QL; 
5 tablespoons cold water, plus more as needed
</P>
<P>
   Combine flour, sugar, salt, butter and shortening in a food
processor or in a mixing bowl. Pulse machine on and off (OR cut
ingredients together with 2 knives) until mixture is crumbly.
</P>
<P>
   Add water and pulse (or toss with a fork) until mixture begins
to clump together. Gather into a ball, sprinkling with a few more
drops of water, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Flatten slightly into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and chill at
least 30 minutes before rolling out.
</P>
<P>
   Makes enough dough for a double crust 9- or 10-inch pie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FREE-FORM FRUIT PASTRY &QL; 
Packaged puff pastry streamlines the preparation of this
professional- looking pastry. Bake a crisp, flaky raft topped with
cheese or almond filling, then add your choice of fruit. &QL; 
1 sheet (half of a 17 1/4-ounce package) frozen puff pastry &QL; 
Cheese OR Almond Filling &QL; 
1/3 cup red currant jelly OR orange marmalade &QL; 
About 2 cups halved strawberries, sliced apricots OR sliced peaches
(OR 1 cup EACH of 2 different fruits)
</P>
<P>
   Thaw puff pastry at room temperature 20 minutes. Meanwhile,
prepare your choice of Filling.
</P>
<P>
   Place pastry on an ungreased 12x15-inch baking sheet and unfold.
Spread filling down length of pastry, to about 1 1/2 inches from
both long sides; then fold sides of pastry over to cover edges of
filling.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 425-degree oven about 12 to 15 minutes or
until browned. Place baking sheet on a rack; let pastry cool
completely. (At this point, you may cover loosely with foil and let
cooled pastry stand at room temperature up to 2 hours.)
</P>
<P>
   Up to 1 hour before serving, melt jelly or marmalade in a small
pan over low heat (use jelly with berries, marmalade with apricots
or peaches). Lightly brush filling with some of jelly. Arrange
fruit over filling, overlapping pieces slightly. Brush with
remaining jelly.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, cut pastry into slices with a sharp knife. Makes 8 to
10 servings.
</P>
<P>
   CHEESE FILLING: In small bowl of an electric mixer, beat
together 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese (softened), 1/3 cup
sugar, 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2
teaspoon grated lemon peel until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ALMOND FILLING: In small bowl of an electric mixer, beat 1/4 cup
butter OR margarine until creamy. Gradually add 1 (7-ounce) package
almond paste, 1 egg white and 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel; beat
until smooth and well blended.

 &QL; 
NO-BAKE BLUEBERRY PIE &QL; 
Pure blueberry flavor with no distractions. That's the best way to
describe this quick-to-fix pie filling. &QL; 
1 (9-inch) baked pie crust &QL; 
4 cups blueberries &QL; 
3/4 cup sugar &QL; 
2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch &QL; 
2 tablespoons EACH cold water and lemon juice &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon &QL; 
Sweetened whipped cream
</P>
<P>
   Fill baked pie crust with 3 cups blueberries.
</P>
<P>
   In a pan, crush remaining 1 cup berries and stir in sugar; cook
over medium heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   Stir together cornstarch, water and lemon juice; add to berry
mixture along with cinnamon. Cook, stirring, until mixture boils
and thickens; spoon over berries in pastry shell. Refrigerate at
least 1 hour or up to 8 hours. Serve with whipped cream. Makes 6
servings.

fruit pie. With produce bins overflowing with a rainbow of the
season's fresh fruits  &UR; _ &LR;  from peaches and nectarines to plums and
pears and an array of berries  &UR; _ &LR;  the time is ripe for turning out
some luscious and glorious beauties at home. The possibilities and
combinations are numerous and rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   If making a pie crust eludes you (or you don't have time), don't
give up. Simply skip creating the crust altogether and pick up a
box of refrigerated, rolled-out and folded prepared crusts in the
supermarket deli section  &UR; _ &LR;  they're ready to use on a moment's
notice. It's even feasible to use store-bought phyllo and puff
pastry dough for lining pie pans. And if you want something even
simpler to use the bounty of summer fruits, you might find
cobblers, crisps and crumbles even less intimidating. A range of
recipe choices is included here.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Classic Home Desserts,'' the late Richard Sax writes,
``Many find baking a pie more threatening than preparing any other
dessert. And it's making and rolling out the crust that gets the
Anxiety Devil going.''
</P>
<P>
   It's really not that difficult if you follow a few simple
procedures. The general rule for making good pie crust doughs:
``Handle them as little as possible and keep them cool as you
work,'' writes Sax, to avoid having the fat break down and become
greasy, which results in a leaden crust.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C.-based baking expert Lisa Yockelson, author of
``Country Pies'' (and numerous other baking books), writes, ``When
making pie dough, remember all liquids and fats (even shortening)
should be used cold so your pie crust will bake up tender and
flaky. When working with pie dough, your hands should be cool; if
they are warm, rinse them in cold water before handling the dough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone should learn to make a pie crust by hand to
get the feel of how a dough is actually formed,'' encourages
Yockelson. A food processor allows you to make the dough without
actually touching it except at the end. Be careful to avoid
overmixing or overworking the dough. ``If you're concerned about
overmixing, make the dough by hand.''
</P>
<P>
   While some experts suggest combining butter and solid vegetable
shortening for the most tender, flaky doughs, others prefer using
only butter for best flavor results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I favor butter for flavor,'' says Yockelson, who never uses a
packaged pie crust. ``To me, making a pie crust is like an act of
breathing. I make a pie crust as someone would pour milk into a
glass. It is that natural to me.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's feasible to roll out the dough as soon as the pastry
ingredients are combined, chilling the dough
 &UR; _ &LR;  which gives the gluten a chance to rest and relax a bit
 &UR; _ &LR;  makes it more tender and prevents it from contracting during
baking.
</P>
<P>
   The trick to rolling out the dough is to push outward from the
center  &UR; _ &LR;  not back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   You can refrigerate the prepared pie dough three days or freeze
it up to three months.
</P>
<P>
   To save time, Yockelson keeps 10-inch rounds of rolled-out
pastry dough (which she freezes on a baking sheet between two
sheets of waxed paper until firm and then wraps well and stores in
a plastic pie carrier) stashed in the freezer. Transfer from the
freezer to the fridge to slowly thaw overnight.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to thickeners  &UR; _ &LR;  which give the juice of the
fruits body and sheen  &UR; _ &LR;  some baking experts avoid flour because
it turns the fruit juices gummy and cloudy. Food writer John Thorne
of the Simple Cooking newsletter is adamant that fruit fillings
should never be thickened with flour.
</P>
<P>
   Yockelson says she selects the thickener for her fruit pies
based on the type of fruit being used. She sometimes uses flour
with good results. ''I've never seen it as a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   However, many bakers recommend using cornstarch, quick-cooking
tapioca, arrowroot or potato starch.
</P>
<P>
   Sax thickens his fruit creations with cornstarch, using about
three tablespoons per five to six cups of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   But the amount of thickener necessary depends on the fruit and
how juicy it is. It's best to use a tested recipe as a guideline so
you don't end up with juices flowing out of control. Also keep in
mind that the riper the fruit, the lower its pectin level, so you
may want to add more thickener if your fruit is very ripe.
</P>
<P>
   You can judge the juiciness of the fruit by how much juice is at
the bottom of the bowl a few minutes after you mix in the thickener
combined with sugar, points out Yockelson. If you have very juicy
fruit  &UR; _ &LR;  like peaches  &UR; _ &LR;  you'll see a lot of juice at the bottom
and may need to adjust the amount of thickener.
</P>
<P>
   Yockelson  &UR; _ &LR;  whose first consideration is one of taste and gel
 &UR; _ &LR;  uses flour (which she refers to as an old-time, readily
available thickener) with some acidic fruits like sour cherries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sour cherry pie (you end up with) is not that cloudy. It
doesn't have the vivid (color) tone of a pie made with cornstarch,
but I like the mouth feel of the flour thickener
 &UR; _ &LR;  and it condenses the juices of the pie and cuts well.''
</P>
<P>
   But other times  &UR; _ &LR;  in apple and deep-dish peach pies, for
instance  &UR; _ &LR;  she opts for cornstarch, which binds well and has a
lighter feeling to it. She avoids quick-cooking tapioca as she
doesn't like the little pellets you end up with in the pie  &UR; _ &LR;  and
even if the tapioca is pulverized in the food processor before
using, she has found the results less than satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   A lattice-top fresh peach pie article in the July/August issue
of Cook's Illustrated touts using potato starch as a thickener.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potato starch scored big: its clarity outshone flour but
was less cosmetically glossy than cornstarch; its thickening
qualities rivaled tapioca in their strength and neutrality; and
still better there was no need for pulverizing.'' The article also
noted that if potato starch isn't available, an equal amount of
pulverized Minute tapioca can be substituted.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever thickener you decide to use, remember that flour and
cornstarch can't be used interchangeably in terms of amounts. One
tablespoon of cornstarch is the equivalent of two tablespoons
all-purpose flour.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to whip up something that takes less time and energy
than a fruit pie, try cobblers, crisps or crumbles. In a cobbler,
the fruit is covered with biscuit dough  &UR; _ &LR;  either rolled out or
dropped  &UR; _ &LR;  and then baked until golden. In crisps, you avoid dough
altogether, topping instead with a mixture of butter, sugar, flour
and sometimes nuts and then baking. Cookie crumbs, graham cracker
crumbs and buttered bread crumbs can also be used. In a crumble,
the fruit is topped with a mixture of butter, brown sugar, flour
and oats and then baked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cobblers have been my standard casual company dessert for
years,'' writes author Pam Anderson in her ``The Perfect Recipe''
cookbook. ``Enriched with whipped cream or ice cream, they taste as
good as a fruit pie and can be assembled much more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice is yours. Showcase this season's ripe, juicy fresh
fruits in some of these delectable ways. &QL;

CAMPAIGN-FINANCE CONTROL: JUST AIM FOR WALLET, SQUEEZE
</HEADLINE>
  By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   It's only July, but the best quote
of the 2000 political campaign may well belong to Mike Kelleher, a
Democrat running for Congress in Illinois. He's gleefully
circulating an old photo of a paper clip that his opponent,
Republican Timothy Johnson, sometimes used to hold his electronic
voting button in the ``yes'' position while he was away from his
seat in the state legislature.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Voting is the reason you are elected, and he delegated that
responsibility to a piece of office supply,'' says Kelleher, who's
created a Web site at www.timspaperclip.com. ``This goes to
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but voters in Illinois probably should count
themselves lucky if it's only a piece of office supply calling the
shots on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans recently celebrated the dubious
achievement of raising more than a quarter of a billion dollars for
this fall's congressional races. For that much money, every man,
woman and child in America could get a whole box of paper clips to
represent them. (I'd suggest we pool our resources, though, and get
something with a little more weight and personality like, say, a
lava lamp.)
</P>
<P>
   The torrent of cash _ and special-interest influence _ shows no
signs of letting up, of course. In fact, officials in both major
parties are boldly declaring they ought to be allowed to raise
more, not less money.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the leaders of some 527s _ the groups that have been
exploiting Section 527 of the tax code to hide the names of people
funneling money into campaigns _ said they may defy a new law
requiring them to state who they are and how much they're spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intentions of submitting to this,'' William Wilson,
spokesman for a 527 called the Council for Responsible Government,
recently told The Center for Public Integrity. ``I won't let John
McCain or anyone else tell us who we can and can't support. I won't
roll over on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Majority Issues Committee, a 527 promoted by
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, is among the law's critics.
</P>
<P>
   James Bopp, an attorney for the group, portrays it as a simple
matter of free speech. ``I'm never surprised when politicians get
together to shut up citizens who want to talk about their voting
records,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The citizens in question are primarily of the wealthy, corporate
sort. Despite their success and already considerable influence, it
appears they're actually quite shy and uncomfortable speaking in
public. Rather endearing, isn't it? Perish the thought that they're
really trying to dodge questions about whether the politicians they
support are writing legislation on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman DeLay wants to help coax those donors out of their
shells even more. During a speech last week at the Cato Institute,
a think tank in Washington D.C., he called for the repeal of all
limits on donations. That's right _ all limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfettered political speech, along with the right to bear
arms, is the most certain means we possess of protecting the rest
of our freedoms,'' DeLay said. (Wouldn't that make a fine bumper
sticker on Capitol Hill? ``I support just one type of
campaign-finance control: Aim for the wallet and squeeze.'')
</P>
<P>
   In a paper-clip twist of logic, DeLay argues that limits protect
incumbents like him because challengers can't raise enough money to
win. So if we lift the limits _ and create the campaign equivalent
of the old nuclear-arms race policy of Mutually Assured Destruction
_ everybody would have a shot at bidding on the candidate of their
choice.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay recently told The Washington Post that the only folks who
want to impose caps on campaign donations are journalists,
``big-government liberals'' and ``politicians trying to make
friends with journalists and big-government liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   And voters, it would seem. A recent Gallup poll indicates that
62 percent of Americans favor public financing of campaigns, the
highest level since Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Four states now have ``clean election'' laws that give
candidates public funds to run for office, in exchange for
declining special-interest money. Similar measures appear close to
passage in seven other states, according to USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts may not be the best approach to reform. But I'm
willing to wager that the folks who get elected under such measures
will represent us better than paper clips and maybe even lava
lamps.

RASPBERRY BROWNIE COBBLER
</HEADLINE>
 Here is a dessert for people who have trouble deciding between
fruit and chocolate  _  raspberries topped with chocolate-nut
batter rather than the usual oats or crumbs. It's best served warm,
so pop it in the oven a little before you sit down to dinner and
serve about an hour later, with vanilla ice cream, if desired. 
2 1/2 ounces bittersweet (not unsweetened chocolate) 
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into several pieces 
1/2 cup walnuts 
1 pint fresh raspberries 
1 cup sugar 
2 large eggs 
1/2 teaspoon vanilla 
7 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
1 pint vanilla ice cream, softened a bit (optional)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Put 2 inches of water in saucepan or bottom of double boiler and
bring to a bare simmer. Combine chocolate and butter in stainless
steel bowl and place on top of simmering water, making sure water
doesn't touch bowl. Heat, whisking occasionally, until chocolate
and butter are completely melted.
</P>
<P>
   While chocolate is melting, coarsely chop nuts. Spray 8-inch
square baking dish with cooking spray. Scatter berries across
bottom of dish.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk together sugar, eggs and vanilla in bowl. Whisk in melted
chocolate. Stir in flour, nuts and salt. Pour batter over berries
and smooth with spatula.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven until a toothpick inserted
into center of cobbler comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let stand
15 minutes and serve with ice cream if desired. Makes 6 to 8
servings.

 Learning to Cook: Day-Old Bread's Not for the Birds   By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Bread salad is a perfect example of old-fashioned
home cooking at its best.
<P>
   In the old days (any era in which the living was not easy), it
was a sin to let anything go to waste, so thrifty housewives
devised clever ways to recycle foodstuff that was past its prime.
Bread salad was a dish born of necessity, and is a dandy way to use
up stale bread.
</P>
<P>
   Today's recipe is an adaptation of the classic Tuscan bread
salad, which is popular to this day. And in these times of relative
affluence, the bread starts out fresh and is allowed to get stale.
</P>
<P>
   To make the best salad, I use a good, hearty loaf of artisan
bread. There are a number of small local bakeries that produce
these breads, and many supermarkets carry them, too. Whatever bread
you choose, be sure it has a sturdy texture _ avoid those wimpy,
soft loaves of sliced white bread.
</P>
<P>
   Since bread salad is simple and economical, you can go all out
on the ingredients: flavorful vine-ripened tomatoes, plump fresh
garlic, a crisp cucumber (wax-free), a sweet red onion, lush
peppery watercress and the best olive oil you can find.
</P>
<P>
   In line with the ``waste-not, want-not'' origin of the dish, if
you have any left over, cover it and put it in the refrigerator.
The next morning, you've got a satisfying, summery breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BREAD SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 or 5 large, ripe, juicy tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   3 large garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 red onion
</P>
<P>
   1 cucumber
</P>
<P>
   Salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 loaf of day-old French or other country-style bread (to yield
3 to 4 cups cubes)
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch watercress
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Preparing the vegetables:  &LR; Rinse the tomatoes and cut out
the cores. Cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise. Put the halves
cut-side down on a chopping board. Cut each half lengthwise into
1/2-inch strips. Holding the strips together, cut them crosswise
into 1/2-inch pieces. Put the chopped tomatoes into a large bowl
and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the garlic and cut each clove into tiny lengthwise strips,
then hold the strips together and cut crosswise into tiny pieces.
Add to the tomatoes in the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the papery skin off the onion half. Trim off the stem top
and root bottom. Place the onion half cut-side down on a cutting
board and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch strips. Holding the strips
together, cut them into 1/4-inch pieces. Add the onion to the salad
bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the cucumber and cut it in half lengthwise down the center.
Using a teaspoon, scrape out the seeds and discard. Cut each
cucumber half into 4 lengthwise strips, then cut crosswise into
1/2-inch pieces. Add the cucumber pieces to the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Season the vegetables with salt. Use your hands to toss and mix

<P>
   Pour the vinegar into a small bowl. Add the olive oil and whisk

 Secrets Of Success: Betelnut's Specialty   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Cecilia Chiang, who owned the pioneering Mandarin
restaurant in Ghirardelli Square for 30 years, invented this recipe
for Minced Chicken in Lettuce Cups served at Betelnut, a restaurant
that specializes in food from all over Asia, including Vietnam,
Thailand and Singapore.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a take-off on the minced squab that was the signature dish
at the Mandarin. For Betelnut, which was designed to look like a
sexy back-alley speakeasy in Shanghai, Chiang wanted to use less
expensive ingredients, so she replaced the squab with chicken. The
dark meat in particular has a similar flavor and texture. It's a
wonderful blend featuring minced chicken, crunchy water chestnuts,
black mushrooms, Chinese sausage and toasted pine nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Chiang seasons the mixture with ginger, soy sauce and oyster
sauce and serves the warm stir-fry in crisp, cold iceberg lettuce
cups.
</P>
<P>
   I particularly like to add a little dollop of plum sauce to the
lettuce leaf before adding the hot chicken mixture. To eat, just
pick up the lettuce leaf and eat as you would a taco. The
combination of the hot, fragrant chicken and the crisp, cold
lettuce is a true culinary delight.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Betelnut, 2030 Union St. (near Buchanan), San Francisco (415) &LR; 
 &LR; 929-8855. Lunch and dinner daily. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECRETS OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ The egg white. &LR;  Adding egg white to the chicken before frying
in a hot wok gives that moist, velvety coating so admired in
Chinese cooking.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ The lettuce cups. &LR;  Trim the leaves with scissors into round
cups and make sure they are well chilled to enhance the contrast
with the hot chicken.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; MINCED CHICKEN IN LETTUCE CUPS
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to splurge, replace one-fifth of the chicken
with squab.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 head iceberg lettuce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dried black mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound boneless skinless chicken thighs, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 egg white
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely minced fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely minced water chestnuts
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely minced Chinese sausage (see Note)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon oyster sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 scallions, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   Asian sesame oil, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon pine nuts, toasted
</P>
<P>
   Plum sauce
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Remove the core from the lettuce and gently separate the leaves.
Use a knife or scissors to cut the leaves into cup shapes.
Refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   Place the mushrooms in a small bowl. Add enough hot water to
cover. Let soak until soft, about 1 hour. Drain, reserving the
mushroom-soaking liquid. Cut off and discard the mushroom stems.
Finely chop the caps.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the chicken, soy sauce, egg white and cornstarch in a
large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or skillet over high heat. Add
the chicken mixture and ginger and cook until the chicken loses its
translucency, about 3 minutes. Add the rehydrated mushrooms, water
chestnuts and sausage. Reduce heat to low. Stir in the oyster
sauce, scallions and white pepper. If the mixture seems too dry,
add enough of the reserved mushroom-soaking liquid to moisten.
Remove from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle with sesame oil.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon the mixture onto a platter. Sprinkle with pine nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with the chilled lettuce cups and small bowls of plum
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To eat:  &LR; Each diner takes a lettuce cup, adds a dab of plum
sauce, spoons in some of the filling, then eats the delicacy like a
taco.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>

   &UR; Note:  &LR; Chinese sausage (lop chong) is available at Asian
markets.

 Wine Potpourri: Pierce's Disease Poses Threat to Growers  By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Over the years the California wine industry has
battled many problems _ weather that can't be controlled and pests
that can't be understood, not to mention human pests in the form of
government and social pressures.
<P>
   Now along comes a two-prong attack on a small California wine
region that is forcing wineries to reassess their survival.
Temecula Valley in Southern California is ground zero for one of
the most dynamic battles between the forces of wine and the
inexorable pressures of nature and society.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1970s, Temecula has been under the thumb of
mounting commercial and residential pressure to expand and develop
the land currently used for vineyards. Then in 1998, Pierce's
Disease appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's Disease is a bacterial disease that attacks and kills
grape vines. There is no known cure. In the early 20th century, PD
destroyed 39,500 acres of grapevines, mainly in Southern
California. Another epidemic broke out in the 1930s and now the
scourge of the millennium has hit Temecula hard.
</P>
<P>
   The small Santa Cruz Mountain wine district also has been hit by
PD, and the disease has been seen in other North Coast vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway Winery, Temecula's largest, has had it with unyielding
development and the ravages of Pierce's Disease. According to Mike
Jellison, president of Allied Domecq Wines USA, Callaway's parent
company is shifting its main source of grapes to the Central Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting to produce 300,000 cases by 2001, Callaway would soon
outgrow the present supply of Temecula grapes, with or without PD.
To continue to meet demand for its wines, the winery, which
ultimately aims to reach 1 million cases, was forced to buy
cool-climate grapes from Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and
Monterey counties.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway's change in grape sourcing will surely change the style
and flavor profile of the wines, and fits in with part of a general
makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Labels on the new Callaway Coastal wines sport muted watercolors
of subtle sunbursts emblazoned with the Callaway Coastal name. The
line of $8 wines will include Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon,
Merlot, Sauvignon and Chenin Blanc. Coastal Reserves, at $12, will
include Viognier, Chardonnay and Merlot. A $4 million advertising
campaign in the fall will announce the makeover.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Temecula Reaction &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at Davis has established a Pierce's
Disease Task Force to deal with the threat to the California wine
industry. The federal government has already added $22 million to
the $15 million from the state to fight the disease. Winemakers and
growers are optimistic that current experiments will help control
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be a bit of coincidental irony, a new winery is
moving into Temecula just as Callaway is moving out. Ray and
Loretta Falkner's Falkner Winery will produce an ambitious line of
wines, including eight varietals and two proprietary blends, most
of which will come from Temecula fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The Falkners, who are moving to California from Texas, did not
come into Temecula blind to the problem. ``We did some very
thorough research before buying and are confident that we made the
right decision,'' Ray Falkner says.
</P>
<P>
   The Falkners claim that the winery owners in Temecula they spoke
with are more upbeat about the PD situation than what is generally
reported. Joe Hart, a Temecula veteran, is one of those optimists.
Hart, who has owned Hart Winery in the valley since 1980, has mixed
emotions on the PD problem and what it is doing to the image of
Temecula wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are going to come through this whole thing,'' he
says. ``The impact depends on how successful we are at controlling
PD.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart's Winery, at 5,000 cases per year, and the Falkners' new
winery, projecting 6,500 cases, are relatively small operations, as
are most in Temecula. In this case, size does matter. It's much
easier for small wineries to get healthy Temecula grapes than for a
large winery like Callaway.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, who has won many awards for his delightful Grenache
Ros &LR; e &LR; , focuses on Mediterranean-style wines like Grenache,
Viognier and Syrah, varieties that are thought to do better in the
area than Chardonnay. For now, he says there is no shortage of
Temecula grapes, but he worries about the future. ``Wineries
outside the valley don't want to buy Temecula grapes because of the
PD scare,'' he says. ``It's a tough situation for the growers.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Callaway move to source all of their grapes outside
Temecula, Hart believes, ``It is not a good thing for the rest of
us. From a business perspective, it looks to me like Callaway is
moving down-market by going from a Temecula appellation to the more
general Coastal appellation.''

 CHRON  
 THE LAST OF THE INDEPENDENTS: Neighborhood markets are alive
and  well and holding their own against the big guys.   By Karola Saekel 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Warehouse clubs and online grocery shopping are
touted as the wave of the future, but they are causing barely a
ripple in the tranquil shopping pond of the Bay Area's last great
independent grocers.
<P>
   We are not talking mom and pop stores here, but a handful of
medium-sized, full-service, high-end markets that have not only
survived the sea change in consumer shopping habits, but are
thriving in the new climate.
</P>
<P>
   Their basic strategy is a combination of two seemingly opposite
approaches _ they employ the most advanced 21st century
merchandising methods while keeping the old-fashioned values of
service and individual attention.
</P>
<P>
   To their loyalists, the advertising slogan of that online
shopping service promising never having to set foot in a grocery
store again sounds more like a threat than a bright promise: They
like to go to their grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel the energy _ with the runners and the cyclists
stopping by on the weekends,'' says a longtime Woodside resident of
that town's own cherished market, Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vital part of the community, she says. You know the
people there and they know you. Regular customers _ and most
Woodside residents are regulars _ have accounts, so ``you can just
pop in and pick up something, or kids can charge a sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the number of full-service, upscale grocery
stores has dwindled, to be sure. Some, like San Francisco's Ashbury
Market and the Marina Super on Chestnut Street, have thrown in the
towel. Others, like Andronico's and Draeger's, have grown from
one-location stores into prosperous regional mini-chains. But there
is still a solid core of single-outlet stores that serve a
particular community or neighborhood and are still the top dog on
their special turf.
</P>
<P>
   These successful survivors share a number of traits:
</P>
<P>
   _ They are in relatively affluent and stable neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   _ They are family-owned and family-run.
</P>
<P>
   _ They have updated their stores, so while they may retain a
certain old-fashioned air, they never look outdated.
</P>
<P>
   _ They employ the latest merchandising techniques.
</P>
<P>
   _ They stay in the culinary and nutritional forefront,
frequently featuring organic labels and products from local artisan
producers.
</P>
<P>
   _ They carry large selections of locally baked breads and
outstanding arrays of produce.
</P>
<P>
   _ They cater to customers, responding to requests and criticisms
in a way larger organizations cannot match.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to widely held beliefs, they are  &LR; not &LR;  geared to the
rich and famous. True, specialty items _ fresh white asparagus,
free-range chicken, fruit preserves cooked in small batches,
hormone- and antibiotic-free beef, handmade farm cheeses _ cost
more than their plebeian counterparts. But on a one-on-one,
equal-quality comparison basis, the independents don't charge
appreciably more than the chain markets (see chart). In other
words, if you come for the specialty items, you might as well save
time and gasoline and do at least most of your shopping here.
</P>
<P>
   We picked five such grocers as typical of this possibly
endangered but still thriving species. They all share the above
characteristics, yet each has its own individual style.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; CAL-MART, SAN FRANCISCO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The banks of cut flowers and potted plants running the length of
the store send a clear signal that this is not your cookie-cutter
generic supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Located in San Francisco's Laurel Village, the nearly
50-year-old store is still owned and run by the Giampoli family and
has stayed true to its green roots.
</P>
<P>
   The father of current owners Ronald and Joseph Giampoli's
father, the senior Joseph Giampoli, started in the produce business
in North Beach and the Marina, and produce of impeccable quality is
still a major focus. But the market also carries the staples, from
canned soup to kitty litter, interspersing them with imports and
small-producer products like Hegg &AMP; Hegg canned shad roe, fancy sea
salts, Lucca ravioli, The Well-Fed Baby organic frozen baby food,
Grannyola cereal and Ciao Bella ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   The small bakery, Sweet Things, is a concession, as is the large
meat, poultry and seafood counter. This is a market where butchers
still cut meat to order and are trained to advise customers.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch hour and in the late afternoon, the deli counter sees
most of the action. From sandwiches to interesting salads to
stuffed cabbage rolls and moussaka, this is the place to assemble a
lunch or a no-hassle dinner. And although this is a favorite
shopping spot of the Pacific Heights set, prices are down-to-earth.
That moussaka is $5.99 per pound.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Cal-Mart, 3585 California St. (near Spruce Street), San &LR; 
 &LR; Francisco; (415) 751-3516. Open 8 a.m.-8 p.m. Monday-Saturday; &LR; 
 &LR; 8:30 a.m.-6:30 p.m. Sunday. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WOODLANDS MARKET, KENTFIELD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What will it be for dinner? Spanakopita, grilled sea scallops or
Oriental beef stir-fry, chicken Marsala or grilled Cornish game
hens, or maybe something homey like chicken pot pie or corn
pudding?
</P>
<P>
   You can get it all at Woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really a hybrid of a restaurant and a supermarket,''
says manager Gary Grosetti. And indeed, like in an eclectic
restaurant, this pretty, airy market's three professional chefs
cater to global tastes. They produce party platters ranging from
$39 for chicken satay skewers to $89.99 for either grilled beef
tenderloin or smoked salmon.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy entrees like ravioli in family- or party-sized
trays, or purchase a portion for just one. And if you are too
hungry to cart your purchase home, the store offers outside picnic
tables.
</P>
<P>
   Before you head for home, you might pop into the Woodlands-owned
separate flower shop to pick up a plant or a bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   For all these fancy features, Woodlands, created from a
remodeled and expanded small grocery in 1985 by owner Don Santa, is
still a regular market with all the staples. You can purchase
ordinary packaged bread as well as artisan loaves, and the produce
display holds iceberg lettuce alongside designer greens.
</P>
<P>
   Woodlands, like other fine independents, is strong on community
connections and customer service. There is a much-used bulletin
board and the store publishes a monthly newsletter. A professional
wine buyer is on hand to guide shoppers, and there are Friday and
Saturday tastings in the in-house wine bar. This Friday will
feature Bordeaux wines. Hours are 5-7 p.m. (4-6 p.m. on Saturdays);
and there is a nominal charge, but reservations are not required.
</P>
<P>
   Should a customer have concerns about health-related topics,
nutritionist Helen Roe holds forth in a small booth near the front
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Woodlands Market, 735 College Ave. (near Sir Francis Drake &LR; 
 &LR; Boulevard), Kentfield; (415) 457-8160. Open 8 a.m.-8 p.m. &LR; 
 &LR; daily.cq &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; BROWNS VALLEY MARKET, NAPA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Off the tourist-trodden main roads of the Napa Valley, this is
the favorite store for the Browns Valley as well as the Carneros
district. Owner Jerry Giovannoni grew up here. ``I used to ride
horses where now there's nothing but subdivisions,'' he says.
Twenty years ago, his father built the small shopping center in
which the market is located.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a neighborhood store,'' Giovannoni says. ``Ninety-five
percent of our business comes from folks who live right here.''
Once an area known for grazing land and extensive orchards, with
sky-rocketing land values the choice now seems to be either housing
developments or vineyards, and his market caters to the new,
sophisticated customer.
</P>
<P>
   The bread selection is extensive, including loaves from Acme,
Artisancq &LR; , Della Fattoria, House of Bread, Panorama and Sonoma
French Bakery.
</P>
<P>
   The wine section shows similar local orientation, featuring many
wineries whose owners or winemakers are among the market's
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Giovannoni added a large deli that offers dinner
entrees, almost all made on-site. There are tortas and tamales and
prepackaged containers of entrees like pork-fried rice or beef
Stroganoff. The service meat department also accommodates today's
short-on-time consumer with such options as succulent marinated
chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma-grown, the birds are labeled ``natural'' _ and that's an
important word here. This community, says the grocer, is savvy and
concerned with nutrition issues.
</P>
<P>
   And the community is what the store is all about, he says. He
points to the store's support of local schools, including
sponsorship of the Browns Valley Market Falcons, a junior girls
softball team.
</P>
<P>
   Giovannoni is optimistic about the future of stores such as his
and doesn't worry much about competition from chains and club
stores. ``Customers go there once a week,'' he says. ``They come
here every day.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Browns Valley Market, 3263 Browns Valley Rd. (near Austin &LR; 
 &LR; Way), Napa; (707) 253-1873. Open 8 a.m.-9 p.m. daily. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; VILLAGE MARKET, OAKLAND &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At 4,000 square feet, this is one of the smallest of the upscale
independents and is located in a largely residential area in
Oakland's Montclair district.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jim Trimble's mantra obviously isn't ``location, location,
location'' _ his market generates no walk-by and little, if any,
drive-by traffic. Rather, it's ``service, service, service.'' And
with that, the family, which includes his wife, Janie, and son,
Joseph, who both work in the store, managed to build a loyal core
of customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Trimbles make good use of the space they have. Indoors,
fruits and vegetables are stacked high in barrels and on terra
cotta coasters, creating a tempting still life in a very compact
area. The produce spills over into a large outdoor display, but
increasing the size of the display is not the sole motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Trimble says a great produce section should appeal to all
the senses, and the non-refrigerated outdoor area adds the
sensation of smell, which is lacking in traditional icy indoor
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Jim Trimble became a founding member and first
president of a group of 17 non-chain markets called Raise the Bar,
which aims to improve customer service by educating and motivating
staff. The grocers employ a full-time consultant and make use of
the services of a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble relentlessly follows up on customer requests. He has no
space for an in-house deli but does operate a rotisserie. He
assembles prepared foods and specialty items from outstanding small
producers _ artisan cheeses from Petaluma; Lisa Lerner chocolates
from Berkeley; scones and preserves from nearby Montclair Baking;
Gianna's pastries from Sand City near Monterey; cakes from Rubicon
of Richmond and more. He also buys fresh produce direct from a
dozen nearby farms.
</P>
<P>
   Packaged entrees and salads are displayed opposite the small
service fish/meat counter. Packaged meat and poultry include
top-of-the-line Harris beef and Diestel turkeys. A recently added
concession, a compact sushi bar, makes sushi to order.
</P>
<P>
   Village has a small section of British foods, including
Britain's beloved salad cream and canned mushy peas.
</P>
<P>
   How can Trimble spare the space for such oddities? He orders
only specific items that customers request, rather than a
producer's entire line.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran grocer (he worked for Albertsons before taking over
and revamping Village Market in 1974) says the heart and soul of
his operation is a little stand-up desk and bulletin board with
request forms. If customers include their phone numbers, they get a
reply via phone. If not, the answer is written at the bottom of the
request slip, which is then posted.
</P>
<P>
   One recent note read: ``Could you please keep H &LR; a &LR; agen-Dazs
low-fat vanilla ice cream in stock? We need it.'' The reply: ``We
have talked to the delivery man.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Village Market, 5885 Broadway Terrace (at Clarewood Drive), &LR; 
 &LR; Oakland; (510) 547-3200. Open 7 a.m.-9 p.m. Monday-Saturday; 8 &LR;

   You can park your 10-speed bike or tie up your steed outside the
market and slip inside for a latte or a smoothie from the coffee
bar. You can also pick up a bottle of fine Rhone-style wine from
the Santa Cruz Mountains, thick-as-molasses aged balsamic vinegar,
a loaf of ciabatta, or a heat-and-eat tray of pot roast, mashed
potatoes and vegetables.

   Roberts is an all-purpose grocery, specialty market and
community center in one _ the bulletin board displays official
notices and personal announcements from the lost-cat to the
sublet-wanted variety.
</P>
<P>
   In a charmingly old-fashioned vein, customers have numbered
personal charge accounts. No plastic cards here; you just write
your account number on the register slip.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way we have always done it,'' says Christine
Roberts, the fourth generation of the Roberts family to work in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in the 1880s at California Street and Divisadero in San
Francisco by William Roberts, grandson George, the current owner,
moved the operation to the Peninsula 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among changes in the past four decades is the growth of
prepared food. ``You just cannot have enough of it,'' says
Christine Roberts, who is in charge of specialty foods.
</P>
<P>
   She points to such prepared dinners as the pot roast (about $7
per person), many house-made salads (curried turkey is a favorite)
and several dozen sandwiches that range from turkey or pastrami
($4.50 each) to such specialties as rosemary garlic chicken breast
with sundried tomato ai &LR; o &LR; li, lettuce, tomato and onion ($5.25) and
fresh mozzarella and tomato with basil, lettuce and Italian
dressing on a ciabatta roll ($6.25). There are 16 choices of bread.
</P>
<P>
   The lunch crush can be intense, so Roberts recently added
on-line sandwich service. Customers can e-mail and fax in orders
and pick them up at the smoothie bar. This no-wait service caught
on fast, Christine Roberts says. ``After all, we are right on the
edge of Silicon Valley.''

   HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. _ Every day, thousands of people abandon the
hell they think they are living in and travel in search of a
paradise where they imagine every kind of happiness is possible.
And what they often find, if they get there at all, is another
hell, even worse than the one they left.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to the 60 Chinese migrants who paid their
lifesavings to submit to a four-month odyssey that began in Fujian
Province, China, and ended June 18 in the sealed container of a
Dutch cargo truck aboard a ferry crossing the English Channel.
Anchored in front of the white cliffs of Dover, England, only two
men survived while the rest died of suffocation on the warmest day
of the English summer.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar, though with a more fortunate outcome,
happened to Iraqi Tara Mohammed. He walked barefoot from his home
in Kirkuk to the Turkish border, hiding by day in sewers and barns
and walking at night. After a week, with the soles of his feet raw,
he arrived in Istanbul, where he found a truck driver who accepted
the $4,000 dollars he had sown to his shirt in exchange for
dropping him ``anywhere in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidden in the closed trailer truck among gradually rotting
produce, he arrived very dehydrated in Dover. By coincidence, his
arrival was on the same day the English authorities found the
bodies of the dead Chinese migrants. Moved by his plight, the
immigration officers allowed him to stay in the London ``paradise''
for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Life in this world has never been fair, but perhaps it hasn't
been as unfair as it is now. Out of the 6 billion people on this
planet, the richest one-fifth receives 86 percent of all the income
produced, while the poorest one-fifth retains only 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme differences have also created extreme fantasies. For
the poor, happiness will always be somewhere else: '' ... no matter
where, as long as it is far from this world,'' as Baudelaire wrote
in Le Spleen de Paris.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 19th century, whole families migrated from
Europe, which at that time was a continent without hope, and
traveled to Argentina, Brazil, the United States. The majority were
Italians, Germans, Irish, Spaniards, Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, migration flows in every direction, but especially
from the peripheral countries to industrial nations. And it is
usually only one member of a family at a time, because there's not
enough money to pay for other family members, too.
</P>
<P>
   But happiness, and even poverty, is relative. What is unbearable
for some may be coveted by others. In Mar del Plata, Argentina's
beautiful Atlantic coast city, the unemployment rate has reached 19
percent, and so one-tenth of the population has migrated in the
last two years. Thousands of young people currently wait for an
Italian or Spanish passport so they can travel to the homelands of
their grandfathers to search for a job.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago Bolivian farmer Fidencio Choque traveled from
Tarija, Bolivia, to Escobar, Argentina, 40 kilometers north of
Buenos Aires. For him there's no better place in the world than the
fertile land near Mar del Plata. The free education he always
wanted for his sons and grandsons is still the best in the Americas
_ and he is right about that _ and bread, though sometimes not in
great quantity, is always on his table.
</P>
<P>
   Things were never easy for 31-year-old Choque. With a heart
tattooed on his chest, he settled in Escobar as a hired hand on one
of the area's many vegetable farms. After years of toil he was
finally able to rent 3 hectares of land for 300 pesos a month,
where he grows vegetables that he takes to market. He and 12
members of his family live in a little house with no windows,
bathroom or electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But these ``nothings'' were enough to inflame the envy of
others. Early on June 23, 10 armed and masked men broke into the
house, beat Fidencio for two hours and seared off his tattoo with a
white-hot iron. Aware the Choque family had no bank account _ it
seemed pointless for so little, Fidencio thought _ the thieves, who
some say were policemen, took whatever they found in the house,
including the family's lifesavings of $3,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In pain from internal injuries, hurt and terrified, Fidencio's
only desire now is to forget that nightmare and return to the
bountiful prairies of Mar del Plata, the place which so many young
men are so eager to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Borders are porous everywhere, and human beings cross illegally
any way they can. Their passage can take them through open air
sewers like those of El Bordo, in Tijuana, Mexico, or old ducts, or
aboard rickety boats like those that leave Tortuga Island, Haiti,
to cross the Caribbean Sea in storm season. Or they are hidden on
cargo boats and trains and in sealed containers such as the one in
which the Chinese met their death at Dover.
</P>
<P>
   It cost the Choque family very little money to travel to
Argentina. But the Chinese who want to journey to Europe are not so
lucky. The average cost of getting a Chinese to any place in the
European Union, fake passport included, is $25,000 dollars. Even
with that price, the migrants may have to wait two or three months
in seedy hotel rooms in Belgium or Moscow, surviving on only bread
and water.
</P>
<P>
   However, this price is merely half the amount charged for
smuggling humans into the United States. Which explains why
families send only one young man from the village, in the hopes
he'll save enough to allow the migration of another. The Chinese
estimate that if the young man works an average of 15-16 hours, six
days a week, he can earn in a month what it would take him a year
to earn in China.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has to pay, no matter the distance. A man from Central
America has to come up with $2,000 dollars to cross from Tijuana to
Los Angeles, which is 20 percent more than what Mexicans have to
pay, and 90 percent of them have to suffer indignities and abuse
before crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
   This flow of human beings is now one of the most lucrative
trades in the world. More than $3 billion dollars change hands each
month just in illegal migration to the European Union. If the
situation doesn't improve, it will be an even greater and more
lucrative business than the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Rich countries are frequently intolerant of the foreigners who
arrive in search of a job. They don't stop to think that the
decision to risk everything in a perilous journey to an unknown
land, without knowing its customs or language, shows a bold courage
and will to survive worthy of admiration and respect. Exodus is
almost always born of desperation, but other motivations include
ambition, family unity and the ultimate dream of becoming
``someone'' in this life.
</P>
<P>
   Opening borders to anyone of good will was a utopian goal in the
19th century, but in this era of supreme inequality it can no
longer be. Nevertheless, a humane and sensible migration policy is
something that cannot be postponed any longer, because today's tide
could turn into tomorrow's flood.
</P>
<P>
   When Tara Mohammed reached Dover, he said simply that his only
aspiration was ``to live like the English.'' One doesn't have to
think hard to understand that to live ``like others'' is one of the
most legitimate rights of the human species _ and perhaps the least
attainable.

 PHILADELPHIA: ... gently titled.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few would deny this city's artistic muscle. Certain sections of
the city have a decidely bohemian feel. The theater scene is
lively. Writer and poetry workshops thrive.
</P>
<P>
   One of America's finest, unsung poets resides here. Sonia
Sanchez is wearing loopy earrings and headdress. ``The people who
work on murals are amazing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Murals climb up buildings in this city: Sinatra rises at the
corner of Broad and Wharton on the side of an old bingo building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pulse of this city are people who are sometimes never
seen,'' Sanchez says. ``They're not bigtime people.''
</P>
<P>
   Toni Conti is not a bigtime person. But she can sound like she
has the whole world in her mind. She's a housewife. And she's a
staunch defender of Philly against image, of a city with Mafia
figures lolling in and out of its history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks this is the house of the Mafia. It's not.
Philadelphia's got a dirty rap,'' she says. She's getting riled up;
the flesh on her arm is shaking. Toni Conti says she remembers when
hoods would patrol area fruit markets, and if you stole an apple,
orange, pear, anything, you got whupped. ``People had a grip.''
</P>
<P>
   Toni Conti's either the real thing, or she's been watching a lot
of ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, a big man named Al, drives up, parks the big
candy-cane red Lincoln Continental in front of the house. Al has a
cane and wheezes bad. Climbing the steps, he stops on step number
three to catch his wife in conversation. Toni has started talking
about the end of things, Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister knows a kid who doesn't believe in God,'' she says
in a tone both grave and astonished.
</P>
<P>
   Al raises his head, his eyes wide. A grave look claims his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll come a day when he believes in God,'' he intones.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1980 Toni Conti was a hockey mom for her son's team at
Central High School. One season the team desperately needed money.
She was walking around an outdoor market. A man handed her an
envelope, told her it was for the hockey team. She gets to her car
and opens it. Inside, three thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   She found out the money was from Chickie Narducci. ``He was
mob,'' she says. ``He was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   She shakes her head. Chickie Narducci. What a loss. (Chickie was
gunned down outside the US courthouse here in 1982. He was on trial
for racketeering).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only thing I resent,'' she says. ``Young kids today
don't hold their birthplace tight. And I wasn't raised prejudiced
either. I'm not prejudiced against blacks, whites, Asians.''
</P>
<P>
   Al goes inside, squeezing past the wife. Toni Conti goes back to
that hockey team. She traveled with them for four years, carried a
cowbell into every ice rink. When her son and his teammates heard
that cowbell, they knew where she was sitting. Not that her voice
didn't carry anyway. ``They told me in Harrisburg I couldn't ring
the cowbell. Let me tell you something, babycakes. We walked away
with the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Babycakes.
</P>
<P>
   Chickie Narducci.

   It wouldn't be a major metropolis without political corruption.
Without the sometime-hubris that brings a politician into the
clutches of the federal government after the familiar ritual of
wiretaps, backstabbings, confessions, and denials.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Tayoun hides in plain sight now.
</P>
<P>
   The feds got him back in 1991. He served a little over three
years for racketeering, mail fraud, obstruction of justice, and tax
evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Free again, he was a soon enough big man in this town, a city
councilman, a state rep, a mover. He ran for Congress twice. Lost
twice, but the legend didn't suffer.
</P>
<P>
   He's got an office where he puts together a newsletter. There
are old jazzy tunes crooning on the radio right now. Like a lot of
people, Jimmy Tayoun misses Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hustle,'' he says about his newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Friends _ old allies, old enemies _ keep dropping a little ad
business his way. ``We cover everything below the radar screen of
the dailies _ and they copy us.'' He cackles.
</P>
<P>
   He first got into politics in 1968. He charged right into crowds
_ blacks, whites, immigrant _ shaking hands, slapping backs. He
liked going into the housing projects. It got so folk would just
see him coming and cry his name out. (itals)Jimmy Tiiiunn!(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   He says the feds had it out to get him. ``I pleaded guilty to
everything,'' he says. ``I didn't have the money to fight. They
wanted to indict my wife and kids. . . . If I had O.J.'s money, I'd
of won. I'd be mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   He's behind the wheel of his car now, offering a tour of his
town. Driving through neighborhoods, the windows down, slowing,
waving, letting the greetings float to him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hey Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   Hiya Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   Tayoun!
</P>
<P>
   Hiya doing Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman. How you doing?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A life gone bad, but hardly gone. No sir.
</P>
<P>
   He points to some men sitting in front of a small building.
``This is a mob place,'' he says. ``Hey fellas.''
</P>
<P>
   Heads turn. They squint, and squint some more. Do they recognize
the great Jimmy Tayoun?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Tayoun, you blind bastards!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh. Hey. Jimmy. Hiya doing Jimmy.''
</P>
<P>
   He starts driving away. ``They can't see anymore,'' he laments.
``They don't wear glasses. It's vanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many who've done time and who have connections, Jimmy
Tayoun wrote a book. ``Going to Jail,'' it's titled. An outfit out
of Maine published it. ``It's in libraries,'' Jimmy Tayoun softly
brags. ``Criminal lawyers have bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   He turns down another street, looking and waving, human voices
chattering at him like insects.
</P>
<P>
   Another mob hangout. Pink arms rising and lowering like weak
tree limbs. ``The mob is a skeleton of what it used to be,'' he
offers. ``It used to be a second culture.''
</P>
<P>
   He says something dark about politics and the mob. ``The mob
sold me out,'' he says, eschewing elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about his old district. ``I had the entire waterfront
for approximately 13 miles. I had housing projects, blue collar
workers. Everybody loved me.''
</P>
<P>
   He's over near Indiana and 11th now. It's a tough neighborhood.
Never mind the toughness. It's a Tayoun neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a senior citizens building. I put that in.''
</P>
<P>
   You ask the name of the building to jot it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   He's rolling on.
</P>
<P>
   Three of his six children are doctors. While he was away in
prison, his wife, Delores, steadfastly stood by him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feds put me away for nothing,'' he says, curving around
another street corner. ``I could deliver 10,000 votes at the top of
my game. Guaranteed, like clockwork.''
</P>
<P>
   A prayer for Jimmy Tayoun then.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The Republicans will come and go. They will leave a city behind.
</P>
<P>
   The black man says he will indeed vote in the general election,
even though he believes a lot about modern politics is ``a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   The black man is alive to vote, you see, because the young white
man died.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Welton was walking home up Wharton street one day. He
could hardly breathe. Doctors told him he needed another heart.
</P>
<P>
   He worked his whole life here, a city traffic agent.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up near an Italian neighborhood. ``Everybody took care
of each other. We didn't have race fights.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Norma _ ``my sweetie'' _ nearly lost it when he was
diagnosed, he says. She went through as much pain as he did.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dec. 12, 1992, when the transplant happened. A
20-year-old white man had died in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't put this in you and say go home,'' he says,
pointing to his chest, the hidden heart.
</P>
<P>
   One life lost. Another life reborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``A psychiatrist asks you, `Why do you want to have this heart?'
I said, `I want to see my oldest grandson graduate high school and
go to college.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The grandson's name is Dustin Berke. He's just gone off to
college orientation in New York. Welton says the need to see his
grandson go to college willed him through surgery. ``This is why
I'm living,'' he says. ``I'm one of the lucky people that came
through this life. It's not always dollars and cents. It's the
peace. If I should go today, or tomorrow, I wouldn't mind. Life
don't owe me nothing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Welton has just dropped a tear.
</P>
<P>
   He swivels his head, looks up the street into the sunshine of
Philly. Norma, his sweetie, should be coming on home in a little
bit.

NADER NUDGES GORE TOWARD POPULISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Perhaps Vice President Al Gore finally has found a way to keep
consumer advocate Ralph Nader, the Green Party's presidential
choice, from cutting deep enough into the vice president's
Democratic base to cost Gore the presidency in a close battle with
Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign has become more populist.
</P>
<P>
   As the polls show, Gore has been closing the gap against Bush in
recent days, but his lead over Bush in California has been
shrinking, while Nader's numbers in California have been rising. No
heavy analysis is required to show that Nader, in effect, is eating
into Gore's lead in California, a state that is so vital that
neither candidate can win the general election without winning
there.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has Pat Buchanan, who is seeking to be the Reform Party's
candidate, as a potential lead-reducer in this election. But
Buchanan thus far has not proven to be as potentially harmful to
Bush's candidacy as Nader is to Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Gore had to come up with an antidote to Nader's
potentially damaging impact on the vice president's run for the
White House. And, based on early indications, Gore may have found
the answer : populism.
</P>
<P>
   Gore of late has begun to articulate the populist themes that
are at the core of the Democratic Party's philosophy, but which in
recent weeks have become the core of Nader's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gore has been stressing that Bush and the GOP are
for the rich and powerful, while his campaign is focused on such
working-family issues as an increase in the minimum wage and a
patients' bill of rights that allow HMO members to sue their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gore has begun to climb again in the national
polls, but California still will be a major concern for the Gore
camp as long as Nader appears to be cutting into Gore's lead in
that state. Nader, in effect, could be helping Bush to pull off an
upset if the race for California's electoral votes, the largest of
any state, gets close in the weeks leading up to the election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supporters felt encouraged when he finally began to
solidify his Democratic voter base. Now, they add, Gore must
continue to highlight the populist themes that appear to be helping
Nader's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nader has been making some inroads into the labor movement with
his theme of fighting the rich and powerful who would not be
working in the best interests of union workers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's latest efforts appear to be paying off; he received the
endorsement of the Sierra Club, one of the nation's largest
environmental groups. That endorsement will help him fend off
Nader, who has been making some gains with his strong
environmentalist views.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has been moving to keep Nader's poll numbers in low
single digits, he has been wise not to use Nader's name in these
efforts. It would not be helpful to Gore to use Nader's name as he
spars with him on populist issues. Doing so only would elevate
Nader's candidacy and perhaps alienate members of his own political
base for conducting what would be perceived as a negative attack on
a man of integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, of course, will need a little help from his friends to
keep Nader from eroding his base while the vice president focuses
his attention on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that help is likely to come from US Senator Edward M.
Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who will be a keynote speaker
at the Democratic National Convention next month in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's convention speech and post-convention theme is
expected to focus on the reasons to vote for Gore, including his
support for legislative issues such as the minimum-wage increase
and increased health benefit that will require his support as
president. Kennedy also will cite other reasons for Democrats to
support Gore, including his stance against the GOP's legislative
agenda, which would help big business and hinder organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   With less than three months left until the election after the
August convention, Gore knows he can ill afford to make the wrong
choice. He will know the fate of his choice within the next few
weeks.

DEMOCRATS LIKE CLINTON'S MOVES, BUT NOT HIS TIMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He keeps creeping back into the spotlight, making
announcements of giant proportions: a historic trade agreement with
Vietnam, a broad plan for prescription drug benefits, a huge
increase in federal budget surplus projections. And now, an
extended summit for Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   Few could blame President Clinton for wanting to end his term in
a whirlwind of success. Except, perhaps, supporters of Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore has fought to match Governor George W. Bush in national
polls, Clinton has cheered his vice president on, earlier this
month calling him ``by far the most influential and active vice
president in the history of the country.'' But by keeping active
himself, Clinton has stayed on the front pages, causing concern
among some Democrats that he is stealing critical air time instead
of quietly ceding center stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be helpful,'' said Dane Strother, a Democratic
strategist. ``To the degree that any attention is diverted from
Gore, it can't be helpful. But how do you tell Bill Clinton, `Hey,
quit being president'?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has long been a double-edged sword for his aspiring vice
president, of course. With soaring approval ratings and his
renowned political charm, Clinton is widely viewed as an asset, and
the shared accomplishments of their administration have become a
centerpiece of the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, strategists have worried about putting the two
men on the same platform, out of fear Gore might be dwarfed by
Clinton's overwhelming charisma. And of course the vice president
has had other reasons to distance himself from the president. Gore
often tells audiences he knows they've ``been disappointed'' by the
current president, a not-so-veiled attempt to dissociate himself
from the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the already complex relationship between Clinton and Gore
appears to have entered yet another phase in the days leading up to
the Democratic National Convention in August. Earlier in the year,
some Gore aides worried that Hillary Rodham Clinton would upstage
the presidential race with her bid for the New York Senate seat;
suddenly, several Democratic advisers admitted in interviews, the
concern is also about the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, Clinton has gone on national radio to
propose a $79 billion Medicare drug benefit, summoned reporters to
the Rose Garden to announce a new $4.2 trillion budget surplus
estimate, flown to Missouri to advocate patients' rights and to
Russia for arms talks with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin. He
even grabbed headlines in early July by designating Abraham
Lincoln's summer home a national monument.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made news in signing a law validating digital
signatures, and even more news when he promised to veto two
Republican tax cuts passed this month by Congress. And then, in
what has been described as a move to cement his legacy in world
history, the president embarked on his current project: ending the
52-year conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, a negotiation
that has been the focus of interntional attention for nearly two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic supporters, and many historians, argue the Middle
East peace summit rises far above domestic politics, and foreign
policy overall cannot be put aside just because a presidential
election is underway.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week near Camp David whether there were concerns the
president might be overshadowing Gore at a critical political
juncture, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart scoffed at the idea,
saying: ``I don't think there's anybody here thinking about
politics.'' Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore, said the vice
president accepts that Clinton still has a job to do. ``Foreign
policy is obviously going to be conducted out of the White House,''
Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the domestic issues that Clinton has continued to
champion, there are those who believe the increased exposure is a
direct benefit to Gore. Addressing the soaring costs of
prescription drugs is an issue central to the Gore campaign; if
Clinton, too, is stumping on that issue, ``it helps focus voters on
it, and that's helpful, because it's an issue we feel we can win,''
Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Democratic strategists said, several weeks
remain until the real kickoff to the presidential race, when a
sitting president might be expected to pass the baton in a more
noticeable way.
</P>
<P>
   After the Democratic convention _ during which planners are
arranging a symbolic ``baton-passing,'' akin to the ceremony in
1988 in which President Ronald Reagan handed off a torch to his
vice president, George Bush _ many Democrats say they hope Clinton
will transition into more of an advocacy role, campaigning not only
for Gore but also for congressional and Senate candidates
(especially a particular candidate in New York). If Clinton does
that, then the recent flurry of activity could be interpreted as
his final push, perhaps even orchestrated to benefit his fellow
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Clinton is doing is positioning himself to help Gore,''
said Sandy Maisel, political science professor at Colby College in
Maine. ``I didn't think it was possible two months ago that you
could get a rousing reception for Bill Clinton. But he has,
interestingly, turned himself around.''
</P>
<P>
   With all of Clinton's recent bill signings and international
travel, Maisel said, ``What has happened is he's started looking
presidential. He's not the amoral president. He's being covered in
a presidential way, and that's got to have a positive impact on
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some who question Clinton's motives in keeping
a hectic calendar, suspecting his renowned thirst for adventure may
be on display. Over the last two weeks, he has met virtually around
the clock with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, making, on two occasions, dramatic late-night
announcements about how the talks would proceed _ and dominating
the next day's news as a result. And should the summit ultimately
produce an agreement, the benefit to Gore may be distant, if at
all, several Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly doesn't hurt, but I don't know that it helps a
great deal,'' said Jody Powell, who was press secretary for
President Jimmy Carter during the first 1978 Camp David accords.
``Looking back to our experience, by the time we'd gotten all
through with it and got the peace treaty signed in the spring of
the next year, it didn't help us at all. And Carter was the one who
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is concern that Clinton may resist taking a lower
profile as his eight-year presidency comes to an end. Stu
Rothenberg, publisher of a political newsletter in Washington,
said, ``Clinton is obviously the kind of political animal who will
not go quietly into the night, if ever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'll ever fade into the background...Bill
Clinton is still very visible, and I expect him to be until he is
no longer president,'' Rothenberg said. ``This president likes to
be active and is always trying to put together some other policy
agenda or legislation or polical point. And Al Gore is going to
have to deal with it.''

GRAND JURY SAID TO PROBE TEAMSTER FILM CONTRACTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With Movies-Union; a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY AND STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal grand jury is investigating allegations that
local Teamsters Union officials extorted Hollywood producers who
filmed a series of box-office hits throughout New England,
according to sources familiar with the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are looking into whether moviemakers were
forced to hire a local company with alleged ties to organized crime
to provide rental vehicles _ such as wardrobe trailers _ on all
movie sets, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   They are also looking into whether union officials extorted
favors from movie producers and forced them to hire a small group
of hand-selected drivers .
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the grand jury subpoenaed records from Teamsters
Union Local 25, in Charlestown, detailing the union's contracts
with filmmakers of such hits as ``The Perfect Storm,'' ``The Cider
House Rules,'' ``Message in a Bottle'' and ``Good Will Hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, agents from the US Department of Labor's
division of labor and racketeering raided the Weymouth home of
James P. Flynn, the union's transportation coordinator, and seized
records relating to the movie industry, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Local 25 President George Cashman, a longtime fund-raiser for
Governor Paul Cellucci who was recently reappointed to the
Massachusetts Port Authority board of directors for another seven
years, has also come under scrutiny as part of the probe, according
to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Flynn nor his attorney, Richard Egbert, could be reached
for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman Monday acknowledged the federal investigation, saying
that the union's contracts on several past movies had been
subpoenaed. He downplayed the intensity of the investigation,
however, saying federal authorities are ``always looking at the
movie industry. This time it involves us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said he did not know the particulars of the probe, but
when asked about allegations involving Flynn, said, ``I've heard
some scuttlebutt about that, but nothing specific.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was a subject of the investigation, he said,
``Absolutely not. If I am, no one has told me.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is focusing on allegations that the Teamsters
forced producers filming around New England to hire the Location
Connection, a Boston company that provides wardrobe trailers and
other vehicles and is allegedly controlled by Flynn, according to
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the company's workers have links to organized crime in
Charlestown, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also looking into whether Flynn forced movie
producers to hire the same small group of drivers for each movie _
a group he had allegedly hand-picked, according to a source.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of disgruntled Local 25 guys who are
legitimately working and see a handful of guys in the union making
incredible amounts of money on these movie productions when they
film in Boston,'' said a source. ``It's always the same guys who
work on them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Flynn was acquitted of the 1982 gangland slaying of
Brian Halloran, a Winter Hill gang member who was gunned down on
Boston's waterfront after cooperating with the FBI against gangster
James ``Whitey'' Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Flynn, 66, has been back in the limelight as an
actor. He had cameo appearances in ``Cider House Rules'' and ``Good
Will Hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation is being led by the division of labor
and racketeering and the New England Organized Crime Strike Force,
attached to US Attorney Donald K. Stern's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our policy that we can't confirm or deny whether there is
an active investigation,'' said Dennis Kurdek, assistant special
agent in charge of the Department of Labor's Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Martin, a spokeswoman for Stern, declined to comment on
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters Local 25, which supplies the drivers for all films
shot in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine, negotiates
contracts with movie producers over wages _ a figure that can
dramatically impact production costs.
</P>
<P>
   Movie producers have long complained about the cost _ and
aggravation _ they encounter in contracting with Local 25 for
drivers on their movie productions. Under the current contract,
Teamster drivers are paid $2,000 a week for working eight hours a
day in addition to lucrative overtime and fringe benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, as one of a handful of crew chiefs, benefits from a
provision that requires he be paid for every hour that the movie
set is open, even if he is not on the set or no filming is being
done.
</P>
<P>
   One executive, who asked not to be identified, recalled that
Flynn had received weekly paychecks of about $9,000 for several of
the weeks that he had worked on the production of ``Cider House
Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole movie industry is being held hostage in Boston,
that's why they avoid it,'' said a source familiar with the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman butted heads with Warner Bros. executives during the
``Perfect Storm'' negotiations last year, prompting a producer to
fire off an angry letter to Cellucci, complaining that they were
being priced out of Massachusetts by the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   According to the letter, the executive producer complained that
the Teamsters wanted Warner Bros. to pay 72 percent more to some
union drivers than they'd been paid a year earlier when working on
``Message in a Bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Cashman said the increase in wages was justified
and was the first in many years.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci interceded with a call to Cashman and eventually the
Teamsters and Warner Bros. reached an accord, resulting in scenes
from ``The Perfect Storm'' being filmed in Gloucester.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Cellucci led a delegation that included Cashman on a
trade mission to Los Angeles in an effort to convince moviemakers
to film in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   John Birtwell, spokesman for Cellucci, said that the governor's
office was not aware of any federal investigation into the
Teamsters' union. However, he said that a few movie studio
executives had complained to Cellucci about their problems in
dealing with Local 25 but had not produced any evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time Teamsters Local 25 has been investigated
for alleged corruption involving the movie industry. In 1982, two
Local 25 members were convicted for defrauding producers of
Boston-made movies by placing no-shows and fictitious names on
their payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Victimized were producers of the following films made in Boston:
``The Brinks Job,'' produced in 1978 by Dino DeLaurentis;
``Oliver's Story,'' produced by Paramount Pictures in 1978; and
``International Velvet,'' produced by MGM in 1977.

MONADNOCK REGION VILLAGES AND COUNTRYSIDE BLOOM IN SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FITZWILLIAM, N.H. _ Nowhere else in New England can claim as
many Currier &AMP; Ives print-worthy villages as the Monadnock Region,
named for the mountain that rises dramatically from the gently
rolling countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly little has changed since the 19th century. Communities
like Fitzwilliam _ visualize white clapboard houses and steepled
meetinghouses grouped around a town green _ seem to doze much of
the year. Then high summer arrives (at last), and the landscape
suddenly gets lusher, the social scene livelier, and the
granite-ribbed countryside echoes with music.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-July, for instance, Rhododendron Maximum _ wild
rhododendron that grow up to 30 feet high _ are blooming, along
with other wildflowers, beside the paths and under the pine trees
of Rhododendron State Park in Fitzwilliam. Beautiful and profoundly
still, but for an occasional bird call, the park is a wonderful
spot for a picnic or a nature walk.
</P>
<P>
   Equally resonant of place is Monadnock Music, the acclaimed
local music festival. Each summer for 36 years the
Peterborough-based nonprofit organization Monadnock Music has
transformed the churches, meetinghouses, and town halls of regional
hamlets and small towns into concert halls. The venues are rural,
but the programs, which include infrequently performed classical
and interesting new pieces as well as standard works, are of
international-festival quality with first-rank instrumentalists and
singers from around the country and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Monadnock Music 2000, which continues through mid-September,
offers nearly three dozen programs ranging from recitals and
chamber concerts to an adaptation of Gaetano Donizetti's opera
``Don Pasquale.'' Admission ($14 to $34) is charged for only 15
events, all at the Peterborough Town House.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the series, usually chamber music performances
or recitals by individual artists, are free and held in small
communities (some with fewer than 200 residents) across the
Monadnock Region. They include such unself-consciously beautiful
and relatively untouristed places as Nelson, Washington,
Harrisville, Hancock, Francestown, Fitzwilliam, and Jaffrey Center.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years quite a few concertgoers have come for Monadnock
Music and stayed to discover the area _ and even to settle.
``People are always telling us about how they came to a concert,
fell in love with a town, and decided to buy a house there,'' says
Jocelyn Bolle, executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the churches and meetinghouses used in the series date
to Colonial days. Designed by self-taught country builders, they
are gracefully proportioned and frequently have acoustics any
big-city concert hall would envy.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the Old Meeting House in Jaffrey Center, for
example, began the day the battle of Bunker Hill was fought. It has
been the focal point of the village ever since. In a concert Aug.
27, the old church's long paneled nave (site of many a
fire-and-brimstone sermon) will amplify the artful notes of a Haydn
symphony and a Mozart string quartet.
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska-born writer Willa Cather spent many summers in the
Monadnock Region and wrote some of her best-known works in Jaffrey
Center. She is buried in the old graveyard behind the Meeting
House, beneath a headstone inscribed with a quotation from her
novel ``My Antonia,'' written in a nearby boardinghouse. ``That is
happiness,'' it reads,`` to be dissolved into something complete
and great.''
</P>
<P>
   Cather was one of the many writers, artists, and musicians who
first experienced the Monadnock Region while staying at the
MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, the oldest such creative retreat
in the country. Another MacDowell Colony writer-in-residence,
Thornton Wilder, used Peterborough as the model for the New England
small town in ``Our Town,'' one of the most frequently performed
plays in the English language.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing ``Our Town'' in the place that inspired it and where it
was written makes for a memorable theatrical experience. However,
to keep its repertoire fresh, the Peterborough Players, the area's
highly respected local summer theater company, presents the Wilder
play only once a decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this is a new decade, and ``Our Town'' will be staged
Aug. 2-20. Veteran character actor James Whitmore will appear in
the key role of ``the stage manager'' or narrator. The company is
currently showing ``The Philanderer,'' a comedy by George Bernard
Shaw. All productions are in the renovated (and air-conditioned)
barn where ``Our Town'' had its local premiere in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everywhere you go in the region you get glimpses and
views of Mount Monadnock. Benignly omnipresent, Monadnock is
visible on clear days for more than 50 miles in any direction. It
is the centerpiece of Monadnock State Park, accessible from Route
125 (Dublin Road) west of Jaffrey Center.
</P>
<P>
   Monadnock is the second-most climbed mountain in the world
(Mount Fuji in Japan is first), which says something about the
sweeping view from the 3,165-foot-high summit. More than 130,000
people made the ascent last year, many climbing a mountain for the
very first time. Children are welcome, but pets are not allowed in
the state park.
</P>
<P>
   The six trails to the summit are well-marked but steep and rocky
in places. Caution, common sense, and appropriate footwear are
essential. Still, if you've always wanted to climb a mountain and
don't mind some company, Monadnock is the peak for you.

 TAORMINA, Sicily: ... roots are.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stavolta, a credit collection man, said he tracked down his
Messina relatives through a year-long search on the Internet. He
found a cousin, Angela Stavolta, in Messina and, when he arrived in
Taormina asked Rosa to call her.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa did and found that Angela had died four years ago, but that
she had a son and daughter in Messina. Within a day, brother and
sister, Rose DeDominico, who retained her maiden name after
marriage, and her brother, Antonio DeDominico, 46 and 50, and
Rose's daughter, Josie, 24, were exchanging hugs with the
Stavoltas, with Rosa serving as interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Another reunion Rosa made possible was equally emotional. Nellie
Russo and her son Paul, both of Burlington, Nellie's sister, Sylvia
Amenta of Medford, and sister-in-law, Frannie Amenta, also of
Burlington, knew they had relatives in Canicattini Bagni, 10 miles
from Siracusa, but weren't sure who.
</P>
<P>
   On her day off, the intrepid Rosa drove the American family to
Canicattini Bagni and, outside a grocery store there, Nellie said
later, ``There was a woman who looked just like us.'' It turned out
to be a relative.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, who had lived in that very town for 15 years, knew the
locals and did all the translating. Within minutes, the
Massachusetts family was in the home where Nellie's and Sylvia's
mother, Lucia, had grown up.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa is always dedicated to her charges. She tells one story
when on a tour to Siracusa: A woman on her tour fell and broke her
arm. ``I didn't want to send her off alone in a cab,'' Rosa said,
``and I didn't want to leave the other people on the bus. So we all
went to the hospital and had a great tour there.''
</P>
<P>
   Our group provided other memorable moments.
</P>
<P>
   After it was learned that Pat Mangone, a retired postal worker
from Somerville, has a superb singing voice, he was often recruited
to entertain in the pub at the Hotel Ariston.
</P>
<P>
   When we visited the Archeological Park in Siracusa, once a
vibrant city of ancient Greece, we saw the fifth-century Greek
theater, designed by the architect Damocopos and built into the
rocky sides of the Temenite Hills, and a huge cavern called the
Orecchio di Dionisio, or the Ear of Dionysius.
</P>
<P>
   The limestone cave resembles the shape of the outer ear and has
high-fidelity acoustical qualities. Legend says that Dionysius, the
tyrant of Siracusa, used to shut his enemies in the cave and
eavesdrop on their conversations from outside.
</P>
<P>
   At our urging, Rosa led Pat into the cave and had him sing. The
organ tones of his ``Lord's Prayer'' gave us goosebumps. When I
told people in the States I was going to Sicily, many said, only
half in jest, ``Stay clear of the Mafia,'' referring to the
notoriety the Mafia has given Sicily. Our guides spoke of the
Mafia's influence in Sicily, but they didn't dwell on it.
</P>
<P>
   The only thoughts any of us gave the Mafia occurred on the day
Rosa took us on a tour to Forza d'Agro, (Strength of Agriculture),
near in miles to Taormina, but eons higher and a world apart.
</P>
<P>
   It was here, Rosa said, that Sicily scenes of ``Godfather I''
were filmed. ``This `Godfather' tour,'' Rosa tells us, ``is not
your usual tour. No shopping here, ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   On the pitched, winding road up, people on the bus started
humming the ``Godfather'' theme, but not Angelo Valastro, 29, our
driver. He was too busy navigating our Mercedes bus around hairpin
curves along a narrow two-lane road as we ascended the 1,184 feet
to Forza.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, in the thin mountain air, one is immediately struck
by its other-worldliness, a Shangri-la of cobbled streets and steps
to yet even greater heights and more spectacular views of sea and
villages below.
</P>
<P>
   The silence in Forza was almost eerie. While there, I saw only
two people, both ancient, and two cats. Forza's population of 800,
Rosa said, is ``old and dying off.'' It would be a difficult
commute for younger people who had to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   When we left Forza, we traveled on to Castelmola, three miles
from Taormina, which also has a story. Rosa brought us to the Bar
Turrisi, where we were given tastes of the almond wine made there
and the chance to buy some.
</P>
<P>
   She told us why the bar had so many fertility symbols on display
even though parents brought their children there for gelati or
granita after Sunday Mass at St. George's Church next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the 1800s,'' she said, ``Castelmola was considered a
part of Taormina but didn't want to be. Over the years, people went
to the mayor of Taormina and asked to be separated, but the mayor
told them they had to have a population of at least 1,000 to be
independent. They weren't anywhere near that, then.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept trying and, guess what? In the '60s and '70s, the
birth rate started going up and by 1974, there were 1,008
Castelmolans. That's when they became independent and when Bar
Turrisi opened.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as anyone knows, the ruling still stands and no way are
Castelmolans about to give up their independence. The fertility
symbols are there to remind them of their duty.
</P>
<P>
   Another day, we had a memorable tour to Tindari, formerly the
ancient city of Tyndaris, built by Dionysius in 396 BC, and to
Patti, a ceramics center.
</P>
<P>
   At Tindari, we climbed more steep hills after getting off the
bus, fighting sudden high winds that forced us to hold on to the
church rails or each other, to reach the Sanctuary of the Madonna
di Tindari, also known as the Black Madonna Church.
</P>
<P>
   The legend of the Black Madonna is that the statue was tarnished
in the sea where it was found by a fisherman and brought to the
sanctuary where it is said to have healing powers for people who
ask the madonna's help.
</P>
<P>
   At Patti, we were taken to the Calderone ceramic factory where
an old gent who has been a potter since boyhood showed us on his
potter's wheel how Sicily's famous ceramics are made.
</P>
<P>
   On my last night in Taormina, I went with Sicilian friends to a
colorful performance by a group of young musicians and actors,
depicting through music, words, and dance moments of Sicilian life
through history.
</P>
<P>
   They call themselves, ``Sikilia,'' the name the Arabs called
Sicily when they settled there. Recently, the group performed in
Australia and, now, would like to perform in America. ``We feel it
is very important to spread Sicilian culture,'' said Cettina
Sciacca, a teacher of English and art director for Sikilia.
</P>
<P>
   I left Sicily the next day for Malta, returning a week later to
fly home. For 15 minutes, flying from Catania north to Milan, Mount
Etna was still visible from the window of the Alitalia plane and
still belching smoke.
</P>
<P>
   As our guide Rosa Rizza would say of Etna: ``She was just doing
what she wanted when she wanted.''

BOOKING PLANS FOR SARATOGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saratoga, which opens Wednesday, offers first-class racing in a
beautiful setting, but don't act like a snob when you go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that struck me about last year's meeting was
the success of certain outfits that hadn't previously had
success,'' said Jim Mazur, coauthor of ``The Saratoga Handicapper
2000.'' ``The key to winning at Saratoga is to not downgrade some
of the shippers because they're coming from Calder or Rockingham.
Mohammed Moubarak (22-4-3-3, 18 percent winners, 45 percent in the
money, average win payoff $20.80) and Eddie Plesa Jr. (19-5-3-0, 26
percent winners, 42 percent in the money, average win payoff
$13.40) had their horses ready. From Rock, the two names that stick
out are Michael Aro and Charlie Assimakopoulos.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazur, 43, is the president of Progressive Handicapping, Inc.,
which publishes meet-specific handicapping books as well as ``The
Triple Crown Handicapper'' and ``Crushing The Cup.'' ``The Saratoga
Handicapper'' evolved from ``Saratoga Scorecard,'' written by
coauthor John Angelo, and the publications have a combined 13-year
history. With the 36-day Spa meeting, which runs through Labor Day,
on the horizon, helpful information is at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``In last year's book, we pointed out that Aro had won two
straight years with Champagneforlisa,'' Mazur said. ``Sure enough,
he came back and won with her for a third time (scored Aug. 2 at
5-2). He's 5 for 10, with an average win mutuel of $28, over the
last three seasons, and four of his winners came in the horse's
first start of the meet. He hits, and then he's gone.
Assimakopoulos is the opposite of Aro. Over the last three meets,
he's 0 for 13 the first time a horse starts, then 4 for 9 in the
second start.''
</P>
<P>
   For many fans, the highlight of the Saratoga meeting is the
2-year-old racing, and trainer D. Wayne Lukas always makes an
effort to shine in that category. He won nine juvenile races last
year and a total of 20 over the last three years. However, Mazur
points out that John Ward Jr. is also excellent with 2-year-olds,
winning with 4 of 8 first time starters over the past three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Bailey's been the dominating jockey, but from a value
perspective, take a look at Jorge Chavez,'' said Masur. ``In the
last three years, Chavez has won 80 races, with an average payoff
of $12. Bailey has won 124 races, but his average payoff is $7.
Even better, try Edgar Prado. He's just starting at Saratoga, and
he's got 38 winners for a $16 average. I'd put Robbie Albarado in
that category, too, but it looks like he's going to ride in
California. I'm not saying to bet on second-tier riders, but you
don't have to bet on the riders who get all the attention, like
Bailey.''
</P>
<P>
   For reasons unknown, front-runners did better on the turf last
year than previously, winning at a 25 percent clip on the inner
turf and a 27 percent rate on the outer. In 1993, front-runners on
the outer turf won only 15 percent of their races. Stalkers still
win 50 percent of the events over the lawn. Mazur can't explain why
this is other than to speculate the competition has gotten slightly
weaker, but the front-running trend is one to watch.
</P>
<P>
   What you definitely can avoid is an inside horse in a sprint. At
6, 6 1/2, and 7 furlongs, only eight of 138 starters, or 6 percent,
captured a race from the rail. However, closers have a tough time
as well, with only nine winners among 63 starters, or 14 percent,
at three-quarters of a mile. At 7 furlongs, post Nos. 6-10 all won
more races than Nos. 1 and 2. For route races, the bias is
pronounced to the inside. Of 216 races run at 1 1/8 miles since
1993, 20 percent have been won by No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed plays well going long,'' Mazur said. ``Front-runners or
stalkers have won 75 percent of the routes over the last three
years. Last year, 43 percent of the nine furlong winners went
wire-to-wire, while only 13 percent rallied to win. But the best
advice is to watch closely for the first few days, because you
never know. One thing for sure, the hotter it is, the more
pronounced the speed bias will be. I think the track gets packed
down, and it can reach a point where, if you're not in the first
flight, you have no chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping at Saratoga can also be enhanced by the Internet,
and for the first time, Mazur will offer The Daily Sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it takes time for our subscribers to look things up
and write them down,'' he said. ``Now we have The Daily Sheet,
about 10 pages of percentage highs and lows, key races, and horses
to watch, by John Angelo, who attends every day of the meeting,
that can be downloaded and printed out. We leave you no room to
forget. People are short on time these days, and now you don't have
to look things up yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We debuted this at Gulfstream last spring, are currently doing
it at Monmouth and Belmont, and will do it at Saratoga and Del Mar
this summer. It's been very popular. Streaks can develop at
Saratoga in two or three days, and even though we update the book
twice during the meet, the sheet will keep you informed
day-to-day.''
</P>
<P>
   More information on ``The Saratoga Handicapper 2000'' and The
Daily Sheet is available at 800-272-8039.

   Joe Hartmann, general manager of Plainridge Racecourse, is
moving to Florida, but he will stay involved with the harness track
in Plainville, Mass., as a consultant. Hartmann, 50, who also
worked at Foxboro Stadium, has been instrumental in establishing
Plainridge, now in its second year, through simulcasting,
marketing, and public relations . . . These are tough times for Bob
Baffert. Nautical Look, a 3-year-old trained by Baffert, tested
positive for morphine after winning the seventh race at Hollywood
May 3. Truesdail Laboratories reported the finding, which was
confirmed by a Texas lab. The California Horse Racing Board has
issued a complaint against Baffert, and the stewards at Del Mar,
which opens Wednesday, will schedule a hearing. George Hofmeister,
who purchased 1998 Kentucky Derby winner Real Quiet for $1.1
million, has sued Baffert, claiming Real Quiet ``has been unable to
race due to severe injuries to both front legs.'' Baffert called
the suit ``frivolous.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ Curl your lower lip under the top row of teeth,
then flip the lip out. It sometimes comes out sounding like some
juiced-up cow town with attitude:
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Philly.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   It is home to a deep, rich brew of Americans, from all nations
and backgrounds. It owns a huge chunk of the nation's history. It
has a police department with a rollicking history of its own, plus
visionaries, muckrackers, prophets, poets, and more Democrats than
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of politicians and a media horde of thousands more
prepare to arrive next week for the GOP national convention, this
old, soulful, and often insecure city sits and waits by the banks
of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, both low and easy in the
summer heat now.
</P>
<P>
   Like most big cities, it has its own balm, its own curse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let North Philly go,'' says Phillip Poindexter, a
firefighter. ``You see a lot of homeless people walking. Everywhere
you go, people asking for money. It's heartbreaking. Drugs are
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Waller, a 47-year-old lawyer _ who once did
anti-corruption work in Boston _ just loves this town. For him,
it's the opera and orchestra and the jazzy downtown of Center City.
</P>
<P>
   To him, it's a city survived, a city rising up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly,'' says Waller, ``I think we're a dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans arrive next Monday for four days. It'll be the
beginning of the midsummer blitz of political conventioneering.
Their challenge, as always, will be to connect with small and
mid-town America, hoping the words and actions and imagery float
out into the countryside, up and over farmhouses from this place,
this backdrop. Souls must be touched. Every vote counts.
</P>
<P>
   But what of Philadelphia, the host city? Who are the people here
_ mere background extras in a gigantic upcoming movie, to be
drowned out by machinery of national politics and the unblinking,
unforgiving eye of TV? After all, as lawyer Waller allows, the
conventioneers will be moving in their own unreal zone, ``from
air-conditioned place to air-conditioned place.''
</P>
<P>
   Extras? Hardly. These are workaday Americans, toilers, intent to
keep on working and breathing and holding on long after the last
echoes of footsteps from the arriving army have disappeared like
waves on the Schuylkill river.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the cacophony that is urban America, sometimes a city can
seem a sad and tricky place, its denizens made to feel puny.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Poindexter used to feel that way. The firefighter swears
he's supposed to be dead, a dope fiend's end, just some bones over
in a Germantown cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he walks through fires, saving lives.
</P>
<P>
   So sometimes a city can seem a blessed place to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the grace of God I'm here,'' Poindexter is saying. ``The
way I came up, I fell through the cracks. I'm not even supposed to
be here. I came up around a lot of drugs, alcoholism. We didn't
have money. I don't have a college degree. So, for me to have a
good job like this, it's by the grace of God and determination. I
couldn't ask for no better.''
</P>
<P>
   He's wearing a gold cross on his chest, standing in front of his
fire station on Broad Street.
</P>
<P>
   When he got his release papers from the Army, he knew he wanted
to come home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I been half-way around the world. My heart and soul is here in
Philly.''
</P>
<P>
   He's 43 years old. He and his wife are raising three daughters.
Sometimes he'll look at his daughters and get choked up with joy
the way they're growing, and learning. He'll feel fine as a city
dweller can feel. And yet, he can get bluesy about the drugs, the
crime. ``The people trapped in that drug culture. It's a lot of
good people who want to get out, but are trapped. People trying to
live good down there are being held in bondage,'' he says about the
area here known as the Badlands.
</P>
<P>
   So the curse seems fixed, nailed down, part of the grain of
big-city life. But here's some balm, from a man who walks through
fire: ``I'm not supposed to be making $40,000 a year. It's great
with benefits. I couldn't ask for no better.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphians say they have a lot of other reasons to feel that
way _ that they couldn't really ask for better.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Museum of Art can hold its own with any museum
in the country. No one sneezes at the Philadelphia Orchestra, or
the Lyric Opera company. Both are esteemed. There's a library here
called the Library Company. Its founder: Ben Franklin himself. The
institutions of higher learning _ Temple University, the University
of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, to name just three _ attract
the topflight.

   There are myriad reasons to strut a bit. Here's one: the ballad
of Marian Anderson, a onetime South Philadelphia High School
student. She was a little Negro girl with a glorious singing voice
even as a child. She became a leading contralto, traveled the
world. In 1939 she was denied an opportunity to play Constitution
Hall in the nation's capital; it was largely understood that the
Daughters of the American Revolution orchestrated the snub. The
Roosevelt administration arranged for Anderson to sing at the
Lincoln Memorial that year. She sang before 75,000. Old men and
women got choked up. Little Marian Anderson's voice flew like
birds. And there she was, a symbol, a civil right unto herself, a
native of the city where the Declaration of Independence was
signed, where the Liberty Bell cracked tolling the death of Chief
Justice John Marshall in 1835.
</P>
<P>
   You can chart the city's recent decades and witness rise and
fall and rise again.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s Philadelphia seemed to be one big bopping Afro,
leaning heavily into rhythm and blues. Two songwriters, Kenny
Gamble and Leon Huff, wrote hit after hit. Their sound _
popularized by a group known as Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes
featuring Teddy Pendergrass _ was known as TSOP (The Sounds of
Philadelphia). Harold's dead. Teddy is in a wheelchair from a car
accident. But Gamble has an office right here on Broad Street. The
soul music lives on.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Rizzo served as mayor from 1972 through 1980. The city had
never seen anything like him. He called his police officers ``my
army,'' and many minority citizens and gays felt targeted for harsh
treatment. There were lawsuits and charges of police brutality _ an
ugly legacy that seemed echoed again this month as city police were
videotaped beating and kicking a suspect. Some thought Rizzo a
caricature with a permanent law-and-order scowl; others saluted him
as a champion of blue collar urban angst.
</P>
<P>
   It's a famous photo, as startling in its way as the dogs and
children in Birmingham: Frank Rizzo was once seen in a tuxedo, a
nightstick poking from his cummerbund.
</P>
<P>
   The 1980s were downright scary. Philadelphia nearly went broke.
There were nasty union battles, a frighteningly low bond rating.
There were more police brutality lawsuits, memories played out
across the nation in the aftermath of the recent police shootout
and beating of a suspect who had stolen a police car and shot at
officers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 _ the city by then had its first black mayor _ the
police department, during a standoff, attacked a group of blacks
over on Osage avenue, dropping a bomb. Eleven died. Four of them
children. The nation recoiled.
</P>
<P>
   The 90s saw a renaissance, a populist city and a populist mayor
by the name of Ed Rendell. Buzz Bissinger, a onetime Philadelphia
journalist, wrote a book about the city's survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Prayer for the City,'' it was gently titled.

AVICI SYSTEMS MOVES THE PIECES INTO POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's seven feet tall, weighs 1,200 pounds, and appears to make
investors salivate?
</P>
<P>
   It is the high-speed telecommunications gear manufactured by
Avici Systems Inc., a young company scheduled to go public this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Underwriters jacked up the size of the Avici IPO by 75 percent
Monday, adding another million shares for sale and increasing the
price range from the original $18 to $20 per share to $28 to $30.
Now the offering is expected to raise about $210 million and give
Avici an initial stock market value of about $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a sign they have solid institutional demand lined up,''
said Jeff Hirschkorn, a senior market analyst at IPO.com. Avici
``has a product that's in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschkorn expects the stock to be hot when it begins trading,
scheduled for Friday. So does George Nichols, an IPO analyst at
Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company has generated a lot of buzz,'' said Nichols.
``It's probably going to be a scorcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, considering Avici, of Billerica, Mass., is hitting the
market in what appears to be the biggest IPO week of the year so
far, as underwriters push out a huge number of shares in front of
the usual August lull.
</P>
<P>
   Avici certainly is selling the kind of hardware the
telecom-enamored stock market likes to see, giant terabit switch
routers that can help direct massive amounts of network traffic for
Internet service providers and other potential customers. Never
mind that customers may need to reinforce floors supporting the
machines that stand nearly as tall as Shaquille O'Neal and can
weigh about four times as much.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware companies such as Avici sell components that can turn
the vast potential of fiber-optic networks into reality, connecting
and switching huge amounts of data so it gets to where it is
supposed to go at the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are flocking to the stocks of those companies because
demand for their products is already impressive and expected to
grow enormously for years to come. Avici is likely to benefit from
that trend, at least in its early days as a public stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a position in the sun because they stuck it out,
persevered, and went after a big hairy market, which they're in
now,'' said Todd Dagres, general partner at Batterymarch Ventures,
a venture capital firm in Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the stock market likes high-end, high-performance
carrier equipment, particularly if it plugs into optical networks,
and that's where they're positioned,'' he said. ``The only question
I have is: do they really have the advanced technology?''
</P>
<P>
   Avici must wrestle with the same hurdles that small
communications gear companies face: tough competitors,
fast-changing technology, and a limited operating history with just
a few customers.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: Avici and its giant boxes face towering
competition from established companies such as Cisco Systems Inc.
and Juniper Networks. Even if it has an edge, will the company have
what it takes to stay ahead?
</P>
<P>
   The good news: Juniper Networks proved an upstart can muscle its
way into a rapidly evolving market. Juniper, the newcomer when it
went public last summer, has seen its shares soar astonishingly by
a factor of 21 since its IPO in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Several competitors on Avici's scale have been bought since by
giant companies, most notably the $900 million acquisition of
Nexabit Networks Inc. of Marlborough, Mass. by Lucent Technologies
Inc. last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Avici, which began marketing its products last fall, has
generated about $126 million in losses so far. Revenue in the
second quarter was estimated at $2.2 million, according to the
company's most recent public documents.
</P>
<P>
   Avici has been funded by three California venture-capital firms
and Nortel Networks Corp. Nortel had been seen as a possible
acquirer of the young company, but it severed its relationship with
Avici last summer at just about the same time Juniper went public
and Nexabit was sold to Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   Now Avici has tentative deals with Williams Communications and
Enron Broadband Services for the sale of $45 million worth of
equipment this year. The sales are subject to field trials now
being conducted by the customers. Avici's terabit switch router has
been lab-tested by AT&AMP;T Corp. and selected for field trials later
this year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other telecom gear companies, there's no denying the
potential at Avici. But can all these companies be the big winners
their stock prices suggest, even with the huge anticipated demand
for their hardware?
</P>
<P>
   The sobering truth: it's hard to tell the best from the rest at
this stage and there's already a lot of money on the table.

 HIGH-TECH LAND MINE TRIGGERS WAR OF WORDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Textron Systems stands to win hundreds of millions of dollars in
Army orders for a new high-tech land mine meant to enable the
United States to meet the criteria of an international treaty
restricting the use of mines.
</P>
<P>
   The ``man-in-the-loop'' technology being developed by a Textron
unit in Wilmington, Mass., in theory, would reduce the risks from
mines to civilians and friendly troops by using sensors to detect
enemy troops and alert soldiers who could detonate the mines
remotely.
</P>
<P>
   But the business, which would bolster Textron's defense
revenues, may be jeopardized by a dispute emerging over triggering
software that would give Army commanders the option of overriding
the ``man-in-the-loop'' on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration hopes to deploy the new mines in the
next few years as part of an effort to bring the nation into
compliance with the 1997 Ottawa Convention. Critics, however, say
the software being studied by the Pentagon would violate that
antipersonnel mine treaty by enabling the new mines to explode
nearly as indiscriminately as those in the Army's current arsenal.
One influential US senator, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, is
threatening to oppose funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's contracts carry the potential for as much as $500
million in orders for Textron Systems and a partner, Alliant
Integrated Defense Co. of Minneapolis. The orders are important to
parent Textron Inc. of Providence, R.I., as it seeks to diversify
its business base in the aftermath of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Textron's defense work peaked at around 25 percent of total
revenue in 1990. But that figure has declined in recent years under
chief executive Lewis Campbell, who has focused on the
manufacturing company's commercial lines ranging from automotive
parts to civilian helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Sales to the US government, primarily military goods, accounted
for $1.3 billion, just over 10 percent of Textron's revenue of
$11.6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The military's high-tech mine program was a direct response to
criticism of the US refusal to sign the Ottawa treaty. The treaty
prohibits antipersonnel mines ``designed to be exploded by the
presence, proximity or contact of a person and that will
incapacitate, injure or kill one or more persons.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States held back from signing, citing a need for
mines in areas such as South Korea's northern border. But the
Clinton adminstration said in 1998 that the United States should be
ready to sign by 2006 if substitute measures are developed.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy centers on a setting that could be added to the
mine known as ``battlefield override.'' In this mode, the mines
would detonate whenever an approaching person tripped either a wire
or an electronic sensor.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy, a longtime critic of land mine deployment, calls the
technology ``very troubling'' and says it would violate the Ottawa
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 10 letter to Undersecretary of Defense Walter Slocombe,
Leahy wrote that ``it is clear to me that the (override) feature is
being included because some field commanders have never accepted
the administration's 1997 policy to accede to the Ottawa
Convention.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman, Marine Lieutenant Colonel Dave Lapan, said
officials still are weighing whether to include the override. He
said the Pentagon hasn't yet begun a legal review of whether an
override would, in fact, violate the Ottawa treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still too premature to discuss specifics such as the
battlefield override feature,'' Lapan wrote in a recent e-mail.
``Our efforts are still in the exploratory stage, seeking to
address both humanitarian concerns and the needs of the
warfighter.''
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier letter to Leahy, Slocombe also wrote that by
studying the feature, the military might gain
``as-of-yet-unforeseen insights'' in mine development.
</P>
<P>
   The broad debate matters for the contractors because Leahy, a
member of the Senate's Defense Appropriations subcommittee, is
threatening to oppose funding to develop the weapon unless the Army
drops the software enabling the override setting.
</P>
<P>
   Other experimental designs might distinguish between tanks and
civilian vehicles automatically, or attach microelectronic homing
beacons to enemy troops or vehicles that could be used to target
shells fired from conventional guns or mortars.
</P>
<P>
   But Textron's design is the most advanced and is scheduled to
enter service by 2003. As a result, mine opponents have seized on
the override feature to press the administration on its stance on
the treaty as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Even consideration of the override ``certainly makes you
quesiton the commitment of the US government to joining the land
mine treaty,'' said policy analyst Rachel Stohl of the Center for
Defense Information, a liberal think tank in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   With an override, ``This weapon will be an indiscriminate
killer, unable to tell a soldier from a civilian,'' Stephen Goose
of the Human Rights Watch lobbying group, said in a statement.
``The Pentagon's alternative to land mines is no alternative at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Textron Systems senior vice president Frank Tempesta said the
company could develop the new mine either with or without the
override setting, which would be created with the addition of a few
lines of software code to the command modules soldiers would used
to control the mines.
</P>
<P>
   Textron and Alliant were issued contracts last month to begin
joint-development work on the new mines.
</P>
<P>
   Land mines have been used by the United States and NATO forces
for decades, particularly along borders where allied troops have
been outnumbered, such as the border between North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the Cold War, though, mine use has come under
criticism for the damages mines cause in developing nations. The
State Department estimates there are between 60 to 70 million mines
buried worldwide, maiming and killing thousands of civilians each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy has been concerned about mines since the late 1980s, when
he started a fund to aid victims. In 1991, groups such as Human
Rights Watch and the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation began
calling for the abolition of the weapon. Retired General Norman
Schwartzkopf and other figures eventually endorsed the movement
that became known as the International Campaign to Ban Landmines,
and one of its architects, Jody Williams of Putney, Vt., won a
Nobel Peace Prize for her work in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, 100 countries signed the Ottawa Convention
banning most antipersonnel mines, though not antitank devices or
certain other categories of mines. Signatories now include most
NATO members, such as Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Russia and China are still holdouts. Two
years ago, President Clinton said the United States would sign by
2006 ``if we succeed in identifying and fielding suitable
alternatives'' to existing mines by then.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Textron Systems, which employs 1,200 people in and around
Wilmington making remote sensors and complex military gear such as
microwave transmitters to help land big transport planes on remote
airstrips. It also sells the Army an antitank mine known as the
Hornet Wide Area Munition.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Textron and Alliant were chosen from 52 companies
competing to build weapons for what the Army calls its
``Anti-Personnel Landmine Alternatives'' program.
</P>
<P>
   The Army hopes to replace some of its existing mines based on
World War II models, which blast steel fragments in a deadly circle
60 feet across. Officers at the Army's Picatinny Arsenal in New
Jersey said Textron's prototypes connected new electronics to the
Army's existing M16 mine, which includes up to four pounds of
explosive in a coffee can-sized container.
</P>
<P>
   The Army envisions a new weapon that would pack explosives into
tubes pointed in six directions, each of which could be fired
remotely, said Pentagon spokesman Lapan. The weapon also might
include nonlethal capabilities such as nets or tear gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some military analysts say the override setting is needed to
make the mine effective, and that Clinton's 1998 pledge to try to
comply with Ottawa via technology was never realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man-in-the-loop would require that some poor fool stay at the
controls while the rest of the unit bugs out under an assault, and
that's not a great way to run things,'' said Dan Goure, of the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The
center's president, John Hamre, recently stepped down as deputy
defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Goure compared the ``battlefield override'' setting to one that
already exists on the Navy's Phalanx antimissile guns, which are
aimed by radar and can be set to fire at any moving target that
appears over the horizon in combat. ``There are rules of engagement
for that weapon, and land mines would be similar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army first described the override feature about six months
ago at a conference held by the National Academy of Sciences, but
only as a hypothetical possibility, said Lapan. The Army's actual
study of the override switch was publicized by Caleb Rossiter, a
policy consultant to the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation,
which has close ties to the military and to Leahy's office.
</P>
<P>
   Rossiter says he supports an upgraded mine for the Army, and
that the override feature could be useful during a firefight. But
preparing the United States to sign and comply with the Ottawa
treaty is more important, he said. ``Our argument has been, of
course there's some military utility to these land mines,'' he
said. ``But the humanitarian cost far outweighs that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossiter said he is disappointed because the new mine
technologies previously have been advertised as in keeping with the
Ottawa treaty.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in a press release last month after it received
the Army contract, Textron's partner Alliant quoted its president,
Hubert D. Hopkins, as saying that the the man-in-the-loop design
``leaves no risk to friendly troops or noncombatants following a
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   An Alliant spokeswoman said the statement is still ``consistent
with what we believe the intent of the (new mine) program will
be.'' But with the final design unclear, she said, the company
might revise its statements in the future.

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANALOG AND DIGITAL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What is the difference between the much used terminology of
``analog'' and ``digital'' as used in electronic equipment? K.B.,
North Attleborough, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Analog quantities are quantities that, at least in principle,
can take on any value within some range. For example, the
temperature outside might take on any value between 0 and 100 today
_ perhaps it will be 86.45321 degrees. They correspond to the
numbers you use to measure things and can, in principle, have an
infinite number of decimal places.
</P>
<P>
   Digital quantities can only take on a set of discrete values,
like the number of eggs you have in the refrigerator _ a 10th of an
egg would make no sense. They correspond to the numbers you use to
count things and always have a finite number of digits.
</P>
<P>
   Where it applies to electronic equipment, such as recording
devices, analog's advantage is that the entire sound is recorded in
a continuous wave and sent to the speakers, rather than the digital
method that essentially records pieces of sound and then links them
together.
</P>
<P>
   But this is also analog's drawback because, in the case of music
recording, background noise, distortion, interference, even the
sound of the recording equipment itself can be picked up and
recreated in the final product and there's nothing you can do about
it.
</P>
<P>
   It's also easy to make mistakes in sending, storing, and
processing analog information since it's often hard to tell whether
the last few decimal places were really what they were originally,
or if they corresponded to some unavoidable distortions that got
picked up along the way: In principle, you need an infinite number
of decimal places and while you might be able to send an infinite
amount of information in one analog number, the odds are that most
will get lost in all the little confusions that are bound to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Digital information is much more robust. Suppose you want to
send the number ``27,'' and what is received is ``27.0213.'' You
might guess then that the .0213 is due to some error, and that the
real message was ``27,'' and you would very likely be correct. If
you really wanted to send 27.0213, you might send 270213 and 4 to
remind you to put a decimal point four places in from the right.
</P>
<P>
   In music recording, then, all extraneous sound is stripped from
the signal and you're left with an exact electronic interpretation,
or picture, of only the music that was being created. This makes
digitally recorded music perhaps sound cleaner and brighter, but
purists would counter that it is only a computerized picture of the
sound, not the complete sound itself.
</P>
<P>
   Any analog information can always be approximated digitally,
and, although it means losing decimal places, you can always take
as many as you want and write the rest of them off as being no
bigger than the unavoidable noise. This is useful for turning old
scratchy Billie Holiday recordings into better-sounding digital
masters. You can try to keep some of the nonmusical essence that
makes the performance special while you discard annoying scratches
or other interference.
</P>
<P>
   It is for this reason that most music now is stored digitally.
Similarly, for computer calculations, it's convenient to represent
numbers, even if they might come close to representing a continuous
quantity, by a set of single digits _ usually in what is called
``binary,'' so that you only use ones and zeroes.

   SEATTLE _ As peaks in the Olympic Range go, Green Mountain isn't
impressive. But, at 2,400 feet, it certainly is high enough _ and
wide enough _ to be a dangerous obstacle for airplanes. Watching it
grow larger by the second in the windscreen of Honeywell's
experimental Beechcraft King Air during a flight last month, the
mountain looked particularly ominous.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the flight was not to collide with Green Mountain
but to demonstrate technology's answer to what pilots call
``controlled flight into terrain.'' The innocuous-sounding phrase,
known in aviation circles by its abbreviation CFIT (cee-fit),
refers to mechanically sound airplanes flown by skilled pilots who
maintained perfect control over the airplanes as they flew into the
ground or mountainside.
</P>
<P>
   CFIT is the leading cause of death in airplane accidents, with
more than 2,000 fatalities worldwide since 1990. In 1995, an
American Airlines flight slammed into a mountain in Cali, Colombia,
killing 160 people, when a pilot unfamiliar with the area became
confused and didn't realize a mountain loomed ahead. Two years
later, a Korean Air Boeing 747 crashed into a hill 3 miles from a
Guam runway, killing 228.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that, until recently, pilots haven't had
instruments that can ``see'' obstacles in front of them _ even if
they are as big as a mountain. As a result, if the pilot doesn't
notice the obstacle, the instruments won't warn him, either.
</P>
<P>
   But, thanks to the same global positioning system technology
that can tell hikers and drivers where they are at all times, that
is changing. The Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System, which
lists at about $68,000 per plane, is a computer that uses a
database of the world's topography, combined with GPS technology
and a complex formula for the plane's position and movements to
warn pilots of obstacles in the flight path.
</P>
<P>
   The display screen is adjustable to look ahead from 10 to 345
nautical miles, shows safe flight paths in green, marking places
where all obstacles are at least 500 feet below the plane. Yellow
lights mark terrain features that are less than 500 feet below the
plane or up to 1,000 feet above it. Even higher obstacles, which
would require dramatic maneuvers to avoid, are marked in red. A
voice amplifies the warning as the plane closes in on the yellow or
red zones.
</P>
<P>
   In the test plane, yellow and red were dominating the screen in
the path of the airplane as it approached Green Mountain, and pilot
Markus Johnson had ignored the initial alerts of ``Caution,
terrain!'' that came from the system when he was still a minute
away from hitting the mountain. At 30 seconds, the electronic voice
became more urgent, saying ``Terrain! Pull up! Pull up!''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, eager to alarm four journalists attending a recent
safety conference, not only continued flying toward the mountain,
the altimeter was actually winding down as the plane descended. It
was a matter of who would blink first and it wasn't close. When a
radio reporter broke and said, ``OK, you can pull up now,'' Johnson
banked and climbed away from the peak, the G forces pinning the
occupants in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Ground-proximity warning systems have been around for more than
30 years, but they could only look straight down because they were
based on radar altimeter technology that throws radio waves off the
Earth's surface and calculates distance by the speed that they
return.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, pilots only learned of an approaching obstacle by
changes in the distance to the ground below. If the mountain was
steep-sided, such warnings would leave very little time to react.
In addition, the original ground warning systems had to be
suppressed when landing gear was down and the flaps were extended
because it meant the plane was landing.
</P>
<P>
   But the new enhanced version _ Honeywell is the prime
manufacturer _ runs on far less limiting technology. GPS, which
uses satellites orbiting the planet to determine precise locations
of anyone with a GPS transmitter, determines where the plane is.
Then, the highly detailed computer database of the world's terrain
gives the pilot a precise map of all terrain features around him _
including the exact position of runways.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the computer employs a ``look-ahead
algorithm'' based on the plane's movement to determine which
obstacles pose the most immediate threat. That algorithm, or
formula, takes into account the aircraft's position, flight path
angle, turn rate or roll, and relative speed to give the pilot up
to several minutes of advance warning.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson demonstated the system after the close encounter with
the mountain. Flying out over Dabob Bay, Johnson brought the plane
down from 3,000 to 1,000 feet, as if he were beginning a final
approach to land. The only indication that something was amiss was
the radar screen painting what had been blue terrain (for water)
into yellow (for potentially hazardous land).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson put down the landing gear, and even turned on the
landing lights for effect. ``My flaps are set, the rate of descent
is fine,'' he said, running through a mental checklist. ``I'm
coming in to land and everything would be telling the older system
that we were making one hell of an approach.'' The only problem:
The plane was miles from any runway.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, when the altimeter read 700 feet, the electronic voice
blurted out: ``Terrain, terrain! Pull up! Pull up!''
</P>
<P>
   The database also contains more than 20,000 manmade obstacles,
like radio and television towers, in North America. And it will
alert the pilot when a turn or dive is extreme. When the airplane
took off from Boeing Field, traffic was flying overhead on final
approach to Seattle Tacoma International Airport, so Johnson was
forced to make a sharp right turn under the jets. Commercial
airplanes normally bank at no more than 30 degrees. The alerting
system on board the airplane was set to go off when the bank
reached 52 degrees, and when Johnson made the turn, the mechanical
voice let it be known to all on board he exceeded 52 degrees,
because it warned ``Bank rate!''
</P>
<P>
   Such a pointed warning system might have saved the passengers
and crew on Korean Air Flight 801, which crashed into a 650-foot
hillside in Guam in 1997, killing all but 26 on aboard.
Investigators found that the pilots flew an approach as if all
navigation aids used in instrument landings were working, but they
were not. As a result, the plane hit a small hill that was obscured
in a rain storm.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 5,000 commercial jetliners are equipped with
enhanced ground warning systems, about one-third of the worldwide
fleet. It is standard equipment on all new aircraft. Honeywell
officials say that there have been at least 15 incidents when the
system helped avert tragedy, including a 777 that was attempting to
land in Rio de Janiero, but was coming in too low when the system
alerted the flight crew.
</P>
<P>
   A $30,000 version is available for small- and medium-sized
business jets and Honeywell is awaiting certification of a $10,000
general aviation model.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots say its widespread use cannot occur soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that (the new warning system) is the single biggest
safety advance since the installation of the jet engine,'' said
Capt. Robert L. Sumwalt III, chairman of the Air Line Pilots
Association human factors and ergonomics committee.
</P>
<P>
   The system is being used by several airlines in conjunction with
other equipment to not only improve the margins of safety, but also
lower costs by saving fuel and increase schedule reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines, which flies over some of the roughest terrain
in the world, uses enhanced ground proximity tied into its flight
management computer and a display system that allows the pilot to
keep his or her head up and view the system at the same time. The
$200,000 glass screen, which displays flight instruments, is
focused at infinity so the pilot can look out the windscreen
through the display, and still see readouts on speed, altitude and
other functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are looking in and out, up and down, while trying to
land at 150 nautical miles (per hour), it is a huge work-load
task,'' said Alaska Airlines pilot Mike Adams.

<P>
   The display makes landings easier as well, because it has
vertical and horizontal guidance for runways.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system is particularly valuable for approaching Alaskan
airports, such as Juneau International, where planes must fly along
a channel between mountains, and then make a turn onto the runway
heading. The ground warning system and flight-management computers
help make sure the plane stays on its narrowly defined course by
monitoring specific checkpoints _ called waypoints _ that the plane
must pass at certain speeds and altitudes to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   At many airport in Alaska and elsewhere, the ground-based
navigation aids provide direction only to the runway centerline.
This lateral guidance does not give pilots vertical guidance, which
allows for a steady rate of descent. Because of that, pilots have
to use a so-called step-down approach, much like someone going down
stairs, rather than a steady descent like going down a slide.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation specialists such as Boeing Co.'s Bob Myers, the program
manager for safety technology development, say a constant descent
versus a nonprecision, or step-down approach, increases safety by a
factor or four to eight times.
</P>
<P>
   But Alaska Air's guidance system and the waypoints are so
precise that, even at the most challenging airports, pilots can
descend on a steady slope rather than using the step-down approach.
At Sitka Airport, for example, pilots now descend smoothly rather
than follow the nine steps down that they previously needed.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways is using a similar system on its Airbus aircraft to
eliminate all nonprecision approaches at every runway of every
airport where the airline's Airbus aircraft flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a major corporate commitment to eliminate nonprecision
approaches,'' said US Airways A330 chief pilot Tracy Barnett. ``We
wanted vertical and lateral guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is a continuous debate on how much processed data to
give to flight crews _ because, as Boeing's Myers said, ``One man's
information is another man's clutter'' _ work is progressing on
developing a three-dimensional display of the world outside the
airplane. Such synthetic vision would give pilots a clear
electronic picture of what is outside the airplane, no matter what
the weather.
</P>
<P>
   NASA already has tested successfully a version of the system
using a database around Asheville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Global Position System signals, pilots can know exactly
where they are,'' said Michael Lewis, director of NASA's Aviation
Safety Program. ``Add super-accurate terrain databases and
graphical displays and we can now draw three-dimensional moving
scenes that will show pilots exactly what is outside. The type of
accidents that can happen in poor visibility just don't happen when
pilots can see the terrain hazards outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said both the computing power and the maps are available
now to create fairly reliable three-dimensional pictures. For
instance, the Radar Topography Mission of the Space Shuttle took
three dimensional measurements of 80 percent of the Earth's terrain
and is accurate to about 55 feet. But he said the data needs to be
updated and verified for accuracy before pilots can rely on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting synthetic vision certified for operation is the big
hurdle,'' Lewis said. ``It takes it from being an R&AMP;D trick to . .
. being always available.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, once the engineering is complete, every flight
will look like clear, daytime weather to the pilots, which will
translate into safer air travel for passengers.

GLOBAL VICTIMS OF TORTURE FIND A REFUGE IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes torture victims text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEGAN SCOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To this day, men in uniforms make Carlos nervous and
fidgety. After all, it was a soldier _ a childhood friend, no less
_ who shot him in the back and left him for dead in his native
Guatemala in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Carlos (not his real name) had been an ordinary
peasant, struggling to survive amid a long civil war. But, when he
began organizing indigenous people in Guatemala _ teaching them
Spanish, the language of government _ he became a target.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Carlos hid from the soldiers, but they found him
when he returned to his town to visit his parents. The bullet
ruptured his spine, and, as he lay bleeding and paralyzed at his
own home, Carlos came within a heartbeat of becoming another of the
200,000 people who died in the 36-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But now Carlos has a job and a home in the Boston area, as well
as the safety of political asylum and doctors who help him cope
with the painful aftershocks of political persecution and violence.
Carlos was one of 90 patients from more than 25 countries who got
help at the Center for Refugee Health and Human Rights at Boston
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are places where people can get assistance for their
difficulties,'' said Michael Grodin, director of Human Rights
Advocacy and Education for the center, one of only a handful of
places in the United States to provide physical, mental, legal and
social services to refugees and survivors of torture. ``We're able
to really assess the needs of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pervasive use of torture as a political weapon from
Kosovo to Cambodia, there is a hidden prohibition against talking
about its victims, said Douglas A. Johnson, executive director of
the Center for Victims of Torture in Minneapolis, one of the oldest
such centers. While there are more than 400,000 survivors living in
the United States, the survivors' pain and suffering remain hidden
and unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Torture is such a frightening word,'' Johnson said. ``Not
enough people are taking the time to think about it. It's a topic
that's full of despair and fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel,
Inhumane and Degrading Treatment or Punishment defines survivors of
torture as those who have suffered from severe physical or mental
pain, intentionally inflicted by a public official or a person
acting in an official capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of torture is to destroy the individual that is being
targeted,'' Johnson said. ``Torture is not really about getting
information. They're trying to prove to the torture victim that
they're worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   According to 1999 Amnesty International figures, torture and ill
treatment were practiced in 125 countries, including Africa, Asia
and Southeast Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. More than
100 governments engage in the practice against leaders who are
active in the defense of human rights, political opposition
leaders, trade unionists, religious figures, human rights advocates
and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Torture is a kind of lesson where repressive regimes are
teaching their communities to stay out of politics, to be apathetic
and disengage in public life,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Torturers destroy leaders, rendering them helpless and
dependent, and in turn send a message of fear throughout the
community. More than two-thirds of torture victims have at least
some college education, according to the Center for Victims of
Torture, and a similar proportion hold professional or political
jobs or they are students. The point of torture is to silence
voices, removing people's right to speak and their rights as human
beings.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors endure the trauma of physical, mental and sexual
torture. They are stabbed with needles; hung by their wrists,
ankles and genitals; burned, shocked and flogged with belts and
ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Greater pyschological damage is inflicted with sham executions,
sexual torture, disappearance of loved ones, threats against family
members, and imprisonment with sensory deprivation.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional scars extend beyond the individual, affecting
their families, the community and society. But with the combined
efforts of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, physicians, physical
therapists and volunteers, survivors learn how to sleep through the
night without nightmares, engage with people and diminish the pain
and depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to use an interdisciplinary approach to these
patients,'' said Grodin, a professor of health law, sociomedical
science and psychiatry at Boston University. ``All these people
suffer from trauma. The hallmark is to try to get them to work. If
they work, they can support themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors come with their own stories, carrying the physical and
emotional scars from their country of origin. Most have
post-traumatic stress disorder. They also can be at risk for
anxiety disorders, substance abuse, somatic symptoms and psychosis.
Somatic symptoms are mental trauma manifested through physical
signs of symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't always make that connection between what they've
been exposed to and what they're experiencing,'' said Linda
Piwowarczyk, instructor of psychiatry for the International Mental
Health Program. ``Sometimes people don't make a connection between
their symptoms and experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Victims of Torture struggles with funding,
receiving no money from the federal government. Instead, it relies
solely on donations from the community, devoting more than 85
percent of all operating revenue to programs that directly benefit
torture survivors. A speakers bureau assists their fund-raising
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to dedicate time in going out and doing public
education and getting people involved in it,'' Johnson said. ``It's
about trying to get people to understand how important this is.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, torture survivors were making contributions in
their respective communities and they long to do it again. Although
most continue to receive lifelong care at the centers, they go on
to start their own businesses. Some who practiced medicine in their
countries become doctors in the United States. A tiny percentage
return home if it's not too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is full of hope,'' Johnson said. ``That's what excites
people here. That's what gets people out of bed in the morning.
This is a place that's full of hope. Our work is restoring the
dignity of the human spirit. That's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos, at the Boston center, was rescued by a friend who took
him to a hospital after he had been shot. In 1990, he escaped
across Guatemala's border with Mexico and went on to Canada _ but
he couldn't stay away from his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the war ended and he returned to Guatemala with the
hope of finding his parents. But despite the peace agreement,
Carlos was nearly hit by a hand grenade and he was detained in a
psychiatric ward of a hospital for 10 days. Once again, this time
perhaps forever, he fled Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Carlos works on an assembly line. He lives in a shelter
and is working to obtain his driver's license. He also is learning
English. Ten years have passed since he last saw his parents. His
mother, who had moved to Mexico, died in March.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston center helped him get a new wheelchair, obtain
political asylum status and has provided him with ongoing,
continuous support. He is still undergoing treatment for
post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been very helpful to read about post-traumatic stress
disorder and depression, but still I get very jumpy and fidgety
when stressed,'' Carlos said.
</P>
<P>
   This happens particularly when he sees people in military
uniforms or when someone approaches him from behind. ``(The Center)
has been excellent. I have found support. I'm getting the
opportunity to be a person with some opportunities to be a person
again. That has helped a lot with my trauma and pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston is also home to the International Survivors Center at the
International Institute of Boston. The center offers mental-health
services to survivors with an emphasis on rehabilitation and
returning the individual to self-sufficiency. The program will
serve about 85 survivors this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people move to the US searching for security,'' said
Kathleen Allden, medical director of the center. ``As Americans,
look at it as how we can welcome newcomers, assist them in
exploration of their new country. That will improve the
self-confidence of those individuals.''
</P>

FILMMAKERS CHOOSE LESS COSTLY LOCATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With Movies-Teamsters; a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A movie about playing baseball in the Cape Cod League has been
shot in recent months _ in North Carolina. While the producers of
``Summer Catch'' will be filming scenes on the Cape for a few days
this week, the bulk of the $20 million movie was filmed in
Wilmington, N.C., because of the filmmakers' concerns that they
would face problems with Teamsters' Local 25.
</P>
<P>
   According to several independent and studio filmmakers, dealing
with Local 25, which controls Teamster contracts for movies made in
Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, invariably
presents sizable financial costs as well as aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not worth it,'' said one Warner Bros. executive who
asked not to be identified. ``Their contract is just too expensive
and it's impossible to get them to compromise on anything. It's a
whole lot easier just to go somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official, who tracks the industry nationwide, estimated
that Massachusetts is losing out on as much as 50 percent of the
movie business it could attract because of studios' concerns about
dealing with the Teamsters. Last year, approximately $50 million
was spent in Massachusetts by the filmmaking industry, about half
of what was spent in 1997 when a major production, ``A Civil
Action,'' was filmed here.
</P>
<P>
   George Cashman, president of Local 25, agreed in an interview
Monday that his union does have either the first or second most
lucrative filmmkaking contracts in the nation, in terms of wages
paid to union members.
</P>
<P>
   While he acknowledged that industry executives often complain
about the costs of making films in Massachusetts, Cashman denied
that Local 25 refuses to compromise in negotiating contracts with
the producers of individual films, though he offered no specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are always complaining about the cost of doing business
here, but there's been many times that we've made concessions with
them that they never tell you about,'' Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Bros.' executive said the Teamsters have been
unwilling to compromise on several key contract provisions,
including one that stipulates the number of drivers assigned to
work on sets as well as another that pays crew chiefs whenever the
set is operating, regardless of whether they are needed or if
shooting is being done.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the minute that the coffee gets put on in the morning at
a set, the Teamster drivers are getting paid,'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Movie executives also complained that the members of the
Teamster work crews are often unfamiliar with the sophisticated
equipment that must be moved around a set, but that Local 25
officials have steadfastly refused to allow any Teamster members
from other locals who specialize in such equipment from being
assigned to the set, unless accompanied by a Local 25 member.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros., which is producing ``Summer Catch,'' is not the
only studio to decide in recent months to shoot a movie that has a
decidedly local storyline out of state. Producers of ``Prozac
Nation'' and ``The Harvard Man,'' both of which concern Harvard
University students, decided to do the bulk of their shooting in
Canada, minimizing filming in and around Boston to a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman, who has been president of Local 25 for nine years, said
it is expensive for any enterprise to do business in Massachusetts
and that Local 25 should not be faulted for insisting that
moviemakers pay higher-than-average costs for filming here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very profitable industry,'' Cashman said. ``We are
only asking that our members get their due share.'' If the
situation were as dire as some producers contend, Cashman said,
studios would not continue to do business in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, two comedies _ MGM's ``What's The Worst That Could
Happen'' and the Farrelly Brothers' ``Osmosis Jones'' _ are being
filmed in Boston and Plymouth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Dawson, executive director of the Massachusetts Film
Bureau, acknowledged that some moviemakers wanted to shoot their
films in Massachusetts because the story was centered here but
decided to shoot elsewhere because of problems with the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Location decisions are driven by budget and yes, the Teamster
budget is one of the highest cost elements of a production,''
Dawson said. ``Filmmakers have told me it weighs heavily on whether
a production will decide to shoot here.''
</P>
<P>
   John Birtwell, spokesman for Governor Paul Cellucci, said that
one or two studio executives had complained directly to Cellucci
about the Teamsters when the governor went to Hollywood in 1997 and
again in 1999. Cashman accompanied Cellucci on both trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found more often than not is that it was anecdotal
rather than anything pervasive,'' said Birtwell. ``There seems to
be a lot of talk without much hard evidence.''

BUSH'S PRIORITIES? LOOK AT TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ No matter what you feel about what can be called
``the mess in Texas,'' the truth is that principle is more involved
than accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Most people are correct to pay no political heed to numbers
indicating surplus, deficit, expenditures, and revenues.The real
deal, the one that is capable to moving opinion and potentially
votes, has to do with priorities.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of generations of the hoary maxim that the
government's accounts (state and federal) are just like the family
checkbook (they aren't), it's becoming more useful to think of
government as the reflection of choices and consequences: You can
do X, but that means you can't do Y.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, for example, you can use a third or more of the
state's prosperity-driven budget surplus, currently in the vicinity
of $1.5 billion for a two-year cycle, to cut property taxes in a
way that benefits wealthy and corporate real estate owners the
most, or you could finally give kids in Texas a statewide chance to
go to kindergarten and make preschool similarly available to all
who can't afford it (as in all normal people).
</P>
<P>
   But you can't do both. And Bush has chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, as the surplus decade begins (at least on paper), you
can cut the top two income tax rates on the highest income-earners,
or you can take Medicare all the way out of the federal budget
swamp and use its current surpluses to help pay off the national
debt as well as establish a universal prescription drug benefit
within that system.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't do both. And Bush has chosen.
</P>
<P>
   That explains Texas more fully; it also explains the argument
over the commitments worth making nationally over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   As an accounting argument, George W. Bush is justified in
insisting that the state he has technically run for the last five
years is in the black. And Al Gore is fudging words when he tries
to use the likes of ``shortfall'' in his campaign rhetoric to imply
otherwise. The fact is that the black ink overall from higher
sales, energy severance, and other tax sources is likely to cover
the operating deficits in the specific accounts of major state
programs like health care and the sprawling prison system.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's debating victory on this point is Pyrrhic. For one
thing, his much more successful fellow governors don't go around
the country bragging about the fact that program deficits have
already consumed at least 50 percent of the aniticipated surplus
and that the rainy day fund is now down to a measly $250 million,
enough to run the state for a day.
</P>
<P>
   They especially don't brag that the program deficits just so
happen to involve the public health and the public safety.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue is the Texas record, not the Texas budget,
and here Bush takes his place as guardian of an especially
miserable status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is not the Deep South. It is not a place with a tradition
of exploitation by Yankee investors or a backward economy offering
business operators a chance to get rich off cheap, nonunion
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is different because Texas is wealthy. It is more than
oil, natural gas, and real estate _ the basis of a boom-and-bust
life in the past; it is now fully modern, getting more so, and it
is the country's principal suburb-dominated state next to New
Jersey. And that makes its Deep South approach to social services
for working families and the poor especially ugly.
</P>
<P>
   It is a system that has worked this way _ low taxes, no income
taxes, and rock-bottom quality services _ for decades. Bush is only
the latest operator, and he has actually been less malevolent than
many of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that because the choice has been low taxes
and, in the Bush era's case, nearly $2 billion lower still, along
with no modern regulation of either sprawl or industrial pollution,
there have been consequences.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Texas is more like Louisiana and Mississippi than
Florida or Ohio. And this is why 10 percent of the uninsured kids
in the entire country live there, why the squalid Colonias exist in
south Texas, why Houston has the dirtiest air in the country, and
why the state has the third highest death rate from asthma. It
could do better, but it chooses not to.
</P>
<P>
   This same philosophy looms on the nation's horizon, and again
the question is less about budget surpluses than it is about
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in Bush's ideological shoes, you oppose investment in
Medicare, expansion to cover drugs, universal preschool and health
insurance for kids, not to mention financing retirement accounts as
a supplement instead of a partial replacement for Social Security.
You do that because after slashing the top income tax rates and
abolishing the estate tax there's no money left to improve
services.
</P>
<P>
   Just like in Texas.

A SICILY SURPRISE: THE BEAUTY IS OVERWHELMING 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLORIA NEGRI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAORMINA, Sicily _ In early April, sirocco winds sprinkle desert
dust from North Africa onto the red-tiled roofs of this
breathtakingly beautiful resort high in the cliffs overlooking
Sicily's Ionian coast.
</P>
<P>
   Snow still lingers on the northern side of Mount Etna, Europe's
tallest and most active volcano; but ash from a lava-spewing crater
on the mountain's south side smudges tiled terraces and the hoods
of small cars parked along Taormina's narrow, cobbled streets.
</P>
<P>
   At night, Etna draws spectators to the Piazza IX Aprile to watch
its fire against the black sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mount Etna is definitely a girl,'' says our tour guide, Rosa
Rizza, formerly of Plainville, Conn., and a resident of Sicily for
23 years. ``She has to be. She has character and a heart and mind
of her own. She does what she wants when she wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Vulcanologists monitoring the situation describe it as ``normal
volcanic activity,'' which doesn't deter tourists from going in
droves to walk along the craters of the 11,000-foot volcano or take
a gondola ride to get even closer to the top.
</P>
<P>
   On the volcano, souvenir shops sell carvings of small animals
and jewelry made from the lava, but I am content with a chunk I
pick up from congealed piles that make a black pockmarked moonscape
of Etna's lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
   I have been to Italy twice before, but never to Sicily, an
island about the size of New Hampshire, across the mainland from
Reggio di Calabria in the toe of Italy's boot.
</P>
<P>
   I was not prepared for the beauty of the landscape _ its
skyscraping cliffs, its hairpin-curve mountain roads with their
precipitous drops and spectacular panoramic views _ its awesome
Greek-Roman ruins dating before Christ at places such as Siracusa,
Agrigento, and Morgantina, the warmth of its sun and of its people.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Sicily's beauty _ the blue-green waters of the
Miditerranean, the cypress trees standing like sentinels on the
cliffs, the wisteria, the prickly pear cactus, and tropical flowers
growing everywhere out of rock _ overwhelms the senses.
</P>
<P>
   Its clear mountain air bubbles like champagne. Its year-round
temperature is moderate, and Taormina's trade board boasts, ``We
have only two seasons, spring and summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I am here with a tour group organized by Durgan Travel
Service of Stoneham, among them repeat visitors to Sicily and some
who have come to find their roots. For me, a longtime lone
traveler, this trip would be different and I am happy to let
someone else worry about travel logistics, for a change.
</P>
<P>
   We are staying at the Hotel Ariston, a charming 176-room,
three-star hotel high on a cliff, at the foot of the ancient Greek
theater of Taormina and overlooking the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Built by the Greeks during the third century BC, the theater was
rebuilt by the Romans several centuries later and, because of its
outstanding acoustical properties, it is still used for musical
performances and film festivals.
</P>
<P>
   The Ariston meets all our needs. All three meals, included in
the package tour, are served in the hotel's dining room,
buffet-style for large groups, and are so delicious few care about
eating out.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Carmelo Catania oversees a staff in preparing all the
in-season vegetables and fruits, the locally-caught fish, the meat
and poultry, and the freshly baked breads. The fruited panetonne
with powdered sugar is especially delicious. Maitre d' Angelo
LaRosa, whose English wife is on the waitstaff, keeps the dining
room running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   From the Ariston, we have a short walk to the bus terminal where
our tours begin. Our guides tell us not only about the historic
sites of Sicily but about the Sicilian psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Sicily is a land that has been inhabited since the Ice Age.
Founded by the Sicels, from whom it got its name, it was, at
various times, colonized by the Phoenicians, who sailed into a
Sicilian harbor in the eighth century BC, the Carthaginians, the
Greeks, the Byzantines, the Arabs, the Saracens, the Normans, the
French, and the Spaniards before it became part of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Sicilians, however, remain defiantly ``Sicilian,'' speaking a
Sicilian dialect while being fiercely proud of their heritage. ``We
are Sicilians first, then Italians,'' says Rosa Rizza, one of the
local guides engaged by Durgan Travel. Rosa's parents are
Sicilian-born.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa was born in the States, but returned to Sicily with her
grandfather 23 years ago and enrolled in the University of Catania
to study archeology. She married a Sicilian and now, at 41, has two
teenage sons and dual citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   So, it didn't surprise me when another tour guide confirmed a
story I had heard back home that during World War II, Sicilians
wanted to become America's 49th state.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is true but, through no fault of their own, it couldn't
happen,'' said Salvatore Puglisi, our guide to Messina on a day so
clear one could almost reach out across the Strait of Messina and
touch Italy's mainland two miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to get a bridge built across the strait for
30 years,'' Salvatore said, shrugging. Now, ferry or hydrofoil make
the journey. Then, as our bus squeezed through a narrow passage
where cars were parked at all different angles, he chuckled and
said, ``In Sicily, our rule is to have no rules.''
</P>
<P>
   In Messina, with a population of 250,000, our driver skillfully
got our bus through to the Piazza del Duomo where Salvatore told us
about the history of the Cathedral of Messina and its famous bell
tower with its bronze, life-size figures that move when the clock
strikes on the quarter hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest mechanical clock in the world,'' he says,
and the figures describe four periods of a man's life _ infancy,
boyhood, as soldier, and as old man. At noon, the lion figure
roars, the cock crows, and the bells play Shubert's ``Ave Maria.''
</P>
<P>
   Sicily's beauty surprises and awes the senses at every turn,
just as its blood oranges, its olive, fig, and almond trees, and
its homegrown vegetables tantalize the palate.
</P>
<P>
   One day I left our tour to take an optional trip to Agrigento,
more than three hours southwest from Taormina, set on seeing the
Greek ruins, dating to the fifth century BC, at Agrigento's Valley
of the Temples.
</P>
<P>
   I was prepared to read during the long trip, but the scenery
along the superhighway made me put down my book.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the bus window were miles and miles of fields of emerald
green, undulating in the breeze. At first, I thought, ``What
well-kept lawns!'' until someone pointed out they were wheat
fields. We were passing through Sicily's breadbasket.
</P>
<P>
   Then came groves and groves of orange and lemon trees, olive
trees with their silvery-gray leaves, fig, and almond trees, all
thriving under the Mediterranean sun. Agriculture, we were told, is
the key factor in Sicily's economy, ahead of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   In Agrigento, the Valley of the Temples and the Archeological
Museum proved worth a 5 a.m. wake-up call I needed to catch the bus
and the $34 the daylong trip cost. The site is an archeologist's
dream and draws people from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, I understood why. It is to journey back to ancient
times to stand before the ruins of the Temple of Castor and Pollux,
built in the 5th century BC, the Temple of Zeus and the agora, the
eight remaining columns of the Temple of Hercules and the Temple of
Concordia, also built around the 5th century BC with its Doric
columns, but still in excellent condition.
</P>
<P>
   At night, the ruins are spotlighted and even more spectacular.
We learn, also, that the Sicilian writer and playwright Luigi
Pirandello was born in Agrigento in 1867.
</P>
<P>
   For some on the trip, the visit was a sentimental journey. As
many have done before them, they came to find their roots and the
relatives they had never met.
</P>
<P>
   Our guide, Rosa, has made hundreds of calls trying to connect
American visitors with their Sicilian kin, often successfully, such
as she did for two families among our group of 38.
</P>
<P>
   One night, in a touching scene in the lobby of the Hotel
Ariston, Joseph Stavolta, 54, of Burlington, and his wife, Sally,
met members of his father's family from Messina for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I wanted to do for a long time,'' Stavolta
said. ``I had a need to see where my roots are.''

LONDON'S ART EXPLOSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   London has always been known for its art museums. But the year
2000 has seen a flurry of openings or major improvements. These
three institutions make up our Museums of the Month:
</P>
<P>
   --The Tate Museum of Modern Art has turned darkness into light,
transforming the old and dreary Bankside Power Station on the south
side of the Thames River into its bright and airy new branch, Tate
Modern. The new site features international modern art from 1900 to
the present. And as a bonus, the seventh-floor windows offer one of
the best views in all of London of St. Paul's Cathedral. The
original Millbank site, now called Tate Britain, exhibits older
British art. The Tate is free except for special exhibits;
donations are welcomed. For more information, visit www.
</P>
<P>
   tate.org.uk.
</P>
<P>
   --Somerset House, one of Britain's great historic buildings,
opened to the public for the first time this spring. The 1,000-room
building, on the site of a 16th-century royal palace, houses two
major museums: the Gilbert Collection of decorative arts and the
Courtauld Institute Gallery with its noted collection of
Impressionist paintings. In the fall, the Hermitage Rooms, showing
highlights from the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, will
open. There is no charge to visit the Somerset House itself, but a
combination Gilbert-Courtauld ticket costs about $10.50 for adults;
separate admissions are about $6 each for adults. For more
information, visit www.somerset-house.org.uk.
</P>
<P>
   --The National Portrait Gallery, which houses the world's
largest portrait gallery, is heading into the 21st century with
more light, space, and elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Renovations provide for 50 percent more exhibition and public
space; a new central area from which one of London's largest
escalators rises to the second- floor galleries; a new Tudor
Gallery; and a new Balcony Gallery, adding space for portraits from
the 1960s to the '80s. The National Portrait Gallery even has
portraits of the Spice Girls, but don't let that stop you from
visiting. The gallery is free except for special exhibits;
donations are welcomed. For more information, check out
www.npg.org.uk.

MUSIC'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW OF JILL SCOTT'S ID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who is Jill Scott?
</P>
<P>
   That was the question many asked after listening to her soaring,
unbridled vocals on the 1999 album ``The Roots Come Alive.'' It was
Black Thought of the Roots who first introduced listeners to Scott.
Before launching into this hip-hop group's hit, ``You Got Me,''
which featured Erykah Badu, Black Thought set the record straight
about the true creative mind behind that song's hooky chorus:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you were worried about where
</P>
<P>
   I've been or who I saw
</P>
<P>
   Or what club I went to with my homies
</P>
<P>
   Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``On the song (originally on the CD, `Things Fall Apart'),
Erykah Badu is singing the chorus, this real smoothed-out melodic
(expletive), but guess what _ tonight I'm gonna introduce you to
the young lady from Philadelphia who wrote that piece,'' Black
Thought explains. ``She's down with the Roots crew, and she goes by
the name of Miss Jill Scott.''
</P>
<P>
   As ``Jilly from Philly,'' as Black Thought affectionately calls
Scott, began to sing, there was certainly more than a hint of
Baduizm. The inflections, the phrasing seemed pure Erykah, yet a
closer listen revealed a more soothing voice, but one that pierced
and stung like an arrow. With ?uestlove on drums and Scratch on the
turntables prodding along her jazzy improvisations, Scott tore the
roof off the joint, and made the song her own.
</P>
<P>
   On her debut CD, ``Who is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol. 1,''
Scott includes a minutelong snippet of her performance from that
concert, and the rest of this album proves her moment on stage with
the Roots was no fluke. When she says, ``Y'all ready to settle down
and get with this,'' on the CD's first cut, ``Jilltro,'' it's an
invitation and a challenge. A singer-songwriter, Scott takes her
place alongside such neo-soul saviors as Macy Gray, Lucy Pearl, and
D'Angelo as the latest artist to shun the de rigueur, assembly-line
limitations of contemporary R&AMP;B.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is Jill Scott?'' is a 72-minute contemplation of love lost
and found. Love is a symphony, love is a sorrow song. Men love and
treat her right, or behave badly. Sometimes she begs them to stay,
others she needs to kick to the curb. She warns other women eyeing
her man to ``back down before you get smacked down,'' and finally
learns that loving yourself is perhaps the greatest feat of all.
</P>
<P>
   On every song, from the painful wanting of ``Do You Remember,''
to the funky collard greens and black-eyed peas chorus of ``It's
Love,'' to the sweeping strings of ``The Way,'' Scott creates a
full-scale montage of emotions. Like love, the CD is sexy, sad, and
beyond simplistic descriptions. Whether she's evoking a quiet-storm
mood, or an insinuating head-bopping groove, this is a funky,
fearless album by a true talent who, thankfully, is not the
creation of some knob-twiddling producer trying to cajole soul from
yet another pretty stone.
</P>
<P>
   It probably says a great deal about Scott that, on her album's
acknowledgements, she cites as ``two of my true inspirations, _
``Mr. Christopher Wallace'' _ that's Biggie Smalls, y'all _ and
``Miss Sarah Vaughn.'' There's certainly a hip-hop sensibility in
such cuts as the erotic spoken-word pieces, ``Exclusively,'' and
``Love Rain.'' But there's also all this jazz in songs like ``A
Long Walk'' and ``He Loves Me'' in the way she weaves words in and
out of the music, and making her voice another instrument. She has
a remarkable sense musically of what came before, and a clear
vision of where she wants to take her own mesmerizing rhythms and
inspirations.
</P>
<P>
   If there's any justice, Jill Scott's will be the voice pumping
out of speakers this summer and beyond. In an industry running on
artificiality these days, Scott is bringing something real. After
this CD, one of the best of the year, the question should no longer
be ``Who is Jill Scott?'' but what took her so long to get here.

<P>
   CAPE FEAR, N.C. _ Michael Jordan played high school basketball
in this neck of the woods and I want to be like Mike. I want some
hang time, but the problem is I can't jump. Not with a basketball
because I naturally embrace gravity, and not from an airplane
because with my luck the worker who folds my parachute has either a
massive hangover, just received a pink slip, has ties to Khadafy,
or all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Originally I came here merely seeking warm waters. I thought it
would be worth it to fly to Wilmington, N.C., halfway between New
York and Miami, to soak in the 80-degree surf at Wrightsville Beach
and enjoy what has been chosen as one of the top 10 beaches in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last year's hurricanes, the beach here is pretty
terrific, the waves and sandy bottom are perfect for body surfing,
and the natives are friendly. In fact the only sign that this is
prime hurricane territory is the street signs near the beach
warning about how many feet underwater you will be in the event of
a Category Five hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting under an umbrella out on a pier at the Oceanic
restaurant, feasting on crab soaked in curry and sipping ice cold
beer at reasonable prices is the epitome of the good life. Pelicans
cruise by in formation and fishing boats follow the swarming birds
offshore.
</P>
<P>
   I'm content until I see a multicolored parasail being towed just
offshore. Wouldn't it be fun to float over the ocean with a
pelican's-eye view of Cape Fear?
</P>
<P>
   So, after entertaining the locals by hopscotching across the
sun-baked blacktop in bare feet, I've driven to the Wrightsville
Parasailing Co. on Airlie Marina (phone 910-232-1235) and signed
without reading a small-type agreement that releases the company
from liability should I break free of my safety harness and wind up
as shark food in the Bermuda Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Six of us have paid $45 apiece and boarded a special parasail
boat with a carpeted takeoff and landing platform in the aft. Our
captain, the jovial Jay Dalton, informs us that we will be gone for
two hours and will each fly for about 15 minutes. He says that he
has flown people from ages 3-82 in the last three years and has
never had an accident.
</P>
<P>
   But when we get out to sea his smile fades. He warns us that
something terrible could happen. That if we don't place the harness
just above our knees and allow centrifugal force to move it higher,
then we will get a ``parasail wedgie'' and have to endure our ride
sounding like Frankie Valli of the Four Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Part of our group consists of two wide-eyed young women from
Easton, Pa., celebrating their high school graduation, and a couple
of their male friends from South Carolina. Because these hardbodies
weigh less than 300 pounds per couple, they can fly in groups of
two. Because I've had a big breakfast this morning, and every
morning for the last 40-odd years, my wife and I can't fly
together.
</P>
<P>
   One of the South Carolina guys eyes me as if I have more
frequent flier miles than Madeleine Albright. ``Ever do this
before?'' he asks. I tell him the truth: ``Once before, years ago
off the beach in Mexico. But tequilla was involved and I remember
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalton, a semiconductor process engineer who works in Raleigh
during the week, tells us that parasailing off the beach or from
stationary platforms is unsafe. He will launch us from his boat
``Live Like Libby'' with a winch and tow line that will keep the
parasail low enough so that it doesn't register as a hailstorm on
the Weather Channel radar.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton promises me that if I take my $2,000 camera with me on my
flight, he can keep it dry. Twelve seconds later a wave crashes
over the bow. Everybody gets wet.
</P>
<P>
   When we finally get off the coast of Cape Fear, Dalton pulls out
an anemometer and takes a wind reading: 11.7 m.p.h. Dalton says he
will not allow parasailing if the wind hits 15 m.p.h. ``Too
dangerous,'' he says. ``I cancel 40 percent of my trips because of
high winds or rough seas. We don't take chances.'' Accidents happen
because parasailing firms are greedy or don't have the proper
equipment or let out too much tow line and lose control, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his horror stories make you want to stay at home. A
young woman drowned while parasailing in the Bahamas recently, and
famous O.J. Simpson lawyer Johnnie Cochran is suing for $5 million
in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Although we are required to wear a life vest, Dalton gives no
briefing on emergency water landings. We might drown but at least
nobody on this boat will drown with a wedgie.
</P>
<P>
   When I get home, I find some sobering facts. Over the past 10
years there have been 230 parasailing accidents, resulting in 11
deaths, according to the Parasail Safety Council.
</P>
<P>
   But 500 yards off the southeastern coast of North Carolina, on a
sun-drenched afternoon with a nice breeze, nobody's thinking of
becoming a statistic. The first couple goes up amid whoops of joy.
Rachael Bombardier holds the straps so hard her hands hurt. By
controlling the tow line and the speed of the boat, Dalton shoots
them up to 200 feet then lets them slowly descend for a brief dip
in the water. But when they are about two feet over the ocean, he
tells us to all point and scream, ``Shark!''. Startled, Bombardier
jolts her feet skyward. ``If you lift your feet up the shark's
gonna bite your butt,'' yells Dalton before he pops them back up in
the air like a helium balloon let loose.
</P>
<P>
   My flight is a blast. At 150 feet up and 250 feet out from the
boat, I'm floating over Cape Fear with no fear, until I use both
hands to take pictures and realize there's no net below me. I don't
want to wind up like the German U-352 submarine sunk off the coast
here during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The view alone is worth the money. I can see Wrightsville Beach,
clean and spacious with the surf rolling in hypnotically. I can see
Figure of Eight island, a gated community where a host of famous
people including Kim Bassinger, Alec Guinness, and Vice President
Al Gore vacation.
</P>
<P>
   I can see Wilmington, a hip eclectic city on the Cape Fear
River, which has rightfully turned up in the book ``The 100 Best
Small Art Towns in America.'' This month, some streets are blocked
off because Jody Foster is shooting a new film. Wilmington
generates more film revenue than any city other than LA and New
York. There are also just enough funky boutiques, restaurants,
antique shops, paddle boats, coffee houses, and clip-clopping
carriage rides to make this a charming and romantic destination.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Fear Museum in Wilmington has a Michael Jordan exhibit
that has artifacts from the days before he became His Airness. They
include the $119.76 pay stub dated July 20, 1980, from his
after-school job working at Whitey's El-Berta restaurant in
Wilmington, a certificate for perfect attendance from the New
Hanover County schools, and some of his old books including the
classic, ``White Fang'' by Jack London and the prophetic
``Basketball for Young Champions.'' Jordan has also financed a
Michael Jordan Discovery Center at the museum, a hands-on
children's exhibit on primary ecosystems in the North Carolina
coastal environment.
</P>
<P>
   And from the air, the environment looks pretty darn good. I hear
no engines. It's just the whoosh of the parasail above, a couple of
seagulls riding shotgun off in the distance, and a little white
boat bobbing slowly in the warm waters off Cape Fear.

   GOP-HOFFA _ PHILADELPHIA _ Teamsters President James P. Hoffa
will attend the Republican National Convention as the guest of
honor at a reception hosted by GOP Chairman Jim Nicholson,
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge and 10 Republican members of Congress.
``This should not be construed as a message to any presidential

   RAND-SCHOOLS _ WASHINGTON _ Three popular education reforms seem
to have worked in some states between 1990 and 1996, according to a
massive RAND Corp. report to be released here Tuesday. Comparing
NAEP achievement scores by students from similar families from 44
states, the researchers found that fast-improving states like North
Carolina and Texas had smaller classes in the early grades, more
kids in public pre-kindergarten programs and a higher number of
teachers who said they had adequate resources than was true in
states like Georgia, where scores stagnated, or California, where
scores plunged in those years. Some other plausible explanations _
such as higher scores by students whose teachers had masters
degrees or higher salaries _ didn't pan out. But, years after the
fact, it now appears that the post-1996 decisions by policy-makers
to stress pre-k classes in Georgia and to lower class size in
grades 1 to 3 in California were smart moves. (Mollison, Cox News

took off from Charles de Gaulle Airport with German tourists on

failed its third test, the one ballyhooed as the most telling.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ As if the Middle East negotiations weren't

suggested that Jerusalem, the heretofore unfixable sticking point
of any negotiations, be internationally controlled. It has a

boos from merger opponents. In the seven months since the two
companies announced plans to combine forces, opposition has been
growing from companies that fear the creation of an ``arrogant''

Red Gorilla, competitors are complaining about what they consider
abusive business practices by either AOL or Time Warner. (Geewax,

   TOO-MUCH _ Call it the revolt of the Soccer Mom. With the
proliferation of kid activities, and the sprawl that means they are
further apart, many families find they spend more time on the road
or with Little League coaches than with each other. With all the
shuttling, the average American mother now makes 5.5 car trips per
day, up from 3.5 in 1983, and compared with 4.5 trips for the

That makes its dollar-for-dollar return not so golden. The really

we're just playing one. (Pousner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

AMERICANA AT ITS FINEST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Pure Americana. That's the best way to describe Shelburne Museum
in Shelburne, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you've never been there. Only about 100,000 people
venture onto the 45 acres that make up this museum. But there's
never been a better time to visit than this summer, when a number
of new exhibitions have opened.
</P>
<P>
   First, a look at what's there. Shelburne has one of the
country's most extensive collections of Americana. Its folk art
collections include decoys and miniature carvings, weather vanes,
trade figures and signs, carousel figures, quilts, and hooked and
sewn rugs. Its decorative art collections include glass, ceramic,
pewter, metalwork, scrimshaw, and 18th- and 19th-century
paint-decorated furniture. Its fine-art galleries include important
works by American painters and by French Impressionists Corot,
Degas, Manet, and Monet (the museum's founder, Electra Havemeyer
Webb, was the daughter of H.O. and Louisine Havemeyer, who led
American interest in Impressionism).
</P>
<P>
   Shelburne's 37 historic exhibition buildings hold 150,000
objects. On the grounds you'll find historic houses, a lighthouse,
a two-lane covered bridge, a steam locomotive, a vintage carousel,
a general store, and the restored, 220-foot steamboat Ticonderoga,
a national historic landmark. That alone is worth the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitions on view this summer include: ``The Fabulous '50s:
Welcome Home to Post-War Vermont,'' with a ``historic house'' that
shows life as it was in June 1950; ``The Saturday Evening Post and
America's Great Illustrators: Norman Rockwell and Others,'' with
original paintings and reproduced covers from the heyday of the
Saturday Evening Post; ``Landscape and Light: Paintings by Martin
Johnson Heade,'' a showcase of the museum's extensive collection of
Heade paintings; ``Gather 'Round: Tales of New England's Workaday
World,'' a multimedia experience of work in New England during the
last 100 years; ``Something Old, Something New: American Decorative
Art and Furnishings, 1700-1820,'' highlighting furnishings from the
museum's collections; ``Settlers' Home,'' telling the story of a
Vermont family in 1795; and ``From George Washington to P.T.
Barnum: Prints from the Shelburne Museum,'' showcasing the museum's
historical, circus, sporting, and maritime prints.
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming at Shelburne is a Sotheby's Heirloom Appraisal Day on
Sept. 23-24 and the perennial favorite ``Celebrations of the
Season,'' a re-creation of an old-time New England Christmas, Dec.
1-2.

   This one's for me. ``Drink and Be Merry: Wine and Beer in
Ancient Times'' opens next Sunday at the Jewish Museum in New York
City. The exhibit, through Nov. 5, presents 5,000 years of drinking
culture in the eastern Mediterranean and Near East through an
exhibition of more than 180 objects. Organized by the Israel Museum
in Jerusalem, the exhibition explores two of the oldest known
beverages, valued throughout time for their abilities to lift
spirits, inspire religious fervor, deaden pain, and cure illness.
Wine and beer are among the oldest alcoholic beverages known,
originating in at least the sixth through fourth millennia BC in
the lands of the ancient Near East. While beer was the popular
drink at first, with wine being costly and rare, over time wine
became the most common drink. The Jewish sages even said, ``One in
whose home wine does not flow like water is not blessed.'' The
museum's shop is offering a book on the topic. For more

   Some of the top chefs and wine experts are heading to Vermont
Aug. 11-13 for an epicurean adventure at the KitchenAid Vermont
Wine &AMP; Food Festival. ``Here is an opportunity to learn more about
entertaining with wine and food, about how the two complement each
other,'' said Meri Spicer, festival director. ``Cooking with flair
does not have to be complicated.'' The festival features book
signings, workshops, tastings, and seminars, and participants
select from a full menu of cooking classes. The core festival pass
is $249, and a la carte entry into the grand tasting tent is
available on Saturday and Sunday. A highlight is the Celebration of
the Chefs dinner, which is $125 a person. For more information on
the festival at Stratton Mountain, call 800-STRATTON or visit

works by Auguste Rodin are on view at the North Carolina Museum of
Art in Raleigh, including such sculptures as ``The Thinker'' and
``The Kiss.'' In addition, ``The Hand of God'' is making both its
US debut and its first public appearance since 1905. For more

Jellyfish on view

</P>
<P>
   They have no eyes, no brain, no heart, and they can wield a
painful sting. And, if you head to the ocean, chances are you've
come across them _ jellyfish. The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long
Beach, Calif., has just opened a gallery dedicated to the more than
one dozen sea jellies, as they are properly known. These mysterious
creatures have survived for more than 650 years and can range in
size from smaller than a pencil eraser to larger than a basketball
court, and consist of 95 percent water. The exhibit explores all
the wonders of these creatures, which are found on both coasts, and
tells which jellyfish to look out for. Included is a Sting-O-Meter
where you can safely find out what different sea jelly stings might
feel like. For information, call 562-590-3100.

   Puerto Rico, with a 500-year history of artistic life, has just
opened the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico in San Juan. The opening
exhibition, ``Treasures of Puerto Rican Painting,'' showcases the
rich talent of Puerto Rican artists and will be on view through
January. More than 250 pieces of art are being shown, including
works by the island's most recognized artists, Campche and Rafael
Tufino. There is also a five-acre sculpture garden. For information

Scenic highways

   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Thirty roads in 20 states have been designated All-American
Roads or National Scenic Byways for 2000. US Transportation
Secretary Mortimer Downey said the roads provide visitors with a
unique driving experience and are considered destinations unto
themselves. Being designated All-American Roads helps preserve
these roads that have become American icons, Downey said. In New
England, the Acadia Byway in Maine was named an All-American Road,
and named National Scenic Byways were Connecticut State Route 169
and the Merritt Parkway; Old Canada Road, Rangely Lakes, and
Schoodic scenic byways in Maine; and the Kancamagus Highway in New
Hampshire. For information, visit www.byways.org or call

Potholes in the roads
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you're on the road this summer, always read the fine print
and be a little skeptical when visiting historic sites, says James
W. Loewen, adjunct professor of sociology at The Catholic
University of America in Washington and author of ``Lies Across
America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong.'' Be wary, he says of
words such as ``traditional'' or ``according to.'' For example, he
notes that Lincoln's Birthplace Cabin in Hodgenville, Ky., was
actually built 30 years after Lincoln's death. ``The National Park
Service does not go out of its way to tell you the cabin is not
where Lincoln was born. In fact, signs tell tourists not to use
flash photography and risk damaging the logs,'' said Loewen. The
cold and starving image of George Washington in Valley Forge is
also false, he says. In fact it was a mild winter, and ``the food
was monotonous but adequate.''

Plastic anniversary
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Did you realize that the term ``charge it'' is just 50 years
old? In 1950, a world without cash was inconceivable, but that's
when ``plastic'' was born. In 1949 Frank McNamara dined at a New
York restaurant only to find he had left behind his wallet. That
incident, which he managed to finesse, led to his developing the
Diners Club Card. When he returned to the restaurant in February
1950, he paid the bill with a small cardboard card _ a Diners Club
Card _ and signed for the purchase. In the credit card industry,
that event is known as the First Supper. The credit card concept
soon caught fire, including a movie, ``The Man from the Diners
Club,'' and by 1952 became the first international charge card.
This year, Diners Club earned its third successive Freddie Award
for Best Affinity Charge Card Program. Its Club Rewards offers
points that never expire and other services. For information, call

HDTV COSTS MAKE ITS FUTURE LOOK FUZZY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kevin Miller remembers the first time he saw
high-definition television. It was at the Consumer Electronics Show
in Las Vegas. Zenith was demonstrating an HDTV broadcast of a Ray
Charles concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stunning,'' Miller said. ``You could see the beads of
sweat on his forehead as clearly as anything you've seen in real
life. When the camera zoomed in on the microphone, you could see
all the metal mesh. You saw the fingerprint smudges on the piano.
These kinds of details just jumped off the screen and freaked you
out. I couldn't wait to see more.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in January 1996. HDTV was heralded as the television of
the future. Four years later, the future hasn't come much closer.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is now audio-video editor of etown.com, a
consumer-electronics Webzine. He spends much of his time watching,
reviewing, tweaking, and installing the most high-tech televisions
on the market. But he's still waiting for HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the technology,'' he says. ``The technology is here,
HDTV sets are here. It's the chicken-egg problem _ that's what's
holding things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Chickens and eggs are the common metaphor that people in the
industry use to describe the predicament.
</P>
<P>
   The chickens are the network chiefs, who don't want to spend
millions of dollars on HDTV cameras, tape machines, and
transmission hardware when only a teeny segment of viewers own HDTV
sets and decoders.
</P>
<P>
   The eggs are the consumers, who don't want to spend thousands of
dollars on HDTV sets and decoders when the networks are
broadcasting only a handful of HDTV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle are the TV manufacturers, who can lower
prices on these sets only so far as long as consumer demand remains
so meager.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, they have cut prices by 20 to 50 percent.
However, that still leaves these sets at $2,000 minimum, with most
of them well more than double that, still too expensive for a
mass-market commodity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done our part, so when is there going to be something
worth watching?'' asks Dave Arland, spokesman for Thomson Consumer
Electronics, which owns RCA. ``People aren't going to make the
switch if there's not enough to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, ABC broadcast ``Monday Night Football'' in
high-definition. There were 32 local ABC stations with the hardware
to carry the beam. But, one network executive complained, ``We have
no idea how many people were watching. And there's no evidence that
the broadcast increased sales of HDTV sets.''
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic paid for the HD equipment and the HD transmission, at
a reported cost of $2.2 million for the season. But the deal will
not be renewed next season.
</P>
<P>
   Some public and cable networks are dipping into HDTV on their
own dime. PBS is experimenting, with WGBH in Boston leading the way
in producing programs in high-definition. The Discovery Channel
will start doing so next year. DirecTV satellites currently carry
one Showtime and two HBO channels that beam movies in HDTV format.
</P>
<P>
   The major networks are hesitating, unless the manufacturers pick
up the tab. Samsung has funded HD broadcasts of movies for CBS,
Thomson covered HD transmissions of the NCAA basketball tournament,
Sony supplies HD equipment for golf tournaments and for NBC's
``Tonight Show,'' the only program broadcast nightly in
high-definition.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi paid for HD broadcasts of CBS's entire prime-time
lineup this past season, but, like Panasonic and ``Monday Night
Football,'' the company is not renewing the deal, though it will
pay for some sports and specials. CBS is looking around for other
sponsors. Glen Dickson of Broadcasting &AMP; Cable Magazine says the
network will suspend the experiment if none are found.
</P>
<P>
   Many manufacturers are growing impatient. ``The gravy train is
over,'' Arland said. ``We're not Proctor &AMP; Gamble. It's time the TV
broadcasters, who have been given their free airwaves, make use of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is, new digital TV sets _ the only kind that can pick
up HDTV signals _ are selling better than expected. According to
the Consumer Electronics Association over 200,000 of these TVs have
been sold since coming on the market in August 1998. Sales so far
this year are 4 1/2 times larger than this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this market is but a speck on the larger horizon. There
are 250 million old-fashioned analog TV sets in US households _
meaning digital TVs constitute less than one-tenth of 1 percent of
what's out there.
</P>
<P>
   And this speck has little to do with HDTV. Gary Merson, author
of the Web newsletter hdtvinsider.com, said, ``HDTV programs are
not what's driving the digital TV market. It's DVD home-theater,''
which ``looks great on digital televisions.''
</P>
<P>
   To pick up HDTV broadcasts, even digital TVs must be hooked up
to special HD decoder boxes, the cheapest of which cost $650.
According to industry figures, just 33,000 of these boxes have been
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Callahan, marketing director for Princeton Graphics, which
makes computer and HDTV monitors, glumly asked, ``If you were Mike
Eisner, would you want to spend a lot of money to please 30,000
people?''
</P>
<P>
   Again: the chicken-and-egg problem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, HDTV does have appeal, for three reasons. First, it is
broadcast in widescreen, like a movie at a theater. By comparison,
normal TV images seem square and cramped.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it is broadcast digitally _ a series of coded zeros and
ones _ which means the signal comes in perfectly, with no
ghost-images.
</P>
<P>
   Third and most impressive, it is ``high-definition.'' A normal
TV image is made up of 480 lines. HDTV is made up of either 1,080
lines or 720 lines that are scanned twice as quickly. This accounts
for the vast improvement in detail, the you-are-there presence, and
for how smoothly people and objects move across the screen. Regular
TV and even DVDs seem murky and choppy by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you show people HDTV, they want it,'' said Kevin Miller.
``That's a fact. I've seen that response many times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission is pushing the networks to
pick up speed. FCC regulations require all broadcasters to shift
entirely to digital by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   First, while high-definition is digital, digital does not
necessarily mean high-definition.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Congress has added a proviso that this change-over will
take place only if 85 percent of US households have digital TVs.
Few believe this will be the case. For instance, commonplace as
cable TV seems today, it has penetrated just 67 percent of homes.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Consumer Electronics Association predicts that if
broadcasters go full-speed ahead, digital TVs will reach just 50
percent of homes by 2006. If delays continue, the estimate drops to
between 15 percent and 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, the networks know they can move at whatever
pace their cautious budgets allow.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Smith, head of the Boston-based Professional Audio/Video
Retailers Association, recently attended a summit of consumer
electronics CEOs. ``Everybody was saying that all the lobbying to
get broadcasters to move on HDTV just keeps hitting a brick wall,''
Smith recalls. ``It's very expensive for the broadcasters. It's
just not happening. It may not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Pete Putman, a video consultant and HDTV advocate,
said, ``We're still in a stage where things have just barely
begun.''
</P>
<P>
   The first nationwide HDTV broadcast took place in October 1998.
Since then, things have moved ahead far more swiftly than color TV
at its early stages.
</P>
<P>
   Color TV made its national debut in 1954, with a closed-circuit
telecast of the Rose Bowl Parade. Five years later, there were just
three shows televised regularly in color, all on NBC: ``Perry
Como,'' ``Bonanza,'' and ``Walt Disney's Wonderful World of
Color.'' Not till 1965 did all three networks start dipping their
toes into color.
</P>
<P>
   According to TV historian Ed Reitan, 1965 marked the first year
that more than 1 million color TV sets were manufactured, and the
typical set cost $1,000, a staggering sum at a time when the
average annual income was $7,200.
</P>
<P>
   It is striking that, in today's dollars, this price tag
translates to $5,600, the same as many of today's HDTV sets.
</P>
<P>
   There are two big differences between now and then, though.
``Back then, TV was about the only form of home entertainment,''
Putman says. ``Now people get it from lots of things. HDTV is going
to have to get a lot cheaper before a lot of people buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, back then, NBC, the network pushing color TV the
hardest, was owned by RCA, the company producing the most color TV
sets. There was a collusion for color between the biggest network
and the biggest manufacturer. Now, with HDTV, there is only
fighting, which everyone agrees might be the biggest stumbling
block on the road.

WHERE'S MY MONEY FOR NOT SMOKING?
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first question I had after reading about the $145 billion
cigarette verdict was: Why did I quit?
</P>
<P>
   The second question was: Is it too late to start again?
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well (which it never does), between 300,000 and
700,000 Florida smokers will divvy up the damages which, according
to my handy-dandy pocket calculator, works out to between $207,000
and $483,000 per nicotine addict, not counting attorneys fees, tip,
tax and valet parking.
</P>
<P>
   That'll buy you a lot of NicoDerm patches, with or without
health-care reform.
</P>
<P>
   When I was smoking, I had no idea the habit could be so
lucrative. In fact, one of the reasons I quit was because
cigarettes were getting too expensive. I figured the $30 a week I
saved on cigarettes could be better spent on more healthy products
like crack cocaine or glue.
</P>
<P>
   Little did I realize that I was cutting into my family's
inheritance by giving up the evil weed. What they thought was a
healthy decision was really a decision that doomed them to a life
of high-mileage used cars, macaroni-and-cheese dinners and
vacations in Oneco, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not like giving up cigarettes was easy. Far from it.
Looking back, it's hard to say who suffered more, me or my family.
During the first couple weeks of withdrawal, even the dog was
afraid to be around me. You've seen the movie ``Grumpy Old Men''? I
made Walter Matthau look like Barney the Dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   But I eventually conquered the addiction and there were no
noticeable side effects other than the fact that I gained 50 pounds
and now, according to my son, resemble the dad in Family Guy.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that an expanded waistline is not quite the same as
lung cancer or emphysema or heart disease, but I think it's clearly
a side effect of smoking and, as such, deserves some sort of
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   I also went through that terrible period of withdrawal,
inflicting who-knows-what kind of psychological damage on my wife,
son and dog. Therapy does not come cheap, in case you haven't
priced it lately. The Scandinavian-leather couches alone cost a
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Being a former smoker, I am, of course, one of the most
militant, obnoxious, uncompromising anti-smoking zealots on the
face of the planet. It is not enough, to me, that smokers are
prohibited from smoking on airplanes, in the workplace, in public
buildings, in restaurants and even in some bars. I don't think they
should be allowed to smoke anywhere that there is a chance, however
slim, of one stray molecule of smoke wafting in my direction.
</P>
<P>
   But I am, above all, a fair and just man, which is why I am
willing to set aside ``smoking permitted'' zones in the middle of
the Gobi Desert, in northern Greenland and on the dark side of the
moon. For a fee, permits will be issued for those who wish to smoke
underwater.
</P>
<P>
   I am only bringing this up because maintaining this level of
anti-smoking zealotry is not only exhausting, but also extremely
stressful. I can't calculate the days, months or years of my life
lost from the effort of glaring at smokers and fanning my hand in
front of my face in the most obvious fashion. All I know is the
toll is significant and most deserving of compensation.
</P>
<P>
   How much compensation? That is hard to say. But since I quit, I
figure I deserve more than whatever the 700,000 Florida smokers
will get, or however many are still alive if and when the money is
handed out.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that protracted litigation is tedious and expensive
for both sides, which is why I'm willing to settle for a paltry $1
million. If you invested the $145 billion, that probably represents
the interest that would accrue in one second. You can probably find
more than that in change underneath Bill Gates' sofa cushions.
</P>
<P>
   Why am I being so generous? Let's just say I feel sorry for the
tobacco companies and don't want to see them go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   At least until I get my money.
</P>

O. HENRY FACTS STRAIGHT UP, WITH A `TWIST' OF FICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
A TWIST AT THE END 
A Novel of O. Henry 
By Steven Saylor 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, 462 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Saylor has written seven books in the popular Roma Sub
Rosa mystery series, which the Texas-born novelist never intended
to go forth and multiply as they have. In a Boston interview a few
years ago, Saylor recounted how the publisher of ``Roman Blood''
had called to ask for a sequel. ``But I'm a literary novelist,''
Saylor exclaimed, hanging up _ before calling back to take the
publisher up on the offer.
</P>
<P>
   It is a virtue of Saylor's mysteries set in ancient Rome that
his writing does have literary distinction; he has not only
researched the time of Cicero but has imagined himself there. Now
he has taken a temporary sabbatical from dark doings in marble
alleys to write a determinedly literary novel about the writer O.
Henry _ more specifically, about an unsolved series of murders in
Austin, Texas, in the late 1880s, when the young William Sydney
Porter lived there, years before he adopted a pen name and became
just about the most famous storyteller in America. (Even today it
is difficult to escape ``The Gift of the Magi'' at Christmas, and
any unexpected twist at the close of a story is called an ``O.
Henry ending,'' usually disparagingly.)
</P>
<P>
   Will is only in his mid-20s during most of the novel, an
amiable, directionless young man with a handsome ginger mustache
and a pleasant bass voice he uses to serenade pretty young ladies
and sing in ``The Mikado.'' In a series of meaningless jobs and in
a habit of noticing people and things, he is accumulating
experiences that will serve him well later on, though he doesn't
know it yet; he has vague ambitions to become a writer without
realizing that he is one.
</P>
<P>
   Saylor's strategy is to bring what is known about O. Henry in
this period into alignment with what is known about personalities
and events in Austin at the same time. Will meets the
independent-minded German-born sculptor Elisabet Ney, for example;
Ney has a very individual way of speaking English in German syntax,
as her letters indicate she actually did. Will attends sessions of
the legislature during which a bill requiring the state government
to hire female clerks is being debated, and learns of the brutal
police beating of an innocent black man, an incident documented by
history.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, Saylor brings Will into the middle of a
grisly series of murders. The cases were never solved, but Saylor
provides a solution that is congruent with all the facts. The first
victims were African-American servants, and Will dubs the
perpetrators the ``servant girl annihilators.'' The last two
killings are of white women; press and the city go crazy. Some
suspects are found and framed by a particularly dense and racist
police force; there are a couple of trials, and the second of them
is full of steamy revelations when two of the town's madams are
forced to take the stand. The madams did exist, and they stand
alongside Saylor's fictional characters, inventions, and
semi-inventions _ a couple of con men, for example, who recall the
Duke and the Dauphin in ``Huckleberry Finn.'' There is also a
framing story set forward in 1906 _ when O. Henry is famous, in New
York, and haunted by his past _ not to mention some elaborate
strands of symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   The solution to the crimes, like an O. Henry ending, is more
ingenious than satisfying, and the novel itself stubbornly refuses
to come to life the way Saylor's Roman novels invariably do. The
characters tend to fall into stereotypes long familiar from Western
movies, and as the author downloads years of note-taking, one
occasionally feels he knows too much and imagines too little.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a quality in the book, and in the writing, that
does carry a reader through: It's Saylor's obsessive infatuation
with the place and time. ``A Twist at the End'' is not really a
novel of O. Henry; it is a novel of Austin by a writer who arrived
there as a student at the University of Texas and who still spends
part of every year there. Saylor loves the geography of the city,
its streets, houses, and buildings, and the diverse people who live
in them. He delights in evoking period detail of the interiors,
furnishings, carpets, and pictures, as well as placing the reader
in the timeless natural landscape of hills and the winding Colorado
River. The book isn't exactly a celebration of Austin, because the
city's gaudy past of fancy women, corrupt and conniving
politicians, hypocrisy, sexism, and racism is not much to celebrate
_ though there was also honor and decency and vision. Trying to
understand it all is a perfectly good way of trying to understand
ourselves.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEYMOUTH, Mass. _ In a strip-mall storefront near the former
naval air base lies an emotional front line for body-image angst.
And Andrea Nicholson may as well be the Florence Nightingale of
this battlefield, selling swimsuits at Ujena to women who mostly
see flawed hips, abdomens, or chests taunting them in the dressing
room mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   For four summers Nicholson, a 20-year-old dental hygienist in
training, has had what seems like a simple job: Be attentive. Keep
the store clean. Watch that the clip hangers don't snag the
merchandise. And most important, make sure customers leave with the
most flattering suits.
</P>
<P>
   The last is the difficult part _ convincing women that they can
look good in a bathing suit.
</P>
<P>
   One recent cloudy day, a middle-aged shopper heads straight to
the racks, quickly scours them for two-piece suits, and strides
into a fitting room. A few minutes later, the customer hands over
the pile of rejects and leaves before Nicholson can say, ``May I
help you?''
</P>
<P>
   This Nicholson knows for certain: She's not the only woman who
would like the figure of a supermodel, even though she's fit and
thin enough that some customers might be satisfied to swap bodies
with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see women in here that are beautiful. Look awesome in
bathing suits. Everybody has something about their bodies that
they're self-conscious about,'' Nicholson says. ``It definitely
makes me feel more comfortable with the fact that it's just not me
who feels that way. You can pick your body apart and let it consume
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson's neighbor, Peter O'Keefe, who owns two Ujena
franchises, told her she could work for him when she turned 16.
She's been here every summer since then, and now earns money for
college textbooks while getting an education she never expected in
self-image and fragile psyches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing my boss ever said to me is `Don't ever let
somebody leave the store looking bad.' I thought, `How can I say
that to them?' But they're very open to other people's advice. We
usually tell them if something doesn't look right,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just helping them look good in a bathing suit,'' she
adds. ``You're boosting their self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson tries to stanch customers' frustration by making sure
they have the right size, immediately. But alas, on this particular
morning, the only person in the store who seems happy _ besides
Nicholson _ is the delivery man.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about guys and bathing suits?
</P>
<P>
   She thinks it's ``ridiculous'' when women let their boyfriends
or husbands choose the bathing suit they buy instead of just
offering advice. ``There are some guys who are angels. But guys are
guys,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I tell boys I work at a bathing-suits store, it's like
`ooooh,' '' she adds. Then the wisecracks start: Do you model them?
``It's not like that,'' says Nicholson, who, on this particular
day, is wearing a handkerchief-print sundress and platform sandals,
not the merchandise, at work. ``It's just retail.''
</P>
<P>
   This retail store specializes in D cups, allowing customers to
choose the bra of a two-piece suit in one size and the bottoms in
another. So maybe it's to be expected that the figure dilemma most
of Nicholson's customers face is above, not below, the waist. ``So
many girls, even myself, have big chests,'' she says. ``It's a
self-conscious thing. You're showing more than you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice? Go up a size in the top and down one size for
bottoms because they stretch when they hit water. Sagging bikinis,
Nicholson notes, like everything else that sags, can be really
unattractive.
</P>
<P>
   Think again, she adds, before opting for a one-piece suit to
cover a large chest. Often maillots offer little support _ even
with those elastic-bands-as-underwires _ and hence don't always
look best. Surprisingly, bandeau tops look better on many women
than customers believe. Larger-busted women should consider a
properly fitting bikini, as should more average sizes. A 34B woman
should pick a medium-size top, she says, pointing to a wall of
suits, and ``take the pads out.''
</P>
<P>
   To the customer concerned about her hips (but not her belly),
Nicholson suggests that string bikini bottoms _ believe it or not _
can be slenderizing. ``Sometimes if you have chubby legs,'' she
advises skeptical customers, ``it's best not to get something
fuller.'' And it takes ``pencil-thin legs'' to make shorts-style
bottoms flattering. ``I can't wear them for anything,'' Nicholson
says.
</P>
<P>
   What about skirted suits? Here Nicholson is the equivocating
saleswoman. ``Um,'' she says, ``people like the coverage. A lot of
mothers come in for tankinis and skirts.''
</P>
<P>
   And style? Thongs are popular this year. ``To each his own,''
Nicholson says. Matching mother/daughter suits, she adds, are
``very cute.'' And silver lame is a trend on the upswing.
</P>
<P>
   To the customers who wander in looking for beach chairs or
plastic nose protectors to block the sun, Nicholson says sorry, she
sells only bathing suits and cover-ups.
</P>
<P>
   During the lull between customers, Nicholson vacuums the gray
industrial-grade carpeting or straightens the racks and racks of
bikinis, strings everywhere. She wipes down the two tanning beds,
tucked in the back of the store, after each use.
</P>
<P>
   After watching customers, many of whom ``are addicted'' to the
20 minutes of solitude under the tanning lights, Nicholson was
moved to try it herself. She was so nervous the first time she
tanned that she accidentally left on her socks. Now, she does it
once a week, for free, and hopes she's not doing it often enough to
tempt skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   So it's hard to tell from looking at her that, between work and
summer school, Nicholson doesn't get much chance to go to the beach
in the cornflower blue string bikini that she bought with an
employee discount at Ujena.
</P>
<P>
   But when she does, she says, ``I get so excited when I see a
Ujena suit.''

NEW CHAMPION OF ITALY'S CAUSE IS AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Paul Cayard sailed Italy to a Louis Vuitton Cup victory in
1992 _ symbolic of the top challenger for the America's Cup _ there
was a tinge of disappointment among Italians that it took an
American rock star to lead them to glory.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Louis Vuitton Cup again last February in Auckland
was sweeter, though San Diegan Doug Peterson helped pen the design
lines for Prada and Brazilian tactician Torben Grael called many of
the race moves. Still, syndicate chief Patrizio Bertelli was so
energized he left New Zealand tossing high-fashion Prada sunglasses
to everyone in sight and was already planning his 2003 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be another Italian stallion ready to make a move _
42-year-old Napolitan sailor Vincenzo Onorato, who has been racing
in Newport this month and was just crowned IMS World Champion in
the Cruiser/Racer division. Onorato took the honors at the wheel of
his new Farr 43 called Mascalzone Latino.
</P>
<P>
   The American boat Vim won the Racing division as a pair of
America's Cuppers _ Terry Hutchinson on Vim and Ken Read at the
helm of Idler, the runner-up _ went to war all week in the five-day
Rolex IMS Offshore World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Owner of the shipping firm Moby Lines in the Mediterranean,
Onorato raised some eyebrows around Newport when he said in an
interview that entering the America's Cup is more than merely a
dream, but that he intends ``to organize an all-Italian America's
Cup team'' that might draw on the pool of free-agent talent from
throughout the world, but that non-Italians ``won't have a role
onboard during the races.''
</P>
<P>
   Onorato brings some weighty race credentials, and thus
credibility, to a possible run for ye auld mug, and Italians have
been passionate about America's Cup racing since the Azzurra team
splashed in at Newport in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Onorato began racing as a 21-year-old in 1978, and his list of
accomplishments include second place in the Farr 40 division at GMC
Yukon Yachting Key West Race Week, and he was a member of the
European Admiral's Cup team that placed second this year.
</P>
<P>
   But he is also a realist, who says he does not want to ``make a
lot of noise'' about his possible Cup entry until ``I have all my
facts together. I don't have to invent stories about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows, for example, that if he did muster up a Cup challenge,
he would not win the first time around. Anyone who thinks such a
thing is possible, in his term, is ``ingenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he does have additional backing from a Japanese
insurance company, Yasuda Kasai, though he acknowledges that if
finances are not a worry, there are many technical roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   First, the lack of good used IACC boats. Without a good boat, he
says, it's hard to start a training program. Also, ``there are not
many sailors in Italy capable of covering the role of skipper in an
America's Cup syndicate.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Onorato has signed on a designer, Giovanni Ceccarelli,
who has designed his share of modern winners, and though he seems
beset by many problems to solve if he hopes to meet his
self-imposed decision deadline in October, Onorato says: ``The
chance I will do it is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Newport last week, Vim, whose owner Craig Speck
had fitted his Nelson/Marek 43-footer with a new keel, and whose
crew was laden with star talent, placed 1-1-1-5 for a 14.75 score,
just three ahead of Idler, which placed 2-5-3-3 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   In third place was another Italian boat, Atlantico Yah-Man, a
Frers 39 owned by Vittorio Rava from Milan, which scored 17.87 with
finishes of 4-6-6-1. At the helm was Tomasso Chieffi, skipper the
1986 America's Cup entry, Italia.
</P>
<P>
   Winning skipper Terry Hutchinson, an Annapolis sailor who was
mainsheet trimmer for Cayard's AmericaOne campaign in Auckland,
praised Speck the excellent showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took Bruce's and my recommendations about the boat, about
the crew choice, and now it has paid off.'' With some light-air
days and one day with winds exceeding 30 knots, Vim showed speed
over a range of conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Newport's Ken Read, who helmed Team Dennis Conner's Aukland
entry Stars &AMP; Stripes, called tactics aboard Idler and praised the
victor. ``The fact is they sailed better than us, and I've had my
share of regattas where we've won when racing was cancelled on the
the final day. You live by the sword, die by the sword,'' Read
said, referring to the light flukey winds that forced cancellation
of the last day of racing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America's Cup winner Russell Coutts spoke to about 200 people at
the Pleon Yacht Club fund-raiser Tuesday night. Earlier in the day,
about 150 youngsters from Pleon, the junior sailing club, had a
90-minute session with Coutts, most of them curious about his rise
to become one of the most accomplished sailors in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts, who skippered New Zealand to consecutive America's Cups
victories in 1995 and 2000, stunned his team when he and tactician
Brad Butterworth defected to sail for Switzerland in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts handled the matter up front, telling the audience that
money ($4 million to $5 million, according to most speculation) was
one of the major factors in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the Swiss are at a tremendous disadvantage,
and that just as America's loss of the Cup in 1983 was good for
international sailing, so would it be good for the Cup if New
Zealand loses it. Coutts was smiling when he said it, though it is
clear he means it.
</P>
<P>
   Said John Collins, PHRF rater and long time race official in
Marblehead, Mass.: ``Everyone in the audience felt that here is a
professional athlete who tells the truth.''

WOODS IN RARER AIR THAN EVEN JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In most cases, the idea is simple: smile, take the praise, and
be on your way without asking any questions. You are Tiger Woods,
surrounded by thousands who are prepared to fit you with a precious
(itals)I Am The Next Michael Jordan(unitals) crown. This is a
compliment _ usually.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a great athlete/pop culture success story, retired from
the Chicago Bulls on Jan. 13, 1999. By Jan. 14 the sports world was
Camelot, with daily tests to see which athlete would be picked to
pull a Jordan-autographed sword out of a stone.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm, Vince Carter, and Kobe Bryant have been among the
frequent nominees. And now that the 24-year-old Woods has become
the youngest golfer to win the sport's grand slam, the public has
decided that it's his turn, although there is no comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Woods? The next Jordan? When you consider the athletic and
social legacy created by both men, you'll see that placing their
names in the same sentence is indeed a compliment. For Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Woods is Jordan's age (37), the documents listing
golf's records will read like a repetitive roll call: Tiger Woods .
. . Tiger Woods . . . Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to win the US Open at Pebble Beach, Calif., but
to win it by 15 strokes is staggering. It's one thing to win the
British Open at St. Andrews in Scotland, but to face a course with
112 bunkers and not be affected by them is amazing. One year, 1997,
you dominate the Masters in Augusta, Ga. Shortly after that you
overhaul your swing, briefly struggle, listen to people talk about
you as if you are some one-hit-and-out child actor, and then pull
2000 out of your pocket as if it were a trump.
</P>
<P>
   There are no weaknesses in Woods's game. His shots off the tee
are accurate projectiles that often travel 350 yards. He's got a
great short game, able to use a pitching wedge from 160 yards
(while some others use 8-irons). His presence has dampened the
silly question, ``Is golf a game or is it a sport?'' Watch him.
It's a sport. Of course.
</P>
<P>
   Woods? The next Jordan? The analogy doesn't fit, especially when
the discussion goes beyond sports. They are both pitchmen for Nike,
the company that tries to put its famous swoosh on your psyche.
They are both handsome, dominant, and rich. But let's examine them
closer.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a cliche to say that Jordan is the best basketball
player to ever live. An addendum to that is that the NBA never saw
the likes of him before. As much as I love Jordan, I can tell you
neither statement is true. Wilt Chamberlain was a more resourceful
scorer; Oscar Robertson and Jerry West could be considered near
equals as guards; Dr. J and Connie Hawkins were in-flight stylists.
The point is that there were elements of Jordan's game that were
seen before he came to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   What no one saw, though, was a man who created such an off-court
phenomenon. They never saw a man who sold ads such as he did,
inspired kids to shave their heads clean as he did, and introduced
a new style of clothing _ socks low, wristband high, shorts baggy _
as he did.
</P>
<P>
   With Woods, no one can argue this point: We've never seen anyone
who looks like him remix golf the way that he is remixing it. Sam
Snead and Jack Nicklaus certainly knew how to win. The late Ben
Hogan, whose father killed himself when Hogan was 9, certainly had
a rougher life (and a similar level of concentration). Arnold
Palmer had his devotees _ although few of them were like the
streakers who showed up at St. Andrews Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But has anyone seen a golfer drive like this?
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Tiger, if you saw someone hit the ball 300 yards you
thought it was impressive,'' John Rieker said Monday. ``But he can
hit it 350. People have never seen anyone hit the ball 350 yards _
with accuracy _ like he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Rieker is the head pro at Franklin Park Golf Course in Boston's
Dorchester neighborhood. The course is located near the
intersection of Blue Hill Avenue and Columbia Road. Step off the
course and walk around the block, and you can see a lot of people
who look like Tiger Woods. More than ever, because of Woods, you
can see more people on the course who look like him, too.
</P>
<P>
   As Woods was winning the British Open Sunday, about 50 people
gathered in the Franklin Park clubhouse and watched the broadcast.
That wouldn't have happened five or 10 years ago, Rieker said. The
camps offered at the course, for children between the ages of 7 and
14, have had attendance double since they began eight years ago.
Attendance reached its peak last year at 600. If you had miked the
area Monday, you would have heard one name.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the topic of discussion here,'' Rieker said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods? The next Jordan? Here's another reason it doesn't fit:
When Woods goes to work, he can practically shake the hand of Jim
Crow. In 1997, he acknowledged that he had been receiving death
threats since he was 16. He once described himself as a mix of
Caucasian, African-American, Indian, and Asian. But, obviously,
when some people see him, they focus on all aspects that are
nonwhite. Woods further challenges the imaginations of some fans
(and raises the ire of others) with his current romantic choice,
still seen as taboo in some areas. His girlfriend is white.
</P>
<P>
   Everything he does seems to stretch and redefine the rules,
whether they be written athletic ones or unspoken social ones. No
one who looks like Woods has ever been this successful in golf, so
no one has ever had to ponder these things while also pondering
course layouts.
</P>
<P>
   If Woods must be compared to another athlete, it should probably
be Bill Russell, not Michael Jordan. In 1957, Russell entered an
NBA that hadn't seen many men of his complexion nor men who had his
vertical skills. He changed an aspect of his sport; Woods is doing
a full-scale remodeling of his.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing aspect of the Woods tale is imagining how
the sport will look when he is gone from it. He has brought an aura
of accessibility and athleticism to a country club sport. This
sport and its crowds will change a decade from now. It will become
younger. And it will become darker. A lot of it will have to do
with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool to be a golfer now,'' Rieker said. ``Kids love
(Woods). When I'm out, people always ask, `How good is he, really?
And what will he do next?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The question is not what (itals)he(unitals) will do next. He'll
be fine. He'll continue to dazzle galleries and titillate home
audiences. A more interesting area is trying to foresee what will
come after him.

FRESH FRUIT PERFECT PIE FILLING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Adds photo information

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>

1 Plentiful summer fruits perfectly complement your favorite
crust. &QL; 
2 Whip up a beautiful fruit pie such as peach this summer with the
lovely array of fresh fruits available at markets in your area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing quite like the glorious taste of a freshly baked
fruit pie. With produce bins overflowing with a rainbow of the
season's fresh fruits  &UR; _ &LR;  from peaches and nectarines to plums and
pears and an array of berries  &UR; _ &LR;  the time is ripe for turning out
some luscious and glorious beauties at home. The possibilities and
combinations are numerous and rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   If making a pie crust eludes you (or you don't have time), don't
give up. Simply skip creating the crust altogether and pick up a
box of refrigerated, rolled-out and folded prepared crusts in the
supermarket deli section  &UR; _ &LR;  they're ready to use on a moment's
notice. It's even feasible to use store-bought phyllo and puff
pastry dough for lining pie pans. And if you want something even
simpler to use the bounty of summer fruits, you might find
cobblers, crisps and crumbles even less intimidating. A range of
recipe choices is included here.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Classic Home Desserts,'' the late Richard Sax writes,
``Many find baking a pie more threatening than preparing any other
dessert. And it's making and rolling out the crust that gets the
Anxiety Devil going.''
</P>
<P>
   It's really not that difficult if you follow a few simple
procedures. The general rule for making good pie crust doughs:
``Handle them as little as possible and keep them cool as you
work,'' writes Sax, to avoid having the fat break down and become
greasy, which results in a leaden crust.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C.-based baking expert Lisa Yockelson, author of
``Country Pies'' (and numerous other baking books), writes, ``When
making pie dough, remember all liquids and fats (even shortening)
should be used cold so your pie crust will bake up tender and
flaky. When working with pie dough, your hands should be cool; if
they are warm, rinse them in cold water before handling the dough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone should learn to make a pie crust by hand to
get the feel of how a dough is actually formed,'' encourages
Yockelson. A food processor allows you to make the dough without
actually touching it except at the end. Be careful to avoid
overmixing or overworking the dough. ``If you're concerned about
overmixing, make the dough by hand.''
</P>
<P>
   While some experts suggest combining butter and solid vegetable
shortening for the most tender, flaky doughs, others prefer using
only butter for best flavor results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I favor butter for flavor,'' says Yockelson, who never uses a
packaged pie crust. ``To me, making a pie crust is like an act of
breathing. I make a pie crust as someone would pour milk into a
glass. It is that natural to me.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's feasible to roll out the dough as soon as the pastry
ingredients are combined, chilling the dough
 &UR; _ &LR;  which gives the gluten a chance to rest and relax a bit
 &UR; _ &LR;  makes it more tender and prevents it from contracting during
baking.
</P>
<P>
   The trick to rolling out the dough is to push outward from the
center  &UR; _ &LR;  not back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   You can refrigerate the prepared pie dough three days or freeze
it up to three months.
</P>
<P>
   To save time, Yockelson keeps 10-inch rounds of rolled-out
pastry dough (which she freezes on a baking sheet between two
sheets of waxed paper until firm and then wraps well and stores in
a plastic pie carrier) stashed in the freezer. Transfer from the
freezer to the fridge to slowly thaw overnight.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to thickeners  &UR; _ &LR;  which give the juice of the
fruits body and sheen  &UR; _ &LR;  some baking experts avoid flour because
it turns the fruit juices gummy and cloudy. Food writer John Thorne
of the Simple Cooking newsletter is adamant that fruit fillings
should never be thickened with flour.
</P>
<P>
   Yockelson says she selects the thickener for her fruit pies
based on the type of fruit being used. She sometimes uses flour
with good results. ''I've never seen it as a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   However, many bakers recommend using cornstarch, quick-cooking
tapioca, arrowroot or potato starch.
</P>
<P>
   Sax thickens his fruit creations with cornstarch, using about
three tablespoons per five to six cups of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   But the amount of thickener necessary depends on the fruit and
how juicy it is. It's best to use a tested recipe as a guideline so
you don't end up with juices flowing out of control. Also keep in
mind that the riper the fruit, the lower its pectin level, so you
may want to add more thickener if your fruit is very ripe.
</P>
<P>
   You can judge the juiciness of the fruit by how much juice is at
the bottom of the bowl a few minutes after you mix in the thickener
combined with sugar, points out Yockelson. If you have very juicy
fruit  &UR; _ &LR;  like peaches  &UR; _ &LR;  you'll see a lot of juice at the bottom
and may need to adjust the amount of thickener.
</P>
<P>
   Yockelson  &UR; _ &LR;  whose first consideration is one of taste and gel
 &UR; _ &LR;  uses flour (which she refers to as an old-time, readily
available thickener) with some acidic fruits like sour cherries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sour cherry pie (you end up with) is not that cloudy. It
doesn't have the vivid (color) tone of a pie made with cornstarch,
but I like the mouth feel of the flour thickener
 &UR; _ &LR;  and it condenses the juices of the pie and cuts well.''
</P>
<P>
   But other times  &UR; _ &LR;  in apple and deep-dish peach pies, for
instance  &UR; _ &LR;  she opts for cornstarch, which binds well and has a
lighter feeling to it. She avoids quick-cooking tapioca as she
doesn't like the little pellets you end up with in the pie  &UR; _ &LR;  and
even if the tapioca is pulverized in the food processor before
using, she has found the results less than satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   A lattice-top fresh peach pie article in the July/August issue
of Cook's Illustrated touts using potato starch as a thickener.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potato starch scored big: its clarity outshone flour but
was less cosmetically glossy than cornstarch; its thickening
qualities rivaled tapioca in their strength and neutrality; and
still better there was no need for pulverizing.'' The article also
noted that if potato starch isn't available, an equal amount of
pulverized Minute tapioca can be substituted.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever thickener you decide to use, remember that flour and
cornstarch can't be used interchangeably in terms of amounts. One
tablespoon of cornstarch is the equivalent of two tablespoons
all-purpose flour.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to whip up something that takes less time and energy
than a fruit pie, try cobblers, crisps or crumbles. In a cobbler,
the fruit is covered with biscuit dough  &UR; _ &LR;  either rolled out or
dropped  &UR; _ &LR;  and then baked until golden. In crisps, you avoid dough
altogether, topping instead with a mixture of butter, sugar, flour
and sometimes nuts and then baking. Cookie crumbs, graham cracker
crumbs and buttered bread crumbs can also be used. In a crumble,
the fruit is topped with a mixture of butter, brown sugar, flour
and oats and then baked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cobblers have been my standard casual company dessert for
years,'' writes author Pam Anderson in her ``The Perfect Recipe''
cookbook. ``Enriched with whipped cream or ice cream, they taste as
good as a fruit pie and can be assembled much more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice is yours. Showcase this season's ripe, juicy fresh
fruits in some of these delectable ways. &QL;

   &UR; WILD ABOUT HARRY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By STEPHEN KING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
</P>
<P>
   I read the first novel in the Harry Potter series, ``Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' in April 1999 and was only
moderately impressed. But in April 1999 I was pretty much all
right. Two months later I was involved in a serious road accident
that necessitated a long and painful period of recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   During the early part of this period I read Potters 2 and 3
(``Chamber of Secrets,'' ``Prisoner of Azkaban'') and found myself
a lot more than moderately wowed. In the miserably hot summer of
'99, the Harry Potters (and the superb detective novels of Dennis
Lehane) became a kind of lifeline for me.
</P>
<P>
   During July and August I found myself getting through my
unpleasant days by aiming my expectations at evening, when I would
drag my hardware-encumbered leg into the kitchen, eat fresh fruit
and ice cream and read about Harry Potter's adventures at Hogwarts,
a school for young wizards (motto: ``Never tickle a sleeping
dragon'').
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, I awaited this summer's installment in J.K.
Rowling's magical saga with almost as much interest as any
Potter-besotted kid. I had enjoyed the first three, but had read
the latter two while taking enough painkillers to levitate a horse.
This summer, that's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   I'm relieved to report that Potter 4 _ ``Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire'' _ is every bit as good as Potters 1 through 3.
It's longer, though. ``Goblet'' is as long as ``Chamber'' and
``Prisoner'' combined.
</P>
<P>
   Is it more textured than the first three? More
thought-provoking? Sorry, no. Are such things necessary in a
fantasy-adventure aimed primarily at children and published in the
lush green heart of summer vacation? Of course not. What kids on
summer vacation want _ and probably deserve _ is simple,
uncomplicated fun. ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' brings
the fun, and not just in stingy little buckets. At 734 pages,
``Goblet'' brings it by the lorry load.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable thing about this book is that Rowling's
punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor goes the distance. At
700-plus pages, one should eventually tire of Blast-Ended Skrewts,
Swedish Short-Snout dragons and devices like the Quick-Quotes Quill
(a kind of magical tape recorder employed by the satisfyingly
repugnant Daily Prophet reporter Rita Skeeter), but one never does.
At the least this reader did not.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because Rowling doesn't dwell for long on such
amusing inventions as the Quill, which floats in midair and bursts
out with florid bits of tabloid prose at odd moments. She gives the
reader a quick wink and a giggle before hustling him or her along
again, all the while telling her tale at top speed. We go with this
willingly enough, smiling bemusedly and waiting for the next nudge,
wink and raised eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   Puns and giggles aside, the story happens to be a good one. We
may be a little tired of discovering Harry at home with his
horrible aunt and uncle (plus his even more horrible cousin,
Dudley, whose favorite PlayStation game is Mega-Mutilation Part 3),
but once Harry has attended the obligatory Quidditch match and
returned to Hogwarts, the tale picks up speed.
</P>
<P>
   In a Newsweek interview with Malcolm Jones, Rowling admitted to
reading Tolkien rather late in the game, but it's hard to believe
she hasn't read her Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. Although
they bear the trappings of fantasy, and the mingling of the real
world and the world of wizards and flying broomsticks is
delightful, the Harry Potter books are, at heart, satisfyingly
shrewd mystery tales.
</P>
<P>
   Potter 3 (``Azkaban'') dealt with Harry's parents (like all good
boy heroes, Harry's an orphan) and cleared up the multiple
mysteries of their deaths in a way that would likely have pleased
Ross Macdonald, that longtime creator of hidden pasts and
convoluted family trees.
</P>
<P>
   Now, returning to Hogwarts after attending the Quidditch World
Cup, Harry and his friends are excited to learn that the Triwizard
Tournament is to be reintroduced after a hiatus of 100 years or so
(too many of the young contestants wound up dead, it seems).
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring wizards from two other schools (Beauxbatons and the
amusingly fascistic Durmstrang Academy, location unknown) have been
invited to spend the year at Hogwarts and compete in the contest,
which is composed of three beautifully imagined tasks. These can
only be performed well by contestants who can solve the riddles
that bear on them; both children and students of Greek mythology
will enjoy this aspect of Rowling's tale.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Sorting Hat, one of Rowling's early ingenious bits of
invention, the Goblet of Fire is essentially a choosing device.
It's supposed to spit out three flaming bits of parchment bearing
the names of the three contestants in the tournament, one entrant
from each school. In a vivid and marvelously tense scene, the
Goblet of Fire spits out four parchment fragments instead of three.
The fourth, of course, bears the name of Our Hero.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harry is supposedly too young to compete in such a
dangerous series of tilts, the Goblet has spoken, and of course
Harry must step into the arena. If you think young readers won't
lap this up, you never had one in your house (or were one
yourself).
</P>
<P>
   Adults are apt to be more interested in just how Harry's name
got into the Goblet in the first place. This is a mystery Rowling
works out with snap and verve. And, unlike the denouements I
remember from the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys mysteries of my youth,
where the culprit usually turned out to be some vile tramp of the
lower classes, the solution to the Goblet mystery, like the answers
to the Triwizard riddles, struck me as fair enough.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Rowling gives us Harry's first date (not with the
alluring fifth-level dream girl Cho Chang, unfortunately), at least
one thought-provoking subplot (involving house-elves who rather
enjoy their status as kitchen slaves) and an extremely large dose
of adolescent humor (one mildly off-color joke, punning on the word
Uranus, will likely go over the heads of most grade-school readers
and amuse the brighter junior high school set). There's also a
moderately tiresome amount of adolescent squabbling. Adults can
safely speed through these bits; it's a teen-age thing.
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone wonder at the fabulous sales success of these books?
The Harry Potter series is a supernatural version of ``Tom Brown's
Schooldays,'' updated and given a hip this-is-how-kids-really-are
shine. And Harry is the kid most children feel themselves to be,
adrift in a world of unimaginative and often unpleasant adults _
Muggles, Rowling calls them _ who neither understand them nor care
to. Harry is, in fact, a male Cinderella, waiting for someone to
invite him to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In Potter 1, his invitation comes first by owl (in the magic
world of J.K. Rowling, owls deliver the mail) and then by Sorting
Hat; in the current volume it comes from the Goblet of Fire,
smoldering and shedding glamorous sparks. How nice to be invited to
the ball! Even for a relatively old codger like me, it's still nice
to be invited to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   It would be depressing to announce that the best-selling book in
the history of the world, a position this book will probably hold
only until Potter 5 comes along, is a stinker. ``Goblet of Fire''
is far from that.
</P>
<P>
   Before Harry appeared on the scene, escape-hungry kids had to
make do with R.L. Stine, the uninspired but wildly successful
journeyman who inspired the ``Goosebumps'' phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling's books are better natured, better plotted and better
written. They bulge with the sort of playful details of which only
British fantasists seem capable: there's the Whomping Willow, which
will smash hell out of your car (and you) if you get too close to
it, snack foods like Cauldron Cakes and Licorice Wands and the
satisfyingly evil Lord Voldemort (so evil, in fact, that most of
Rowling's characters will only call him ``You-know-who'').
</P>
<P>
   The Dursleys, Harry's unpleasant guardians, explain the boy's
long absences by telling their friends that Harry attends St.
Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. And the book
opens with the murder (offstage, don't worry) of a witch named
Bertha Jorkins. Rowling doesn't exactly come out and say it's what
the unfortunate Bertha deserves for taking her vacation in Albania,
but she certainly implies it.
</P>
<P>
   Is there more going on here than fun? Again, not much. In a good
deal of British fantasy fiction, the amusing inventions are
balanced by themes of increasing darkness _ Tolkien's ``Rings''
trilogy, for instance, in which the fascism of Mordor begins as a
distant bad smell on the breeze and develops into a pervasive
atmosphere of dread, or the Narnia books of C.S. Lewis, in which
the writer's religious concerns invest what begin as harmless
make-believe adventures with a significance that becomes, in the
end, almost unbearable (and to this reader, rather tiresome).
</P>
<P>
   Taken to its extreme, the id of British fantasy produces a
Richard Adams, where the unfortunate talking dogs Snitter and Rowf
suffer almost unspeakable hardships and the bear-god Shardik comes
to stand for all the promises religion ever made and then broke;
where every sunlit field of scampering rabbits conceals its shining
wire of death.
</P>
<P>
   In Rowling's work, such shadows can be perceived, but they are
thin shadows, quickly dispelled. Harry's adventures remain for the
most part upbeat and sunny, despite the occasional cold pockets of
gruel; more Lewis Carroll than George Orwell.
</P>
<P>
   The British fantasy they may actually be closest to is J.M.
Barrie's ``Peter Pan.'' Like any school, where the clientele is
perpetually young and even the teachers begin to assume the
immature psychological char acteristics of their pupils, Hogwarts
is a kind of Never-Never Land. Yet Harry and his friends show some
reassuring signs of growing up eventually. In the current volume
there is some discreet necking, and at least a few sorrows and
disappointments that need coping with.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy writer's job is to conduct the willing reader from
mundanity to magic. This is a feat of which only a superior
imagination is capable, and Rowling possesses such equipment. She
has said repeatedly that the Potter novels are not consciously
aimed at any particular audience or age. The reader may reasonably
question that assertion after reading the first book in the series,
but by the time he or she has reached ``Harry Potter and the Goblet
of Fire,'' it becomes increasingly clear that the lady means what
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can there be any question that her stated refusal to dumb
down the language of the books (the current one is presented with
such British terms as petrol, pub and cuppa unchanged) has lent the
stories an attraction to adults that most children's novels simply
don't have.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news is good. Harry Potter will soon be appearing at
a multiplex near you. The initial project is being helmed by Chris
Columbus, a filmmaker of no demonstrable ingenuity; one doubts if
the director of ``The Goonies,'' one of the loudest, dumbest and
most shriekingly annoying children's movies ever made, is up to
bringing Rowling's scatty wit and vibrant imagination to the
screen. (I hope, on behalf of the millions of children who love
Harry, Hermione and Ron Weasley, that Columbus will prove me
wrong.)
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy, even that as sturdy and uncomplicated as this Young
Wizard's Progress, is difficult to bring to film, where the wonders
are all too often apt to shrink and become banal. Perhaps Harry
Potter's place is in the imaginations of his readers. And if these
millions of readers are awakened to the wonders and rewards of
fantasy at 11 or 12 ... well, when they get to age 16 or so,
there's this guy named King.
</P>
<P>
   (Stephen King's ``On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft'' is coming
out this fall.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even now, she'll ask herself whether it was chance or fate four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times I wonder, `Why did Atlanta happen?' ' Kerri
Strug says. `` `Why was it me? What am I supposed to do with this
role that came my way?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It just happened that Strug was the last US gymnast up on the
last event of the Olympic team competition. It just happened that
the gold medal was on the line. It just happened that Strug tore up
her left ankle on her first vault. It just happened that the ankle
was good enough that she could try again, bad enough that she
couldn't walk afterward. Everything just happened.
</P>
<P>
   In the few seconds it took Strug to sprint-limp down a runway
inside the Georgia Dome on that night in July, her life changed
utterly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flying high,'' Strug recalls. ``It was surreal, really
incredible. Initially I thought, `OK, it'll be this way for two
weeks.' Then it was, `OK, a year.' If anyone had said four years
ago that things would still be transpiring the way they are, I
would have thought they were crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Magnificent Seven who won the team gold in 1996, only
Strug and Amanda Borden won't be at this week's national
championships in St. Louis, trying for another shot at Olympus. But
even though Strug has retired from competition, even though she's
about to graduate from college, even though a new generation of
Vanessas and Alyssas has taken the floor, it goes on. The
interviews. The speeches. The clinics. The celebrity benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Troy Aikman and I was so ecstatic,'' Strug says. ``Then
he said on his AOL site that he got to meet Kerri Strug and I was,
`Oh my gosh, he knows who I am and he remembers me!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Strug, like Mike Eruzione and Brandi Chastain, is on an eternal
video loop, immortalized for one glorious sporting moment. Eruzione
will always be dancing in the corner of the rink at Lake Placid
with the Soviet goalie on his knees. Chastain will always be
screaming in her sports bra on the floor of the Rose Bowl. Strug
will always be in coach Bela Karolyi's arms on the medal stand, her
ankle wrapped and bulging like a Christmas package.
</P>
<P>
   She accepts that now, even if she doesn't quite understand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's going to be the defining moment of my life,''
Strug says. ``But I don't want it to be The Moment. Maybe this was
my one chance to make a worldly impact and the rest of the things
that I do won't. But that doesn't mean that having a family or
graduating with a master's from Stanford isn't going to be just as
satisfying as the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to top The Moment, which is one reason Strug has
no desire for a reprise in Sydney this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, `Why aren't you going for Sydney?' '' she says.
``They don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Strug is 22 now and she hasn't trained seriously for three
years. To get back to world-class shape, she would have to starve
herself and live in the gym for eight hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get older, you're defying the odds,'' Strug says.
``You can't stay on top forever in a sport like gymnastics. The
young ones have more energy, they're lighter, they're swifter. And
they don't know there's another world out there because they
haven't experienced it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was always going to be her finish line, and Strug
wouldn't even have been there if she hadn't barely missed making
the all-around final in 1992. She already had a team bronze from
Barcelona. What she wanted in Atlanta was an individual medal. When
she realized that her ruined ankle dashed her chances, Strug was
devastated. She never dreamed that the ankle would make her rich
and famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a gymnast, you're never thinking about those
things,'' says Strug. ``At least, I wasn't. Sure, in the back of
your mind you always think it'd be nice if you get some
recognition. But if that's why you're doing it, you're doing it
backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Strug didn't know that she was vaulting for the gold medal. She
had no idea what the score was. And she couldn't have known that
her second vault wouldn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians still had two competitors left on floor exercise
and they usually save the best for last,'' says Strug. ``There was
a lot of controversy in the media afterwards. `Why did she do it?
She didn't have to.' But we didn't know that at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Strug would have done the second vault anyway because she had
botched the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't have fallen on the first one,'' she says. ``That's
how I viewed it. The last thing you want to do is end your Olympic
career on a fall. That's awful. If I didn't do it, I always would
have said, `What if . . .?' I think anyone would have. Even if I'd
gone for it and not made it, it would have been better than walking
away.''
</P>
<P>
   And Strug still would have done the vault on a bad ankle because
gymnasts _ especially Karolyi's gymnasts _ are trained to perform
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely felt a little worse than usual but I thought,
`Oh, it's just another one of those things _ go!' '' says Strug,
who had torn both the medial and lateral ligaments. ``I'm lucky
that I didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   So she landed the vault and the Americans won the gold for the
first time and suddenly Strug was the gritty heroine who'd risked
crippling herself for her team and her country. It wasn't Shannon
Miller or Dominique Moceanu, who'd gotten marquee billing before
the Games. It was the doctor's daughter from Tucson with the chirpy
voice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strug made more than a million dollars during the next year. She
wrote two books (``Heart of Gold'' and ``Landing On My Feet''). She
went to the president's 50th birthday party. She met Mikhail
Gorbachev. She bantered with Rosie O'Donnell. She spoofed herself
on ``Saturday Night Live.'' Amazing, she marveled. All because of
one vault.
</P>
<P>
   It was inevitable, Strug says, that there would be ruffled
feathers among her teammates, especially when Strug didn't join
them on the sanctioned post-Olympic tour and did a rival weekend
tour. Hadn't they won the gold medal together?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of hurtful, to be honest, because these were girls
I thought were like my sisters,'' says Strug. ``Yes, we were very
competitive and we didn't always love each other. But you do care,
you do relate. By no means have I ever thought I was different from
the team. It just so happened that the cards were dealt that way
for me that time. But of course you're going to think: `We all won
the gold medal. Why does she get to do this, why does she get to do
that?' It's just human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   If Strug weren't due to enroll at UCLA, she says, she would have
joined the other six on tour (which she did, a year later).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not to say that I didn't want to be with them,'' she
says. ``But I wasn't going to alter another whole year of my life
just to go touring. Because I'd already altered so many things.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympus, then college, was always the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew that Atlanta was going to be it for me,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   She had already taken a year out of school. It was time, her
parents said, to do what most normal 18-year-olds do.
</P>
<P>
   Strug, who had been living in a gym since she was 5, had no idea
what normal was.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're coming from a different world,'' she says. ``You
realize, oh my goodness, there are boys. Pizza does taste good.
It's fun to go to the movies. Going on a date, going to a college
football game _ to everyone else, that's nothing. But when you're
19 and you haven't done it yet, it's a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Decisions were easy in the gymnastics world because there were
so few to be made. At UCLA, Strug found herself with a bewildering
array of choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even deciding what to eat, that was a big deal,'' she says.
``While you're going through it, you don't like Bela telling you
everything to do, you don't like having that dictator. But once
it's taken away, it can be very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strug eventually found UCLA and Los Angeles overwhelming, so
after her sophomore year she transferred to Stanford, a.k.a. The
Farm, where celebrity students (like Chelsea Clinton) are taken in
stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `She won a gold medal. Well, I started my own
dot.com, I'm a millionaire. So what?' '' Strug says.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford, the expectations on her are mostly self-inflicted.
Once a gold medalist, always a gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll think, well, I have to be top of the class,'' says Strug,
an A student who is two classes short of her undergraduate degree
and will be staying at Palo Alto to get a master's in
organizational structures. ``No, I don't. But it was part of being
a perfectionist, being afraid of failure. I'd be afraid to take a
biology class because it was going to mess up my GPA. But I like
biology, so why not take the class? If you have one class where you
don't have an A, you're going to be OK. But it takes doing poorly
to realize that life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   One poor vault on one night changed her life forever. Had it
been perfect, Strug might just have been the face between Moceanu
and Miller in the team photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a wonderful four years and I've loved every
opportunity,'' she says. ``That's not to say that every morning I
wake up happy to challenge the day, but more so than not. The pros
definitely outweigh the cons.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times, Strug says, when she misses the adrenaline rush
she used to get as a gymnast _ ``that feeling of being nervous but
knowing that you're going to do awesome.'' She misses the
satisfying simplicity of doing one thing extraordinarily well. And
she misses the playground camaraderie of the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite as much fun going to the library for six
hours,'' she says, ``as it was flying around in the air for six
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Her flying days have been over for a while now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw online that I was coming back,'' she says. ``I said,
really? That's news to me.''
</P>
<P>
   She moved on when it was time to move on and she has left the
floor to those who eat not of pizza. ``I think, well, in Sydney
there'll be some new little star and in 2004 there'll be another
one,'' Kerri Strug says. ``But I guess nobody can take away from me
or the girls what we did in Atlanta.''

GIANT PRACTICE CASUALTY OF PATRIOT INJURIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Max Lane walked out of the cafeteria at
Bryant College sporting a wrap all the way up his right leg; he did
not participate in the afternoon practice. Ditto for Ryan Tujague,
a free agent rookie out of Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Both players were added to a staggering list of New England
offensive linemen who have gone down with injuries at training
camp. The situation is so bad that coach Bill Belichick Monday
called New York Giants coach Jim Fassel to cancel their joint
practice at the University of Massachusetts that was to have taken
place Thursday from 12-2 p.m. The reason, according to Patriots
spokesman Stacey James, was ``a lack of depth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who train in Albany, N.Y., were going to meet the
Patriots at McGuirk Stadium in Amherst, which is about midway
between the teams' camps.
</P>
<P>
   The scary thing is that the Patriots may not be in appreciably
better shape by the time they take the field for their first
exhibition contest _ Monday's Hall of Fame Game against the San
Francisco 49ers in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The linemen who are missing practice because of injuries or
surgery aftereffects are second-round pick Adrian Klemm, right
guard Todd Rucci, left tackle/guard Lane, guard/center Lance Scott,
left tackle Bruce Armstrong, right tackle Grant Williams, and
Tujague. Those who remain standing include center Damien Woody
(though he got up gingerly after going down in the morning
practice), guard Derrick Fletcher, rookie free agent guard Adam
Davis, rookie tackle Greg Robinson-Randall, guard/center Jason
Andersen (who was playing left tackle before the morning practice
was over), and free agents Brent Warren and Terrance Beadles.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has been slow to recover from knee surgery but seemed
to be picking up his intensity in personal drills and may be forced
to suit up long before he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also have taken a hit on their defensive line with
Henry Thomas going down with arthroscopic knee surgery, while
Brandon Mitchell is nursing a calf injury. Linebacker Ted Johnson
and Chad Cascadden have been nursing injuries all week.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the Patriots are a mess.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation of Thursday's scrimmage at least removes the
risk of injury to Drew Bledsoe, who would have been protected by a
makeshift offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   It is tough to judge offensive linemen until they play in games,
so who knows whether Robinson-Randall, a fourth-round pick out of
Michigan State, and Davis, out of Oklahoma State, can provide
adequate protection for Bledsoe's right side? Who knows whether
second-year man Fletcher, a 6-6, 350-pound mass of humanity, can
prevent Bledsoe from seeing major time on the turf Monday?
</P>
<P>
   Is this the way the Patriots really want to find out?
</P>
<P>
   Belichick and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis understand the
situation, so they say the right things: They'll hope for the best,
and hope to give young quarterbacks Michael Bishop and Tom Brady
most of the snaps. Bledsoe probably has to show up and play a
series or two because the game is on national television, but you
can bet the house that he will be handing off a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Drew about it before the start of training camp,''
said Belichick. ``With the extra preseason game, what I'd like to
do is get the two younger QBs the opportunity and then evaluate
them after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll talk to Drew about that. We haven't decided if this guy
will play 10 plays or that guy will play 15. My plan is to play
Brady and Bishop more than Drew and John (Friesz) the first two
games.''
</P>
<P>
   What if one of the 49ers' experienced linemen eats up a young
Patriot and imperils Bledsoe?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you play a preseason game, you have to manage the
game, whether it be the first quarter or fourth quarter,'' said
Belichick. ``You have to understand who you're putting on the field
and what they're capable of doing. When you're playing 70-80
people, you can't play them all the same. There's a certain level
for each player. Then you look at what the other team has out
there. We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where you're
overmatched.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has said from the start of camp that he doesn't have
an opinion about having to play so early in the preseason. Nor has
he said there's any disadvantage or advantage to playing five
exhibition games as opposed to four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll play what's in front of us,'' said Belichick. ``I have
no control over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more frustrating is that the roster is at its limit, so to
add players, he would have to drop some.
</P>
<P>
   There also is concern about players being overworked in
two-a-day sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to manage that,'' said Belichick. ``We don't want to
run down the guys we have. Sometimes there's an imbalance if you
only have, for instance, a few defensive backs and a lot of
receivers. I think we're OK. We can do what we need to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen. Everytime an offensive lineman gets
nicked, there's a hush from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Playing an early game doesn't help, though it could give young
players a chance to get some valuable experience.
</P>
<P>
   With a new coach and a new system, the Patriots have not had a
lot of time to practice all of the new things. Suffice to say there
will be some rust and awkward moments Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Right now there can be no real competition on the offensive
line. It's just football's version of ``Survivor,'' and the big
question is, will Drew Bledsoe survive in the end?

   BUSH-LOYALTY (Washington) _ With the selection of Dick Cheney as
his running mate, Republican George W. Bush has underscored the

MARK BLOUNT WISE TO HIS WAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The ``Wisdom Tour'' started the moment Mark Blount
declared himself eligible for the NBA draft, leaving the University
of Pittsburgh in 1997 after his sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-10-inch center gave his brief NBA stint and sojourns
to the CBA, IBL, and USBL the title ``Wisdom Tour'' after realizing
how little he knew about the world of professional basketball.
Since the tour kicked off, Blount has made stops in Seattle,
Atlantic City, Los Angeles, Sioux Falls, S.D., and Baltimore. With
serious interest being shown by the Celtics, he has booked an
extended stay in Boston, beginning with training camp and, he
hopes, continuing through the season.
</P>
<P>
   If Blount can make it through the first two weeks of camp _ and
there's no reason to expect he won't _ he will make the team.
According to Celtics director of player personnel Leo Papile,
Blount has a ``99 percent'' chance of making the squad. Papile
considers Blount a bonus draft pick and compares the starting
center for the Celtics' entry in the Shaw's Pro Summer League very
favorably with the big men selected in 2000. Papile also foresees
Blount getting minutes, not just pushing his teammates in practice.
</P>
<P>
   But the experience gained through the minor leagues and the
major disappointment of not sticking with an NBA team (despite
short stays with the Sonics and Clippers) out of college kept
Blount from celebrating. His biggest lesson has been that a
professional basketball career ``is a long journey the whole way
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount does not regret leaving Pittsburgh, though some
basketball pundits believe early struggles attached a stigma to
him. By some accounts, Blount became a cautionary tale for
early-entry candidates and NBA teams steered away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt he made a major mistake coming out of school,'' said
Kevin Mackey, who coached Blount in the USBL. ``He was just
learning how to play the game. There's a different clock on a
(6-10) guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Papile likened Blount to a basketball leper. As an unwritten
rule, teams sometimes don't want to touch a player who makes a
mistake by leaving school before he's mentally and physically
ready.
</P>
<P>
   Banished to the minor leagues without playing a regulation NBA
game and with the word ``potential'' at the top of his resume,
Blount remade himself and matured.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the period of time (after the draft), I had to work on
myself,'' said Blount, 24. ``I slowed myself down and said, `Hey,
now you're a man. You're supposed to be working. You're supposed to
take care of yourself.' After the draft, it was like a whole new
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that I could play in (the NBA) and have a statement in
this game. I had done this and that. But I knew it was time to get
where I wanted to be and do what I wanted to do. I think I've done
a great job over the past two or three years getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   A bigger, stronger, wiser Blount is on display at UMass-Boston's
Clark Athletic Center. Through commitment to a weight-lifting
program, Blount has gained 15 pounds since college, allowing him to
bang his 220 pounds around. Among his summer league peers, his
shot-blocking skills stand out. Although 2.3 blocks per contest is
not an overwhelming number, it's the manner in which Blount
collects blocks that impresses.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter against Philadelphia Thursday, Blount
anticipated a pass and tipped it away. He could not complete the
steal, but hustled back toward the basket and managed to block the
shot. Monday, in the league finale, Blount scored 17 points,
recorded three blocked shots and had eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, Blount averaged 10.3 points in eight games.
Apparently, the Celtics have found a big man who not only has solid
skills at both ends of the court, but also genuinely enjoys playing
in the team's system with an emphasis on defense.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of summer league play, Blount plans to rest for a
few days at home in St. Augustine, Fla., and then continue to
refine his game for training camp. Although excited about his
prospects with Boston, Blount does not want to get overly excited.
He has not talked with his family about the future and the positive
feedback he has received from the Celtics, preferring to focus on
the hard work ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The levelheaded outlook comes from the ``Wisdom Tour.'' It was
on the road in the CBA, IBL, and USBL that Blount learned he had to
put his ``wild and partying high school and college days'' behind.
(He attended three high schools, disuading such college suitors as
UMass with his inability to stay in one place.) Along with his
basketball skills, Blount now practices patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's finalized, I'll call my family,'' said Blount.
``Right now, I've got work to do. I don't think there's going to be
any celebrating. If you want to be the best you can be, what are
you celebrating about until it's all over? You don't celebrate
until you hang up the shoes.''

&HT;     TRADING IT ALL FOR A HAND-BUILT PANOZ 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Fred and Sherry Smith really weren't looking to
buy another new car.
</P>
<P>
   They had a 2001 Toyota MR2 Spyder, just eight days old, not even
broken in yet. And of course, there was the red '99 Plymouth
Prowler, one of those $40,000-plus retro-looking street rods that
they bought a year or so ago.
</P>
<P>
   But while they were out driving around one recent Saturday
afternoon, the Smiths, who live in Boerne, Texas, happened upon the
Hovey Motorcars lot in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Smith saw the brand-new, silver Panoz 10th anniversary
special edition Roadster, and as Fred Smith tells it, ``It was love
at first sight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil didn't make me do this; it was Sherry,'' he says of
his on-the-spur-of-the-moment decision to buy the $80,000,
supercharged, hand-built, all-American sports car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yeah, I liked it, too,'' he admits. ``But it was her
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right! Fred also admits that he hasn't let Sherry drive it
yet, adding: ``She has a heavy foot.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two did take the car home that Saturday afternoon, and
no cash changed hands. They traded:
</P>
<P>
   The Prowler.
</P>
<P>
   The MR2.
</P>
<P>
   A trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Three Korean War-vintage military trucks.
</P>
<P>
   And an old tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Their reaction to the Panoz is typical of people who see it: If
they are truly car people, they want it, says Rick Hovey, one of
the dealership's owners (along with his dad, Rich, and brother,
Todd).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Panoz Roadster is a unique automobile, and it turns heads
wherever it goes,'' he said. ``We've been the exclusive San Antonio
dealer for over a year now, and the cars have been a great draw for
us -- even if the people they brought in didn't end up buying one
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The question Rick Hovey gets the most is: ``What is a Panoz?''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of answering, Hovey hands them his business card, which
opens up to reveal two full-color photos of Panoz cars: the
Roadster, a hot-rod-looking car that has been in production in some
form for the past 10 years, and the new Esperante, a more
traditional sports car, which goes on sale later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The cars are hand-built in Hoschton, Ga., by Panoz Automotive
Development, founded in 1990 by Danny Panoz _ son of Don Panoz, who
developed the Nicoderm nicotine ``patch'' and earned a fortune with
it. The family also owns a motorsports company, which competes in
several racing series, and the Road Atlanta race track, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Panoz Auto Development was born of Danny Panoz's desire to build
an American sports car. He bought the manufacturing rights for an
Irish company's chassis designed by engineer Frank Costin, well
known for his work with Lotus, Lister and Maserati.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1989, using Costin's chassis as a philosophical
starting point, Danny and two former engineers of the Irish company
began work in their new shops 50 miles northeast of Atlanta _ a
converted 2,000-square-foot state salt storage shed, according to
the company's published history. Panoz Auto has since grown to fill
five buildings covering 100,000 square feet of floor space.
</P>
<P>
   The first handcrafted Panoz Roadster was introduced just seven
months later, on June 27, 1990, the company says. It was equipped
with a 5.0-liter pushrod Ford V-8 engine, had an all-new
stainless-steel tube space frame, and was the first production car
in the United States to use a superplastic formed aluminum body.
Superplastic forming was developed to make durable parts for the
aerospace and aviation industries, the Panoz history says.
</P>
<P>
   After some improvements to the Roadster, Panoz in 1996 became
the first U.S. manufacturer to design and build a production
``aluminum intensive vehicle,'' as Panoz calls the Roadster.
</P>
<P>
   The original steel space frame was replaced with a twin-tiered
extruded aluminum chassis, and the pushrod cast-iron V-8 engine was
dropped in favor of an all-aluminum, 305-horsepower, 32-valve V-8
built by Ford's Special Vehicle Team and also used in the Ford
Mustang SVT Cobra. This was the new A.I.V. Roadster, whose special
edition would end up in Fred and Sherry Smith's garage.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1996, Danny Panoz and his father launched Panoz Motor
Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both knew that racing was the way to develop new
technologies and create a heritage for the company, so it was
important that the same front/mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout
built for the street was reflected on the track,'' the company
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing guru Adrian Reynard was tapped to help build and enter
two front/mid-engine, rear-wheel drive Esperante GTR-1 cars in the
1997 24 Hours of Le Mans,'' the company says. ``With no racing
experience, Panoz went head to head with the top guns of Porsche,
Mercedes and Ferrari. After 18 hours of racing, Panoz was running
ninth overall when an oil failure knocked it out of contention.
Though neither of the two Panoz cars finished, it was one of the
most impressive showings by an independent manufacturer in the
history of Le Mans.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that start at Le Mans in 1997 and in the American Le Mans
Series, founded by Don Panoz, the Panoz team has finished Le Mans
twice in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   At Hovey Motorcars, there is a bright yellow Panoz Roaster on
display _ not one of the silver anniversary editions (only 10 of
those were built, and none are left), but one of the standard
models with the 4.6-liter Ford SVT engine (not supercharged).
Sticker price is $64,185, but no more of this particular style will
be built; it is being redesigned for 2001 to reflect new smog rules
that are forcing the car's exterior styling to change to
accommodate a new fuel-tank placement, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The Roadster looks a lot like the Prowler, but the Panoz design
has been around a lot longer. The similarities between the two cars
end with the exterior appearance, however, Hovey says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is the performance,'' he said. ``The Panoz
Roadster out-handles the Dodge Viper, out-accelerates the Porsche
911, and leaves the Prowler _ which has only a V-6 engine _ sitting
in its dust.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith agrees with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prowler was a boulevard cruiser,'' he said. ``It just
didn't have the get-up-and-go and the handling of the Panoz. And
the Panoz's craftsmanship is much better than the Prowler's, even
though the Prowler's is very good.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason he traded the Prowler was that he ``hated always
getting beat at the traffic lights'' in the relatively slow
Prowler, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The regular Roadster has a 305-horsepower engine and goes from
zero to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, compared with 253 horsepower and
acceleration from zero to 60 mph of about 7 seconds for the
Prowler. Top speed for the Panoz is about 132 mph; it is limited
because of aerodynamic problems, but if the car would stay on the
ground, it probably could do more than 170 mph, Hovey said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's supercharged Roadster has even more impressive
performance: It has 322 horsepower, and gets to 60 mph in under 4
seconds. It completes the quarter-mile in under 12 seconds. The
aerodynamic problem keeps the top speed down, even though the
speedometer goes to 160 mph, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that if you took those front fenders off, it could
go much faster,'' Smith said. The fenders act like wings on the
2,595-pound car and create lift, taking the front wheels off the
ground if the car is driven too fast.
</P>
<P>
   The more practical Panoz Esperante, which is designed for daily
drives if the owner so chooses, will list for nearly $80,000. The
car was unveiled at the New York Auto Show in April, and the
company says it already has more than 215 deposits for the first
year's production run _ representing about two-thirds of the
plant's capacity for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Panoz also builds track-ready race cars, one of which is on
display at Hovey Motorcars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably going to race it, but for now, it's just for
display,'' Rick Hovey said. ``It isn't street legal; it doesn't
have a title, and their aren't even any headlights on it.''
</P>
<P>

&HT;     NEITHER PICKUP NOR SUV, FORD SUPERCREW OFFERS BITS OF BOTH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The all-new 2001 Ford F-150 SuperCrew seems to be misnamed.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac is the one that is
misnamed.
</P>
<P>
   These two vehicles are identical in concept, yet one is held out
to be a version of the nation's most popular sport-utility vehicle
_ the Ford Explorer _ while the other is positioned as a version of
the nation's most popular vehicle, period _ the Ford F-150 pickup.
</P>
<P>
   The Explorer Sport Trac essentially is an Explorer SUV with the
cargo compartment's top chopped off to create a combination
Explorer/pickup, while the SuperCrew is, essentially, a Ford
Expedition with the cargo area's top chopped off to create a pickup
bed.
</P>
<P>
   But as most of us know, the Expedition is really a full-size
F-150 pickup with the cargo area covered up, turned into a
family-hauling sport-utility.
</P>
<P>
   And the Explorer? It's a Ford Ranger compact pickup turned into
a sport-utility.
</P>
<P>
   Confused?
</P>
<P>
   In this day and age of cost-cutting and more efficient
manufacturing, automakers are sharing their various vehicle
platforms among a variety of different products more than ever, and
it's hard sometimes to tell just by looking what vehicle is derived
from what other vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The SuperCrew is to the Expedition what the Sport Trac is to the
Explorer. From the front bumper to the back of the rear seat, the
SuperCrew is an Expedition. Sure, there are some minor cosmetic
differences, but they're really just superficial. Then from the
back of the rear seat to the tailgate, this becomes an F-150
pickup, although with a shortened bed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, calling it the F-150 SuperCrew instead of the Expedition
Sport Trac (or something along that line) might be a misstep. This
vehicle is going to appeal more to the sport-utility crowd than the
pickup crowd, because it is first and foremost a passenger vehicle.
The pickup bed seems almost an afterthought, especially since it is
smaller than the average F-150 bed _ just 5.5 feet long (a sheet of
plywood is eight feet long, and will fit into many full-size pickup
beds).
</P>
<P>
   People who need a real pickup won't want the SuperCrew because
of its limited cargo-hauling capabilities. But people who like the
idea of the Explorer Sport Trac, yet want more passenger and cargo
room, might flock to the SuperCrew if they see it as a larger
version of the Sport Trac, rather than as a crew-cab pickup for
commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Who cares what they call it. The SuperCrew is a great
idea, just like the Sport Trac, and I had fun driving it for a
week.
</P>
<P>
   My only complaint was the same one I had with the Sport Trac: If
the vehicle is full of people, then any cargo you carry has to go
outside in the bed, exposed to the elements.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you planning to take family trips with the
SuperCrew, the luggage would have to be stowed in the bed, and that
could subject your stuff to wind, rain and sun.
</P>
<P>
   So even though the SuperCrew isn't the most practical family
vehicle, it does have its attributes, and it will fill the needs of
many people who choose to buy it. It will be great for hauling
dirty toys (such as muddy four-wheelers and such) while the
passengers remain inside in clean comfort.
</P>
<P>
   And, like the Explorer Sport Trac, the SuperCrew isn't as
expensive as the sport-utility vehicle it is derived from.
</P>
<P>
   The base price for a two-wheel-drive, entry-level SuperCrew (the
XLT model) is $26,090 (plus $665 transportation), compared with
$29,655 for the two-wheel-drive Expedition XLT.
</P>
<P>
   That's nearly a $3,600 discount for having the back third of the
vehicle chopped off. What a deal! That means that you can buy an
almost-Expedition for $3,600 less than a real Expedition, if you
can live with an uncovered cargo area.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the Expedition, the SuperCrew is available with either
the 4.6-liter Ford Triton V-8 engine (which is standard) or the
5.4-liter Triton V-8, an $800 option.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.6-liter engine is rated at 220 horsepower and 290
foot-pounds of torque; the 5.4-liter offers 260 horsepower and 350
foot-pounds of torque. When properly equipped, the SuperCrew can
tow a trailer of up to 8,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a four-speed electronically controlled automatic
transmission with overdrive. A limited-slip rear axle is available
for $285.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the SuperCrew is as comfy as an Expedition, and can
carry five full-size adults easily. A sixth person can squeeze
between the driver and front outboard passenger if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The SuperCrew is the same overall length as the 139-inch
wheelbase F-150 SuperCab model, which is an advantage when
maneuvering in tight spaces such as parking lots or garages, Ford
says. What the SuperCrew lacks in bed length is added to the
passenger compartment to increase leg room for the people in the
rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   An optional bed extender ($195) lengthens the cargo area to
seven feet. This metal cage folds out onto the open tailgate to
hold cargo into place, using the flat tailgate surface as the
additional cargo area.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with its Expedition heritage, the SuperCrew has
electrically adjustable pedals _ the only pickup with this feature.
A switch will raise the brake and accelerator pedals for people
with short legs, or lower them closer to the floor for long-legged
folks.
</P>
<P>
   This system also is available on the Expedition, the large Ford
Excursion SUV and on the Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable sedans. It is
designed to allow short people to sit far enough back in the seat
to keep them from being injured by the air bag, should it deploy.
</P>
<P>
   In most vehicles, really short people have to scoot the seat as
far forward as possible so they can reach the pedals. In doing so,
they position themselves too close to the steering wheel, in which
the air bag is mounted. Some people have died from being too close
to the air bag when it deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The SuperCrew drives and rides just like an Expedition; the ride
seems to be more carlike than in the typical pickup, but part of
that could be due to the passenger-carlike interior accouterments.
</P>
<P>
   Two trim levels are offered, and each can be purchased with two-
or four-wheel drive. The XLT is the base model, while the Lariat is
the premium.
</P>
<P>
   The two-wheel-drive Lariat is $27,670 (plus transportation and
options); the four-wheel-drive XLT lists for $29,310; and the
four-wheel-drive Lariat is $31,125.
</P>
<P>
   Braking is excellent, thanks to the power-assisted four-wheel
disc system with antilock.
</P>
<P>
   Power steering, air conditioning, power windows/mirrors/door
locks, cruise control, remote keyless entry and power outside
mirrors are standard.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 12 miles per gallon city/17 highway
for the 5.4-liter engine, and 15 mpg city/20 highway for the
4.6-liter.
</P>
<P>
   The tank holds 25 gallons of gasoline.

&HT;     NBC SEARCHES FOR ITS OWN `TREND' SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ You want to praise NBC's top entertainment
executives, or at least feel sorry for them, but you can't.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't have ``Survivor'' or ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't even have a piece of piffle like ``Making the Band.''
</P>
<P>
   Too highbrow? Too much class?
</P>
<P>
   Nope: Too late.
</P>
<P>
   When the reality wave struck, NBC just stood there on the beach
with its surfboard tucked under its arm, feet sunk in the sand. The
network talks about developing such a show soon _ but there's a
feeling that by the time they take the plunge, the water will be
calm or even chilly.
</P>
<P>
   You want to give props to NBC West President Scott Sassa and NBC
Entertainment President Garth Ancier for sticking with quality
dramas and comedies. The network did give us ``The West Wing'' last
year, and still has ``ER,'' ``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``Friends,''
``Frasier'' and ``Will &AMP; Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   You know behind closed doors they are getting pounded by the
higher-ups. They joke about it breezily to critics, but these are
the guys who are going to get marooned unless they strike reality
gold. Yes, you want to be in their corner. But you can't.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a lot easier to defend them if they were presenting
a new fall slate of shows that were full of the richness and
originality and, yes, the truth that only good dramas and comedies
can offer. Maybe one of their seven new series will rise to that
lofty level _ but I don't see it happening, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, NBC acknowledges that it has been tardy on another
important trend: Launching shows in the summer against weak rerun
competition. ABC did it two years in a row with ``Whose Line Is It
Anyway?'' and ``Millionaire,'' while CBS is scoring huge with
``Survivor'' and is hoping to cash in on ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, instead of leading the next trend, NBC is going to jump
into reality as well, probably next summer. ``This is not just a
fad, it's a trend,'' Sassa said. ``It's going to be around for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the shows the network is looking at is the Dutch program
``Chains of Love,'' in which four guys are handcuffed to a woman,
then voted out one by one. ``It's a relationship show,'' Ancier
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fill in the punch line of your choice here.
</P>
<P>
   Ancier said the lesson learned from everyone copycatting
``Millionaire'' (poorly) last year is to not rush into a genre just
because a show is hot.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a better idea: Don't rush in at all.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of giving us the next Regis, give us a different
alternative. Great shows would be a start.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? That could even be the next wave.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the scene would have been unfathomable: a news
conference with the cast and writers of ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' where the
focus of discussion was not the homosexuality of two of the key
characters.
</P>
<P>
   The pressing issue for the third-year NBC comedy is that it's
moving to the coveted 9 p.m. Thursday time slot, the former home to
classics such as ``Cheers,'' ``Seinfeld'' and ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've accomplished what we try to do, which is to try to make
the show mainstream, and (that's why) we're on Thursday night,''
said executive producer/director James Burrows, who also created
``Cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ``Titans,'' the new NBC cheesefest soap from Aaron Spelling, is
so over-the-top it might be the most unintentionally funny show
this season.
</P>
<P>
   All this and Casper Van Dien (of ``Starship Troopers''), who
makes Al Gore look as loose as Gregory Hines.
</P>
<P>
   The show is so bad it may just be brilliant, but we're rooting
for you, Casper.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Silicon Valley is getting ready to challenge
Detroit for a piece of the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   A company called Model E plans to offer a high-tech alternative
to the traditional automakers by manufacturing built-to-order,
limited edition cars that can be ordered on line.
</P>
<P>
   The company, backed by Softbank Venture Capital of Mountain
View, Calif., will also offer the option of ``subscribing'' to a
car or several models over a period of time as an alternative to
buying or renting.
</P>
<P>
   The concept would allow the company to bypass the dealers and
establish a direct relationship with the customer. Model E's plan
is to handle every aspect _ the vehicle design, personalized
features, financing, registration, as well as maintenance and
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   According to a news release from the Fremont, Calif., company,
customers will be able to subscribe to various car models over a
specific period, such as three cars over a two-year span.
</P>
<P>
   The investors in Model E plan to make an official announcement
about the company and its business lines next month.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Leathern, digital commerce analyst for Jupiter
Communications, said he is aware of the company and finds the
concept ``intriguing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That isn't something that exists today,'' he said. ``It may
well be exciting for the consumer. But ultimately it will be judged
on whether it meets a need. We've seen a lot of cool ideas that
just haven't worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is planning to develop customized vehicles that can
be ordered over the Internet. Those cars, limited edition models,
are scheduled to be available next year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Model E will have an ``eConcierge'' team to handle
registration and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from the venture capital arm of Softbank, the
Japanese Internet investor, did not return calls for comment.
Efforts to reach Model E's chief executive officer, Bill Li, and
co-founder George Kim were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Model E's management team comes from such companies as Lexus,
Toyota, Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp., Ritz Carlton, Walt
Disney Co., Apple Computer and America Online.

&HT;     GUIDE TO ON-LINE HEALTH RESOURCES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RICHARD A. MARINI  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the earliest days of the Internet, health and medical
sites have been some of the most popular on the World Wide Web. But
today there is much more to do on line besides simply looking up
the latest news on a specific disease or ailment.
</P>
<P>
   New sites now do stuff that previously required a trip to the
gym, the drugstore or even the doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of interesting and useful sites out there,''
said Charles B. Inlander, president of the People's Medical
Society, a medical consumer advocacy organization based in
Allentown, Pa. ``But like everything else when it's new, it's buyer
beware.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. For example, the once-high flying DrKoop.com, which
traded on the reputation of former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop, came under blistering attack last year for not making a clear
distinction between its medical content and advertising. The site
now more clearly labels information provided by or sponsored by
outside companies.
</P>
<P>
   The following are some of the best sites recommended by Internet
experts. While they are listed under certain categories, most also
offer other health- and medicine-related services. These can
include medical news, e-mail newsletters and general health and
fitness information.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Site type: On-line Drugstore
</P>
<P>
   Name/URL: Drugstore.com, www.drugstore.com
</P>
<P>
   Description: Sells a full-line of prescription and
over-the-counter drugs, health and beauty aids and medical devices.
If it's in your neighborhood drugstore, you'll likely find here.
</P>
<P>
   Good Stuff: Accepts most major insurance plans and claims to
monitor prices so it can sell for less than national drug
stores--especially with free standard shipping. Offers e-mail
reminders to replenish regularly ordered products. Pharmacists are
available 24/7 to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Stuff: Delivery can take two to 14 days, way too long in an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Site type: On-line drugstore
</P>
<P>
   Name/URL: Walgreens, www.walgreens.com
</P>
<P>
   Description: The on-line version of the familiar chain sells
only prescription medicine. Need shampoo? You'll have to go
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Good Stuff: Prescriptions can be delivered by mail or picked up
at any Walgreens store. The site maintains a complete prescription
history to make re-ordering easy and avoid potentially dangerous
drug interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Stuff: Limiting the selection to prescription drugs also
limits the site's usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Site Type: Consult a Doctor
</P>
<P>
   Name/URL: AmericasDoctor, www.americasdoctor.com
</P>
<P>
   Description: Offers free, one-on-one chats with board-certified
or board-eligible physicians. Doctors will answer general questions
and suggest sources of information, but won't diagnose, recommend
specific treatments or prescribe medication.
</P>
<P>
   Good Stuff: The user-friendly site provides fast, if anonymous,
answers to basic questions.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Stuff: Doctors are extremely limited in what they'll say or
do. (The site repeatedly warns that they're not entering a
traditional doctor-patient relationship with you.) For more
personalized help, see your regular doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Site Type: Consult a Doctor
</P>
<P>
   Name/URL: CyberDocs, www.cyberdocs.com
</P>
<P>
   Description: Provides confidential consultations with
U.S.-trained, board-certified physicians either immediately or by
appointment. Doctors will address simple medical problems and, if
circumstances warrant, initiate treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Good Stuff: Physicians will prescribe medication only from a
carefully selected list of approved drugs. Drugs that require close
supervision or can be easily abused are not available. Patients are
advised to seek an appropriate follow-up in a hospital or office
setting, although there's no enforcement procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Stuff: Depending on the medical specialty and where you're
located, you may have a choice of only one or two physicians. And
CyberDocs are not available in all states. Consultation fees range
from $50 to $75.
</P>
<P>

includes background and contact information on virtually every
licensed physician practicing in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Good Stuff: Comprehensive listings can be searched by name or
medical specialty and all information has been verified for
accuracy. Most listings include the physician's office hours, phone
numbers and educational background. Some even have maps with
driving directions.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Stuff: Raw listings provide only basic information.
Physicians haven't been screened for competency.

available for a $975 fee to help get the best medical care
available. A Spanish language version of the site is also
available.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Stuff: The ``best'' doctor may be several hundred miles from
where you live. The site charges a $25 fee per referral.

&HT;        REGIONAL OIL RESERVE CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 21 - With another winter of punishing home
heating costs possible in the Northeast, federal energy officials
and members of Congress are scrambling to assemble an emergency oil
reserve to help prevent shortages that hit the region hard last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Department of Energy pushes to have two million
barrels of home heating oil stored by October 1, and as Northeast
lawmakers push legislation needed to authorize the president to tap
the oil, the initiative is coming under fire from a skeptical oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Energy analysts and oil industry officials said in interviews
that, at best, the reserve is a politically-motivated measure whose
ability to ease the effect of low supply and price spikes is
unproven. At worst, they said, government intervention could
disrupt the heating oil market at a cost to oil marketers, and
ultimately make matters worse for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Although five months remain before buyers begin to stockpile
heating oil, the outlook for the coming winter in New England,
where the majority of heating oil is used, is already bleak. The
region's inventories are one-fourth the size they were at this time
last year, and oil prices are running about 65 percent higher than
they were a year ago, according to the American Petroleum
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after the Strategic Petroleum Reserve -- a stockpile of
crude oil held on the Gulf Coast for national crises -- the
regional reserve is for emergency use only. The president would be
allowed to draw oil in times of short supply, when extreme cold
snaps cause demand -- and prices -- to spike. The Department of
Energy is soliciting bids for the storage facilities -- due August
1 -- and is considering splitting the reserve into as many as four
areas -- Boston, New Haven, New York harbor and a site in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet oil company officials from the region said the government
effort to affect the price of heating oil - a publicly traded
commodity -- threatens to disrupt the market and cause oil buyers
to be more cautious. The chief concern, they said, is that during
extreme weather conditions, oil companies would refrain from buying
oil if they believed the government was about to tap the reserves.
This could exacerbate supply shortages like those that rocked New
England last winter, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's looking for a disaster,'' said Alfred Slifka,
chairman of Global Petroleum in Waltham. ``I'm going to lose a
fortune. I haven't heard one economist that says this makes
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar argument has been made against the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, which has only been tapped once, by President Bush during
the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said the stockpile would come under intense
political pressure from Northeast residents, creating great
uncertainties for the independent heating oil buyers in New
England, who purchase their supplies in weekly increments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a political trigger was pulled, it could devalue the
inventory of the wholesale market overnight,'' said Jack Sullivan,
executive vice president and CEO of New England Fuel Institute in
Watertown. ``That's frightening. A regional reserve is a tremendous
disincentive to re-supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Last January's crisis came when oil stockpiles - in severe
shortage following the decision to limit crude oil production by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries - couldn't keep
up with demand during cold snaps. When the temperature plummeted in
January, prices jumped 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who took a battering of
criticism over high gas prices in the Midwest this summer, now is
focusing attention on the Northeast, and last week announced a set
of 14 policy recommendations aimed at diversifying the region's
energy sources. In a meeting last week with regional oil industry
officials, Richardson gave assurances that the reserve wouldn't be
used to jigger market prices. ``DOE doesn't involve itself in the
market,'' said spokesman Drew Malcolm. ``The secretary assured them
it would not become a market issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The reserve is a top priority for Northeast legislators, who
said the exorbitant heating bills of last year are simply
unacceptable. ``I'm not comfortable leaving it up to market forces
to determine the price when the prices could go through the roof
and people can't afford to heat their homes,'' said Representative
James McGovern, a Worcester Democrat, who helped pitch the reserve
to Clinton last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that had we had a sizable reserve of home heating
oil we could have dealt with the price spikes'' last winter, said
Representative John Olver, Democrat of Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the impact of the reserve on heating costs is uncertain.
Conservation may be the real solution, said Bob Slaughter, public
policy director at the National Petrochemical and Refiners
Association. Moreover, two million barrels would last no more than
two days in the entire Northeast region.
</P>
<P>
   The energy department is tackling several thorny questions about
where and how to set up the facility. Still undetermined is who
would pick up and distribute the oil, and how long would it take to
deliver it to residents' homes if it was released. Environmental
and procurement regulations are also possible stumbling blocks to
getting it in place quickly, industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation that authorizes the actual use of the reserve is
the most pressing concern, however. Senator Olympia Snowe, a Maine
Democrat, secured $4 million in funding to operate it through
September, 2001, attached to a spending bill passed in the Senate
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the president is unable to tap it without legislation that
decides upon what should trigger its release, and the oil industry
and state governments are preparing to battle with Congress over
the details of the unwritten legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The reserve funding may also face opposition from oil-state
lawmakers. ``There is enough of a push'' for a reserve, said
Representative Richard Neal, a Springfield Democrat. ``The question
is how much resistance is there going to be?''

DID YOU KNOW THAT BILL CLINTON WAS BORN IN AREA 51?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno never defined Christians as cultists
on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' _ not in 1994, not in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no such legislation as Bill 602P in Congress that
would allow the U.S. Postal Service to charge a fee on e-mail
communications.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't bother to check out this electronic garbage
masquerading as truth before forwarding it to every name in your
e-mail address book, you end up looking like an idiot. Well
deserved, I might add.
</P>
<P>
   The Reno urban legend is in its umpteenth time around the
circuit. The first time I received it, almost two years ago, the
date for her alleged diatribe against religious followers was June
26, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was a Sunday, when ``60 Minutes'' airs. The latest
incarnation was updated to an appearance on June 26, 1999. Same
exact words to define a cultist _ ``A cultist is one who has a
strong belief in the Bible and the Second Coming of Christ; who
frequently attends Bible studies; who has a high level of financial
giving to a Christian cause ...'' _ just a different broadcast
date.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that June 26, 1999, was a Saturday. Why let an easily
verifiable fact stand in the way of a conspiracy tirade?
</P>
<P>
   As for Bill 602P, the ``alternative postage fee'' bill that will
allow the federal government to charge a 5-cent fee on every
e-mail, a high school government student should be able to spot
that it's bogus just by looking at the designation of the bill. If
the ``P'' wasn't enough to throw you off, then Tony Schnell, named
in the e-mail as a congressional representative in favor of the
idea, should. No such person serves in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram published an editorial debunking
the e-mail charge net hoax on June 9, 1999. Yet what popped up in
my e-mail on Monday? The exactly worded message decrying those
stinkin' feds for sneaking around behind our backs, trying to tax
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is a marvelous creation, but you'd think people who
are technologically savvy enough to create a long mailing list of
addresses could also do a simple search for pending federal
legislation or, simpler yet, members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For those who might hesitate a nanosecond before sending along
this kind of tripe, there is a helpful Web site at
www.urbanlegends.about.com where skeptics can check out the
veracity of this e-junk. Here's what the October 1998 archive
posting said about the Reno e-mail (note the date _ it blows a big
hole in the ``I know she was interviewed on June 26, 1999''
theory):
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasonable people tempted to believe this nonsense owe it to
themselves to read it a second and third time and consider how
plausible it is. If such a statement really had been broadcast over
national television it would have resulted in a loud and immediate
condemnation from conservatives in the Congress and Senate. It
would have been denounced from every pulpit in the United States.
You would not have heard about it first in an anonymous forwarded
email several years after the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasonable people.'' Ahh, there's the rub. People who hate
Bill Clinton and anyone associated with his administration
apparently lose the ability to be reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care for him, either, but people, please, let's get a
grip on reality. The truths about this administration are bad
enough without making up stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The propensity for some people to consider any information that
wends its way along the electronic superhighway as gospel points to
a deeper problem than just gullibility and laziness.
</P>
<P>
   The value of truth in this country is dropping faster than a
dot.com's stock prices. Inane ramblings on talk radio that amount
to little more than the conspiracy theory du jour are devoured as
dictum by some people just because the host can string words
together in sentences that end with periods.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate Web sites with official-sounding names post pseudo
news stories whose sources are slim in number and anonymous in
name. Television networks have done such a seamless job of melding
news with entertainment that it's nigh-on impossible to tell where
one ends and the next begins.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the truth is never easy. And although the advent
of the Internet has made it faster, all the gee-whiz technology in
the world can't take the place of a discriminating, analytical
human brain that can separate the credible from the incredible.
</P>
<P>
   If only people would use them.
</P>

   LYRICS-EDIT (Undated) _ An array of song-lyric review and
editing procedures have become a routine part of the record
business. Artists with explicit material are routinely asked to
re-sing lyrics, edit out particular words and even excise entire
songs from albums. By Neil Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   CHOREOGRAPHERS-LEGACY (Undated) _ A growing sophistication about
preserving the legacy of dance has largely institutionalized the
handing-down of choreography, which was first passed down from
dancer to dancer, then by written notation and film and video. The
idea of owning a dance as property is relatively new. Changes in
copyright law are in part responsible for this, as well as
increasing general interest in copyright and ownership in a
new-media age that has effectively widened the possibilities of
illegal appropriation of artistic property. By Jennifer Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-ARTS-CENTER (Snowmass Village, Colo.) _ Rustic cattle barns
and sheep sheds that until 1966 were the heart of an active ranch
here now draw acclaimed and aspiring artists from around the world.
The Anderson Ranch Arts Center is a bucolic center for potters,
photographers, painters, printmakers, woodworkers, sculptors, art
historians and critics. By Elizabeth Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   MAGIC-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ In ``Thomas and the Magic
Railroad,'' which moves the PBS children's show ``Shining Time
Station'' to the big screen, Alec Baldwin plays Mr. Conductor. He
brings to the role not only the most sinister voice ever heard on a
good guy in a G-rated movie, but he performs with a vigor not
normally seen in such a picture. By Elvis Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   WATERFORD-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``New Waterford Girl,''
directed by Allan Moyle, is animated by a feisty spirit. It's about
a young girl's struggle for independence against the forces _ her
parents, her town, the way things are _ that rein her in. Reviewed
by A.O. Scott.
</P>
<P>
   SIGN-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Aimee Bender's intriguing ``An
Invisible Sign of my Own'' pursues a course through the charmingly
deformed personality of its narrator, evoking as it goes the dark
themes of the parable. Reviewed by Richard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   HUNTRESS-TV-REVIEW (Undated) _ If played straight, ``The
Huntress,'' a series that USA is unveiling Wednesday night, would
surely be tiresome. But presented as an off-kilter spoof, and
draped around a winningly drawn central character, the premise has
promise. Reviewed by Ron Wertheimer.

<P>
   Once, flying around Europe was an expensive and difficult
proposition involving just a handful of big-name airlines. Today,
there's a new army of smaller, ``niche'' carriers in Europe, whose
names are largely unknown not only to most Americans but also to
many American travel agents. Airlines with names like Eurowings,
easyJet, and Spanair.
</P>
<P>
   Airline deregulation, to which Americans grew accustomed more
than 20 years ago, is relatively new to the Continent. In the past,
governments in Bonn, London, and Paris regulated not only air
routes but also airfares.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's a free-for-all in the skies, and the revolution
benefits passengers by providing a wealth of options and cities to
fly into, often at substantially lower fares.
</P>
<P>
   Buzzing around Europe by air has become almost as easy as buying
a Eurail pass.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these smaller airlines were started by major carriers
that watched the success of Southwest Airlines in the U.S. and
decided that if anyone was going to cash in with low-cost service,
it might as well be them.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, British Airways spawned a stepsister named
Go; last year, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines started a subsidiary called
Buzz.
</P>
<P>
   What are the drawbacks? To begin with, many of the European
niche airlines fly in and out of secondary airports.
</P>
<P>
   While most Americans are used to landing at or departing from
London's Heathrow or Gatwick airports, Go flies out of Stansted, 30
miles northeast of London. EasyJet, begun by a 33-year-old Greek
entrepreneur known only as Stelios, calls London's obscure Luton
(32 miles north of the city's center) its home base.
</P>
<P>
   These airports aren't any more difficult to reach than Heathrow
and Gatwick, but you face a hefty commute if you're connecting via
one of the two major airports.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the airlines have baggage agreements with major carriers
(just as Southwest doesn't in the U.S.), so you can't check your
luggage through when you're connecting. You'll have to fetch your
bags from a baggage area and recheck them on your next flight.
</P>

<P>
   Once, flying around Europe was an expensive and difficult
proposition involving just a handful of big-name airlines. Today,
there's a new army of smaller, ``niche'' carriers in Europe, whose
names are largely unknown not only to most Americans but also to
many American travel agents. Airlines with names like Eurowings,
easyJet, and Spanair.
</P>
<P>
   Airline deregulation, to which Americans grew accustomed more
than 20 years ago, is relatively new to the Continent. In the past,
governments in Bonn, London, and Paris regulated not only air
routes but also airfares.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's a free-for-all in the skies, and the revolution
benefits passengers by providing a wealth of options and cities to
fly into, often at substantially lower fares.
</P>
<P>
   Buzzing around Europe by air has become almost as easy as buying
a Eurail pass.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these smaller airlines were started by major carriers
that watched the success of Southwest Airlines in the U.S. and
decided that if anyone was going to cash in with low-cost service,
it might as well be them.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, British Airways spawned a stepsister named
Go; last year, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines started a subsidiary called
Buzz.
</P>
<P>
   What are the drawbacks? To begin with, many of the European
niche airlines fly in and out of secondary airports.
</P>
<P>
   While most Americans are used to landing at or departing from
London's Heathrow or Gatwick airports, Go flies out of Stansted, 30
miles northeast of London. EasyJet, begun by a 33-year-old Greek
entrepreneur known only as Stelios, calls London's obscure Luton
(32 miles north of the city's center) its home base.
</P>
<P>
   These airports aren't any more difficult to reach than Heathrow
and Gatwick, but you face a hefty commute if you're connecting via
one of the two major airports.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the airlines have baggage agreements with major carriers
(just as Southwest doesn't in the U.S.), so you can't check your
luggage through when you're connecting. You'll have to fetch your
bags from a baggage area and recheck them on your next flight.
</P>
<P>
   Not all airlines have toll-free telephone numbers accessible
from the United States. And not all Web sites offer English
versions, so polish up on your Croatian.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan on hopping around Europe, you may want to consider a
Europe Flight Pass, a coupon book that allows you to fly one-way or
round-trip on any of 16 participating airlines (serving 127 cities
in nearly 30 countries) for $99 per segment.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, you must buy at least three segments, and you can use
the coupons for up to 120 days after your first flight. And while
you must purchase your coupons before going overseas, you may make
specific reservations anytime, in the U.S. or elsewhere. Details:

   (Will move in ``e'' news file)
</P>
<P>
   LYRICS-EDIT (Undated) _ An array of song-lyric review and
editing procedures have become a routine part of the record
business. Artists with explicit material are routinely asked to
re-sing lyrics, edit out particular words and even excise entire
songs from albums. By Neil Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   CHOREOGRAPHERS-LEGACY (Undated) _ A growing sophistication about
preserving the legacy of dance has largely institutionalized the
handing-down of choreography, which was first passed down from
dancer to dancer, then by written notation and film and video. The
idea of owning a dance as property is relatively new. Changes in
copyright law are in part responsible for this, as well as
increasing general interest in copyright and ownership in a
new-media age that has effectively widened the possibilities of
illegal appropriation of artistic property. By Jennifer Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-ARTS-CENTER (Snowmass Village, Colo.) _ Rustic cattle barns
and sheep sheds that until 1966 were the heart of an active ranch

photographers, painters, printmakers, woodworkers, sculptors, art
historians and critics. By Elizabeth Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   MAGIC-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ In ``Thomas and the Magic
Railroad,'' which moves the PBS children's show ``Shining Time
Station'' to the big screen, Alec Baldwin plays Mr. Conductor. He
brings to the role not only the most sinister voice ever heard on a
good guy in a G-rated movie, but he performs with a vigor not
normally seen in such a picture. Reviewed by Elvis Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   WATERFORD-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``New Waterford Girl,''
directed by Allan Moyle, is animated by a feisty spirit. It's about
a young girl's struggle for independence against the forces _ her
parents, her town, the way things are _ that rein her in. Reviewed
by A.O. Scott.
</P>
<P>
   SIGN-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Aimee Bender's intriguing ``An
Invisible Sign of my Own'' pursues a course through the charmingly
deformed personality of its narrator, evoking as it goes the dark
themes of the parable. Reviewed by Richard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   HUNTRESS-TV-REVIEW (Undated) _ If played straight, ``The
Huntress,'' a series that USA is unveiling Wednesday night, would
surely be tiresome. But presented as an off-kilter spoof, and
draped around a winningly drawn central character, the premise has
promise. Reviewed by Ron Wertheimer.

   LONG-ISLAND-WINE (Peconic, N.Y.) _ Wine Talk Column: The Long
Island wine business is booming; it's almost giddy from its own
success. Handsome new wineries are opening, old ones are changing
hands for astonishing prices, new vineyards are springing up, and
suddenly, there isn't enough wine to go around. By Frank J. Prial.
</P>
<P>
   PARMIGIANO (Undated) _ Most people who buy Parmigiano-Reggiano
never give a thought to the variations in the way it tastes. I
always assumed the flavor differences had to do with the aging
process or the quality of the cheese itself. Or so I thought until
last week, when I tasted Parmigiano-Reggiano produced in fall,
winter, spring and summer. I was amazed at how distinctive each one
was. By Marian Burros. (With photo)
</P>
<P>
   PLATE-PAINTING (New York) _ Critic's Notebook: Some things you
don't miss until they're gone. The painted plate is one of them. It
was not too many years ago that no plate left a New York kitchen
until, like a subway car parked overnight in a railyard, it had
been decorated in drips, dots, dabs and hash marks. Now white is
making a comeback. By William Grimes.
</P>

processed by a new method are winning converts among New York chefs

   CHATEAU-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ The pretentious tone of the
title aside, ``From My Chateau Kitchen,'' by Anne Willan, is
accessible and reliable. Willan, the founder of La Varenne, a

headquarters (the U.S. branch of the school is at the Greenbrier

HDTV COSTS MAKE ITS FUTURE LOOK FUZZY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kevin Miller remembers the first time he saw
high-definition television. It was at the Consumer Electronics Show
in Las Vegas. Zenith was demonstrating an HDTV broadcast of a Ray
Charles concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stunning,'' Miller said. ``You could see the beads of
sweat on his forehead as clearly as anything you've seen in real
life. When the camera zoomed in on the microphone, you could see
all the metal mesh. You saw the fingerprint smudges on the piano.
These kinds of details just jumped off the screen and freaked you
out. I couldn't wait to see more.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in January 1996. HDTV was heralded as the television of
the future. Four years later, the future hasn't come much closer.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is now audio-video editor of etown.com, a
consumer-electronics Webzine. He spends much of his time watching,
reviewing, tweaking, and installing the most high-tech televisions
on the market. But he's still waiting for HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the technology,'' he says. ``The technology is here,
HDTV sets are here. It's the chicken-egg problem _ that's what's
holding things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Chickens and eggs are the common metaphor that people in the
industry use to describe the predicament.
</P>
<P>
   The chickens are the network chiefs, who don't want to spend
millions of dollars on HDTV cameras, tape machines, and
transmission hardware when only a teeny segment of viewers own HDTV
sets and decoders.
</P>
<P>
   The eggs are the consumers, who don't want to spend thousands of
dollars on HDTV sets and decoders when the networks are
broadcasting only a handful of HDTV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle are the TV manufacturers, who can lower
prices on these sets only so far as long as consumer demand remains
so meager.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, they have cut prices by 20 to 50 percent.
However, that still leaves these sets at $2,000 minimum, with most
of them well more than double that, still too expensive for a
mass-market commodity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done our part, so when is there going to be something
worth watching?'' asks Dave Arland, spokesman for Thomson Consumer
Electronics, which owns RCA. ``People aren't going to make the
switch if there's not enough to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, ABC broadcast ``Monday Night Football'' in
high-definition. There were 32 local ABC stations with the hardware
to carry the beam. But, one network executive complained, ``We have
no idea how many people were watching. And there's no evidence that
the broadcast increased sales of HDTV sets.''
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic paid for the HD equipment and the HD transmission, at
a reported cost of $2.2 million for the season. But the deal will
not be renewed next season.
</P>
<P>
   Some public and cable networks are dipping into HDTV on their
own dime. PBS is experimenting, with WGBH in Boston leading the way
in producing programs in high-definition. The Discovery Channel
will start doing so next year. DirecTV satellites currently carry
one Showtime and two HBO channels that beam movies in HDTV format.
</P>
<P>
   The major networks are hesitating, unless the manufacturers pick
up the tab. Samsung has funded HD broadcasts of movies for CBS,
Thomson covered HD transmissions of the NCAA basketball tournament,
Sony supplies HD equipment for golf tournaments and for NBC's
``Tonight Show,'' the only program broadcast nightly in
high-definition.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi paid for HD broadcasts of CBS's entire prime-time
lineup this past season, but, like Panasonic and ``Monday Night
Football,'' the company is not renewing the deal, though it will
pay for some sports and specials. CBS is looking around for other
sponsors. Glen Dickson of Broadcasting &AMP; Cable Magazine says the
network will suspend the experiment if none are found.
</P>
<P>
   Many manufacturers are growing impatient. ``The gravy train is
over,'' Arland said. ``We're not Proctor &AMP; Gamble. It's time the TV
broadcasters, who have been given their free airwaves, make use of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is, new digital TV sets _ the only kind that can pick
up HDTV signals _ are selling better than expected. According to
the Consumer Electronics Association over 200,000 of these TVs have
been sold since coming on the market in August 1998. Sales so far
this year are 4 1/2 times larger than this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this market is but a speck on the larger horizon. There
are 250 million old-fashioned analog TV sets in US households _
meaning digital TVs constitute less than one-tenth of 1 percent of
what's out there.
</P>
<P>
   And this speck has little to do with HDTV. Gary Merson, author
of the Web newsletter hdtvinsider.com, said, ``HDTV programs are
not what's driving the digital TV market. It's DVD home-theater,''
which ``looks great on digital televisions.''
</P>
<P>
   To pick up HDTV broadcasts, even digital TVs must be hooked up
to special HD decoder boxes, the cheapest of which cost $650.
According to industry figures, just 33,000 of these boxes have been
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Callahan, marketing director for Princeton Graphics, which
makes computer and HDTV monitors, glumly asked, ``If you were Mike
Eisner, would you want to spend a lot of money to please 30,000
people?''
</P>
<P>
   Again: the chicken-and-egg problem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, HDTV does have appeal, for three reasons. First, it is
broadcast in widescreen, like a movie at a theater. By comparison,
normal TV images seem square and cramped.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it is broadcast digitally _ a series of coded zeros and
ones _ which means the signal comes in perfectly, with no
ghost-images.
</P>
<P>
   Third and most impressive, it is ``high-definition.'' A normal
TV image is made up of 480 lines. HDTV is made up of either 1,080
lines or 720 lines that are scanned twice as quickly. This accounts
for the vast improvement in detail, the you-are-there presence, and
for how smoothly people and objects move across the screen. Regular
TV and even DVDs seem murky and choppy by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you show people HDTV, they want it,'' said Kevin Miller.
``That's a fact. I've seen that response many times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission is pushing the networks to
pick up speed. FCC regulations require all broadcasters to shift
entirely to digital by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   First, while high-definition is digital, digital does not
necessarily mean high-definition.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Congress has added a proviso that this change-over will
take place only if 85 percent of US households have digital TVs.
Few believe this will be the case. For instance, commonplace as
cable TV seems today, it has penetrated just 67 percent of homes.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Consumer Electronics Association predicts that if
broadcasters go full-speed ahead, digital TVs will reach just 50
percent of homes by 2006. If delays continue, the estimate drops to
between 15 percent and 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, the networks know they can move at whatever
pace their cautious budgets allow.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Smith, head of the Boston-based Professional Audio/Video
Retailers Association, recently attended a summit of consumer
electronics CEOs. ``Everybody was saying that all the lobbying to
get broadcasters to move on HDTV just keeps hitting a brick wall,''
Smith recalls. ``It's very expensive for the broadcasters. It's
just not happening. It may not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Pete Putman, a video consultant and HDTV advocate,
said, ``We're still in a stage where things have just barely
begun.''
</P>
<P>
   The first nationwide HDTV broadcast took place in October 1998.
Since then, things have moved ahead far more swiftly than color TV
at its early stages.
</P>
<P>
   Color TV made its national debut in 1954, with a closed-circuit
telecast of the Rose Bowl Parade. Five years later, there were just
three shows televised regularly in color, all on NBC: ``Perry
Como,'' ``Bonanza,'' and ``Walt Disney's Wonderful World of
Color.'' Not till 1965 did all three networks start dipping their
toes into color.
</P>
<P>
   According to TV historian Ed Reitan, 1965 marked the first year
that more than 1 million color TV sets were manufactured, and the
typical set cost $1,000, a staggering sum at a time when the
average annual income was $7,200.
</P>
<P>
   It is striking that, in today's dollars, this price tag
translates to $5,600, the same as many of today's HDTV sets.
</P>
<P>
   There are two big differences between now and then, though.
``Back then, TV was about the only form of home entertainment,''
Putman says. ``Now people get it from lots of things. HDTV is going
to have to get a lot cheaper before a lot of people buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, back then, NBC, the network pushing color TV the
hardest, was owned by RCA, the company producing the most color TV
sets. There was a collusion for color between the biggest network
and the biggest manufacturer. Now, with HDTV, there is only
fighting, which everyone agrees might be the biggest stumbling
block on the road.

GRAND JURY SAID TO PROBE TEAMSTER FILM CONTRACTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With Movies-Union; a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY AND STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal grand jury is investigating allegations that
local Teamsters Union officials extorted Hollywood producers who
filmed a series of box-office hits throughout New England,
according to sources familiar with the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are looking into whether moviemakers were
forced to hire a local company with alleged ties to organized crime
to provide rental vehicles _ such as wardrobe trailers _ on all
movie sets, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   They are also looking into whether union officials extorted
favors from movie producers and forced them to hire a small group
of hand-selected drivers .
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the grand jury subpoenaed records from Teamsters
Union Local 25, in Charlestown, detailing the union's contracts
with filmmakers of such hits as ``The Perfect Storm,'' ``The Cider
House Rules,'' ``Message in a Bottle'' and ``Good Will Hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, agents from the US Department of Labor's
division of labor and racketeering raided the Weymouth home of
James P. Flynn, the union's transportation coordinator, and seized
records relating to the movie industry, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Local 25 President George Cashman, a longtime fund-raiser for
Governor Paul Cellucci who was recently reappointed to the
Massachusetts Port Authority board of directors for another seven
years, has also come under scrutiny as part of the probe, according
to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Flynn nor his attorney, Richard Egbert, could be reached
for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman Monday acknowledged the federal investigation, saying
that the union's contracts on several past movies had been
subpoenaed. He downplayed the intensity of the investigation,
however, saying federal authorities are ``always looking at the
movie industry. This time it involves us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said he did not know the particulars of the probe, but
when asked about allegations involving Flynn, said, ``I've heard
some scuttlebutt about that, but nothing specific.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was a subject of the investigation, he said,
``Absolutely not. If I am, no one has told me.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is focusing on allegations that the Teamsters
forced producers filming around New England to hire the Location
Connection, a Boston company that provides wardrobe trailers and
other vehicles and is allegedly controlled by Flynn, according to
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the company's workers have links to organized crime in
Charlestown, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also looking into whether Flynn forced movie
producers to hire the same small group of drivers for each movie _
a group he had allegedly hand-picked, according to a source.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of disgruntled Local 25 guys who are
legitimately working and see a handful of guys in the union making
incredible amounts of money on these movie productions when they
film in Boston,'' said a source. ``It's always the same guys who
work on them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Flynn was acquitted of the 1982 gangland slaying of
Brian Halloran, a Winter Hill gang member who was gunned down on
Boston's waterfront after cooperating with the FBI against gangster
James ``Whitey'' Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Flynn, 66, has been back in the limelight as an
actor. He had cameo appearances in ``Cider House Rules'' and ``Good
Will Hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation is being led by the division of labor
and racketeering and the New England Organized Crime Strike Force,
attached to US Attorney Donald K. Stern's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our policy that we can't confirm or deny whether there is
an active investigation,'' said Dennis Kurdek, assistant special
agent in charge of the Department of Labor's Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Martin, a spokeswoman for Stern, declined to comment on
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters Local 25, which supplies the drivers for all films
shot in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine, negotiates
contracts with movie producers over wages _ a figure that can
dramatically impact production costs.
</P>
<P>
   Movie producers have long complained about the cost _ and
aggravation _ they encounter in contracting with Local 25 for
drivers on their movie productions. Under the current contract,
Teamster drivers are paid $2,000 a week for working eight hours a
day in addition to lucrative overtime and fringe benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, as one of a handful of crew chiefs, benefits from a
provision that requires he be paid for every hour that the movie
set is open, even if he is not on the set or no filming is being
done.
</P>
<P>
   One executive, who asked not to be identified, recalled that
Flynn had received weekly paychecks of about $9,000 for several of
the weeks that he had worked on the production of ``Cider House
Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole movie industry is being held hostage in Boston,
that's why they avoid it,'' said a source familiar with the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman butted heads with Warner Bros. executives during the
``Perfect Storm'' negotiations last year, prompting a producer to
fire off an angry letter to Cellucci, complaining that they were
being priced out of Massachusetts by the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   According to the letter, the executive producer complained that
the Teamsters wanted Warner Bros. to pay 72 percent more to some
union drivers than they'd been paid a year earlier when working on
``Message in a Bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Cashman said the increase in wages was justified
and was the first in many years.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci interceded with a call to Cashman and eventually the
Teamsters and Warner Bros. reached an accord, resulting in scenes
from ``The Perfect Storm'' being filmed in Gloucester.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Cellucci led a delegation that included Cashman on a
trade mission to Los Angeles in an effort to convince moviemakers
to film in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   John Birtwell, spokesman for Cellucci, said that the governor's
office was not aware of any federal investigation into the
Teamsters' union. However, he said that a few movie studio
executives had complained to Cellucci about their problems in
dealing with Local 25 but had not produced any evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time Teamsters Local 25 has been investigated
for alleged corruption involving the movie industry. In 1982, two
Local 25 members were convicted for defrauding producers of
Boston-made movies by placing no-shows and fictitious names on
their payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Victimized were producers of the following films made in Boston:
``The Brinks Job,'' produced in 1978 by Dino DeLaurentis;
``Oliver's Story,'' produced by Paramount Pictures in 1978; and
``International Velvet,'' produced by MGM in 1977.

FILMMAKERS CHOOSE LESS COSTLY LOCATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With Movies-Teamsters; a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A movie about playing baseball in the Cape Cod League has been
shot in recent months _ in North Carolina. While the producers of
``Summer Catch'' will be filming scenes on the Cape for a few days
this week, the bulk of the $20 million movie was filmed in
Wilmington, N.C., because of the filmmakers' concerns that they
would face problems with Teamsters' Local 25.
</P>
<P>
   According to several independent and studio filmmakers, dealing
with Local 25, which controls Teamster contracts for movies made in
Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, invariably
presents sizable financial costs as well as aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not worth it,'' said one Warner Bros. executive who
asked not to be identified. ``Their contract is just too expensive
and it's impossible to get them to compromise on anything. It's a
whole lot easier just to go somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official, who tracks the industry nationwide, estimated
that Massachusetts is losing out on as much as 50 percent of the
movie business it could attract because of studios' concerns about
dealing with the Teamsters. Last year, approximately $50 million
was spent in Massachusetts by the filmmaking industry, about half
of what was spent in 1997 when a major production, ``A Civil
Action,'' was filmed here.
</P>
<P>
   George Cashman, president of Local 25, agreed in an interview
Monday that his union does have either the first or second most
lucrative filmmkaking contracts in the nation, in terms of wages
paid to union members.
</P>
<P>
   While he acknowledged that industry executives often complain
about the costs of making films in Massachusetts, Cashman denied
that Local 25 refuses to compromise in negotiating contracts with
the producers of individual films, though he offered no specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are always complaining about the cost of doing business
here, but there's been many times that we've made concessions with
them that they never tell you about,'' Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Bros.' executive said the Teamsters have been
unwilling to compromise on several key contract provisions,
including one that stipulates the number of drivers assigned to
work on sets as well as another that pays crew chiefs whenever the
set is operating, regardless of whether they are needed or if
shooting is being done.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the minute that the coffee gets put on in the morning at
a set, the Teamster drivers are getting paid,'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Movie executives also complained that the members of the
Teamster work crews are often unfamiliar with the sophisticated
equipment that must be moved around a set, but that Local 25
officials have steadfastly refused to allow any Teamster members
from other locals who specialize in such equipment from being
assigned to the set, unless accompanied by a Local 25 member.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros., which is producing ``Summer Catch,'' is not the
only studio to decide in recent months to shoot a movie that has a
decidedly local storyline out of state. Producers of ``Prozac
Nation'' and ``The Harvard Man,'' both of which concern Harvard
University students, decided to do the bulk of their shooting in
Canada, minimizing filming in and around Boston to a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman, who has been president of Local 25 for nine years, said
it is expensive for any enterprise to do business in Massachusetts
and that Local 25 should not be faulted for insisting that
moviemakers pay higher-than-average costs for filming here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very profitable industry,'' Cashman said. ``We are
only asking that our members get their due share.'' If the
situation were as dire as some producers contend, Cashman said,
studios would not continue to do business in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, two comedies _ MGM's ``What's The Worst That Could
Happen'' and the Farrelly Brothers' ``Osmosis Jones'' _ are being
filmed in Boston and Plymouth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Dawson, executive director of the Massachusetts Film
Bureau, acknowledged that some moviemakers wanted to shoot their
films in Massachusetts because the story was centered here but
decided to shoot elsewhere because of problems with the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Location decisions are driven by budget and yes, the Teamster
budget is one of the highest cost elements of a production,''
Dawson said. ``Filmmakers have told me it weighs heavily on whether
a production will decide to shoot here.''
</P>
<P>
   John Birtwell, spokesman for Governor Paul Cellucci, said that
one or two studio executives had complained directly to Cellucci
about the Teamsters when the governor went to Hollywood in 1997 and
again in 1999. Cashman accompanied Cellucci on both trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found more often than not is that it was anecdotal
rather than anything pervasive,'' said Birtwell. ``There seems to
be a lot of talk without much hard evidence.''

 &HT;    GRAPEVINE: News, gossip from the wrestling industry
 &HT;    By John Allen

<TEXT>
<P>
   The World Wrestling Federation's ``Fully Loaded'' pay-per-view
looked like it left the WWF's talent shelf unloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal matches, Triple H vs. Chris Jericho, Rikishi vs. Val
Venis and The Rock vs. Chris Benoit, looked to take a toll on the
WWF roster. But The Rock and Benoit were back out in the ring on
Monday. And with the return of the Big Show and the increased use
of Kurt Angle, it looks like the WWF has again weathered a
physically demanding pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   One loss they may not be able to avoid is Triple H. He has been
working as the top heel for more than three year. If nothing else,
it would benefit him to take a month off and the WWF has been
working its angle so he could leave for a month and they could
carry on with Benoit and Angle taking over top heel status.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of that duel, teaming the Big Show with them could be a
stroke of genius. Since jumping from the WCW over a year ago, the
Big Show has not found theperfect gimmick. Because of his size, he
must be a heel and teamed with the newest top heels, he should
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   WCW executives must cringe when looking at the WWF roster.
Former WCW wrestlers Benoit, Jericho, Big Show, Saturn and Eddy
Guerrero are all in contention for titles or big pushes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reports on the internet have Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff
booking WCW ``Thunder'' shows and Vince Russo booking ``Nitro''
shows. Not true, as Russo is still handling most of the booking
duties with right-hand man Terry Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   _ According to reports from fans at Monday's ``Nitro,'' when the
show went off of the air Goldberg left the ring just holding his
arm as though he was injured. Not good news for WCW. Especially,
with Scott Steiner and Kevin Nash are missing ``Nitro,'' WCW needs
all its weapons to continue its battle with WWF. Steiner is not
injured, he is still on his honeymoon (he was married Friday),
which pushed back last week to work WCW television.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking of getting married, The Undertaker got married on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Diamond Dallas Page made some noise last week about WCW not
using him because of his age. The 44-year-old is listed on upcoming
house show booking sheets, but not for television. Many in WCW
believe that Page came up with the idea for the ``Positively''
Kanyon gimmick as a way to keep him in the minds of viewers.
Kanyon, a longtime friend of page, enjoys the gimmick and should
face Page in a pay-per-view when Page returns.
</P>
<P>
   _ A wrestler without a home, Randy Savage, was on a Providence,
R.I., radio station last week. He said he is between contracts and
is trying to decide between the WWF and WCW. The 45-year-old said
that he is not too old for wrestling because he hasn't made it to
the top yet. He also said that he will be making a shocking
announcement in the near future. Yeah, probably that he's going to
drop his asking price so he can get some work.
</P>
<P>
   _ WWF talent man Jim Ross touted Ron Waterman as an intriguing
prospect in his most recent ``Ross Report.'' At 6-foot-2 and 260
pounds, Waterman has an amateur wrestling and mixed martial arts
background that could help him rise through the ranks quickly.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the WWF injury front, Billy Gunn's return date has been
moved up to September. The orginal diagnosis for the torn rotator
cuff from October at best.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect to see Tazz get a chance at the Intercontential title
soon. Also, Trish Stratus days with T&AMP;A are number. She will be the
exclusive valet of Val Venis soon.

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Here I have been happily living without kids,
and now I find out I'm supposed to be angry and militant about it.
To add to this country's surplus of movements, America now has a
child-free movement.
</P>
<P>
   And I just thought I was part of a pro-dog movement, one that
liberated me from worries about child care and schooling. I can
stay up as late as I want, and wake up at a civilized hour, and
never have to sock piles of money away for tuition or buying my
16-year-old a car.
</P>
<P>
   My oldest dog is 16, in people years, but he isn't getting a
Jetta or taking the College Boards.
</P>
<P>
   So what am I supposed to be mad about? The fact that parents of
real children get a few tax credits here and there?
</P>
<P>
   My dogs don't get the $500 tax deduction given each dependent,
but they never outgrow their clothes, they never need more than a
bowl of dried rice and animal parts each day, and when I go to work
they can be locked unsupervised in the house without child
protection agencies locking me away.
</P>
<P>
   Am I supposed to be upset about the so-called
``family-friendly'' workplace, which provides day care and generous
leave arrangements for parents?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, I haven't seen such a workplace, although my home
newspaper is pretty good with pregnancy leave and part-time work
schedules for parents, and occasionally lets them bring in kids on
days when the child care arrangements fall through. This is very
healthy for children, because they quickly get bored and decide not
to go into the newspaper business.
</P>
<P>
   As a former teacher, I'm prejudiced in favor of children, and
have no wish to live in an environment free of them, except when
they're screaming. My wife is more adamantly anti-child, so much so
that she had a tubal ligation at 23. We regularly argue about
whether people without children have an obligation to support the
propagation of the species.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say she's not as big on our species as I am.
</P>
<P>
   It's some parents I don't like. If I had any use for movements,
I'd start the overindulgent-parent-free movement.
</P>
<P>
   Go anywhere and you'll see these parents acting out, and the
richer the place you go, the more you'll see terrible parental
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   When we're in stores, on airplanes or in fast food restaurants,
we expect to see young children, and we further expect some of them
will start screaming, bawling or running around. We expect the
parents will feel harried, and we'll feel sorry for them.
</P>
<P>
   What's unacceptable is if parents ignore their kids' behavior,
and act as if strangers should feel privileged to be overrun and
deafened by such charming little geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ever try telling one of those precious children to desist.
Then the parent will get in your face to protect the child's First
Amendment rights to scream in your ear.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is harder to take when the overindulgent parent tries
to discipline the child. What he or she does is kneel down, look
the precious one calmly in the eye and try to reason with the
unreasonable forces of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we talked about this before, didn't we, Max?'' says the
parent, as if the child would remember any discussion at an early
and pitiless Piagetian stage. ``We agreed you wouldn't kick
strangers in the knees, didn't we?''
</P>
<P>
   Almost always, the parent makes indirect requests in the form of
tag questions, which children don't understand nearly as well as a
good sharp ``No.'' But no, the overindulgent parent believes the
child is on the fast track to Harvard, and already has mastered
logic and ethics.
</P>
<P>
   The overindulgent parent is very concerned with that fast track
to Harvard, and indulgence verges on abuse as parents make their
children run on that track like rats.
</P>
<P>
   First the kids get their Playskool toy computers, then real ones
so they're well on their way to repetitive stress injury and
geekdom. Then they start taking practice SAT tests in elementary
school, often a school where recess has been abolished because
parents decided it's a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   In high school the parents hire consultants to advise the kids
on how to make themselves more attractive to colleges by
diversifying their portfolios. ``Sorry, all that soccer practice
your parents drove you to was a waste of time. Take up lacrosse.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the consultants ghost-write the college applications, and
if all goes well, the kids can head off to the college of their
parents' choice in the cars their parents bought them.
</P>
<P>
   All people want their children to have a better life, but I'm
not sure these kids are getting it. A job, to them, isn't mowing
lawns. It's something you get after getting an MBA. Sports aren't
for fun. They're for being No. 1, and we talked about how you have
to practice lacrosse five hours a day, didn't we?
</P>
<P>
   But kids can survive all kinds of childhoods, and I'm sure they
can survive overindulgent parents, and become productive citizens
helping to support me and my dogs in our old age.

 &HT;    JOURNAL: IN MOSCOW, COLD WATER -- NOT COLD WAR -- THREATENS
 &HT;    With photo mug of Coker available.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The menace returns, like clockwork, as soon as the
weather warms in Moscow, gripping Russia's capital in panicky
bursts of conversation about who has found the small, handwritten
note that marks you as the next victim of the cold water creep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wait in dread. It's like a mad serial killer stalking town.
You never know when you and your family are next,'' says Marina
Kazakova, the 73-year-old mother of one of my Russian friends.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer the hot water in this city of 10 million is turned
off, district by district, block by block, for almost one month at
a time, so that workers can examine the steel pipes responsible for
transporting people's bath water, dishwater and drinking water and
replace them if they are leaky or rusty.
</P>
<P>
   It's an annual tradition that I remember from my first visit to
the Soviet Union in 1986. Then, I thought it was an exotic learning
experience, and after my 21-day trip, I went back to my parent's
home in Oklahoma City for a long, hot soak in the tub.
</P>
<P>
   The fun evaporated on my next trip, when I studied at a
university in the Russian Far East in 1991. At that time, my
Russian roommate and I would come home from classes, stand outside
our dormitory and count which floors the light was on. When there
was light on our floor, there would be hot water. When there
wasn't, Rita and I would walk over to a friend's home for the
evening, cursing the sadistic bureaucrat who had flipped the switch
again.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, names my friends hurl at the head of Moscow's
utility system, the department in charge of heat, electricity gas
and sewage, when they wake up that fateful morning to only cold
water are strong enough to make your hair stand on end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clock that devil for me,'' my friend Natasha Petrovna told me
when I told her who was going to meet last week. ``Tell him he's a
murderer. Last summer both my husband and my grandbaby got sick
taking cold showers!''
</P>
<P>
   When I walked into his office, Mikhail Lapir, the 86-year-old
head of the city's public works, hardly resembled the horned
misanthrope we imagined him to be. The sprightly engineer looks
more like a trim Santa Claus, except for the drawn look of remorse
on his face that tells a listener that he actually does feel your
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine walking up the stairs to your apartment and your
neighbors giving you looks that pierce your heart. For those 23
days, how can I relax?'' he says, sighing deeply in his cavernous
office in downtown Moscow that is adorned with nothing except an
equally enormous map of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want explanations when they long for a hot
bath,'' he says. ``They complain, and complain. It's a cry from the
soul, and after hot, sweaty weekends, it becomes a cry from other
parts of the body, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's heat and hot water system came on line in 1924, as part
of Stalin's push to modernize life in Russia. After the dictator
died, few upgrades to the system were made.
</P>
<P>
   Today, like then, most of the city's hot water comes from the
town's electric power stations. The steam used to run the
electricity-producing turbines is redirected to heat water, which
is then piped through a 9,000-mile-long centralized pipe system to
people's kitchen and bathroom faucets. The hot water travels at
near-boiling temperatures, which requires a whole section to be
turned off and cooled before any work can be done.
</P>
<P>
   While he doesn't defend the system, Lapir, who started work at
the city utility company more than 50 years ago, knows it inside
and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a model of collectivization when it was built,'' says
the director, whose clear, blue eyes matched the color of his tie,
which was given to him by his colleagues on his last birthday. ``It
was, and still is, highly efficient and very cheap. But it's also a
real monster, when there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat and water system was built very quickly, with little
thought given to the length of time needed for maintenance, he
said. Moscow only has one diagnostic tool, an expensive
computerized piece of machinery, that allows workers to locate
leaky sections of pipe without turning the system off.
</P>
<P>
   Because the same system heats radiators and buildings in the
winter, the only time to turn off the system is the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people would really have my head if this system broke down
in the depths of winter. People actually would die then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of living a quiet life in retirement, like other men his
age, Lapir says he won't stop working until he gets a new heating
system installed around the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a dream,'' he says. ``I dream that some day we won't
have to switch it off for so long. That would make me feel my life
was worth something.''
</P>
<P>
   I've been in Russia long enough to know that change doesn't
happen very fast, but at least I'll escape the cold water this
year. Lapir let it slip that my neighborhood's hot water would be
turned off the first week of August, and I've re-arranged my
vacation accordingly.

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Bands of heavily armed guerrillas and
right-wing paramilitary groups roam the countryside, warring
against each other over ideology and control of the illegal drug
trade. Rural peasants, caught in the middle, have fled by the
thousands, their homes destroyed, businesses ruined, their children
lured or taken at gunpoint to join the groups of fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The large cities appear tranquil, but with Colombia suffering
the highest rate of kidnapping in the world, pedestrians hurry
along, never entirely sure they are safe. The rich hire bodyguards
and ride in armor-plated vehicles, while many in the middle class
hope to flee the country. The poor get by as best they can.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is a nation living in fear and uncertainty. Peace talks
to end the 36-year-old civil war are underway in Switzerland, but
so far there has been little progress.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is suffering through its worst downturn in 70 years,
with official unemployment topping 20 percent and unofficial
estimates doubling that number.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian President Andres Pastrana has launched a bold new
initiative called ``Plan Colombia,'' which hinges on $1.3 billion
in American aid, most of it destined for military hardware to fight
the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   But doubts about the plan abound within Colombia. Critics fear
it will only trigger an escalation of the war, along with a new
wave of internal displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the problems, average Colombians go on with their lives,
looking for work, struggling to hold onto their jobs, hoping for a
better future for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Few are untouched by the country's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The following stories give brief glimpses into the fears that
grip many Colombians' lives.

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Libia Barahona remembers the day clearly _ a
Tuesday in July of 1998 _ when the sound of the trucks echoed
through her small town of Mapiripan(CQ), a remote village 200 miles
southeast of Colombia's capital of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks carried about 100 armed members of a paramilitary
group, who had come looking for leftist sympathizers _ families
whose sons or fathers might be supporters of the Marxist rebels
trying to overthrow the Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rounded up everybody at 5:30 a.m.,'' said Barahona, 60, a
widowed mother of five who ran a small restaurant and store. ``They
stuck a machine gun in my chest and asked where the guerrillas and
the guns were. I told them I didn't know anything about this.''
</P>
<P>
   With no police and no army soldiers around, the paramilitaries
had their way in remote Mapiripan for weeks. Suspected informants
and sympathizers were rounded up, questioned and beaten, their
hands tied behind their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Barahona, her children and the rest of the townspeople were told
to stay in their homes with the windows closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were torturing and killing people,'' she recalled. ``We
couldn't even count the number of the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In war-torn Colombia, Barahona's story is all too common.
Colombia's military has ceded huge swaths of the countryside to the
guerrillas or right-wing paramilitary gangs. Both groups sweep
through rural towns looking for recruits and enemies, conducting a
reign of terror funded by tribute they collect from Colombia's drug
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle are poor campesinos like Barahona, most of
whom hide any political opinions they might have in a desperate bid
for survival. Whipsawed between the warring parties, many wind up
fleeing the countryside, heading for the larger cities.
</P>
<P>
   Official government figures list more than 1 million Colombians
as displaced from their homes in the past five years, but human
rights advocates say the number of ``desplazados'' _ the displaced
_ is closer to 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war has spread over the last two years to areas not
traditionally affected,'' said Albeiro Salazar, a researcher at the
Center for Investigation and Education, a human rights group based
in Bogota. ``The guerrillas and the paramilitaries want the civil
population to take sides, and they enforce their will through
massacres and torture. Now we have whole regions of the countryside
that are depopulated.''
</P>
<P>
   While the poor have fled within Colombia's borders, the
better-off have fled the country altogether. As Colombia's woes
have grown, they have formed long lines outside foreign embassies,
applying for visas to move to Spain, Canada, the United States,
Costa Rica and other nations. There are fears that Colombia is
losing its professional class of doctors, lawyers, engineers and
business owners.
</P>
<P>
   But for the poor like Barahona, the only escape is a bus ticket
to Bogota, Medellin or the like. Hoping to find work in the
relative peace of the cities, many stumble from the crisis of the
countryside into lives of poverty and homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Few can find work; Colombia is now enduring its worst economic
crisis of the last 70 years, with official unemployment topping 20
percent and unofficial estimates ranging up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not used to living in the city,'' Barahona said recently
as she stood aimlessly outside a building she has occupied with
more than 100 other displaced people. ``I feel trapped here. Where
I lived before, I knew everybody. Here, the rich people walk past
and insult us. We want to work and get on with our lives, but there
are no jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Barahona now spends her days looking for work, applying for
government assistance and hoping something will happen. Her nights
are spent reliving the terror of the past few years, longing for a
home she fears she will never see again.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the second of August, 1998, the guerrillas arrived and
there was a terrible shoot-out,'' she said. ``The paramilitaries
were dug in beside our house and the shooting went on for hours. It
started at 2 a.m. and went on until the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Huddling in her house with her children, Barahona eventually
escaped during a lull in the shooting, running for the nearby
woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back two days later and everything from the store and
restaurant was stolen,'' she said. ``I saw more than 40 dead,
guerrillas and paramilitary.''
</P>
<P>
   Shocked townspeople buried their dead and tried to go on, but
the war wouldn't leave them alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Nov. 3, the guerrillas came again and they killed three
young boys they said were accomplices of the paramilitaries,'' she
said. ``They told us then to leave or die. We left with just the
clothes we were wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   After living several months in a nearby town, Barahona returned
to Mapiripan yet again when she heard that things had quieted down.
This time she stayed until the guerrillas returned in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted my three oldest children,'' she said. ``They
wanted them to join the fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   This time she fled all the way to Bogota, only to find thousands
of other refugees like herself, homeless and desperate for work.
</P>
<P>
   Barahona knows little of plans by Colombia's President, Andres
Pastrana, to fight the drug lords _ and the guerrillas that prey on
them _ with nearly $2 billion in foreign aid _ more than $1 billion
from the United States. She doesn't know that critics fear the
plans will just lead to a huge new wave of displacement of poor
peasants like herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fear is that this plan will make the war intensify and
will create more forced displacement,'' said Salazar, the human
rights investigator. ``It's a military plan that does very little
in the way of social investment that is needed to fight the
underlying causes of the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Barahona hopes only to find work, a home, some way out of the
living nightmare her life has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no place to go,'' she said.

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The families arrive each Friday afternoon,
standing quietly in the dim hallway of Radio Nacional de Colombia,
faces etched with sadness and tension.
</P>
<P>
   Most clutch handwritten notes they will soon read into the
microphone, while others cluster in a corner or near the stairway,
whispering among themselves and scribbling words of hope tinged
with pain.
</P>
<P>
   Torn by civil war, drug trafficking and a terrible crime wave,
Colombia has the highest kidnapping rate in the world, with nearly
3,000 reported victims last year.
</P>
<P>
   The crime has become so common in this nation of 39 million that
several radio stations now broadcast messages each week from
families hoping to reach their missing loved-ones. Many may never
know if the messages are heard, but they come anyway because they
don't know what else to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps because you feel you are doing something,'' said
Deisy Gonzalez Castillo, 30, a Bogota lawyer whose uncle was
kidnapped in April. ``We never thought this would happen to us. It
leaves you so upset. You can't eat or sleep and you get
bad-tempered. You just want to go outside and run away.''
</P>
<P>
   While the drug war and the civil war have paralyzed parts of
Colombia, the wave of kidnapping _ an average of eight people per
day _ has touched nearly everyone here: rich and poor, rural
peasants and the urban middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a business,'' said Olga Lucia Gomez, a
psychologist who works with ``Pais Libre'' _ ``Free Country'' _ a
group that aids families of the victims and has organized a
national campaign against kidnapping. ``But the impact is brutal.
It's like ripples in a pond when you throw in a stone. The victim
is damaged, his family is damaged, their friends are damaged and
all of society is damaged. It breaks down trust and creates
chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the crimes are committed by Colombia's leftist
guerrilla and right-wing paramilitary groups, which use the ransoms
to fund their armies. Common criminals also nab people, often
selling their victims to the guerrillas or paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Ransoms range from a few hundred dollars to hundreds of
thousands. Families are forced to sell their homes and businesses
and borrow every peso they can find, while businesses are extorted
for the return of their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Most shocking to many is that of the 2,945 kidnap victims in
1999, 7 percent were children.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's government has recently made the kidnapping of
children a major issue in its talks with the leading guerrilla
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The
group's leaders have denied taking children, but defend kidnapping
as a legitimate means to fund their 36-year-old insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Deisy Castillo family is typical of the victims. Her uncle,
Silvio Castillo, wasn't a guerilla or a paramilitary. He wasn't
political at all, and he certainly wasn't rich.
</P>
<P>
   A truck driver, he was on a routine trip from Bogota to Medellin
to deliver auto parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A jeep cut him off and men got out with guns,'' said Deisy
Castillo. ``Another driver who was ahead of him saw it happen. We
have heard nothing from Silvio or the kidnappers since he was
taken. They never found his truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Families often wait for months before a ransom note arrives _ a
tactic that increases the pressure, leaving them desperate and
willing to pay whatever it takes to recover their loved one.
</P>
<P>
   Many report their loss to the National Police, but often little
can be done but wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't express the pain you're feeling, and how can you
expect anyone to understand?'' said Sylvia Lopez, 36, whose brother
Jorge disappeared in May 1999 while driving a delivery route in
Bogota. ``These kidnappers are people without hearts or
consciences.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are happy moments when families are reunited. Just
recently, the radio station was buoyed by visits from four released
victims, who came to encourage the families with loved ones still
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept me with a rope around my neck and my hands tied, all
day and all night,'' said Nidia Velazco, who was held for six
months. ``It was the FARC. They didn't treat me badly, but they
watched us and kept us tied up even when we went to the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian government estimates that in 1999 68 percent of
kidnapping victims were released after ransoms were paid, 26
percent were rescued and 6 percent were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Velazco was kept in a house in the mountains outside Bogota with
several other victims. Meeting with the wives of two kidnapped men
after her release, she gave them encouraging details, describing
their health, eating habits and long hair from months without
visiting a barber.
</P>
<P>
   The wives of the missing men listened intently to every detail,
often laughing and making jokes. But the warm scene was etched with
uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, the psychologist, worries that the crime has become so
common that Colombians now simply accept it as a normal part of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks it's just the rich who are the -----------

&HT;     THE REAL CULPRITS BEHIND UNITED'S FLIGHT DELAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The angry quotes are predictable from business
and vacation travelers stranded or delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Someone with a notebook or microphone asks what the travelers
think of the particular labor action _ by pilots, flight attendants
or maintenance workers _ that CAUSED their delayed or canceled
flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't print (or put on TV) what I think,'' is the general
hostile theme. ``I don't care what their complaints are. Right now,
I think they should all be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Just once, I'd love to hear the question asked from a different
point of view. For example:
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think of the invisible corporate management team
that has CAUSED your delay _ those high-paid folks who have dragged
their feet for months, engaging in half-baked negotiations and
knowing full-well that X,000 pilots (or flight attendants or
mechanics) are coming to the end of their labor contract?''
</P>
<P>
   At the least, it would be refreshing to hear BOTH sides of a
labor dispute get dissed for wrecking the travel plans of thousands
of ``consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, it takes two entities to cause a labor dispute, two
to lead to a strike or work slow-down.
</P>
<P>
   But in so many labor-management fights, the only side that gets
blamed is the one whose members are out in public, not the one
whose proponents sit in board rooms and behind closed mahogany
doors.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the public villains have been the pilots and
mechanics of United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   All U.S. airlines have had a rough summer because of unusually
bad weather and high jet fuel costs, but United has been in the
news the most often.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the most recent month for which the Department of
Transportation has figures, United's on-time performance was a
dismal 57 percent. In nearly every news report in print or the
electronic media, most of the blame has been heaped on United's
pilots and maintenance crews.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 12, pilots have refused to work overtime, sending
the airline's complex scheduling into low-grade crisis. Since July
12, mechanics have followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   United's pilots have been working without a contract since April
12; the mechanics' contract expired July 12. Most news reports
contain but a throwaway line about this, as though an expired
contract were insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   An expired contract means employees continue working under the
same conditions _ for the same money and benefits _ they've worked
under for the past several years. It means a kind of financial
freeze, but one that's good news for company management while it
penalizes union employees.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, UAL Corp. will settle on new contracts with its
pilots and maintenance workers, no doubt giving raises to members
of both unions. In the ensuing months, however, management will be
using that large chunk of salary increase cash to make money.
United's pilots and mechanics meanwhile will be in economic statis,
paying their bills from salaries they negotiated years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, United is in the throes of a typical
labor-management tug of war. Corporate execs are playing it smart
by delaying a final contract and the unions are using a classic
labor tool to try to force management to settle _ i.e., refusing to
work overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Although United is an employee-owned airline, it is a public
company, and 45 percent of its stock is owned by non-employees.
United's second-quarter earnings were technically down from last
year _ $336 million from $637 million _ but the 1999 figure
includes a one-time only gain of $428 million from United's sale of
its holdings in another company.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: UAL Corp.'s second-quarter earnings were up from
$244 million last year to $374 million this year. Second-quarter
revenue increased from $4.54 billion to $5.11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In May, UAL announced a multibillion-dollar plan to take over
the nation's sixth-largest airline, U.S. Airways. Conveniently, its
president, Rakesh Gangwal, is a former United executive who worked
closely for years with United's president, Rono Dutto. Both men
went to the same university in India. Gangwal got his master's
degree in business administration from Wharton, Dutto took his at
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Next time your United flight gets delayed or cancelled, why not
add Rono and Rakesh to the list of folks who've CAUSED your
inconvenience? It's only fair.

 &HT;    JOURNAL: IN MOSCOW, COLD WATER -- NOT COLD WAR -- THREATENS
 &HT;    With photo mug of Coker available.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The menace returns, like clockwork, as soon as the
weather warms in Moscow, gripping Russia's capital in panicky
bursts of conversation about who has found the small, handwritten
note that marks you as the next victim of the cold water creep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wait in dread. It's like a mad serial killer stalking town.
You never know when you and your family are next,'' says Marina
Kazakova, the 73-year-old mother of one of my Russian friends.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer the hot water in this city of 10 million is turned
off, district by district, block by block, for almost one month at
a time, so that workers can examine the steel pipes responsible for
transporting people's bath water, dishwater and drinking water and
replace them if they are leaky or rusty.
</P>
<P>
   It's an annual tradition that I remember from my first visit to
the Soviet Union in 1986. Then, I thought it was an exotic learning
experience, and after my 21-day trip, I went back to my parent's
home in Oklahoma City for a long, hot soak in the tub.
</P>
<P>
   The fun evaporated on my next trip, when I studied at a
university in the Russian Far East in 1991. At that time, my
Russian roommate and I would come home from classes, stand outside
our dormitory and count which floors the light was on. When there
was light on our floor, there would be hot water. When there
wasn't, Rita and I would walk over to a friend's home for the
evening, cursing the sadistic bureaucrat who had flipped the switch
again.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, names my friends hurl at the head of Moscow's
utility system, the department in charge of heat, electricity gas
and sewage, when they wake up that fateful morning to only cold
water are strong enough to make your hair stand on end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clock that devil for me,'' my friend Natasha Petrovna told me
when I told her who was going to meet last week. ``Tell him he's a
murderer. Last summer both my husband and my grandbaby got sick
taking cold showers!''
</P>
<P>
   When I walked into his office, Mikhail Lapir, the 86-year-old
head of the city's public works, hardly resembled the horned
misanthrope we imagined him to be. The sprightly engineer looks
more like a trim Santa Claus, except for the drawn look of remorse
on his face that tells a listener that he actually does feel your
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine walking up the stairs to your apartment and your
neighbors giving you looks that pierce your heart. For those 23
days, how can I relax?'' he says, sighing deeply in his cavernous
office in downtown Moscow that is adorned with nothing except an
equally enormous map of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want explanations when they long for a hot
bath,'' he says. ``They complain, and complain. It's a cry from the
soul, and after hot, sweaty weekends, it becomes a cry from other
parts of the body, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's heat and hot water system came on line in 1924, as part
of Stalin's push to modernize life in Russia. After the dictator
died, few upgrades to the system were made.
</P>
<P>
   Today, like then, most of the city's hot water comes from the
town's electric power stations. The steam used to run the
electricity-producing turbines is redirected to heat water, which
is then piped through a 9,000-mile-long centralized pipe system to
people's kitchen and bathroom faucets. The hot water travels at
near-boiling temperatures, which requires a whole section to be
turned off and cooled before any work can be done.
</P>
<P>
   While he doesn't defend the system, Lapir, who started work at
the city utility company more than 50 years ago, knows it inside
and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a model of collectivization when it was built,'' says
the director, whose clear, blue eyes matched the color of his tie,
which was given to him by his colleagues on his last birthday. ``It
was, and still is, highly efficient and very cheap. But it's also a
real monster, when there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat and water system was built very quickly, with little
thought given to the length of time needed for maintenance, he
said. Moscow only has one diagnostic tool, an expensive
computerized piece of machinery, that allows workers to locate
leaky sections of pipe without turning the system off.
</P>
<P>
   Because the same system heats radiators and buildings in the
winter, the only time to turn off the system is the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people would really have my head if this system broke down
in the depths of winter. People actually would die then,'' he said.
</P>

   Instead of living a quiet life in retirement, like other men his
age, Lapir says he won't stop working until he gets a new heating
system installed around the city.

<P>
   ``I have a dream,'' he says. ``I dream that some day we won't
have to switch it off for so long. That would make me feel my life
was worth something.''
</P>
<P>
   I've been in Russia long enough to know that change doesn't
happen very fast, but at least I'll escape the cold water this
year. Lapir let it slip that my neighborhood's hot water would be
turned off the first week of August, and I've re-arranged my
vacation accordingly.

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Bands of heavily armed guerrillas and
right-wing paramilitary groups roam the countryside, warring
against each other over ideology and control of the illegal drug
trade. Rural peasants, caught in the middle, have fled by the
thousands, their homes destroyed, businesses ruined, their children
lured or taken at gunpoint to join the groups of fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The large cities appear tranquil, but with Colombia suffering
the highest rate of kidnapping in the world, pedestrians hurry
along, never entirely sure they are safe. The rich hire bodyguards
and ride in armor-plated vehicles, while many in the middle class
hope to flee the country. The poor get by as best they can.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is a nation living in fear and uncertainty. Peace talks
to end the 36-year-old civil war are underway in Switzerland, but
so far there has been little progress.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is suffering through its worst downturn in 70 years,
with official unemployment topping 20 percent and unofficial
estimates doubling that number.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian President Andres Pastrana has launched a bold new
initiative called ``Plan Colombia,'' which hinges on $1.3 billion
in American aid, most of it destined for military hardware to fight
the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   But doubts about the plan abound within Colombia. Critics fear
it will only trigger an escalation of the war, along with a new
wave of internal displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the problems, average Colombians go on with their lives,
looking for work, struggling to hold onto their jobs, hoping for a
better future for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Few are untouched by the country's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The following stories give brief glimpses into the fears that
grip many Colombians' lives.

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Libia Barahona remembers the day clearly _ a
Tuesday in July of 1998 _ when the sound of the trucks echoed
through her small town of Mapiripan(CQ), a remote village 200 miles
southeast of Colombia's capital of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks carried about 100 armed members of a paramilitary
group, who had come looking for leftist sympathizers _ families
whose sons or fathers might be supporters of the Marxist rebels
trying to overthrow the Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rounded up everybody at 5:30 a.m.,'' said Barahona, 60, a
widowed mother of five who ran a small restaurant and store. ``They
stuck a machine gun in my chest and asked where the guerrillas and
the guns were. I told them I didn't know anything about this.''
</P>
<P>
   With no police and no army soldiers around, the paramilitaries
had their way in remote Mapiripan for weeks. Suspected informants
and sympathizers were rounded up, questioned and beaten, their
hands tied behind their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Barahona, her children and the rest of the townspeople were told
to stay in their homes with the windows closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were torturing and killing people,'' she recalled. ``We
couldn't even count the number of the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In war-torn Colombia, Barahona's story is all too common.
Colombia's military has ceded huge swaths of the countryside to the
guerrillas or right-wing paramilitary gangs. Both groups sweep
through rural towns looking for recruits and enemies, conducting a
reign of terror funded by tribute they collect from Colombia's drug
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle are poor campesinos like Barahona, most of
whom hide any political opinions they might have in a desperate bid
for survival. Whipsawed between the warring parties, many wind up
fleeing the countryside, heading for the larger cities.
</P>
<P>
   Official government figures list more than 1 million Colombians
as displaced from their homes in the past five years, but human
rights advocates say the number of ``desplazados'' _ the displaced
_ is closer to 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war has spread over the last two years to areas not
traditionally affected,'' said Albeiro Salazar, a researcher at the
Center for Investigation and Education, a human rights group based
in Bogota. ``The guerrillas and the paramilitaries want the civil
population to take sides, and they enforce their will through
massacres and torture. Now we have whole regions of the countryside
that are depopulated.''
</P>
<P>
   While the poor have fled within Colombia's borders, the
better-off have fled the country altogether. As Colombia's woes
have grown, they have formed long lines outside foreign embassies,
applying for visas to move to Spain, Canada, the United States,
Costa Rica and other nations. There are fears that Colombia is
losing its professional class of doctors, lawyers, engineers and
business owners.
</P>
<P>
   But for the poor like Barahona, the only escape is a bus ticket
to Bogota, Medellin or the like. Hoping to find work in the
relative peace of the cities, many stumble from the crisis of the
countryside into lives of poverty and homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Few can find work; Colombia is now enduring its worst economic
crisis of the last 70 years, with official unemployment topping 20
percent and unofficial estimates ranging up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not used to living in the city,'' Barahona said recently
as she stood aimlessly outside a building she has occupied with
more than 100 other displaced people. ``I feel trapped here. Where
I lived before, I knew everybody. Here, the rich people walk past
and insult us. We want to work and get on with our lives, but there
are no jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Barahona now spends her days looking for work, applying for
government assistance and hoping something will happen. Her nights
are spent reliving the terror of the past few years, longing for a
home she fears she will never see again.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the second of August, 1998, the guerrillas arrived and
there was a terrible shoot-out,'' she said. ``The paramilitaries
were dug in beside our house and the shooting went on for hours. It
started at 2 a.m. and went on until the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Huddling in her house with her children, Barahona eventually
escaped during a lull in the shooting, running for the nearby
woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back two days later and everything from the store and
restaurant was stolen,'' she said. ``I saw more than 40 dead,
guerrillas and paramilitary.''
</P>
<P>
   Shocked townspeople buried their dead and tried to go on, but
the war wouldn't leave them alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Nov. 3, the guerrillas came again and they killed three
young boys they said were accomplices of the paramilitaries,'' she
said. ``They told us then to leave or die. We left with just the
clothes we were wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   After living several months in a nearby town, Barahona returned
to Mapiripan yet again when she heard that things had quieted down.
This time she stayed until the guerrillas returned in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted my three oldest children,'' she said. ``They
wanted them to join the fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   This time she fled all the way to Bogota, only to find thousands
of other refugees like herself, homeless and desperate for work.
</P>
<P>
   Barahona knows little of plans by Colombia's President, Andres
Pastrana, to fight the drug lords _ and the guerrillas that prey on
them _ with nearly $2 billion in foreign aid _ more than $1 billion
from the United States. She doesn't know that critics fear the
plans will just lead to a huge new wave of displacement of poor
peasants like herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fear is that this plan will make the war intensify and
will create more forced displacement,'' said Salazar, the human
rights investigator. ``It's a military plan that does very little
in the way of social investment that is needed to fight the
underlying causes of the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Barahona hopes only to find work, a home, some way out of the
living nightmare her life has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no place to go,'' she said.

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The families arrive each Friday afternoon,
standing quietly in the dim hallway of Radio Nacional de Colombia,
faces etched with sadness and tension.
</P>
<P>
   Most clutch handwritten notes they will soon read into the
microphone, while others cluster in a corner or near the stairway,
whispering among themselves and scribbling words of hope tinged
with pain.
</P>
<P>
   Torn by civil war, drug trafficking and a terrible crime wave,
Colombia has the highest kidnapping rate in the world, with nearly
3,000 reported victims last year.
</P>
<P>
   The crime has become so common in this nation of 39 million that
several radio stations now broadcast messages each week from
families hoping to reach their missing loved-ones. Many may never
know if the messages are heard, but they come anyway because they
don't know what else to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps because you feel you are doing something,'' said
Deisy Gonzalez Castillo, 30, a Bogota lawyer whose uncle was
kidnapped in April. ``We never thought this would happen to us. It
leaves you so upset. You can't eat or sleep and you get
bad-tempered. You just want to go outside and run away.''
</P>
<P>
   While the drug war and the civil war have paralyzed parts of
Colombia, the wave of kidnapping _ an average of eight people per
day _ has touched nearly everyone here: rich and poor, rural
peasants and the urban middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a business,'' said Olga Lucia Gomez, a
psychologist who works with ``Pais Libre'' _ ``Free Country'' _ a
group that aids families of the victims and has organized a
national campaign against kidnapping. ``But the impact is brutal.
It's like ripples in a pond when you throw in a stone. The victim
is damaged, his family is damaged, their friends are damaged and
all of society is damaged. It breaks down trust and creates
chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the crimes are committed by Colombia's leftist
guerrilla and right-wing paramilitary groups, which use the ransoms
to fund their armies. Common criminals also nab people, often
selling their victims to the guerrillas or paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Ransoms range from a few hundred dollars to hundreds of
thousands. Families are forced to sell their homes and businesses
and borrow every peso they can find, while businesses are extorted
for the return of their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Most shocking to many is that of the 2,945 kidnap victims in
1999, 7 percent were children.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's government has recently made the kidnapping of
children a major issue in its talks with the leading guerrilla
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The
group's leaders have denied taking children, but defend kidnapping
as a legitimate means to fund their 36-year-old insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Deisy Castillo family is typical of the victims. Her uncle,
Silvio Castillo, wasn't a guerilla or a paramilitary. He wasn't
political at all, and he certainly wasn't rich.
</P>
<P>
   A truck driver, he was on a routine trip from Bogota to Medellin
to deliver auto parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A jeep cut him off and men got out with guns,'' said Deisy
Castillo. ``Another driver who was ahead of him saw it happen. We
have heard nothing from Silvio or the kidnappers since he was
taken. They never found his truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Families often wait for months before a ransom note arrives _ a
tactic that increases the pressure, leaving them desperate and
willing to pay whatever it takes to recover their loved one.
</P>
<P>
   Many report their loss to the National Police, but often little
can be done but wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't express the pain you're feeling, and how can you
expect anyone to understand?'' said Sylvia Lopez, 36, whose brother
Jorge disappeared in May 1999 while driving a delivery route in
Bogota. ``These kidnappers are people without hearts or
consciences.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are happy moments when families are reunited. Just
recently, the radio station was buoyed by visits from four released
victims, who came to encourage the families with loved ones still
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept me with a rope around my neck and my hands tied, all
day and all night,'' said Nidia Velazco, who was held for six
months. ``It was the FARC. They didn't treat me badly, but they
watched us and kept us tied up even when we went to the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian government estimates that in 1999 68 percent of
kidnapping victims were released after ransoms were paid, 26
percent were rescued and 6 percent were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Velazco was kept in a house in the mountains outside Bogota with
several other victims. Meeting with the wives of two kidnapped men
after her release, she gave them encouraging details, describing
their health, eating habits and long hair from months without
visiting a barber.
</P>
<P>
   The wives of the missing men listened intently to every detail,
often laughing and making jokes. But the warm scene was etched with
uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, the psychologist, worries that the crime has become so
common that Colombians now simply accept it as a normal part of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks it's just the rich who are the victims, but
it's not,'' she said. ``They come from every walk of life. The
worst part is there is no one to answer for this. It leads to a
lack of trust, to a perception that there are enemies everywhere.
The social fabric is torn apart. How can you have a society when
people can't trust each other?''
</P>
<P>
   Deisy Castillo's life has been changed since her uncle was
nabbed. Once optimistic, a freshly-minted law school graduate, now
she struggles to find hope. She has no job, nor does her husband,
also a lawyer. They get by doing legal work for friends and
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Since the kidnapping, the tough times have become edged with
fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let my children outside to play,'' she said. ``I'm
scared for them. We're scared to own anything because we fear
someone will come for us if they think we have things. If we could
leave Colombia we would. There's no future here for my children.''

MINIMALIST PIZZA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: 2nd take contains recipes.) 
 By   MARK BITTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like pasta, pizza is one of the easiest meals to make fast and
vary endlessly. If you skip the usual cooked tomato sauce on top,
pizza seems even simpler. Just start with raw ingredients,
especially the fresh herbs and vegetables of summer, augmented by a
little richness, like cheese or sausage.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more possible combinations of pizza toppings than
moves in chess or atoms in the universe, but I've found that using
the fewest components works best. Too many ingredients merely muddy
the flavors. Just zucchini, sausage and garlic, for example, will
deliver intense but clear tastes.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest pizzas begin with basic combinations: olive oil and
salt with rosemary and minced garlic, chopped onions or chopped
shallots; freshly grated Parmesan with sage; shallots with olive
oil and thyme; chopped basil with garlic and oil.
</P>
<P>
   Sliced tomatoes, mozzarella and basil also fall into the basic
category, but even that mix can be varied with great results. Green
tomatoes are good companions for Parmesan and basil.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh toppings should never be too wet or the dough will become
soggy. Fresh tomatoes should be seeded and drained; other moist
vegetables like zucchini should be thinly sliced and salted and
left to drain so they exude some liquid. Toppings that are too dry
are liable to fall off, though that's not an issue with these. It's
unlikely that you'll be eating pizza you make yourself while
walking down the street, and you can handle dry pizzas pretty
efficiently with a plate, knife and fork. Some people think all
pizzas have to have cheese to bind the other ingredients, but this
is ridiculously limiting.
</P>
<P>
   Corn kernels, freshly cut off the cob, make a crunchy topping
with shredded arugula and diced bacon; the bacon helps the other
ingredients adhere to the crust. Black olives add a twist to a
typical tomato topping.
</P>
<P>
   As for the dough, there are three ways to produce it (by
machine, by hand, by shopping) and three ways to cook it (on a
baking sheet or a pizza stone in the oven, or on the grill). In
every case, a very high temperature is essential for the best
crust. Professional pizza ovens cook at 700 degrees or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Using the food processor is quick and efficient, but you can
also make the dough by hand; it's not difficult. I use instant
yeast because it works much better than the regular kind. Or you
can buy dough, either in the supermarket (usually in the freezer;
use white bread dough if specially prepared pizza dough isn't
available) or from a local pizza shop (just ask; you'll usually be
accommodated).
</P>
<P>
   The dough can be mixed from an hour to two or three days before
you want to cook the pizzas. You can also keep dough for weeks in
the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Like nearly identical bread dough, pizza dough is best when it
is moist and a little sticky, so use flour judiciously. The dough
should be allowed to rest, especially before and during the final
shaping, although you can cut corners.
</P>
<P>
   If you are patient, and stretch the dough a little bit at a
time, you can produce a thin crust without tearing it. Small pizzas
are easier to handle than large ones, especially if you're
grilling. If necessary, grill or bake the pies sequentially, eating
one while the second is still cooking. Or serve them at room
temperature, as is commonly done in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   An oven lined with a baking stone (or several uncoated quarry
tiles) is ideal for baking pizza, but it requires a flat sheet of
wood or metal with a long handle, called a peel, to move the pizza
about. A baking sheet, with or without a lip, is easier to use,
because you can press the dough right onto it and get the thinnest
crust. Olive oil, on the pan and on your hands, will prevent
sticking.
</P>
<P>
   Grilling pizza is easier than you might think; the dough never
sticks to the grill, and it develops lovely grill marks, a crisp
crust and good flavor.
</P>
<P>
   To do it, start a medium-hot charcoal or wood fire, or preheat a
gas grill to the maximum. Roll or lightly press a ball of risen
pizza dough into a flat round, lightly flouring the work surface
and the dough only as necessary. Let the dough sit a few minutes,
and then roll or pat it out as thin as you like, turning
occasionally and sprinkling the top with flour as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Slide the crust directly onto the grill. Cook until brown grill
marks appear, about three to five minutes. Flip the dough over with
a spatula or tongs, lay on whatever topping you choose, cover the
grill and cook until the bottom is crisp and brown and the topping
is hot.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a pizza stone built into your oven, shape and top
the dough right on the peel, and then slide it into the oven. The
timing is about the same as for pizza cooked on a baking sheet, or
perhaps just a bit shorter.

   PIZZA DOUGH
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour or more
</P>
<P>
   3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, plus more as needed
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons instant yeast, such as SAF-Instant Yeast.
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons coarse sea or kosher salt, plus extra for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   1 to 1\ cups water
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   1. If using a food processor, combine flour, yeast and salt in
work bowl. Turn machine on and add 1 cup water and the oil through
the feed tube. Process 30 seconds, adding up to \ cup more water, a
little at a time, until mixture forms a ball and is slightly sticky
to the touch. (In unlikely event mixture is too sticky, add flour,
a tablespoon at a time.) To make dough by hand, combine half the
flour with the yeast and salt in a bowl and stir to blend. Add 1
cup water and the olive oil; stir with a wooden spoon until smooth.
Add remaining flour bit at a time; when mixture becomes too stiff
to stir with a spoon, begin kneading, adding as little remaining
flour as possible, just enough to keep dough from being sticky
mess. Knead 5 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Turn dough onto a floured work surface and knead by hand a
few seconds to form a smooth, round ball. Transfer to a bowl and
cover with plastic wrap; let rise until doubled in size, 1 to 2
hours. (You can cut rising time if you are in a hurry, or you can
let dough rise more slowly in refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours.) Dough
can then be used immediately or wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and
frozen for a month. Defrost in covered bowl in refrigerator or at
room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   3. Form risen dough into a ball and divide into two or more
pieces; roll each into a ball. Place each on a lightly floured
surface, sprinkle with a little flour, and cover with plastic wrap
or a towel. Let rest until slightly puffed, about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Oil one or more baking sheets, then press each dough ball
into a flat round directly on sheet. Pat out dough as thin as you
like, using oiled hands if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   5. Proceed with any recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: Enough dough for 1 large, 2 medium, or more smaller
pizzas.

 &HT;    Preparing for a new school year
 &HT;    By Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   School starts in about a month in many locations around the
country. Parents wishing to give their child a good start may want
to begin thinking about some of the more important elements of
education in their child's life.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Discussing education in a very positive and enthusiastic way
rather than reflecting on the end of the summer with dread creates
a positive mindset for the child. Remind the child that he or she
will be seeing friends not seen for several weeks, resuming
activities not available during the summer and embarking on new
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The first day of school can be a day of stress. If the child
is entering school for the first time, separation anxiety may
require extra time on the part of the parent to make the transition
smoother. Talk to the child in a relaxed manner about the
importance of the day, then send your child to school properly
dressed, well-rested and feeling well physically.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If your child has been retained and is reluctant to return to
school because he feels like a failure or because his friends from
the former year will be in a different class, discuss this matter
with him freely. Emphasize that he/she is not a failure, that
he/she may need extra time to build a solid foundation for future
educational experiences.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Build good communication skills with your child, his teacher
and other school personnel. Show an active interest in his work.
Keep family discussions about knowledge and school at a positive
level.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Set priorities for home study. Have a place available for the
child to concentrate and work. Encourage the child to set aside a
definite time for study each day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If your child is school resistant, you may need to talk with
school or health officials to determine if the root cause is more
than attitude and apathy. The child's doctor should be consulted
and a psychological or educational evaluation may be necessary to
determine if there are learning disabilities. Working with the
child on an individual basis often will correct the problem.
Special classes are also available within the school.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the likelihood of a successful school experience for
children increases with proper preparation and positive attitude on
the part of parents.

&HT;     LEWIS HAD SUPPORT OF TEAM DURING MURDER TRIAL ORDEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM ORSBORN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTMINSTER, Md. _ Ray Lewis is understandably reluctant to talk
about what it was like living as an accused murderer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, we're in the first day of training camp,'' the Ravens
linebacker said Monday. ``Let's just talk about football.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is one aspect of his ordeal that he will discuss.
With a smile and a look of peace, he will tell you that teammate
Shannon Sharpe held him together while he was being tried for
murder in connection with two stabbing deaths during a post-Super
Bowl brawl outside an Atlanta nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a blessing,'' Lewis said of having the former
Broncos star on hand during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, who lives in Atlanta during the off-season, came to
Lewis' aid shortly after learning of the charges against his friend
_ and before the Pro Bowl tight end signed with the Baltimore
Ravens on Feb. 22 as an unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shannon is a friend who's been around for a long time,''
Lewis, 24, said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to keep Lewis' mind off the trial, Sharpe convinced
the former Miami Hurricane that he should spend his free time in
Atlanta working out rather than worrying about his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I was leaving the courtroom, I was going to
(Sharpe's) house and working out,'' Lewis said. ``My mind was never
on (the trial). That's what kept me settled. We worked and worked
and worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' nightmare finally ended last month when prosecutors
dropped all murder charges against him in return for a guilty plea
to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   But the end of the trial did not mean the end of Sharpe's
involvement with Lewis. Sharpe, a 10-year NFL veteran with 662
career receptions, tried his best after the trial to convince Lewis
that he needed to make better choices and stay out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is young, but I've also told Ray, at some point, you can't
use age as an excuse,'' Sharpe, 32, said. ``I told him, at some
point, people are going to start to say, `Maybe the decisions that
he makes are a reflection of the person, instead of the age being a
reflection of the decisions he makes.'
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, you have to be accountable. (I told him),
`You've got your one strike. Learn from it, and let's move on.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, after running some post-practice wind sprints with
Sharpe, Lewis sounded like a man happy to have received a second
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful to wake up every morning,'' Lewis said. ``That's
what I feel joy about.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sharpe: ``He realizes he made a mistake, and he's going to
learn from it. I can imagine how happy he is. Spending the rest of
your life in prison is no joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe hasn't been the only Raven to openly support Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition for Ray to come back was very easy because of
the fact that he has so much support from the team,'' said running
back Priest Holmes. ``We welcomed him with open arms, and we were
waiting for him when he came back to practice in June. We rallied
around him and supported him and gave him as much attention as we
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Said cornerback Rod Woodson: ``We're just happy it's over for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his off-season troubles, Lewis is expected to have
another big season. The three-time Pro Bowl choice led the NFL in
tackles the past two seasons and has been Baltimore's leader in
stops the past four campaigns. Led by Lewis' 167 tackles, the
Ravens finished second in the league in total defense, surrendering
263.9 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus this season is to be No. 1 in defense, period,''
said Lewis, in the second year of a four-year, $26 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ravens coach Brian Billick: ``I think, quite frankly, that
we have the best defense in the league. I can't think of another
unit that I would trade for.''
</P>
<P>
   Billick and his players expect a banner season. The Ravens, who
finished last season in third place in the tough AFC Central with
an 8-8 record, strengthened themselves during the off-season by
acquiring Sharpe and tight end Ben Coates and drafting Tennessee
running back Jamal Lewis and Florida wide receiver Travis Taylor in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations here are high,'' Billick said. ``Anything
less than a playoff appearance will be considered a failure.''

 &HT;    DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Baseball park's demise like losing
a loved one
 &HT;    (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Don Gardner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Special to Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ Dad and I attended almost all the games at
Finch Field after World War II to see our beloved Hi-Toms play
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   I could hardly wait for him to come home and eat dinner so we
could pile into the truck and go to the game.
</P>
<P>
   I remember how I always ran up the steps of the grandstand ahead
of dad, anxious to see the players and drink in the scene with one
quick, exciting gulp.
</P>
<P>
   I remember the sounds of balls smacking gloves and the sharp
crack of a bat followed by the sudden roar from the fans as a
batter drove in a run.
</P>
<P>
   I remember the pleasant smell of grass, freshly mowed before the
game, and shelling roasted peanuts and putting them in my bottle of
Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   There was the one glorious year the scoreboard had a large
mechanical goose, and how everyone laughed and cheered as she
slowly waddled along, squawking dramatically over the p.a. system
as she laid an ``egg'' each inning the opposition failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same year our bat boy was named Egolly. Whenever he
went onto the field to deliver baseballs to the umpire, the fans
shouted, ``By golly, there's Egolly.''
</P>
<P>
   All of that happened a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many years later after a career in the Coast Guard, my wife and
I moved to High Point. After settling in, I revisited Finch Field.
</P>
<P>
   I knew a professional baseball team had not played there for
more than a decade, but I wasn't prepared for what I saw.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous small, dingy industrial shops occupied what once had
been the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Entire sections of rusty outfield fence had fallen, and tall
weeds covered the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   The light poles seemed to stand as patient beacons, waiting
forlornly to be illuminated again for a night game.
</P>
<P>
   Peeling paint exposed countless scabs and scars in the wooden
grandstand, which looked tired and worn, as if ready to give up the
ghost.
</P>
<P>
   I felt vaguely embarrassed to be here as the scene etched itself
forever into my heart.
</P>
<P>
   Finch Field had once been a special place for me, but now I felt
I was standing at the grave of a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   Reliving long-ago memories, to see the changes and disfigurement
that time has wrought, is often bitingly painful.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been a wonderful miracle to be 17 years old once
more, at least for a day, and to see another baseball game at Finch
Field.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know whether the tears were for Finch Field or for me as
I drove quickly away.

TEXAS PARK LOSES APPEAL FOR CLIMBERS AS STATE PROTECTS ANCIENT
DRAWINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though Hueco Tanks State Historical Park was considered a
rock-climbing mecca, once attracting enthusiasts from as far as
Europe, only a few now scale its cliffs and boulders.
</P>
<P>
   And, avid climber Jeffrey Drucker is moving away.
</P>
<P>
   Drucker, a physics professor at nearby University of Texas at El
Paso, says the state's clampdown on access at the far West Texas
park _ to protect ancient cave drawings _ was a factor in his
departure for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as rock climbers are concerned, Hueco Tanks has ceased
to be a rock climbing destination,'' Drucker said. ``We have tried
every avenue known to us and have failed utterly. I suspect it's
all over but the crying. They just don't trust people in that park.
They've made the choice of preservation at any cost over
recreation.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, Texas Parks and Wildlife restricted visitors
at the 860-acre park, 32 miles east of El Paso, to protect the rock
art and sacred American Indian sites on its grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Historical preservationists had wanted tighter restrictions to
preserve pictographs, some of which have been defaced by graffiti.
Arrowheads and spear heads in the park date back 10 millienia,
according to The Handbook of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The artwork's spiritual value was so unique to Native Americans
that the Texas Historical Commission's first archaeologist, Curtis
Tunnell, compared Hueco Tanks to the Sistine Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Parks and Wildlife revised the park's rules this month,
allowing a few more visitors and the return of overnight camping,
which was expected to begin this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But the restrictions against climbers, including being monitored
by guides, have not been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go there if you follow the rules, but you are still
extremely limited,'' said Mike Lewis, a 40-year-old San Antonio
climber. ``You have to get a reservation, which isn't easy. Then
you have to find a guide who may not be able to go when you can.
And then a majority of the areas you want to climb are restricted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it frustrating is there is no evidence that the
climbers caused any damage or vandalism to the rock art,'' Lewis
added.
</P>
<P>
   John Moses, Hueco Tanks park manager, said the rules aren't
meant to single out climbers but simply to protect the rock art
that dates back centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take off on your own and go climbing,'' Moses said.
``I think that's a little too civilized for some people. We have
some of the same problems with Native American groups who don't
want certified guides or rangers going along with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Access Fund, a Boulder, Colo.-based climbing advocacy group,
proposed last month to donate $100,000 to Hueco Tanks as part of a
cooperative agreement. But ``we were flatly rejected,'' said Sally
Moser, the group's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The money would have been used not only to build trails and
protect rock art but also to help re-open some sites on a test
basis to climbers, Moser said. In a June 30 letter, Walter Dabney,
director of the state parks division, said he could not support the
agreement ``that would allow climbing in areas outside of North
Mountain without the presence of a tour guide.''
</P>
<P>
   The park has a staff of seven and a list of 30 guides. The 1998
restrictions allowed up to 210 visitors at any one time. That limit
has been raised to 230.
</P>
<P>
   Moses, the park ranger, said that the rules are applied equally
and that he cannot exempt climbers.
</P>
<P>
   For many rock climbers, Hueco Tanks is not worth the trouble
despite the world-class terrain, Lewis said. Most Central Texas
climbers now prefer mountain sites near Monterrey, Mexico, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have to put up with the hassles of Mexico and crossing
the border but that's still easier than the restrictions at Hueco
Tanks,'' Lewis added.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Todsen, a Las Cruces, N.M., archaeologist and park volunteer
who studied the Hueco Tanks rock art for years, said the
restrictions are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the climbers' complaints, for the most part, don't
really have a lot of validity,'' said Todsen, 57. ``It is really an
archaeological park. I think a lot of the climbers are very
conscientious but there is a fringe element that would just as soon
eliminate the rock art so they could go climbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Todsen said rock art that had been obscured by charcoal residue
is reappearing in one place in the park.

HEARING TODAY COULD MEAN NAPSTER SHUTDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in San Francisco is set to hear
arguments Wednesday in the recording industry's request for a
preliminary injunction against Napster, the controversial
music-swapping service. The closely watched case is expected to
have dramatic implications for the future of how consumers buy and
listen to music. The judge could rule that Napster is guilty of
copyright infringement and opt to shut the service down
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing comes as Napster is scrambling to establish itself
as a legitimate music-sampling business that respects artists'
rights and spurs CD sales. At a digital music conference in New
York, Napster CEO Hank Barry said that the company is working to
figure out a way to compensate artists when their works are traded
on Napster. ``The question is, `Where would we send the check?' ''
he said Monday at the Jupiter Communications Plug-In conference.
</P>
<P>
   Barry's remarks came after Time Warner president Richard D.
Parsons lambasted Napster, invoking the language of the Cold War
and likening the service to hijackers, pirates, and the devil.
Paraphrasing the words of President John F. Kennedy, Parsons vowed
that Time Warner and the recording industry would ``pay any price
and bear any burden . . . to protect the copyrights of their
artists.'' At the same time, he admitted that the major record
labels have been ``asleep at the switch'' and needed to act quickly
to offer digital music distribution over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Barry said that he is still trying to settle with the record
labels, but added that the company will comply if the judge pulls
the plug. The case is being heard by US District Court Judge
Marilyn Patel, the same judge who ruled earlier this year that
another Internet company, MP3.com, was guilty of copyright
infringement in a separate case.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources expect that Napster will ultimately lose the
case but that the record labels will likely develop their own
music-sharing services. ``Napster is the sacrificial lamb, and
probably rightly so,'' said Marc Geiger, CEO of Artist Direct, an
Internet music company. ``But file sharing is here to stay.''

GILES NAMED CURATOR OF NIEMAN FOUNDATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Nieman Foundation curator Robert Giles says he intends to
build on his predecessor Bill Kovach's ``wonderful efforts to
elevate the standards of journalism'' as he takes the reins at the
nation's most prestigious journalism fellowship program.
</P>
<P>
   Giles, 67, a senior vice president at the Freedom Forum, was
named curator Tuesday. The announcement by Harvard University
followed a bruising process that included a lobbying campaign by
unions angered by what they described as Giles's divisive role in
the Detroit newspaper strike when he was editor and publisher of
The Detroit News. Giles supporters, including a number of prominent
newspaper editors, countered with a lobbying campaign on his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it, I think, fairly philosophically,'' said Giles of
the controversy over his candidacy. ``One of the values of
journalism that is very important to me is freedom of expression. I
think Harvard gave (my critics') concerns a lot of careful
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Harvard president Neil Rudenstine said that
``with all the forces acting today on the field of journalism, a
program such as the Nieman has more to contribute than ever. I am
confident that Bob Giles is the right person to lead it at this
stage of its work.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the house where I grew up in Brooklyn, food was a
religion. Christmas dinner would last four hours. You'd have the
appetizer, talk about it, have another course, talk some more. You
were aware of not just what went into the meal, but what the
textures were supposed to be like, why one dish was better than
another.
</P>
<P>
   I graduated with a degree in chemistry, then took a job at
General Foods, now Kraft Foods, in the sensory-product evaluation
group. I worked on Jell-O, Minute Rice, Cool Whip. Finally I was
trained to be a coffee taster. Just to be asked to do that is a big
deal. Wine and fine fragrances are the most difficult things to
evaluate; then come coffee and chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I ever tasted at General Foods, the group leader
said: ``Here are three samples of Jell-O. We think there might be a
problem with one.'' They all tasted like red Jell-O to me. I looked
up, and everyone was writing furiously. I thought: this must be a
hazing. They finished and started to talk about ethyl maltol. I
thought, ``Ethel who?'' Ethyl maltol is the chemical flavor in
strawberry cotton candy. It's very sweet. Every other person in the
group said the second sample tasted like wet wool, wet sweater, wet
dog, wet fur. The reason was that the second sample was made with
gelatin that wasn't clean; it had an animal-fur note. I was so
depressed. I couldn't detect defective gelatin, and I thought my
career was over. I tell people this story when they're starting out
in the field, just to say: ``Hang in there. You'll get it.''
</P>
<P>
   When you evaluate food, you pay attention to what you feel on
the tongue _ bitterness, sourness, sweetness, saltiness. There are
also chemical feelings _ cooling, metallic, astringent, nasal
pungency (like horseradish). Smell is the hardest. When I train
people, I have them smell vials of chemicals or flavors _ orange,
mint, cinnamon, oregano, clove, strawberry. If I'm tasting coffee,
for instance, in the nose I might perceive fruity or winy, the
roasted character, whether it's nutty or woody _ those are the
positive notes. Negative notes would be cereal (caused by the
inferior robusta bean), rubbery, burnt.
</P>
<P>
   I've been doing this for 35 years, and I never get bored. It's a
sensory jolt every day. Tasting or smelling is like anthropology or
archaeology. You're watching to see what unfolds in a product,
discovering new things. But there is a limit to how much tasting
you can do. I could probably taste 10 coffees in an hour, but only
3 salsas and one toothpaste. In a week I probably do about 10 to 15
hours of evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 300 professional tasters in the United States,
and we consider it unprofessional not to evaluate something just
because you don't like it. I hate cinnamon _ as a child, I got sick
on cinnamon candy _ but I can taste it. I don't like sea slugs;
they're chewy and slimy. But every time I go to Japan, I try them.
</P>
<P>
   Because I'm so critical about food, people don't want to invite
me home for dinner. I just tell them to roast a chicken and steam
some vegetables, and I'll be happy.

 &HT;    AIR DELAYS RISE 58 PERCENT IN FIVE YEARS, FEDERAL REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One in every five airplane flights in the United
States is delayed, according to a federal report issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by the Department of Transportation's
inspector general,
</P>
<P>
   also said that since 1995 there has been an increase in both the
number of flight delays and cancellations and in the average length
of a delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we don't have a uniform measure to track delays, the
Federal Aviation Administration reported an 58 percent increase in
delays from 1995 to 1999 _ and even more troubling _ flight
cancellations increased 68 percent over the same time,'' said
Inspector General Kenneth M. Mead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most delays are occurring on the ground, and the number of
flights experiencing a taxi-out time of at least one hour increased
a staggering 130 percent,'' Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport was cited for having
the fourth worst increase in flight cancellations between 1995 and
1999, at 138 percent. The total cost to the airlines of flight
delays at Hartsfield in 1999 was estimated at $250.9 million, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of flights at Hartsfield in which planes spent more
than one hour taxiing on the runway rose to 2,445 in 1999, an 111
percent increase from 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's O'Hare airport had more than twice as many flights
that taxied for more than an hour as Hartsfield. The number of
flights that taxied for more than four hours at O'Hare was 57,
compared to two at Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials also noted that flight operations at Atlanta were
less affected by poor weather than the two other airports with the
most flights analyzed in the study, Dallas-Ft. Worth and O'Hare.
</P>
<P>
   The precise number of flight delays nationwide is undetermined
because the two major agencies collecting data _ the FAA and the
Bureau of Transportation Statistics _ use different methods, Mead
told the transportation subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two agencies is more than 1.7 million
delayed flights, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA's statistics do not report flight delays that are
caused by the airlines, it only reports delays that occur after the
plane comes into the FAA's control,'' Mead said. ``In addition,
according to the BTS, a flight is considered on time if it departed
or arrived within 15 minutes of schedule, meaning the plane could
taxi on the runway for four hours and still not be considered
delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kragh(CQ), an air traffic controller from Newark's
airport, said that the airlines ``pad'' their schedules with extra
time for flights so as not to adversely affect their on-time
percentages.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, a flight from Washington, D.C., to Atlanta takes
a little over an hour in actual flight time, but the airlines
schedule the flight to last two hours because they know the runways
will be overbooked on departure and/or arrival,'' Kragh testified.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the subcommittee, said
the airlines and the FAA need to cooperate to find an answer as to
what is causing the increased delays and cancellations of flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines blame the FAA and the air traffic controllers for
mismanaging the national airspace system, while the FAA blames bad
weather, aircraft equipment problems, and outdated technology, and
the air traffic controllers point the finger at the airlines for
scheduling so many flights at the same time during peak hours,''
Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there is probably validity to all of these points of
views, passengers know the simple truth that air travel is costly,
unpleasant, and less reliable than they would like,'' he said.

WHEN I COULDN'T SAY WHAT I WANTED TO SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL RECORD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this month I watched Texas Rangers manager Johnny Oates
give umpire Tony Randazzo a tongue-lashing because of the way he
was calling balls and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Oates appeared to have lost it. He jerked his head back and
forth as fast as the words coming out of his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Star-Telegram sportswriter T.R. Sullivan quoted Oates
in the next day's paper as saying that he had gone too far in
berating Randazzo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't have done that,'' the manager was quoted as
saying. ``Tony didn't deserve that.''
</P>
<P>
   As I watched Randazzo stand tall and silent before finally
ejecting Oates, I thought to myself:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he knows exactly how a newspaper ombudsman feels
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of readers I dealt with during my years as
ombudsman of this newspaper were courteous. But there was that
small number who really put me to the test.
</P>
<P>
   They were the racists, the homophobes, those who just seemed to
enjoy hating another person or group, and those who simply did not
know what they were talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, they were few.
</P>
<P>
   Often I could quickly spot them. Frequently, they would begin a
phone conversation by saying, ``I'm not a racist, but ...'' or ``I
don't hate gays, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Many spewed forth their venom while declining to identify
themselves on the phone or in writing.
</P>
<P>
   But few that they were, they still drove me to the brink of
striking back in their terms. Those who love to hate drove me over
the brink on at least two occasions. Both times I found it
necessary to call the reader back to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   We ombudsmen do not have the right to eject a reader as Randazzo
ejected Oates.
</P>
<P>
   But I did have one ground rule _ one shared by many other
ombudsmen _ concerning the rantings of the haters. When their words
became personally abusive, I would caution them that I was not
expected to take that kind of treatment. If the abuse continued, I
would hang up.
</P>
<P>
   Few were the times I was forced to do this, but there were many
times I had to restrain myself from striking back in kind in spoken
or written words.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders LaMont, the ombudsman of The Sacramento Bee, knows what
I mean.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent column he noted that those in the newspaper business
_ and other fields _ have ``developed techniques to deal politely
with the thousands of phone calls and letters they receive. Good
listening and conflict resolution skills, along with basic
politeness, are taught in every office.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned his attention to those he termed the
``hard-to-deal-with people.''
</P>
<P>
   LaMont presented a number of ``non-original responses'' that
many ombudsmen undoubtedly would love to resort to when confronted
by an abusive or uninformed reader. He said most of these have been
floating around for years, and one probably dates back to famed
journalist H.L. Mencken in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Here are LaMont's wish-we-could-use responses (and I'm sure
there are times that many of you wish you could use them):
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Sir. You are correct. The reason we made that mistake is
that we knew it would drive you crazy, and we wanted to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Sir. Thank you for calling it to our attention that the
2,000 employees of this company are all incompetent and motivated
by a desire to do a bad job, waste your time and personally make
your life miserable. We appreciate your business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Sir. Thank you for having the courage of your conviction
to call and let us know, anonymously, that you have a strong
command of profane language.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Madame. Thank you for the helpful critique of our
product, and the promise that you will never buy from us again no
matter what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Sir. Thank you for calling it to our attention that
everyone at this place of business is driven by a burning desire to
bring down democracy as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is LaMont's favorite for someone who supplies a name:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Sir. I think you should be aware that some idiot is
writing letters and signing your name. You might want to
investigate to avoid legal action.''
</P>
<P>
   I would on occasion hear from a reader who was so angry _
frequently righteously _ that he or she was almost incoherent.
</P>
<P>
   I had a pretty effective response to screamers. ``Be quiet!'' I
would shoot back. ``You are so mad I'm afraid you are going to have
a heart attack, and we simply are not worth that.''
</P>
<P>
   This frequently would calm the reader down to the point where we
could have a rational discussion of the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, whose anger had turned to laughter, actually replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn, you're good.''
</P>
<P>

A CHILL IN THE AIR FOR FREE-RANGE CHICKENS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROZANNE GOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imported free-range chickens processed by a new method are
winning converts among New York chefs and could be in supermarkets
by September.
</P>
<P>
   Gionnone Poultry, in St. Cuthbert, northeast of Montreal, has
devised a technique for chilling its freshly slaughtered chickens
with frigid air instead of water, said Tony Gionnone, the sales
director. As a result, he said, the birds are less likely to breed
bacteria and also absorb no liquid; the taste and texture both
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Gionnone chickens are ``the closest in flavor and juiciness to
the famous poulet de Bresse of France,'' said David Cunningham, the
chef at the Lenox Room, on the Upper East Side. Cunningham, who has
cooked in France, was among the first to showcase the Canadian
chickens on his menu.
</P>
<P>
   The birds are big and meaty, with great chicken taste. They are
raised on corn, soy and wheat and receive no antibiotics or growth
hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials studied chicken processing in Europe before
developing the new method, which uses air to evenly chill
eviscerated chickens as they travel through a cooling room for
exactly 64 minutes, reaching a temperature of 34 degrees. The
technique was designed to meet the strict sanitary rules of the
Canadian and United States agriculture departments. It eliminates
the usual final step of spraying the birds with water to keep them
from drying out.
</P>
<P>
   The chickens are immediately packaged using a new process that
gives them a 10-to-14-day shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   Gionnone chickens are served at Bouterin, the Brasserie, Monkey
Bar, Clementine, Tabla, Della Femina and the Water Club as well as
the Ryland Inn in Whitehouse, N.J. At retail, whole Gionnone
chickens are $1.95 a pound from D'Artagnan, (800) 327-8246.

IN A QUIET WOOD, A PATHOLOGIST UNDER SIEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAN HOFFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELMAR, N.Y. _ Here, in the dappled woods of upstate New York on
a kiss-perfect summer day, Ward B. Stone is downstairs in the
laboratory, showing off his freezer collection.
</P>
<P>
   The walk-in model. Then the chest unit, stocked with neatly
labeled jars _ bits of brains, livers, spleens mostly. Next, a
stainless steel beauty with shelves, on wheels. ``This is the
mobile mort,'' explains Stone, 61, whose flannel shirt-sleeves are
rolled up, jeans faded, eyebrows tufted, white hair long, unruly.
``It's for dead people, but we use it for turtles.''
</P>
<P>
   In this, Stone's 32nd year as chief and only wildlife
pathologist for New York State, his freezers are crammed with
animals whose deaths will have to wait to be investigated _ victims
of illegal hunts, poisonings and pesticide ingestions among them.
It's triage time.
</P>
<P>
   This summer Stone, who works a seven-day week in normal years,
has a corpse crisis: everybody's nervous, so everybody's shipping
him their dead crows, sparrows and blue jays, about 300 a day, to
be checked for West Nile virus. He estimates finding about 50 cases
so far.
</P>
<P>
   He looks over the latest delivery. ``What's this chicken doing
here?'' grumbles Stone. ``We're not doing some veterinarian's work
for free! Next thing, everybody will be sending us their pet
parakeets.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``we'' means Stone, two assistants, a secretary and a couple
of summer interns. Now consider that in addition to the West Nile
candidates _ which, depending on a host of factors, his team may
slice, dice, type and pickle, sending tissue to a nearby lab for
testing _ the daily haul for necropsies can include bear, moose,
beaver, swans, hawks, bats and deer, deer, deer.
</P>
<P>
   Also consider that he is always running a study on pesticides;
writing scientific articles (in today's mail, acceptance letters
for two); inveighing against human-made threats to wildlife;
lumbering off to inoculate infested ducks, which cause swimmer's
itch in local lakes; testifying in court; nursing wounded animals;
and swabbing down his crematory. Stone, whose last raise lifted his
salary to $59,908, may be a touch overwhelmed. But now, for a
change, no one is trying to fire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all getting along,'' remarks Stone, with a dramatic eye
roll. ``At the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a file of dire letters from the many superiors he's
outlasted. (And they have plenty from him.) A darling of
environmentalists, who praise his pioneering work in detecting
pollutants like polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, in wildlife,
and who rally when his job is in jeopardy, Stone turns out to be a
loud, throbbing administrative pain.
</P>
<P>
   He has leaked data to reporters, sampled landfills and
incinerator ash _ far afield from pathology, sniff specialists who
call him untrained, a meddler _ attacked popular fishing practices
like lead sinkers and embarrassed bosses at the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation by finding traces of DDT
on the grounds of a regional office.
</P>
<P>
   But Stone, whose ancestors landed at Plymouth Colony, has a
sturdy sense of self-importance, a taskmaster's bite, a truculent
shoulder shrug and a lifelong sense of wonder about wild critters.
In wildlife pathology, Stone, who has a master's degree in zoology,
is influential, regarded as innovative but precise. So he
apologizes not.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary. ``There's always so much going on that I have a
nagging feeling I'm not doing enough,'' says Stone, leaning back in
his office chair and using his belly as an arm rest.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with a nagging feeling about those dying crows, Stone
was one of the early investigators to send samples around the
country persistently, until the deadly, mosquito-borne virus was
identified.
</P>
<P>
   About the recent public response, he has mixed emotions. The
spraying may threaten monarch butterflies and some fish, he says.
Yet West Nile threatens not only humans, he notes, but large
mammals and birds like the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon,
which have scant populations.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, who grew up in rural Columbia County, tries to live
within the means dictated by his convictions and his bank account.
He has been driving the same gas-efficient car since 1992. His lawn
is green, free of pesticides, lush with weeds. With his partner,
Mary Bayham, an ecologist, he has four children under 7 (and an
adult daughter from a past marriage); he and the kids built their
swing set from road scraps. He teaches them to whittle toys,
garden, fish and stroll through streams.
</P>
<P>
   Nature, as Stone knows too well, can also be savage. Last month
he and Bayham buried their fifth child, a newborn. His grief is raw
and tear-drenched. ``I was the scientist but I had the most faith
that something could be done,'' he whispers.
</P>
<P>
   So he steeps himself in the work _ today's birds from New York
City have just arrived _ walks in the woods and attends to the
life-affirming demands of his brood.
</P>

ENERGY _ EVERYBODY WANTS MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK Z. SMITH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you hear the term ``Big Oil,'' it conjures up images of
global behemoths such as Exxon-Mobil and Royal Dutch/Shell. It's
hard to imagine anybody kicking these multinational giants around.
</P>
<P>
   But American politicians and motorists regularly do. Whenever
gasoline prices shoot upward, as they have this year, Big Oil takes
it on the chin.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, it's a bum rap. If Big Oil could
manipulate gas prices at will, as its critics infer, you wouldn't
see the precipitous price declines such as occurred in early 1999,
when the average U.S. pump price cratered to 99 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Energy prices are dictated primarily by powerful market forces
of supply and demand. They also can be affected by government
policies such as raising fuel taxes and by supply disruptions such
as pipeline breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest sustained upward pressure on energy prices comes
from two factors largely ignored by politicians, consumers and the
news media: enormous worldwide population growth and growing energy
demand in developing countries where people are steadily buying
more cars, appliances and other energy-eating goods.
</P>
<P>
   After the oil price shocks of the late 1970s and early 1980s,
the world became more fuel-stingy. Cars, home heating and cooling
systems, and industrial operations became far more energy-efficient
in the wake of $35-a-barrel crude.
</P>
<P>
   But those efficiency gains have been more than offset by huge
population increases and rising worldwide energy consumption. Even
though global oil output has risen, demand has grown every bit as
fast.
</P>
<P>
   The world population hit 6 billion last fall, virtually double
the number when John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 12 years, another billion people have been added to
the planet. That increase is nearly four times the 275 million
people in the United States, the third most populous country in the
world (behind China, with 1.2 billion people, and India, with 1
billion).
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Energy Information Administration has projected that
world energy consumption will jump by a staggering 60 percent from
1997 to 2020. Population gains and greatly heightened purchases of
energy-consuming goods in developing countries will be overwhelming
factors in this growth.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. energy consumption is projected to rise 28 percent in
that period, the EIA forecasts that China will experience an
immense 265 percent increase and India a 231 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
   China is expected to be gobbling 9.5 million barrels of oil
every 24 hours in 2020 _ more than four times the 2.3 million
barrels it used daily in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, only 10 Chinese in 1,000 owned cars; by 2020, 54 in
1,000 will _ a fivefold increase, the EIA forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The EIA expects that the fossil fuels of oil, natural gas and
coal will still be the world's prime energy sources in 2020.
</P>
<P>
   The $64 question is how much impact a continued sharp rise in
global population and energy consumption will have not only on oil
and gasoline prices but in contributing to pollution and global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Tinker, director of the Bureau of Economic Geology at the
University of Texas in Austin, says of the prospects for
mushrooming energy use in large developing countries, ``It's a
scary thought when a billion people in India and well over a
billion people in China go through an industrial revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Given all these ominous numbers, it's obvious that we must
accelerate the agenda for developing more fuel-efficient vehicles,
better mass transit systems, promising energy technologies such as
fuel cells, and improved means of curbing air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   We also should think much harder about whether we want to keep
adding another billion people to the globe every dozen years or so.

ALL HAIL THE TAXI BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Andrew Murstein is president of Medallion Financial Corp., a
lender to small businesses; this was written with David
Leonhardt.)  
 By ANDREW MURSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My father and I are probably two of the only people in the
United States not to have made money in real estate in the last 20
years. In 1987, when I was getting my M.B.A., we bought 100 acres
of land in Old Westbury, N.Y. We wanted to develop luxury homes,
but the project ended up being a 12-year ordeal. It took us five
years to subdivide the land, and we didn't sell off the final lot
until last month. We barely broke even. That taught me that I
didn't know as much as I thought I did. It also reminded me of the
motto that my father has passed down to me, ``In niches, there are
riches.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, I concentrate on the businesses that I really
understand: taxis.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather got to this country from Europe, via Argentina,
in 1923. He had $150 in his pocket, and soon after he got here, New
York City issued 11,787 taxi medallions _ the same number as there
were until just a few years ago. Back then, they cost $10 apiece.
My grandfather bought one, and he started driving a cab. In his
mind, it was one of the few jobs in which success depended only on
how hard you worked.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he had saved up enough to buy his second medallion, and by
the 1960s, he had 150. They were terrific investments _ better than
stocks. We recently figured out that since the 1930s, the Dow Jones
industrial average has gone up 11 percent a year on average, and
taxi medallions 17 percent. Today, they sell for $250,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, my father started selling off some of the
medallions to diversify. But no bank would lend money to the buyers
_ immigrants from the Soviet Union, Haiti and India _ because they
didn't have any bank statements. So he started a loan business.
We've lent over $1 billion and never had to possess a single loan
even though the interest rates are higher than on bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   I've tried to identify other niche businesses where immigrants
are active and banks are not: dry cleaners, laundromats, grocery
stores and corporate car services. We also install the ads on the
tops of cabs. We give the taxi company $50 each month, and we get
$350 from the advertisers _ a much better return than my real
estate deal. There's no question about where our focus is: our
Nasdaq symbol is TAXI.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Sotheby's auctioned off the last Checker cab
to come off the streets of New York. It had a million miles on it.
A taxi owner heard I wanted to bid on it and called me to offer
another Checker for $25,000. I said no because the Sotheby's cab
was supposed to go for about the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   So I went to the auction and opened the bidding at $20,000.
Nobody else was raising their paddle, and I thought I was going to
get it. But then a guy called in and offered $30,000. So I said 40,
and he said 50. It just kept going. It was well past the point
where I wanted to end up; but all these people were watching, so I
kept going. He said 100, I said 110, he said 130, and I stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Then the guy who had wanted to sell me the other Checker came
up, and I said, ``I'll take your cab now!'' He said: ``Oh, no. Now
it will cost you $50,000.'' So I drove with this stranger to Queens
to check it out. When we got there, right near his Checker was
another car under a sheet. It turned to be yet another Checker. It
belonged to his uncle, who lived in Florida. So I asked him to call
his uncle, and his uncle took $2,000 for it. I still ask myself why
he let me buy that one when I was ready to pay $50,000 for his. But
soon it will be on the streets of Manhattan. Anybody can have a
limo as a company car. We'll have a Checker.

PAY FOR SLAVE LABOR ON U.S. CAPITOL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seldom have stranger political bedfellows than Rep. John Lewis,
D-Ga., and Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., found common cause on a
controversial issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two men share the common bond of African-American
derivation, they have been for the most part as far apart
ideologically as opposite sides of the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   It, of course, is not surprising that a liberal like Lewis would
support legislation calling for a thoroughgoing inquiry into the
use of slave labor in the construction of the U.S. Capitol. But it
is a hair short of amazing for an avowed black conservative like
Watts to be calling for the creation of a task force to explore the
facts of that glaring historical irony.
</P>
<P>
   What is even more astonishing is that Watts has indicated that
he might go so far as to endorse paying reparations to the
descendants of the slaves who worked on the Capitol, if the
genealogical connections can be proven.
</P>
<P>
   Records in the Architect of the Capitol's office reportedly
indicate that at least 400 slaves were used in the building's
construction from 1792 to 1800. Further exploration of the records,
says a recent story in USA Today, is expected to reveal that many
more worked on the project after 1800.
</P>
<P>
   That news story credits Edward Hotaling _ a Washington TV
producer who has written a book on black jockeys of the late 1800s
and early 1900s _ with the discovery of those records.
</P>
<P>
   However, TransAfrica President Randal Robinson dwelt on that
subject at length in his book ``The Debt,'' which went on sale
several months ago. Perhaps it was a case of inquiring minds
focusing on the same subject independently.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson wrote of speaking by telephone to William Allen,
Architect of the Capitol, and finding out that:
</P>
<P>
   _The U.S. government sent out an initial request for 100 slaves
for the first phase of the project in 1793 to 1802. The
slaveholders were to receive $5 per month for each slave used. The
slaves mined, loaded and transported sandstone blocks; fired and
stacked bricks; mixed the mortar; and sawed the long timbers.
</P>
<P>
   _A slave named Philip Reed cast the Statue of Freedom in bronze
and, along with other slaves, loaded its five 1-ton sections onto
reinforced wagons for the trip to the Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   They spent 39 days assembling the statue. Then they took it
apart again, hoisted it to the dome and reassembled it.
</P>
<P>
   _The Capitol was built in three phases. The second phase began
after the War of 1812. The third was under way during the Civil
War. During that war, many of the slaves who gravitated to the
Union lines were taken to Washington to work on the building. They
were classified as ``contraband slaves'' or ``spoils of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Those revelations might be dismissed as inconsequential
historical curiosities at another time. But because of the news
last week of the agreement reached between the United States and
Germany on compensation for thousands of people used as slave
laborers and forced laborers by the Third Reich, they assume a
heightened significance.
</P>
<P>
   The German government has agreed to establish a $5 billion fund
for the estimated 240,000 surviving Jewish slave laborers and the
nearly 1 million surviving non-Jewish forced laborers. The United
States will contribute $10 million to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of reparations to African-Americans for the
enslavement of their ancestors can seize upon the German
government's agreement as ammunition for their cause. Robinson's
new book is an eloquent call for such reparation. Payment of the
debt, Robinson believes, is an essential condition of racial
reconciliation in America.
</P>
<P>
   Given the enormity of the crime of 350 years of slavery,
segregation and discrimination, the size of America's debt to
African-Americans is too enormous for anyone to give any realistic
thought to paying it outright. What most realistic advocates of
reparations want is a continuation and expansion of policies and
programs aimed at helping African-Americans overcome the
disadvantages that the legacy of slavery has bequeathed to them.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, that debt must be acknowledged. The cause that
has brought John Lewis and J.C. Watts together could be an
important move in that direction.

SHOPPING THE MADISON AVENUE   OF MANHASSET (DON'T SAY MALL) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUY TREBAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHASSET, N.Y. _ The two blond women with the tousled Frederic
Fekkai haircuts were looking at snapshots over customized Cobbs
(hold the ham, hold the cucumber, hold the avocado) at Millie's
Place, the salads chased by iced tea, two Equals apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does she look good or does she look good?'' asked the first
woman, a 48-year-old grandmother, who asked to remain nameless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adorable,'' said her 50-year-old, anonymity-seeking friend.
``So, how was Aspen?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aspen was January. We're just back from Napa. So, are you
loving this picture?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful. And what is she wearing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How old is she now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months.''
</P>
<P>
   This exchange took place at the Americana shopping center in
Manhasset, N.Y., on Long Island's North Shore. Please don't say
mall, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Americana at Manhasset is to ``mall'' as upper Madison
Avenue is to Market Street in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Comparisons don't
obtain.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there are few places in America where a handsome
middle-aged woman dressed for a morning of tennis followed by light
lunch and some shopping would not appear conspicuous wearing a
crocodile Hermes belt ($1,495) over Ralph Lauren microfiber shorts
($95), a Jil Sander T-shirt ($300), a cotton sweater from Lacoste
($155), tan crocodile driving shoes from Tod's ($1,500) and
carrying a beige alligator Kelly bag ($7,000). Even the woman's
gold Rolex Oyster Perpetual Datejust ($15,900) was worn with the
insouciance most folks might associate with a Timex.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americana is not a most-folks destination. It is, as its
developer, Frank Castagna, said, the ``premiere shopping
destination on Long Island.'' With its limestone facade, designed
by the society architect Peter Marino, its swathes of meadow
flowers and grasses, arranged by the modish landscape architects
Oehme, van Sweden &AMP; Associates, its 225,000 square feet of retail
space devoted almost exclusively to luxury brands, the Americana
has become an alternate Madison Avenue, a mini Rodeo Drive, the
parking lot where America's economic steamroller gets its ticket
stamped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an off-the-radar oasis,'' said Deirdre Major, a
spokeswoman for the Castagna Realty Co., although the Americana
hasn't quite slipped the attention of Prada, Escada, Burberry,
Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and Max Mara, which all maintain stores
there, or of Louis Vuitton, whose Americana outpost averages annual
sales ``in the millions of dollars,'' a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Americana's tenants include not merely such traditional
carriage trade retailers as Tiffany &AMP; Co. and Christofle, but also
the members of the luxury pack currently dominating fashion
retailing in the United States. Giorgio Armani opened a new
franchise there just three weeks ago. Fendi and Hermes are both set
to inaugurate new boutiques in the fall. Hirshleifer's, the
venerable retailer specializing in high-end apparel from Gucci,
Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel, is undergoing renovation to triple
its selling space. And the accessories designer Kate Spade is also
in the process of opening a stand-alone shop. It probably says
something about a bull market that her location was formerly
occupied by a bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Americana, said John Slavinsky, a senior vice president for
Vuitton, ``is absolutely the best place to have a freestanding
store on Long Island, bar none.'' It doesn't require a business
degree from Wharton to understand the rationale for this, when even
babies are wearing Dior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' said Christina Makowsky, the owner of a Northern
Boulevard boutique, Georgina, that is what you might call
Americana-adjacent. ``You can't believe the money people are
throwing around these days. It's liquid millions. Even if you're
rich, you're poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 250 richest American towns recently cited by Worth
magazine, 12 in the top 50 are a short drive from the Americana.
The average household income of an Americana customer hovers around
$125,000, Major said. But surely, as one shop owner remarked, that
is too modest: ``Maybe it's the salary for the maid.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Nassau County wrangles with the state for a financial
bailout, the Americana delivers Prada platform shoes and Gucci lug
soles and Vuitton pastel logo bags to what Kiki Nolan, the manager
for Pink at the Americana, called, ``the richest people on Long
Island,'' the ones that ``you see at all the charity parties, the
grand parties, the famous rich families of Long Island.'' Plenty of
the Americana's customers seem to bypass fame, however, and head
straight to rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communities have changed,'' said Steven B. Greenberg, of the
Greenberg Group, retail consultants whose clients include Gucci.
``Long Island's old guard has sold many of those old homes. The
land has been subdivided. Instead of one $10 million home, you have
a lot of $3 million homes owned by people in their 30s and 40s.''
</P>
<P>
   These people don't want to venture to Manhattan, he went on.
``They want to buy luxury, but in a convenient setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Rents approach $200 a square foot, a price unsurpassed in any
suburban setting in America, Greenberg said. ``That's right up
there with the top shopping streets in America, but the volumes
warrant it,'' he said. Retailers can realize a return of $1,000 a
square foot, he added, although industry journals peg the figure
closer to $850. Still, that is triple the average return at a
mainstream mall.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always so lucrative. ``We had a disjointed center,''
said Castagna, whose family construction firm also built the Nassau
Coliseum and the cell blocks at Rikers Island. When Castagna bought
the land that would become the Americana from the developer William
Levitt in 1956, he optimistically incorporated the new center as
the Fifth Avenue of Long Island. As it turned out, he was off by an
avenue and several decades. Among the early tenants were a Magic
Pan and Baker's Shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain point,'' he added, ``we did a study and
discovered that the land was more valuable with no buildings on it.
We started a major move then to go in this direction.'' The
direction was luxury. As it happens, the economy was headed that
way, too.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``the silent cash register is always ringing, silently,''
said a former buyer for Federated Department Stores, which in 1996
opened a $100 million specialty wing of its Bloomingdale's
satellite at the Roosevelt Field mall to compete with Americana's
luxury brands. ``You walk into some of the stores,'' the buyer
added, ``and they're empty. But they've already done $50,000 that
morning, selling sweaters to women who get bored at home and say,
`Let's order some stuff up.'''
</P>
<P>
   The typical Americana consumer, added Lori Hirshleifer Sills,
scion of a retailing business begun at the turn of the century in
Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, ``is very high end. She's a 16 year old
who comes to us for Gucci belts and accessories, and she's a woman
in her 70s who's buying Chanel.'' She is a woman, said Josh Patner,
a co-designer for Tuleh, a label that will soon have its own
miniboutique in Hirshleifer's, ``with a gorgeous car, a gorgeous
home, who loves to look like a woman, and who is married to a man
who loves women to look like women.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one Hirshleifer's customer, Patner said, who owns
``sapphires that match her Rolls.'' What retailer, he said, could
ask for more?

HOW FAMILIAR IS AL GORE WITH TEXAS AND THE TRUTH?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore wants to succeed Bill Clinton as commander in chief, but
his rhetoric suggests that the vice president's main goal is to
replace Slick Willie as the nation's liar in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Gore showed up in Texas last week to disseminate his latest pack
of distortions, deceptions and flat-out falsehoods about George W.
Bush, who just happens to be governor of the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   Topping Gore's list of whoppers was his outrageous claim that
Bush ``made his top priority a large tax cut for special
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's priorities as governor have included any number of
important programs designed to benefit all the people of Texas, but
his ``top priority'' was providing tax relief to the state's
overburdened homeowners. To that end, Bush engineered a $1 billion
reduction in property taxes _ the largest such cut in the state's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Do you suppose that Gore views hard-working Texas taxpayers as
``special interests''?
</P>
<P>
   Sure he does. We know this because Clinton and Gore fight tooth
and nail to defeat every proposal for universal tax relief that
comes down the pike. The only tax cuts you'll ever see these guys
support are those that are ``targeted'' to benefit narrowly
defined, politically favored categories of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   When the vice president bemoans the Bush tax cut, Gore is
complaining about tax cuts for just plain folks.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore travels to Bush's home state to misrepresent the
governor's tax agenda. And while he's at it, Gore claims that Bush
has squandered the state's budget surplus, which may or may not be
as large as originally projected.
</P>
<P>
   Fact No. 1: If giving part of a government budget surplus back
to the people who earned the money in the first place is
``squandering'' the surplus, then we need far more public officials
who are willing to squander.
</P>
<P>
   Fact No. 2: The allegedly diminishing surplus could actually
turn out to be slightly ``larger'' than previous estimates,
according to Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine that Gore doesn't know the truth _ and if
he knows, then he is indeed making an energetic grab for that
``liar in chief'' title. If he isn't lying, of course, we must
assume that he is afflicted with a reckless proclivity for making
unsubstantiated allegations against his opponent _ which casts
serious doubt upon his fitness to serve as America's top elected
official.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who is looking for a clue regarding the level of honesty
in Gore's latest attacks on Bush might want to consider the
fundamental contradiction in his criticism. In addition to ripping
Bush for supposedly squandering the state's surplus, Gore has been
blasting the state for failing to pour enough money into social
programs.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the deal? Is Texas spending too much or not spending
enough?
</P>
<P>
   One more fact: One of the unexpected drains on the state's
finances is higher-than-predicted expenditures for Medicaid, a
massive entitlement program that provides health care for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Shame on Bush and the state of Texas for squandering the budget
surplus on Medicaid recipients. Those ``special interests'' are
insatiable, aren't they?
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that ``Rylander and Texas
legislative leaders from both parties offered to meet Gore in San
Antonio and `brief him on the facts.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the Bush campaign said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore confirmed today that he is not interested in the
truth, but merely interested in political games. Gore refused to
meet with a bipartisan group of Texas budget experts to discuss the
surplus in Texas, and is coming under fire from Texas Democrats who
want Al Gore to quit portraying Texas unfairly.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign quoted Democratic state Rep. Henry Cuellar of
Laredo as saying that Gore's criticism of the state's fiscal
policies amounted to an attack on the Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it amounted to an attack on Texans in general. Lucky
for us, Texas voters get to retaliate on Nov. 7.

FOR KITCHENS WITH CHATEAU ENVY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: recipe at end of article)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many food experts could possibly write a cookbook titled
``From My Chateau Kitchen'' and expect to be taken seriously? Would
anyone not fortunate enough to live in a chateau be able to
duplicate the recipes?
</P>
<P>
   The pretentious tone of the title aside, this book by Anne
Willan (Clarkson Potter, $45) is accessible and reliable. Willan,
the founder of La Varenne, a cooking school, uses her home in
Burgundy, the Chateau du Fey, as La Varenne's summer headquarters
(the American branch of the school, open in winter and spring, is
at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia). Many of the dishes
taught at Chateau du Fey, as well as those Willan serves to friends
and family while in residence, are worth adding to the home cook's
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   This is the most relaxed, charming and personal of the many
books by Willan, an Englishwoman who founded La Varenne in Paris in
1975 as the first school in France designed to teach French cuisine
to Americans. The story of how she and her husband, Mark
Cherniavsky, a retired banker, acquired the chateau, renovated it,
installed the cooking school and won the trust of the suspicious
local farmers and food purveyors is almost a fairy tale. At least
you can work off your envy by cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The book has lavish photographs, with pictures of the lush
countryside and profiles of neighbors in the village of Villecien,
including the chateau caretakers, Roger and Francine Milbert, and
the baker Robert Haumonte. Some were ultimately persuaded to lend
their expertise to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Many alluring seasonal and regional recipes were inspired by
tradition, while others are cutting edge. But local markets and
restaurants seemed to inform all of them. The list of those that
tempted me was long. For the most part the results were successful,
needing almost no adjustment to suit my equipment or taste.
</P>
<P>
   Jambon persille (ham in aspic), a classic dish I had not made in
years, was expertly interpreted for the home kitchen, using
powdered gelatin and American ham, for example. Salmon seared on
its spice-coated skin, then served on a bed of tender julienne
vegetables, was utterly delicious, as was a simple lemon-dressed
salad of slivered squash seasoned with dill.
</P>
<P>
   Rich twice-baked spinach souffles, served in a cream sauce and
topped with cheese, were a convenient marvel when made in advance
and capable of a second rising. In another souffle recipe, the very
idea of using intense and satiny Epoisses cheese was almost too
outrageous; the cheese is rare and a treat eaten on its own. I
passed on that one.
</P>
<P>
   The saving grace in these rich dishes is that the suggested
servings are fairly modest by American standards.
</P>
<P>
   All that a gratin of summer vegetables needed was crusty bread
to sop up its savory herb and olive oil pesto. And though I was
reluctant to consign a couple of pounds of green beans from a farm
stand to a full hour in my wok with some butter, as Willan
recommends for an English-sounding dish called burnt beans, I was
not unhappy with the result (though I did add garlic).
</P>
<P>
   But a whole baked pineapple failed to caramelize as promised.
Perhaps my baking dish was not large enough for the sauce to reduce
properly, but the recipe did not specify dimensions. Thinking that
the 325-degree oven _ which the recipe called for _ might not have
been hot enough, I poured off the sauce, cooked it down on top of
the stove and served it over the fruit to mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The book ends with a wedding, that of the Cherniavskys'
daughter, Emma. A perfect ending for a fairy tale.

192-FOOT CROSS A BEACON OF HOPE TO TRAVELERS IN TEXAS PANHANDLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``On a hill far away, stood an old rugged cross, the emblem of
suffering and shame.''
</P>
<P>
   _ lyrics from ``The Old Rugged Cross'' by George Bennard
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   GROOM, Texas _ Texas Panhandle resident Steve Thomas knows about
suffering. And he has built the state's largest cross _ 192 feet
high _ to remind humans they can overcome suffering and shame too,
just as Christ did centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   The giant white cross, lighted at night on the Texas prairie
just east of Amarillo, is a brilliant beacon for truck drivers and
others seeking solace as they drive down Interstate 40 past the
small town of Groom.
</P>
<P>
   The cross is one of the gargantuan crosses _ including a
100-foot-high cross in Ballinger _ that have been erected across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Those who stop at the gigantic cross at Groom can also pray at
life-size bronze sculptures of the stations of the cross. Also they
can visit a building housing a full-size replica of the Shroud of
Turin, which many believe was the burial cloth of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a half-million people stop at our cross last year,''
Thomas, a structural engineer who owns Caprock Engineering in
Pampa, said last week. ``We've seen big, burly truck drivers stop
by and break down crying. I've seen people praying there on hard
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   I stopped by last week at the cross at Groom, which can be seen
for miles driving down I-40, near the legendary Route 66.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the cross,'' said Jim Moraniec, who wore a broad
smile and a red baseball cap marked by a white cross.
</P>
<P>
   He had just been to early-morning Mass at Immaculate Heart of
Mary Catholic Church in Groom, before taking his turn as a
volunteer host at the cross, completed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had funerals, weddings, prayers for rain, Easter sunrise
services and a Baptist revival here,'' Moraniec said. ``We get a
lot of truck drivers. Some of the most spirited people I've ever
met are truck drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those drivers, Polish-born Marek Wieczorek of Chicago,
came by in his 18-wheeler last week. He wanted to show the cross to
his daughter, Aleksandra, 17, who still lives in Poland but will
soon move to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a blessing to me,'' said Wieczorek. ``I began
stopping by here several years ago when they first started building
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 50, a devout Catholic who builds oil drilling rigs that
have a structure similar to his cross, has spent at least $1.5
million on the project and plans to spend more. He got the idea for
building the cross while driving down Interstate 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many advertisements for Satan along the
highway,'' he said. ``I wanted to build something that would shock
people into thinking about God.''
</P>
<P>
   The cross also illustrates some of the suffering in Thomas' own
life.
</P>
<P>
   In an audiotape telling about Thomas' inspiration to build the
cross, he relates candid stories about his tormented life as a
child because of his alcoholic parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and father were wonderful and caring people as long
as they were sober,'' he said. ``Under the influence of alcohol,
they were different personalities. I remember not sleeping at all
because they would argue until 3 and 4 in the morning. I would get
up and go to school without ever seeing my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, things got worse.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was upstairs sleeping when his emotionally disturbed
father, swinging a claw hammer, severely injured Thomas' mother and
two sisters, and then came upstairs and shot himself with a pistol.
Thomas' father died from the gunshot wound several days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody had his own suffering testimony, and there is a
reason for it,'' Thomas said. ``When an individual suffers greatly,
he can either curse God or come much closer to the loving arms of
Jesus. We as God's creation must suffer in order to take up our
cross and produce good fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also plans to build a Christian pilgrim center near the
cross at Groom, as well as a replica of Jesus' open tomb in the
Holy Land. He praises others who have built large crosses across
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cross at Ballinger gave me the idea to build this cross,''
he said. That cross was built by Jim and Doris Studer.
</P>
<P>
   The largest cross in the world is a 500-foot-high masonry
structure 60 miles north of Madrid, Spain. A cross in St.
Augustine, Fla., is 200 feet high but much smaller in diameter than
the Groom cross.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there is a 110-foot-high cross in southern Illinois and an
80-foot-high cross in northern Michigan, 100 miles north of
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas wants to build a large cross on Interstate 30 between
Fort Worth and Dallas. But for the moment, he is operating The
Cross Ministries in the high plains of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building the cross in Groom has meant more to me than I ever
expected,'' he said. ``I thought I would build it and walk away.
But it has become my life.''

SHOW HUNTING FOR SHAMELESS VIEWERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 1 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surfing, as one will, through the wealth of channels a satellite
or cable service accumulates in its mad dash toward appeasing its
customers, I came upon a poorly written late-night melodrama about
a young, nominally attractive woman who stripped down and had sex
with evil-doers before propelling them on to grim justice. Oh,
yeah, did I mention it was porn?
</P>
<P>
   Eliminate the soft-core titillation element _ and with it,
essentially the only reason for a certain demographic of viewers to
bother to tune in _ and, basically, you have the USA Network's
``The Huntress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Huntress'' _ based on a TV movie that in turn was based on
something that was at some point ostensibly based on real life _
opens with a bounty hunter's widow (Annette O'Toole) having her
teen-age daughter pose as a saucy prostitute to collar a deadbeat
dad.
</P>
<P>
   Not two minutes after seriously compromising the virtue of her
daughter (Jordana Spiro) _ who, since her voice sounds reminiscent
of Brett Butler's, scarcely convinces as an innocent pubescent _
O'Toole asks, ``Where are people's values these days?'' Good
question. She later grouses to her daughter, ``You are becoming so
crude, it breaks my heart.'' Good point.
</P>
<P>
   But good drama it ain't. Our gimmick here is a mom-and-daughter
bounty-hunting team, which sounds more interesting than it plays
out.
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole also opines early on, ``We could sell real estate,'' and
it would likely be just as interesting; certainly, it would be less
derivative. Gary Busey guest-stars as a bounty hunter himself, on
the lam from the law; it's up to O'Toole and Spiro to bring him in,
which they do after surmounting only a few uninteresting obstacles.
(Post-abuse Busey makes for as interesting a performer as, say, you
or I would.)
</P>
<P>
   Bonus trivia factoid: O'Toole, a better actress than Hollywood
ever allowed her to demonstrate, and Busey previously co-starred in
an utterly forgettable romantic comedy titled ``Foolin' Around'' in
1980. History will prove ``The Huntress'' at best an equal to their
earlier collaboration. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
The show: ``The Huntress.'' &QL; 
What: Crime melodrama about mom-and-daughter bounty hunters. &QL; 
Who: Annette O'Toole, Jordana Spiro. &QL; 
Where: USA Network. &QL; 
When: 10 p.m. Wednesdays. &QL;

ADVERTISING: GM TO CONSOLIDATE MEDIA PLANNING AT B COM3 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: this will sub later with an expanded version)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest assignment in the history of advertising was made
Tuesday when General Motors decided to consolidate media planning _
the process of selecting the media in which ads run _ at a new shop
to be formed by a unit of the giant agency company known as the B
Com3 Group. The decision involves assignments with billings
estimated at $2.6 billion for most GM brands, except Saab and
Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to consolidate media planning comes seven years
after GM, the nation's largest advertiser and largest auto maker,
consolidated media buying _ the negotiations to determine how much
ads will cost _ at a shop formed by another Madison Avenue giant,
Interpublic Group of Cos. The goal of such consolidations is to
wring additional economies and efficiencies from the processes that
lead to the delivery of ads to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The media services agency owned by B Com3, Starcom MediaVest,
will form an agency in the Detroit area to specifically handle
media planning for brands like Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile,
Buick, Cadillac and GMC. Until now, those tasks had been divided
among the agencies that create campaigns for the brands, including
Starcom MediaVest siblings like Leo Burnett and D'Arcy Masius
Benton &AMP; Bowles. The creative tasks are unchanged, as is media
buying; the planning will be consolidated at an agency tentatively
named GM Planworks.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, more than 200 people handle the planning tasks,
developing and producing media schedules for each brand based on
the intended consumer audience for that product. GM Planworks,
which is to be fully operating by the first quarter of 2001, is to
have 150 to 200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to select Starcom MediaVest was made by a committee
of seven high-ranking GM marketing and advertising executives.
There were two other agencies under consideration in the review,
which lasted about a month: Interpublic and Carat North America,
part of the Carat unit of Aegis Group.

 &HT;    SOME SCHOOL REFORMS PAY OFF, RAND REPORTS
 &HT;    540&AMP;add. Cox-state inserts at end of story.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some education reforms work better than others,
according to a massive Rand Corporation report released here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the California-based research center concluded
that educational systems in states such as North Carolina, Texas
and Michigan did the best job of improving student achievement
between 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers did not endorse other reforms that had been
introduced during the previous decade in poor-performing states
such as California, Louisiana and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the highest-ranking states had:
</P>
<P>
   _ Higher per-pupil spending.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lower teacher-pupil ratios in the four lowest grades.
</P>
<P>
   _ More teachers with adequate instructional materials and other
resources.
</P>
<P>
   _ Higher attendance at public pre-kindergarten classes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lower teacher turnover.
</P>
<P>
   But they found that some factors accounted for little or none of
the performance gaps between states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other things being equal, higher teacher salaries, higher
teacher educational levels and increased experience (in teaching)
do not show significant effects on achievement,'' said the report.
It also said that teacher aides don't make much difference in how
well a state's students perform.
</P>
<P>
   However, pay levels, education, longevity and help from teacher
aides may be more important in the competition for the best
teachers between school districts within a state, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rand researchers measured achievement by comparing the
average scores from students in 44 states on reading and math tests
administered by the federal government's National Assessment of
Educational Progress. States with big gains or with higher scores
after adjustments for socio-economic differences were rated as
performing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main message is, public schools are reformable,'' said
veteran Rand researcher David Grissmer, who led the three-year
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes more spending to raise academic achievement, but the
additional resources must be well-targeted,'' Grissmer said at the
National Press Club. ``Several states have shown it can be done
with moderate amounts of money if it is done in the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the reforms with the biggest bang for the buck were:
</P>
<P>
   _ In all states, providing adequate classroom materials for all
teachers in kindergarten through eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   _ In states with more disadvantaged students, offering
pre-kindergarten and reducing pupil-teacher ratios in the early
grades below the national average of 21 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   _ In states with an average number of disadvantaged students,
reducing pupil-teacher ratios in the early grades to the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not spending money to hire teacher aides.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The report contains ammunition both for supporters of both
major-party presidential hopefuls, Grissmer said. For example, the
report's conclusions support programs such as the early reading
initiative of Gov. George W. Bush in Texas and the national
class-size reduction program touted by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to them how they spin it,'' Grissmer said. But he said
the report showed that, like other current office-holders, Bush and
Gore can't claim yet that their pet reforms are working, because
``reforms take 10 or 15 years to play out.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, decisions made many years ago helped Texas
students earn much higher scores than California students on NAEP
tests administered from 1990 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   High Texas scores could be traced back to a state commission
headed by Ross Perot, which obtained the expansion of public
pre-kindergarten programs in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Low California scores could be traced back as far as 197nd
increased class size as immigration rates soared.
</P>
<P>
   Published by Rand, ``Improving Student Achievement: What State
NAEP Test Scores Tell Us,'' is based on three years of research
underwritten by the ExxonMobil Foundation, Danforth Foundation and
U.S. Education Department.

A NEW ZEALAND TAKE ON A FRENCH GRAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: a list of recommended wines appears at end of story.) 
 By   ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the last 15 years, New Zealand has earned a
reputation for producing superb sauvignon blancs, yet if you speak
to New Zealand winemakers, you sense they would rather talk about
something else. ``If you think the sauvignon blancs are good, wait
until you taste our chardonnays and pinot noirs,'' they will say.
</P>
<P>
   Their attitude is not difficult to understand. If winemaking
were the Olympics, ever-popular chardonnay and pinot noir would be
center stage at high noon, like the long jump and 100-meter dash,
while sauvignon blanc would be relegated to the wee hours. Who is
ever remembered for winning the badminton competition?
</P>
<P>
   Having tasted some New Zealand chardonnays and pinot noirs, I
think it's fair to say that most of these wines are not yet ready
to compete in the finals. But the sauvignon blancs are another
story.
</P>
<P>
   The best of them combine the vivid citrus and herbal flavors of
Sancerre with a richness and depth that is New Zealand's own
contribution to sauvignon blanc wines.
</P>
<P>
   The better New Zealand sauvignon blancs are also fine food
companions, versatile enough to stand up to the spice of chili
peppers or the power of salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Cloudy Bay is the best-known New Zealand winemaker, and its
sauvignon blancs have excelled year after year, with a predictable
rise in prices. But many other good, less expensive wines are also
available, especially now that the 1999 vintage has come into the
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Sauvignon blancs are excellent when young and fresh. As in
France, the best are fermented in steel tanks, with the flavor
coming from the purity of the fruit, so beware the occasional New
Zealand sauvignon blanc that is labeled barrel-fermented. What you
will taste is a mouthful of oak.
</P>
<P>
   It may be true that, like Olympic badminton athletes, sauvignon
blanc doesn't get the respect it deserves. But, eventually,
excellence of all sorts is rewarded; and, one day, New Zealand will
be able to show off its medals.
</P>

&HT;     EIGHT DAYS OF OLYMPIC TRACK, FIELD QUALIFYING HAD IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Now that eight tense, taut and terrific days of
the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials are over, what kind of team
will America be sending to Sydney for the Games?
</P>
<P>
   A relatively inexperienced one, as it turns out. It's deep in
some events and pathetically shallow in others. Of the 122
available spots on the team in 22 men's events and 20 women's
events, more than half _ 65 to be exact _ went to first-time U.S.
Olympians.
</P>
<P>
   Included among those rookies are such high-profile athletes as
Maurice Greene, Marion Jones and Stacy Dragila, all of whom have
won world championships since the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, it's a typical U.S. team _ strong in the
sprints and hurdles _ but it's also atypically weak in the
horizontal jumps. In fact, this is the weakest contingent of men's
long jumpers and triple jumpers to go to an Olympic Games in many
years; don't expect any medals in these two events.
</P>
<P>
   Among the women, Oakland's Regina Jacobs gives the U.S. team
hope for a medal in an event longer than 400 meters for the first
time since 1992, when Lynn Jennings won bronze at 10,000 meters in
Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   In the just-concluded Olympic trials in Sacramento, Calif.,
Jacobs won the 1,500 and 5,000 in an impressive display of fitness
and fortitude. Jacobs will probably run the 1,500 in Sydney but
there's a chance she'll give the 5,000 a go if she and
husband-coach Tom Craig believe there's a better chance for a medal
in the longer event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regina Jacobs has performed brilliantly in the 5,000 and
1,500,'' said women's coach Karen Dennis of Nevada-Las Vegas. ``I
think our distances, which traditionally have been weak, are much
stronger. We have medal hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   While the surreal crash-and-burn of Greene and Michael Johnson
in their 200-meter showdown Sunday is still fresh in the minds of
those who saw it, it's important to remember that both are heavily
favored to win the gold medal in their individual events.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is the world record holder in the 100 at 9.79 seconds.
Johnson has the world record in the 400 at 43.18. Of the two,
Johnson is a stronger favorite because there is less margin for
error in the 100. Both athletes have two months to recover from the
hamstring horrors that befell them in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy where I am in my career,'' Johnson said. ``I still
got the opportunity to go to Sydney and represent my country. I'll
shift my focus to the 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll focus on 42 seconds. That's all I got left.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be the last Olympics for Johnson, Jacobs, hammer
thrower Lance Deal and decathlete Chris Huffins. Others are just
getting started, like discus thrower Seilala Sua of UCLA, Menlo
Park shot putter Adam Nelson, 400 hurdler Angelo Taylor, sprinter
John Capel and 5,000 runner Brad Hauser of Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Great stories abound on this U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Marla Runyan, who was third in the 1,500 in Sacramento, is
legally blind. At 34, sprinter Floyd Heard returned to competition
after a year off and made his first Olympic team in an individual
event when he finished second to Capel in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   Recent American citizens Mebrahtom Keflezighi (Eritrea) and Abdi
Abdirahman (Somalia) made their new country's Olympic team in the
10,000 meters. At 41 and four years removed from an IAAF doping
suspension, Jud Logan made the team in the hammer but needs to hit
the Olympic ``A'' qualifying standard to go to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   And how about the women's 800, an event where the U.S. will send
three members of the same family to the Olympics? Sisters Hazel
Clark and Joetta Clark Diggs finished 1-3 at Sacramento while their
sister-in-law, Jearl Miles-Clark, split the difference by coming in
second.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the focus in Sydney will be on the telegenic Jones as
she attempts to win an unprecedented five gold medals. She's a lock
for three (100, 200, 4x100 relay) and shaky in the long jump. Her
presence anchoring the 4x400 relay can only bolster the chances of
a U.S. victory in an event where it is not the swiftest country in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to Sydney, men's Olympic coach John Chaplin said,
``I want USA 1-2-3. All other controversies make good copy but it
doesn't mean diddly.''
</P>
<P>
   That was plainly evident in the 200, where a week's worth of
sniping by Johnson and Greene evaporated in the Sacramento sun as
they came up injured, one after the other.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the stressful process of selecting the U.S. team is
over, those who survived can now focus on Sydney, the dream
destination for first-time Olympians and veterans alike.

 &HT;    FOES SAY AOL-TIME WARNER COULD BECOME AN INTERNET TYRANT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Federal Communications Commission reviews
the proposed combination of America Online Inc. and Time Warner
Inc. on Thursday, it will get an earful of boos from merger
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nation's biggest companies, including Walt Disney
Co. and General Electric Co.'s NBC, are asking regulators to limit
the power of a merged AOL Time Warner to prevent creation an
Internet bully.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has been especially aggressive on Capitol Hill, darkly
warning lawmakers and regulators that AOL Time Warner could choke
off competition in ``interactive TV'' _ the place where the
Internet and old-fashioned media are coming together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger will allow AOL to leverage its dominant position in
online Internet services with Time Warner's local cable monopolies
to control the emergent interactive television market,'' Disney
said in an FCC filing submitted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks are just ``more misinformation from our
competitors,'' responded AOL spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan. Disney
executives ``seem more interested in spinning fantasy than in
talking facts,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney is not alone in its complaints. In the seven months
since AOL, the No. 1 Internet service provider, and Time Warner,
one of the world's largest entertainment and news companies,
announced their proposed merger, critics have been growing louder.
</P>
<P>
   Though shareholders of both companies have overwhelmingly
approved the merger, worth roughly $117 billion, the companies
still need the approval of the FCC, as well as the Federal Trade
Commission and the European Union. Each is expected to rule this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Time Warner executives say they are confident of
approval because their companies operate in different markets, and
therefore don't compete. AOL has 23 million online subscribers.
Time Warner owns cable TV operations and media companies that churn
out news and entertainment, such as CNN and Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   But merger opponents say that very combination of content, cable
and online access will lead to a new kind of monopoly. For example,
critics suggest AOL Time Warner might provide quick online
connections to its own content, but slower access to competitors'
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the potential for bullying, Disney points to its
own problems with Time Warner last spring, when the two companies
got into a contract dispute. Time Warner responded to the
disagreement by blacking out Disney's ABC network on the cable
systems it owned.
</P>
<P>
   Then this summer, Disney was rebuffed by Time Warner when it
proposed that the companies try working together to distribute
content.
</P>
<P>
   Now Disney lobbyists are showing a 10-minute video to lawmakers,
spelling out the case against AOL Time Warner in stark, scary
terms. The company is asking the FCC to effectively break up AOL
Time Warner by separating its cable distribution system from the
content-providing operations.
</P>
<P>
   NBC also has filed with the FCC, saying AOL Time Warner should
be forced to provide its online and video competitors with
non-discriminatory access to Time Warner cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's hearing, FCC members will hear testimony from
Disney, as well as other merger critics, such as BellSouth Corp.
and the Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   While media companies are fretting about interactive television,
online companies are complaining about what they call AOL's
``monopolistic'' practices involving its popular instant messaging
system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a group of 16 companies released a policy paper
condemning AOL, saying it has put a virtual stranglehold on instant
messaging, a popular way to send quick notes to online ``buddies.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL's messaging system, with about 50 million users, is bigger
than all of its rivals combined. The 16 companies say AOL's system,
which blocks other instant message users from AOL members, hurts
both consumers and competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In June, AOL told the FCC it supports the idea of allowing its
messaging system to work with others, but said it had to move
slowly to protect its customers' privacy. The competitors, which
include Microsoft Corp.'s MSN, accuse AOL of stalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers deserve the right to communicate freely on the
Internet,'' said Margaret Heffernan, CEO of iCast Corp., one of the
16 instant messaging rivals. ``AOL is robbing IM users of this
right.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, regulators primarily are concerned about the online
delivery of entertainment. That's because AOL has a four-year
agreement with Bertelsmann AG, Germany's largest media company,
guaranteeing that company will have access to AOL as a marketplace
for its music, television and publishing content.
</P>
<P>
   By combining with Time Warner, AOL also will gain ''preferential
access to the leading source of music publishing rights and music
repertoire'' in much of Europe, the European Commission said. Given
that advantage, AOL could become the ''gatekeeper in the emerging
online music distribution channel.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as competitors and consumer advocates continue to
criticize the merger, AOL and Time Warner executives are insisting
they will play fair. In a recent letter to the FCC, the companies
promised to use as many distribution methods as possible. Rather
than trying to force-feed its content through Time Warner cable
lines, the merged company would offer service via digital
subscriber lines and satellite, the letter said.

UNITED PARCEL'S SCHOOL FOR HARD HEARTS, SORT OF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Utah, Texas, Ill., N.Y., Ohio, Ky.)   By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The management epiphany for David Reid came at a center for the
disabled in Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, an operations division manager for United Parcel Service
Inc. in Salt Lake City, got to where he is by getting things done,
and he has not always been sympathetic, he says, to requests from
employees for time off to tend to family matters.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year, while participating in a UPS community
service program for managers, he assisted disabled residents at a
center called Orange Grove. There he worked with a woman who uses a
wheelchair because of cerebral palsy. The entire focus of her life
was to muster enough energy from the only motion she could make, a
slight tilt of her head, to drive the chair. ``It's easy to take
things for granted until you see something like that,'' said Reid,
a 26-year UPS veteran who oversees about 600 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The experience was a moving reminder of the harshness that life
holds for some people, he said, and it made him cringe at the
memory of his own coldheartedness years earlier in dealing with a
part-time employee. The man had called in asking for time off
because his wife was having trouble managing with their disabled
child. Reid told him to get to work or risk losing his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's never too late to learn a lesson,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sort of lesson that United Parcel wants to teach all
its upper managers. With 340,000 employees of every imaginable
ethnic background, the lowest paid of whom start at about $8.50 an
hour, the company invests some $500,000 a year to send managers
through the four-week program.
</P>
<P>
   The program puts them to work with nonprofit organizations in
one of four locations: New York, Chicago, Chattanooga and McAllen,
Texas. Their duties range from building houses with Habitat for
Humanity and visiting rural areas of Appalachia to see the impact
of poverty on children to mentoring young men, boxing food for the
needy and assisting adults with physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate volunteerism in America has been increasing since the
early '90s to the extent that companies even use it in their
marketing. But advocacy groups say it is rare to find a program as
intensive as that devised by United Parcel. Since the program was
created in 1968 in the wake of the civil rights movement, more than
1,200 UPS managers have taken the detour from their ordinary duties
to get a taste of life at the low-income barricades. About 50 will
participate this year.
</P>
<P>
   The program is a much-needed reality check, according to Don
Wofford, a community relations manager in Atlanta who oversees it.
``You can get locked into that `I've got boxes to move and people
to move those boxes' thing,'' he said, ``but those people have to
move themselves, and those people have to be treated fairly and
with dignity to do it well.''
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel makes an effort to send participants to unfamiliar
territory to add zest to the experience. Even so, not all of them
relish it. ``Some individuals have been assigned, and others have
been sentenced,'' Wofford said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Colvard, 42, a division manager in Toledo, Ohio, was one of
the assigned. Colvard recently went to McAllen, about six miles
north of the Mexican border, to work in a poor Hispanic community
at such tasks as serving lunch at a hospice, doing chores at a home
for the elderly and working with incarcerated youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to take an opportunity to try to help a
culture that does not even have the basic entitlements such as food
stamps and Medicaid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While there, he helped build an 18-by-20-foot addition that
doubled the size of a house where a family of seven lived. Although
he and his fellow UPS managers were drilled in basic Spanish,
communicating on the building project at times boiled down to
stretching a tape measure to the length and width desired or
putting an ``X'' on a piece of plywood where a door should go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really find out how good a listener you are when you don't
understand what someone is saying,'' Colvard said. And that effort
has made him a better manager, he says. ``I wasn't as open as I am
now,'' he said. ``I take more time with people, probably to a fault
because I end up with a ton of work left on my desk at 7 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Baumberger, a union steward for two decades in the Toledo
operation, has seen the change in Colvard. ``The man moves so fast
his shadow couldn't keep up,'' Baumberger said. But now, he added,
Colvard seems more relaxed. ``I think he takes time now and slows
down a half a step,'' he said. ``That's good in this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Colvard said the experience had also forced him to take a harder
look at the struggles of people in his workplace. Before he went to
McAllen, he said, he had turned down a temporary worker's request
for a permanent job, calculating that his budget could not handle
the extra expense. But a conversation with the employee at a
vending machine and a review of the case resulted in a change of
heart.
</P>
<P>
   He justified his decision with a mental calculation about the
potential savings in overtime, he said, but the real reason was
that ``it was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he joked: ``I'm closer to my business plan than I've
ever been. If my experience in McAllen has anything to do with
that, I need to go back next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employees find the encounters with the poor so searing that
they do go back. Patti Hobbs, a communications manager working for
the United Parcel airline division in Louisville, Ky., is
organizing a reunion of the group she was in that did a stint last
year at the Henry Street Settlement, a social service agency on the
Lower East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   One highlight, she said, will be a barbecue under the Major
Deegan Expressway like the one they helped a nun set up there for
homeless people. At that event, the executives laid out a feast of
grilled chicken, hamburgers, potato salad, baked beans and even a
birthday cake for a homeless woman named Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Hobbs joined the nun for her nightly run to take food
to the homeless. The nun climbed up a small hill past mounds of
trash four feet tall and called out a man's name, she recalled.
Suddenly, an arm reached from one of the piles and took the food.
</P>
<P>
   The man was a former stockbroker, the nun told her, who had lost
everything, including his family, to cocaine addiction. ``I'll
never forget that as long as I live,'' Hobbs said. ``This is really
an opportunity provided so you don't forget where you came from or
what employees are going through.''

SALES OF EXISTING HOMES RISE, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE REBOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sales of previously owned homes continued rising in
June, helped by a slight pullback in mortgage rates and the
continuing confidence of gainfully employed Americans. Indeed, July
saw a rebound in consumer confidence, driven by Americans' optimism
that jobs will continue to be plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Existing home sales, which account for the bulk of U.S. housing
market activity, rose 2.8 percent in June to a 5.23 million annual
rate, following a 4.3 percent rise in May, the National Association
of Realtors said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer confidence index, a measure of the average
American's comfort with the current economic situation, rose 2.5
points to 141.7 in July after June's 5.5 point decline, the
Conference Board, a private research group, reported Tuesday. The
data are based on a representative sample of 5,000 U.S. households
and measured relative a reading of 100 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Both pieces of data suggest that some key areas of the U.S.
economy might be on the rebound after slumping in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Housing markets and home building had been on the decline for
several months, and policy makers and economists cautiously
believed that higher mortgage rates were curbing American's
home-buying enthusiasm. But the June rebound might suggest
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, June's sharp decline in consumer confidence had been
seen as a sign that consumers, who account for roughly two-thirds
of the nation's economic output, might have been hunkering down in
the face of higher financing rates. But the rebound in confidence
might point to renewed consumer spending activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer confidence readings continue to indicate a strong
overall economy,'' said Lynn Franco, director of consumer research
at the Conference Board. ``Consumers are not only optimistic about
current conditions, but their expectations for the next six months
signal continued low unemployment and minimal inflationary
pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony on monetary policy last week, Federal Reserve
chairman Alan Greenspan said some indications were emerging that
portions of the economy were slowing down. These signs, he said,
include higher household debt, the near-saturation of consumers'
appetite for long-lasting durable goods like automobiles and
appliances, and stagnating stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan also warned that growth might accelerate again,
leading to renewed efforts by the central bank to raise interest
rates to slow economic growth to a sustainable level. Greenspan
also warned that the recent strength in consumer confidence and
home sales activity could be a sign that the economy might be
heating again.
</P>
<P>
   Some economist held a similar view. ``As long as consumer
confidence stays high, which we believe it will provided that the
labor markets stay strong and the stock market does not collapse,
consumption growth is likely to reaccelerate in the coming
months,'' said Joseph LaVorgna, senior economist at Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised short-term interest rates six times in the
past year in an attempt make it more costly for consumers and
businesses to borrow and spend. By slowing spending, the Fed hoped
to put supply and demand back into balance, reducing the risk of
inflation that occurs when too many dollars chase a steady amount
of goods. At its most recent meeting in June, the Fed's
policymaking committee decided to keep interest rates steady,
citing several slowing areas of the economy.

TEXAS TOWN DIGGING IN TO HELP LAY WATERLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 21-mile ditch being scratched across West Texas from
Throckmorton to Elbert is 99.9 percent finished. Just a few
stubborn rocks remain, and they'll soon be dislodged.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Throckmorton, 125 miles northwest of Fort
Worth, are eagerly looking forward to Friday, when the last length
of pipe will be laid in that ditch and life-giving water can once
again flow freely to the town.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are dirty and lawns are brown in Throckmorton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got almost 9 miles of pipe laid right now,'' said
Kelly Bowlin, the assistant city secretary. ``They should be
through by Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   The town normally draws its water from nearby Lake Throckmorton,
but Elm Creek, which feeds the lake, is bone dry. The watershed is
a small one, and it never captured enough spring rain to battle
heavy summer usage and triple-digit heat.
</P>
<P>
   City officials recently measured the lake and found that they
had only two months' water supply left. The state declared
Throckmorton a disaster area, and the city began searching for more
water.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Graham agreed to sell Throckmorton during emergency
conditions about 125,000 gallons of water a day from its Fort
Belknap Water Supply Corp. in Elbert.
</P>
<P>
   Throckmorton got an $800,000 grant from the state for a new
pipeline, but the estimated cost of the project hovered above $2
million. The town asked for volunteers to help lessen the cost, and
it got them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a man from Pennsylvania out there yesterday,'' Bowlin
said. ``It was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past week, hundreds of volunteers have come and gone
along the pipeline route, and the call for volunteers has been
replaced with a call for money to help feed them.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross chapter from Abilene set up in Throckmorton to
help feed the workers, along with members of the Texas Baptist
Men's Association from Wichita, Archer and Clay counties. The Red
Cross chapter in Wichita Falls also sent support.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist men are doing the cooking. The Red Cross is handling
the shopping and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pipeline has been progressing nicely _ they're ahead of
schedule _ and we've been feeding folks and making sure they're
getting their liquids,'' said Brian Aird, executive director of the
Abilene Red Cross chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a number of drives for water and Gatorade _ we've
got that covered _ but we need funds so we can buy food in bulk.''
</P>
<P>
   Aird said the meals are costing $3.33 each. The daily total has
been running $700.
</P>
<P>
   The menu has run from chicken to hot dogs and hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial estimate for the pipeline project was about two
weeks,'' Aird said. ``We felt we needed about $15,000.'' So far,
the chapter has raised about $4,300, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time in recent memory that the Red Cross has
helped in a drought-relief effort, Aird said. But given the
scarcity of water across the state, it may not be the last.
</P>
<P>
   Throckmorton residents are pitching in as well. Along with
locals who have manned the ditch-digging and pipe-laying equipment,
others are making sandwiches and hauling water.
</P>
<P>
   Several women in town are making desserts to go out with the
lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Bowlin, a 17-year-old Throckmorton resident has made the
pipeline project a family affair. Her mother, Kelly, is helping at
City Hall, and her dad, Steve, is the town's public works director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ashley has been driving up and down that pipeline every day,''
her mother said. ``She has kind of adopted some of the volunteers.
Every day she finds a new one. She makes sure they get what they
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in Throckmorton appreciate the help.''

GREAT SCRIPT LURES ANDRE BRAUGHER TO `GIDEON'S CROSSING'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKI TURNER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It was two years ago that Andre Braugher laid
out the criterion for his return to series television: He said he
would only consider working on shows shot on the East Coast, where
he lives with his wife, actress Ami Brabson, and two small sons.
The Chicago-born, Juilliard-trained thespian doesn't care much for
Los Angeles. It's far too pretentious for his tastes, he says. And,
as an avid angler, Braugher prefers fishing in the lakes near his
northern New Jersey home.
</P>
<P>
   Braugher was shooting ``Passing Glory'' at the time. The TNT
film was the first television project he'd done since leaving his
Emmy Award-winning role as Detective Frank Pembleton on NBC's
critically acclaimed, but ratings-challenged drama ``Homicide: Life
on the Streets.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, after reading the script for ABC's new drama ``Gideon's
Crossing,'' and checking with the ``commander'' (his wife),
Braugher, 38, has headed west again. He went alone, however,
because he didn't want to uproot his sons again or have his wife
sacrifice her career goals for his.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my agent called and said he had a script he thought I
should read, my first question was where was it shooting,''
Braugher said between sessions at the Television Critics
Association press tour. When he learned it was Los Angeles, he
said, ``Well, then I don't even know if we need to read it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Braugher read the script anyway and immediately knew he
wanted to do it. ``(My wife) and I understood that this was
material that couldn't be refused,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gideon's Crossing'' is a hospital drama starring Braugher as
an unorthodox chief of experimental medicine at a prestigious
Boston teaching hospital that is often the last hope for critically
ill patients. Ben Gideon's passion for healing has been intensified
by the recent death of his wife to ovarian cancer. The pilot
episode does a masterful job of exploring his motivations
professionally and personally. At work we see him trying to
persuade dying patients to fight; at home we observe him trying to
come to grips with the fact that he couldn't get his wife to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Dr. Jerome Groopman's book, ``The Measure of Our
Days,'' the show also stars Russell Hornsby, Rhona Mitra, Eric
Dane, Hamish Linklater, Ravi Kapoor and Sophie Keller; and reunites
Braugher with ``Homicide'' creator Paul Attanasio, ``Gideon's''
executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brilliant writer and his reputation alone was
sufficient to make me come out here,'' Braugher says of Attanasio.
``He has proven to be very talented, tasteful, hard-working and
sane. A man couldn't wish for a better executive producer.''
</P>
<P>
   You're likely to see shades of Pembleton in Ben Gideon. ``I love
(playing) men with flaws,'' Braugher says. Both are intense. But,
as Braugher says, the difference between them is that ``Gideon is
going into the very place that Pembleton is exiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we'll see on a weekly basis is the transformation
of Ben Gideon into himself,'' Braugher says. ``He has been through
the crossing. The Ben Gideon we would have met two or three years
down the line was not as fine a doctor as the man we meet today.''
</P>
<P>
   Braugher quit ``Homicide'' after six seasons in 1998, deciding
he'd had enough of Pembleton's issues. ``I thought it was time to
go on to a new challenge,'' he said. ``The trap of playing an
episodic character for too long is that the character begins to
play you.''
</P>
<P>
   The versatile actor has since appeared in two TV movies _
``Passing Glory'' and Showtime's ``Love Songs,'' _ and the feature
films ``Frequency,'' the upcoming ``Duets'' and ``A Better Way to
Die.'' Despite steady work, however, he says the quality of feature
film scripts sent his way leaves much to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty poor,'' he says. ``In terms of television,
there's been some good scripts and some interesting ones, but
(`Gideon's Crossing') is the highest caliber I've seen in a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Attanasio says he's glad Braugher felt compelled to do this
series. ``What we were really looking at in casting the part of Dr.
Ben Gideon was the essences of that character,'' he says. ``He had
to be somebody who had a real toughness and command, but who also
had warmth and a depth and a humanity.'' Braugher captures those
traits and ``is just a joy to write for.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that will be enough for Braugher to stick around for a
while. ``Past performances are no indication of future results so
I'll burn that bridge when I get to it,'' he says. ``We'll see how
it goes episode by episode and go from there.''

CIRCUIT CITY TO EXIT APPLIANCE BIZ, LAYOFFS EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMIE PATON   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Circuit City(CC:NYSE) announced Tuesday that it would
abandon its sluggish appliance business, concentrating instead on
electronics and home office products, as part of a realignment that
will lead to the loss of 1,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year plan, which calls for the remodeling of virtually
all of the company's 573 superstores nationwide, would depress
earnings in both the second and third quarters of this year,
Circuit City said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after excluding restructuring costs, second-quarter profit
still would fall well below Wall Street's expectations, mainly
because of slumping appliance sales, the Richmond, Va.-based
company warned.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City anticipated second-quarter earnings of 32 cents a
share, before one-time charges of $30 million, down from 35 cents a
share from last year. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial, meanwhile, had predicted earnings of 43 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   In the announcement, Circuit City offered a brighter prognosis
for its fourth quarter, but the news of the restructuring rattled
investors, driving Circuit City's shares down 5 11/16, or 17
percent, to 26 15/16 Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sustained strength in the sales of electronics and home office
supplies, the company said, contrasted sharply with the slow growth
recently in the appliance sector, hastening the decision to pull
appliances from the stores.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of appliances made up nearly 14 percent of total sales
last year, ``but its profitability was below average,'' Circuit
City's president and chief executive, W. Alan McCollough, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the company's superstores will be remodeled under
the plan, the company said. In addition, six distribution centers
will be closed by the end of this year and two more will be shut
down over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The remodeling of central and south Florida stores already under
way is expected to cost $15 million before taxes and lower
second-quarter earnings by 3 cents a share and third-quarter profit
by 2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City, which operates 43 mall-based shops in addition to
its superstores, expects that earnings in the fourth quarter will
reflect the new emphasis on the more profitable consumer
electronics and home office products.
</P>
<P>
   The company anticipates a more prosperous future, with
fourth-quarter earnings of 98 cents a share and fiscal year
earnings _ including the one-time charges _ of $1.60 a share, still
below analysts' estimates of $1.99 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, fellow retailer Kmart is suffering through rough
times of its own as it announced an earnings warning and
restructuring plan Tuesday morning.

SOME VIDEO GAMES SPAWN SEQUEL AFTER SEQUEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some video games _ OK, a lot of video games _ never die.
Instead, they reproduce, spawning sequel after sequel. Three recent
examples of games that refuse to die:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mortal Kombat Special Forces'' (Midway for PlayStation): One
of the oldest fighting games this side of ``Street Fighter,''
Midway's ``Mortal Kombat'' takes on a new face for this, its fifth
``MK'' game.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being a straightforward, head-to-head, fist-to-fist
fighter, ``Special Forces'' is an action/adventure game along the
lines of ``Tomb Raider.'' Players take on the role of Jax, the
steel-armed character from ``MK II'' who's out to settle a score
with longtime rival Kano.
</P>
<P>
   Kano's hidden somewhere in a ``Doom''-influenced complex that's
littered with bad guys. Players must battle the goons using
hand-to-hand combat and guns as they make their way to the grand
showdown against Kano.
</P>
<P>
   Not much here resembles the old ``Mortal Kombat''; it's an
entirely different _ and much more satisfying _ game. The only
leftover from the old ``MKs'': the fighting. As with the
traditional ``MK'' titles, players use special combo moves to
thwart enemies. Unfortunately, there are no humorous finishing
moves. Bummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rampage Through Time'' (Midway for PlayStation): ``Rampage''
is an old, old, old arcade game that was as simple as it was fun.
Players controlled monsters _ based on Hollywood heroes like King
Kong and Godzilla _ who gathered points by smashing city buildings
to bits. You even got to gobble up people. Yeah, it was pretty
cool.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ``Rampage'' game pays homage to the original, but
with a futuristic twist. Now the monsters are traveling through
time, destroying cities from different time eras, like ancient
Egypt. That's cool.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 cities await the monsters' stomping and pounding,
all of which are nicely detailed _ that is, until you rip 'em to
shreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street Fighter III Double Impact'' (Capcom for Sega
Dreamcast): This is actually two games in one: ``New Generation''
and ``Second Impact,'' both culled from the ``Street Fighter III''
series. Yes, keeping track of all the ``Street Fighter'' games is
confusing. Pity the poor birthday-present-hunting parent who's
gotta figure out which ``Street Fighter'' game their kid
``doesn't'' have.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the current crop of three-dimensional, high-tech
fighting games will yawn at the crudeness of ``Street Fighter
III,'' but real fighting enthusiasts know that the flat graphics
don't mean flat game play.
</P>
<P>
   These are fast and furious games in which strategy and timing
are essential. Whereas most fighting titles play up easy-to-use
combo moves that can wipe out an opponent instantaneously, these
focus on individual kicks and punches. So what if the graphics look
like they were pulled from a comic book? This is far more realistic
fighting than anything else out there.

 &HT;    FOES SAY AOL-TIME WARNER COULD BECOME AN INTERNET TYRANT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Federal Communications Commission reviews
the proposed combination of America Online Inc. and Time Warner
Inc. on Thursday, it will get an earful of boos from merger
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nation's biggest companies, including Walt Disney
Co. and General Electric Co.'s NBC, are asking regulators to limit
the power of a merged AOL Time Warner to prevent creation an
Internet bully.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has been especially aggressive on Capitol Hill, darkly
warning lawmakers and regulators that AOL Time Warner could choke
off competition in ``interactive TV'' _ the place where the
Internet and old-fashioned media are coming together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger will allow AOL to leverage its dominant position in
online Internet services with Time Warner's local cable monopolies
to control the emergent interactive television market,'' Disney
said in an FCC filing submitted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks are just ``more misinformation from our
competitors,'' responded AOL spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan. Disney
executives ``seem more interested in spinning fantasy than in
talking facts,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney is not alone in its complaints. In the seven months
since AOL, the No. 1 Internet service provider, and Time Warner,
one of the world's largest entertainment and news companies,
announced their proposed merger, critics have been growing louder.
</P>
<P>
   Ths will hear testimony from Disney, as well as other merger
critics, such as BellSouth Corp. and the Consumer Federation of
America.
</P>
<P>
   While media companies are fretting about interactive television,
online companies are complaining about what they call AOL's
``monopolistic'' practices involving its popular instant messaging
system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a group of 16 companies released a policy paper
condemning AOL, saying it has put a virtual stranglehold on instant
messaging, a popular way to send quick notes to online ``buddies.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL's messaging system, with about 50 million users, is bigger
than all of its rivals combined. The 16 companies say AOL's system,
which blocks other instant message users from AOL members, hurts
both consumers and competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In June, AOL told the FCC it supports the idea of allowing its
messaging system to work with others, but said it had to move
slowly to protect its cu

 &HT;    CONGRESS SEEKS FASTER HDTV ROLLOUT
 &HT;    Moving in the (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two key members of Congress warned the nation's
broadcasters Tuesday that they could lose their free access to the
airwaves if they fail to make good on promises to roll out full
high-definition television (HDTV) programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would be making a very big mistake by keeping these
next-generation TV services from the American consumer,'' said Rep.
Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the telecommunications
subcommittee, at a hearing called to review the current muddled
state of digital broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin's remarks were echoed by Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., who
chairs the parent House Commerce Committee. ``The picture of HDTV
still has some analog snow,'' Bliley said. ``There are
disagreements at the (Federal Communications Commission) and within
the industry over HDTV. Not only do these issues stall the sale of
new television sets, but these internal squabbles prevent digital
television from being a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress originally set 2006 as a deadline for the conversion of
the nation's TV signals to an all-digital standard, scapping the
analog system that has been in place since 1939.
</P>
<P>
   As the hearing ended, Tauzin said the broadcasters ``run the
risk of Congress claiming the (digital) spectrum back'' if they
sought to market the allocated band for subscription services ``and
not show the American public HDTV.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Bliley, ``It would be a mockery of the laws passed by this
Congress to allow the broadcasters to create secondary markets for
the spectrum they should return to the FCC as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin summoned an 11-member panel of witnesses to testify. It
reflected the full range of industry and government views on such
thorny HDTV issues as ``must carry'' cable rules and digital
transmission techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Since digital broadcasting began some 20 month ago, only 34,000
HDTV-capable sets have been sold, joining the nation's stockpile of
250 million analog models, Mark Hyman, an executive at
Baltimore-based Sinclair Broadcasting Group, noted.
</P>
<P>
   Although the price of some new sets has fallen to around $2,000,
most major networks have been slow in offering extensive HDTV
content. Some pullbacks, such as ABC's decision to no longer air
``Monday Night Football'' in HDTV, have also taken place.
</P>
<P>
   With some support from the major networks, Sinclair is
campaigning to add as an option to the current digital transmission
standard the one now being used in Europe, Asia and South America.
While similar, the two systems are mutually incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   In what Tauzin cited as ``an engineering duel that I hoped to
avoid,'' the proponents of the rival HDTV standards _ in league
with several digital commercial and public stations here _ sought
to demonstrate to the legislators their respective claimed virtues
and purported drawbacks in on-the-air tests.
</P>
<P>
   But in a July 24 letter to the National Association of
Broadcasters, FCC Chairman William Kennard argued that current
digital standard is ``superior'' to the one championed by Sinclair.
Any further changes in the technology, Kennard warned, ``could lead
to uncertainty that might jeopardize the ultimate success of the
transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Testifying on behalf of the set makers, Gary Shapiro, head of
the Consumer Electronics Association, said: ``The American ...
standard has sufficient headroom and flexibility to accommodate new
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that the broadcasters have recently modified
their business plans to put more emphasis on data services, we ask
them to use the American standard in a way that will be compatible
with existing equipment,'' he said.

   Added Bliley, ``It would be a mockery of the laws passed by this
Congress to allow the broadcasters to create secondary markets for
the spectrum they should return to the FCC as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin summoned an 11-member panel of witnesses to testify. It
reflected the full range of industry and government views on such
thorny HDTV issues as ``must carry'' cable rules and digital
transmission techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Since digital broadcasting began some 20 month ago, only 34,000
HDTV-capable sets have been sold, joining the nation's stockpile of
250 million analog models, Mark Hyman, an executive at
Baltimore-based Sinclair Broadcasting Group, noted.
</P>
<P>
   Although the price of some new sets has fallen to around $2,000,
most major networks have been slow in offering extensive HDTV
content. Some pullbacks, such as ABC's decision to no longer air
``Monday Night Football'' in HDTV, have also taken place.
</P>
<P>
   With some support from the major networks, Sinclair is
campaigning to add as an option to the current digital transmission
standard the one now being used in Europe, Asia and South America.
While similar, the two systems are mutually incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   In what Tauzin cited as ``an engineering duel that I hoped to
avoid,'' the proponents of the rival HDTV standards _ in league
with several digital commercial and public stations here _ sought
to demonstrate to the legislators their respective claimed virtues
and purported drawbacks in on-the-air tests.
</P>
<P>
   But in a July 24 letter to the National Association of
Broadcasters, FCC Chairman William Kennard argued that current
digital standard is ``superior'' to the one championed by Sinclair.
Any further changes in the technology, Kennard warned, ``could lead
to uncertainty that might jeopardize the ultimate success of the
transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Testifying on behalf of the set makers, Gary Shapiro, head of
the Consumer Electronics Association, said: ``The American ...
standard has sufficient headroom and flexibility to accommodate new
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that the broadcasters have recently modified
their business plans to put more emphasis on data services, we ask
them to use the American standard in a way that will be compatible
with existing equipment,'' he said.

NOTIONS OF PROPERTY TIE UP DANCE LEGACIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of dancers recently asked the longtime stage manager
Maxine Glorsky for a list of choreographers whose work she would
like to see performed at ``Party for Max,'' a celebration of her
60th birthday at the Joyce Theater in September. Most readily
agreed to having their work performed on the program. But dance by
two major choreographers she named will not be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been impossible to pursue'' a piece by Martha
Graham, said Richard Daniels, one of the tribute planners, in view
of bitter ongoing battles between the Graham board and dancers and
Ron Protas, head of the Martha Graham Trust, which licenses her
dances.
</P>
<P>
   And the fee to restage a piece by the West Coast choreographer
Lester Horton, which included travel from California for a restager
designated by Lester Horton Dance Theater, was more than the cost
of the tribute itself. Luckily, Glorsky did not ask for a piece by
Erick Hawkins, who died intestate in 1994. The ownership of his
work is still in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a dance isn't danced, does it really exist?'' Daniels
asked. His question is rhetorical but valid.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the chief impediment to reviving dances
was that the work was out of fashion. Now, death and the notion of
ownership have seemingly created even more insurmountable problems.
</P>
<P>
   Growing sophistication about preserving the legacy of dance has
to a large extent institutionalized the handing-down of
choreography, which was first passed down from dancer to dancer,
then by written notation and film and video. The idea of owning a
dance as property is relatively new. Changes in copyright law that
went into effect in 1978 are partly responsible for that notion; so
is an increasing general interest in copyright and ownership as new
media widen the possibilities for illegally appropriating the
artistic property of others.
</P>
<P>
   An era died with Graham. The ownership of her dances is
emotionally fraught. In recent months, the Graham board has
effectively closed down the operations of its senior and junior
companies and school and removed Protas, who inherited Graham's
dances and the right to her name on her death in 1991, from the
board. Engagements in the United States and abroad have been
canceled. Protas has denied the company and its dancers the right
to perform the choreography. And the dancers have appealed to
institutions and individuals worldwide to boycott the works. The
trust is expected to take legal action soon.
</P>
<P>
   Horton, an innovative modern-dance choreographer with a
distinctive movement style, died in 1953. Frank Eng, to whom Horton
left his works, created the Horton foundation last year and
appointed Don Martin, a former Horton dancer, to stage the pieces.
``My only interest at this point is to reconstruct and hand down
the most accurate material possible,'' Eng said.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is raising money to train a group of Horton
restagers who will be able to assist Martin. But first- and
second-generation Horton performers and teachers scattered across
the United States complain that they know at least as much about
the dances as Martin does and are eager to recreate Horton's
seldom-seen works and teach his technique before they vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographers of Horton's era often did not bother to arrange
for their work to live on after their death. Charles Weidman, who
formed a pioneering modern-dance company with Doris Humphrey in
1928, did not leave a will when he died in 1973. Eventually the New
York State Surrogate Court's public administrator gave his dance
material to a newly formed foundation that is responsible for their
restaging today.
</P>
<P>
   Most living choreographers own their own dances and license them
through their companies or foundations. Though choreographers have
been fond of proclaiming that they do not want their work to live
on after them, some do make provisions. George Balanchine left his
dances to colleagues, who restage them for ballet companies
throughout the world under the aegis of the Balanchine Trust,
formed in 1987 and considered a model in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey left her dances to her son, Charles Woodford, who
arranged for their licensing through the Dance Notation Bureau, a
center in Manhattan for the preservation of choreography and dance
techniques through written notation. The bureau also handles the
smaller ballets of Antony Tudor and works with the Weidman
Foundation. Jose Limon, a leading modern-dance choreographer who
died in 1972, did not mention his works in his will. They were
divided among his heirs and sold back to the Jose Limon Dance
Foundation, which is now responsible for their licensing.
</P>
<P>
   But no will has been found for Hawkins' widow, the composer
Lucia Dlugoszewski, who died suddenly in April. The public
administrator must now provide for the disposal not only of the
dances, sets and costumes but also of Dlugoszewski's scores, many
of which were an integral part of Hawkins' choreography and
aesthetic. The process can be long, depending partly on whether
heirs exist with solid claims to the estate. Katherine Duke, who
now heads the Hawkins company, says that the dancers are ready to
perform. She has also had requests to restage Hawkins' work. ``At
the moment, everything is still in the hands of the state,'' she
said. ``And they're not making any promises.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Even going by the rules can be difficult. Dances go into the
public domain 70 years after the choreographer's death. Work
created before 1909 is automatically considered to be in the public
domain. Later amendments or additions of new material are
copyrighted by the choreographer who creates the additions, and
this has raised legal questions of ownership. Similarly, who owns a
dance made by a staff choreographer for a specific company?
</P>
<P>
   Choreographers have always taken material from one another, and
even the new copyright law cannot prevent that entirely. What the
law did do was to make it easier to copyright a dance, to turn it
into property. Before the changes, dances could be registered for
copyright through often cumbersome and imprecise written
descriptions, the most reliable of which were notated dance
``scores.'' ``It was like trying to get copyright protection by
publishing the libretto,'' said Theodore Striggles, an arts and
intellectual property lawyer and former dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a simple rehearsal film or videotape is enough to ``fix''
or establish the entity of a work. ``In theory, the moment the film
was made there was sufficient fixation,'' Striggles said, ``which
left everything protected that was ever filmed except for
improvisation.'' Those in dance know that they may risk legal
problems if they fold even a few taped moments of Paul Taylor's
version of ``Le Sacre du Printemps'' into a documentary without
getting permission from Taylor and the estate of the composer Igor
Stravinsky, even if the documentary is being made by a deserving
nonprofit arts institution.
</P>
<P>
   It is even possible to trademark a choreographer's name, as has
been done by the Martha Graham Trust and the Alvin Ailey American
Dance Theater Foundation. The Ailey board bought the rights to
Ailey's dances from his mother, to whom the choreographer had left
them, and the rights to his name from his step-brother. ``The board
felt the dances had to be owned by a nonprofit institution and not
a single person, who could sell `Revelations' to the Rockettes,''
said Sharon Luckman, executive director of the Ailey company. But
``Revelations'' and another early classic, ``Blues Suite,'' are
never licensed to other companies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Who should own a dance? It could be argued that any art might be
described as the intellectual property of a nation after its
creator's death, particularly if it has been made with public
funds. It could also be argued that the old-time dancers who have
gathered regularly over the decades to reconstruct lost works by
long-dead choreographers, relying on their own muscle memory,
should be entitled to some portion of ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Thorny aesthetic questions must often also be addressed. Duke,
the Hawkins dancer, wonders whether companies willing to undertake
the cost of performing the works to live music should get a
reduction in the licensing fee. ``Erick and Lucy lived for live
music,'' she said. ``Some in the company feel the dances will never
be seen if we demand that they be done to live music.''
</P>
<P>
   Choreographers tend to tinker with and rework dances long after
their premieres. Which version of a dance should be considered the
authentic property? Sally Bliss, the head of the Tudor Trust in St.
Louis, Mo., was faced with a difficult question when the Jose Limon
Dance Company asked for Tudor's ``Dark Elegies.''
</P>
<P>
   The dance had been created for a ballet troupe, with the women
performing it on point. Would the flat modern-dance slippers of the
Limon company violate the aesthetic of the piece? She decided to
license the piece to Limon because she felt ``Dark Elegies'' also
needed the kind of physical weight that the modern-dance company
would bring to the piece. (Ballet is airborne; modern dance
traditionally is earthbound.)
</P>
<P>
   The Tudor foundation is known as one of the most generous of
licensing institutions. Bliss charges from $6,000 to $10,000,
depending in part on the size and prominence of the company, for a
three- to six-year contract, with a standard $100 per-performance
royalty fee. Videotapes can only be used for restaging if the
restager has danced a role in the ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says I should raise the fees, but people say they
can't afford it and I believe them,'' said Bliss, a former Tudor
dancer and friend. ``I think it's wonderful so many people are
doing Tudor.'' She gives regional companies a longer contract
because they perform less frequently than big-city troupes. ``The
regionals can't do a work again the next year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, fees for the licensing of the dance alone, which
does not include music rights, costumes and scenery rentals and
some other expenses, range from $1,000 per minute, the Horton
foundation's charge, to a scale of $10,000 to $50,000 for one to
three-year contracts. A few choreographers go as high as $100,000.
Factors in determining the fee can also include the length and
complexity of the work, the number of performances and the size of
the geographical area in which the dance will be performed.
</P>
<P>
   Most restagers are longtime performers of the dances who have
often been chosen by the choreographers themselves. The Ailey
company often sends Masazumi Chaya, its associate artistic director
and chief restager, to inspect a company before it acquires its
first Ailey dance.
</P>
<P>
   Once a dance is licensed, it must also be maintained. Changes
inevitably creep in, whether through sloppiness or individual
interpretation. Many licensing institutions require that the
company train an in-house regisseur or ballet master who will
continue to monitor the performing level and correctness of the
work. The Manhattan-based Nikolais-Louis Foundation for Dance
requires that any revival of a work by Alwin Nikolais or Murray
Louis two years after its staging must be restaged by the
designated reconstructor.
</P>
<P>
   Dance companies tend to change their full complement of
performers and staff every two years, Louis said. And unlike
companies that perform only the work of their founding
choreographers, repertory companies dance a variety of styles.
``The internal coloration of a dance can be lost,'' Louis said.
``Dancers remember what but not how.''
</P>
<P>
   Money is less an issue, many say believably, than trying to keep
the dances alive in as authentic a version as possible. ``The point
is to disseminate, not to be billionaires,'' said Jane Hermann, the
director of dance at International Creative Management. ``It's a
judgment call as to how best to disseminate the work.''

QUALCOMM TO SPIN OFF CHIP UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Stock prices are not up-to-the-minute) 
 By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Predicting a period of robust growth in the wireless
communications business brought about by demand for untethered
Internet access, Qualcomm (QCOM:Nasdaq) officials said Tuesday that
they will spin off the company's semiconductor business.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will bear responsibility for making the
technological guts of wireless handsets, leaving Qualcomm to
concentrate on developing wireless Internet technologies and
promoting Code-Division Multiple Access, an encoding system known
by the acronym CDMA.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm, which has more than 1,000 patents and patent
applications for elements of CDMA, said it will transfer some of
those to the new company. It also offered tacit acknowledgement
that Global System for Mobile Communications, a rival encoding
system known by the acronym GSM, presents a threat. Qualcomm said
the new company will use CDMA patents to gain access to GSM
technology by negotiating cross-licenses.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Richard Sulipizio, president
and chief operating officer of Qualcomm, said that the move does
not imply CDMA's importance has diminished. ``There is no question
in anybody's mind that CDMA, in any flavor, is the future of
wireless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years from now you will be able to tell your friends and
relatives that you were at the launch of what will become the
largest telecommunications semiconductor business in the world,''
Sulpizio said. ``We now will have more effective access to
third-party technology.''
</P>
<P>
   CDMA, developed by Allied intelligence officials in World War
II, sends signals across a full spectrum, distinguishing each by a
random digital sequence. In contrast, GSM and many other
technologies assign a specific frequency to each user. Qualcomm
created communications chips for the classified CDMA technology,
then claimed the initial patents when the technology became
publicly known.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm will continue to file patent applications for and
generate royalties from CDMA, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wireless industry is on the verge of its next major growth
phase based on wireless Internet access,'' said Dr. Irwin M.
Jacobs, chairman and chief executive officer of Qualcomm, in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-based Qualcomm said it intends to distribute stock in
the new company to its shareholders in the form of a tax-free
dividend by August 2001. The plan must be approved by Qualcomm's
directors, and the Internal Revenue Service could block the
tax-free aspects. The company reserved the right to call off the
transfer should market conditions change.
</P>
<P>
   It has yet to name the new business. Jacobs will also serve as
chairman of the new company. Its chief executive will be Sulpizio.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came less than a week after Qualcomm reported
earnings that met Wall Street's expectations. On Monday, Texas
Instruments (TXN:NYSE), the top U.S. maker of computer chips for
wireless phones, predicted accelerated sequential growth in
semiconductor sales and revenue growth in the wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm shares gained 3 1/4, or 5 percent, to 66 7/8 in midday
trading.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PECONIC, N.Y. _ It's high summer out here on the North Fork of
Long Island. The corn is sweet, the first peaches are in, and in
the vineyards, the still-green merlot and cabernet franc are
looking good. It will be long weeks, maybe two months, before the
pickers arrive and the air grows heady with the seductive aroma of
crushed grapes.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be deceived by the bucolic calm. The Long Island wine
business is booming; it's almost giddy from its own success.
Handsome new wineries are opening, old ones are changing hands for
astonishing prices, new vineyards are springing up from Aquebogue
to Greenport, and suddenly, there isn't enough wine to go around.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, these developments are not due to the hesitant
little band of artisans and amateurs who started it all in
converted barns and potato fields some 30 years ago, seeking a
simpler agrarian lifestyle, so they thought. The current scene is
made up of self-assured professionals backed by deep-pocketed
investors, who are also seeking a different lifestyle _ as owners
of Napa Valley-like showcase wineries making prize-winning and
sought-after wines.
</P>
<P>
   World class wines may be a few years away, but the money, the
talent and the will to make them are all in place. It is, everyone
out here will tell you, just a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   I'm inclined to agree, with a few reservations. Seven of every
10 bottles of wine Americans consume is California wine. California
wines, for the most part, are jammy, full-bodied, velvety and
relatively easy to drink. Fat, buttery chardonnay is the paradigm.
Long Island wines, at their best, are just as intense, but are
leaner, less voluptuous. Perhaps more elegant. They are a different
taste experience, and for many wine fans they take some getting
used to.
</P>
<P>
   The North Fork is a narrow strip of farmland on eastern Long
Island between Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay, about 70 miles
from Manhattan. In 1970 it was on the brink of the same drab
suburbanization that had already overwhelmed Nassau County and much
of western Suffolk. Then the affluent and photogenic Alex and
Louisa Hargrave, children of the 1960s, arrived, wanting to go
``back to the land.'' They founded Hargrave Vineyard in Cutchogue,
and almost miraculously, other vineyards soon followed, bringing
new life to the faltering agricultural economy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, vineyard land totals about 2,800 acres, of which about
2,200 are in production. Annual wine production, still negligible,
is estimated to be 300,000 cases, about the same as for one
medium-sized California winery. It's hardly enough to supply a
growing market and the hordes of tourists who descend on the
tasting rooms each weekend, particularly in the fall, when some of
the wineries receive 400 to 500 visitors a day. Not long ago, the
Long Island wineries sold most of their production in their tasting
rooms. Now, with their business growing in many markets, tasting
room depletions are forcing some wineries to charge for what they
once gave away free.
</P>
<P>
   (Several of the region's 21 wineries are actually on Long
Island's South Fork, which was once agricultural but is now given
over principally to the Hamptons.)
</P>
<P>
   If any North Fork endeavor symbolizes how the Long Island wine
industry has progressed in less than three decades, it is the
striking Italianate Raphael winery going up on the Main Road in
this hamlet 10 miles east of Riverhead. It is' a $6 million
testimony to the faith that the owner, John Petrocelli, has in the
Long Island wine industry. A year before its opening, it has
already raised the bar on what is expected from Long Island's
vineyards and fledgling wine producers in the years ahead. No
expense has been spared by Petrocelli, a commercial builder in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Raphael is based on what came before: the
winemaker is Richard Olsen-Harbich, a veteran of 20 years in Long
Island cellars.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael, named for the owner's father, an immigrant and home
winemaker, will be a one-wine winery, and that wine will be merlot.
Of the 60 acres of vines planted, 45 are merlot. Small amounts of
cabernet sauvignon and other Bordeaux varietals are cultivated, but
only to enhance the merlot. There is _ hold on to your seat _ no
chardonnay. In fact, there is no white wine at all, except a
smidgen of sauvignon blanc for friends.
</P>
<P>
   It was in deciding on merlot, and only merlot, that Petrocelli
and Olsen-Harbich drew a figurative line in the sand to mark the
spot where the old Long Island wine industry ends and a new one
begins.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen-Harbich has a foot in both camps. A 20-year veteran of the
Long Island wine industry who was born in Queens and studied
viticulture at Cornell University, he started as founding winemaker
at Bridgehampton Vineyards, worked with the Hargraves for a time
and spent several years as a consultant to newcomers eager to start
up wineries. But the arrival of Petrocelli ratcheted up the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit or miss experimentation, putting vineyards in and pulling
them out _ those days are all behind us,'' Olsen-Harbich said. ``We
know this is merlot country now.''
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound rather like Bordeaux? It does, and with good
reason. Olsen-Harbich, 39, shares his Raphael responsibilities with
Paul Pontallier, the 44-year-old managing director of Chateau
Margaux, one of Bordeaux's legendary premier-cru wine properties.
He has been a consultant to Raphael since 1996, when the project
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our soil, our climate, both are Bordeaux-like,'' Olsen-Harbich
said, ``and our wines taste more like Bordeaux wines than
California wines. We needed the Bordeaux influence. Before we
planted a grape, Paul determined the vineyard layout and the
spacing of the vines. He is here four, occasionally six times a
year, and we talk, sometimes daily, on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Pontallier is circumspect: ``The main problem on the North Fork
is to get the grapes ripe,'' he said by telephone from Bordeaux.
``The region has an interesting combination of warm and cold
temperatures, and the grapes must struggle to get ripe. Often they
are not picked until November. Our merlot here in Bordeaux is three
to four weeks ahead of the merlot on the North Fork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to make great wine overnight,'' he added,
``but we will make very good wine. Of that I am sure.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Raphael, using Pellegrini's cellar, produced 200 cases in 1997
and plans to make about 700 of the 1999 vintage. Eventually, the
goal is around 10,000 cases. Compare that with Pindar Vineyards,
the region's largest, which claims to produce more than 80,000
cases and plans to reach 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even if its production is small, Raphael is a winery on the
grand scale. It will be the goal for new investors to top. Robert
Entenmann, of the baked-goods family, who owns Martha Clara
Vineyards in Mattituck, might be one of the first to do that. He
has plans for a $4-million tasting room and a
$2-million-to-$3-million winery. Leslie Alexander, the owner of the
Houston Rockets basketball team, paid about $1.5 million last year
for acreage in Cutchogue and Mattituck and is said to plan a
winery. Marco Borghese, an Italian with a number of silent
partners, last year bought the Hargrave Vineyard, also in
Cutchogue, for around $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent Long Island wineries sold last year included
Corey Creek, Laurel Lake, Peconic Bay and Bedell Cellars. Bedell
went to Michael Lynne, a Time Warner executive, for about $5
million. Still on the block are two other Cutchogue wineries,
Gristina Vineyards at $5.5 million, and Bidawell Vineyards for $3.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   With most of these sales, the founders plan to stay on making
the wine, while the new owners, mostly businessmen, take over
management, marketing and promotion and enjoy the prestige that
comes with being in the wine business.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many existing wineries are expanding. Bob
Pellegrini, who in 1982 started Pellegrini Vineyards in Cutchogue,
recently bought 60 acres in two parcels ``not to increase
production, but to become totally estate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally estate'' means that he will own all his own vineyards
and can call his wine estate-bottled. Pellegrini Vineyards
currently buys about 40 percent of its grapes, Pellegrini said.
</P>
<P>
   Buying new vineyards is not done casually. Twenty years ago,
prime farmland sold for $4,000 an acre on the North Fork. Today,
driven by competition among wealthy investors, the price can reach
$20,000 to $30,000 an acre, Olsen-Harbich said.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with, say, Pindar, Raphael is very small. But there are
grape growers on the North Fork, many of them weekend farmers,
whose vineyards are even smaller _ far too small to support
wineries. For them, Russell Hearn, Pellegrini's Australian
winemaker, is putting up the region's first custom-crush winery in
Mattituck. Called the Premium Wine Group, it will produce, age,
bottle and label wine for these owners of small vineyards. In
California, similar operations, like the Napa Wine Co., produce
wines for dozens of vineyard owners.
</P>
<P>
   At least one longtime resident, Russell McCall of Cutchogue, has
rejected all the conventional wisdom and has planted a dozen acres
of pinot noir across the road from Pellegrini. Pinot noir is a
temperamental grape with a high rate of failure. But then the
experts said it would never succeed in California, and it has _
impressively. On the North Fork, they welcome a challenge like
that.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers will develop near a wavering front from the
Middle Atlantic coast to southern New England on Wednesday. Strong
high pressure in the central Atlantic Ocean will direct a steady
supply of rich tropical moisture north along the Atlantic seaboard
through Thursday. As a result, downpours with local flooding will
occur especially near the southern New England coast. Farther
inland, abundant clouds and a few showers will occur near the east
slopes of the Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Gradual warming will continue from the interior Southeast to the
Ohio Valley and eastern Great Lakes. Ample sun will raise
temperatures to within a few degrees of seasonal values.
</P>
<P>
   A broken band of thunderstorms will accompany a front from the
western Great Lakes to the central Plains. Meanwhile, most of the
interior West will be sunny and hot. Scattered afternoon thunder
will erupt in the Rockies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DEATH VALLEY HEAT
</P>
<P>
   While unusual summer chill has lingered in parts of the East,
the temperature has surged past the 120 degree mark in Death
Valley, Calif., every day since last Friday. Strong high pressure
centered 20,000 feet above the Southwest is producing the intense
heat. High pressure areas are masses of sinking air that warm
through compression during descent. Death Valley holds the national
high temperature record, 134 degrees, and is the American hot spot
because air is further heated in descending to the valley's
location 194 feet below sea level. &QL;

AMAZON PRESIDENT AND COO QUITS TO JOIN VERTICALNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Stock prices are not up-to-the-minute) 
 By JAMIE PATON   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amazon.com (AMZN:NASDAQ) President and Chief
Operating Officer Joseph Galli has resigned to join the
business-to-business company VerticalNet(VERT:NASDAQ) as president
and chief executive officer, VerticalNet announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Amazon tumbled on the news, down 1 5/8, or 5 percent,
to 37 1/8 in afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
   Galli will succeed Mark Walsh, who has been appointed chairman
of VerticalNet. Michael Hagan, co-founder of VerticalNet, will
continue as chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great companies know when to add power, and as president and
CEO, Joe is capitalizing on VerticalNet's tremendous momentum while
managing our fast-paced growth,'' Walsh said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs analyst Jamie Friedman said Galli's addition
should be seen as bolstering VerticalNet management's strength. He
noted that Hagan, the COO, moved into the background to let others
run the company as it grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the war for talent, this is a huge win,'' Friedman said.
``Joe brings with him the ability to meet the structural challenges
of managing a company with 600 plus employees and multiple lines of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said Goldman will host a meeting on Friday with Walsh
and Galli at New York's Harvard Club. Friedman placed VerticalNet
on Goldman's recommended list last week, the firm's highest rating.
Goldman has not performed underwriting for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, at least, didn't immediately see the switch at the
top of VerticalNet one day before it announced earnings as a
negative. The stock was up 1 13/16, or 3 percent, to 58 9/16 in
afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
   Chatter about the impending resignation first emerged early in
the morning, apparently based on a call that Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette analyst Jamie Kiggen gave to his firm's sales force.
Kiggen was unavailable for comment, but a spokewoman at the firm
did confirm that he ``did go out with a call on that this morning
regarding this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That cushions the blow,'' said Dan Ries, e-commerce analyst at
C.E. Unterberg Towbin, of the move to VerticalNet. It suggests that
Galli had an economic incentive for leaving. It's far worse when an
executive leaves for ``personal reasons'' _ which the Street has
come to recognize as code for when a troubled company gives someone
the boot. Ries rates Amazon a buy. His firm has done no
underwriting for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon is scheduled to report its second-quarter results after
the close on Wednesday, which may have pushed Amazon to announce
the resignation Tuesday. ``We suspect that Galli, knowing that he
would make a move, didn't want to be on the conference call
tomorrow,'' Ries said. ``His absence would have been notable.''
</P>
<P>
   Galli, 42, joined Amazon a little over a year ago from Black &AMP;
Decker (BDK:NYSE), where he was president of the global power tools
and accessories division. Ries noted that Galli received a
significant signing bonus _ $3 million _ with the promise of
another $3 million on his first anniversary with the company, and
$2 million on his second. Galli got his second $3 million check on
June 23. Any stock options that Galli received would be underwater
_ Amazon's stock has been under heavy pressure all year as
investors have questioned the sustainability of its business model
_ and thus worthless.

&HT;     BILL WOULD HIT CRIMINALS WEARING BODY ARMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to
approve legislation that would make it a crime for convicted felons
to possess body armor. The bill also would impose stiffer penalties
on convicts who commit crimes while wearing armor.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would make it easier for the federal government
to donate thousands of pieces of surplus body armor, such as
bullet-proof vests, to state and local governments that can't
afford it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is the
James Guelff Body Armor Act, named after a San Francisco police
officer shot to death in 1994 by a gunman wearing a kevlar vest and
bulletproof helmet.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to approve the bill
Thursday and send it to the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, criminals with violent intentions are more
dangerous when they wear body armor,'' Feinstein said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an
advisory body established by Congress, to increase sentencing
guidelines by as much as five years for convicted defendants who
were wearing body armor while committing a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Tuesday he
supports Feinstein's measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds alright to me,'' Lott said. ``I can't think of many
things I would rather do than make it harder on criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, also pledged
Tuesday to push for the legislation. ``If I can help her, I will,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But time is running out in Congress. Both chambers recess at the
end of this week for the month of August and the political
conventions. When they return in September, Lott has said Congress
will focus first on must-pass spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   A measure similar to Feinstein's Body Armor Act passed the
Senate a year ago as part of the Juvenile Justice bill, but that
measure has been stalled in conference amid squabbling about gun
control provisions.

N. KOREA LEADER AGREES TO VISIT RUSSIA, RUSSIAN OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Originally slugged RUSSIA-DEFENSE on NYT-BUDGET and
NYT-WORLD-BUDGET.)  
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, is planning to
visit Russia in September, Russian officials said Tuesday, a
further step by the once-secretive North Korean state to overcome
its isolation.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is planned for Vladivostok, a port city in Russia's
Far East. Arrangements for the visit were confirmed Tuesday by
aides to Yevgeny Nazdratenko, the governor of Russia's Primorye
region, which borders North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is being billed as an ``unofficial'' visit to the
Primorye region, not a negotiating session with Kremlin leaders.
But the agenda includes trade, economic cooperation and other
measures to expand ties between Russia and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Long one of the most insular of nations, North Korea has begun
to break down the barriers that have separated it from the world.
Last month, Kim was host of a summit meeting in Pyongyang, the
North Korean capital, with his South Korean counterpart, Kim
Dae-jung. North Korea has also established diplomatic relations in
recent months with Italy, the Philippines and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, recently visited
Pyongyang. After meeting with Kim, Putin reported that North Korea
had offered to abandon its missile program if other nations would
help it launch satellites into space.
</P>
<P>
   While there was considerable ambiguity at first about the North
Korean proposal, Russian officials later said that North Korea was
not asking Western nations to provide it with rocket boosters and
would be content with an arrangement in which two or three of its
satellites were launched each year in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a matter of launching from North Korean territory,
but from the territory of other countries,'` Russia's foreign
minister, Igor Ivanov, said during the recent meeting of eight
industrial nations in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have highlighted the North Korean offer in order to
challenge the prime rationale for the American missile defense plan
and to debunk the notion that North Korea is a ``rogue state'` _ a
dangerously irrational nation. Clinton administration officials
acknowledge that the North Korean offer is potentially significant,
though it needs to be explored further in talks between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Kim's travel. It is a matter of public
record that he has visited China. But Kim has also said he has gone
to Indonesia and other nations, sometimes incognito.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation to visit Vladivostok was made by Nazdratenko, who
accompanied Putin on his recent trip to Pyonyang, Natalya V.
Vstovskaya, a spokeswoman for Nazdratenko said in a telephone
interview Tuesday. She said that Kim has accepted the invitation
and that the trip is scheduled for the first few days of September.
The North Korean consulate here declined to comment on the
potential visit.
</P>
<P>
   Vstovskaya said that Nazdratenko proposed several agricultural
projects to Kim during the Russians' visit to Pyongyang and hoped
to encourage new business, including the use of Russian railroads
for trade with North Korea. ``We want our railroads and ports to
work at full capacity so that North Korea's cargo is not going via
China but through our territory,'` she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has already granted permission for 5,000
North Koreans to work in the timber and construction industries in
Primorye, though the current number of workers is currently far
less.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to Russian press reports, Nazdratenko, an autocratic
governor who has ridden roughshod over the region's press and
political establishment, established a rapport with the North
Korean leader. The 52-year-old Nazdratenko and the 58-year-old Kim
have the same birthday _ February 16. Nazdratenko, who rarely
drinks, later said that he was forced to drink several toasts to
placate Kim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to drink for the sake of peace at the border,'` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nazdratenko later called for expanded ties with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of brainless politics, we literally abandoned this
country, and we not only froze relations with it for 10 years, but
nearly created an enemy on our borders,'' the Russian newspaper
Konkurent quoted Nazdratenko as saying. ``I am glad that there has
been a breakthrough in relations with North Korea and that Putin
did it.''

 &HT;    Paper bag clad artisan breads a new and alluring choice
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Artisan breads _ made by hand, cherished for
their taste, texture and crust _ have gone mainstream in the Miami
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago everyone bought commercial bread at the
supermarket, mindlessly picking up plastic bags of soft bread. Now
the daily bread may come in paper bags designed to preserve the
cherished crust.
</P>
<P>
   The number of artisan bakeries is growing, and in supermarkets
such as Dorothy Lane Market, which bakes bread in a $54,000 French
oven, hand-crafted breads outsell commercial varieties and account
for 54 perent of total bread sales. More French baguettes are sold
in the two DLM stores than the most popular commercial bread.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who seek out these new bakeries willingly pay from
$2.45 to $4.99 a loaf, considerably more than the cost of national
commercial breads, priced anywhere from $1.19 to $2.69, with house
brands even lower.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent opening of Panera Bread, a St. Louis-based
chain, at Town &AMP; Country Shopping Center in Kettering, the
competition has heated up. To assess the quality of the offerings,
we assembled a panel of tasters and purchased four popular kinds of
artisan breads: sourdough, asiago cheese (a new contender),
multigrain and raisin bread. Dorothy Lane Market, Panera, Big Sky
and Village Bread (formerly Great Harvest) were included.
</P>
<P>
   When the battle of the 13 breads was over, panelists were asked
which single loaf bread they would want to take home. The unanimous
winner was the asiago cheese bread from Dorothy Lane Market. It
trounced the asiago contender from Panera, which is credited with
originating this specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Lane Market also came out on top in the four-way
competition of sourdough breads.
</P>
<P>
   Judging of both the multigrain and raisin bread categories was
made difficult by the disparate offerings. The multigrain loaves
ranged from very soft to a dense, in-your-face bread that announced
its healthful intentions. The raisin breads also were varied. Not
all include nuts, and the textures range from fluffy to dense.
</P>
<P>
   We bought all the breads and sampled them the same day; because
some breads are available on rotating schedules, we were unable to
buy comparable samples in each category from every store.
</P>
<P>
   The tasters included a chef, caterer, home baker and two Dayton
Daily News editors, as well as the food editor. The bread was
evaluated on appearance, aroma, taste and texture. Ratings were
done on a 10-point scale, with 10 the highest. Anything under 3 was
rated ``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sourdough breads vary in style and shape from store to store.
</P>
<P>
   All six tasters gave their top marks to the Dorothy Lane Market
sourdough, saying the ``well-blistered'' appearance ``holds the
promise of a hearty, chewy, crusty bread.'' Most found it delivered
the distinctive sourdough flavor and aroma. The bread also had a
desirable open-textured crumb.
</P>
<P>
   Panera won most of its points on its good looks. Despite a
``chewy'' crust, the fine-crumbed inside was termed ``too soft.''
Judges also faulted the bread for bland taste and lack of the
distinctive sourdough aroma. The tasters found the Village Bread
sourdough generally acceptable, with a distinctive sourdough taste
but complained that the texture was too doughy. The Big Sky Wyoming
sourdough failed on all points.SOURDOUGH BREAD

<P>
   Store price Rating
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Lane Market $3.89 8
</P>
<P>
   Panera $2.45 6.1
</P>
<P>
   Village $3.00 5.6
</P>
<P>
   Big Sky $3.25 3  &QR;  While Panera may be as known for its asiago
cheese bread as its sourdough, Dorothy Lane Market introduced its
version before the Kettering Panera store opened. Village Bread
also added an asiago cheese bread.
</P>
<P>
   The Dorothy Lane Market version _ the best of this show _ won a
near-perfect score from one taster who noted the cheese is studded
throughout, providing an intense aroma and ``wonderfully cheesy''
taste.
</P>
<P>
   Again Panera won all its points on looks, with all the cheese
baked into a split top. But there was little cheese aroma or taste
beyond the topping. ``A great top crust just isn't enough,'' wrote
one taster.
</P>
<P>
   The Village asiago bread turned out to be flavored with pesto
and tasters found that overwhelmed the cheese. The texture was
judged substantial, with a chewy crust
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Store Price Rating
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Lane Market $4.79 8
</P>
<P>
   Village $4.25 5.6
</P>
<P>
   Panera $3.75 5  &QR;  Raisin breads vary considerably at specialty
bread stores. Some, such as Panera, use just raisins and cinnamon.
Because this company doesn't use nuts, the most expensive
ingredient, the loaf is markedly cheaper. Village uses both raisins
and walnuts. Dorothy Lane Market's dense loaf uses an abundance of
dark and golden raisins plus nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Panera's raisin bread, which nudged out the deceptively plain
loaf from Village Bread, would be a good candidate for toast or
French toast, tasters thought. They liked the sweet, simple
cinnamon aroma but generally found the bread too soft. Tasters
detected a molasses smell in the Village raisin bread. Some
complained of a bitter aftertaste, but others said the
plain-looking loaf tasted ``much better than expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dorothy Lane loaf was visibly badly burned, with scorched
raisins, which earned it an unacceptable rating. However several
thought the dense loaf, with its high ratio of raisins and nuts
``could have been good if not burnt.''
</P>
<P>
   RAISIN BREAD
</P>
<P>
   Store Price Rating
</P>
<P>
   Panera $3.10 6
</P>
<P>
   Village $4.50 5.6
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Lane Market $4.99 2.6  &QR;  The only bread to earn a perfect
10 from one taster was the multigrain bread from Big Sky, but
another taster found the soft loaf unacceptable. That was typical
of the scoring in this category, indicating wildly different
expectations for multigrain breads. One taster found the Dorothy
Lane Market crust ``hard and dry;'' others thought it overbaked,
but another thought it had a ``great chewy crust.'' The Panera
loaf, scattered with oats for eye appeal, was found unacceptable by
two tasters who complained about the texture and aroma. Considering
that a rating of 5 is considered just acceptable, none of the
candidates scored high marks.
</P>
<P>

   George W. Bush introduced his running mate, Dick Cheney, to a
cheering crowd of supporters in Austin, Texas, Tuesday, calling the
former defense secretary a ``valuable partner'' who will help lead
Republicans to the White House. A week before GOP delegates
formally nominate the Bush-Cheney ticket, Bush turned to the man
who headed his three-month search process - bypassing several
prominent Republicans who had vied for the job. ``I was impressed
by his thoughtfulness and the way he approached his mission and,
gradually, I realized the person who was best qualified to be my
vice president was working by my side,'' said Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME
</P>
<P>
   Once Dick Cheney accepted the second spot, George W. Bush made
calls to the also-rans, thanking them for their participation.
Among those contacted: Sens. Bill Frist and Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, John McCain of Arizona and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska;
Govs. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, Frank Keating of Oklahoma, George
Pataki of New York, Christie Whitman of New Jersey; former Govs.
John Danforth of Missouri and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee; and
Rep. John Kasich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   GORE ON DECK NOW
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore said he's narrowed his running-mate search to a short
list of possible choices and is determined to keep the final
considerations ``very private and dignified.'' Gore met today in
Washington with former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who
has been conducting the Democratic running mate search _ Dick
Cheney's counterpart. ``We're getting close to what you would call
a short list, but we have some work to do,'' said Gore, posing for
photos with Christopher. ``Only one person is going to be picked
and the others are not going to be. I waEN THERE'S THE ABORTION
ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights activists in the Republican Party reacted with
dismay to the choice of abortion foe Dick Cheney as George W.
Bush's running mate.``I think it sends a clear message ... that
there is not going to be the real option of getting the attention
of Governor Bush in terms of reproductive rights for women,''said
Roselyn O'Connell, head of the National Women's Political Caucus
and a Republican. Said Ann Stone, chair of Republicans for Choice,
claiming most party members favor some sort of abortion rights: ``I
think Bush has successfully united half the party, maybe only 30
percent of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   TEAMSTERS CHIEF DRIVING OFF WITH GOP
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters President James P. Hoffa will attend the Republican
convention as the guest of honor at a reception hosted by GOP
Chairman Jim Nicholson, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge and 10
Republican members of Congress. ``This should not be construed as a
message to any presidential candidate,'' said Teamsters spokesman
Brett Caldweg, next Monday. Her subject? ``I'm going to talk about
George, of course,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ROLE FOR TELEGENIC HISPANIC NEPHEW
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's telegenic nephew George P. will have a featured
role at the Republican convention, and brother Jeb, the governor of
Florida, will be doing the rounds of TV interview shows. But Dad
and Mom, the former president and first lady, will be more in the
background. ``We want to be careful it doesn't turn into a Bush
family reunion,'' said convention co-chairman Andrew Card. George
P. Bush, 24, the son of Jeb and his Mexican-born wife, Columba, has
been on a nationwide tour promoting his uncle's candidacy and is
seen as a valuable campaigner in pursuit of Hispanic and youth
votes.
</P>
<P>
   UNDERLYING PROS AND CONS
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll out just before George W. Bush
selected Dick Cheney as his running mate, suggested that Bush
retains advantages on several key personal qualities like
leadership and trust. But there's good news for Al Gore as well. A
majority of voters saw Bush as unlikely to keep the budget balanced
while cutting income taxes, and more thought Gore had a better
knowledge of world affairs and a better handle on the key issue of
health care.
</P>
<P>
   THE CRADLE OF LIBERTY
</P>
<P>
   Americans who watch the Republican convention next week will see
a slew of patriotic symbols, from the Liberty Bell to Independence
Hall _ where both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S.
Constitution were created. Such rich imagery gives the Grand Old
Party an opportunity to project its patriotic underpinnings to a
nation of voters that experts say are looking for moral authority.
``Philadelphia says `America' to people,'' said Meryl Levitz, who
promotes tourism for the greater Philadelphia area and has worked
closely with convention planners. ``In many ways, it's the most
American city.''
</P>
<P>
   PARTY-CRASHING SPIN MACHINE
</P>
<P>
   It may be a Republican party, but Democrats are promising to
crash. Al Gore will be vacationing when George W. Bush and his
fellow Republicans gather next week, but a band of Democrats will
infiltrate the GOP show, trying to inject their message and steal a
piece of the limelight. They'll begin by putting a dozen or so
Texans on a bus to wax about Bush's failings as governor as they
travel through battleground states on route to Philadelphia. The
disaffected Texans will fly home, but Democratic operatives will
stay on, offering daily spin to many of the 15,000 journalists at
work.
</P>
<P>
   LET'S PLAY PEPPER SPRAY BALL
</P>
<P>
   Police dealing with protesters at the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles may be armed with paintball guns that
shoot balls filled with pepper spray. Police said the balls, as big
around as a nickel, would be used only against protesters who are
violent or destroying property. Instead of paint, the police would
use the pepper spray. Balls fired from a standard paintgun travel
about 240 feet a second, leaving a welt when they strike someone's
skin.
</P>
<P>
   TEAMING UP AGAINST THE HEAVYWEIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Bob Franks of New Jersey and Rick Lazio of New York, two
little-known four-term suburban Republican congressmen, are the
Davids facing the Goliaths as they seek open Senate seats in
neighboring states. One is running against the biggest Senate
campaign spender in history (Jon Corzine). The other is challenging
the most famous woman in American politics (Hillary Clinton).
Franks and Lazio are taking the unusual step today of holding a
joint fund-raiser in the wealthy Monmouth County, N.J., community
of Rumson, hoping to collect $50,000 each from some well-heeled
Republicans to buy expensive TV advertising this fall.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING RID OF TV AUDIENCE REPELLENT
</P>
<P>
   Reinventing or in some cases abandoning the rituals of party
gatherings past, the Republican convention will more than ever
amount to a lavish multimedia spectacle that pushes controversy to
the sidelines in favor of an unabashed celebration of the goals and
vision of George W. Bush. Missing will be angry debates over issues
and the usual parade of elected officials introducing other elected
officials. But it will still be the oratorical roles of the likes
of Republican stars like Colin Powell and John McCain that are
likely to dominate the window of network news coverage that on most
nights will open at about 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE'D ALL THOSE NAMES COME FROM?
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, the front-runner for the Reform Party presidential
nomination, is suddenly under fire for alleged voter fraud from his
little-known rival in a dispute that escalates the tensions with
the forces loyal to party founderRoss Perot. At a press
conference, John Hagelin, who is competing for the nomination in
the party's national mail-in primary, accused the Buchanan campaign
of election fraud by padding lists of ballot recipients with at
least 250,000 names of Republicans. ``This time Pat's gone too
far,'' said Hagelin.

 &HT;    CHENEY CHOICE OPENS CENTER FOR GORE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Vice President Al Gore narrows his list of
potential running mates, experts said the choice would likely to be
tailored to help him stake out the political center.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the day Gov. George W. Bush of Texas solidified a
conservative Republican ticket by announcing his choice of Dick
Cheney, a former defense secretary and Wyoming congressman, Gore
met with Warren Christopher, who heads his search for a running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting close to what you would call a short list, but
we have some work to do,'' Gore told reporters before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   While political experts suggested that Bush's selection was a
solid choice for the GOP, it also gives Gore a chance to sharpen
his appeal to the moderate swing voters that occupy the center of
the ideological spectrum, often in pivotal states.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats assailed Cheney's voting record. ``He is far from the
mainstream,'' Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said at a Capitol Hill
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're likely to see the Gore camp say that the selection of
Cheney shows who Bush really is _ a conservative rather than a
compassionate conservative,'' said Joel Goldstein, a Saint(cq)
Louis University political science professor and author of the
book, ``The Modern American Vice Presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Cheney is presidential, and Gore has to choose someone who
is at least as presidential as Bush's choice,'' added Goldstein.
``Otherwise, there will be a political payoff for Bush if Americans
perceive that Gore chose badly.''
</P>
<P>
   According to experts, Gore has five main options in making his
selection:
</P>
<P>
   _ If he wants to shore up his political base, he would need a
party stalwart like Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts or House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri. But Kerry is from a
state Gore is likely to carry anyway, and his voting record in the
Senate is left of center. Gephardt insists he is focused on
restoring a Democratic majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   _ If Gore wants to carry one of the key states in the election,
he would need someone like Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, with 25
electoral votes, or Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, with 22
electoral votes. Graham has experience as a governor and senator,
but Florida is always a tough state for Democrats. And Durbin is
relatively unknown outside his home state.
</P>
<P>
   _ If he wants to match Bush's choice of Cheney, an experienced
Washington player, he could turn to former Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell of Maine. Maine has only four electoral votes, but
Mitchell earned a national reputation in the Senate and has become
an international figure by negotiating peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   _ If he wants a flashy new face in politics, he would find one
in Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana or Sen. John Edwards of North
Carolina. But both are from solidly Republican states, and both are
baby-faced, a likely handicap in a televised debate with the
statesmanlike Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   _ If he wants drama, he can choose former Sen. William Cohen of
Maine, a moderate Republican who crossed party lines to serve as
defense secretary in the Clinton administration. The selection of
Cohen would send a message that Gore wants to restore
bipartisanship in Washington. But a Republican on the Democratic
ticket could be discouraging to partisan Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Elections are not decided by the choice of running mates. In
1988, for example, Bush's father, Vice President George Bush, chose
the unpresidential Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana and still won by a
landslide over Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts and his
presidential running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But in close elections, as this fall's contest between Gore and
Bush is expected to be, the choice of a running mate can be
important, not only in terms of winning key states but also in the
message the candidates hope to send to the voters who are only now
beginning to focus on the race.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Tuesday that he would keep his selection process
``private and dignified ... out of respect for the men and women
who are under consideration.'' He said he would likely make his
choice known several days before the Democratic National Convention
begins in Los Angeles on Aug. 14.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even before his stunning victory in the British
Open, Tiger Woods was a golfing phenomenon. Now he has become much
more, the single most influential figure in world sports, an icon
to millions, the new Muhammad Ali, the new Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   And, pretty soon, the $759,150 purse he took away from St.
Andrews is going to look like a drop in the ocean compared with the
billions of dollars he is likely to generate for himself, for golf,
and for the economy of the world's golf-playing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Already Monday, media commentators on both sides of the Atlantic
were speculating that Woods could become the world's first
billion-dollar sponsorship franchisee.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear exactly how much money he will end up being
offered, and even less clear how much he will end up taking, given
his reputation for modesty and pure professional dedication to the
craft of golf, but it is clear that, what he doesn't earn for
himself, others will revel in earning through him.
</P>
<P>
   Across the U.S., a golf-course building mania has set in, and
it's all due to Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   He's done the impossible, making golf cool to young people, and
broken down the sport's crusty image as a pursuit for pampered
middle-aged white men with expanding waistlines.
</P>
<P>
   After the victory in last month's U.S. Open, the president of
the NBC television network, Dick Ebersol, said Woods had completed
what he called ``the last step in a 3 1/2-year process to join Ali
and Jordan as the only athletes in the TV generation to be larger
than life.''
</P>
<P>
   The British victory, making Woods the youngest holder of all
four major golf championships as well as the breaker of several
course and world golfing records, has only spread the mythology.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics speak for themselves: the only golfer to avoid a
bunker in 72 holes at St. Andrews; the lowest shot-count, 19 under
par, in major golf competition history; the ability to make rivals
look like floundering amateurs while showing signs of constant
improvement in his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger has no opposition, only a field,'' wrote George Vecsey
in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali had Frazier. Navratilova had Evert. DiMaggio had Williams
and Musial. McGwire has Sosa. Tiger has only himself and his caddie
and his touch and his inner light, but that is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Woods first turned professional, many industry
observers thought Nike was insane to offer him a $40 million
sponsorship deal over five years. Golf accounted for only 2 percent
of the company's sales, and Woods was far from a surefire
phenomenon then.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nike is selling golf balls, golf shirts, clubs and carrying
bags as though they were the last chocolate cookies on earth.
Already, an advertisement he did for Nike bouncing a golf ball on a
wedge with awe-inspiring control has become legendary.
</P>
<P>
   He has managed to sign a second official endorsement deal with
Nike's golf equipment rivals Titleist and he has deals with
American Express, Rolex, Wheaties cereal and Electronic Arts, which
makes a golfing video game with the Tiger image.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' career income from tournaments _ $20 million, including
$5 million this year so far _ is starting to look paltry. Before
his double coup, his father Earl estimated he could be earning $1.5
million per weekend for sponsored appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has shown repeatedly that money is not his top priority.
He refused to take part in U.S. television advertisements out of
solidarity with an actors' strike. And he devotes much of his free
time to the Tiger Woods Foundation, touring at his own expense to
hold golf clinics for young, often disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he likes it or not, he is likely to become a
mini-industry. At the peak of Michael Jordan's career, he was
estimated to be worth $1 billion to the city of Chicago, home of
his team the Bulls, and around $10 billion to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   With decades of golf-playing ahead, Tiger Woods could be putting
that achievement deep into the shade. &QL;

middle-aged white men with expanding waistlines.
</P>
<P>
   After the victory in last month's U.S. Open, the president of
the NBC television network, Dick Ebersol, said Woods had completed
what he called ``the last step in a 3 1/2-year process to join Ali
and Jordan as the only athletes in the TV generation to be larger
than life.''
</P>
<P>
   The British victory, making Woods the youngest holder of all
four major golf championships as well as the breaker of several
course and world golfing records, has only spread the mythology.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics speak for themselves: the only golfer to avoid a
bunker in 72 holes at St. Andrews; the lowest shot-count, 19 under
par, in major golf competition history; the ability to make rivals
look like floundering amateurs while showing signs of constant
improvement in his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger has no opposition, only a field,'' wrote George Vecsey
in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali had Frazier. Navratilova had Evert. DiMaggio had Williams
and Musial. McGwire has Sosa. Tiger has only himself and his caddie
and his touch and his inner light, but that is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Woods first turned professional, many industry
observers thought Nike was insane to offer him a $40 million
sponsorship deal over five years. Golf accounted for only 2 percent
of the company's sales, and Woods was far from a surefire
phenomenon then.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nike is selling golf balls, golf shirts, clubs and carrying
bags as though they were the last chocolate cookies on earth.
Already, an advertisement he did for Nike bouncing a golf ball on a
wedge with awe-inspiring control has become legendary.
</P>
<P>
   He has managed to sign a second official endorsement deal with
Nike's golf equipment rivals Titleist and he has deals with
American Express, Rolex, Wheaties cereal and Electronic Arts, which
makes a golfing video game with the Tiger image.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' career income from tournaments _ $20 million, including
$5 million this year so far _ is starting to look paltry. Before
his double coup, his father Earl estimated he could be earning $1.5
million per weekend for sponsored appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has shown repeatedly that money is not his top priority.
He refused to take part in U.S. television advertisements out of
solidarity with an actors' strike. And he devotes much of his free
time to the Tiger Woods Foundation, touring at his own expense to
hold golf clinics for young, often disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he likes it or not, he is likely to become a
mini-industry. At the peak of Michael Jordan's career, he was
estimated to be worth $1 billion to the city of Chicago, home of
his team the Bulls, and around $10 billion to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   With decades of golf-playing ahead, Tiger Woods could be putting
that achievement deep into the shade. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Even before his stunning victory in the British
Open, Tiger Woods was a golfing phenomenon. Now he has become much
more, the single most influential figure in world sports, an icon
to millions, the new Muhammad Ali, the new Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   And, pretty soon, the $759,150 purse he took away from St.
Andrews is going to look like a drop in the ocean compared with the
billions of dollars he is likely to generate for himself, for golf,
and for the economy of the world's golf-playing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Already Monday, media commentators on both sides of the Atlantic
were speculating that Woods could become the world's first
billion-dollar sponsorship franchisee.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear exactly how much money he will end up being
offered, and even less clear how much he will end up taking, given
his reputation for modesty and pure professional dedication to the
craft of golf, but it is clear that, what he doesn't earn for
himself, others will revel in earning through him.
</P>
<P>
   Across the U.S., a golf-course building mania has set in, and
it's all due to Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   He's done the impossible, making golf cool to young people, and
broken down the sport's crusty image as a pursuit for pampered
middle-aged white men with expanding waistlines.
</P>

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ So who is surprised? Who on earth _ barring CNN and
an increasingly desperate U.S. President Bill Clinton _ really
thought they could turn the pumpkin of the Oslo agreement into a
golden carriage of peace?
</P>
<P>
   What folly prompted Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat to accept
that agreement seven years ago, a treaty without guarantees, which
promised no statehood, no end to Jewish settlements, no return of
Palestinian refugees and _ most important of all _ no capital in
Jerusalem?
</P>
<P>
   The carriage may have looked good on the White House lawn in
1993, with its ``historic'' handshake between Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and Clinton quoting the Koran. But it
had no wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, it was all about trust _ technicolor trust _
the ``peace of the brave,'' the euphoria of two old enemies, the
sons of Abraham making friends. But everything they should have
been talking about _ Jerusalem, settlers, refugees, statehood _ was
postponed for three years.
</P>
<P>
   And such was the nature of this lopsided, hopelessly unfair
agreement, that the deadlines slipped away and only now, after
another three years' delay have the antagonists confronted reality:
Oslo doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at what it originally said. The Oslo Declaration of
Principles, Article One (``Aim of Negotiations'') said quite
specifically that ``it is understood that...final status
negotiations will lead to the implementation of Security Council
Resolutions 242 and 338.''
</P>
<P>
   These 1967 and 1973 resolutions called for the withdrawal of
Israeli forces from Arab territories seized in the 1967 war and the
security of all states (including Israel) in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But Oslo allowed the Israelis to renegotiate Resolution 242, to
decide which bits of occupied territory it would give back _ the
garbage tip of Gaza, for example _ and which parts it would keep:
Jerusalem and most of the settlements.
</P>
<P>
   And by Tuesday Clinton, in his statement of defeat, was reduced
to changing the very terms of Oslo, announcing only that the
negotiations were ``based'' on 242 and 338 _ which was not what
Oslo stipulated at all.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the ``implementation'' promised in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat must have realized that the end had come when U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made her preposterous offer _
immortalized in a report in Tuesday's New York Times _ of ``a sense
of sovereignty'' over the Muslim religious sites of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   So much for statehood. So much for an Israeli withdrawal from
occupied East Jerusalem. So much for a halt to settlement building.
</P>
<P>
   Even the silly villages which Arafat might have controlled
outside his would-be capital would have ``virtually (sic) full
sovereignty,'' according to the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak Rabin died for his peace treaty with the Palestinians
but Arafat is not the stuff of which martyrs are made. He knows
what happened to Irish revolutionary Michael Collins after another
hopelessly one-sided ``peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet what can Arafat tell his people now? Seven years ago, I
drove the bypass roads that Israel was building to prevent
Palestinians reaching Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat's Road to Ruin'' was the paper's headline to my story.
Israel's friends exploded in rage. What cynicism. What bias. Did we
not realize that Oslo represented the best chance for peace in a
hundred years?
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the story of that winding road was all too accurate. It
ran out, Tuesday, at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak wouldn't give up Jerusalem. He
wouldn't abandon the settlements. Arafat would not make the
``concession'' _ for which read capitulation _ of ceding Israeli
control over all of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   So the sons of Abraham acknowledged what so many Israelis and
Palestinians knew all along: that Oslo didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton predictably saw fit to praise the stronger of the two
parties _ he spoke of Barak's ``courage,'' vision,'' etc. _ but
merely referred to Arafat's ``commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for America's role as the ``honest broker'' of the
Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   Offered virtual sovereignty to secure virtual peace, the
Palestinian leadership _ corrupt and effete and undemocratic _
preferred failure to humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are supposed to talk it all through again by
mid-September. And Clinton says they must avoid ``unilateral
action'' _ he meant a declaration of statehood by Arafat, something
the Israelis have threatened to oppose with annexation.
</P>
<P>
   Have no doubt, it may be all Arafat has left to offer
Palestinians. Virtual statehood, that is. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ After three days of fevered speculation, the
Republican Party's presidential ticket was finalized Tuesday when
the nominee, George W. Bush, confirmed that he had chosen Richard
Cheney, former congressman, former White House chief of staff and
former defense secretary, to be his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush broke the news to Cheney in a dawn telephone call to his
home in Dallas; he later announced his choice to reporters in
Austin and planned a joint rally at the University of Texas in the
afternoon.

<P>
   Cheney, his columnist wife, Lynne, and their daughter,
Elizabeth, flew to Austin for lunch with the Bushes at the Texas
Governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   At the weekend, Cheney, 59, is expected to accompany Bush on a
five-day progress through Middle America that will culminate in
their arrival, together, in Philadelphia for the final day of the
Republican Convention in Philadelphia next week.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Republicans, including disappointed contenders for the
vice presidential slot, at once rallied around Cheney, describing
him as an excellent choice and an ideal complement to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, who was defeated by Bush in a bitter
primary campaign but still enjoys wide support in the country at
large and in sections of the Republican Party, said that Cheney
would be ``an outstanding vice president...and one that will garner
significant support throughout the party and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's name was briefly back in the frame last week after a
signature-gathering campaign among Republican congressmen last week
lobbying for his inclusion on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush-McCain ticket was seen by many, not only Republicans, as
offering Bush an almost failsafe route to the White House. But
McCain had said he would not accept the number two slot, even if it
were offered.
</P>
<P>
   Some eyebrows were none the less raised at the fact that Bush
had selected the very person he had entrusted with the task of
finding him a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a trusted friend of the Bush family, was chairman of the
search committee and in charge of soliciting information _
including extensive dossiers with personal financial and other
information _ from the short-listed candidates.
</P>
<P>
   He will now know a great deal about individuals who might find
themselves nominated for cabinet posts in the event of a Bush
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that Bush was on the verge of settling for Cheney were
given substance late last Friday when it emerged that he had made a
brief trip to Wyoming, where he keeps a farm, to register as a
voter there.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Constitution discourages a presidential ticket where
both candidates come from the same state. If Cheney had not changed
his registration, Bush could be deprived of all the electoral
college votes from Texas _ votes that could be crucial if the
election is as close as is currently predicted.
</P>
<P>
   It further emerged that Cheney, who has suffered three heart
attacks in the past and underwent a quadruple bypass operation 12
years ago, had spent a day at a Washington hospital late last week
for medical checks to confirm his physical fitness.
</P>
<P>
   In the camp of Bush's Democratic rival for the White House, Vice
President Al Gore, the mood was quietly upbeat. Bush's decision to
plump for a politically ``safe'' Washington insider, and a white
male to boot, was described as ``timid.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also seen as leaving Gore's options wide open. Had Bush
selected a woman or ethnic minority candidate, or someone much
younger than himself, the pressure might have been on Gore to match
that choice.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the selection of Cheney preempt that pressure, it
offers the Gore campaign several new lines of attack. By Tuesday,
Cheney's health record was already the butt of talk-show jokes.
</P>
<P>
   His last-minute change of voter registration exposes him to
accusations of dubious sleight of hand, as Cheney's primary
residence now is clearly Texas, even though he represented Wyoming
for 11 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Cheney's position as defense secretary in the
administration of George Bush, Sr. enables the Gore team to present
George W. Bush as a creature of his father or, as Democratic
campaigners were dubbing him Tuesday, a ``retro-candidate.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ After three days of fevered speculation, the
Republican Party's presidential ticket was finalized Tuesday when
the nominee, George W. Bush, confirmed that he had chosen Richard
Cheney, former congressman, former White House chief of staff and
former defense secretary, to be his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush broke the news to Cheney in a dawn telephone call to his
home in Dallas; he later announced his choice to reporters in
Austin and planned a joint rally at the University of Texas in the
afternoon.

A CHILL IN THE AIR FOR FREE-RANGE CHICKENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (subs throughout to change `Gionnone' to `Giannone') 
 By ROZANNE GOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imported free-range chickens processed by a new method are
winning converts among New York chefs and could be in supermarkets
by September.
</P>
<P>
   Giannone Poultry, in St. Cuthbert, northeast of Montreal, has
devised a technique for chilling its freshly slaughtered chickens
with frigid air instead of water, said Tony Giannone, the sales
director. As a result, he said, the birds are less likely to breed
bacteria and also absorb no liquid; the taste and texture both
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Giannone chickens are ``the closest in flavor and juiciness to
the famous poulet de Bresse of France,'' said David Cunningham, the
chef at the Lenox Room, on the Upper East Side. Cunningham, who has
cooked in France, was among the first to showcase the Canadian
chickens on his menu.
</P>
<P>
   The birds are big and meaty, with great chicken taste. They are
raised on corn, soy and wheat and receive no antibiotics or growth
hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials studied chicken processing in Europe before
developing the new method, which uses air to evenly chill
eviscerated chickens as they travel through a cooling room for
exactly 64 minutes, reaching a temperature of 34 degrees. The
technique was designed to meet the strict sanitary rules of the
Canadian and United States agriculture departments. It eliminates
the usual final step of spraying the birds with water to keep them
from drying out.
</P>
<P>
   The chickens are immediately packaged using a new process that
gives them a 10-to-14-day shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   Giannone chickens are served at Bouterin, the Brasserie, Monkey
Bar, Clementine, Tabla, Della Femina and the Water Club as well as
the Ryland Inn in Whitehouse, N.J. At retail, whole Giannone
chickens are $1.95 a pound from D'Artagnan, (800) 327-8246.

 &HT;    FOES SAY AOL-TIME WARNER COULD BECOME AN INTERNET TYRANT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Federal Communications Commission reviews
the proposed combination of America Online Inc. and Time Warner
Inc. on Thursday, it will get an earful of boos from merger
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nation's biggest companies, including Walt Disney
Co. and General Electric Co.'s NBC, are asking regulators to limit
the power of a merged AOL Time Warner to prevent creation an
Internet bully.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has been especially aggressive on Capitol Hill, darkly
warning lawmakers and regulators that AOL Time Warner could choke
off competition in ``interactive TV'' _ the place where the
Internet and old-fashioned media are coming together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger will allow AOL to leverage its dominant position in
online Internet services with Time Warner's local cable monopolies
to control the emergent interactive television market,'' Disney
said in an FCC filing submitted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks are just ``more misinformation from our
competitors,'' responded AOL spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan. Disney
executives ``seem more interested in spinning fantasy than in
talking facts,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney is not alone in its complaints. In the seven months
since AOL, the No. 1 Internet service provider, and Time Warner,
one of the world's largest entertainment and news companies,
announced their proposed merger, critics have been growing louder.
</P>
<P>
   Though shareholders of both companies have overwhelmingly
approved the merger, worth roughly $117 billion, the companies
still need the approval of the FCC, as well as the Federal Trade
Commission and the European Union. Each is expected to rule this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Time Warner executives say they are confident of
approval because their companies operate in different markets, and
therefore don't compete. AOL has 23 million online subscribers.
Time Warner owns cable TV operations and media companies that churn
out news and entertainment, such as CNN and Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   But merger opponents say that very combination of content, cable
and online access will lead to a new kind of monopoly. For example,
critics suggest AOL Time Warner might provide quick online
connections to its own content, but slower access to competitors'
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the potential for bullying, Disney points to its
own problems with Time Warner last spring, when the two companies
got into a contract dispute. Time Warner responded to the
disagreement by blacking out Disney's ABC network on the cable
systems it owned.
</P>
<P>
   Then this summer, Disney was rebuffed by Time Warner when it
proposed that the companies try working together to distribute
content.
</P>
<P>
   Now Disney lobbyists are showing a 10-minute video to lawmakers,
spelling out the case against AOL Time Warner in stark, scary
terms. The company is asking the FCC to effectively break up AOL
Time Warner by separating its cable distribution system from the
content-providing operations.
</P>
<P>
   NBC also has filed with the FCC, saying AOL Time Warner should
be forced to provide its online and video competitors with
non-discriminatory access to Time Warner cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's hearing, FCC members will hear testimony from
Disney, as well as other merger critics, such as BellSouth Corp.
and the Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   While media companies are fretting about interactive television,
online companies are complaining about what they call AOL's
``monopolistic'' practices involving its popular instant messaging
system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a group of 16 companies released a policy paper
condemning AOL, saying it has put a virtual stranglehold on instant
communicate freely on the Internet,'' said Margaret Heffernan, CEO
of iCast Corp., one of the 16 instant messaging rivals. ``AOL is
robbing IM users of this right.''

   In Europe, regulators primarily are concerned about the online
delivery of entertainment. That's because AOL has a four-year
agreement with Bertelsmann AG, Germany's largest media company,
guaranteeing that company will have access to AOL as a marketplace
for its music, television and publishing content.
</P>
<P>
   By combining with Time Warner, AOL also will gain ''preferential
access to the leading source of music publishing rights and music
repertoire'' in much of Europe, the European ine companies are
complaining about what they call AOL's ``monopolistic'' practices
involving its popular instant messaging system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a group of 16 companies released a policy paper
condemning AOL, saying it has put a virtual stranglehold on instant
messaging, a popular way to send quick notes to online ``buddies.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL's messaging system, with about 50 million users, is bigger
than all of its rivals combined. The 16 companies say AOL's system,
which blocks other instant message users from AOL members, hurts
both consumers and competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In June, AOL told the FCC it supports the idea of allowing its
messaging system to work with others, but said it had to move
slowly to protect its customers' privacy. The competitors, which
include Microsoft Corp.'s MSN, accuse AOL of stalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers deserve the right to communicate freely on the
Internet,'' said Margaret Heffernan, CEO of iCast Corp., one of the
16 instant messaging rivals. ``AOL is robbing IM users of this
right.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, regulators primarily are concerned about the online
delivery of entertainment. That's because AOL has a four-year
agreement with Bertelsmann AG, Germany's largest media company,
guaranteeing that company will have access to AOL as a marketplace
for its music, television and publishing content.
</P>
<P>
   By combining with Time Warner, AOL also will gain ''preferential
access to the leading source of music publishing rights and music
repertoire'' in much of Europe, the European Commission said. Given
that advantage, AOL could become the ''gatekeeper in the emerging
online music distribution channel.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as competitors and consumer advocates continue to
criticize the merger, AOL and Time Warner executives are insisting
they will play fair. In a recent letter to the FCC, the companies
promised to use as many distribution methods as possible. Rather
than trying to force-feed its content through Time Warner cable
lines, the merged company would offer service via digital
subscriber lines and satellite, the letter said.

IT'S AN EXCLUSIVE SHOP: NO CALIFORNIANS ALLOWED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: optional sidebar at end of article)  
 By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The opening of the only shop in the city devoted to
wines from New York state might ordinarily attract attention for
that alone. But what may cause the biggest stir is the fact that it
is the only mainstream wine shop in the city allowed to open on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The store, called Vintage New York, on Broome and Wooster
Streets in Soho, will eventually carry 150 wines from the state's
four wine regions: Long Island, the Finger Lakes, the Hudson Valley
and Lake Erie-Chautauqua. Every wine on hand can be tasted on the
premises, a tempting possibility because so many of them are not
otherwise available in shops or restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York City you don't see New York wines,'' said Susan
Wine, who opened the shop with her partner, Robert Ransom, last
week. ``We are bringing the country to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, they are. The couple also own the Rivendell Winery in
New Paltz in the Hudson Valley, which is why Vintage New York is
allowed to do things that wine and spirits shops in the city cannot
_ like open on Sunday. In 1984, legislation deregulating the
state's wine industry allowed farm wineries like Rivendell to sell
wine in their tasting rooms, and to open as many as five stores
across the state. (Farm wineries produce less than 150,000 gallons
a year _ about 63,000 cases.) The stores were seen as tasting
rooms, places where the wineries could sell their own wines as well
as those from other New York producers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16 years since the law was passed, 20 such stores have
opened across the state. The wonder is that Vintage New York is the
first in the city. On Sunday, not long after the store opened, at
least a dozen customers were prowling the aisles, audibly marveling
at the idea of being able both to taste and to buy on a day when
beer is ordinarily the only alcohol option at retail.
</P>
<P>
   The shop, open on Sunday from noon to 9 p.m., and Monday to
Saturday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., is also allowed to sell food and
carries artisanal products from New York state. They include Egg
Farm Dairy cheeses, Hudson Valley Farmhouse Cider, organic duck
breasts, Wild Thymes Farm salad dressings, fruit spreads and
Woelffer verjus.
</P>
<P>
   The three-level shop has two bars, on the top and bottom floors,
where every wine can be sampled. A $5 fee charged for tasting five
wines is refunded with a $50 purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The airy 3,500-square-foot space is partly standard-issue SoHo
(church-size windows, track lighting, brick walls painted cream)
and partly Mendocino modern (giant photos of pendulous grape
clusters; oak flooring and blond-ash shelves that resemble
Champagne houses' cave racks; accessories and ceramics with
vineyard themes). The arched basement, fitted out for catering,
will be used for classes on food and wine and presentations by
guest chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Wine, who owned the Quilted Giraffe with her former husband, and
Ransom selected their inventory ``after literally visiting every
winery in the state and tasting their wines over two years,'' he
said. They chose the SoHo neighborhood because a restaurateur
friend told them that it represents ``a mini-vacation, even for New
Yorkers who go out to dinner.'' It also attracts hordes of
travelers who might buy a bottle as a souvenir. Ransom said that if
the store succeeded, he might open a second one in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Johnnes, the wine director at Montrachet in Tribeca and
an importer, visited the store and said he was impressed by the
range of styles and varieties available. ``People don't take New
York seriously,'' he said. ``But Long Island is serious. Millbrook
in the Hudson Valley is serious. Of course, there can be
inconsistencies and disappointments. People are fixated on big
wines _ chardonnays and merlots. But they need to keep an open
mind. The hybrids and fruit wines in New York can be wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Vintage New York's selection represents a tour d'horizon of
grapes and wines, simple through sophisticated, that have governed
the three stages of New York's wine industry, which began in the
1820s: Northeastern labrusca, like Wagner's 1998 Delaware from the
Finger Lakes; French-American hybrids, like Rivendell's 1998 seyval
blanc, from the Hudson Valley; and classical European vinifera,
like Paumanok's 1997 merlot, from the North Fork of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest-priced beverage available is Warwick Valley's Doc's
Draft Hard Apple Cider, from the Hudson Valley, which is $4.50 for
650 milliliters; the most expensive wine is the 1997 Woelffer
Estate Selection merlot from the South Fork, at $30 for a
750-millilter bottle.
</P>
<P>
   In gallons of wine produced, New York ranks behind California
and Washington and ahead of Oregon. But its wines have no unified
image. New York City residents' impressions have most recently been
influenced by the fast-growing Long Island wine industry, which has
been cool to collaboration with other regions because it might blur
the East End's image.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Vintage New York carries 13 categories of wines, defined not by
grape variety but by style: sparkling; sweeter white; light-,
medium- and full-bodied whites and reds; blushes and sweet reds;
wines from native grapes; fruit wines and mead; fortified wines;
and after-dinner wines.
</P>
<P>
   With rieslings growing more popular, Vintage New York offers 11.
Nine are from the Finger Lakes, which many experts think is the
most promising cool-climate riesling-producing zone in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   At least two previous attempts by upstate winemakers to drop
anchor in New York City failed. Wagner Vineyards, on Seneca Lake,
sold its own numerous wines in a shop on the East Side but closed
it in 1988 after losing money for two and a half years. In 1994,
Hunt Country, a winery on Keuka Lake, established a distributorship
called Wineship to bring Finger Lakes wines to New York City stores
and restaurants but shut it down after a year. ``We didn't have the
economies of scale to make a lot of money,'' said Arthur Hunt, an
owner of the winery.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage New York's Sunday advantage holds for now. On June 28,
the State Liquor Authority voted to end Sunday openings, but on
July 12 it delayed putting the decision into effect.

   GETTING TO KNOW YOUR LOCAL WINEMAKER
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Nearly 3,000 wines are produced in New York state, according to
the New York Wine &AMP; Grape Foundation, and the Vintage New York shop
will eventually carry 150 of them. Here is a half-case selection
that gives a sense of the styles and quality of the stock at the
shop, and of New York wines in general.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Frank Blanc de Blancs sparkling wine, 1995 (Finger
Lakes, $25), the single best Champagne-style wine made in New York
state.
</P>
<P>
   Hermann J. Wiemer dry riesling, 1998 ($10), from the the most
accomplished riesling producer in the Finger Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Konstantin Frank Rkatsiteli, 1998 (Finger Lakes, $16), a
popular wine with a lemon-lime flavor, made from an especially
flavorsome grape found widely in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Creek reserve chardonnay, 1998 (North Fork, $17), a
plainly delicious wine.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider cabernet franc, 1998 (North Fork, $23), an outstanding
example of a grape that may, in coming years, transcend merlot as
Long Island's most significant variety.
</P>
<P>
   Pellegrini unfiltered cabernet sauvignon, 1997 (North Fork,
$18), a good example of the winemaker's opulent style.

WYOMING REACTS WARMLY TO CHENEY'S SELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
 (With BUSH-CHENEY) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Wyo. _ While Dick Cheney's ascension from vice
presidential screener to vice presidential running mate might have
surprised Republicans in other parts of the country, the reaction
of those who know him in his home state of Wyoming was, ``What took
them so long?''
</P>
<P>
   ``People here still think he should have run for president the
last time,'' said Wyoming's former senator, Alan Simpson,
reflecting a reverence that many state residents hold for Cheney, a
former White House chief of staff, congressman and secretary of
defense and well-known fly fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   ``So to us,'' Simpson added, ``this is no real surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   By selecting Cheney to join the ticket with him, Gov. George W.
Bush has drawn Wyoming, an overwhelmingly Republican state, into a
rare spotlight of national politics at the highest level. The state
has produced a slew of memorable congressmen over the years,
including Simpson, Clifford P. Hansen and Gale McGee and even a
Supreme Court justice, Willis Van Devanter, who served from 1911 to
1937.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney, 59, who moved to Wyoming from Nebraska as a
teen-ager, would be the first Wyomingite ever elected to either of
the nation's highest offices, a possibility not lost on many of his
friends and acquaintances here in Jackson, where he has a $2.8
million home just off the Teton Pines golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any bigger than this,'' said Jan Larimer, a
Jackson resident who is co-chairman of the Republican National
Convention, which starts next week in Philadelphia. ``We're a state
with just three electoral votes so this was never on anyone's radar
screen. So for a person of this stature, from out-of-the-way
Wyoming to get the vice presidential nomination, that's pretty
terrific. We're all just bursting our buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Scarlett, who has known Cheney and his wife, Lynne, for
more than 30 years, said: ``To people in the state, it's an
acknowledgment of Wyoming values and the kind of people who live
here. I'm sure the entire state is genuinely happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends like Larimer and Scarlett say Cheney personifies the
state, as a rugged, straight-forward, no-nonsense, self-effacing
man who exudes a communal spirit that is not only prevalent but
necessary in the state with the fewest people.
</P>
<P>
   Those qualities especially stand out in Jackson, a haven for the
rich and famous who have helped give Teton County, in the northwest
part of the state, the highest per-capita income of any county in
the nation. Among a group that includes movie stars like Harrison
Ford, business tycoons like Tom Kelleher of Southwest Airlines and
Edwin L. Artzt, former chairman of Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., Cheney has
distinguished himself for his selflessness, his friends say.
</P>
<P>
   When Cheney moved here after 10 years in Washington as Wyoming's
congressman, he drove his own furniture in a U-Haul trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that our Dick Cheney, or what?'' said Clarene Law, a state
lawmaker and close friend of the Cheneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the nicest, most unassuming and intelligent people
I have ever met,'' said Stephen Vletas, the owner of Westbank
Anglers, who has taken many of Jackson's high-profile residents
onto the Snake River for a day of fly fishing. He recalled some as
loud, selfish, disrespectful and boastful, but not Cheney, he said,
who has fished with him about six times or so in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dick comes in the shop, he's so polite; he always stands
off to the side and waits his turn, never interrupting anyone
else,'' Vletas added. ``He's so different from every other
politician I've guided. I always had a true sense that he cared
about what he was doing and what was best for the American people.
I wish he'd have run for president last time instead of Bob Dole.''

   UNDATED _ Even though Hueco Tanks State Historical Park was
considered a rock-climbing mecca, once attracting enthusiasts from
as far as Europe, only a few now scale its cliffs and boulders.
And, avid climber Jeffrey Drucker is moving away. Drucker, a
physics professor at nearby University of Texas at El Paso, says
the state's clampdown on access at the far West Texas park _ to
protect ancient cave drawings _ was a factor in his departure for
Arizona. By BILL HANNA. Story has moved in ``a'' general news

stubborn rocks remain, and they'll soon be dislodged. The residents
of Throckmorton, 125 miles northwest of Fort Worth, are eagerly
looking forward to Friday, when the last length of pipe will be
laid in that ditch and life-giving water can once again flow freely
to the town. Cars are dirty and lawns are brown in Throckmorton. By

   GROOM, Texas _ Texas Panhandle resident Steve Thomas knows about
suffering. And he has built the state's largest cross _ 192 feet
high _ to remind humans they can overcome suffering and shame too,
just as Christ did centuries ago. The giant white cross, lighted at
night on the Texas prairie just east of Amarillo, is a brilliant
beacon for truck drivers and others seeking solace as they drive
down Interstate 40 past the small town of Groom. By JIM JONES.

` THOMAS AND THE MAGIC RAILROAD ' : CHILD'S TALE WITH A TOUCH OF
MENACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By   ELVIS MITCHEL L    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The immensely talented Alec Baldwin plays Mr. Conductor in
``Thomas and the Magic Railroad,'' which moves the PBS children's
show ``Shining Time Station'' to the big screen. He offers not only
the most seductively menacing voice ever heard from a good guy in a
G-rated movie, but also a vigor not normally seen in such a
picture. The amiable torpor of the film is left in a shambles after
each of his scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mr. Conductor is only 18 inches tall, Baldwin's brio
makes him as big as the smiling trains in the fantasy railroad
yard.
</P>
<P>
   In the early television episodes of ``Shining Time Station,''
where the I-Know-I-Can adventures of Thomas the Tank Engine, the
talking train, unfold, Mr. Conductor was played &UR;  &LR; by Ringo Starr
(who was replaced by George Carlin). Starr was so lovably oblivious
to everything, including shouts of sell-out by his former band's
biggest fans, that he was an ideal choice for a paperweight-size
imp. His woozy calm conferred an air of believability on the show,
and his approach was the opposite of Baldwin's.
</P>
<P>
   The feature film does share several things with the television
show, chief among them the concept that it's staged for either very
young or very sleepy children. It's very slow, though it does offer
a respite from the overactive animation that kids are mostly
subjected to.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and his steam engine friends, who were introduced in
``The Railway'' series of books by the Rev. Wilbert Vere Awdry,
have to race against a mean diesel engine and his dumb cronies to
prevent them from destroying the magical land in which they live.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about a vanishing supply of magic dust, which
probably accounts for the glumness of Peter Fonda, who plays a
grandfather longing for his happy childhood. (Fonda, whose
character is too depressed to be intimidated by Baldwin's ferocity,
seems to be starring in ``Ulee's Train.'') Mara Wilson, the young
actress who played one of the children in ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' and
starred in ``Matilda,'' portrays his granddaughter. Michael E.
Rodgers, as Mr. C Junior, Mr. Conductor's Scottish surfer-dude
cousin, neither overacts nor sleepwalks through the picture.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose you could make a case for ``Thomas and the Magic
Railroad,'' that it is functioning as a metaphor for maintaining
the innocence of childhood, which is just the thing parents will
have the time to do during this extremely poky movie. It's like
watching one of those live-action children's shows of the  &UR; ' &LR; 70s,
in which not much happens but it all takes place slowly and
emphatically (imagine a feature film version of ``Mr. Rogers'
Neighborhood'' without the same assumption of its young audience's
intelligence).
</P>
<P>
   The primitive brightness of the sets and Baldwin's intensity,
which is just as garish, is vaguely reminiscent of those harshly
colored, badly overdubbed ``Pippi Longstocking'' movies that left
many young audience members shivering through nightmares. Baldwin's
attack _ there's no better way to put it _ is unforgettable. He's
the first shrunken narrator with a serial killer's swagger.

FOR FRANCE, TARNISH DIMS A SUPERSONIC STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In a nation that cherishes its symbols of excellence,
the French dream of aviation superiority crashed a little bit along
with the Concorde Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the French, the famed supersonic jet shared a glamorous
stage with champagne, the Cannes film festival, and truffles. It
was expensive, patronized by movie stars and royalty.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest commercial plane on the planet, the Concorde gave
the French some room to boast in a world where accolades for
technological advancements often went to the United States or the
Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, that dream deflated, as stunned Parisians came to grips
with the fact that the plane they held up as the best in the world
was, also, fallible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Concorde is an important symbol for us, a ymbol for
France'' said Daniel Tresfield, 40, as he lounged against a
streetlamp in the festive Les Halles neighborhood of Paris. ``I
would like to fly on the Concorde, because it is very expensive,
and I am very poor. It is for the stars, for the very rich.''
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde ``is the best,'' Jean-Claude Soboul, 38, mused as
he hawked T-shirts to tourists near the Pompidou Center, a common
meetingplace for local youth. ``Remember the Titanic? It was the
best one, no? It was supposed to be the one that wouldn't sink.''
</P>
<P>
   Many French are proud of their plane, so fast, such an icon for
a country that has an international reputation for insisting on the
very best. It fit an image that demanded purity in language, food
and fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Parisians fear, the country may have lost a little bit of
the luster that came from producing the vehicle of such high-class
travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be culpability for France. The French people will
feel culpability,'' said Valerie Lambert, 37, as she made her way
across the San Michel bridge over the Seine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Concorde, it is the most beautiful plane in the world.
It's the French symbol of technology,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But many Parisians said they thought it unfair that a plane that
had suffered just one crash in decades would be singled out for
public criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old, old plane. I mean, that plane was (developed)
when Charles de Gaulle was president of the republic,'' said Nadim
Benarne, 45, as he perused a menu at a riverside cafe. ``So many
planes crash. For the Concorde, it's the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of a Concorde crashing, ever,'' said Houman
Zahedi, 30. ``It's very terrible, very tragic. But like it goes,
nothing is 100 percent foolproof.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Paris residents noted the strange foreboding of trouble
only the day before, when the European press was focusing on a
technological problem on one of the planes, and the fact that the
line has not been making money recently.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of profitability, several people said, was bound to
reduce the Concorde's flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a symbol of France, but a symbol of the past, of the
'70's,'' said a German resident of Paris, who would identify
himself only by his first name, Wolf. ``It's a symbol for France,
not of France.''

&HT;     BUSH-CHENEY ENVIRONMENTAL RECORDS COME UNDER ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As George W. Bush was announcing Tuesday that
former Cabinet official Dick Cheney will be his running mate, the
environmental records of both candidates came under attack from
conservation advocates and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George W. Bush represents the biggest threat to the
environment in the 2000 presidential election, then Dick Cheney is
clearly the second biggest,'' said Deb Callahan, president of the
Washington-based League of Conservation Voters, at a news
conference here.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Cheney, a Wyoming congressman from 1979 to 1989,
voted to reduce funding for the Interior Department and to postpone
economic sanctions against cities and counties that failed to meet
requirements of the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan also said Cheney voted against a permanent ban on oil
and gas drilling in wilderness areas and against requiring
polluters to report any significant emissions of hazardous
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney's likely nomination as vice president might be good
news for the oil industry, but not for the majority of voters who
want stronger, not weaker, environmental protections,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, has been chief executive officer of Halliburton Co.,
a Dallas-based oil-field services and construction company, for the
last five years. He also served as White House chief of staff under
President Gerald Ford and as secretary of defense under Bush's
father, President George H. W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between his voting record in Congress and his time as CEO of
Halliburton, Cheney has shown that his priorities do not include
protecting the nation's air, water and natural resources,''
Callahan charged.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican strategist Charles Black, who has been a
consultant to the Texas governor, said Callahan was attempting to
``smear Cheney's record on environmental issues. This is a man who
has always fought to protect the environment while not impeding
economic progress,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democrats went after Bush's environmental record in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., released a report by the
Environmental Working Group, a Washington-based advocacy
organization, that said Texas ranked first in the nation in failure
to conduct inspections of major Clean Water Act violators during
fiscal 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Gov. Bush, Texas has basically let the major polluters
police themselves,'' McDermott said. ``If the governor is elected,
it will be a major threat to America's rivers and oceans.''
</P>
<P>
   The report analyzed inspection data collected by the
Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees the nation's major
pollution control laws but gives the states enforcement authority.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Saitas, executive director of the Texas Natural
Resource Conservation Commission, which enforces EPA rules, called
the findings ``wholly unfair'' and ``false.''
</P>
<P>
   Saitas said the national study's references to Texas were
``based on flawed data.'' He said a number of state inspections
that EPA said were not done were actually completed after the
deadline EPA had set and that certain businesses cited as polluters
had been closed down.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore, often points to
Texas as the nation's most polluted state. Gore cites EPA reports
showing that Houston last year surpassed Los Angeles as nation's
smoggiest city, and that Texas ranked No. 1 in the country in the
number of days with unhealthy ozone levels.

HOSPITAL TEAM FLIES TO BERMUDA TO RESCUE AILING INFANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was sunrise over Bermuda one day last month when a
Coast Guard jet took off and raced toward Boston, bearing a rapidly
failing baby and a Children's Hospital medical team that had flown
in to work through the night in an attempt to save him.
</P>
<P>
   The baby, who had a heart defect that no physician on the island
could treat, was named Valiant by a mother who was inspired by the
comic-strip knight of old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wanted a child who was brave and fearless and could
conquer any situation,'' said his mother, Shirlene Ming-Santucci,
in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But after only two weeks of life, Valiant's time was already
running out. A narrowed heart valve forced blood to build up in his
heart and lungs, starving the rest of his 7-pound body. Getting him
to Boston, his local pediatrician decided the evening of June 27,
was his only hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's team _ Dr. Kate Ackerman, a pediatrician, and
Christine Katucki, a transport nurse _ tended the boy on the
770-mile flight back to Boston, but saw that he was weakening even
more as an ambulance sped from the airport toward Children's.
</P>
<P>
   ``His blood pressure was dropping dangerously,'' said Ackerman
Tuesday. The blood pressure device measured 40 over 30, and then
``just stopped reading,'' she said.''
</P>
<P>
   Urgent missions are routine for Children's transport team, which
carried out 900 of them between last October and June. Most were by
ground transport, but 65 involved aircraft. Yet the case of the
Bermuda baby illustrates just how far a hospital, even in this age
of managed care, is prepared to go to save one life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the most life-or-death transport I've been on,'' said
Ackerman, who is a fellow in critical care pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   A team of cardiologists, anesthesiologists and other specialists
had been assembled at the hospital. They would use a balloon-tipped
catheter threaded through Valiant's tiny arteries to his heart's
aortic valve, which a birth defect had narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 minutes after the baby arrived, the team headed by Dr.
James Lock, chief of cardiology, and Dr. Stanton Perry, head of the
cardiac catheterization lab, began inserting the catheter into a
groin artery. They worked the balloon tip into the heart valve in
less than 8 minutes, said Dr. Mary Mullin, a cardiologist who
headed the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really impressive,'' said Mullin. ``It normally takes
longer than that.'' After the balloon inflated several times to
widen the valve, Valiant immediately looked better, she said.
Tuesday, the baby was doing well and was expected to be discharged
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The drama began in the afternoon, when the pediatrician in
Bermuda called Children's to say his little patient was weakening
after having done well for almost two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin, who advised the doctors and nurses at the small Bermuda
hospital on the phone, said it was immediately clear that Valiant
``absolutely needed to be in a setting where the valve could be
opened up,'' and Bermuda had no pediatric cardiologists with such
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Normally the hospital hires a private air transport service _
which is usually covered by the patient's insurance _ but on this
day a line of thunderstorms along the East coast meant that the
North Carolina-based service couldn't fly.
</P>
<P>
   Katucki, the transport nurse, then turned to the U.S. Coast
Guard, whose planes can fly through rougher weather. The Coast
Guard agreed to send an HU25 Falcon _ similar to a civilian Lear
Jet _ and crew, including the pilots, Lt. Robert Barthelmes and Lt.
Cdr. Paul Hansen, based at Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard provides such flight on the merits of each
situation, and doesn't charge for them. Ming-Santucci said her
insurance company would cover the cost of the surgery but not the
salaries and expenses of the transport team, which will be paid for
by Children's.
</P>
<P>
   The plane flew to Logan International Airport to pick up the
Children's team. Ackerman _ who had to run home to get her passport
_ and Katucki arrived at Logan in an ambulance carrying a high-tech
but heavy isolette to put the baby in, along with several oxygen
tanks and six bags of medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Bermuda, the Children's team found Valiant breathing
via a throat tube and sedated. Ackerman ordered lab tests; they
showed that the baby's condition was worsening. The doctor ordered
drugs to boost the heart and replaced the breathing tube with a
larger one.
</P>
<P>
   For Ackerman, this was the toughest part. ``We needed to get him
back quickly, but every time we started to leave he became more
unstable,'' she said. To make matters worse, the Coast Guard pilots
had now been awake nearly 24 hours and were at their prescribed
limits: soon they would be forced to leave and send a fresh crew
back. If that had happened, the baby wouldn't have survived, said
Ackerman. ``It was a judgment call,'' she said. ``We decided to
pack him up and hope he'd make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic was heavy at Logan when the plane arrived about 7
a.m., so Barthelmes and Hansen requested a special clearance to
land on a runway close to where the Children's ambulance was
parked.
</P>
<P>
   After the emergency procedure opened Valiant's heart valve and
the immediate crisis was past, he began to improve rapidly. About a
week later doctors operated to patch a hole in his heart that made
blood flow the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, cardiologist Mullin said that the infant ``looks
terrific'' and didn't suffer any lasting effects from being in
heart failure for so many hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a wonderful feeling to see the mother holding a baby who
was so critically ill and have her about to return home with a
normal baby,'' Mullin said.

DEGRAAN PRESIDENT OF GILLETTE; ON TRACK TO BECOME CEO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a move that had been expected, Gillette Co. said
Tuesday that its board of directors has elevated executive vice
president Edward F. DeGraan, 57, to the vacant posts of president
and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming a new role at a time when the razor giant has been
delivering subpar performances, DeGraan becomes the likely
frontrunner to succeed Gillette chairman and chief executive
Michael C. Hawley, 62.
</P>
<P>
   In recent memory every Gillette president, including Hawley, has
been ultimately promoted to chief executive. Since Hawley's
ascension to the top job last year, the position of president had
been left open.
</P>
<P>
   As president, it will be up to DeGraan to cut costs, boost sales
and profits and help Hawley get Gillette back into investors' good
graces.
</P>
<P>
   All Gillette product lines will report to DeGraan.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single, focused point of control over operations will
further align our global product-line strategies and commercial
sales execution, resulting in greater innovation, efficiency, and
cost-savings,'' Gillette spokesman Eric Kraus said of DeGraan's
promotion. ``This appointment will also create a balanced span of
responsibilities between the chief executive and president.''
</P>
<P>
   For most the of 1990s, Gillette was a robust performer. But in
the last two years, its momentum has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   As a company that gets about two thirds of its revenues from
overseas, it has been hurt by a strong dollar and troubled
economies in some of its major foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gillette said both second-quarter revenues and
earnings from continuing operations rose 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While its razor business continues to boom, few of the
Gillette's other divisions turned in impressive results.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, three of the 12 analysts who follow Gillette
have downgraded their ratings on the company, according to First
Call Corp., a Thomson Financial company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel this company has a lot of long-term potential,''
said Patrick Schumann, an analyst with Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumann said he remains concerned about the near-term
performance of Gillette's Duracell battery division and expressed
disappointment that Gillette decided not to sell some of its Braun
small-appliance product lines.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gillette said it entered exclusive negotiations to
sell its stationery division to Newell Rubbermaid Inc.
</P>
<P>
   With DeGraan's promotion, Gillette has hinted at its succession
plans. But is Wall Street willing to wait until Hawley reaches
retirement age?
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, investors and corporate boards have expressed
impatience with newly appointed chief executives who didn't deliver
improved results almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Such consumer giants as Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., Coca-Cola Co., and
Campbell Soup Co. have seen the abrupt departures of chief
executives with little more time in the top job than Hawley.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a South Boston longshoreman, DeGraan is a graduate of
Suffolk University. He will now also serve on Gillette's board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Gillette shares rose 43.75 cents
to close at $30.1875.

HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY BRINGS RELIEF TO KIDS WITH CEREBRAL
PALSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When he started hyperbaric oxygen therapy
last February, Kenton Morgan's leg muscles had become so
constricted, his knees clamped together and his lower legs
scissored across each other. He could no longer straddle a horse.
</P>
<P>
   For the 13-year-old with cerebral palsy, that was tragic.
</P>
<P>
   Kenton, who lives in the Fort Worth suburb of Burleson, loves
therapeutic riding. It's his main social activity. His mother says
he talks nonstop to the three helpers who lead and walk alongside
the horse he's riding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do love horses,'' Kenton says. ``I got thrown off a horse
once. It was scary _ for Mom. ... My side walker caught me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenton's orthopedic surgeon recommended muscle-release surgery
to correct the problem but warned that the procedure might have to
be repeated as Kenton grows.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Ken Morgan, got on the Internet and says he made
``about a jillion phone calls,'' looking for alternatives. He found
an experimental hyperbaric oxygen treatment program for cerebral
palsy at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Breathing pure oxygen under increased pressure allows blood
vessels to carry more oxygen deeper into tissue throughout the
body, including the brain. The capillaries diffuse blood farther
(into tissue) when they are under pressure, so that oxygen-rich
blood is carried into areas it can't reach under normal pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperbaric oxygen is most often used to treat carbon monoxide
poisoning and for hard-to-heal wounds such as crush injuries
involving severe trauma to bone, soft tissue, nerves and blood
vessels. It also is used to heal radiation and thermal burns,
poisonous spider bites and foot injuries associated with diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   For brain injuries, research guidelines call for 60 ``dives,''
one hour each day, five days a week. A treatment is called a dive
because oxygen is administered under atmospheric pressure
equivalent to that of diving underwater _ 17 feet underwater, in
the case of CP treatments.
</P>
<P>
   For the Morgans, it meant moving to Galveston, temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   After only a week of treatment, Kenton _ who for years was fed
intravenously and with feeding tubes and has never had any appetite
_ was demanding hamburgers and french fries. He has been off all
supplemental feedings since a week after starting the oxygen
therapy last February and has gained 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 20 dives, we noticed a definite improvement in the
elasticity of his muscles,'' says Tamie Morgan, Kenton's mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to get him dressed with his legs in a vise lock.
Now, both his legs and arms have more elasticity, and his hands are
not in such tight little fists. He had begun to keep his arm pulled
up tight to his chest. Now, you can extend his arms and he can
relax them,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgans are hopeful that other Fort Worth-area children with
cerebral palsy will benefit from the hyperbaric oxygen treatments.
</P>
<P>
   They have helped organize a medical study that will include 20
children at the Wound Healing and Hyperbaric Medicine Center at the
Osteopathic Medical Center of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as exciting a day for us as the day Kenton started the
treatment in Galveston,'' Ken Morgan said recently at an
orientation session for participants and their families. The first
of four groups of children will begin receiving hyperbaric oxygen
treatment here in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will know more after we follow the first group for six
months,'' says Dr. Alvin Mathe, who is directing the study. ``We
know oxygen therapy helps with spasticity. I'll be happy if I see
some improvements, whatever they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathe is associate director of the Wound Healing and Hyperbaric
Oxygen Medicine Center at Osteopathic Medical and an associate
professor of internal medicine at the University of North Texas
Health Science Center.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   OMCT has had the hyperbaric chamber since 1993, but it was not
used for cerebral palsy until this summer, when Ken Morgan found
out about it and asked Mathe to set up a program to help Kenton and
other children with CP.
</P>
<P>
   Mathe has provided 20 follow-up treatments for Kenton since his
return from Galveston, as well as 20 follow-up dives for Katie
Jones, a 10-year-old Fort Worth girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had 40 treatments in Toronto, and we could definitely see
improvements,'' says Angela Jones, Katie's mom. ``She has always
been nonverbal, and now she does a lot of jabbering and makes new
sounds she hasn't before. The speech pathologist here says there is
a big difference in her facial muscle tone. Also, she had a really
tight left arm that was always drawn up with her hand in a tight
fist, and now she's trying to use that hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Katie's endurance is a lot better, too. Before the treatments,
she could only take six or seven steps with support from her mother
or therapist before she collapsed. Now she has started dancing with
her 8-year-old sister, her mother says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just keeps going and going, and she's a lot more alert. We
were planning on going back to Canada, but then Dr. Mathe agreed to
give her HO here. They are doing it all over the world, but only 13
places in the U.S. offer the treatment for CP. To have it close to
home where she can also continue her physical therapy is
unbelievably better.''
</P>
<P>
   Osteopathic Medical Center will provide physical therapy three
days a week and other medical support for children in the study,
including ear tubes for children who have difficulty clearing their
ears in atmospheric pressure equal to that at 17 feet underwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``HO will not regenerate lost brain cells that have died from
lack of oxygen, but it can rejuvenate or revive some of the
inactive cells that may just not be getting enough oxygen to do
much other than maintain themselves,'' says Dr. Irvine Prather,
director of hyperbaric medicine at OMCT.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all these families, there is a certain amount of
desperation involved in all this, so we definitely want to avoid
offering false hope, but right now it looks good for CP. These kids
are going to make some developmental milestones,'' Prather says. If
this study goes well, he adds, the medical center hopes to follow
up with enlarged studies.
</P>
<P>
   Cerebral palsy is a disorder that results from a wide spectrum
of brain injuries, often associated with premature birth and
including strokes before birth, bleeding in the brain at birth,
brain injuries in early childhood accidents or near drownings. It
is marked by different levels of mental and physical impairment,
depending on which part of the brain is injured.
</P>
<P>
   The only known risks associated with hyperbaric oxygen treatment
at the levels to be used in the study are difficulty clearing the
ears, some sinus pressure, temporary vision changes and possible
twitching. Lung problems and decompression sickness are sometimes
associated with higher pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The hyperbaric oxygen chamber is a 30,000-pound steel cylinder
that looks like a small submarine. It has space for 12 people.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for the study, which is free to the families involved,
is coming from private donations and trusts. Doctors are donating
their time, and the hospital is donating the equipment needed for
the study, Mathe says.
</P>
<P>
   The medical center is seeking additional funding for the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``For families, it's so uplifting,'' Ken Morgan says. ``There
are so many dead-ends with CP. You are constantly reminded that
eventually we are going to have to cut this tendon or that muscle.
This just seems so much better. Kenton's quality of life is better
and ours as parents is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's hope where there wasn't hope. All of us are scared of
what the future will be, and this just gives us more hope for the
future.''

<P>
   BALDISSERO CANAVESE, Italy _ The cottage cellar door seems to
lead to a basement toolshed. Actually it is the disguised entrance
to the ``Temple of Man,'' a five-story underground warren of vast,
ornately decorated chambers, with towering pillars, 40-foot-high
gold-leaf ceilings, giant frescoes and bronze statues, all linked
by narrow passages and concealed stone doors that spring open and
shut by electrical command.
</P>
<P>
   The temple looks like a cross between Xanadu and the
subterranean headquarters of a Bond villain plotting world
domination. Begun more than 20 years ago in total secrecy, it is
the spiritual core of Damanhur, a 23-year-old New Age commune
nestled, somewhat improbably, amid tiny rural villages in the
Piedmont valley of Valchiusella, in the foothills of the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Members reject the term cult, describing their commune as a
nation, one that aims at total self-sufficiency and boasts its own
currency, schools, federal and local government, newspapers, Web
site and tax code. It also claims to have its own unique
transportation system: time travel.
</P>
<P>
   But the oddest thing about Damanhur is not its belief system,
but the way it has melded California-style New Age spirituality
with the customs and mores of Northern Italy. When its 500
full-time residents are not experimenting with time travel and
``selfic'' healing, they are industriously churning out luxury
items for export.
</P>
<P>
   One Damanhur workshop makes Tiffany-style glass products.
Another business, Atelier Damjl, spins silk and cashmere fabrics on
18th-century wooden looms for Loro Piana and other top Italian
fashion houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never hippies,'' Damanhur's founder, Oberto Airaudi, a
former insurance salesman from Turin who goes by the name Falco
(Falcon), explained as he drove his silver Volvo station wagon up
steep mountain roads to the temple's helicopter pad. ``We believed
in hard work, personal responsibility and bank loans. It was our
own version of the American dream, all built with our own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   A Damanhurian candidate won last year's mayoral election in
nearby Vidracco, and the commune has town councilors in half a
dozen other small villages, worrying some locals who fear that the
commune, which keeps buying land, will soon rule the area. But
Damanhur's political goals are hardly unorthodox: the commune wants
a tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Damanhur, which took its name from an ancient Egyptian city,
also shares the Italian aversion to ironclad rules and has only
one: no smoking. Everything else is pretty much permitted,
including long lunches that include wine, pasta and meat, which may
help explain why the community has remained intact for more than
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place I can think of in the States with such
successful continuity,'' said David Fuess, 53, a visiting
acupuncturist from Carmel, Calif. Fuess, who uses Damanhur's gold
``selfic'' needles in his healing practice back home, said he was
troubled by only one aspect. ``I'd like to see them be totally
vegetarian,'' he said wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke after attending a packed lecture on the hidden risks of
time travel given by Airaudi. Those include being inadvertently
transported to an ``inhospitable'' primeval forest and being chased
by wolves.
</P>
<P>
   When Airaudi started it, Damanhur was a semiclandestine society
that drew Italian students and young professionals searching for
spirituality, paranormal research and a Marxist rejection of
private property.
</P>
<P>
   Members shed their civil names and adopt animal first names and
vegetable surnames. A current ``king-guide'' for example, is named
Gorilla Eucalipto.
</P>
<P>
   Damanhurians began digging their temple in secret, carrying
buckets by hand to carry out discarded earth and stone. After
rumors of a mysterious sect spread across the valley, Damanhurians
erected a false temple, in ancient Egyptian style, above the real
one as a decoy.
</P>
<P>
   But the real temple came to light in 1992 when one founding
member decided to quit the commune and threatened to expose its
doings unless all his worldly goods were restored. Turning over
one's assets to the commune is one of the prerequisites to full
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute went to court, and baffled Italian judges eventually
ruled in favor of the commune, but it was forced to pay back taxes
on the temple. Airaudi says work is still continuing to dig newer
underground chambers, 10 times as big.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Damanhur dispensed with its early
collectivist spirit and secrecy, and it has since embraced
capitalism and Internet-driven public relations (www.Damanhur.it).
Tourists can tour the temple for a $40 fee, and its bustling
workshops, healing centers and guest houses offer paid spiritual
retreats and seminars.
</P>
<P>
   But Damanhur's ardent work ethic and spiritual zeal wear thin on
some of the group's teen-agers. ``I don't exclude returning
someday, but right now I am sick of it,'' said 18-year-old
Cinciallegra (Titmouse), aka Melissa Baracco.
</P>
<P>
   She has lived in Damanhur since the age of 6. Her hair is dyed a
defiant, nonorganic pink, and she smokes _ off the premises. She
said she yearned to travel and be a normal teen-age slacker.
``Sometimes I just want to do nothing,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the commune draws middle-aged people interested in
mysticism and the paranormal. ``It is a deep, holistic, growthful
environment,'' Peta Lynne, 50, a visitor from the Hawaiian island
of Kauai, who described her day job there as a ``channeler.''
</P>
<P>
   When she began explaining how she rediscovered past lives, she
was cut off by Esperide Ananas, (Butterfly Pineapple), or Silvia
Buffagni, Damanhur's director of international public relations.
Buffagni rolled her eyes and impatiently explained that Damanhur
took a less ``fluffy'' approach to channeling, a somewhat rigid
distinction coming from one who claimed to have witnessed a fellow
Damanhurian travel through time to Atlantis.
</P>
<P>
   Residents along the valley, who live in villages deserted by
young people fleeing rural life and the absence of jobs, express
guarded admiration _ and concern about their neighbor's expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pay taxes, and I am not saying they haven't done some
good things: repainting Vidracco, adding a children's park and
other aesthetic touches,'' said Domenico Troia Cionin, the mayor of
Baldissero Canavese, referring to improvements made by the
Damanhurian mayor of Vidracco two miles away. ``But we feel a
little like Indians in the American West when the cowboys came.
They tried to resist, and utterly failed.''

   AIRFRANCE-CRASH (Gonesse, France) _ A chartered Air France
Concorde carrying mainly German tourists bound for New York crashed
in flames shortly after take-off from Charles de Gaulle Airport
outside Paris Tuesday, killing all 109 passengers and crew on board
and at least four people on the ground. It was the first ever crash
of a Concorde since the world's first supersonic passenger plane
went into commercial operation in 1976. By Alan Riding. (With photo
NYT1)
</P>
<P>
   AIRFRANCE-CRASH-SCENE (Roissy, France) _ Witnesses described the
brief, fiery flight of AF 4590 as a vision of hell or a kind of
bomb, in flames from the time it rolled down the runway until it
smashed three minutes later into a tiny, wooden hotel. In the
little town of Gonesse, barely four miles southwest of the airport,
there were reactions of shock and distress. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   AIFRANCE-CRASH-CONCORDE (Undated) _ Controversy has swirled
around the Concorde, the world's only supersonic passenger jet,
from the day it began development in 1962. But until Tuesday there
was one area where its record, by modern aviation standards, was
pristine: safety. The fatal crash of Air France Flight 4590, a
charter from Paris to New York, was the first of a Concorde after
more than 30 years of flying, an unusually long stretch for any
type of commercial aircraft. By Laurence Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   This story was not previosly skedded:
</P>
<P>
   AIRFRANCE-CRASH-GERMANY (Berlin) _ The shaken owner of a German
luxury tour operator appeared on national television Tuesday to
confirm that his company had chartered the Air France Concorde that
crashed near Paris. The passengers had paid between $4,200 and
$11,000 for a journey that was to begin in New York, the
destination of the doomed flight, and continue on a luxury
oceanliner called the ``Deutschland.'' The trip would have taken
the holidaymakers on a cruise through the Caribbean with a final
destination of Manta in Ecuador. By Roger Cohen.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Perhaps few people here really expected the Camp
David peace talks to end the conflict between Israelis and
Palestinians, but even fewer could guess Tuesday what will happen
now that the talks have failed.
</P>
<P>
   From folks on the street just getting word of the failure, to
analysts and politicians, tension seemed to rise with the
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want peace, but the Israelis did not,'' said Iman Abu
Nijmeh, a 30-year-old Palestinian mother in Jerusalem who strolled
with her family and worried about a new violence. ``Now, maybe it
won't be stones. Maybe it will be Kalashnikovs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible sorrow,'' said Israeli Moshe Mossek. ``I'm
afraid something will happen. Bloodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he boarded his plane from Washington Tuesday, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak himself said the future was wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the end of an important stage in the peace process
and at the opening of an era of quite a lot of uncertainty,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts, leaders and even casual observers, some
of the possibilities started to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   First, Arafat and Barak could face short-term praise among their
own peoples for refusing to enter into an agreement that would
require steep compromise. But both have promised progress in the
peace process, and without it they could fall out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   Violence could be averted depending on how leaders explain the
failure and whether they will, as promised, continue to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   If future talks fail, Arafat could go ahead with promises to
declare Palestinian statehood Sept. 13, when the negotiating period
is set to expire. Such an act could prompt Israeli reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the role of the United States will come under scrutiny.
Palestinians, who feel they have been compromising for years, may
be angered at U.S. President Bill Clinton's statements that
Israelis were more flexible in the talks. Israelis will cite his
comments for legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   In a hopeful view, most agree both sides thawed positions that
had appeared frozen for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Israel showed more willingness than ever to share Jerusalem and
to turn over large expanses of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians appeared ready to accept limits on the number of
refugees that can return to Israel. They also appeared ready to
allow several Jewish settlements to stay in West Bank lands claimed
by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   As many on both sides said, ``taboos'' were broken.
</P>
<P>
   But, the progress could still be overshadowed by the failure to
reach an agreement. It depends on how the leaders explain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on the nature of the failure,'' said
Palestinian political analyst Khalil Shikaki. ``If the two parties
reach the definite conclusion that there are things negotiations
will not resolve, then both will try to force the other to think
differently through pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to wait and hear what they say here,'' he added. ``Not
in Washington. Forget Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat made no statement before boarding his plane Tuesday. But,
Shikaki said Arafat can expect a ``hero's'' welcome for not caving
in to what Palestinians saw as pressure to sign a bad agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he will face increased pressure to make progress or
declare a state. Clinton's statements, that Barak appeared willing
to make more concessions than Arafat, could pin the blame on the
Palestinians and undercut international support for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, meanwhile, returns to a governing coalition that controls
only 42 seats in the 120-seat parliament. Any day, opponents who
were against his even going to the peace talks might be able to
force new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Already Tuesday, political opponents said that, even though he
had not made an agreement, he had offered compromises that would
come back to haunt Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of Israelis against the talks held a ``victory
celebration'' on a Jerusalem street.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, a former general, tried to offer the failure of the talks
and the violence that might follow as reasons for Israelis to unify
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In preparation for the upcoming days and their risks, we have
to set aside all the differences and unite, as we have known to do
so many times in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He sought reassurance in Clinton's statement that he had been
ready to make compromises for peace. Palestinians, however, saw the
comment as undercutting America's role as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that the U.S. supports the Israeli positions.
It weakens the credibility of the U.S., absolutely,'' said Marwan
Barghouti, a member of the Palestinian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Barghouti is a leader of Arafat's Fatah Party in the West Bank
and holds strong influence over the groups of armed youth that
Israelis fear may react violently to a peace talks failure. But, he
said there needs to be time for assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's necessary to go ahead to violence,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   More ominously, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of the
radical Hamas movement that has bombed Israeli cities in the past,
said the failure was proof that armed struggle was the only route
against the Israelis.

note dateline/byline changes and updated summaries:
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-TALKS (Washington) _ After 15 days of emotional
negotiations failed to end in an agreement at Camp David, President
Clinton closed the peace conference Tuesday by praising Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak for being ready to make hard compromises
but declaring that the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, would not
reciprocate. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-ASSESS (Thurmont, Md.) _ News Analysis: And on the 15th
day, the Israelis and the Palestinians packed their bags and left
their pastoral retreat at Camp David empty-handed, exhausted and
still conflicted. In immediate retrospect, the idea that they could
have resolved a 52-year-old, bitter, blood-soaked dispute in a
fortnight seems like the summit of idealism. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-REACT (Jerusalem) _ As news of the failure in Washington
spread across this ancient city, from television sets in cafes and
bars, from radios in the bazaars of the old city, and across the
network of mobile phones that have Israelis and Palestinians
engaging in seemingly non-stop talk even on days when there is no
major news, the more common reaction seemed to be one of
disappointment, confusion and even of fear. There was not, however,
much surprise. The likelihood of the Camp David negotiations
breaking down had been bannered across headlines here for days. By
John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-ISRAELIS (Jerusalem) _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
flew home from the breakup of the Camp David summit meeting Tuesday
night to a murky political future, his patchwork coalition in
tatters, his country sharply divided over the startling new
discussion of ceding parts of Jerusalem to some form of Palestinian
control. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-PALESTINIANS (Jerusalem) _ Palestinian officials said
after the collapse of the Camp David summit meeting Tuesday that
they would press ahead with plans to declare an independent state
on September 13. Placing the blame for the impasse squarely on
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, the officials asserted that
Yasser Arafat had made all the concessions possible before going
into the talks, and that his firm stance at Camp David would boost
his standing among his own people. By Joel Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-CLINTON (Washington) _ Twice in the past seven months
President Bill Clinton has invested enormous amounts of time and
prestige in an attempt to reach historic accords between Israel and
its neighbors, first the Syrians, then the Palestinians. In both
cases his aides bet that changing times and the force of Clinton's
own personality as a mediator with a finely honed sense for the
middle ground might be enough to win agreement, and with it a
legacy for a second term that historians are already discussing as
a series of lost opportunities. Twice so far, Clinton and his aides
have bet wrong.By Marc Lacey.

<P>
   MIDEAST-ARAB-LEADERS (Cairo) _ Palestinian officials here said
that Yasser Arafat would probably meet soon with many of the Arab
leaders who had urged him to hold firm on his demands for an end to
Israel's 33 years of exclusive control over East Jerusalem and the
Old City. By Susan Sachs.

 &HT;    CENSUS DENIES COUNTS WERE SHAKY AT 15 LOCAL OFFICES
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Census Bureau should review its population
counts in areas covered by 15 of the agency's 510 local offices
nationwide _ including parts of western and northwestern
metropolitan Atlanta _ to assure an accurate tally, according to
the House Republican who heads the subcommittee on the census.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., told reporters Tuesday he was concerned
that the Census Bureau was in ``a rush to finish at the expense of
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   But Census Bureau officials said there was no cause for concern,
and suggested that the Republican-controlled subcommittee was
misrepresenting the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Miller cited Census Bureau offices that encountered initial
resistance from the public in filling out their census forms and
then surged in later weeks of the count.
</P>
<P>
   The data from these offices suggests ``fraud or irregular
procedures,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman said the Census Bureau has ample quality-control
reviews in place and that there was no concern that the head count
in the Atlanta district or in the other 14 offices cited by Miller
had gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at those numbers every day,'' said Census Bureau
spokesman Steve Jost.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a report produced July 18 by the subcommittee's staff,
based on information supplied by the Census Bureau, Miller
questioned why the Atlanta-West office had a remarkable surge in
its count of the 55,280 housing units in its area of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta office _ which covers portions of downtown, College
Park, Hopeville and East Point _ jumped from 5 percent of all
households completed in the first week of the count to 23 percent
in the second week.
</P>
<P>
   Jost said the steep increase was due to an agency decision to
add additional census-takers to the Atlanta-West office, a common
practice in hard-to-count inner cities throughout the enumeration
period in April and May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have told the subcommittee not to misrepresent the data
because they are not easily interpretable to the public,'' Census
Director Kenneth Prewitt said in a conference call with reporters.
``But obviously they have not done so.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said his concerns were prompted by Census Bureau recounts
in portions of Chicago and Hialeah, Fla., because of suspicions
that census workers cut corners to complete the count.
</P>
<P>
   The other offices cited Tuesday by Miller include: three in the
Los Angeles area; two in New York City; two in Chicago; and one
office each in Philadelphia; Newark, N.J.; Marion County, Ind.;
Florence, Ala.; Las Vegas, Nev.; Rapid City, S.D.; and Newcastle,
Del.

CHOICE OF CHENEY LEAVES DEMOCRATS LOTS OF OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Officially, Texas Governor George W. Bush's
decision to take Richard B. Cheney as his running mate will have no
effect on Vice President Al Gore as he decides on his own running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, however, Democrats are war-gaming the possible
rejoinders, with Senator John F. Kerry's name moving quickly up the
mentioning chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are already two camps of punditry,'' said Bill Carrick,
a veteran Democratic strategist based in Los Angeles. `` `Oh, we
could trump this with Senator Mitchell' _ somebody who's equally
experienced and more moderate and less identified with past
administrations. Or we could go generational with Dick Durbin, Evan
Bayh, John Edwards, and John Kerry _ all youthful, vigorous
types.''
</P>
<P>
   The men Carrick listed are Democratic senators from Illinois,
Indiana, North Carolina and Massachusetts, respectively. Bayh is
the youngest at 45; Kerry, who will turn 57 in December, is the
oldest of the ``younger'' set. George Mitchell of Maine retired as
Senate Democratic leader and mediated the negotiations that led to
the Northern Ireland peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, yet another take on the Cheney choice for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't force us in any one direction,'' said a top Gore
official. ``It's liberating in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush had chosen Governor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a
critical state in the election, Gore might have felt a need to
respond with someone from another sharply contested state, such as
Florida Senator Bob Graham, several Democratic insiders said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if Bush had chosen Colin Powell or Elizabeth Dole, Gore
might have felt compelled to choose a woman or a member of a
minority.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gore can either match the experience of Cheney with the
experience of Maine's 66-year-old former senator, Mitchell, or he
could produce a bright and energetic politician to contrast with
Cheney, a fixture of the Republican conservative establishment who
looks older than his age, and whose experience dates back to the
days of the Ford administration.
</P>
<P>
   Even the campaign's on-the-record response to the Cheney pick
pounces on Bush's decision to call upon an older man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a retro pick,'' said Douglas Hattaway, Gore's spokesman.
``It's showing that Bush would take the country backward rather
than forward. He lacked the leadership to pick someone who
represents a new generation of Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bush's selection, Democrats also pointed out that the
Republicans are fielding a ticket in which neither candidate served
in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Bush was in the Texas National
Guard and Cheney received deferments keeping him away from service
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two people from the Vietnam generation who both missed
the war,'' said one Democratic official, pointing to Kerry's
war-hero status as a compelling contrast to Cheney's deferments.
Tuesday night, Kerry and Gore met at Kerry's Georgetown home during
a dinner to raise money for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday morning, Gore met with former Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, who is heading the search for his running mate.
The two, who have conducted previous meetings without public
notice, posed for the cameras before heading into the vice
president's residence at the US Naval Observatory for their
discussions this morning. Gore said the two had also talked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting down to what you would call a short list,'' Gore
said, ``but we still have some work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore would not discuss the size of the current list, or any of
the names on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through this process myself on the other side,''
Gore said. ``I want to keep it dignified, because one person is
going to be picked, and the others will not be, and I want those
who are not picked to feel respected and well-treated in this
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides also insisted that the vice president would do what
he thinks best, regardless of Bush's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't imagine Gore not having the Cheney thing in
mind,'' said Fred I. Greenstein, a presidency specialist at
Princeton University. ``Whether he factors it in would be another
question.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cheney's selection were to benefit anyone on Gore's rumored
short list, Greenstein said, it would be Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think of that short list, the one who does get a nudge
up is Mitchell,'' he said. ``If Cheney is a king, Mitchell is an
ace. None of them are household names but Mitchell has more
visibility than Cheney in that in the recent past, he hasn't been
running an oil company in Texas. Mitchell comes across with a
feeling of wiseman-ness, and an enormous list of tributes paid to
him by the Irish on all sides.''

&HT;     GAY REPUBLICANS BATTLE CONSERVATIVES OVER PLATFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (ATTN: Ariz., Calif., Wis.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gay Republicans strongly opposed to elements of the
party's platform are running into roadblocks erected by social
conservatives who on Tuesday vowed to defend language opposing
same-sex marriages and homosexual service in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Traditional Values Coalition and the
Family Research Council, both conservative bastions of opposition
to gay rights, met Tuesday with Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson,
chairman of the GOP committee that gathers in Philadelphia later
this week to hash out they party's platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt good about overall tenor of meeting, and it did sound
as if (the platform committee) would address some of our major
concerns,'' said Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's
vice president for public affairs. ``They don't want to sound
harsh. We're trying to work with them to find a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay Republicans ``want to neuter the platform so that next time
they can come in and say homosexual marriage is OK and gays in the
military are OK,'' said Andrea Sheldon, executive director of the
Traditional Values Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   A platform that does not oppose gay rights would be ``a defeat
for pro-Christian, pro-family voters who are inclined to vote
conservative Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with other contentious social issues such as
abortion, the gay rights issue is something of a thorn in the side
of Republicans and their presidential hopeful, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Bush is intent on reaching out to voting blocs
such as Hispanics that have not traditionally been courted by
Republicans. On the other hand, reaching out to gays would cost him
critical support from social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, the social conservatives want to block efforts
to eliminate the 1996 platform's stand against giving gays
protection under civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans, an association of gay Republicans,
and their supporters want to excise language favoring a ban on gays
in the military, and supporting the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act,
which permits states not to recognize same-sex marriages performed
in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute goes into its final stages this Friday and Saturday
when the GOP platform committee hashes out the final draft of the
party's 2000 platform in Philadelphia. Republicans attending the
convention then vote on the platform on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, gay Republicans say they give the Bush campaign
high marks for steering the party away from a confrontational tone.
Hostility to gays, for instance, surfaced in the 1992 GOP
convention when conservative candidate Patrick Buchanan called for
a ``cultural war'' against advocates of gay rights and abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind there's effort by the Bush camp to
send a message,'' said Rich Tafel, executive director of Log Cabin
Republicans, noting that for the first time an openly gay member of
Congress, Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., will address the convention.
``We appreciate their efforts. We understand it's a hassle for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 GOP platform states: ``We reject the distortion of
(civil rights) laws to cover sexual preference, and we endorse the
Defense of Marriage Act to prevent states from being forced to
recognize same-sex unions.''
</P>
<P>
   It also says: ``We oppose Bill Clinton's assault on the culture
and traditions of the Armed Forces, especially his attempt to lift
the ban on homosexuals in the military. We affirm that
homosexuality is incompatible with military service.''
</P>
<P>
   In line with Bush's effort to reach out, Thompson met with the
Log Cabin Republicans earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's spokesman, Kevin Keane, did not hold out much hope
for the gay Republican strategy. ``It all comes down to the 107
(platform committee) delegates who vote on what's in, and what's
not in, the platform,'' he said. ``I suspect it'll be tough to
change anything because the 107 delegates are from the more
conservative end of spectrum.''

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself met with 12 prominent gay Republicans in April and
declared himself ``a better person'' for having listened to their
pleas for greater inclusion in the GOP ranks. Still Bush did not
change his views, which run mostly parallel to the 1996 GOP
platform.
</P>
<P>
   The gays in the military issue is an exception. Bush has said he
supports the military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy that
permits gays in the military as long as they don't engage in
homosexual activity, and he opposes a return to a total ban on gays
in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tafel said gay Republicans are trying to look past the
Republican platform debate to the convention itself and Bush's
campaign against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some language unites and some pushes people out, and my sense
is (Bush) wants language that unites,'' Tafel said. ``The language
there now doesn't do that. But at the same time it's not something
the (Bush campaign) completely controls.''

LOST CHANCE FOR PEACE

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the nature of statecraft and of the Mideast that today's
missed opportunity may presage tomorrow's calamity. There is a
danger that something worse than frustration will result from the
failure of Israel and the Palestinians to strike a historic
compromise at Camp David after two weeks of negotiations shepherded
by President Clinton. Both sides will now be tempted to regress
toward familiar poses of pure intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Clinton acknowledged the stalemate at Camp David
than Israeli and Palestinian officials took to blaming the other
side for causing an impasse. Yasser Arafat's entourage complained
that the Israelis never budged from their refusal to concede
complete Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem. Members of
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's Israeli delegation blamed Arafat for
never once departing from his starting position on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton made a point of bestowing particular praise on
Barak for showing ``courage'' and ``vision,'' there was no
immediate benefit from the compromises offered by either side on
any of the core issues. The ground rules for the Camp David talks
precluded any partial progress, demanding as they did a
comprehensive and final agreement or no agreement at all.
</P>
<P>
   One ominous possibility is that, despite the areas of achievable
compromise revealed in the negotiations, Arafat's inability to
accept anything less than complete sovereignty over East Jerusalem
reveals a chasm that cannot be bridged anytime soon. The fault for
this difference on Jerusalem need not be blamed on Arafat or Barak
alone. Its origins are rooted in history, religion, and political
mythology.
</P>
<P>
   It is crucial that both leaders now keep their commitments to
refrain from taking unilateral actions. If Arafat carries out his
pledge to declare a Palestinian state unilaterally in the event
there is no negotiated agreement by Sept. 13, the gesture will
likely cause most harm to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   After a short interlude for reflection, Clinton should summon
the two sides back to the bargaining table to bridge their
differences. The alternative, as he said Tuesday, is unthinkable.

CHENEY'S MIXED RESUME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Myriad political assessments often mask what should be the one
overriding concern in the choice of a vice presidential candidate.
But Texas Governor George W. Bush had it right when he told an
audience in Austin Tuesday that he had chosen Richard Cheney
``because he is fully capable of being president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Bush could hardly be more on target. Starting at an
early age, Cheney compiled a record in the Nixon administration, as
chief of staff to President Ford, in Congress for 10 years, and as
secretary of defense for four years under President Bush that
rivals the qualifications of Lyndon Johnson in 1960 and Bush
himself in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney will have to show evidence of one other quality
essential to national leadership: the ability to command public
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was most visible to the nation as Pentagon chief during
the Gulf War. In helping to bring together an impressive
international coalition and to carry out the military strategy
effectively and with few US casualties, Cheney received praise that
was well deserved. There remains an undercurrent of those who
believe it was a grave mistake to leave Saddam Hussein in charge in
Iraq. Governor Bush, when asked this year to second-guess the
decision, told questioners to ask his father. Now, it will be
legitimate to ask his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his long resume, Cheney is often portrayed as an
elder statesman in the Republican Party. But in truth he is only
five years older than Bush and similar to him in many ways _ a
Texan (until Cheney registered back in Wyoming last week) with deep
connections to the oil industry and a very conservative political
record.
</P>
<P>
   Of the political considerations, two stand out. Despite his
close connection to President Bush, Cheney points up a major
difference in that he is a weightier choice for vice president than
Dan Quayle. Also, while Governor Bush's somewhat misspent youth is
occasionally questioned, he at least graduated from Yale, while
Cheney flunked out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cheney's sober personality may inspire public confidence.
This candidacy will give him the chance.

PAINTED PLATES? HOW 15 MINUTES AGO! 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some things you don't notice until they're gone. The
painted plate is one of them. It was not too many years ago that no
plate left a New York kitchen until, like a subway car parked
overnight in a rail yard, it had been decorated in drips, dots,
dabs and hash marks.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic squeeze bottles in hand, Manhattan's chefs rebelled at
the sight of white. Every square inch of blank, shiny china
beckoned like a freshly stretched canvas, begging for a Jackson
Pollock makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Now, white is making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The squeeze bottles are still around, but now, more often than
not, they serve a purely utilitarian function. They're great for
storing sauces, vinaigrettes, oils and vinegars. They come in handy
when a chef needs to direct a precise squirt of flavoring. And
pastry chefs are never going to release their grip. The squeeze
bottle is simply too efficient a writing instrument when it's time
to put a sweet signature on dessert. But the great fiesta of finger
painting, like the era of tall food, seems to be over.
</P>
<P>
   Its history is obscure, but it's always safe to blame anything
on nouvelle cuisine. When chefs began developing brightly colored
sauces based on previously unimaginable ingredients, it became
tempting to lay down a perfect puddle of vermilion, or kelly green,
on the discus-size plates that nouvelle favored. With a new,
broader palette, the door was open for a technological breakthrough
in applying the new colors.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for certain who first hit on the idea of the
squeeze bottle, but Jean-Jacques Rachou, the owner of La Cote
Basque, is happy to put himself forward as a candidate. ``I
invented it in 1975 or 1976, when we were starting to use the
lighter sauces,'' he said. Inspiration came after he made a beurre
blanc with saffron. The writing was on the wall. And then, almost
instantly, on the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Moonen, the executive chef at Oceana, said: ``I was
commissioned to buy the bottles. I'd go to the hair-dye section of
the drugstore and buy dozens of the tint and tone bottles.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, the painted plate appeared everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the early- to mid-'90s, people were just going crazy with
it,'' said Bobby Flay, a chef who painted with the best of them not
so many years ago, smitten after seeing his first squeeze bottle in
use at Cafe Annie in Houston about 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a piece of technology, it could not be beat. Previously, Flay
and his assistants stored their liquids in wine bottles and,
positioning a thumb over the mouth of the bottle, directed a more
or less steady stream of liquid over the plate. The squeeze bottle
brought instant precision to an imprecise art.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first discovered it, I was definitely taken by it,''
Flay said. ``It was like a new toy.'' Gradually, he worked through
his obsession. He uses the bottles, but not to decorate. ``When I
see sauces on a plate, it drives me nuts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The squeeze bottle lent itself to the vibrant colors of Nuevo
Latino and Southwestern cuisine, and to the precious ``small food,
big plate'' format favored by the newer restaurants. Colors and
designs that had been limited to the dessert menu suddenly invaded
the world of appetizers and main courses.
</P>
<P>
   Then, inevitably, the backlash came. Douglas Rodriguez, of
Chicama, well remembers his personal epiphany. ``I overheard a chef
referring to `squirt-bottle cuisine,''' he said. ``I've kept away
from it ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Other chefs have stuck with the squeeze bottle but adopted a
more chaste approach. Andrew DiCataldo, the executive chef at
Patria, likes to circle the plate with dots of diminishing size.
``We use them for herb oils when we really want to control the
amount of oil or sauce on the plate,'' he said. ``It gives you the
essence of the flavor and not a big, greasy slick.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonen still likes to brighten the plate with a dot or a blob,
but not with the sauces that he used back in the days of La Cote
Basque. He sticks to oils, or thickened pepper juices.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, color thrown out the door can come in through the
window. Rodriguez likes to add a touch of brightness with
microgreens, and a lot of chefs seem to be discovering the
eye-pleasing pleasures of brightly colored vegetables, which can be
sliced as finely as thread, deep fried and then piled in a
glorious, tousled toupee atop a main course.
</P>
<P>
   One alternative to liquid color is dry pigment, like a dusting
of cayenne pepper sprinkled with bits of chive or bell pepper.
Another is liquid whipped into a decorative froth.
</P>
<P>
   The squeeze bottle, meanwhile, seems to be wandering the
devolutionary road followed by all trends, which make their way to
the outer boroughs and farther afield, eventually arriving at
destinations like Toledo and Indianapolis. By that time, New York
may be ripe for a revisionist school.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there's always foam. We just need someone to
figure out how to get it into a spray gun.

AT&AMP;T REPORTS MIXED RESULTS AMID CONCERNS ABOUT GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T reported quarterly earnings Tuesday that modestly exceeded
analysts' expectations. But the company's revenue growth continued
to slow down amid deepening erosion in the core consumer
long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the complexity of AT&AMP;T, the nation's No. 1
long-distance carrier and No. 1 cable television provider, its
overall financial picture is relatively simple. While some of the
company's newer operations, including wireless, are performing
well, the shrinking of the consumer long-distance business makes it
tough for the company to show satisfactory growth.
</P>
<P>
   And in some ways that task is expected to become even tougher
through the end of 2001 because AT&AMP;T will lose the ability to use
its fast-growing wireless unit to buoy its overall financial
results. As AT&AMP;T distributes its remaining 84 percent stake in
separately traded AT&AMP;T Wireless Group to its own shareholders, the
parent company will stop consolidating the wireless unit's results
into its own.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, AT&AMP;T has been able to modestly exceed Wall
Street earnings projections, at least in part because of aggressive
cost-cutting. But that path will not be sustainable indefinitely.
At some point, earnings growth must emerge not from lower costs but
from the introduction of higher-profit services and, preferably,
from robust revenue growth. If the strategy that C. Michael
Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman, has mapped out for the company's future
is to succeed, the revenue growth will soon have to emerge in force
from AT&AMP;T's cable unit.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the company's depressed stock price appears to
be drawing it ever closer to creating additional spinoffs along the
lines of the new shares AT&AMP;T issued earlier this year to track the
wireless unit. In a conference call with analysts Tuesday,
Armstrong responded to a question about a possible spin-out of the
company's consumer long-distance business by mentioning some of the
positive effects such a move would have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enterprise share price doesn't represent the asset values
that we have,'' he said, ``nor the growth that we're scaling.''
Without the consumer unit, he said, AT&AMP;T could be seen as a $42
billion company growing at 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not that many enterprises of this size hanging around
that have that kind of growth and scaling as we go into 2001,''
Armstrong added.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T gained 68.75 cents Tuesday, to close at $34, in New York
Stock Exchange trading of nearly 35 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed somewhat encouraged that, excluding special
charges, the company earned $1.88 billion, or 57 cents a share, in
the second quarter. That was more than 16 percent higher than
earnings of 49 cents a share in the corresponding period a year
earlier and 4 cents higher than the consensus estimate by analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Charles H. Noski, AT&AMP;T's chief financial officer, predicted that
earnings in the current quarter, excluding special charges, would
be 40 to 43 cents, higher than the 37 cent estimate of First Call
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the numbers, the second-quarter did not reflect any
gangbusters operational performance. In an interview, Noski said
that about 2 cents of the second-quarter earnings were a result of
higher interest income on AT&AMP;T's cash investments. Some analysts
also gave some credit to the company's success in trying to
eliminate $2 billion in costs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the second quarter, AT&AMP;T showed its worst quarterly
revenue growth in almost two years. Adjusting for the impact of the
acquisitions of the MediaOne Group and IBM's Global Network
operation, the company had pro forma revenue growth of 4.5 percent,
to $16.9 billion. In the second quarter of 1999, pro forma revenue
growth was 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit last quarter was, as usual, the consumer
long-distance unit, whose sales shrank more than 7 percent, to $5
billion from $5.4 billion in the 1999 period. In quarters past,
AT&AMP;T's unit serving business customers could be counted on to pick
up the slack, but that unit stumbled earlier this year as it tried
to transfer some big corporate customers to Concert, AT&AMP;T's joint
venture with British Telecommunications. In the second quarter, the
business-services unit posted growth of only 4 percent, to $6.9
billion, and the company said yesterday that the unit would grow
only 6 percent this year rather than the roughly 8 percent it had
sought.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's cable unit grew a strong 10.5 percent, to $2.4 billion in
revenue during the quarter. To meet its targets, AT&AMP;T must deploy
local phone service over cable lines to at least 300,000 additional
homes in areas previously served by Tele-Communications Inc. by the
end of the year. Including areas previously served by MediaOne,
however, the company is already delivering such service to a
quarter-million homes across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Including all special charges, AT&AMP;T reported earnings of $1.75
billion, or 53 cents a share, for the quarter, up from $1.59
billion, or 49 cents, during the second quarter of 1999. AT&AMP;T
formally reported revenue of $16.22 billion, up from $15.75 billion
during the second quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Wireless reported impressive results Tuesday. Revenue
increased almost 32 percent from the second quarter of 1999, to
$2.5 billion from $1.9 billion. Earnings more than doubled to $200
million from $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T Wireless Group rose $2.3125 Tuesday, to $29.375, in
trading of 12.6 million shares. The stock was offered to the public
in April at $29.50 a share.

&HT;     CHENEY: DADDY'S BOY LOOKS BACKWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's selection of a veteran
of his father's Cabinet as his running mate indicates that the son
wants to run another cautious, status-quo administration just like
dear old dad's.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate question is: What does 59-year-old former
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, out of the public eye for a
decade, bring to the Republican presidential ticket?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: a calming influence on those skeptics who simply don't
believe the junior Bush is intellectually up to the challenges of
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But is Cheney's experience, friendship with daddy and political
stature enough to get the ticket to the White House? Not by itself.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a better move than picking a coltish, doltish young man
in hopes of creating a glamour quotient, as papa Bush did when he
foolishly made Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana his 1988 choice for veep.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Republicans are fielding daddy's boy, propped up
by daddy's man. It's up to the candidate himself to provide the
glamour and the running mate to provide the substance.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has a formidable reputation within the Republican
establishment for integrity, wisdom and fairness. If you like
conservatives, this is, as Bush said, ``a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   But his mere selection is a public admission that Bush needs all
the help he can get and that he will look to the past, not the
future, for it. His father's influence, mostly hidden until now,
suddenly looms over the scene like that giant spider sculpture in
the doorway of the new Tate Gallery in London.
</P>
<P>
   Are we being asked to vote on a candidate who is his own man or
one who needs a babysitter, or many babysitters?
</P>
<P>
   Does the country really pant for a repeat of his father's
administration, which voters rejected in 1992 for that rascal Bill
Clinton? Think recession. Think goofy remarks. Think boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Texas governor has been trying to project the
fresh face of change, reflecting new directions and a revitalized
moral tone for the nation. He describes himself as an ``outsider,''
someone who would reject ``old-style Washington politics,'' in
contrast to that ultimate insider, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This line was always political hokum, coming from the son of a
former president, but Cheney's presence unmistakably strips away
the final shreds of that pretense. In addition to his
identification with the GOP old guard, Cheney had a voting record
as a Wyoming congressman that rigidly followed party doctrine _
anti-gun control, anti-abortion and anti-environment.
</P>
<P>
   Whether out of self-confidence or lack of it, Bush is not
embarrassed to defer to senior Republicans when he is on unfamiliar
policy terrain.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he disclosed his strategic nuclear reduction plan
_ a subject on which he has about as much expertise as I do _ while
surrounding himself with big-name Republican props. On the stage
with him were his father's national security adviser, Brent
Scowcroft; his father's chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Colin Powell; President Ronald Reagan's secretary of state, George
Shultz, and President Richard Nixon's secretary of state Henry
Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   It was an old boys' club with a younger guy looking out of place
in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   We are getting here the image of a candidate who sees being
president as akin to being chairman of the board, relying on a
loyal team to do the real homework and the real thinking. The idea
is to go about a hard-line conservative agenda without being
harshly offensive and partisan about it.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is a team player who fits that mold. He does not offer
inflammatory, damaging sound bites. He is not a Patrick Buchanan,
constantly insulting those who dare disagree with him.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, so the new pair would work well together in the White
House. But first the Bush-Cheney ticket has to win an election. And
Cheney is not a great campaigner or a great speaker. His low-key
style reminds me of Washington Sen. Henry (Scoop) Jackson, a
much-admired heavy lifter who was the frontrunner for the 1972
Democratic nomination until voters discovered he had a mouth full
of mush.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney briefly flirted with a presidential campaign in 1996 and
found he neither liked the work nor persuaded voters to like him.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in fact, much like Jack Kemp, a popular Republican
insider who proved to be a dud as Bob Dole's 1996 running mate
because he had no instinct for the jugular and no passion for his
role. He might not have been a bad president, though.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush had wanted an exciting ticket, he would have picked his
primary rival, Sen. John McCain. It would have been stronger than
Bush-Cheney. But Bush did not want to take a risk on a man he did
not trust.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bush is to be credited with picking a running mate
qualified to assume the presidency himself if required. If Gore
does the same, as I think he will, we may finally have settled into
a political pattern in which we take the vice presidency seriously.
Hooray.

&HT;     BUSH PUTS PREMIUM ON LOYALTY IN PICKING CHENEY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     A News Analysis   
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his selection of Dick Cheney as his running
mate Tuesday, Republican George W. Bush underscored the premium
that the Bush family places on personal loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor set aside the traditional political calculus
of electoral punch, campaign pizzazz and diversity to select a man
whose reputation for loyalty and discretion was unblemished during
the 14 months he served as White House chief of staff to President
Gerald Ford in the 1970s and as secretary of defense in the Bush
administration through the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush said he decided to choose Cheney after working closely
with him the former Wyoming congressman since April on the
politically sensitive task of identifying prospective vice
presidential running mates and thoroughly checking their
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gradually I realized that the person who was best qualified to
be my vice presidential nominee was working by my side,'' Bush told
a boisterous rally in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cited Cheney's ``outstanding judgment,'' his ``keen
insight'' and ``the thoughtful and thorough way he approached his
mission'' of screening prospective running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's personnel selections during two terms as governor of
Texas have been long on the loyalty trait and many of his closest
aides _ disparagingly called ``the Austin Mafia'' _ have been with
him since he took office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A Yale college classmate, Clay Johnson, serves as Bush's chief
of staff. A long time chum from his days as a West Texas oil
entrepreneur, Don Evans, serves as Bush's national campaign
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Black, a Washington, D.C. political consultant who has
advised the presidential campaigns of both the Bushes, said Cheney
has proven to both father and son that he can keep confidences,
offer candid advice and serve as a loyal subordinate, no matter
what the outcome of a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney demonstrated as defense secretary that ``if the president
sets the policy, he'll carry it out,'' Black said. ``Whatever Gov.
Bush wants to do in the way of policy, Vice President Cheney will
do an excellent job of following the president's lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings
Institution who served four presidents in the White House, said the
Bush family has long emphasized loyalty as an iron-clad constant in
the tumultuous upheavals of state and national politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of family and the sense of loyalty go very deep
here,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush learned the value of personal loyalty while watching
his father fight his way to national prominence through the
hard-bitten politics of Texas in the 1960s when Republicans were so
scarce that mutual loyalty was essential for political survival in
the largely Democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush, who fought former California Gov. Ronald Reagan
for the GOP nomination in 1980 and lost, joined the Reagan-led
ticket that won the White House twice in the 1980s. Bush, as vice
president, won and cherished his reputation for loyalty to Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   When Vice President Bush fought off rivals for the GOP
nomination in 1988 and it came time to choose his own running mate,
he waved aside more prominent or politically experienced
prospective running mates to choose a running mate who could be
counted upon to be loyal.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush passed on nationally known politicians such as
Sens. Bob Dole, R-Kan., Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and Pete Domenici,
R-N.M. to choose Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., then a 41-year-old ``Baby
Boomer'' politician who had not been tested in national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, a prospective running mate at the time, said that
Bush's choice had come in large part from his eight years as vice
president under Reagan ``when his L-word has been 'loyalty' [to
Reagan].''
</P>
<P>
   The president's son _ now the governor of Texas _ served as
loyalty enforcer for his father during the 1988 transition, making
sure that Bush loyalists won key positions in the holdover
Reagan-Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush also intervened toward the end of the Bush
presidency to help sack chief of staff John Sununu when political
backbiting had flared between the White House and the Bush
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Bush remained true to friends, even at a political
price. He named a longtime Texas ally, then-Sen. John Tower,
R-Texas, as his nominee for defense secretary after taking office
in 1989. But the nomination backfired in the face of senators'
antipathy to Tower's high-handed leadership of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Senate rejection of Tower's nomination cleared the way for
President Bush to choose Cheney, then the popular minority House
whip, who quickly won Senate confirmation as defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush's renowned emphasis on loyalty made him known as
a politician who often seemed ``long on friends and short on
ideology,'' Hess recalled. ``That was both a strength and a
weakness.''

<HEADLINE>
EARNINGS WILL DROP SHARPLY, KMART WARNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich.)   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven weeks after Charles C. Conaway took over as chairman and
chief executive of Kmart Corp., the company announced that it would
take a $740 pretax charge for inventory clearance and store
closings and indicated that a substantial investment in technology
would be key to future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart also warned Tuesday that excluding this write-off, second
quarter earnings would miss expectations by a mile. Actual second
quarter results will be announced Aug 10. The company is also
expected to announce major management changes in the next several
days.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer, based just outside Detroit in Troy, has struggled
against its highly competitive discount rivals Wal-Mart Stores and
Target Inc., but bad news reported Tuesday indicated problems that
ran even deeper than previously revealed. For example, Kmart said
it now expected second-quarter earnings from operations to be in
the range of 4 cents to 7 cents a share, down from 26 cents a share
for the quarter a year ago. That is 75 percent less than the
analyst consensus estimate of 16 cents a share, as tabulated by
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   A $290 million charge for inventory reduction throughout the
chain also puts a new light on the tenure of Floyd Hall, Kmart's
previous chief executive. Until the first quarter of this year,
Hall was able to boast of 12 straight quarters of earnings growth,
but apparently that did not fully reflect a great deal of
merchandise that in fact had been piling up and would eventually
have to be disposed of as a loss.
</P>
<P>
   In another potentially worrisome sign, the retailer said of the
72 stores it expected to close, six were the Super K format. Kmart
had said previously that the Super K format stores, which are extra
large and sell groceries as well as apparel, were key to future
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Conway denied that the closing signaled a change in this
particular aspect of Kmart's strategy. ``Not all Super K's are
painted equal, '' he said. ``These are older stores that are not
even close to our vision for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   As stores close, the company said, about 5,000 jobs, accounting
for almost 2 percent of its 278,000 employees, will be eliminated.
Some of those affected may find jobs at other Kmart stores, the
company said. Kmart will take a pretax charge of $300 million for
the closings, plus pretax charges of $75 million to write off the
inventory in the closed stores.
</P>
<P>
   The new chief executive said his basic focus was to force Kmart
to demand a ``higher return on all its assets'' from real estate to
inventory. As a result he said the company was closing stores that
were profitable, but not profitable enough.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street appeared nonplussed by the changes. Kmart stock,
which has been battered for weeks now and is down from a high of
$10 in March and a 52-week high of $16 a share, was down again. It
lost $.1875 a share in trading Tuesday to close at $6.875. ``This
provides him a cleaner stage,'' said Richard L. Church, a stock
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``But they've been
unsuccessfully getting a return on investor capital for a long
time. ''
</P>
<P>
   Conaway, who moved from his role as president of CVS and took
the helm of Kmart on June 1, has yet to articulate the full details
of his vision to make Kmart more competitive, but in its early
outlines it appears to rely heavily on technology. The company has
said it will spend a total of $460 million to upgrade its
information systems.
</P>
<P>
   Major initiatives under way, the company said, are the
installations of new scanners in all stores, new registers in the
company's 300 highest volume stores, and new systems to help
Kmart's merchants monitor and manage inventory. The company will
also take a $75 million charge for replacing outmoded computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   It also expects to spend $210 million to improve its
distribution and logistics network.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and with analysts he has given some hint of how he
hopes this technology will make Kmart's sales perk up. ``He is
aghast that he deals with technology that is 10 years old when his
competitors have technology that is two years old,'' said Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard Retail Trend Report. ``He wants to
create a system where every buyer is completely informed every
moment on how the purchases are doing and then really hold their
feet to the fire.''.
</P>
<P>
   Conaway added that the systems would also dictate all sorts of
decisions made by human managers, like when to mark down
merchandise. For example, he said, this spring after two weeks of
unusually cool weather hurt sales, store buyers chose to wait to
mark down a lot of apparel items, and they eventually had to take
bigger cuts to match competitors. A new computer system, he said,
would have demanded that the markdowns be made earlier and would
have reduced the total markdown that was needed to move the
product.
</P>
<P>
   But stock analyst remain skeptical that technology will solve
the retailer's biggest problems, not least of all because Kmart's
competitors are already so far ahead in this area. ``Look you can
buy technology,'' said George Strachan, an analyst with Goldman
Sachs, ``but you also have to infuse the culture with how to use
technology, how to read the data. Besides, it is hard for me to
imagine any company leap-frogging Wal-Mart.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Richard J. Callahan started his career
stringing telephone lines in South Dakota in the 1960s. Now he is
stringing together cable television systems in Europe, and he may
soon be one of its biggest operators.
</P>
<P>
   To the astonishment if not anger of many rivals, Callahan
recently outmaneuvered a number of European companies in acquiring
one big cable television system from Deutsche Telekom, Germany's
biggest telecommunications company. He is well on his way to
acquiring a second system from Telekom, the former government
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan's venture is a local sideshow to Deutsche Telekom's far
more prominent effort to buy VoiceStream, a cellular telephone
company in the United States. But it offers an important glimpse
into what some see as Deutsche Telekom's efforts to insulate itself
from competition at home, even as it seeks to expand abroad.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, Callahan and his partners will
serve about one-third of Germany's 17 million cable customers by
the end of this year. And like a number of other cable operators,
Callahan has big plans for upgrading his systems to offer telephone
service, high-speed access to the Internet and interactive
television.
</P>
<P>
   But looming over all these plans is the giant shadow of Deutsche
Telekom itself. The upgraded systems would compete directly with
Deutsche Telekom, which has insisted on keeping a 45 percent stake
in each cable system. Indeed, other aspiring bidders complain the
German company went out of its way to make sure the cable systems
would be too fragmented to pose a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   Some go further, arguing that Deutsche Telekom intentionally
picked buyers who would be the least likely to cause it competitive
heartburn. When Deutsche Telekom announced plans to sell its cable
systems two years ago, more than 35 companies expressed interest.
Today, all but a handful of those companies have either dropped out
or have been deemed unqualified by Deutsche Telekom executives.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only people who have actually bought a system so far
are Callahan and a secretive American financier named Gary A.
Klesch. Even more striking, executives on all sides say that
Deutsche Telekom selected Callahan's bid even though it was lower
than one from the investment arm of Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear that Deutsche Telekom wanted to keep as much
control of these systems as it could,'' said Paul Thomassen, chief
financial officer of Primacom, Germany's fourth-largest cable
operator, whose bids were also rejected.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Callahan declined to be interviewed, saying that the company had
just completed a bond offering and was prohibited by U.S.
securities laws from making public statements.
</P>
<P>
   But Callahan has been quite public about his plans. As head of
international ventures from 1984 to 1996 for U S West, the regional
Bell telephone company, he helped launch Telewest, the British
cable company that was one of the world's first to offer telephone
and cable television over the same system.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   backed by investors like the Blackstone Group and GE Capital,
Callahan Associates International is already building advanced
cable systems in Spain and France and has raised nearly $8 billion
to pay for its German venture.
</P>
<P>
   Under orders from antitrust regulators at the European
Commission, who wanted to see cable systems competing with
telephone carriers, Deutsche Telekom agreed to spin off its cable
properties two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, Callahan's group paid about $3.5 billion
for a controlling stake in Deutsche Telekom's cable network in
North-Rhine Westphalia. Now he is in exclusive negotiations to buy
a second German system for nearly $2 billion, which would give him
control of about one-third of the German cable television market.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, however, Deutsche Telekom executives have
made it clear they are worried about somebody transforming the
cable systems into a nationwide rival of the phone company.
</P>
<P>
   To block potential buyers from establishing a nationwide
network, the German telephone giant divided its national network
into nine regions. It also insisted on retaining a 45 percent stake
in each of the systems, which is enough under German law to veto
mergers and perhaps capital increases as well.
</P>
<P>
   The most startling aspect of the process is the way buyers have
been selected. Executives on all sides of the auction say that
Callahan's bid for the North Rhine system was significantly lower
than an offer from Deutsche Bank's investment arm, DB Investor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Deutsche Telekom executives flatly rejected DB Investor's
bid. ``They basically told us they didn't want us to have those
systems, because it would make us too big,'' said one person close
to DB Investor, which had outlined plans to stitch together a
nationwide network.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich Lissek, a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom, insisted that
his company had no intention of blocking competition or influencing
the cable systems. But he acknowledged that the company had not
necessarily picked buyers who offered the highest price.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it is not interesting just to get the best price,''
Lissek said. ``The best price says nothing about the future of the
company, nothing about the targets of the owner and nothing about
the future of the employees.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Those arguments are believable when applied to Callahan. But
they strain credibility when applied to the other big winner in the
cable auctions, Klesch.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Callahan, Klesch has no experience in running cable
television systems or any other kind of communications business. As
founder of Klesch &AMP; Co. in London, he spent much of the last decade
investing in the securities of financially troubled European
ventures like the Channel Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Klesch's lack of experience, Telekom executives selected
him to buy a system that serves more than 1 million subscribers in
Hesse, the prosperous state that includes Frankfurt. As soon as
that deal closed, the company picked Klesch to enter exclusive
negotiations for two other systems in Lower Saxony and in eastern
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Klesch remains a mystery to most people in the industry and
refused to return numerous calls requesting an interview. He
appears to operate out of a small office in London with a handful
of employees. He has been secretive about his sources of financing,
but a prospectus for a new junk-bond offering earlier this month
disclosed that he recently sold a 35 percent stake in his German
venture to NTL Communications, which owns cable systems in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, by contrast, has been comparatively open. His company
has raised nearly $5 billion for its German efforts, including $1
billion from the Blackstone Group and other investors; more than $3
billion in senior debt and about $750 million in high-yield junk
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Klesch, Callahan has also recruited a high-powered team
of executives. Last month, he persuaded Andrew Sukawaty, the chief
executive of Sprint Corp.'s nationwide wireless telephone network,
to become president of Callahan Associates. William Barker, who had
previously headed a unit of GE Capital devoted to investments in
telecommunications, is one of Callahan's lead scouts for deals.
Many other executives are veterans from U S West International and
were involved in introducing Telewest and the One-2-One mobile
telephone network in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   None of that erases the question of whether Deutsche Telekom
will allow Callahan to operate freely in Germany. One of Telekom's
hottest businesses is providing Internet access, and it is
aggressively marketing high-speed lines known as digital subscriber
loops.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, along with many other cable operators, plans to
compete head-to-head in those fields by upgrading the traditional
systems with fiber optics and two-way communications.
</P>
<P>
   Telekom executives made it clear more than a year ago that they
were worried about overly aggressive competitors. People close to
Telekom say one reason they were hostile to Deutsche Bank was that
they suspected it was acting as a front for Mannesmann, its
archrival in both wireless and hard-wired telephone services.
Mannesmann had wanted to bid on several cable properties, but was
turned down flat.
</P>
<P>
   Telekom executives had originally proposed selling only minority
stakes in its cable systems, but that idea was rejected by
antitrust regulators. But in retaining 45 percent of each system,
the telephone company can block mergers and other major corporate
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers are almost certain to be of critical importance, because
Callahan needs more scale in Germany and it also needs to acquire a
number of companies that actually own the wires into customers'
homes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Callahan executives say they negotiated legal agreements under
which Telekom agreed not to invoke its veto rights on questions
about capital increases. According to its bond prospectus, Telekom
also agreed not to veto most acquisitions within the cable system's
own region.
</P>
<P>
   But Deutsche Telekom did not agree to accept mergers with
neighboring cable operators automatically. That is potentially
important, because Callahan officials are already looking for other
networks to buy and link with their existing properties.
</P>
<P>
   Lissek, Telekom's spokesman, said his company simply wanted to
protect itself. ``If we go under 25 percent, the majority
shareholders can make a capital increase or a merger without our
agreement, and suddenly we are completely minority shareholders,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As if those restrictions were not enough, many industry
executives note that Deutsche Telekom will retain control over 10
channels _ expandable to 80 channels, if signals are transmitted
with digital technology _ that will be used to fulfill long-term
contracts between Deutsche Telekom and the Munich-based Kirch
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Telekom and Kirch have formed their own joint venture, called
MSG, which will transmit programming and has developed its own
system of encryption and billing. Though obscure, the demands to
accommodate Kirch and MSG worry outside programmers as well as
cable operators like Thomassen of Primacom.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan executives say they are not worried, but admit that
they will have to build additional capacity into the systems before
they can embark on their plans for offering full broadband services
to customers. That means heavy upfront expense with little initial
increase in revenue. Nobody is predicting profits for the next
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said one Callahan executive, ``is a long-term
position.''

to have worked in some states between 1990 and 1996, according to a
massive RAND Corp. report to be released here Tuesday. Comparing
NAEP achievement scores by students from similar families from 44
states, the researchers found that fast-improving states like North
Carolina and Texas had smaller classes in the early grades, more
kids in public pre-kindergarten programs and a higher number of
teachers who said they had adequate resources than was true in
states like Georgia, where scores stagnated, or California, where
scores plunged in those years. Some other plausible explanations _
such as higher scores by students whose teachers had masters
degrees or higher salaries _ didn't pan out. But, years after the
fact, it now appears that the post-1996 decisions by policy-makers
to stress pre-k classes in Georgia and to lower class size in
grades 1 to 3 in California were smart moves. (Mollison, Cox News

A MATCHUP MADE IN GOP HEAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By selecting former Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney as his
running mate, Governor George W. Bush Tuesday filled out the
Republican ticket _ and rounded out the GOP's own profile as it
heads toward the midsummer convention.
</P>
<P>
   In every respect _ in temperament, in background, in age, and
and outlook _ the running mate complements the candidate. It is a
classic matching of attributes. But in making the seemingly
risk-free decision to select a respected and seasoned party elder,
Bush may have taken the biggest risk of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Where Bush is an outsider, Cheney is an insider. Where Bush is
inexperienced, Cheney is tested. Where Bush is a blank page, Cheney
is reams of agate type on pages of the Congressional Record. Where
Bush came of age politically in the 1990s, Cheney came of age in
the 1970s. Where Bush leans to the middle, Cheney leans to the
right.
</P>
<P>
   They are, moreover, so compatible a team precisely because they
are so different.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is easy-going, Cheney is deliberative. Bush was unmarked by
the tensions of his time, Cheney is branded by them. Bush is
intuitive, Cheney is introspective.
</P>
<P>
   The governor calculated that the addition of a battle-tested
veteran of wars political, idological and military would complement
the profile of a candidate whose experience in elected office is
less than six years long. He sought, and found, a running mate who
offered comfort to the candidate and presumably will do the same to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the selection of a onetime White House chief of
staff, House Republican leader and civilian commander of the
military was hailed by Republicans as the perfect match for the
party and, they hope, for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is, above all, steady. There will be no anxious moments
in debates, no stumbles on the campaign trail, no gaffes in
televised interviews. There will be no asides about ``Democrat
wars,'' as Senator Robert J. Dole made as the GOP's 1976
vice-presidential nominee, no moments of terror to compare with the
frightened look in Senator Dan Quayle's eyes during the 1988 debate
with Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But in the uncertainties of American politics in the new
century, there is no assurance that a risk-free choice makes for a
risk-free strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to avoid the error his father made in selecting an
unseasoned runningmate, Bush may be suggesting that he is fighting
the last campaign or, more specifically, the 1988 and 1992
campaigns. In seeking to install a mature figure at his side _ the
phrase that bounced around political circles in the wake of
Cheney's selection was that the man from Wyoming was an ``adult'' _
Bush may be risking the conclusion that the man who wants to lead
the country himself is in need of a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the selection of a running mate who is so
experienced, so safe and so familiar runs the risk of undercutting
the campaign's effort to position itself as an agent of excitement,
experimentation and change.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, however, Bush has hired a man who knows
Washington, knows the government, knows the White House, knows the
business world and knows his own mind. The danger _ and this the
Bush campaign understands_ is that Cheney's own mastery of all
those areas may exceed the governors.
</P>
<P>
   That said, leadership is an intangible quality, resistant to
definition. Bush will formally receive the Republican nomination
next week because of a bundle of intangibles: his personality, his
ability to set others at ease, his insight that the party would
embrace a conservatism-in-a-velvet-glove, his impulse to reach out,
not only to Democrats but also to the minorities and the striving
who through much of the last century found the Republican Party
inhospitible.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is a master of the levers of government. Bush is a master
of the reflexes of the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   His choice of Cheney is the modern affirmation of one of the
principles of Richard M. Nixon, who twice ran for vice president
and four times selected a vice president. Nixon's maxim was simple:
Be assured that your number two does no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney will do no harm. And it may not matter if he does no
good.
</P>
<P>
   This month the CBS News poll surveyed American adults and asked
them whether they had ever changed their minds or voted for a
different presidential candidate because of the identity of the
vice-presidential contender. Only one in 11 said they had. And
eight out of nine said they had not.
</P>
<P>
   But the very process of selecting a vice president _ of making a
high-level, high-profile, high-stakes appointment in the middle of
a presidential campaign _ shapes more than a ticket. It shapes how
a presidential candidate is viewed. Bush has made a choice, not
about a runningmate but about himself.

LESSONS COLUMN: FINDING THE `HOT SCHOOL' FOR YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last fall, convinced that it could attract more students if it
could just show them what happens in the classroom, Mount Holyoke
College tried out a new marketing strategy: it sent professors to
three cities to teach hourlong lectures, much like what they would
teach back on campus, to prospective applicants.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when colleges wrangle over who ranks highest on the
``most wired'' list, it seemed like such a quaint idea, almost
naive: lure 'em with good teaching.
</P>
<P>
   But it hooked me. I walked away from the biology lecture
wondering not only why, when I looked at colleges in the 1980's, I
hadn't considered a women's college, but also why I had not thought
more seriously _ that is to say, at all _ about studying science.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Because I did like so many other people did, and do:
with the wisdom typical of age 16, I chose the ``hot'' school _ so
hot that it was pictured on the cover of The New York Times
Magazine with the headline ``The Hot School,'' so hot that it
didn't accept me, leaving me to scramble for an alternative that
worked out, but far from ideally.
</P>
<P>
   Just punishment, then, that I should be assigned to cover
education, a job that means I find myself at least once a week
asking why I didn't consider this college or that, depending on
whatever program I've just visited, whatever professor or college
president I've just interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The point is not so much that I should have studied medicine or
gone to Mount Holyoke (though I did discover that one dowager left
a chunk of her fortune to ensuring the nightly tradition of milk
and cookies in the dorms, which I found pretty appealing). The
point is that like so many prospective college students, I never
thought outside the ``hot'' box.
</P>
<P>
   Hot has only gotten hotter since I set my sights on Duke, in
vain. There are more than 3,000 colleges in the United States. Yet
the ``Harvard or bust'' mentality has grown so frenzied that
excellent colleges complain that they have to give more financial
aid based on merit and less based on need because the only way they
can attract good students away from the big names is to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   I can't help but wonder whether if everyone did for a living
what I now do _ or at least the parents and students out touring
colleges this summer _ people might be less obsessed with the hot
school and more interested in what schools work best for them.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing they'd realize is how many interesting things
are happening at so many different colleges. How about a place
where the college president still teaches class, engagingly so? A
place where alumni barons of the new economy come back to lecture
in small seminars about what they've learned? A place with strong
mentoring? A place that demands that students learn to write and
speak well, whether they major in engineering or English? A state
college that affords you the opportunity to take courses as well at
the most exclusive liberal arts college in the nation, while paying
less than $10,000 a year? These are all things happening at good
colleges whose names aren't among the five or so hot schools that
every student in the country seems to want to attend.
</P>
<P>
   They might also see that hot is a pretty empty concept, based
mostly on rankings that in themselves are fairly arbitrary. The
most popular guides devise rankings based on the number of alumni
donations, the number of students per faculty member, the number of
applications rejected. Some schools have explicitly said they shape
their budgets to make themselves look better in rankings. Others
assemble teams of staff specifically to figure out how to list
information in a way that will lift the ranking; they can dance on
the head of a pin to find the most flattering definition of
``faculty'' or ``alumni.'' Which is better, a school that's figured
out how to ace the rankings, or one that serves students well?
</P>
<P>
   If I were going to do it all over again, knowing what I have
learned from colleges across the country, I would consider the
larger state schools, and smaller strong liberal arts colleges in
the Midwest. I would sit in on classes, and not just English
classes, but physics classes, too. As that lecture last fall taught
me, a professor's ability to intrigue the uninitiate is a pretty
good indication of how dedicated a college is to teaching.
</P>
<P>
   I would remember that college is about exploring your options,
and look for a place strongly encouraging that. I would remember,
too, that college is what you make of it, no matter where you are.
</P>
<P>
   It's become easy to say that professors at research universities
don't do enough teaching. That, too, isn't always true; I've met
plenty of professors and deans at Harvard who care about individual
students. But these aren't the schools for everyone. The trick, as
guidance counselors try to convince their students every year,
isn't to get into the best college. It's to find the best college
for you.

DOCTORS SEE NO HEALTH PROBLEMS FOR CHENEY

<P>
   Dick Cheney suffered his first heart attack at 37, during his
first campaign for Wyoming's House of Representatives seat in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years in Congress brought two more heart attacks and, in
1988, quadruple bypass surgery. But Cheney also quit smoking,
started exercising and, his doctors say, avoided further troubles
through a series of high-pressure jobs that included directing the
Gulf War as Secretary of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he was on the treadmill Tuesday morning at 6:22, when
George W. Bush called to make him his running mate, said Bush
communications director Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Independent cardiologists declined to outline a specific
prognosis for Cheney, 59, without knowing the details of his
medical history. But they said Tuesday that if his cholesterol
levels and stress-test results are good and he has no symptoms of
continued heart disease, he has a good chance of staying healthy
during a four-year stint as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   For someone of Cheney's age without symptoms, ``the odds are
very low, maybe one to three percent, that they will get into any
significant trouble in a given year,'' said Ira S. Ockene, director
of preventive cardiology at the UMass Memorial Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Noted Houston heart specialist Denton Cooley gave Cheney the
green light after speaking at Bush's request with Cheney's
cardiologist, Jonathan Reiner of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Cheney's health problems in the past should not interfere
with a strenuous political campaign,'' Cooley said in a prepared
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Some voiced concern anyway. ``I don't understand how a man who
had three heart attacks gets to be a heartbeat away from the
presidency,'' said pollster John Zogby.
</P>
<P>
   Others note that the vice presidency _ sometimes the butt of
jokes for its often-ceremonial role _ is hardly more stressful than
the other jobs Cheney has held since his surgery. He is currently
the chief executive officer of Halliburton Corp., an energy company
based in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   And stress is a relative thing, doctors say. Deeb Salem,
chairman of medicine at New England Medical Center and former
president of the American Heart Association's New England
affiliate, said intense jobs are not inherently a health risk,
especially for those who thrive on pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Ockene agreed, saying underlying factors such as cholesterol
level, tobacco use and the strength of the heart muscle are most
important in determining whether stress will trigger a heart
attack. Otherwise, he said, ``there'd be a lot more (heart attacks)
in Rwanda than here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney takes cholesterol-lowering medication, according to
Hughes, who said the Bush campaign is debating whether to release
more details on his long list of medications.
</P>
<P>
   This year 1.1 million American will have a new or recurrent
coronary attack, and more than 40 percent will die as a result, the
American Heart Association estimates. On the other hand, with
increasingly effective preventive measures, people have a better
chance of a long life if they survive the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Heart attacks often result from fat and cholesterol blocking the
arteries that carry blood to the heart muscle. In a bypass
operation, doctors use an artery or vein from the patient's own
body to construct a detour around the blocked part of the artery.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years after Cheney's operation, Deeb said, the key
questions are ``plumbing issues'': Has the bypass developed a
blockage, or have new blockages developed in other areas?
</P>
<P>
   There are three indicators of potential problems, he said:
</P>
<P>
   --Does he have symptoms such as chest pains?
</P>
<P>
   --How strong is his heart? Normally, the heart squeezes 50
percent of the blood in it with each beat. Heart attacks can damage
the muscle and decrease that percentage.
</P>
<P>
   --How did he do on his last stress test? In this procedure, a
radioactive substance is injected into the blood and tracked while
the patient runs on a treadmill to see whether enough blood flows
to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he flunked all three of those, I'd say the chance of him
having a bad event in the next four years is pretty high,'' Deeb
said. But if all three indicators look good, he said, those chances
are dramatically reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have long debated whether the public has a right to
know such details, but they are legitimate questions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other health concerns in Cheney's life have included the removal
of a skin cancer, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   And, she added, he is allergic to pomegranates.

EARNINGS WILL DROP SHARPLY, KMART WARNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich.)   (SUBS to clarify figure in 1st graf; $740 million is correct,
adding word million) 
By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven weeks after Charles C. Conaway took over as chairman and
chief executive of Kmart Corp., the company announced that it would
take a $740 million pretax charge for inventory clearance and store
closings and indicated that a substantial investment in technology
would be key to future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart also warned Tuesday that excluding this write-off, second
quarter earnings would miss expectations by a mile. Actual second
quarter results will be announced Aug 10. The company is also
expected to announce major management changes in the next several
days.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer, based just outside Detroit in Troy, has struggled
against its highly competitive discount rivals Wal-Mart Stores and
Target Inc., but bad news reported Tuesday indicated problems that
ran even deeper than previously revealed. For example, Kmart said
it now expected second-quarter earnings from operations to be in
the range of 4 cents to 7 cents a share, down from 26 cents a share
for the quarter a year ago. That is 75 percent less than the
analyst consensus estimate of 16 cents a share, as tabulated by
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   A $290 million charge for inventory reduction throughout the
chain also puts a new light on the tenure of Floyd Hall, Kmart's
previous chief executive. Until the first quarter of this year,
Hall was able to boast of 12 straight quarters of earnings growth,
but apparently that did not fully reflect a great deal of
merchandise that in fact had been piling up and would eventually
have to be disposed of as a loss.
</P>
<P>
   In another potentially worrisome sign, the retailer said of the
72 stores it expected to close, six were the Super K format. Kmart
had said previously that the Super K format stores, which are extra
large and sell groceries as well as apparel, were key to future
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Conway denied that the closing signaled a change in this
particular aspect of Kmart's strategy. ``Not all Super K's are
painted equal, '' he said. ``These are older stores that are not
even close to our vision for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   As stores close, the company said, about 5,000 jobs, accounting
for almost 2 percent of its 278,000 employees, will be eliminated.
Some of those affected may find jobs at other Kmart stores, the
company said. Kmart will take a pretax charge of $300 million for
the closings, plus pretax charges of $75 million to write off the
inventory in the closed stores.
</P>
<P>
   The new chief executive said his basic focus was to force Kmart
to demand a ``higher return on all its assets'' from real estate to
inventory. As a result he said the company was closing stores that
were profitable, but not profitable enough.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street appeared nonplussed by the changes. Kmart stock,
which has been battered for weeks now and is down from a high of
$10 in March and a 52-week high of $16 a share, was down again. It
lost $.1875 a share in trading Tuesday to close at $6.875. ``This
provides him a cleaner stage,'' said Richard L. Church, a stock
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``But they've been
unsuccessfully getting a return on investor capital for a long
time. ''
</P>
<P>
   Conaway, who moved from his role as president of CVS and took
the helm of Kmart on June 1, has yet to articulate the full details
of his vision to make Kmart more competitive, but in its early
outlines it appears to rely heavily on technology. The company has
said it will spend a total of $460 million to upgrade its
information systems.
</P>
<P>
   Major initiatives under way, the company said, are the
installations of new scanners in all stores, new registers in the
company's 300 highest volume stores, and new systems to help
Kmart's merchants monitor and manage inventory. The company will
also take a $75 million charge for replacing outmoded computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   It also expects to spend $210 million to improve its
distribution and logistics network.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and with analysts he has given some hint of how he
hopes this technology will make Kmart's sales perk up. ``He is
aghast that he deals with technology that is 10 years old when his
competitors have technology that is two years old,'' said Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard Retail Trend Report. ``He wants to
create a system where every buyer is completely informed every
moment on how the purchases are doing and then really hold their
feet to the fire.''.
</P>
<P>
   Conaway added that the systems would also dictate all sorts of
decisions made by human managers, like when to mark down
merchandise. For example, he said, this spring after two weeks of
unusually cool weather hurt sales, store buyers chose to wait to
mark down a lot of apparel items, and they eventually had to take
bigger cuts to match competitors. A new computer system, he said,
would have demanded that the markdowns be made earlier and would
have reduced the total markdown that was needed to move the
product.
</P>
<P>
   But stock analyst remain skeptical that technology will solve
the retailer's biggest problems, not least of all because Kmart's
competitors are already so far ahead in this area. ``Look you can
buy technology,'' said George Strachan, an analyst with Goldman
Sachs, ``but you also have to infuse the culture with how to use
technology, how to read the data. Besides, it is hard for me to
imagine any company leap-frogging Wal-Mart.''

LUCENT PAYING $1.3 BILLION FOR BAY STATE STARTUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Global telecommunications giants appear to have lost none of
their billion-dollar appetite for Massachusetts start-ups selling
innovative products and services they feel they need to compete _
the latest example being Lucent Technologies grabbing a Maynard
company for $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to bolster its strength to compete with Cisco Systems,
Nortel Networks, and others in offering Internet protocol
telecommunications services, Lucent said Tuesday it would issue
26.8 million of its shares to acquire Spring Tide Networks Inc., in
which Lucent already held a 4 percent stake. Two-year-old Spring
Tide has 130 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, Spring Tide sells devices and software to
allow phone companies and communications providers to deliver
profitable services over any kind of high-capacity network,
landline or wireless, such as private internal networks with
``firewalls'' for businesses and ``follow-me'' one-phone-number
services for business people and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Davidson, president of Lucent Technologies InterNetworking
Systems business, said the deal reflected Lucent's conviction that
``no one company has all the good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see companies that have good ideas that I haven't
thought of, I quickly form a relationship with them,'' Davidson
said.
</P>
<P>
   If those ``good ideas'' are compelling enough, analysts said,
using Lucent's battered but still richly appreciated stock to buy
them becomes a powerful way to fuel the company's efforts to keep
up with the Internet revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, Corning Inc., and Nortel have been no less shy about
using their bull market-fattened share prices to grab promising Bay
State start-ups, in a process many analysts compare to the giants
effectively ``outsourcing'' research and development work to little
companies they later buy for hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Lucent has looked to Massachusetts start-ups
to fill perceived product-line holes in everything from billing
systems, optical networking gear, and super-fast Internet routers
to software-based telecommunications switches that make adding new
calling features as easy as rewriting computer programs, instead of
having to install expensive new boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry officials generally were enthusiastic
about the deal, but cautioned that one deal alone will not leapfrog
Lucent ahead of networking market giant Cisco Systems or emerging
challenger Nortel Networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good acquisition for Lucent, and Spring Tide's
a great company,'' said Hassan Ahmed, president and chief executive
of Sonus Networks Inc. in Westford, who founded Sonus in 1997 soon
after his last company, Cascade Communications successor Ascend
Communications, was purchased by Lucent for nearly $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed said Spring Tide is a leader among companies that are
focusing on helping telecommunications providers offer profitable
services over newer, higher-capacity networks, independent of
whether those are landline, wireless, or cable broadband links.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent is using the acquisition as a method of getting
themselves into the new technology arena, where arguably they need
more strength in the data world,'' Ahmed said. ``The real challenge
for them once they've acquired these companies is to put the pieces
together and make them all work.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said Lucent will continue to use the Spring Tide brand
name and plans to incorporate it into the Murray Hill, N.J.-based
company as its own operating unit.
</P>
<P>
   Spring Tide chief technology officer Steve Akers will become CTO
for the entire Lucent unit, which also includes the former Nexabit
Networks in Marlborough, which makes super-high speed Net routers,
and Xedia in Acton, which Lucent bought last year for a combined
total of over $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Spring Tide CEO Allan Wallack and founder Stephen Collins said
they will stay with Lucent. Top Spring Tide executives come from
Stratus Computer Co., where they developed ``fault tolerant''
computers designed to work all but minutes or seconds a year.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition did not come as a complete bolt from the blue.
Lucent last December formed a comarketing arrangement with Spring
Tide that has led to deals including a $250 million pact announced
last week with AT&AMP;T Broadband to build out its fixed-wireless
network across the US. It also took a 4 percent stake in Spring
Tide in January as part of a venture capital round.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.3 billion purchase price is a home run for venture firms
that have put in a total of $62.9 million, among them North Bridge
Venture Partners, Matrix Partners, Oak Investment Partners, and
Meritech Capital Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent has bought 35 companies in the last four years, including
nine this year, most of them focused on fiber optics. Spring Tide
is the second Net-oriented company, and is aimed at a market that
is expected to grow from $660 million annually to $1.6 billion next
year, according to market researchers Ryan Hankin Kent Inc. of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent said it will take a charge against earnings in whatever
quarter the Spring Tide deal is completed. It said it hopes to
close the deal by Sept. 30. Lucent said the deal will cut earnings
per share by about 1 cent in the fiscal year that begins in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Spring Tide sells platforms for delivering IP-based services,
which convert voice into Net-style data packets and reconnect it to
create continuous sound, over virtually any kind of network,
including landline, wireless, cable broadband, and digital
subscriber lines. By converting voice to data packets it becomes
possible to add countless new services such as ``unified
mailboxes'' collecting voice mail, e-mail, and faxes in one place.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said in her view Spring Tide has no direct competitor
in New England because its devices have a unique combination of
reliability, service features, and ``scaleability,'' or the ability
to quickly plug in more users as demands for access grow.
</P>
<P>
   Spring Tide's IP Service Switch 5000 works hand-in-glove with
several Lucent products, including devices for providing DSL lines
and several types of routers and switches. ``Spring Tide's people,
technology and equipment will play a crucial role in our broadband
Internet infrastructure strategy,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent shares dropped 37.5 cents Tuesday to $49.875 in New York
Stock Exchange trading.

VILLALONGA EXPECTED TO STEP DOWN AT TELEFONICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chairman of the Spanish telecommunications company that is
acquiring Lycos Inc. is expected to resign, but it was unclear how
the move would affect the planned purchase of Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Villalonga, the controversial chairman of Telefonica SA,
could step down or be asked to leave at a regular company board
meeting scheduled for Wednesday, said an executive familiar with
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   A Telefonica spokesman declined to discuss whether Villalonga's
departure would interrupt the company's $12.5 billion deal to
purchase Lycos, of Waltha, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos chief executive Bob Davis said Tuesday the deal would
remain on track no matter what Villalonga's fate. ``This deal was
put together with four strong companies, and it will remain that
way,'' Davis said, echoing previous remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of this transaction would not in any way be
lessened by the departure of any one individual,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga has been the driving force behind the expansion of
Madrid-based Telefonica, which in May announced plans to buy Lycos
and merge it with its Terra Networks Internet unit to create a
global content and services company known as Terra Lycos. German
publisher Bertelsmann also pledged to buy up to $1 billion worth of
advertising and services in the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   But Villalonga's aggressive strategy alienated many in Spain's
business establishment, and he also faces an insider-trading
investigation by Spanish government regulators.
</P>
<P>
   While he denies wrongdoing, a Villalonga departure wouldn't be a
surprise to many investors and analysts. The question, they say,
would be whether a successor would follow through with the
agreement to acquire Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Telefonica, representatives of Terra Networks and
Bertelsmann declined to discuss the issue. Many investors hope
Telefonica's board agrees to continue with the Lycos purchase,
since the merger has driven Lycos stock up from around $35 a share
before the merger. Lycos shares closed at $59.69, a gain of $2.81
on the day.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is completed, Lycos shareholders would receive a
projected $97.55 worth of Terra shares for each of their existing
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Terra Lycos would have its headquarters in Barcelona, though
plans call for Davis to continue to run it as chief executive from
Waltham, where Lycos has about 600 employees. Villalonga was slated
to become chairman of the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga's expected departure was first reported by Madrid's
El Mundo newspaper, which supports Spain's center-right government.
The newspaper reported a decision might be delayed several days,
however, because of a death in Villalonga's family.
</P>
<P>
   With Villalonga's position in question, speculation on a
successor centered on Cesar Alierta Izuel, head of Spain's monopoly
tobacco company. ``Alierta is the only candidate that can be named
quickly'' under complicated succession rules, Luis Padron, a
telecommunications analyst at Banesto Bolsa SA, told Bloomberg
News. Izuel's views on the Lycos deal aren't known.

BAY STATE TAX REVENUES SURGE 10 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With Massachusetts enjoying the bounty of a robust and
long-running economic expansion, the state's tax revenues surged 10
percent in fiscal year 2000, which ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Department of Revenue confirmed Tuesday that
the $15.7 billion collected in the last fiscal year was a record.
And while collections of revenues have risen every year since 1990
_ that year, revenues declined in the midst of a deep recession _
last fiscal year's increase was unusually large.
</P>
<P>
   The annual report on the state's fiscal condition comes as
lawmakers on Beacon Hill last week approved a $21.55 billion budget
for the coming fiscal year, which includes a $164 million tax cut
for charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Cellucci is also currently being watched for possible
vetoes of items in the Democratic Legislature's budget. The
Republican governor, for example, is expected to veto a raise for
low-paid workers at state-sponsored nursing homes, though the
administration is likely to approve funds for financially
distressed hospitals. Lawmakers are also in the throes of
negotiating a financing package for a new baseball park for the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Revenue Department said the 10 percent revenue gain in
fiscal 2000 surpassed last year. In fiscal year 1999, by
comparison, the state collected $14.29 billion _ about a 2 percent
gain over the prior year. In 1999, a doubling in the personal
exemption allowed for individuals cut into tax receipts, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's primary sources of revenue are individual income
taxes, sales taxes, and corporate excise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   James St. George, executive director of the Tax Equity Alliance
for Massachusetts, a liberal tax advocacy group, said that he
believes last year's revenue may have also benefited from capital
gains earned on stock portfolios and from stock options granted
Massachusetts workers, particularly in the booming high-technology
industry. The alliance, he said, is researching the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is a bubble, the state could be in a lot of trouble,''
said St. George, who criticized a tax cut at a time state schools
are in dire need of funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Frederick Laskey, Massachusetts' revenue commissioner, said
stock gains were only ``a modest part'' of the state's bonanza.
Income tax and sales tax receipts are up, Laskey said, because so
many people are working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got record low unemployment, record high employment and
very strong wage growth,'' the commissioner said. ``That translates
into very robust revenue collections for us.'' He said
Massachusetts is ``doing very well'' compared with other states.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 2000, individuals paid $9.041 billion in income taxes,
more than $1 billion above what they paid during the prior year,
according to Revenue Department data, which was initially released
on July 14.
</P>
<P>
   Sales and use taxes collections were $3.565 billion, up from
$3.270 billion in 1999. Corporate excise taxes totaled $3.093
billion, up from $2.984 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, corporate excise taxes were 10.3. percent of total
state collections, compared with 10.9 percent in fiscal 1991, the
revenue department said.

38 STATE LEGAL CHIEFS PROTEST TOYSMART SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attorneys general from 38 states joined a chorus of opposition
Tuesday to a Federal Trade Commission settlement that would allow
failed Internet retailer Toysmart.com to sell customer data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toysmart had an explicit promise to consumers that their
privacy would be protected and their information would not be
shared with a third party,'' Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas
F. Reilly said. ``I see the sale not only as a threat to consumers
but also to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC sued the Waltham, Mass. toy seller earlier this month in
US District Court in Boston, saying the company had promised
shoppers it would never sell their personal information. Last week,
the federal agency reached an agreement allowing Toysmart.com to
sell customer files with certain restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Toysmart.com could sell its database only
to a family-oriented company that buys the entire Web site and
adheres to the online retailer's privacy policy. The company also
must delete 2,000 records that the FTC said were collected in
violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, said
Harry Murphy, an attorney for Toysmart.com.
</P>
<P>
   The new law bars sites from gathering data from children younger
than 13 without permission from their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's restrictions have not appeased consumers and privacy
advocates, who fear other beleaguered Internet retailers will
attempt to auction off customer data.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said Toysmart.com should not be allowed to sell the
database of more than 250,000 customer records without permission
from the retailer's shoppers. Without such protections, he fears
wary customers will begin abandoning the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is a balanced position,'' Reilly said. ``It
protects consumers. And it protects the Internet from itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is the leader among 38 states that filed an
objection to the sale in US Bankruptcy Court in Boston, where
Toysmart.com filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month.
Attorneys general from Texas and New York have filed separate
objections to the sale.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only two potential buyers for the database have emerged.
Last week, Direct Research Inc. of Kennebunk, Maine, said it would
enter the bidding. A subsidiary of Walt Disney Co., Toysmart.com's
majority owner, has bid $50,000 for the customer files.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney subsidiary would not stand in the way if the court
awards the database to a buyer who abides by the online retailer's
privacy policy and uses the list in ``continuation of Toysmart's
business,'' said Andrew Schwartz, an attorney for the Disney unit.
</P>
<P>
   If no such buyer emerged, the Disney subsidiary would buy the
database and have it destroyed, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement between the FTC and Toysmart.com requires the
approval of US Bankruptcy Judge Carol Kenner, who has scheduled a
hearing Wednesday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the court ultimately is going to be faced with the
question of whether the settlement negotiated with the FTC
represents a fair balance between the interests of customers and
the needs of creditors,'' Toysmart attorney Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenner has a reputation as a no-nonsense judge who has stood up
to protect consumers in the past. She is perhaps best known for
exposing the unlawful collection practices of Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.
_ after learning about the company's actions in a letter from an
unemployed and bankrupt security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Sears agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge of
bankruptcy fraud and pay a record $60 million fine for illegally
collecting more than $100 million from bankrupt credit-card
customers.

   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - The heat has been turned up and the
expectations for this year's Georgia football team are boiling
over.
</P>
<P>
   From the preseason publications to the Bulldog Club meeting in
Macon to the massive media contingent here, inquiring minds want to
know: Is this the year the Bulldogs finally catch Florida and
Tennessee?
</P>
<P>
   Most preseason prognosticators think so. Georgia, which returns
19 starters from last year's 8-4 squad, has been ranked as high as
third nationally in preseason polls. The Bulldogs haven't won an
SEC title since 1982, and haven't finished in the top five in the
national rankings in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at least one Georgia player believes this year's team
will be up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations are realistic,'' Bulldogs quarterback Quincy
Carter said. ``To me, winning the national championship is
realistic. But at the same time, we've got to understand that we
haven't accomplished any of those goals throughout the 1990s. To
start 2000 off with an SEC championship is our goal. I know the
stakes are high this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are especially high because Carter's junior season
will probably be his last one at Georgia. Bulldogs fans also are
impatient because Florida and Tennessee could be as vulnerable as
they've been in more than a decade. Both programs suffered heavy
personnel losses since last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of expectations and a lot of people are asking
me about our team,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan said. ``I do think
one of the reasons for the higher expectations is that we have a
lot of people coming back and Florida and Tennessee lost a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is the main reason the Bulldogs seem to be a
popular pick to win the SEC East - over Florida and Tennessee,
which combined to win 17 of 18 games vs. Georgia in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bulldogs athletics director Vince Dooley, long known for
his conservative demeanor, sounds optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that I'm more excited and more optimistic than
I've been in a long, long time,'' Dooley said at last week's Middle
Georgia Bulldog Club meeting in Macon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the hour, and we've got the man, and when the two
meet, I think we're going to see something we're all going to be
very happy with.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, who guided the Bulldogs to 27 wins the past three
seasons, seems to be the only one trying to temper expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to our team about the people saying that if
Georgia doesn't do it this year they'll never do it,'' Donnan said.
``I really think we're going to do it eventually. I feel that we've
laid a good foundation and are doing a lot of good things as a
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't say, `It's now or never.' The reality is that
we've got to be one of the best three or four teams in the country
to (win the SEC). We haven't proven that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Before last season, Donnan boasted that his program had closed
the talent gap on the Gators and Volunteers. The Bulldogs lost to
both of those schools by a combined score of 67-34, and the Georgia
defense finished last in the SEC, allowing 382.6 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan fired defensive coordinator Kevin Ramsey after only one
season, and replaced him with former Oklahoma head coach Gary
Gibbs, who had been retired since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Gibbs has a lot of experience,'' Georgia defensive
tackle Richard Seymour said. ``When you combine experience with
talent, it equals championships. I wouldn't trade our roster with
anyone right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs inherits a Georgia defense that includes three potential
first-round draft picks: Seymour and defensive tackle Marcus Stroud
and middle linebacker Kendrell Bell. But the Bulldogs must replace
two starters in the secondary and their punter and kicker.
</P>
<P>
   And Georgia must prove that it has finally reached its two
longtime rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked Georgia to win the SEC East,'' said John Adams,
sports editor of the Knoxville News-Sentinel, ``but there's little
conviction behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, they've got more talent than any team in the SEC.
But Georgia has to prove it can win the games that matter most.
Georgia has become what Tennessee once was - a team with a lot of
talent that has yet to win a big game.''

 &HT;    Revised rules prominent as Olympic gymnastic selections begin
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - One fall no longer can doom aspiring Olympic gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 John Hancock U.S. Championships begin today in St.
Louis. The top 14 men and 12 women advance to the Olympic trials,
Aug. 17-20 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time, each routine no longer is do or die. New
Olympic rules and a revamped selection process have led to the
possibility that a specialist or two on each team might go to
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is actually less pressure, I think,'' said Vanessa Atler,
18, one of the rising stars among U.S. women. ``If you've shown
that you've worked hard throughout the year, that's the big thing.
At Olympic trials, everybody's always afraid, `What if I mess up on
this one meet? This one meet determines, like, my whole life.' So I
think (the new procedure) is actually good.''
</P>
<P>
   Each team at the Olympics can bring six gymnasts. Five compete
on each apparatus, but only four scores will count, so a specialist
can shore up the weaker events.
</P>
<P>
   For the men, the four gymnasts with the best combined scores
from the nationals (40 percent) and the Olympic trials (60 percent)
will be on the team. The other two will be selected by coaches. For
the women, all six gymnasts will be selected by a four-member
committee, which includes national team coordinator Bela Karolyi.
The gymnasts' performances at the two major meets, as well as in
monthly training camps at Karolyi's ranch, will be factors.
</P>
<P>
   Five members of the gold-medal-winning ``Magnificent Seven''
from Atlanta are back for another tumble at Olympic glory. Two-time
Olympians Shannon Miller and Dominique Dawes, as well as Jaycie
Phelps, came out of retirement, while Dominique Moceanu and Amy
Chow had remained competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who injured her leg in practice recently, might compete
only in balance beam and uneven bars in St. Louis and then petition
into the trials.
</P>
<P>
   Atler said she does not think the gold medalists should step
aside for the younger athletes, including her, Kristen Maloney and
Elise Ray and Morgan White.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think whoever wants to do it, and whoever wants to put in
the hard work, it's fine with me,'' she said. ``The better the
team, the better for the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi promises that the ``most spectaculous'' athletes will go
to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Men's team coordinator Peter Kormann, a 1976 Olympian, calls his
crop ``the deepest team that we've had in the last 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Four-time national champ Blaine Wilson is the top contender,
along with two-time Olympian John Roethlisberger, Jason Gatson and
Augusta's Jay Thornton. Thornton's brother, Todd, and former
Atlanta gymnast Michael Ashe also will compete.

&HT;    ROUTINE

 &HT;    
 &HT;    SUSPENSE-HUNGRY PRESS LOOKING TO GORE
 &HT;

<TEXT>
<P>
   As George W. Bush named Dick Cheney the man he wants as his
vice-presidential running mate Tuesday, one big question loomed in
the minds of political pundits and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Already sure the Texas governor will be named the Republican
presidential candidate at the GOP national convention next week and
that Cheney is a cinch to win the delegates' approval as Bush's
running mate, the press was wrestling with one more
vice-presidential question.
</P>
<P>
   Who, they pondered, will Al Gore select to run on the Democratic
ticket with him?
</P>
<P>
   And that, friends and neighbors, sums up about as well as
anything the state of party politics and major party nominating
conventions in America.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the press, much less the public, had a clue Cheney
would be Bush's ultimate choice, the press already was so restless
with the Republican process, many members of the corps were picking
up on hints Gore might name his veep choice about the time the
final gavel came down at the GOP confab in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The idea would be to flatten the bounce the Texas governor
rightly could expect to lift his political standing as he and his
running mate come out of what rightly can be expected to be four
days of political sweetness and light among the GOPers.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, political media, thy true calling is as scenario spinners.
</P>
<P>
   Even to the very last, there were those who would not give up on
the prospect Colin Powell had changed his and his wife's minds and
he would run for vice president with Bush after all. They spun
wonderful yarns about how all the moves Cheney was making to clear
the way for him to become Bush's running mate actually were part of
a grand subterfuge designed to obscure the fact Powell would be on
the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   This example, as will be the increasing speculation about Gore's
final choice, is not simply a press device to create interest in
its product _ be it printed or broadcast. It, far more, is a way to
try to inject some suspense into a convention structure designed to
be suspenseful but reduced to being more informative pep rallies
than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, while Bush's selection of Cheney may not play to
excite, it does a super job of strengthening what Bush considers
one of his strongest points as a candidate and a quality most
Americans would relish in a president.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney was chief of staff for former President Ford, he
served six terms as Wyoming's rep in the U.S. House, where he was
considered a leader who had no way to go but up, when he was tapped
by GWB's father to be secretary of defense in the elder Bush's
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   A strong, but calm, conservative, he is widely well-liked and
widely well-regarded by many Democrats _ including, at least at one
time, Al Gore _ and by many members of the Washington press corps.
</P>
<P>
   Who better, on reflection, to back up a presidential candidate
who is campaigning as someone who can, and will, tamp down the
partisan fires that have burned so hotly in Washington of late.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ability to work well with Democrats has been one of his
greatest assets as governor of Texas. Even today, as Republican
Bush is campaigning to move way up the political ladder, current
Democratic Speaker of the Texas House Pete Laney still openly
speaks quite well of him.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, it has been reported that Jan Bullock, the
widow of Democrat Bob Bullock _ one long alternately revered and
feared as a political force in Texas _ will be one of several
Texans to introduce Bush the final night of the GOP convention when
he is to accept the presidential nomination in a speech that will
be madly critiqued for political eons yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   So yet to be interpreted ad infinitum _ maybe ad nauseam _ is
Bush's selection of Cheney as his running mate. There is no
question Cheney well meets the principal criteria Bush consistently
has said he was seeking in his choice for vice president: that he
be someone well-qualified to assume the presidency if need be and
that he be someone Bush likes and respects and who will be loyal to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the wires hummed as the pompoms still were waving at the
GOP ticket's first appearance together. Cheney is not a bold
choice. He's safe, we were told. He's blah, we were not told but
led to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The suspense was gone from the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Now it centers on Gore, who, it already was being said Tuesday,
could really make political waves if he could figure out how to get
Colin Powell on his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is a question. &QL;

 &HT;

<P>
   What's not to like about Dick Cheney, if you fancy a very
conservative-but-pragmatic internationalist Republican who's
familiar with the horrors that lurk in the loopy wing of his party.
Given George W. Bush's decision not to stand up to the
anti-abortion zealots, the Texas governor could have done a lot
worse in selecting a vice-presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   In a Republican context, Cheney is politically safe without
being boring. He's establishment without being Ivy League unto
death. There's a youthful charm in his flunking out of Yale. Almost
40 years on, Cheney oozes seriousness and probity, which he can
carry off while wearing cowboy boots. He has credibility on the old
twin avenues of the Republican universe _ Wall Street and Main
Street. He is a quick study whose low-key authority should wipe the
smirk off Democrats' faces when they say the word ``debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is unlikely to make the kind of mistake that takes
vice-presidential candidates from their traditional obscurity to
unwanted notoriety. And Cheney fills Bush's two principal
requirements: He could serve, without hesitation, as president, and
his loyalty seems unshakable.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and his campaign chiefs, depending on who's running the
show this week, may overreach and seek to portray Cheney as the
anti-Christ. They may want to pick over his student and parental
deferments during the Vietnam War (he never served in the military,
but later was its civilian chief) and his health record (three
heart attacks, beginning at age 37, and subsequent quadruple bypass
surgery). At the least, the Democratic campaign will attempt to
paint Cheney as a retro leftover from an administration (that of
Bush's father) which voters rejected in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's own record, in the House of Representatives and at the
Pentagon, is not without its serious flaws. He opposed sanctions on
the apartheid government in South Africa and was an enthusiastic
supporter of three of the biggest excesses toward the end of the
Cold War: Ronald Reagan's Star Wars fantasy and aid to rebels in
Nicaragua and Angola. As defense secretary he hung tenaciously to
the old canard that service by homosexuals is incompatible with
necessary military standards.
</P>
<P>
   So, he's a Republican. And being from Wyoming (now and again),
he's not too keen on gun control either and even voted against the
ban on armor-piercing ``cop killer'' bullets.
</P>
<P>
   But in a game and a town in which personality and style can be
as important as policy positions, Cheney quickly won and maintained
high marks in Washington for civility. Close associates can
remember seeing him distressed and disappointed but never in the
purple rage that too often is a politician's response to challenges
or adversity. Since his name surfaced over the weekend as Bush's
likely selection, Democratic associates from Cheney's days in
Congress have had to try to check their enthusiasm for him
personally _ and several have failed at the task.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a Bush-Cheney administration, and the new president
carries through on his determination to seek a bipartisan working
relationship with a cosmically riven Congress, in Cheney he will
have an experienced partner for the challenging endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bruce Cheney can be fiercely, but not blindly or
stupidly, partisan. He is firmly grounded in the civilized wing of
his party that stretches back through Gerald R. Ford, the GOP House
leader who became the un-elected president and tapped Cheney as his
chief of staff, and Robert H. Michel, the House GOP chief to whom
Cheney became No. 2. Those were the days before the House devolved
into a full-time, scorched-earth food fight.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney arrived originally in Washington as a Congressional
Fellow. He worked for Rep. William A. Steiger, one of the class
acts in Congress until his untimely death at 40 in 1978. Cheney was
handed along the Republican talent network to the Office of
Economic Opportunity under Donald Rumsfeld, another of the GOP's
``bright young things'' from the House in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, however, soon learned to fend for himself in the
byzantine byways of Washington, moving on to the White House
(youngest chief of staff ever at 34), the House and then the
Pentagon. It's a solid career that has earned him a place on Bush's
ticket.

CHENEY WAS ONE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE VOICES IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
 (With BUSH-CHENEY) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his 10 years as a Republican congressman from
Wyoming, Dick Cheney had one of the most consistently conservative
voting records in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He regularly voted for the tightest restrictions on abortions,
including proposals to ban Medicaid coverage of abortions for poor
women whose lives could be endangered by continued pregnancy. And
he voted against all gun-control legislation, including measures
that were supported by all but a handful of lawmakers from both
parties, like one bill to regulate what are known as cop-killer
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   On issues where business and labor were on opposite sides, he
invariably supported the business position. When developers and
environmentalists were at odds, he was on the side of the
developers.
</P>
<P>
   He opposed a constitutional amendment to guarantee equal rights
to women and voted against economic sanctions on South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   During Cheney's time in Congress, from 1979 to 1989, Democrats
were in control of the House. As is normally the case with
lawmakers in the minority party, he was not directly responsible
for any major legislation.
</P>
<P>
   While he was rigidly conservative on issues, he was never known
for strident rhetoric and was well liked by Democratic colleagues.
Cheney was not a visible leader in the fight to outlaw abortion,
but the National Right to Life Committee said Tuesday that he voted
against abortion rights on all the roll calls for which he was
present.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he voted in 1984 for a measure to define
``person'' under discrimination laws to include fetuses. The
sponsor of the measure, which Al Gore, then a congressman, also
supported, said its purpose was to deny federal funds to all
institutions performing abortions. Cheney also expressed support
for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion, though the
matter never came to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations that lobby for and against abortion rights
were unable Tuesday to find a single instance during Cheney's time
in Congress when he spoke out on abortion, and none appeared in
computer data bases of news articles. In an interview in 1995 on
CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' Cheney said, ``I'm personally pro-life.
I've always supported that position.''
</P>
<P>
   He was an unwavering advocate of the Reagan administration's
economic policy of deep tax cuts, more spending for the military
and less money for social programs, and he was instrumental in
rallying support for these programs.
</P>
<P>
   Annual vote analyses by Congressional Quarterly showed that in
most of the years he was in the House, Cheney supported President
Reagan more consistently than almost any other member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In only his second term, he moved into the Republican
leadership, and by the time he left, to become secretary of defense
under President Bush, he was the Republican whip, the No. 2
position. Had he stayed in the House, he might well have become
speaker when Republicans gained control in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his leadership responsibilities, Cheney was most deeply
involved in foreign policy and intelligence matters. He strongly
supported covert funding of guerrilla forces trying to oust the
communist governments in Nicaragua and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Cheney served as the top Republican on the House
committee that investigated the Iran-contra affair. The committee
determined that the Reagan administration had secretly sold arms to
Iran and had used the proceeds to fund the rebels, known as
contras, in Nicaragua. Cheney voted against the final report, which
accused Reagan of failing to live up to his constitutional mandate
to ``take care that the laws be faithfully executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some issues that were politically important when Cheney was in
Congress are no longer in the news. For example, he repeatedly
voted to produce the MX missile, a hugely expensive weapon designed
to carry 10 nuclear warheads that was the political symbol of what
opponents believed to be the excesses of the Reagan nuclear weapons
policy.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, he often voted against proposals to apply
economic sanctions on South Africa to protest that country's
apartheid policy. He even voted in 1986 against a nonbinding
congressional resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela
from prison.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year in Congress, Cheney voted for a constitutional
amendment to ban busing for school desegregation. In 1980, he voted
against strengthening the laws banning discrimination in housing.
</P>
<P>
   The only time he turned against the Reagan administration on an
important issue was in 1985, when he helped lead a Republican
revolt against a bill negotiated by the president and Democratic
leaders to overhaul the federal income tax system. He accused the
administration of selling out to the Democrats. Even after the bill
was further modified by the Republican-controlled Senate and came
back to the House in 1986, he voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan signed the tax bill and considered it one of his foremost
legislative accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Many other issues of Cheney's time in Congress will be top items
in this year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, he was one of just 21 House members to vote
against a measure regulating the manufacture, import and sale of
armor-piercing ammunition known as cop-killer bullets. He was one
of four who voted in 1988 against a proposal to ban firearms that
did not contain enough metal to be picked up by a metal detector.
</P>
<P>
   On education, Cheney often voted against Head Start, the federal
preschool program for poor children. He also voted in 1985 against
federal aid to college students, and he opposed the creation of the
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   On the environment, he voted in 1987 against extending the Clean
Water Act and in favor of postponing sanctions against cities that
did not comply with it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he managed to keep friends on the Democratic side of the
aisle and when he joined the Bush administration as defense
secretary, among those predicting he would do a good job were two
Democratic congressional colleagues, Al Gore and Tony Coelho, the
former chairman of Gore's presidential campaign.

   TUKTOYAKTUK, Northwest Territories _ Here on North America's
northern edge, a treeless peninsula offers a timeless scene: slabs
of whale meat drying in the 24-hour summer sun, a chained husky
barking at visitors and a chill wind blowing off polar ice, only 10
miles offshore.
</P>
<P>
   But wedged between a Royal Canadian Mounted Police barracks and
the wind-whipped waves of the Beaufort Sea, tourists now inspect a
new sight: a tricolor sculpture marking this native village as the
Arctic trail head for a new 10,000-mile trail network stretching
from sea to sea to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic, the Trans Canada Trail
is to be inaugurated in September when relay runners converge near
Ottawa with flasks of water from Canada's three oceans. Billed as
the world's longest recreational trail, it will be open to hiking,
bicycling, horseback riding, cross-country skiing and, in some
areas, skating and snowmobiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecotourism is becoming a huge industry,'' said Rob McPhee, a
Yellowknife resident who was part of a five-member team that
undertook an 86-day trans-Arctic snowmobile trip from here to
Iqaluit, capital of the new Nunavut Territory, which was carved out
of the eastern half of the Northwest Territories in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The team left here in February after ceremonies that included
drilling through six feet of ice to draw sealskin bags filled with
water from the Arctic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing Canada's 10 provinces and three territories, the trail
is doing more this summer than promoting tourism.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 19th century, Canadians rallied around the epic
effort to push a railroad across their new nation. As the
automobile age flourished after World War II, Canadians rallied
around the construction of the Trans-Canada highway. Today, the
construction of a cross-country recreational trail has become a
21st-century exercise in nation building. In a country where each
province trades more with the United States than with the rest of
Canada, the trail redirects the Canadians' gaze from south to east,
to west, and even to north.
</P>
<P>
   ``It encourages people from the south to go up and see what our
country really is,'' said Carol Jones, an occupational health
specialist who divides her time between Ontario and Inuvik, a town
85 miles southwest of here that is Canada's northernmost spot
reachable by car. ``During the summers, you used to see more people
here from Europe than from Canada. All of a sudden you are seeing
Ontario vehicles. I give a lot of credit to the publicity the media
has done of the trail.''
</P>
<P>
   One visitor, Betty Veitch, a retired schoolteacher who drove
from Ontario to Inuvik with two friends, said after flying here:
``We had our picture taken with the monument. It was quite
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   As the three relay teams snake their way this summer across
Canada, the world's second largest country, after Russia,
excitement is building. So far, 5,000 volunteer water carriers have
signed up for the relay, 250,000 Canadians have donated money for
trail construction, and, in June, trail brochures were mailed to
every household in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting Canada's diversity, the water canisters have moved by
dog sleds here in the Arctic, by Indian war canoes in the Pacific,
and, to the sound of bagpipes, by a team of joggers from a
lighthouse in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in one town of 60 people, and they had 300 people
there,'' said Sherman Olson, chairman of the Trans Canada Trail
Foundation, the nonprofit group that is creating the trail. The
inauguration ceremonies in Hull, Quebec, across the river from
Ottawa, are set for Sept. 9 so schoolchildren across Canada can
watch live television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Intended to celebrate the millennium, the project, integrating
existing trail networks and adding new ones, is expected to be only
75 percent complete this fall. The trail's biggest benefactor so
far has been Canadian Pacific Railroad, which donated 1,000 miles
of discontinued rail lines. Canadian National Railroad is expected
to make a similar donation in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing will probably take another five years to
complete,'' Olson said from his home near Vancouver. ``Then you
will be able to walk from Victoria, British Columbia, to St.
John's, Newfoundland, on a trail, not on a road.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian magazines regularly publish free supplements about the
progress of the trail and DaimlerChrysler Canada has donated fleets
of Jeeps to the Trail Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronfman Foundation has given $1 million for signs and
pavilions. The pavilions will hold trail information as well as the
name of each person who donated $25 for the construction of a yard
of trail.
</P>
<P>
   The trail logo is a stylized maple leaf composed of three
arrows, which represent the three coastal trail heads and
``directions west, north and east emanating from Canada's
heartland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have politicians saying `coast to coast,' not `coast to
coast to coast,''' said Katherine McPhee, northern coordinator of
the relay race and wife of Rob. ``When you hear people talk of
Canada's three waters, it is a tremendous boost for the north.''

STUDY SHOWS LONG-TERM BENEFITS OF EDUCATION REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT S. GREENBERGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years of scores on a respected national test suggest that
education reforms by states eventually may bear fruit, according to
the authors of a study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The RAND Corp., a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank, analyzed
scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress and
determined that Texas, which implemented standardized testing and
extensive school accountability systems before much of the rest of
the nation, performed the best.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1996, the Lone Star State had the
second-greatest improvement in math scores and ranked the highest
when RAND compared students from similar socioeconomic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay State's 1993 education reform law includes reforms
similar to those in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't explain the gains in Texas strictly by the amount of
resource changes,'' said David Grissmer, one of the authors of the
study. ``We think the changes in scores have to reflect the
systemic reform efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The RAND study is based on test scores from 1990, 1992, 1994 and
1996. The US Department of Education administered the test to
representative samples of 2,500 students from each of 44 states
which volunteered to participate. The National Assessment of
Educational Progress is generally viewed as a more accurate
barometer of student achievement than state tests because teachers
don't know which students will be taking it and therefore cannot
teach to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts ranked 10th out of the 44 states in terms of its
``raw'' scores. But the authors of the study say that comparing
students from similar backgrounds is more meaningful, and when the
scores were adjusted for that, Massachusetts fell to 17th. The Bay
State ranked 28th in math score improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors that seem to boost performance, according to
Grissmer, are small class sizes, ``well-resourced'' teachers, and
extensive pre-K programs.
</P>
<P>
   The American Federation of Teachers compared Texas to its
demographic cousin, California, in arguing that the report shows
the importance of spending enough money on public education.
California ranked last when students of similar backgrounds were
compared.
</P>
<P>
   ``California, which fared poorly in the report, is an example of
what happens when you take away investment from public schools,''
federation president Sandra Feldman said in a written statement.
``California's public schools were once a source of great pride _
before they were starved of resources.''

ARAB LEADERS BEHIND ARAFAT'S UNWILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE ON
JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS; see also MIDEAST-ADVISORY-NYT for complete
list of stories) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ The refusal of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, to negotiate away his claims to Jerusalem may have dashed
U.S. hopes of a Camp David peace agreement Tuesday, but it allowed
him to return home with his credibility among other Arab leaders
intact, Middle East analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is now expected to solidify that backing with a round of
consultations in the region, beginning with a visit to President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on Wednesday morning in the Egyptian port
city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials here said that Arafat would probably meet
soon with many of the Arab leaders who had urged him, in public
statements and private telephone conversations, to hold firm on his
demands for an end to Israel's 33 years of exclusive control over
East Jerusalem and the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   The question of Jerusalem, which contains sites holy to Muslims
and Christians as well as to Jews, was said to have been the main
sticking point in the intense negotiations at Camp David in pursuit
of a settlement to the long Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official reaction from Arab capitals to the
announcement that the Camp David talks had ended. A spokesman for
the Arab League in Cairo said officials would wait until Arafat
briefs them on his negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Arab television channels, which are state owned, reported the
breakdown without commentary.
</P>
<P>
   However, on the Al-Jezeera satellite TV station, owned by a
member of the ruling family of the Gulf state of Qatar, and one of
the few outlets for debate in the Arab world, the analysis was
overwhelmingly supportive of Arafat. ``Clinton said Israel
compromised more than the Palestinians, but this is not accurate,''
Helmi Barakat, a political analyst based in Washington, said in a
Jezeera interview. ``According to international law, Jerusalem is
occupied land, and I do not believe the Arabs should be expected to
compromise or give up their sovereignty over Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few days, a number of Arab leaders, from Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to Mubarak, have joined with
Arafat's domestic opponents in various Islamic militant movements
to weigh in on the issue. They all but threatened Arafat with
political excommunication if he accepted Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's proposals for only administrative control over parts of the
city and access to _ but not sovereignty over _ the major Muslim
sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of many analysts, however, Arafat did not need any
reminders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat knew beforehand that any compromise on Jerusalem would
be the end of Arafat,'' said Tahsin Basheer, a former aide to Anwar
Sadat, the late Egyptian president who was the first Arab leader to
make peace with Israel, in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials also said Arafat was acutely aware,
throughout the peace talks, that Jerusalem was an especially
sensitive issue for the Arab leaders whose support he needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that here in Egypt, just like in Saudi Arabia, in
Jordan and elsewhere in the region, the leaders have to worry about
their own home constituencies when it comes to Jerusalem,'' said
Mohammed Subieh, the general-secretary of the Palestine National
Council and the Palestinian representative in the Arab League in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Arab control of the Old City has been a rallying cry not only
for Palestinian nationalists through the years. It has also been a
slogan for the Islamic fundamentalist movements that have mounted
violent opposition to any Arab regime that attempts to normalize
relations between Arabs and Israelis.

<P>
   Mubarak, who has been actively involved in the Arab-Israeli
peace effort for years, conferred several times with Arafat during
the talks. But he did not follow the U.S. line and push Arafat to
compromise, as he has in the past on issues other than Jerusalem,
Egyptian officials and diplomats in Cairo said.
</P>
<P>
   As Mubarak's information director, Maged Abdel Fattah, said
earlier this week, the Egyptian president saw his role as helping
U.S. diplomats, and not Arafat, understand that Christian and
Muslim Arabs around the world can accept only certain
``parameters'' when it comes to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Clinton said in his post-mortem on the negotiations,
these were the first substantive talks between an Arab leader and
an Israeli leader on the subject of Jerusalem. But outside the
confines of the presidential retreat, analysts said, they also
revived old shibboleths and emotions that could be difficult to
contain.

   WASHINGTON _ U.S.-sponsored Mideast peace talks broke up in
failure Tuesday, as Israeli and Palestinian leaders were unable to
resolve the most intractable issue at the heart of their 52-year
dispute, the fate of the holy city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   A deeply disappointed President Clinton, who spent most of the
past two weeks pressing the negotiations at nearby Camp David, said
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat made ``real headway'' on many of the territorial and
security issues dividing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we were, in the end, unable to bridge the gaps,'' Clinton
said. ``They couldn't get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The acrimonious collapse of the summit _ each side blamed the
other for its failure _ left in its wake a feeling of uncertainty
and a potential for violence in the fractious Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had the summit fallen apart than some Palestinians in
Gaza threatened to try to win through bloodshed what they couldn't
secure at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vowed to pick up the pieces of the dangling peace
process in the weeks ahead, in hopes of reconstituting the talks in
late summer or early fall between Arafat and Barak. He said both
left Camp David still committed to their self-imposed Sept. 13
deadline for completing a comprehensive peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the sake of their children, they must re-dedicate
themselves to the path of peace and find a way to resume their
negotiations in the next few weeks,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The venue's not important, the mechanisms aren't important,
but we know what the state of play is now,'' Clinton said. ``If
we'll keep at it, I still think we can get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   After 14 days of intensive talks produced no accord at Camp
David, however, Clinton conceded that there was no clear way
forward in the Mideast peace process and no assurance that the
region won't veer off the path of diplomacy and descend into
violence in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a script that's never been written before,'' Clinton
told reporters at the White House, immediately after the half-hour
helicopter flight from the presidential retreat in western
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped just short of blaming Arafat for the failed
talks. He did say, though, that Barak showed greater flexibility
than the aging Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister moved forward more from his initial
position than (PLO) Chairman Arafat, particularly surrounding the
questions of Jerusalem,'' Clinton said. ``He (Barak) came in
knowing that he was going to have to take bold steps, and he did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the contrast between Clinton's effusive praise for Barak's
approach to the talks and his comparatively dim assessment of
Arafat's performance left little doubt that Clinton saw a need for
further movement by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Minister Barak showed particular courage, vision, and an
understanding of the historical importance of this moment,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Clinton said Arafat ``made it clear that he too
remains committed to the path of peace,'' at several points in his
White House press conference, he returned to praising Barak without
offering comparable support for Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he (Barak) took a big risk,'' Clinton said. ``This is
not a weak man. I mean, he didn't come over here to play safe with
his political future, he came over here to do what he thought was
right for the people of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak called a press conference to lay the blame for the failed
summit directly on Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had offered Palestinians limited sovereignty over
parts of East Jerusalem. Arafat rejected the compromise, however,
insisting instead on full Arab control of the enclave, which he
wants as the capital of a new Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready to end the conflict,'' Barak told reporters at a
hotel in Frederick, Md., about 20 miles from the Catoctin Mountain
retreat at Camp David. ``But, unfortunately, Arafat somehow
hesitated to take the historic decisions that were needed in order
to put an end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak was careful, though, to leave the door open for future
negotiations with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision of peace suffered a major blow,'' he said. ``But I
believe that with good faith, goodwill on all sides, it can
recuperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat left the summit without making any public comments.
</P>
<P>
   However, Palestinian officials have consistently blamed Barak
throughout the talks for not yielding on the question of East
Jerusalem, territory Israel seized during the 1967 Arab-Israeli
war.
</P>
<P>
   By publicly ruling out any division of Jerusalem from the
beginning of the summit, the Palestinians have said, Barak poisoned
the atmosphere and doomed the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israeli position was the cause of failure,'' Tayeb Abdel
Rahim, a top Arafat aide, told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The talks fell apart despite aggressive bargaining by Clinton,
who said he gave Israelis assurances of U.S. security assistance
and promised American aid dollars to help resettle Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave no further details on those commitments, but he
left no doubt that Jerusalem was the sticking point that sunk the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most difficult problem,'' Clinton said. ``We tried
a lot of different approaches to it and we have not yet found a
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   In Palestinian-controlled Gaza, the militant group Hamas called
for a resumption of armed struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution now is that Mr. Arafat and the negotiators
declare the failure and futility of the entire peace process and
return to the path of resistance and jihad (holy struggle),''
senior Hamas official Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi told the Reuters news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has threatened to unilaterally declare a Palestinian
state if he and Barak can't agree to a peace treaty by the
mid-September deadline.
</P>
<P>
   While Arafat did not withdraw the threat _ at least not publicly
_ he did agree, in a statement that he, Clinton and Barak all
signed, to ``understand the importance of avoiding unilateral
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters there was
no question that the statement applied to the declaration of
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were working at was to have a Palestinian state as
part of a comprehensive aspect, not unilateral,'' she said. ``We've
made very clear that we think that unilateral actions are not
useful. That includes the declaration of a Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating criticism that he had called the summit before
laying the groundwork for success, Clinton said the atmosphere
between Israelis and Palestinians had been deteriorating in recent
months and that the summit was the best way he knew of to try to
arrest the slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had no choice,'' he said. ``We can't afford to
leave a single stone unturned in the search for a just, lasting and
comprehensive peace.''

STUDY CREDITS SMALL CLASSES AND PRESCHOOL FOR STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smaller class size in early grades and access to preschool
appear to increase student achievement, particularly in
impoverished communities, more than the salaries, education or
experience of teachers, a national study released Tuesday says.
</P>
<P>
   The state-by-state analysis of standardized test results
suggests that policy initiatives to boost student achievement have
been effective, with math scores climbing steadily across the
country at an average rate of about one percentile point each year
from 1990 to 1996. Texas and a handful of other states that were
among the leaders in adopting new standards and accountability
systems have shown particular gains, including significantly higher
scores by poor students and those from minority groups than by
their counterparts in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public education is reformable,'' declared David Grissmer, the
principal author of the book-length study published by Rand Corp.,
a policy and research group based in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, we were unsure whether reform in the states
was working and if spending more money would make any difference in
educational outcomes,'' Grissmer said. ``We see gains in some
states from reform efforts, and we see that resources, if they're
properly targeted, can be very effective at raising achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   The study presents a mixed picture for politicians arguing over
how to spend education dollars, and, in calling for increased
federal spending to reduce disparities among states, is sure to
provide fodder for debate in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore
immediately highlighted the report on their campaign Web sites,
with Bush celebrating the declaration of his state as a national
leader and Gore noting that class-size reduction and universal
preschool _ programs praised in the report _ form the centerpiece
of his $115 billion education agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud of the results we have achieved in education in
Texas,'' Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, said in a
statement. ``As president, I will achieve the same results,
ensuring that no child is left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   But William A. Galston, a senior adviser to Gore, the
all-but-named Democratic nominee, pointed out that Bush did not
even become governor until 1995, near the end of the period
studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told, though I'm not a farm boy, that roosters crow when
the sun comes up,'' said Galston, director of the Institute for
Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland. ``I am
told by some farmers that some roosters are under the impression
that they have caused the sun to rise, but they did not.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the partisan pot shots, though, educators and state
policymakers found crucial lessons in the report, which links
scores on a national standardized test to census data and variables
such as per pupil spending and class size for the first time. The
study looked at seven math and reading tests administered in 44
states through the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a
federal program that tests samples of 4th-, 8th- and 12th-graders
and is often referred to as the nation's report card.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   There is wide disparity in performance across the states for
students from socio-economically similar families. Texas topped the
list, with students scoring an average of 11 percentile points
higher than their counterparts in last-ranked California. The
states succeeding in this measure tended to spend more money per
student, have lower student-teacher ratios and less teacher
turnover, provide more public pre-kindergarten classes and have
teachers report satisfaction with their classroom resources.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at raw scores, states clustered near the top were mostly
northern and rural, including Minnesota, Montana and Maine, while
the 10 lowest performers were eight Southern states, California and
New Mexico. The study's authors attribute this largely to
demographics.
</P>
<P>
   While math scores increased across the country, there was
considerable range in gains among the states. North Carolina
students improved nearly 2.5 percentile points each year, and those
in Texas and Michigan 2 percentile points, more than twice the
national average; Wyoming, Georgia, Delaware, Utah and North Dakota
showed minuscule gains or none at all.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher salaries, their years in the classroom and the
percentage of the teaching force with masters' degrees appear to
have little impact on student performance, though Grissmer said
more study of these factors is necessary. The report said education
dollars would be better spent on classroom-based resources to
improve teacher working conditions _ such as computers and voice
mail and curriculum materials _ or on reducing class size than on
wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see such a sophisticated study confirming a
truth too many people want to ignore: poor children achieve at
lower rates because we give them an inferior education,'' said Kati
Haycock, director of the Education Trust, a Washington group
focused on disadvantaged students. ``With targeted investments and
high expectations, we can close the achievement gap once and for
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But while most people praised the report's rigor, some
questioned the usefulness of analyzing test scores that predate
many state reform initiatives and other aspects of its methodology.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Loveless, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who is also
studying NAEP data, pointed out that the math scores Grissmer used
come from a new test that tracks curriculums introduced widely in
the last decade, and that scores on an older form of the exam,
which emphasizes basic skills such as arithmetic, have been flat in
the 1990's.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, questioned whether the analysis of teacher pay and
experience remains relevant now that the country is facing a
teacher shortage.
</P>
<P>
   And Susan K. Burr, California's interim secretary of education,
noted that in the past two years, her state has cut class size in
kindergarten to fourth grade from 28 students to 20; increased per
pupil spending by nearly $1,000, and instituted an accountability
system similar to the one in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The report, she said, is ``ancient history.''

JOY, DISAPPOINTMENT AND CONFUSION IN ISRAEL _ BUT LITTLE SURPRISE

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When the news from Washington crackled through on
their transistor radios, a group of Jewish men keeping vigil atop
the Mount of Olives broke into songs of praise that East Jerusalem,
spread out before them in the last rays of a setting sun, would
not, at least for now, be reverting to any form of Arab control.
</P>
<P>
   From dawn, the cluster of ultraconservative ``rejectionists'' _
rabbis, professors and right-wing sectarian leaders who have
opposed peace talks with Israel's Arab neighbors since the original
Camp David talks in 1978 _ had been encamped above the Jewish
cemeteries that cascade down the hillside.
</P>
<P>
   Through the heat of the day, they prayed, fasted and alternated
readings from the Torah and the Talmud, imploring God to condemn
the latest Camp David talks to failure.
</P>
<P>
   About 6 p.m., when the Voice of Israel announced that the talks
had collapsed over the disagreement of the future status of
Jerusalem, with Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, reportedly rejecting proposals that would have
given limited control over parts of East Jerusalem to the
Palestinians, the mood became triumphal.
</P>
<P>
   In moments, the biblical songs began ringing out across the
valley toward the Temple Mount on the other side where Arabs, at
the Dome of the Rock, and Jews, at the Western Wall, were gathering
at dusk to pay their separate obeisances to God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been praying all day that God would intervene and
prevent this disaster from befalling the people of Israel,'' said
Baruch Ben-Yosef, a 41-year-old rabbi who came to Israel from New
York as a teen-ager. ``Now, our prayers have been answered. Barak
has been stopped from selling out the land of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   But just in case, he said, he and his fellows would maintain
their vigil through the night. ``We want to be sure he gets on the
plane, that he doesn't loop back to Camp David and change his mind,
that the whole thing is done and dead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But on an evening that many Jews and Palestinians described as
marking a watershed in their shared history, the certainties of the
men atop the Mount of Olives were rare.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the failure in Washington spread across this ancient
city, from television sets in cafes and bars, from radios in the
bazaars of the old city, and across the network of mobile phones
that have Israelis and Palestinians engaging in seemingly nonstop
talk even on days when there is no major news, the more common
reaction seemed to be one of disappointment, confusion and even of
fear.
</P>
<P>
   There was not, however, much surprise. The likelihood that the
Camp David negotiations would break down had been bannered across
headlines here for days. But more than that, what emerged from a
random sounding of reaction across the city as the evening wore on
was a mood suggesting that many here, on both sides, had been
forced by events in Washington into accepting harsh realities they
always knew were likely to overwhelm the hopes and dreams nurtured
by more than two decades of on-and-off peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   In a dozen conversations, the common thread was a sense that
Barak and Arafat, in dashing the hopes of a final peace agreement,
had bowed to a gap, irreducible now and possibly for a long time to
come, between the competing political visions of their
constituents. On the issue of Jerusalem, it seemed from these
conversations, it is not only hard-liners like the men atop the
Mount of Olives, but also many others on both sides who consider
themselves secularists and moderates who are not yet ready for the
historic concessions that would have been necessary under President
Clinton's compromise plan.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian shopkeeper from Bethlehem, Ismail Kanan, caught
the mood of many other Palestinians when he said he was bitterly
disappointed that the Camp David talks had ended without agreement,
because the peace effort had come a long way since 1978, and the
two sides, in Barak and Arafat, had leaders who were as flexible as
they were likely to get. During 20 years, he said, Jews and Arabs
had learned that ``we are all humans, we all want to live, and we
have to recognize each others' needs.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Kanan, a 36-year-old shopkeeper, waiting at a bus
terminal in the heart of the Old City for his brother to arrive
with his family for a get-together in East Jerusalem, had a crucial
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in traditional Arab dress, with a flowing white robe and
a banded white headdress, he said ordinary Palestinians like
himself could never accustom themselves to getting back parts of
East Jerusalem piecemeal, as Clinton's plan would have required.
``Barak cannot make a deal without conceding control of East
Jerusalem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Palestinian, a 30-year-old resident of the Old City who
was not born when Israel captured it in the 1967 war, overheard
Kanan's remarks and felt that he had not gone far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all rubbish, a waste of time,'' said Ismail Jaber, a bus
driver. ``We must have the Old City back, and if they won't give it
to us now, we won't go away, we'll still be here, they'll still
have to deal with us.'' As if to make his point clearer, he added
that ``it's back to Hamas,'' the radical Islamic group that
detonated bombs in Jerusalem in the Palestinian uprising a decade
ago that was known as the Intifada, and which remains Arafat's most
powerful rival in the areas of Gaza and the West Bank already ceded
to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, before the Damascus Gate in the Old City wall that
leads on to the Dome of the Rock, two other Palestinian men paused
on their way from a pizza supper to evening prayers at the Muslim
shrine. Daoud Abdelhadi, a 44-year-old hairdresser, and Mohanad
Awad, a 43-year-old insurance salesman, both from the
Palestinian-controlled city of Ramallah on the West Bank, were
among the few strollers who appeared not to have heard about the
collapse of the talks, perhaps because they had spent much of the
afternoon on an overcrowded bus journey to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Told that there was to be no peace pact, at least not this time,
they were visibly dismayed. ``It's a bad thing, a very bad thing,''
Abdelhadi said, shaking his head. He described Palestinians as
``tired, so very tired'' by the long years of struggle dating to
the founding of Israel in 1948, and desperate for relief from the
kind of inconveniences he said the two men had faced in making
their journey to Jerusalem. They were forced by Israeli rules, he
said, to come by bus rather than by car, held up for repeated
scrutiny of identity papers at Israeli checkpoints, and denied, in
Abdelhadi's case, the right to bring his 17-year-old son, who
lacked the right papers, to Jerusalem with them.
</P>
<P>
   But after a few minutes of discussion, the two men turned their
frustration not against Barak, nor Arafat, whom they described as
having made the right choice in holding out for broader concessions
on Jerusalem, but against Clinton. ``I'll tell you this,''
Abdelhadi said. ``If the United States wants to do something to
correct the wrongs done to the Palestinian people, it can do it, no
problem, it has the power over Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Awad agreed. ``I want to ask you,'' he said, ``why is America
always on the side of Israel?''

PALESTINIANS SAY THEY WILL DECLARE INDEPENDENCE ON SEPT. 13 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS; see also MIDEAST-ADVISORY-NYT for complete
list of stories.) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Palestinian officials said after the Camp David
summit meeting ended Tuesday without an agreement that they would
press ahead with plans to declare an independent state on Sept. 13,
whatever the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The officials asserted that Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, had made all the concessions possible from the Palestinian
side before going into the meeting, and that the firm stance that
he apparently took at Camp David would boost his standing among his
own people. They contended that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel
is responsible for the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will produce full support for Arafat and strengthen his
credibility from the point of view of the Palestinians,'' said
Marwan Barghouti, West Bank leader of Arafat's al-Fatah movement,
the mainstream group in the Palestine Liberation Organization. ``We
have to start to prepare for the declaration of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and Palestinians had set Sept. 13 as a deadline for
a final peace agreement, and Arafat has asserted that he would
declare statehood this year, with or without an accord.
</P>
<P>
   Fatah called for a general strike and demonstrations in support
of Arafat in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Wednesday. That raised
concerns among Israeli army officers that demonstrators might clash
with Israeli soldiers, although Barghouti said that his group would
keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   After months in which Arafat has been accused by domestic
critics of failing to stand up to the Israelis, his apparent
insistence at Camp David on Palestinian sovereignty in East
Jerusalem and on formal recognition of the right of return for
Palestinian refugees was expected to earn him a hero's welcome from
supporters when he returns home.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat ``proved to be one of the last of the historic leaders,
because he said no at the moment when no one says no to America,''
said Freih Abu Meddein, the justice minister in Arafat's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sheik Ahmad Yassin, the spiritual leader of the militant
Islamic movement Hamas, had words of praise for his political foe.
``I welcome his steadfastness,'' he said in Gaza. ``There is no
choice but the choice of resistance. What was taken by force must
be returned by force.''
</P>
<P>
   Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a top aide to Arafat, accused Barak of
scuttling the talks by insisting on his self-declared ``red
lines.'' These would bar Palestinian sovereignty in East Jerusalem,
formal recognition of the right of return of the refugees and a
full withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped for success, but unfortunately we kept bumping
into these noes, which were the main reason for the crippling of
the peace process,'' Abdel Rahim said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the end of the summit meeting ``doesn't mean that the
peace process will collapse'' Abdel Rahim asserted. ``We are ready
to continue efforts to push the peace process forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Arafat is under mounting pressure from his supporters to
declare a state on Sept. 13, regardless of whether it might provoke
violent confrontation with the Israelis, who have said they would
respond by annexing areas of the West Bank still under Israeli
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will persist in declaring the sovereignty of the
Palestinian state _ our date is September 13,'' said Hani
al-Hassan, a member of Fatah's central committee and a longtime
comrade-in-arms of Arafat. ``We are ready to bear the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials insisted that Arafat had reached the limit of his
concessions even before the Camp David meeting because he had
already recognized Israeli sovereignty over 80 percent of what used
to be British-ruled Palestine and over the western half of
Jerusalem. He could not compromise on what was left: the West Bank,
the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, they said.
</P>
<P>
   By hinting that it was Barak who went the extra mile at Camp
David, President Clinton was taking the Israeli side, Abu Meddein
said. He drew a parallel, contending that Clinton had also placed
the blame on the late Syrian leader, Hafez Assad, after an
unsuccessful meeting several months ago in Geneva to restart
Syrian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Faisal Husseini, the top Palestinian leader in Jerusalem, said
that despite the failure to reach an agreement at Camp David, the
meeting had begun the process of resolving the dispute over the
Holy City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taboo on opening the file of Jerusalem has vanished,'' he
said. ``This file has been opened, and we hope it will generate
more discussion in the Israeli community and that we can reach a
solution before September 13. I don't believe that this is the
end.''

 &HT;    Burnout: Time at premium for kids, and their parents
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it a baseball night? Game or practice? And what time? And
where? Or is this the night for Carolyn Grove to take her daughter
Ryann, 14, to Callanwolde to sing? Or the Alliance Theater for
acting class? Or to cotillion dancing lessons?
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Maybe it's swimming at the YMCA for the boys, 11 and
7. Or Boy Scouts?
</P>
<P>
   Even though Grove uses a computer for other tasks, she resorts
to shuffling through an old-fashioned calendar to keep her life in
some semblance of order. She reckons she spends five hours a day in
her car.
</P>
<P>
   And her dizzily hectic schedule is far from atypical. Millions
of American families are busier than ever, raising concerns that
we're all just another drive-through burger away from burnout.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of parents, life today is like ``Ozzie &AMP; Harriet''
in triple fast forward. It's a blur of hectic travel, meeting
deadlines and keeping up with the Joneses.
</P>
<P>
   But not for everyone. Uprisings by harried parents have begun.
In Wayzata, Minn., a suburb of Minneapolis, parents have formed a
group called Family Life 1st (FamilyLife1st.org). Its mission is to
spark a national backlash that will make parents think twice about
keeping their children so busy. They've urged others involved in
youth activities, such as band directors and ballet teachers, to
work toward the same goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good idea,'' Grove said. ``If there's a logical
medium between the kids having activities and giving the parents
and kids more time ... I'd like to see a group like that in Atlanta
and sit in and see what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury's still out on whether frenetically programming
children's lives is good or bad for them. Or for the parents who
are doing the schlepping.
</P>
<P>
   That will be the subject of future studies. Recent ones suggest
angst-ridden parents don't know whether to feel pride or remorse
about keeping their kids, and themselves, so busy.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad, says Sandra Hofferth, author of a study on
overscheduled children. But there's plenty of evidence, she adds,
that keeping kids jumping has benefits, such as teaching them how
to hustle to get homework done and developing social skills they'll
need later in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that activities like sports affect how well they do on
test scores,'' she says. ``I don't mean to imply that
overscheduling is good, but having some organized activities is
good. Sports provides self-esteem. But I'm concerned that kids
don't have enough downtime, to read or imagine, which is critical
for developing cognitive skills.''
</P>
<P>
   But because 64 percent of families have two wage earners,
parents often feel they have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first generation of youngsters in history whose
parents have had the time and money to do so much for their kids.
</P>
<P>
   And often, it takes lots of money.
</P>
<P>
   Steve and Karen Hughes of Marietta have been traveling all over
the country for years to take son Matt, 17, and daughter Ashley,
14, to tennis and cheerleading competitions, respectively. Karen
even home-schooled Matt for a year because that was the only way
she could juggle the kids' schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``You about need a private secretary,'' Karen says. ``Plus, you
can't forget the deadlines for turning in entries to tournaments
and competitions. It's expensive. But it builds character. And
we're so close because we spend so much time together, and it's
good time, even in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Another positive: TV time for youths 18 and under is decreasing,
having dropped from 15 to 13 hours a week in the past decade or so,
says Hofferth.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Doherty, a University of Minnesota social scientist
and co-founder of the Wayzata group, has written a book,
``Intentional Families,'' which contends that if families don't
make time for each other, they can say goodbye to emotional ties.
</P>
<P>
   Rearing children, he says, has become more like ``product
development,'' and Family Life 1st is ``blowing the whistle on this
problem of scheduled hyperactivity and calling for reclaiming
family time and family activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has received 20 inquiries from across the nation from
parents interested in starting chapters. But Doherty stresses they
are calling for a scaling back, not elimination, of activities.
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine by Dr. Richard Winer, a Roswell psychiatrist, who
urges parents to exercise common sense, not try to ``go back to the
way things were in the 1950s when kids didn't do very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Popkin, a noted Atlanta child psychologist, warns
that generalizing is dangerous; having hectic schedules may do more
good than harm for kids, if not their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids thrive on lots of activity, while others become
stressed out and depressed,'' he says. ``Too little stress can be
as debilitating as too much. Ever been bored to death?''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Reiner, 13, says he'd be depressed if he weren't so
busy. His dad and coach, Michael Reiner, a 47-year-old Atlanta
financial planner, would be, too, though he concedes some people,
like wife Shelly, think he's ``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   He was head coach of two teams in the spring, and now he's
running two all-star squads, both of which practice a couple of
times a week, plus playing one or more games, many far from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are games and practices and tournaments, so basically
four or five nights a week are baseball,'' says Reiner. ``Often
I'll leave the office at 4:30 p.m. and not get home till 11:30. I'm
taking a team soon to Boca Raton (Fla.). But after the second week
of August, I'm done _ until fall ball starts in September. That's
usually over by Halloween, then we start again in February.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, he adds, is ``just my baseball schedule. There's also
lacrosse, and golf lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   But does he worry the kids on his teams might be too busy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that,'' he says. ``It keeps them out of
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the consequences, there's no doubt family time
increasingly is being spent in the car. Due to urban sprawl, the
metro area leads the nation in miles driven per person per day,
according to the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Washington-based Surface Transportation
Policy Project found that the average mom spends 17 days a year
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   But breadwinner fathers also have less time than most people
think, says a Canadian study. They're working longer, then rushing
to help their wives meet commuting deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Arranging her schedule this week by cellphone, Grove conceded
she's often not sure what she's supposed to do on any given day.
But daughter Ryann is grateful for her mom's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been doing it so many years, it's a way of life now.''

 &HT;    Four Pensacola spots rate with different strokes for sandy folks
 &HT;    By Howard Pousner

<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ When Perdido Key's shoreline made the annual
top 20 list of American beaches compiled by the expert who bills
himself as ``Dr. Beach,'' we just had to check it out.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time we got here, we were certainly ready for an
award-winning splash, having fought through Panama City and
Destin's tangled traffic, in stupefying heat and humidity, from our
vacation spot on the Panhandle's lower-key eastern end. The
temperature according to one bank sign near the beach: 103 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Only problem was, when we finally got to the Perdido Key State
Recreation Area, the main public beach access, things hardly seemed
golden. Black flies were on the attack. The park's amenities were
spartan, not much more than litter-blemished boardwalks leading
from the parking lot to the beach, grim restrooms and some picnic
pavilions. Even the usually gorgeous Gulf of Mexico was a thick and
chunky soup of seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Beach, we figured, had done some of his computations at the
nearby Flora-Bama Lounge, the legendary dive on the Florida-Alabama
line where the big fun includes an annual mullet toss competition.
</P>
<P>
   We were unwowed by Perdido Key, but undaunted. We decided to
spend the next day doing a totally unscientific survey of how it
ranks among Pensacola's other beaches. We may not have a doctorate
in beachology, but we know a nice stretch of sand when we see it.
</P>
<P>
   GULF ISLANDS NATIONAL SEASHORE
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Printed slogan or boast: ``A place of myriad riches.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accuracy of that claim: Truth in advertising! Heading west
from Pensacola Beach along Santa Rosa Island, we quickly witnessed
a sign of nature's unsullied magic: a halo of sand blowing over the
road on the horizon. We were entering a pristine, 7.7-mile stretch
of federally protected shoreline that leads to Fort Pickens, an
imposing brick edifice completed in 1834. (This is but a small
section of the national seashore, a series of barrier islands
stretching 150 miles along the gulf, from Fort Walton Beach, Fla.,
to Ocean Springs, Miss.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  High tide (highlights): Most of the hooks were coming up empty
on the pier by the fort, but we saw a sea gull nab a fish out of
the water and, in midair, go chomp! ... Retreating to the quiet
Langdon Beach area, we followed a winding boardwalk from the
parking area through scrub and over sea-oat dotted dunes to _voila!
_the most perfect stretch of shoreline we could imagine. ... Blue
and jade bands of gulf waters that up close were so clear you could
watch the minnows darting about. ... A wide beach with sand as
white as Dixie Crystals. ... A glorious, unobstructed gulf view.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Low tide (lowlights): Not many places to grab refreshments,
but if you wanted to snorkel beside a 7-Eleven you probably
wouldn't be happy here anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Our unscientific ranking: First. Reminds you how beautiful the
gulf can be when the developers leave it alone.
</P>
<P>
   PERDIDO KEY STATE RECREATION AREA
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Printed slogan or boast: ``Welcome to paradise found''
(actually the Perdido Chamber of Commerce's pitch).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accuracy of that claim: That's not what the tossed mullet
says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  High tide: Beer and other ice-cold beverages and eats are in
close proximity. ... Covered picnic pavilions offer handsome gulf
views and a place to escape the fireball sun. ... If you feel an
uncontrollable urge to be in Alabama, you're almost there. ...
Temporary tattoos are now available at the Flora-Bama Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Low tide: The Perdido chamber tourism office could hardly
provide a warm greeting, since it closed 15 minutes before the time
on the door said it was supposed to. ... Development, especially
the muy gigantico, Cancun-style condos on the 'Bama side, blots the
gulf panorama. That, and the fact that the state recreation area
parking lots are just off the main drag and awfully close to the
shore, doesn't exactly encourage a communing-with-nature feeling.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Our unscientific ranking: Fourth. Maybe you have to have a pad
in one of those 'Bama towers to really appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   BIG LAGOON STATE RECREATION AREA
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Printed slogan or boast: ``The real Florida'' (actually the
slogan of the entire state park system).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accuracy of that claim: Nothing Mickey Mouse about this place
_ thankfully. You certainly get a lot with your beach _ a 698-acre,
family-friendly park that includes slash pine woodlands, salt
marshes bordering Big Lagoon, nature trails, countless birds and
other fauna to train binoculars on, an observation tower
overlooking the lagoon, five picnic pavilions, boat ramps and
camping facilities.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  High tide: The East Beach is barely wide enough to throw down
a beach towel, but the shallow lagoon waters are filled with sea
life, including tons of hermit crabs squatting in seashells of all
sorts. It's a meditative place where it's easy to pass an hour or
more with your head down trying to spot marine life in the swaying
marsh grass.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Low tide: The meditative mood can be broken by noisy boats and
jet skis detouring over from the Intracoastal. ... The park ranger
at the entrance offered no insight or even a brochure, only the
encouragement to ``Have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Our unscientific ranking: Second. We did have fun _ and would
gladly return.
</P>
<P>
   PENSACOLA BEACH
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Printed slogan or boast: ``World's whitest beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accuracy of that claim: Hard to tell, with all those
washboard-stomached, cigarette-dragging, teenage hunks and hotties
in the way.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  High tide: Parents, do you know where your teens are? Here!
This entire scene is ready for an MTV close-up, or maybe Discovery
channel could do an expose: ``Secrets of the Hormonally
Hyperdriven.'' ... Those nice, young, tattooed men sure are helpful
_ holding down the shower fixture levers so that the bikinied
ladies have both hands free to wash the sand off their suntanned
bods. How sweet! ... Those Florida Seminole insignia coolers seem
to hold an unending supply of Bud Lights. ... Lots of food and
drink places in the nearby Quietwater Beach and Boardwalk complex,
including a Hooters. Have we spotted a trend?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Low tide: Any visitor on the far side of 20 will instantly
feel older than the Queen Mother. ... Have to be careful not to get
flattened by the jacked-up cars and pickups in the parking lot. ...
This overpopulated beach has been virtually denuded of plant life
by wildlife of the two-legged variety.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Our unscientific ranking: Third, unless you're in the MTV
demographic (if you are, there is no other beach).
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Take I-85 south to Montgomery, then follow I-65
south to U.S. 31 south to U.S. 29 to I-10. Go east on I-10 to
I-110, then south into Pensacola. It's about a five-hour drive.
</P>
<P>

CONCORDE: EXPENSIVE PLANE, EXPENSIVE TRIP, SUPER LUXURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an engineering marvel and an economic millstone. It
symbolized the zenith of luxury at a time when the pleasures of air
travel are at a nadir. And, until Tuesday, the Concorde had an
unblemished safety record.
</P>
<P>
   Able to fly across the Atlantic in three and half hours,
cruising more than 10 miles above the earth at twice the speed of
sound, the Concorde, with its $10,000 round-trip tickets, is the
conveyance of choice for the super-rich and super-powerful.
</P>
<P>
   While Air France and British Airways _ the only two airlines to
fly the supersonic airplane _ can eke out a profit on the plane
through shrewd marketing and chartering the airplane for about
$40,000 an hour, the plane's development cost was a staggering $21
billion in current dollars, all of it bankrolled by French and
British taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Only 16 planes were ever made. Thirteen were in commercial use
until Tuesday. Now, there are 12 _ all grounded after an Air France
Concorde, filled with German tourists, crashed just after takeoff
from Paris Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is a source of great pride to the French and British,
who began collaborating on a supersonic plane in 1962 and intially
saw a market for hundreds of the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest engineering feats involved making the plane reach
speeds approaching and exceeding the speed of sound without having
shock waves disrupt the plane's controls.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde's delta-shaped wing _ a dramatic difference in the
plane's appearance from conventional aircraft _ has no leading edge
or trailing edge flaps that give other commerical aircraft added
lift at lower speeds.
</P>
<P>
   When the Concorde travels at Mach 1 and above, the front edge of
the wings becomes very hot (the nose reaches temperatures of 260
degrees). An irregularity in a leading edge flap could become
superhot, causing it to melt, said aviation specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are no flaps, in order to gain lift, the plane
must take off at a higher speed _ roughly 225 miles per hour _ and
at a much steeper angle than a conventional airplane. Because of
that angle, the needle nose was designed to drop so pilots could
see the runway on takeoff and landing.
</P>
<P>
   While the cause of the crash has not been determined, early
speculation _ bolstered by photographs of flames spewing out of the
underwing engines _ is focusing on an explosive failure of one or
more of the four Rolls Royce SNECMA engines.
</P>
<P>
   If an engine failed and damaged a twin near it, the plane would
have been extremely difficult to control as it struggled to gain
altitude, heavy with fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane is not that easy to control at low speeds, it is not
easy to control in general on approach and landing,'' said John
Hansman, an aeronautics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. ``With an engine failure, you would have asymetric yaw
(engines pushing the plane to turn in one direction instead of
forward) and there is not a lot of rudder on this airplane to
control that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde's first test flight came in 1969, about the same
time Boeing was testing its 747. Boeing was also involved in
developing a supersonic airplane, but never built a prototype.
</P>
<P>
   When the 747 beat the Concorde to the market by six years, and
fuel prices began skyrocketing in the early 1970s, demand for the
Concorde evaporated. The 747 consumed one-fourth the fuel of the
Concorde and carried four times as many passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde's loud engines (it is the noisest commercial
airplane in service) and sonic boom resulted in operating
restrictions in the United States, further diminishing its appeal
to airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Braniff was the only US airline to ever fly the Concorde,
leasing a plane and using it on a route from Washington to Dallas.
But Braniff went bankrupt months later.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials have said because the plane is used only three
or four hours day, it will last much longer than regular planes.
Its extensive and expensive maintenance program _ which recently
uncovered cracks in the wings, and resulted in one British Airways
plane being pulled from service _ will also help the aging airplane
to fly for many more years.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Concorde ages its maintenance costs will keep
soaring; and no new supersonic airplane awaits to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Airplane manufacturers on both side of the Atlantic considered
an international consortium to come up with a replacement. Airbus
started developing its double-decker superjumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and NASA teamed up to develop a high-speed civil
transport capable of carrying 300 passengers at more than twice the
speed of sound and having a range that would make trans-Pacific
routes possible (something the Concorde cannot do).
</P>
<P>
   The US government budgeted more than $2 billion for the NASA
part of the project, but the plug was pulled on it last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could never come up with an environmental solution for
noise and the high-altitude emissions,'' said John Roundhill,
Boeing's vice president of commercial airplane product strategy and
development, in a recent interview. ``We could not make it work for
us based on what we would have to charge.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said development would have cost about $20
billion. And unlike British Aerospace and Aerospatiale, which
jointly developed the Concorde, Boeing would not have been able to
pass the full development costs on to US taxpayers.

 &HT;    `Scary Movie' shapes up as surprise financial hit
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who's the top dog at the movies this summer?
</P>
<P>
   You may think it's ``Mission: Impossible 2'' with its hefty
$209.9 million take so far at U.S. box offices. But consider this:
``M:I2'' cost an estimated $125 million to film, which places its
return on the dollar at about $1.68.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the ratio of money spent to money earned, Keenen Ivory
Wayans' ``Scary Movie'' looks as if it could be the summer's
biggest financial success. Its meager $19 million budget has
translated into $116.4 million in domestic ticket sales. That's a
return on each dollar of $6.13.
</P>
<P>
   At left is a chart of some of this summer's biggest movie
winners and losers (metro Atlanta moviegoers favored the winners,
especially ``Scary Movie'' and ``Big Momma's House'').
</P>
<P>
   But before ``Scary Movie'' fans start boasting, remember this:
Summer 2000 has nothing on last year's movies. You recall a scary
little movie called ``The Blair Witch Project''? It cost $350,000
and ultimately earned $140.5 million in domestic sales. That's a
return on the dollar of, ahem, $401.43.
</P>
<P>
   Now you know why the most oft-heard words in Hollywood financial
circles are ``Blair'' and ``witch.''

 &HT;    Cheney's spouse carries conservative credentials of her own
 &HT;    By Gary Susswein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - As Dick Cheney oversaw American troops during
the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s, his wife Lynne was busy
fighting her own battles over the lessons and values taught in
American schools.
</P>
<P>
   More than just a ``politician's wife,'' Lynne Cheney has been an
author, television pundit and, from 1986 to 1993, chairwoman of the
National Endowment for the Humanities, where she began her
controversial efforts to bring conservative values to college
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting the former defense secretary as his running mate
yesterday, Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush also
brought aboard a spouse whose resume evokes Hillary Clinton or
Elizabeth Dole far more than Barbara or Laura Bush _ and whose
background could become a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not one who followed (her husband) on the campaign
trail gazing unblinkingly and adoringly during his every
utterance,'' said Oliver Walter, a dean at the University of
Wyoming. ``One thinks of them as Lynne and Dick rather than as the
Cheneys.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials on Tuesday stopped short of trying to sell
Lynne and Dick as a buy-one, get-one-free package - as the Clintons
described themselves in 1992. But they made it clear Lynne Cheney
will play a role in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a woman of many accomplishments,'' Bush said. ``Lynne is
an incredibly important member of this team, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues describe the Casper, Wyo., native as
bright, personable and quick-witted. They say she's as well-versed
in many public policy issues as her husband.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps more controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who has a doctorate in British literature, drew fire
from some academics during her tenure at the National Endowment,
which distributes grant money for research projects. Critics
accused her of injecting politics into the agency and supporting
programs that reflected her conservative views.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney vetoed funding for a movie that said Christopher Columbus
had committed genocide in the Western Hemisphere. She appointed a
panel to develop standards for American history students _ then
blasted the standards because they placed as much emphasis on
African and Native American contributions to American society as on
European contributions.
</P>
<P>
   She has criticized schools for de-emphasizing Shakespeare and
other Western classics. And last year, she supported the Texas
Board of Education's decision to introduce phonics-based reading
over the objections of some educators and parents who felt it
suppressed critical thinking skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly Lynne Cheney's activities mean she's extremely
well-connected and well-regarded in the religious right
community,'' said Sam Smoot of the Texas Freedom Network, a
religious right watchdog group. ``As the vice president's wife, she
would have a national platform and would use it to promote her
political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters see Cheney's ``agenda'' as a necessary
counteroffensive to the so-called politically-correct values they
say have become popular on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is deeply interested in the academic health and
intellectual life of the country,'' said Anne Neal, former general
counsel of the National Endowment for the Humanities who works with
Cheney at the conservative American Council of Trustees and Alumni.
</P>
<P>
   That interest could make her more popular among some voters this
November than either her husband or Bush, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynne, because the reputation she gained at Humanities, is
seen more as a conservative ideologue - thus appealing to the right
wing of the party,'' said Walter.

FLAMES, THEN SHOCK AND DISBELIEF FOR WITNESSES TO AIR FRANCE
CRASH

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROISSY, France _ Witnesses described the brief, fiery flight of
AF 4590 as a vision of hell or a kind of bomb, in flames from the
time it rolled down the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport until
it smashed three minutes later into a tiny, wooden hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like some bomb taking off,'' said John Palmerston, an
Australian who saw the plane take off from the airport here. ``The
whole back end of the plane was on fire. I thought it was going to
crash right here at the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   In the little town of Gonesse, barely four miles southwest of
the airport, there were reactions of shock and distress. ``It was
truly a hell, there were flames everywhere,'' a witness told French
television channel LCI. ``There were pieces of the fuselage over
more than 200 meters, pieces of plastic, of cloth, bits of metal,
pieces of the wing, rivets. As for the hotel, there is nothing
left; it was blown to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   According to authorities, 109 people died on the airplane, and
four more on the ground, apparently in the Hotelissimo hotel. A
huge cloud of gray and black smoke surged into the sky, visible for
at least 10 miles.
</P>
<P>
   For Fabien Tillon, trying to manage the crisis from the offices
of the local authorities in Cergy-Pontoise, the first crash of a
Concorde was also a terrible blow to French pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big national shock,'' he said, as he tried to handle
two telephones and a cigarette. ``Many people died, but the symbol
of the Concorde, too. The Concorde is a huge national idea for
France, a symbol of engineering pride, and the fact that the
Concorde crashed, and so many people died, and on the soil of
France, it's a terrible shock.''
</P>
<P>
   The elegant, needle-nosed Concorde, the world's first supersonic
passenger plane, was developed by the French and the British in the
1960s as a kind of response to the U.S. and Soviet technological
competition, another version of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   It also served to heal some wounds left by France's veto in
December 1967 of British membership in the Common Market, now the
European Union _ hence the name of the plane. In more than 20 years
of commercial flying, however uneconomical and however noisy, the
Concorde had never crashed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Firemen placed traffic cones across a blackened field,
apparently marking the places where charred bodies were found.
``Once you got used to looking through the smoke, the horror hits
you,'' an emergency worker who had been at the scene told Agence
France-Presse. ``By the dozens, bodies, or pieces of bodies,
horribly mutilated. Here and there, shoes, books, parts of
suitcases that are wasted away.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hotel, another witness told French television that
onlookers had smashed a window and tried to get into the building,
but the victims inside were already dead. ``There was nothing we
could do.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one guest jumped out the window to safety, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
   Extraordinarily, it seemed, another hotel nearby, Les Relais
Bleus, was untouched. ``I thought the plane was going to land on my
desk,'' the owner told Europe 1 radio. ``I saw it heading for me in
flames. I just let go of the telephone and ran.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tillon said his staff was unbelieving at first. ``Frankly, when
we heard the news, we thought it was some kind of joke or an
emergency exercise,'' he said. ``And then we had confirmation that
the Concorde had crashed and presumably everyone was dead. It
really came like a blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Frechet, who worked in the normal flight path of the
Concorde and told Agence France-Presse that he flew on the
supersonic plane last December, said there had been growing fear of
a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew something like this would happen one day,'' Frechet
said. ``There is just too much traffic at Charles de Gaulle. There
is no zone for any plane to get rid of its fuel if had the
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Tourbon, a Frenchwoman flying Tuesday from Charles de
Gaulle, echoed the normal sense of pride felt when a Concorde is
spotted in the air. ``It always excites me to see one,'' she said.
``It makes me proud. It's awful what's happened.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tillon described the ``red plan'' for national emergencies that
went smoothly into operation in his department, Val d'Oise, which
governs Gonesse. More than 200 firefighters were soon on the scene,
along with 110 policemen and 80 gendarmes, 13 ambulances, three
helicopters, the prefect and the prime minister, Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   But even as more emergency workers arrived, their vehicles
blocking the roads, there wasn't much to save, Tillon said. The
passengers all appeared to have died, and after the fire was put
under control, there came the grisly task of bagging the dead and
taking them to the line of waiting hearses.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, there was a large explosion, then, barely a second
later, another large explosion,'' an office worker said. ``We went
to the window, and the flames were higher than the trees. When we
went outside, pieces were falling down on us.'' One piece of metal
fell on the roof of a colleague's car, the worker said.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness told French television: ``I heard the noise,
because each time the Concorde flies over, I always have a look. I
saw it coming with an engine on fire, it tried to turn on its left,
then it fell and fell onto the hotel.''

 &HT;    Cheney's voting record has no left turns
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You won't find any dead armadillos or yellow
stripes on Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Bush's running mate has a congressional voting
record full of right turns and no drift across the middle of the
road _ where Texas liberal commentator Jim Hightower says only dead
critters and highway stripes are found.
</P>
<P>
   After Bush introduced Cheney as his running mate Tuesday, the
two did not dampen the pep rally atmosphere at the Frank Erwin
Special Events Center by fielding questions on how relevant
Cheney's voting record will be in the Bush's campaign of
compassionate conservatism. The Democrats are sure to try to paint
the Bush-Cheney ticket as too right wing to win, but Bush's
campaign aides swatted aside those suggestions after Tuesday's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Albert Gore wants to suggest that this campaign be
conducted over somebody's voting record in the 1970s and 1980s,
we're happy to engage him,'' said Karl Rove, Bush's campaign
strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Few political observers expect the issue to stick. After all, as
University of Texas political science professor Bruce Buchanan
said, ``It's the top guy, not the second guy, who sets the tone of
the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cheney, who represented Wyoming from 1979 until 1989,
likely will have to explain some of his votes.
</P>
<P>
   He supported income tax cuts, incentives for businesses and
increases in military spending that would fit nicely in a Bush
agenda. He also was one of eight lawmakers to oppose the Clean
Water Act of 1987 and fought more funding for the Endangered
Species Act and ``Superfund'' cleanups.
</P>
<P>
   He championed opening wilderness areas to more petroleum
exploration until drillers targeted lands near Wyoming's
Yellowstone National Park. He favored money for President Reagan's
Star Wars missile defense while wanting less money for Head Start.
He opposed gun control, supported school prayer and voted against
abortion rights, including measures that prohibited abortions even
in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life was endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights, in particular, is a litmus issue for a core of
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The selection of Richard Cheney as Governor Bush's running
mate is a slap in the face of every American woman and the men who
care about them,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned
Parenthood Action Fund. On the other side, Carol Long Tobias,
director of the National Right to Life Political Action Committee,
praised the Cheney selection: ``Mr. Cheney had a one hundred
percent pro-life voting record during his time in office and will
be a great asset to the Republican ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center
for Governmental Studies, said Cheney could use a couple of tactics
to slip criticism of his congressional record.
</P>
<P>
   First, he can blame Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can say, 'I was representing my constituents in Wyoming.
Since my years in Congress, I've modified my views,''' Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   Or Sabato said Cheney can take the traditional route for a vice
presidential candidate and just disappear into the background of
the campaign. For years, Cheney's low-key personality has moderated
his public image. He has never been confused for the controversial
Newt Gingrich in style, although he could match him in votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a human being created to fade in the background,
it's Dick Cheney,'' Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, the Bush campaign will emphasize Cheney's last turn
on the political stage as Secretary of Defense during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the America people have seen Dick Chaney on a world
stage in a decision-making role,'' said Linda Divall, a GOP
political consultant. ``I don't think Dick Cheney's voting record
in the 1980s will be relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public
Affairs at Millersville University in Pennsylvania, said the
Democrats will find plenty in Cheney's record with which to attack.
</P>
<P>
   As the latest New York Times/CBS poll finds the race tightening,
it also finds voters shaping their opinions about Bush and his
Democratic opponent, Al Gore. A majority find Bush more likely to
reduce taxes and consider him a strong leader, while a majority
believe Gore is more likely to protect abortion rights, improve the
environment and make health care affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, the Gore campaign will likely try to use
Cheney to paint the GOP ticket as too conservative on certain
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna said the Bush campaign probably can explain some of
Cheney's votes by putting them in context. Some of the votes are 20
years old and the issues have changed. For example, in an era of
budget surpluses does Cheney's support of a balanced budget
amendment mean anything to voters? Madonna doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   He said some social issues _ Cheney's opposition to the Equal
Rights Amendment for women _ might strike a chord with women
voters. That, Madonna said, probably would be the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not going to live and die on the vice president's
record,'' he said. ``In the end, it's going to be about Gore and
Bush.''

 &HT;    Train film plot might derail newcomers
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's just like big TV,'' said the young tyke across the aisle
from me at the screening of ``Thomas and the Magic Railroad.''
Turns out he's dead right.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone over 6 or unindoctrinated in the immensely successful
British TV series created by filmmaker Britt Allcroft in the early
1980s, ``Thomas,'' the tale of a plucky Tank Engine who talks and
rolls his eyes, will come off as, well, The Little Engine That
Couldn't. But for tot-sized fans or, for that matter, anyone of any
age who's just plain train-crazy, ``Thomas'' may have something to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   The movie takes place on the Island of Sodor, a magical land of
anthropomorphic trains that's somehow connected to an idyllic
little village named Shining Time. A diminutive sprite known as Mr.
Conductor (Alec Baldwin following in the footsteps of TV's Ringo
Starr and George Carlin) travels between these two worlds, looking
after both as best he can.
</P>
<P>
   Things start to go wrong when Thomas and his loquacious
locomotive pals are threatened by a bully known as Diesel 10. Next,
Mr. Conductor starts losing his sparkle, i.e., the glittery power
by which he can travel between Sodor and Shining Time.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that much I got. But then this so-called kids' movie got
more convoluted than Alain Resnais' ``Last Year at Marienbad.''
There's something about a lonely widower (Peter Fonda, giving a
lovely performance under difficult circumstances) and a train named
Lady that he's kept hidden in a mountain for years. And something
about Diesel 10's determination to find Lady and destroy her. And
something about how Mr. Conductor and his surf's-up cousin (Michael
E. Rodgers) desperately need to replenish their sparkle. And
something about Fonda's spirited granddaughter (Mara Wilson) who
dares to take the journey between Shining Time and Sodor. And
something about Thomas' need to prove that little trains can ``do
big things.''
</P>
<P>
   Please keep in mind that my 3-year-old consultant, Charlie, who
likes the series, had no trouble keeping up with the story, though
he did think Diesel was a little scary. But frankly, I was as lost
as most people are when dragged to a production of ``Timon of
Athens.'' Then again, unlike the family I followed into the parking
lot, no one is planning to give me a Thomas train for my birthday.
</P>
<P>
   So, take the kids and take a chance. Or take off for a little
mall-crawling while they enjoy themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' isn't a wreck, but you really
don't want to be railroaded into seeing it, either, unless you've
got no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas and the Magic Railroad''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alec Baldwin and Peter Fonda. Directed by Britt
Allcroft. Rated G. 1 hour, 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Doesn't always stay on track.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Ringel Gillespie writes for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.

TV NOTES: O.J. SIMPSON; `EARLY SHOW'; NICK AT NITE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 C.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson: More Debates
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson, who is in the midst of a publicity push for his
new Web site, is quickly becoming the hot potato of the television
news industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week ``The View,'' after booking Simpson for an interview
that was to take place Wednesday, canceled it amid complaints from
viewers and staff members who did not think Simpson should appear
on the syndicated program.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Monday, after originally agreeing to interview Simpson
for Tuesday's edition of NBC's ``Today,'' Matt Lauer, the program's
co-host, alerted producers that he did not want to take part in the
segment. Executives said he came to that decision after considering
over the weekend whether to do the interview. It was instead done
by his co-host, Katie Couric.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't feel comfortable doing it,'' said Jeff Zucker, the
executive producer of ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said that he allowed Lauer to excuse himself from the
Simpson interview duty because ``my position, since Day 1, since
I've been here, has been that I'd never put somebody in a position
of doing an interview they don't feel comfortable doing.'' Couric,
he added, had no objection to doing the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' executives did not offer many particulars on Lauer's
reasons, other than to indicate that he had expressed a personal
aversion to the Simpson subject and raised questions about the
newsworthiness of the interview, in which Simpson was certain to
plug his new Web site (as he did).
</P>
<P>
   For $9.95, the Web site, AskOJ.com, allows users to pose
questions to Simpson, who was acquitted in the murders of his
ex-wife, Nicole, and her friend Ron Goldman but was later found
liable in a wrongful-death civil suit. The site also sells
memorabilia relating to Simpson's football career.
</P>
<P>
   Lauer had plenty of company in refusing to do the interview. The
producers of ABC's ``Good Morning America'' and CBS's ``Early
Show'' _ both competitors of ``Today'' _ said they also declined to
have Simpson on their programs.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Friedman, senior executive producer of the ``Early Show,''
which has Bryant Gumbel as co-host, said he declined because his
interview with Simpson would have come after the one scheduled for
``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I declined because we couldn't have him first,'' Friedman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Ross, the executive producer of ``Good Morning
America,'' said she declined to have Simpson on her program because
she does not believe he will offer any new information on his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is just never going to advance the story,'' said
Ross, who was in charge of all prime time news magazine coverage of
Simpson's criminal trial for ABC News. ``To have him come in and
promote a Web page, that's something that is underneath the limbo
pole of taste for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zucker said he believed that Couric's interview with Simpson
did break some new ground. For instance, she presented Simpson with
a statement from Camp Goodtimes, one of the charities to which
Simpson has said he will donate the profits from his Web site, that
said: ``We have not given approval to Mr. Simpson or his
representatives to use our name.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Zucker said, he believed the interview made for
``good journalism and good television.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few days ago, Lauer disclosed to television journalists
gathered in Pasadena, Calif., that he had fought, loudly, with
Zucker earlier this year, when he was asked to do more than one
interview with Darva Conger, the bride from Fox's ill-fated ``Who
Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire.'' However, Lauer said, he did
not refuse the assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Is Lauer developing an attitude? Not at all, Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that people feel comfortable enough to speak up,'' he
said. ``That's the hallmark of an open and professional
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson's television publicity tour is scheduled to continue
today. He is to appear on Court TV's ``Crier Today'' and on the Fox
News Channel, which was forced to cancel separate appearances with
the anchors Paula Zahn and Linda Vester on Tuesday. Those are
scheduled to run Wednesday, instead.
</P>
<P>
   Roger E. Ailes, the Fox News Channel chairman and chief
executive, said that because of Tuesday's crash of a Concorde jet
outside Paris, he believed it would have been inappropriate to go
ahead with them Tuesday, though he said he expects that they will
be newsworthy in their own right. Simpson is also scheduled to
appear on CNN's ``Burden of Proof'' Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   `Early' Is Surviving
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, the producers of CBS's ``Early Show,'' which
made its debut in the fall, say they believe they are finally
making gains in the morning television ratings race.
</P>
<P>
   The morning program, which is shown from 7 to 9, is still a
distant third in the ratings behind its competitors, NBC's
``Today'' and ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' But it is getting a
nice bump, apparently because of the popularity of CBS's new
prime-time reality shows, ``Survivor,'' which has proven to be a
smash hit, and ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the program _ with Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson as
co-hosts _ was watched in 2.1 million households, more than in any
other week since March. That is considered a feat because the
summer is traditionally the slowest time of the year in the
television business.
</P>
<P>
   The program also seems to be making real gains among women ages
18 to 49. About 30 percent more women tuned into CBS between 7 a.m.
and 9 a.m. last week than did during that time period last year,
when CBS was running ``This Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly `Big Brother' and `Survivor' have given us a
boost,'' said Friedman, the senior executive producer. ``They've
opened the door, and we've kept them in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The ratings represent the best news Friedman has had in a while.
The program has been slow to take off with viewers and had been
struggling to draw a higher audience than the show it had replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Nick at 15
</P>
<P>
   Nick at Nite, which takes over for the Nickelodeon cable network
at night, turned 15 this month. Since July 1985, from 9 p.m. to
5:30 a.m., it has been showing reruns of old sitcoms like ``Happy
Days,'' ``The Brady Bunch'' and ``All in the Family.'' Watched in
1.4 million households each night, it has become the
fourth-highest-rated channel in prime time on cable, after the USA,
TBS and TNT networks, which are helped in the ratings by sports or
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Nick at Nite will celebrate its birthday on Sunday with an
anniversary special in which television producers from the days of
old like Sherwood Schwartz (``The Brady Bunch,'' ``Gilligan's
Island'') introduce their favorite episodes.

DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH NEEDED TO MAKE PATRIOTS SPARKLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ The Patriots are not the Redskins, Ravens,
Titans, and Jaguars, teams that have some of the best pure talent
in the NFL. They are a team with a few stars, a few players who
have been All-Pro, but a team that must find a diamond in the rough
before the start of the season if they are to pull it together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Belichick will do this,'' said an AFC executive. ``He'll
bring young free agents in and turn one or two of them into
players. You watch, there'll be someone who makes that team and
plays a prominent role that has come out of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In this day of highly specialized scouting, few players slip
through the cracks and become great NFL players. Belichick brought
up the name Laroi Glover Tuesday as an example of a player nobody
knew much about but who learned to play for Jack Bicknell in
Barcelona a few years ago and is now an All-Pro for the New Orleans
Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then there is a late bloomer, such as Chad Eaton,
or a player who improves by leaps and bounds every year, such as
cornerback Kato Serwanga, a perfect example of what Belichick is
trying to find.
</P>
<P>
   Serwanga, who was signed as a free agent in 1998 during the
Bobby Grier regime, figures heavily in Belichick's thinking. In
camp, he is taking most of the reps on the first team, alongside Ty
Law. If Belichick doesn't give the nod to Antonio Langham, a former
Cleveland Browns draft pick of his, Serwanga appears to be in line
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kato had a slow start in the spring and missed a number of
practices,'' said Belichick, ``but he's come back and had a solid
camp. He has to earn his spot. He'll have to beat out Tebucky
(Jones), Antonio Langham, and fifth-round pick Antwan Harris, but
he's in the running to be a good player for us. He's got a good
work ethic and he understands team defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Another such player could be Marc Megna, a former nose tackle
from the University of Richmond who went to New York Jets camp last
year and switched to middle linebacker before being cut. He was
picked up by the Patriots and switched to outside linebacker. A
high-motor player who never stops working to improve, Megna could
wind up being a top special teams player or even a superb pass
rusher like Chris Slade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's way ahead of the game,'' said Belichick. ``I don't see
him beating out Chris Slade, but he's come so far since I first saw
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the place where the Patriots need the biggest diamond
is the offensive line. Center Damien Woody is basically the
grizzled veteran of this group after one year on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are starting Adam Davis, a free agent rookie from
Oklahoma State, at right guard in place of injured Todd Rucci.
Davis, 6 feet 4 inches and 300 pounds, started 37 games at Oklahoma
State and helped his team average 311 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Grimes, a rookie free agent from Alabama, has performed
well at defensive end subbing for the injured Brandon Mitchell. He
appears to be quite athletic, a 6-4, 290-pounder who played against
tough competition for the Crimson Tide.
</P>
<P>
   Another player drawing some attention is receiver Shockmain
Davis, a 6-foot, 205-pound rookie free agent. Davis was a teammate
of Michael Bishop at Blinn (Texas) Junior College before
transferring to Angelo State, where he caught 67 passes for 1,120
yards (16.7-yard average). He seems to have the same attributes as
Tony Simmons, strength and speed.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard tight end Chris Eitzmann shows interesting ability, as
does offensive lineman Ryan Tujague.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Belichick brought 26 rookie free agents into camp. He
has weeded some out but remains very interested in some of the
players mentioned above.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had such severe salary cap issues that they weren't
able to add depth by signing veterans. Their draft picks have added
little thus far. Second-rounder Adrian Klemm, an offensive tackle
from Hawaii, will miss all of camp following major knee surgery;
running back J.R. Redmond, their third-rounder, is coming off groin
surgery and a holdout; and fifth-rounder Dave Stachelski, a tight
end from Boise State, has had one injury after another.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the injury situation hadn't opened the door for
unheralded players to step up, Belichick's method is to give the
Megnas, Grimeses, and Davises of the world a chance.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't find his diamond in the rough, the Patriots may be
in for a long season. The attitude might be better and the schemes
more creative, but no coach can win without good players. Now
Belichick must get a little lucky.

   GIVE UP YOUR SEATS
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are cleaning out our basement, selling a few yard-sale
items and giving others to charity, including two child-safety car
seats built five years ago. At that time, they met all safety
standards, but they fall short of today's stricter standards. Is it
ethical to sell them? To give them away? What if a warning is
provided? _
</P>
<P>
   Jack Cushman, Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your intentions are honorable, but at least two of your
yard-sale choices are ill-advised. There is something unseemly
about selling subpar baby seats to the poor (or the overly frugal):
surely we don't want a society with one set of safety standards for
those with money and a set of inferior standards for those without.
</P>
<P>
   Giving away your car seat might remove the taint of financial
gain, and providing a warning allows the recipient to make an
informed decision. He's made the wrong decision, however, if he
decides to use the car seats, according to Liz Neblett of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Besides today's
stricter standards, ''the Juvenile Product Manufacturers
Association recommends that seats not be used after six years, and
some manufacturers have adopted a five-year standard because of the
possible degradation of material,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be swayed by the argument that an inferior car seat is
preferable to none, either. ''There are organizations in almost
every state that make seats available free or at reduced prices to
those who truly can't afford them,'' Neblett says.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, as standards are upgraded for products, we needn't
discard all of our old stuff. For example, you might ethically sell
a used car that lacks air bags. But in this case the federal
highway agency's position is wise, car seats being relatively
inexpensive and children being relatively fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of the references I used in a job application is my
former boss, whom I am now dating. We were not romantically
involved while we worked together, and she says our current
involvement has no bearing on the recommendation she would give me.
Am I obliged to reveal our relationship to my potential employer? _
Anonymous, Boston
</P>
<P>
   A: Even with a sincere determination to be punctilious, your
former boss faces a conflict of interest in writing a reference for
someone she has seen naked. If no one else at the old firm is in a
position to write you a recommendation, then she may write it, but
she should acknowledge your personal connection and leave it to
your potential employer to gauge its effect on her comments. Her
disclosure can be brief (''As someone I have known both personally
and professionally. . . .'') and need not extol your kissable lips
or that funny way you crinkle your eyes at a moment of passion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I got home with a new drill, I discovered that the
salesperson had given me a box that held three smaller boxes, each
containing a drill. When I returned it, that salesperson begged me
not to report him, saying: ''I have been selling them like this all
day. If the boss finds out, I will be fired.'' I left with three
drills. He started restacking the display with single drill boxes.
Did I do the right thing? _ Ronald R. Graham, Elmhurst, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not exactly. While you do not have to report the clerk to his
boss - his mistake was an honest one, and it can't be undone now -
that does not mean you get three drills for the price of one.
Surely a way can be found to return two of them without costing the
clerk his job. Can't he slip them back into the display? One
caution: if rectifying the situation involves hiding a power drill
in your pants, be insanely careful with the on-off switch.

STOCKS ADVANCE, LED BY SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The main stock market gauges rose for the first time
in three sessions Tuesday, led by solid gains in big semiconductor
companies like Intel and Applied Materials.
</P>
<P>
   But the rise in prices was far from uniform. On the New York
Stock Exchange, the ratio of stocks that rose to those that lost
value was about even.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty lackluster session, but at least we finished
in the green,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at
Prudential Securities. ``The one positive was a rebound in
semiconductor stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.85 points, or 0.1
percent, to 10,699.97, led by Intel, Wal-Mart and Procter &AMP; Gamble
.
</P>
<P>
   Gains in Cisco Systems and Nortel Networks helped to lift the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index by 10.18 points, or 0.7 percent,
to 1,474.47.
</P>
<P>
   And the Nasdaq composite index gained 48.00 points, or 1.21
percent, to 4,029.57.
</P>
<P>
   Over the previous two sessions, the Nasdaq had fallen 4.9
percent on concern that profit growth would slow in the third and
fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Chip-related stocks rallied after the Semiconductor Equipment
Association of Japan said sales soared 126 percent in May. That
report followed stronger-than-expected earnings from Texas
Instruments, which posted its results after the market closed on
Monday and painted a bright outlook for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Among chip stocks, Intel gained 2~, to 140~. Micron Technology
rose 1}, to 86}. And Applied Materials rose 4, to 84\.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the news on semiconductor sales, there was not much
to impress traders or investors.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan,
offered few insights during semiannual testimony before the House
Banking Committee on whether policy makers will raise short-term
interest rates at its Aug. 22 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of guidance places even greater importance on data that
will be released over the next few weeks, including reports on
second-quarter gross domestic product and the employment cost
index, a key inflation measure. The employment cost index is
scheduled to be released Thursday. And the first estimate of
second-quarter economic growth is expected on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, Greenspan is saying they don't know what they are
going to do on Aug. 22,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst
at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Piskorowski added, ``Greenspan made it plain they are waiting to
see what the data are showing before they will make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug shares were generally weak Tuesday after a report from
Pfizer showed slower-than-expected revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer fell 4[, to 43 11/16. Bristol-Myers Squibb lost 1 5/16,
to 48|. Schering-Plough dropped 1 61/64, to 43 5/16. And Eli Lilly
slipped 9/64, to 101.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com was another loser. Shares of the Internet retailer
fell 1[, to 37|, after the company said Joseph Galli, its president
and chief operating officer, was leaving to become chief executive
of VerticalNet Inc. Galli had held those positions for only a year.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters Group , the financial information provider, rose 3}, to
119\, after it reported that first-half earnings soared 75 percent,
in large part because of higher revenue from Instinet, its online
trading network.
</P>
<P>
   But MedQuist tumbled 12], or 40 percent, to 18 13/16, after the
medical records transcriber reported operating profits that were
weaker than expected. &QL;

TWO-YEAR-OLDS TO BE FEATURED AT RENEWED SARATOGA 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ They called it Horse Haven when racing
was inaugurated at Saratoga Springs in 1863 for a meet that lasted
three days. But the next year, the ``new'' Saratoga Race Course
opened on Union Avenue. And on Wednesday, for the 132nd year, it
will open for racing again, starting a prestigious six-week
schedule that will feature 35 stakes races carrying purses of $8.7
million along with historic reminders that the stately old track
has also grown to become ``the Graveyard of Champions.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same oval where Man o' War lost his only race in the
Sanford Stakes 80 years ago, seven 2-year-old fillies will take the
spotlight on opening day in the Schuylerville, followed one day
later by juvenile colts in the Sanford. They will be the first
brace of races for 2-year-olds at Saratoga, where horses begin
careers and strengthen their claims to championships.
</P>
<P>
   The opening-day crowd will be greeted by $3.5 million in
renovations that were performed without altering the country style
of the old track. They include new jockeys quarters inside a quaint
colonial building dating to 1890, new entrances to the clubhouse
and grandstand, irrigation systems for the Oklahoma turf training
course, dormitory upgrades on the backside and the replacement of
1,275 seats in a remodeled grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   But one change will be made on the track. D. Wayne Lukas, who
has won 5 Schuylervilles, 5 Sanfords and 27 stakes for juveniles
overall at Saratoga, will not have a filly in the opening-day
feature. But he will be represented through his extended family, so
to speak. Mark Hennig, one of several former assistants to Lukas,
will enter an all-star pair, Gold Mover, with Craig Perret riding,
and With Ability, with Jerry Bailey riding, and they will go to the
gate as solid favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Hennig also trains a third star juvenile filly, Raging Fever,
who will wait for her chance on stage later in the meet. All three
fillies are owned by Edward P. Evans, the owner of the 2,500-acre
Spring Hill Farm in Virginia, who also bred them. So, Hennig and
Evans can take a clear shot at all three major races for young
fillies at Saratoga: the Schuylerville at six furlongs, the
Adirondack at six and a half furlongs on Aug. 14 and the Spinaway
at seven furlongs on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have a chance to win the first stakes of the
meet, and it's nice to be in a position for the sweep,'' Hennig
said. ``But Saratoga is a funny place. Strange things can happen
here.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to stretch his memory very far back for proof.
Two years ago, the long shot Call Me Up went to the gate at 17-1,
led wire to wire and cruised home the winner in the Schuylerville.
</P>
<P>
   The five other fillies facing Hennig's pair in the Schuylerville
also have great expectations starting with Caught Out, who has
raced twice and won twice at Woodbine in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a filly that wants to run on,'' said Roger Attfield, who
trains Caught Out for Richard Bonnycastle. ``She's got enough class
to win sprinting, but she's not a sprinter. She's definitely
training well enough, and she's ready for this race.''
</P>
<P>
   When the juvenile colts appear on Thursday to complete Round 1
of the 2-year-old series, Lukas will be back on track with Michael
Tabor's Yonaguska. The colt, a son of Cherokee Run, the 1994 sprint
champion, was bought in February for $1.9 million. He won his debut
at Churchill Downs by nine lengths and won his next start at
Belmont in the Flash Stakes, dashing five and a half furlongs in 57
4/5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he's fast,'' Lukas allowed. ``Now the trick is getting
him to relax. We've had 14 different 2-year-old winners this year,
and it's been our most successful summer with them yet. We're very
deep on these colts, and it's too early to tell who's the best.''

COMMENTARY: PRESCRIPTION FOR FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In denouncing President Clinton's plan to extend Medicare
coverage to prescription drugs, and in touting their own
counterproposal, Republicans have rolled out the usual rhetoric.
They excoriate the administration plan as a bureaucratic, ``one
size fits all'' solution. They claim that their plan offers more
choice.
</P>
<P>
   And for once their claims are absolutely right. The Republican
plan does offer more choice. Unfortunately, this is one of those
cases in which more choice is actually bad for everyone. In fact,
by trying to give people more choices the Republican plan would end
up denying them any choice at all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where Democrats want to offer drug coverage directly to Medicare
recipients, the Republicans propose to offer money to private
insurance companies instead, to entice them into serving the senior
market. But all indications are that this plan is a non-starter.
Insurance companies themselves are very skeptical; there haven't
been many cases in which an industry's own lobbyists tell Congress
that they don't want a subsidy, but this is one of them. And an
attempt by Nevada to put a similar plan into effect has been a
complete dud _ not a single insurer licensed to operate in the
state has shown any interest in offering coverage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reason is ``adverse selection'' _ a problem that afflicts
many markets, but insurance markets in particular. Basically,
adverse selection is the reason you shouldn't buy insurance from
companies that say ``no medical exam necessary'': When insurance is
sold to good and bad prospects at the same price, the bad risks
drive out the good. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why can't the elderly buy prescription drug insurance? Suppose
an insurance company were to offer a prescription drug plan, with
premiums high enough to cover the cost of insuring an average
Medicare recipient. It turns out that annual spending on
prescription drugs varies hugely among retirees _ depending on
whether they have chronic conditions, and which ones. Healthy
retirees, who know that their bills won't be that high, would be
unwilling to buy insurance that costs enough to cover the bills of
the average senior _ which means that the insurance plan would
attract only those with above-average bills, meaning higher
premiums, driving still more healthy people away, and so on until
nobody is left. Insurance companies understand this logic very well
_ and are therefore simply not interested in getting into the
market in the first place.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The root of the problem is that private drug insurance could be
offered at a reasonable price only if people had to commit to
paying the necessary premiums before they knew whether they would
need expensive drugs. Such policies cannot be offered if those who
find out later that they don't require such drugs can choose to
stop paying what turn out to be unnecessarily high premiums.
</P>
<P>
   And while in principle one could write a contract that denies
the insured the choice of opting out, just try to imagine the legal
complications if a private company tried to force a healthy retiree
to keep paying high premiums for decades on end, even though he
turns out not to need the company's benefits. As a practical matter
the only way to avoid this opt-out problem, to enforce the kind of
till-death-do-us-part commitment needed to make drug insurance
work, is to make the coverage part of a government program.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of this is more or less textbook economics. So why are
Republican leaders insisting on a plan that almost nobody familiar
with the issue thinks will work? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cynical politics no doubt plays an important role. So does
money; the insurance industry is by and large against the
Republican plan, but the pharmaceutical industry is very anxious to
avoid anything that might push down drug prices, and fears that the
administration plan will do just that. But sincere fanaticism also
enters the picture. Republican leaders in the House, in particular,
are true believers in the miraculous powers of the free market _
they are in effect members of a sect that believes that markets
will work even when the businessmen actually involved say they
won't, and that government involvement is evil even where
conventional analysis says it is necessary.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan is, in short, an assertion of a faith that
transcends mundane economic logic. But what's in it for us
heathens?  &QL;

COMPAQ EARNINGS MEET EXPECTATIONS, DESPITE SLUGGISH PC SHIPMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. reported second quarter earnings Tuesday
that met analysts' estimates, and the company's executives forecast
strong revenue growth in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended June 30, Compaq reported earnings of $387
million, or 22 cents per diluted share, compared with a loss of
$184 million in the comparable period a year ago. Revenues grew by
7 percent to $10.13 billion from $9.42 billion in the second
quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding investment gains of $25 million after tax, Compaq
earned 21 cents per diluted share, equal to the consensus estimate,
according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq reported its results after the close of the market.
Compaq shares closed at $28.1875, up $1.5625, on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's results come after quarterly reports from IDC Corp. and
Dataquest Inc. that showed that PC shipments rose less than
forecast in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   IDC said PC unit shipments in the second quarter rose 14.5
percent from the year-earlier period, below its estimate of 15
percent. Dataquest said global shipments rose 18 percent, below its
forecast for 18.5 percent growth. IDC said U.S. shipments rose 7.2
percent, while Dataquest reported 11.5 percent. Analysts blamed the
slower-than-expected growth on slowing consumer sales and on
shortages of microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole PC sector took a hit from the IDC and Dataquest
numbers coming out, but those were essentially retrospective,''
said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. Compaq ``was
spot on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After stumbling badly two years ago, Compaq has continued to
lose market share, primarily to Dell Computer Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Co. Although Compaq remains the leader worldwide,
it now has has 13.2 percent of the global market, down from 14.3
percent in the year-ago quarter, according to IDC.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq said enterprise computing revenue was $3.4 billion, an
increase of 9 percent year-over-year. Compaq's commercial PC group
reported revenue of $3.3 billion, an increase of just 3 percent
year-over-year, but, more significantly, returned to profitability
in the second quarter. Compaq's consumer group posted revenue of
$1.6 billion, an increase of 32 percent over the prior year period.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter marked the end of Michael Capellas' first year as
Compaq's president and chief executive. Capellas has worked to turn
Compaq around by streamlining manufacturing processes and
rationalizing its product lines. But the company's revenue growth
still pales in comparison to market leaders like Dell in PC's or
Sun Microsystems Inc. in servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to deliver strong, double-digit revenue growth in
the second half of the year,'' Capellas said in a statement. ``I
feel the renewed energy and enthusiasm in our people and their
determination to succeed. I am very confident in our ability to
meet our third quarter and full year objectives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read, said
he thought Compaq would be challenged to meet these goals. ``While
the quarter was on target, they've got to deliver substantial
revenue and earnings gains to meet guidance because Capellas is out
there with these very aggressive promises,'' he said.

 &HT;    Environment, welfare of adolescents recipients of Turner
largesse
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Ted Turner's latest round of international
philanthropy, announced this week in Brazil, focuses largely on two
areas dear to the Atlanta businessman's heart: improving the lives
of adolescent girls and protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Foundation, the organization set up to to
distribute Turner's $1 billion, 10-year gift to U.N.-related
causes, held its board meeting in Rio de Janeiro _ board member

million.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $42 million, about $21 million will be devoted to
improving ``the social and economic situation of adolescent girls
worldwide,'' the foundation said in a statement. Another $6 million
went to environmental projects, including some designed to protect
U.N.-designated ``World Heritage sites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with the U.N., we have developed an exciting program
to help protect some of the world's most important natural
resources,'' Turner, the foundation's chairman, said in the
statement. ``By investing in these incredible World Heritage sites,
we hope to protect these sites for future generations and work with
local communities to demonstrate the economic benefits of
conservation.''
</P>
<P>
   The full list of grants awarded this week is as follows:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $2.9 million over three years to the U.N. Children's Fund

BUSH, AS EXPECTED, NAMES CHENEY TO THE TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ By the time he invited Dick Cheney to his ranch in
early July, Governor George W. Bush had already set aside the idea
of making the former defense secretary his presidential running
mate. He'd put the question to Cheney months earlier, and Cheney,
nearly a decade out of public life, had said no.
</P>
<P>
   But as the two men huddled that July day in a den at the ranch
in Crawford, going over other possible contenders for most of the
morning, Bush had a nagging feeling that his list was incomplete.
They broke for lunch, and as the assembled guests made sandwiches,
Bush confided in his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would really be the best man, if he would do it. I wish
he would,'' Laura Bush recalled her husband as saying on July 3,
according to a senior aide.
</P>
<P>
   That wish came true for the Texas governor Tuesday, as he
offered, and Cheney accepted, the role of vice presidential
candidate. The choice, heralded as a sound and sensible one by many
Republicans and derided by Democrats as a throw-back to the
administration of former President Bush, marked the first major
decision that Bush has made since emerging as the likely Republican
contender earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had long said his choice would be the first by which the
public could measure his judgment. He also long ago laid out three
qualifications for his vice president: A shared political
philosophy, personal compatibility and the unquestioned ability to
serve president should the need arise.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing concerns about Cheney's heart problems and rejecting
the temptation to pick a runningmate from a politically significant
state, Bush telephoned Cheney at home at 6:22 a.m. to invite him
onto the Republican ticket. Hours later, the two men, flanked by
their wives, shared the stage in a University of Texas conference
room to make their triumphant announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed by the thoughtful and thorough way he
approached his mission, and gradually I realized that the person
who was best qualified to be my vice presidential nominee was
working by my side,'' Bush told the crowd of 200 or so campaign
workers and supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly did not expect that I would be standing here
today,'' Cheney said in response. ``But I had an experience that
changed my mind this spring.''
</P>
<P>
   That experience, as recounted by several Bush aides, involved
weeks of persuasion by the Texas governor and even input from his
father, former president George Bush, who placed a key telephone
call last week to settle questions about Cheney's health.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, who served as Pentagon chief in the Bush
administration after spending 11 years representing Wyoming in the
US House, rose to the top of the Texas governor's short-list almost
as quickly as the Republican primaries came to an end, aides said.
During a meeting in the governor's mansion in Austin in March, Bush
asked Cheney, a close advisor on foreign policy matters and
longtime friend, to think about joining the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney, the chief executive officer of Halliburton, a
Dallas-based energy and construction services business, declined.
He instead agreed to run the vice presidential selection process,
and began, on April 25, to solicit voting and other public records
from willing candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney vetted numerous contenders, including governors Frank
Keating of Oklahoma and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania. (Bush aides said
that Ridge had privately withdrawn himself from the running three
weeks ago, citing personal reasons). Cheney spoke with Bush on an
almost-daily basis. As the weeks passed, the two men ``developed a
great friendship,'' communications director Karen Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as he surveyed his possibile running mates _ which at times
included as many as 20 or 30 Republicans _ Bush returned repeatedly
to his original preference, aides said. Over the July 4th weekend,
he again broached the topic with Cheney, taking him out on a back
porch to ask him to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Cheney said he would.
</P>
<P>
   Having suffered three mild heart attacks more than a dozen years
ago, Cheney flew to Washington on July 11 to undergo a physical
exam. The following day, his doctors ``gave him a clean bill of
health,'' Hughes said. Bush, seeking an independent evaluation,
called his father to request that he put Cheney's doctors in touch
with Dr. Denton Cooley, a cardiac surgeon and Bush family friend.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, on July 15, Bush brought Cheney to Austin
to meet his top ring of advisors. Even then, however, he continued
to evaluate other contenders, meeting with John Danforth, the
former senator from Missouri, in Chicago on July 18.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was persistent. The following day, on July 19, he
placed an early morning phone call to Cheney telling him he wanted
to ``seriously consider'' him. At Bush's request, Cheney met with
members of his company's board and raised the possibility that he
might leave.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Cheney said, Bush was ``always firm and always fair.
And in the end, I learned how persuasive he can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the phone calls former President Bush made during the
discussions about Cheney's health, the Bush campaign downplayed the
idea that the governor relied on his father's counsel to reach a
decision. His role was primarily ``that of a loving father,''
Hughes said. And over this past weekend, while visiting a retreat
in California, the former president gave no indication, in
conversations with friends, that he had tried to influence his son.
Former Wyoming senator Alan Simpson, who saw the elder Bush on
Friday, said the former president simply described the choice as
``interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say it shows his dependence on his dad's thinking;
I think it shows his independence,'' said Republican strategist
Kellyanne Fitzpatrick. ``I didn't know he would have the ability to
resist the calls to choose from among the cast of governors and the
calls of opinion leaders to go with someone that is bold and
titillating.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisors also insisted that Cheney had been fully vetted
himself, despite his role as an independent selection committee
chair. Senior Adviser Joseph Allbaugh oversaw the analysis of his
public records; when it came to more personal matters, such as
financial records and personal history, the Texas governor handled
the vetting himself, aides said. ``Cheney discussed with him his
own finances the way other candidates discussed theirs with
Cheney,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, after a weekend of rumors and numerous leaks to media
outlets that Bush had settled on Cheney, the governor placed the
decisive phone call. As Cheney got off the phone, according to
Hughes, he told his wife: ``Honey, let's sell the house. I quit my
job. We're going back into politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Early polls suggested that the public viewed the Cheney pick as
solid, but perhaps uninspiring. According to a Gallup poll of 644
registered voters, 55 percent of respondents said the selection was
``excellent'' or ``pretty good'' _ 11 points higher than when
President Bush selected Dan Quayle as a running mate in 1988. But
only 14 percent of Republicans said it would make them more likely
to vote for the GOP ticket. In 1996, 26 percent said they would be
more likely to vote Republican because Senator Bob Dole chose Jack
Kemp.

 &HT;    EDITORIAL: Married couples entitled to relief
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now here's a doozy of a justification, even for the
president of the United States, who's had plenty of practice of
late.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has vowed to veto legislation that would do away
with the ``marriage penalty'' tax. It would immediately raise the
standard deduction for married couples to to that of two single
people, and gradually expand the 15 percent tax bracket.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton considers the legislation too costly. He described
it as ``one part of a fiscally irresponsible, poorly targeted and
regressive tax plan.'' (Another part, apparently, is the phaseout
of estate taxes, which Clinton has also promised to veto.)
</P>
<P>
   ``By itself, I will veto the plan,'' Clinton said. Unless, of
course, the GOP ``compromises'' by agreeing to Clinton's latest
Medicare entitlement. If Republican lawmakers let Clinton have his
own fiscally irresponsible $250 billion Medicare prescription
benefit plan, so appealing to the powerful senior voting bloc,
well, Clinton just could find this $90 billion marriage penalty
relief thing a whole lot more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight percent of married couples pay the marriage penalty,
according to the Treasury Department. The average annual tax
``penalty'' for not being single is $1,400, Republicans say. The
measure that lawmakers approved last week would reduce taxes for
married couples by $90 billion over the next five years. And the
evidence shows there's nothing irresponsible about ending the
marriage penalty but a whole lot that's questionable about
Clinton's Medicare prescription coverage plan.
</P>
<P>
   Fact No. 1: Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office
projected a massive $2.17 trillion in federal surpluses over the
next decade. Last month, the White House had projected a $1.87
trillion surplus, more than double its January forecast of $887
billion. Any customer overcharged in a store would return, receipt
in hand, and demand the difference. The customer would get it, and
an apology, too. Why is it so difficult for the government to
refund the money it's overcharged taxpayers?
</P>
<P>
   Fact No. 2: Democrats complain that the GOP's plans to eliminate
the marriage penalty, along with estate taxes, would result in 43
percent of the cuts benefiting the wealthiest 1 percent of
Americans. They call it a giveaway to the rich.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Foundation reports that the wealthiest 1 percent paid
one-third of the federal individual income tax in 1997, the most
recent data available. The top 5 percent of income earners made
31.8 percent of all income, but paid 51.9 percent of federal
individual income taxes. The top 10 percent made 42.8 percent of
all income and paid 63.2 percent of the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the bottom 50 percent of the nation's taxpayers
earned 13.8 percent of all income in 1997, and paid 4.3 percent of
taxes. That those who pay most of the taxes receive most of the tax
cuts is neither unfair nor a giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   Fact No. 3: Only 2 percent of Americans are currently affected
by the estate tax that allows the federal government to tax up to
55 percent of estates worth more than $675,000. But this punitive
``death tax'' forces one in three families affected to sell all or
part of their business to pay the estate tax, according to the
Small Business Administration. Similar to the recently repealed
federal phone tax, it used to be a tax on the rich. But in these
economic good times, the homeowner with a 401(k) plan and some life
insurance that would place his estate in the death tax bracket
isn't rich, just a careful planner.
</P>
<P>
   Fact No. 4: The Medicare plan Clinton is touting would offer
prescription drug coverage for all Medicare beneficiaries. The GOP
has offered its own version. But, according to the Heritage
Foundation, although nine out of 10 Medicare beneficiaries use
prescription drugs, only one in 10 has annual out-of-pocket
expenditures for prescription drugs of $1,000 to $2,000, and only 4
percent report spending more than $2,000. And according to the
Kaiser Foundation's latest data, nearly 70 percent of Medicare
recipients have some form of prescription drug coverage _ through
employer-sponsored health plans, Medigap, Medicare HMOs or
Medicaid.

   Government is obliged, of course, to provide for the truly needy
among Medicare recipients. It is not fiscally responsible to
provide another, costly government-run entitlement to all 40
million recipients when, clearly, only a few need it. It is,
however, politically expedient in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Taking all this into account, Clinton should be hard pressed to
come up with an explanation as to why relieving the tax burden on
families in a booming economy is anathema, but why Americans should
consider it noble that the government is taking their money to
spend on an unnecessary entitlement. We urge the president to sign
the estate tax and marriage penalty legislation and allow families
to keep more of their hard-earned money.

`THE HUNTRESS': SINGLE MOM, DESPERATELY SEEKING BAIL JUMPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for

<P>
   Look, it's another vulnerable single woman with a heart of gold,
just trying to find her way along life's rocky road, which is
strewn with all the wrong men. But Dottie Thorson stands out from
the pack. She drinks, smokes, cusses and uses her 19-year-old
daughter and large firearms as accessories in her work. Dottie is a
bounty hunter, making ends meet by hauling in miscreants who have
jumped bail.
</P>
<P>
   That's the premise of ``The Huntress,'' a series USA is
unveiling Wednesday night. Played straight, it would surely be
tiresome. But presented as an off-kilter spoof, and draped around a
winningly drawn central character, the premise has promise.
</P>
<P>
   As portrayed with slightly nutsy, dewy-eyed enthusiasm by
Annette O'Toole, Dottie is someone you know you'll never meet. But
that doesn't stop you from wishing that you could.
</P>
<P>
   Just to make things complicated, there really is a bounty hunter
named Dottie Thorson, who was the inspiration for a television
movie, shown on USA in March, that also starred O'Toole. Thorson,
you're told, took up bounty hunting, the occupation of her husband,
Ralph, after he was killed by a car bomb. And despite such
occupational hazards, she brought her daughter, Brandi, into the
family business. Thus the voice-over line that opens the series:
``Only the unbelievable parts are true.'' True? Well, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   When first glimpsed, Brandi (Jordana Spiro) is standing on a
street corner in the flimsiest of tiny frocks, winking at passing
cars. An S.U.V. stops, she climbs in and throws a pair of handcuffs
on the driver, announcing that she knows he's a fugitive. Mom shows
up in an instant, holding a rifle to the guy's head, and Brandi
socks him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get blood on that dress, I'm gonna kill you,'' wails
Dottie. Brandi whines back, ``Chill out, Mom, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Antonio Ramos plays Ricky Guzman, the bail bondsman who
reluctantly hires the Thorsons. Ricky's business is a mess. His
office is overflowing with the appliances and other large objects
his long-gone clients left as collateral. ``I make half my money
these days on eBay,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Tiny Bellows (James Remar). Dottie brought him in,
but he captured her heart. When her daughter describes Tiny as
``the baddest killer psycho biker in the state,'' Dottie coos:
``He's not a psycho, Brandi. Yes, he's made some bad lifestyle
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Dottie, Tiny's in prison, where she visits him
for heart-to-heart chats. When he assures her that she is a natural
bounty hunter, she's so thrilled she giggles. ``It's like finding
out you're naturally talented in karaoke or something,'' she says,
beaming.
</P>
<P>
   On another visit she confesses her lack of confidence about
finding her prey. ``I feel like I'm chasing a ghost,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   He replies dreamily, ``You are.''
</P>
<P>
   That ghost is Ralph, whose wife and daughter are still pretty
angry over his neglect. As they try to deal with their feelings,
the show threatens to turn maudlin. Big mistake. Even a little more
of that would turn this loopy soap bubble into mere soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately &UR; , &LR;  there's little time for feelings in Wednesday
night's episode, written by the series' executive producer, Pamela
Norris, and directed by Jeffrey Reiner. Mother and daughter race
another bounty hunter to capture yet another bounty hunter who has
gotten himself into more than the usual trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Dottie and Brandi catch up with their quarry (Gary Busey, who
fits right into the antic spirit of the enterprise) at a car wash,
where Brandi chases him through suds and spray.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that smell?'' asks Dottie, once they get back in the
car.
</P>
<P>
   Brandi replies: ``That would be me. Got the optional air
freshener applied.''
</P>
<P>
   That kid's smart mouth does get annoying after a while. Good
thing her mom is such a charmer.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Just before ``The Huntress,'' on Wednesdays at 9 p.m., USA is
offering new episodes of another familial adventure, ``Cover Me.''
This is the story of Danny Arno (Peter Dobson), an undercover FBI
agent who shares his work and peril with his wife and three
teen-age children. Despite that obvious similarity, these two shows
are far apart in approach. ``Cover Me'' is far more slick, for good
and ill. Its production has the sheen of the best television
productions, but you may feel that you've been down this road a few
times too many.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's episode puts the family in danger as a onetime
pornographer gets out of prison vowing vengeance upon Danny and the
mysterious femme fatale who helped Danny get the goods on the guy
years before. There is a nifty plot twist, but you may well guess
the secret long before the bad guy does.
</P>
<P>
   Melora Hardin, as Danny's wife, Barbara, and Cameron Richardson,
Antoinette Picatto and Michael Angarano, as the children, make a
sensitive, picture-perfect family. The suspense is supposed to come
from your fears that at least two family members may be killed by
that bad guy. On the first night of a new season? You think so?

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the end of two weeks of marathon negotiations
with the leaders of Israel and the Palestinians, a visibly fatigued
President Clinton announced on Tuesday that ``they will not be able
to reach an agreement at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and other American mediators made clear that it
was Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who balked in the end,
and by all accounts the issue was Jerusalem, the holy city both
Israelis and Palestinians claim as their sacred capital.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the White House, Clinton singled out the Israeli
prime minister, Ehud Barak, for his readiness to make hard
compromises. The president also declared that the discussions at
Camp David had been ``really unprecedented'' in raising issues
``that had long been considered off limits.'' The issue of
Jerusalem in particular had long been regarded as virtually
intractable.
</P>
<P>
   None of the parties announced any immediate plans to resume
talks, and Arafat's declared intention to unilaterally proclaim a
Palestinian state on Sept. 13 set a serious deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In his parting statement, Barak said, ``The vision of peace
suffered a major blow, but I believe that with good faith, good
will on all sides it can recuperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat made no comment before departing. But his chief
negotiators, Saeb Erekat and Mahmoud Abbas _ more commonly known as
Abu Mazen _ said the negotiations had laid groundwork for an
agreement by Sept. 13. ``What happened at Camp David are seeds that
will grow very fast,'' said Abu Mazen.
</P>
<P>
   The two-week exercise at Camp David, which included day and
night negotiations, threatened walkouts and at least one narrowly
averted breakdown, marked one of the most intensive mediating
efforts by an American president in the Middle East since Jimmy
Carter brokered a peace between Israel and Egypt in 1979.

SATIRE CREATOR BACKS OFF WHEN IT COMES TO THE SPELLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Never underestimate the power of a mogul
peeved. Aaron Spelling, father of Tori and countless prime-time
soaps, didn't appreciate some passages in The WB's new soap spoof,
``Grosse Pointe,'' and changes are being made in the pilot, which
critics haven't seen yet.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Star, creator and producer of the half-hour comedy about
behind-the-scenes antics on a fictional show that's eerily similar
to ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' says his relationship with the
Spellings is too important to ruin for a Hollywood satire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my intention to go out and hurt anybody's feelings,''
Star said Monday. ``Aaron Spelling and Tori Spelling were upset and
they are people who I have really great relationships with.''
</P>
<P>
   Star, currently the golden-boy producer of HBO's ``Sex and the
City,'' created and produced ``90210'' and ``Melrose Place,''
making lots of money for Spelling's production company over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that ``Grosse Pointe'' remains satirical, but
that a character whose appearance and mannerisms are much like Tori
Spelling's will be modified. Star said the Tori-like actress
(Lindsay Sloane) will have brown hair instead of red, references to
her career emerging out of nepotism will be eliminated, and a scene
in which an actress purges herself in the back of a limousine will
be cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not easily letting it go,'' Star admitted, ``but the
important thing to me is that it wasn't really worth fighting to
the point of perhaps not seeing it on the air. ... I agree if
you're doing a satire, you sometimes have to be merciless and
that's where the humor comes from, but I feel confident that we'll
be able to sort of dance around this without hurting the show.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I've always had a nice relationship with Aaron.
That's why I'm taking a lot of his concerns to heart. If I didn't
have a good relationship with him, this would not be my response.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Saturday has been the graveyard shift of prime time.
Often, producers who were told their new series had been picked up
didn't know whether to celebrate or toss in the towel when they
learned their show would be airing on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   This season, after struggling gamely for several years with
``Profiler,'' ``The Pretender'' and a variety of other dramas, NBC
is surrendering and going with theatrical movies on Saturday. ABC
chose that route last season. With Fox continuing its reality
package of ``Cops'' and ``America's Most Wanted'' on Saturdays,
only CBS will be presenting original, scripted material on Saturday
nights this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Even the energetic WB network, which had always planned to be a
seven-night-a-week operation, has changed its mind for now. Jamie
Kellner, the network's CEO, said: ``I think Saturday night is the
least exciting place to try to invest money in programming. And
since a number of our stations continue to have sports commitments
(on Saturday nights), I think it may be a place that we stay away
from for quite a while.''
</P>
<P>
   James Cameron sank the ``Titanic.'' Now it's Seattle's turn.
</P>
<P>
   The mega-producer of blockbuster films tries his hand at
television this fall with Fox's ``Dark Angel,'' a sci-fi drama
about a genetically altered superwoman (Jessica Alba) who
reluctantly fights for truth, justice and a place to park her
motorcycle while eluding the bad people who did experiments on her
when she was a child.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 2020. The scene is Seattle, shortly after terrorists
have set off an electromagnetic pulse in the atmosphere that knocks
out all satellites, toppling the economy and plunging the world
into a 1930s-style depression in which politicians are for hire,
cops are crooked and the future looks drearier than Seattle in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Why Seattle?
</P>
<P>
   Cameron's co-producer, Charles Eglee (``Murder One''), said:
``What we really wanted to get a sense of was an urban landscape
kind of pressing in around people, to see it teeming and
overflowing, and Seattle has that sort of downtown. You've got that
sense of enclosure. And all of it is happening against this
beautiful backdrop with mountains and water and everything. The
visual tension between this distressed world and this natural
beauty was kind of interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the series is being shot in Vancouver, B.C., where
natural beauty costs 30 percent less. But there will be shots of a
charred Space Needle in ``Dark Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just this symbol of 1960s buoyant American optimism about
the future and technology,'' Eglee said. ``We thought it would be
interesting to take that location in a post-dot-com world, where
the old money is the faded dot-com fortunes, where people are
trying to keep up appearances and keep things together because the
world is broken. It just seemed like a logical setting for this
piece.''

 MARKET PLACE: SEC PROPOSES DISCLOSURE of DATA ON STOCK TRADES  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many investors know to the penny how much they pay
in commissions when they trade a stock, but have no idea how good
an execution they get for their money.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday proposed a rule
that will force the people who actually execute the trades, ranging
from Nasdaq market makers to specialists on the New York Stock
Exchange floor, to compile and disclose statistics on how they
trade each stock in which they make a market. The SEC is asking for
comment for 45 days, after which it will decide whether to act on
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   If the rule is adopted and works as is hoped, it will provide
answers to many questions that have bedeviled the market as
competition has grown. For the first time, investors will be able
to see what they are getting for their commissions in terms of
quality of execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can it be that most investors today simply do not know
what happens to their orders after they click `submit'?'' asked
Arthur Levitt, the SEC chairman. ``It doesn't make sense when you
recognize that missing the best price by the minimum increment
available _ 1/16 _ on a 1,000-share order is worth $62.50, an
amount that dwarfs the commission of most online firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those online firms, as well as others that take orders
by phone, have been able to offer low commission rates because they
effectively get a portion of the profit generated from trading
orders. Some do that by sending orders to markets or market makers
that pay for order flow _ or giving a penny or two a share to the
firms. Some others send their orders to sister companies, a
practice known as internalization.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics the SEC is requesting will make it possible to
assess the quality of execution offered by each market maker in
each stock, and to measure its performance on different kinds of
orders. The figures are likely to provide information on whether
market makers who pay for order flow are able to do so because they
often force investors to pay higher prices than their competitors
would have done.
</P>
<P>
   They will show how often market makers were able to improve
prices _ that is, to allow the investor to buy or sell a stock at a
price better than the posted bid or asked price for a stock _ and
how often investors ended up doing worse than that price. The
figures will also show how fast orders were executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will provide information on the cost of trading, which I
don't think most investors understand,'' said Laura Unger, a member
of the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Colby, deputy director of the SEC's division of market
regulation, said he hoped the disclosures would force some market
makers to improve the quality of their markets or risk losing
business.
</P>
<P>
   Some market makers voiced support of the SEC while noting that
they had not yet seen details. ``This will hold everyone's feet to
the fire,'' said Bernard L. Madoff, the chairman of Bernard L.
Madoff Investment Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Michael T. Dorsey, general counsel of Knight Trading, said that
``disclosure is the right way to go'' and that he was pleased that
the SEC had not moved to impose rules mandating market structure.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said it would study trading on Nasdaq and the New York
Stock Exchange to see if further steps were needed on
internalization and payment for orders.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, analyzing the numbers produced by the firms will
be a daunting task, but the SEC hopes that the financial press and
others will make sense of them. Each market maker will be releasing
about 300 numbers on each stock that it trades, and it will be
doing so on a monthly basis. The figures are to be posted on each
firm's web site.
</P>
<P>
   The volume is so large because there are many different kinds of
orders. It is clearly easier to execute small orders than large
ones, and market orders, to buy or sell a stock at the best price
available, differ from limit orders, which call for buying or
selling a stock only at a certain price. Moreover, limit orders
that are close to the current market price are different from
orders that are farther away. So numbers are needed for many
different permutations.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage firms will have to tell their customers once a quarter
how they decide where to send orders, and what relationships the
firms have with those places. They will also have to state the
rationale for choosing that market maker. The statistics would then
make it possible to ascertain whether that market maker really was
making a good market.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are one way the SEC is trying to deal with issues
raised by the recent proliferation of competitors, who have
fragmented the markets. Such competition can bring efficiencies,
but it also risks stranding orders. One investor enters a limit
order to buy a stock at $20, and another may be trying to sell it
for the same amount. But if the orders are sent to different market
makers, neither could end up being executed.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious way to deal with fragmentation would be to create a
central limit-order book, or a ``clob,'' in Wall Street jargon. But
that would effectively make all markets into one, and the SEC has
backed away from that proposal under heavy pressure from both
markets and some members of congress.
</P>
<P>
   A similar restraint by the SEC was shown Tuesday when it dealt
with the options markets, where intermarket competition has grown
sharply since last fall. Those markets have no way to send orders
from one market to another that might have better prices, and the
SEC has been asking them to develop linkages.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC approved a proposal from three of the five options
exchanges _ the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the American Stock
Exchange and the International Securities Exchange _ for a linkage
that will allow unlimited transfer of customer orders but only
limited ability by a market maker at one exchange to trade on
another exchange. It stopped short of requiring other exchanges to
join that linkage or creating a central limit order book.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the other exchanges _ the Philadelphia Stock Exchange
and the Pacific Stock Exchange _ will be free to come up with their
own linkage plan if they want, or to join the other one. If they do
neither, however, they will have to disclose to customers when an
order was executed at a price that was not as good as was available
in another market. Fear of having to make such disclosures is
expected to propel all markets into some sort of linkage.

GREENSPAN SAYS UPCOMING ECONOMIC DATA TO INFLUENCE DECISION ON
RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said
Tuesday that the central bank's decision about whether to raise
interest rates again at its meeting in August would hinge in large
part on economic data released in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating a message he delivered to the Senate Banking Committee
last week, Greenspan told the House Banking Committee that higher
rates were starting to slow the economy and reduce the risk of
inflation, an analysis that has sparked hope in financial markets
that the Fed is finished or nearly finished raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed chairman said the extent of the slowdown remained
unclear, and he seemed to warn investors not to assume that the
central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee would
remain on hold when it meets on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in the next few weeks on the unemployment rate, job
creation, compensation costs, the growth rate and inflation ``will
have a significant effect upon what action the committee chooses to
take,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting in August, he said, ``we will make a judgment as
to whether or not further action or no action is the more
appropriate policy for the purpose of creating a more balanced
economy which has the capacity to continue this quite extraordinary
112-month expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised its benchmark short-term Federal funds rate
by 1.75 percentage points in six steps since June 1999, to 6.5
percent, in an effort to squelch inflation pressures before they
take root in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments came on a day in which two economic
indicators came in slightly stronger than analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Existing home sales increased by 2.8 percent in June, to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.23 million. And the consumer
confidence index published by the Conference Board, a business
research group, increased to 141.7 in July, up from 139.2 in June,
but still below the record level of 144.7 in January and May.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the consumer confidence numbers Tuesday, Greenspan
said it was ``clear that consumer confidence remains quite high in
this country, and that despite the evidence of some slowing down in
consumer buying, we're not confronted with a buyers' strike by any
remote sense of the meaning.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his appearance before the House committee, Greenspan repeated
the prepared testimony he had delivered to the Senate panel last
week, and answered questions for nearly three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about transcripts of Fed meetings in 1994 that portray him
as eager to bring stock prices down, Greenspan said he had
subsequently decided that monetary policy should not be used to
target Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   He said the rapidly increasing trade deficit was not an
immediate threat because foreigners were eager to get their hands
on dollars to invest in the United States, but he said that in the
long run the issue was ``probably the most difficult one'' facing
economic policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point something has to give,'' Greenspan said,
referring to the trade and current account deficits and the dollar,
which so far has remained quite strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know whether it will be protracted over a very long
period of time, in which case the adjustments will occur in the
normal manner without any significance, or whether they'll occur
more abruptly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also had a series of spirited exchanges with Democrats
on the committee about whether the economy and globalization are
leaving too many people behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman said that the booming economy had helped
reverse a decline in real incomes at the bottom of the economic
ladder, and that incomes had been growing since the mid-1990s. He
said it was important to recognize that globalization created
economic dislocation, and to help those who had lost jobs or
otherwise suffered economically because of the changes created by
global markets, but that its benefits far outweighed its drawbacks,
especially for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Challenged on whether the government should do more to help
people adapt to the rapid economic changes, Greenspan said job
training programs were often unsuccessful, and that the best
solution was to create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no substitute for getting people employed,'' he said.
``The most important thing that we as a government can do to
enhance the economic capabilities of the lesser-skilled people in
this country and the inner cities is to keep this economic growth
going.''
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan said there were always going to be some people out
of work by choice or as they change jobs. And he suggested that he
does not view the Federal Reserve or the government as capable of
eradicating all economic problems, even amid the nation's longest
business expansion ever.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Representative Barbara Lee, a Democrat from California,
what he would say to people who cannot afford to buy a home because
of the surge in real estate prices and mortgage rates, Greenspan
said the problem was not easily resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say to you I have a program which will either
knock $100,000 off every home or raise incomes by some specific
amount,'' Greenspan said. ``The world is not the way we'd always
like it to be.'' &QL;

`TEAM GUY' EVERETT WORKS OUT AS SUSPENSION CLOCK TICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Most of his Red Sox teammates had already dressed and
left the clubhouse to take batting practice Tuesday when Carl
Everett set about his pregame routine and began changing out of his
street clothes. On any other game day, Everett would have little
time to entertain questions from reporters, but this game day was
not like most others.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second of Everett's 10-game suspension. So he had
plenty of time.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who was replaced in center field by Darren Lewis
Tuesday night against the Minnesota Twins, began serving his
sentence Monday when he dropped his appeal of the suspension, which
was levied after his bumping incident with umpire Ron Kulpa in a
July 15 game against the New York Mets at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   After his vehement on-field protest, Everett seemed ready to
pursue an appeal off the field to any length. So why the sudden
change of heart?
</P>
<P>
   Everett wasn't offering much in the way of an explanation _
though he did offer an apology to fans, his teammates, and the
front office.
</P>
<P>
   Everett issued a statement that said, ``I apologize most
importantly for not being on the field during this 10-game period.
For playing late through October is the goal that each of us have
set our sights on, and for where I am, and in light of my daily
rule with attaining this goal, I apologize once more. I want to
thank the fans for all the support that they have given me,
especially here in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   But as for dropping the appeal, Everett said, ``There's not much
to say. Everybody's already been speculating, so there's no sense
in saying anything. I'll just let them continue to speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that Everett dropped the appeal
because his hand is injured _ he punched the bat rack during his
tirade _ and it would need time to heal anyway. Everett said his
hand was fine, even though it apparently kept him out of the lineup
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Everett also said he simply doesn't want to create a distraction
in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for the teammates,'' Everett said. ``Everybody wants to
go to them on how they feel about this and how they feel about
that. It's not fair to them and it's best to get it over with right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Everett will sit and wait, ineligible to play until Aug. 4,
when the Sox are scheduled to face the Kansas City Royals. He will
be allowed to travel and work out with the team, but he must leave
the premises once the game starts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was disappointed that he wasn't going to have a
chance to give his side of the story in an appeal hearing, Everett
said, ``No, because that's what I elected to do. It was ignorant on
everyone's part to say what is and what is not without (knowing).
Everybody wanted to expound on their own, so I shall let them
continue to expound and that's the choice that everyone made and
that's what you have to live with.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few good people get ruined by a bunch of bad apples.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Everett was taking the media to task; he has blamed
them for portraying him as ``a monster.'' Tuesday, though, he was
in a jocular mood in the clubhouse and even threw a playful bear
hug on Tomo Ohka, which caught the rookie pitcher by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But it stings to have to sit out 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to sit out, period,'' said Everett. ``But I'm a
team guy, and so I'm going to root for my team and try to stay in
shape.''

`MAGIC RAILROAD' IS CHARMING BUT STRANGE LITTLE TRIP

<P>
   ``Thomas, you're a really useful tank engine.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the highest compliment you can receive in this odd little
moppet adventure, based on the 1940s series of children's books by
the Rev. Wilber Awdry and the long-running TV series they inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be responsible, reliable and really useful'' is the mantra of
Mr. Conductor, played by a spirited Alec Baldwin. He's at once
playful, bemused and convincingly sincere as the diminutive
gatekeeper between the life-size real world of Shining Time, a
rather funky small-town station where new-age and old-world peoples
mix in accepting harmony, and the Island of Sobor, a toy-size world
of the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as a train hobbyist's version of Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Friendly steam engines bicker like
playground kids, and a mean diesel engine with a clawed shovel
attachment plays the bully.
</P>
<P>
   When the gold dust that allows the conductors to magically
travel through the lands runs out, Mr. Conductor embarks on a quest
to recover a legendary lost engine that holds the secret to the
magic railway, the tunnel between the two worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett Stone (Peter Fonda), a lonely old man haunted by a
failure in his past, holds the key in a hidden cave in Shining
Time. Fonda's performance is so low-key it's almost mummified: His
stone face never cracks a smile and his droning delivery is simply
flat.
</P>
<P>
   The movie preserves the cute low-tech effects of the TV show:
Toy trains chug along lovingly sculpted landscapes that would do a
hobbyist proud. A dash of digital gold dust and little flourishes
of fairy fireworks add a little modern sheen to the toy-box
make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   The lone 3-year-old at the screening I attended offered his
expert opinion: ``Good.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is inoffensive, and Baldwin is fun and engaging, but
the subplot about hard work and being ``useful'' just becomes more
insistent. Even when things are at their darkest, the engines keep
working because ``that's what Mr. Conductor would have wanted,''
and Mr. Conductor's happy-go-lucky nephew learns his lesson by
adventure's end: He's ready to stop playing and go to work.
</P>
<P>
   It's the strangest collision of lessons I've ever seen in a
kid's film: Believe in magic but respect the work ethic.

HEYNS SEEKING TO RECAPTURE THE RECORDS AND THE GLORY OF OLYMPICS
PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL ARKUSH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Day after day, for more than two months in early 1998, the South
African Olympic champion swimmer Penny Heyns arrived at the pool to
begin her training. Yet, day after day, the only thing that kept
rising to the surface was her discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no desire any more,'' recalled Heyns, 25, who trained at
the University of Nebraska, where she was pursuing undergraduate
studies. ``I was miserable. I had no peace. I would sit there and
just leave. Now and then, I'd get in the water, but it would be for
maybe 2,000 meters,'' only a third of her previous training
standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't lifting weights,'' she said. ``People were telling me
to quit, that I had already accomplished enough.''
</P>
<P>
   They had a strong case. During the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta,
Heyns had won the first two gold medals for South Africa, which had
been banned from Olympic competition from 1964 until 1992 because
of the country's racial policies of apartheid, since 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the last day of the 1996 Games, Josia Thugwane, a black
South African, won the men's marathon. Although Thugwane's triumph,
dedicated to ``my country and to President Mandela,'' put an
emotional exclamation point on South Africa's Olympics in Atlanta,
Heyns' two victories were more impressive. She established Olympic
records _ in the 100-meter (1:07:73) and 200-meter (2:25:41)
breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing left for Heyns to accomplish. Nonetheless, the
notion of retiring from the sport that she had long adored made her
feel as unsettled as the prospect of all-out preparation. So, she
left Nebraska in April 1998 and moved to Calgary, reuniting with
her longtime coach, Jan Bidrman, who had moved on to the University
of Calgary. In the process, Heyns somehow found a way to summon the
energy and motivation to take on the challenge one more time. She
has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to enjoy it again,'' said Heyns, who will compete in
the same two events in Sydney, as well as the 4 x 100 medley relay.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what inspires Heyns to try to duplicate what she
achieved in Atlanta is the belief that, if she is fortunate enough
to stand on the podium again, she will appreciate it more than she
did the last time. After her victory in the 100 in Atlanta, instead
of excitement, she felt empathy for her fellow competitor, Samantha
Riley of Australia, who took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had been a bit of a hero,'' Heyns said. ``I knew how
disappointed she must have been. The swim was way below her
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Heyns followed two days later with a triumph in the
200, becoming the first woman to capture both events in the same
Olympics, she was not able to fully absorb the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen people crying and waving and being overjoyed,''
said Heyns of some other athletes' response to winning medals,
``but I felt if I were to do that, it would be acting. I didn't
know what to do. Being South African, I didn't grow up with the
Olympic dream like most people. Only when I went back to South
Africa did I realize what a big deal it was.''
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly a bigger deal this time, especially since Heyns
gives every indication that her days of competition will likely end
in Australia. Spirited and spiritual _ she credits God frequently
for guiding her to make the proper decisions _ Heyns does not seem
to be an athlete who will linger on the stage too long, tarnishing
images of her past glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very grateful and humbled by my achievements,'' said
Heyns, who also competed in the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona, Spain.
``I think it's a gift. But, at the same time, there are more
important things in life. There are more than external things.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next two months, however, her focus will remain on
Sydney. Even so, it will not be easy to repeat. After a remarkable
1999 _ in a two-month stretch, she set 10 world records in the
breaststroke _ Heyns has staggered a bit this season. At last
week's Janet Evans Invitational in Los Angeles, a meet she
dominated in 1999, Heyns finished second in the 200-meter finals
with an unimpressive 2:29:89, more than six seconds slower than the
world mark she established last year. She and Bidrman chose to
emphasize the positive, that Heyns had actually improved a few
seconds from an even poorer performance a week earlier in
Vancouver. Nonetheless, still feeling the effects of some rigorous
training and a recent excursion to South Africa, Heyns is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any answers right now,'' said Heyns, who skipped
the 100-meter final in Los Angeles to do more training. ``I have
tired legs. It takes more out of me than it did in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The year held so much more promise in the winter when Heyns
posted her best training times. New world records in spring
competitions seemed attainable. That changed in March, however,
when a member of the University of Calgary's swim team was
seriously injured in a car accident. While the rest of the team was
at a meet, Heyns stayed behind to help comfort the swimmer's
family. She was at the hospital every day, and was in the room when
her friend died.
</P>
<P>
   Heyns refuses to use the tragedy as an excuse, and said, ``I had
never dealt with death before.'' Mike Blondal, the team's head
coach, added, ``It took a lot of emotional and physical energy for
her to be around the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it would be premature to dismiss Heyns' prospects in
Sydney. She still holds the world records in the 100 and 200, and
according to Bidrman ``always performs when it matters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know she'll swim fast,'' Bidrman said. ``Whether it will be
fast enough to win, I don't know. Maybe it is the best thing,'' he
said, referring to Heyns' current fatigue. ``Nobody will expect
anything from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Blondal: ``She has an incredible faith in herself. She'll
be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, except for a meet in Winnipeg, Manitoba, next month,
she will spend most of her time training. She will not have any
trouble finding the motivation to do laps and lift weights. Sydney,
after all, is less than two months away, and any signs of
discontent are long gone.

PRESIDENT OF AMAZON QUITS TO JOIN VERTICALNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Galli, it seems, isn't one to mull major career moves for
a long time. Just over a year ago, Galli a 19-year veteran of Black
&AMP; Decker, accepted the job as chief executive of Pepsico's
Frito-Lay division, then hours later changed his mind to become the
president and chief operating officer of Amazon.com instead.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Galli said he would quit Amazon to become president
and chief executive of VerticalNet, an Internet company that runs
56 Web sites devoted to specific industries, such as Pollution
Online. He took the job only a week after meeting Mark Walsh,
VerticalNet's current chief executive, over dinner at an industry
conference. Walsh will become chairman of VerticalNet, which is
based in Horsham, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Galli said he had been considering leaving Amazon, which is
based in Seattle, for some time because his children live with his
former wife in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back most weekends,'' Galli said, ``and I made a
decision this wasn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the decision of Galli was a gain for
VerticalNet and a loss for Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon handpicked Joe from a large pool and there has to be a
sting with him leaving,'' said Derek Brown, an analyst with WR
Hambrecht &AMP; Co. Amazon's shares fell $1.125, to $37.625 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, which lost $720 million last year, has been under a
great deal of scrutiny by investors in recent months as some
analysts questioned whether it could afford to pay for its rapid
expansion from simply selling books to offering everything from
paring knives to lawn chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Galli said his departure had nothing to do with any
disillusionment with Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Amazon.com, and I think that the company has enormous
potential,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bezos, the chairman and chief executive of Amazon, said
Galli's departure was amicable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was his reference yesterday with VerticalNet,'' Bezos said.
``I would have loved to keep Joe around, he has helped us
tremendously, but this is the right thing for him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At Amazon, his most visible accomplishment was spearheading the
company's entry into the tool and home improvement business, a
business line that has yet to prove successful. Bezos credited
Galli with recruiting talented mid-level managers.
</P>
<P>
   Internet executives who know both Bezos and Galli wondered,
however, how well the two driven and forceful men worked together.
Galli was hired to bring order to Amazon's sprawling operations,
yet Bezos himself has a history of being a hands-on manager.
</P>
<P>
   Galli said he worked well with Bezos.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon said that it was not looking for a replacement for Galli,
and that Bezos would assume the additional title of president, and
the eight executives who had reported to Galli would report to him.
</P>
<P>
   Galli may well find the job at VerticalNet to be more
financially rewarding, given the drop in Amazon.com's stock. When
he joined, Galli was granted options to purchase nearly four
million Amazon shares over 20 years, at a price of $57.95, some 80
percent above where the shares trade today.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Internet executives, Galli received substantial cash
compensation in addition to his stock options.
</P>
<P>
   He received an initial signing bonus of $100,000, a $200,000 a
year salary, and an additional bonus of $3 million for the first
year, $3 million for the second year, and $2 million the third
year, all payable at the beginning of the year. Galli just received
the second $3 million installment on June 24. According to Amazon
documents, Galli's contract says that if he leaves Amazon before
the end of the year, he must return the share of that year's bonus
that reflects the number of days he did not work.
</P>
<P>
   Galli and Walsh declined to specify Galli's compensation at
VerticalNet. Walsh did say, however, that it resembles most
Internet companies in that it is mainly composed of stock rather
than cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``If VerticalNet hits on all cylinders, then Joe Galli will be
one happy cat,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Galli was drawn to VerticalNet through a series of contacts.
Several months ago he met Kenneth Fox, the managing director of the
Internet Capital Group, one of VerticalNet's main backers, through
a dinner arranged by Fox's father, a construction executive who had
done business with Galli at Black &AMP; Decker.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was interested in recruiting Galli and arranged the dinner
with Walsh last week. There the two executives discovered that
Walsh's father was an advertising executive who worked on the Black
&AMP; Decker account.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh added that he and Galli hit it off right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a down to earth guy who wanted to come back to the East
Coast,'' Walsh said. ``We weren't looking for a CEO. But I said
let's make room on the bench.''

SWISS REVIVE INQUIRY INTO WHETHER RUSSIAN BANK LAUNDERED IMF MONEY
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Swiss officials are investigating whether $4.8 billion
paid to Russia by the International Monetary Fund in 1998 was
laundered through Swiss banks in transactions involving the Bank of
New York, according to investigative documents that revive
questions thought to have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Kaspar-Ansermet, a Geneva investigating magistrate,
asked banks in the southern canton of Ticino earlier this month for
help in locating accounts through which the money might have
passed.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-page letter to the banks, Kaspar-Ansermet wrote of
``certain elements of information'' indicating that the $4.8
billion was deposited in a Ticino bank account opened in the name
of the Ost-West Handelsbank AG, a German affiliate of the Russian
central bank, and an Austrian bank, Creditanstalt AG, before it was
funneled to banks in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is remarkable since the IMF commissioned an
audit by PriceWaterhouseCoopers last year that cleared the Russian
central bank of wrongdoing in handling the money.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Ost-West Handelsbank were not available for
comment. A Creditanstalt spokesman in Vienna, Peter Thier, denied
that the bank, now part of Bank Austria, had accounts in Ticino or
any contact with Ost-West Handelsbank.
</P>
<P>
   According to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New
York Times, Kaspar-Ansermet began an investigation last October of
money laundering charges against Peter Berlin and Lucy Edwards,
former employees of Bank of New York, who pleaded guilty to similar
offenses in a trial in New York earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kaspar-Ansermet said by phone that he was prevented by judicial
secrecy from commenting. But he indicated that the letter was only
one element in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the letter, the $4.8 billion of IMF money was
supposedly deposited in the Ticino account on Aug. 14, 1998. On
that day, or shortly thereafter, transfers totaling almost $7
billion were made from the account to banks in Britain, Australia,
Switzerland, and the United States, including a payment of $1.4
billion to the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Dawson, the IMF's director of external relations, said the
IMF was aware of the Swiss inquiry but that ``we have received no
information that contradicts what is in the PriceWaterhouseCoopers
report.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF ordered the Russian Central Bank's handling of the $4.8
billion examined last year after allegations arose that it was
improperly funneled into private bank accounts outside Russia. But
auditors found the money was distributed to roughly 18 Russian
commercial banks in order to support the value of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   The report strongly criticized the central bank's use of a
finance company on the British Channel Islands, Fimaco, in the
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the transactions outlined in Kaspar-Ansermet's
letter appear to be virtually identical to those provided last year
in Moscow by Viktor Ilyukhin, a communist member of the Russian
parliament, that were examined by IMF auditors and found to be
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, for instance, Kaspar-Ansermet says the $4.8
billion was transferred from the New York Federal Reserve in one
sum on Aug. 14, 1998, when in fact it was doled out piecemeal over
several days. Moreover, he cites a transfer of $2.35 billion from
the Ticino account to the Bank of Sydney, Australia, though the IMF
found no such bank exists.

SEEKING LAWS FOR DISABILITIES OF THE ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
  By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years ago Wednesday, when the Americans With Disabilities
Act became law, the unemployment rate among disabled people was 70
percent. It still is, almost everyone agrees. And the stories of
Sarah Triano and Richard Clark help explain why.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 36, was a five-year veteran of the Chicago police force
when a car crash left him almost completely paralyzed. The police
department put him on leave, and he has lived on Social Security
since. Clark, who uses a wheelchair and can walk with a cane,
argued, however, that he could do desk work, and he sought help
from Equip for Equality, an advocacy group in Chicago, which sued
for Clark's reinstatement in 1997. The United States District Court
dismissed his claim once, but it is now scheduled for trial in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many throughout the department,'' Clark said of the
number of desk jobs. ``I've done a few of them before when I was in
uniform, administrative stuff, like keeping logs and records.
There's no question in my mind that there is a place for me where I
can continue to make a valuable contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Chicago police force said Clark was
offered a desk job but ``he wanted to remain a sworn police
officer,'' a title reserved to people who can respond to
emergencies and fire their guns from a standing position. ``This is
mostly where the dispute comes from,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Triano, she says she always wanted to be a lawyer, and
after graduating Phi Beta Kappa from the University of California
at Santa Barbara in 1996, she set out to take the law school
admittance exam. But a hereditary immune-system disorder makes her
highly susceptible to colds and infections and prone to diarrhea
and vomiting when under stress. Because of that, she had always
been given access to a bathroom while taking tests in high school
and college.
</P>
<P>
   The Law School Admission Council, which administers the Law
School Admission Test, refused to grant her special privileges, she
says, even after she submitted medical records from her
immunologists and letters from Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   In frustration, Triano, 25, started an Internet support group
for people who had had similar problems in taking the law exams,
and 50 people joined, she says. She also complained to the Justice
Department, saying that her rights for reasonable accommodation of
her condition had been violated. As a result of similar complaints,
she says, the department sued the Law School Admission Council last
year in the Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
to try to force it to change its policy on accommodating students
with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the council is ``in extreme disagreement on
whether or not we've violated'' the disabilities act, said Joan E.
Van Tol, its corporate counsel. ``We've complied with all the
requirements'' in accommodating the complainants and ``in
responding to the thousands of other test takers who have requested
accommodations.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, though, the experience so upset Triano that she
abandoned law and enrolled in the Ph.D. program in disability
studies at the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people with disabilities try and get into traditional
employment fields like law and are getting turned down,'' Triano
said. ``So they're going into a field where they can get the
accommodation they need, which is in the disabled community. I've
seen this happen time and again.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustrations that Clark and Triano have encountered mirror a
larger and troubling reality: despite federal law to protect them
against discrimination in hiring and promotion, and despite efforts
by companies to recruit and train them and make job sites more
accessible to them, the disabled continue to face a huge struggle
for full workplace equality.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason seems to be that although the law has changed,
attitudes have not. ``Clearly, many employers don't know how to
level the playing field and engage people with disabilities in
jobs,'' said Dr. Susanne Bruyere, director of the program on
employment and disability at Cornell. ``We need to infuse all
participants _ from upper management to supervisors to workers _
with new attitudes toward the one in six Americans with
disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   William G. Stothers, deputy director of the Center for an
Accessible Society, a resource group in San Diego, says many
employers are simply nervous about hiring disabled people. They
wonder, he says, how much training and special attention such
workers will need, whether they will be productive and how their
presence will affect their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a stretch for some employers to expect a person with
disability to be a valuable employee,'' Stothers said. ``That's the
risk that needs taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Odzer, the chief executive of Global Supply Net, a
company in New York for the janitorial industry, says his managers
sometimes question him for hiring so many mentally disabled
workers. They say, ``Let's get a regular person,'' he said. ``I
say, `That is a regular person, it's just a person with a
disability.' People are people, but not everyone sees that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the difficulty in enforcing the disabilities
act. Indeed, just determining what constitutes a disability can be
a problem. Obviously, paralysis and blindness qualify, but other
conditions, like attention deficit disorders and alcoholism, are
debated. As a result, the figures for the number of disabled
Americans vary widely, though a generally accepted estimate is 54
million.
</P>
<P>
   Activists say adverse rulings and contradictory federal policies
add to the confusion. Almost 90 percent of complaints to the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission are rejected, and 98 percent of
disability discrimination lawsuits are decided for the defendants,
which are usually businesses, the American Bar Association says.
</P>
<P>
   For all the obstacles they see, though, activists mostly hail
the act as a landmark in the struggle for full acceptance. Marca
Bristo, 46, chairwoman of the National Council on Disability, is
paralyzed from the neck down as a result of a diving accident but
can use her hands. She says that discrimination against the
disabled is rampant in the workplace and that she experiences it
daily. Yet, she says, the disabilities act has had a transforming
effect on her and millions of others because it gives them hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived in three Americas,'' Bristo said. ``The first was
as a nondisabled person in a world where I didn't know there was
discrimination against disabled people. The second was for the 13
years after I broke my neck but before there was an A.D.A. The
third has been the America I've lived in since the A.D.A. The
experiences have been like three different countries.''

 &HT;    Federal judge had warned University of Georgia about race policy
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    and Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - U.S. District Judge B. Avant Edenfield had warned the
University of Georgia about ``the road ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   In prior rulings, the Savannah jurist told UGA that if it
continued using racial preferences to ensure a diverse student
body, the policy would not withstand scrutiny. On Monday, Edenfield
followed through on that admonition and said UGA's use of race
violates the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield, who was appointed by President Carter, minced few
words on how he felt about the policy. And his ruling becomes the
second in the nation to question the significance of a landmark
1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision on the use of racial preferences
in university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield's ruling resolved only one of several lawsuits pending
before him attacking UGA's admissions program. Plaintiffs' lawyers
predict they will prevail in the other cases as well, while
advocates of the progam say they hope Edenfield's ruling will be
overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem, of course, is that in UGA's world some are `more
equal' than others,'' Edenfield wrote. ``UGA's claim that it can
simultaneously ensure equality of both opportunity and result,
particularly by means of an admissions process that awards bonus
points to some races but not others, simply defies logic.''
</P>
<P>
   UGA officials say they are not sure how the ruling will
influence the admissions criteria for those students applying for
slots in the class of 2001. So far, race remains part of the Total
Student Index, a set of factors used in evaluating about 1,200
applicants each year.
</P>
<P>
   Gender was removed from the index last year. Remaining criteria
include economic and academic disadvantage, Georgia residency,
academic factors, leadership and whether parents attended college.
The UGA admissions policy, and its inclusion of race as one of many
factors, was devised after the 1978 Supreme Court ruling in Regents
of the University of California vs. Bakke.
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield ruled in favor of three white women _ Jennifer
Johnson, Aimee Bogrow and Molly Ann Beckenhauer _ who filed suit
after being denied admission to UGA in 1999. Edenfield ordered UGA
to pay damages to the women and offer them admission. Fall semester
begins Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson filed suit, UGA granted her admission. But the
Jonesboro High School graduate had already committed to attend
Mercer University. Saying Johnson is entitled to recover expenses
she paid Mercer in excess of what she would have paid UGA for the
1999 Fall semester, Edenfield ordered UGA to pay her $2,060.
</P>
<P>
   Beckenhauer, who graduated from Lakeside High School in Martinez
and attends Clemson University, is entitled to $7,184 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Bogrow, who graduated from North Springs High School in North
Fulton, attends the less-costly Georgia Perimeter College.
Edenfield awarded her a nominal amount of $1.
</P>
<P>
   Bogrow's father, Bernie, said Tuesday that his daughter was on
vacation and unavailable for comment. As to whether she will now
attend UGA, he said, ``I am not sure. That's her call, her
decision. I do know this is a late date ... If (the ruling) came a
month ago, it would be a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials say they are considering whether to appeal
Edenfield's decision to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case that Judge Edenfield was ruling on didn't exclusively
focus on gender, it focused on race and gender, but we'd already
dropped gender as a consideration for the class of 2000,'' UGA
spokesman Tom Jackson said. ``The law has been very murky in this,
and an appeal might move us closer to the definitive ruling we all
seek. An appeal is being considered as a way of trying to get
clarity on this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kronley, senior consultant to the Atlanta-based Southern
Education Foundation, urged UGA to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   He also gave Edenfield credit for addressing the issue head-on.
``It's what a conscientious federal judge does,'' Kronley said.
``He ruled with the understanding that the issues raised here are
of profound importance and that higher courts ought to review it
carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the federal appeals court in New Orleans ordered the
University of Texas Law School to stop discriminating against white
applicants, saying the factor of race may no longer be used to
achieve a diverse student body. The court also said the Bakke
ruling was no longer good law.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bakke case, the high court invalidated the University of
California at Davis's medical school admissions policy, which
included racial quotas. But the late Justice Lewis Powell also
wrote that diversity in higher education was a compelling state
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield acknowledged that lower courts have since issued
rulings assuming that Powell's writing on diversity was the law of
the land. But Edenfield said he would not engage in that type of
```assumption` dodge'' because he does not believe Powell was
writing for the court's majority.
</P>
<P>
   The high court handed down six separate opinions in its Bakke
decision and, Edenfield noted, Powell's opinion was not joined by
any other justice.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Shaw of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund said
Edenfield's reasoning ``is flat-out different to our interpretation
of Bakke. ... Bakke is still the law of the land, despite what this
federal judge says.''
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield also disparaged pre-trial testimony given by former
UGA President Charles Knapp, who said that diverse student bodies
help students learn how to work cooperatively inside and outside
the classroom. ``This sort of circular, `It is so because I say so'
logic is precisely what the Supreme Court resoundingly rejected''
in other affirmative actions cases, Edenfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Lee Parks, who represents the three women
plaintiffs, has filed other lawsuits against UGA; one attacks the
2000 admissions program and another attacks UGA's School of Law
admissions program.
</P>
<P>
   UGA will not prevail on these lawsuits either, Harlan Miller, a
partner of Parks', said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the people at the University of Georgia are
well-intentioned in what they are trying to do, but it's not
consistent with the Constitution,'' Miller said. ``That's just the
way it is.''

AIRBUS GETS MORE ORDERS AT AIR SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Airbus Industrie won more than $7 billion in new
airplane orders Tuesday at the Farnborough air show and picked up a
key endorsement for its A3XX super jumbo from the world's second
largest leasing company.
</P>
<P>
   International Lease Finance Corp. said it will buy five of the
555-passenger A3XX jets as part of an order for 87 Airbus planes.
The announcement nudged Airbus ahead of Boeing in the race for
orders at this year's show. But Boeing is expected to fatten its
totals Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest orders for the A3XX also put Airbus nearly halfway to
having the 50 or so it needs to formally launch the program by
year's end.
</P>
<P>
   With so much debate surrounding the A3XX and the size of the
market for such a huge plane, Airbus executives were all smiles as
they listened to an assessment of the market from Steve Hazy, chief
executive of International Lease.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters at a packed news conference that that his
leasing company had studied high density markets served today by
Boeing's 747-400 and concluded that a bigger plane is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have carefully analyzed the markets served currently by the
Boeing 747 and we believe that by 2005 between 30 and 40 city pairs
will reach a saturation point,'' Hazy said. ``The only way to
progress will be through larger aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the Airbus news conference, Hazy had been with
Boeing executives as they toasted the five major launch customers
for the new long-range 777X jets.
</P>
<P>
   Those customers _ EVA Airways, All Nippon Airways, Japan
Airlines, International Lease and GE Capital Aviation Services _
have ordered 39 of the new planes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those planes were part of $12 billion in orders
announced Monday by Boeing on the opening day of show.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing did not announce any new orders Tuesday, though Dubai's
Emirates airline has reportedly signed a letter of intent to buy
six of Boeing's 737-300 jets. At list prices, the order would be
worth about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus order from International Lease was for 62 of the
single-aisle A320 family of jets, and 20 of the widebody A330 jets.
</P>
<P>
   It was a follow on order to one announced earlier this year by
the leasing giant for 50 Airbus planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, the Airbus brand is accepted in the skies of
the world,'' Hazy said.
</P>
<P>
   The order includes five A3XX superjumbos, set to enter service
in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus has now announced 22 orders for its A3XX at the air show,
though none will become firm until after the plane is officially
launched.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and Airbus disagree about the size of the market for the
A3XX. Boeing agrees some airlines will buy the new jet, but not in
enough numbers to justify its development costs of about $12
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The A3XX, if launched, would bust Boeing's 30-year monopoly in
the market for planes with more than 400 seats that it has enjoyed
with the 747. Boeing is planning a stretch version of the 747 to
counter the Airbus threat.
</P>
<P>
   Hazy said International Lease will evaluate the 747 stretch.
</P>
<P>
   He said the analysis by International Lease shows that markets
served by the current 747-400 are growing from 5 to 12 percent a
year. Once those markets reach saturation in terms of frequency in
2005, bigger planes will be needed to handle the capacity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the order is important for Airbus, the five planes
represent only a small percentage of the leasing company's
portfolio of planes.
</P>
<P>
   Hazy said International Lease will have 250 widebody planes in
its portfolio by 2005, so the five A3XX jets will represent only
about 2 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   He called the order a ``modest'' and ``measured'' commitment to
the super jumbo.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it was sweet news for Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a company like ILFC selects the A3XX, we feel very
comfortable the plane is what the market wants,'' said John Leahy,
vice president of Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus also announced several small orders yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   British Midland said it will buy two A320s and Finnair said it
has ordered six of the A320 family of jets.
</P>
<P>
   And Kuwait Finance House, an Islamic financial institution and
the parent company of Aviation Lease and Finance Co., an aircraft
lessor based in Kuwait, announced intentions to purchase four
A320s.

DICK CHENEY: A WASHINGTON INSIDER WITH A KNACK FOR WORKING WITH
RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
 (With BUSH-CHENEY, BUSH-CHENEY-ASSESS) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The night allied warplanes began bombing Iraq in
1991, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney quietly flipped on CNN in his
third-floor Pentagon office, ordered Chinese take-out and sat back
alone to watch the Persian Gulf war unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was concerned about possible losses, but he was
tremendously calm,'' said one former top Cheney aide who was
briefly in the room. ``I asked him why he wasn't more nervous, and
he basically said that he was confident that everything was done
that needed to be done. Once the airplanes were in the air, we just
had to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Dick Cheney as his running mate, Gov. George W. Bush
has turned to an unflappable Washington insider whose easygoing
exterior masks a steely confidence, a man who, once he makes a
tough decision, never looks back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sort of chews on issues, and chews on them until he makes
his mind up, then he goes on and he doesn't second-guess himself,''
said former Secretary of State George P. Shultz. ``He has very good
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, who served 10 years in the House of Representatives
and four more as President George Bush's defense secretary, brings
stature, decisiveness and decades of government experience to a
campaign sometimes short on all three.
</P>
<P>
   But the real secret of Cheney's success may be his ability to
wrap his staunchly conservative ideology in a mantle of moderation
and civility to get people to trust him and get things done.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has a knack for working with political rivals, colleagues
say, which is why Democrats feel at ease with him, even though,
while in the House, he opposed abortion and gun control and
supported aid to Nicaraguan contras and President Ronald Reagan's
``Star Wars'' anti-missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Panetta, a former Democratic congressman and White House
chief of staff, recalled that Cheney was one Republican whom he
could confide in during sensitive budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any question he had conservative views, but he
was always someone you could deal with and talk to, and never one
to demagogue the issues,'' Panetta said. ``I trusted that what I
said would not be used against me in negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wyoming Republican has been a rising star in party circles
since he was President Gerald Ford's chief of staff, at the age of
34. But that political fire appeared to die out in 1995, when
Cheney ended a brief flirtation with his own presidential campaign
and became chief executive of Halliburton, an oil services and
construction company based in Dallas whose revenues have doubled,
to $14.7 billion, under his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   What remains in question is Cheney's ability to wage a punishing
presidential campaign. He is not an electrifying speaker. He is a
balding, overweight, middle-aged man who is not especially
telegenic, though he comes across solidly on television. Cheney
never faced a tough race in conservative Wyoming. And he abhors the
scorched-earth politics that came to characterize House Republicans
under Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick does not bring political sex appeal to the ticket,'' said
Bill Frenzel, a long-time friend and a former Republican
congressman from Minnesota. ``What he brings is the competence and
confidence that if anything happens to the president, the country
will have a competent vice president to step in.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's selection is the latest in a series of unexpected turns
that have shaped his personal life and political career.
</P>
<P>
   He is an Ivy League drop-out who later became a doctoral student
in political science. He was the No. 2 House Republican on the path
to possibly becoming speaker when President Bush plucked him from
Congress to run the Pentagon after the Senate rejected his first
choice, Sen. John Tower, R-Texas. He was a military neophyte,
avoiding the Vietnam War with student and parent deferments, who
steeped himself in military tactics and doctrine and became the
most pivotal defense secretary since Robert McNamara.
</P>
<P>
   As defense secretary, Cheney joined a national security team
that included Secretary of State James Baker, national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Under Cheney, 24,000 American troops invaded Panama in 1989 to
overthrown Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, it was Cheney who flew
to Saudi Arabia to present King Fahd with President Bush's offer to
send up to 200,000 American troops to the kingdom. He clashed with
Powell, who recommended keeping economic sanctions in place longer,
and prodded the military to draft a larger, more ambitious
counterattack against Iraqi forces.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, his stint as secretary was auspicious. A week
after taking over at the Pentagon in 1989, Cheney publicly
reprimanded the Air Force chief of staff, Larry D. Welch, for
privately discussing options for updating land-based nuclear
missiles with influential members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Cheney abruptly dismissed Welch's successor, Gen.
Michael J. Dugan, for publicly discussing contingency plans for
waging war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Even Powell, a close ally of Cheney's, was not above reproach.
Powell recalled in his memoirs that after one meeting with
President Bush during the gulf crisis, Cheney pulled him aside.
```Colin,' he said, `You're chairman of the Joint Chiefs. You're
not secretary of state. You're not the national security adviser
anymore. And you're not secretary of defense. So stick to military
matters.' He made it clear that I had taken liberty for license.''
</P>
<P>
   While Representative Cheney supported most of President Reagan's
military buildup, Secretary Cheney presided over a 25 percent cut
in the armed services and oversaw a bipartisan process to close
hundreds of military bases. He stunned military analysts by
canceling plans to build a $57 billion Navy attack plane, the A-12.
</P>
<P>
   He vigorously opposed allowing gay men and lesbians to serve
openly in the armed forces. But when a magazine revealed that his
longtime spokesman, Pete Williams, was gay, Cheney defended him:
``As long as they perform their professional responsibilities in a
responsible manner, their private lives are their business.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, discretion is a Cheney byword. When President Bush met
with his top foreign policy advisers during the gulf crisis, Baker
and Powell typically briefed their senior aides afterward. Not
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney was absolutely mum,'' said Paul D. Wolfowitz, the
third-ranking official at the Pentagon, who was forced to beg
colleagues from the State Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff for
a briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues say the perception of Cheney as boring
belies his wry sense of humor. After Jimmy Carter was elected
president and considered replacing the chief of staff's job with a
decentralized ``spoke-in-wheel'' system, Cheney left a broken
bicycle wheel in his office as a warning to the Carter team.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney had three mild heart attacks before age 48 and underwent
a quadruple coronary bypass operation more than a decade ago. Since
leaving the Pentagon, he has battled a weight problem, gaining as
much as 50 pounds. He is still an avid hunter, fisherman and hiker
in the Grand Tetons near his home in Jackson.

   Richard Bruce Cheney was born in Lincoln, Neb., on Jan. 30,
1941. But his father, an Agriculture Department soil conservation
agent, moved the family to Casper, Wyo., where young Dick became a
captain of his high school football team and president of his
senior class.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney received a scholarship to Yale University but dropped out
in his second year because of poor grades. He traveled around the
West, at one point laying power lines for an electric company,
before settling down at the University of Wyoming, earning
bachelor's and master's degrees in political science.
</P>
<P>
   He married his high school sweetheart, Lynne, a political
scholar and former head of the National Endowment for the
Humanities. The couple has two grown daughters, Mary and Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney entered graduate school at the University of Wisconsin
and, at 27, was selected for a one-year fellowship in the office of
the late Rep. William Steiger, Wis.-R.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney thrived in the political cauldron of Capitol Hill. When
President Nixon picked Rep. Donald Rumsfeld of Illinois to head the
Office of Economic Opportunity, Cheney sent him a 12-page
memorandum on how to run the agency. Impressed by Cheney's ideas
and audacity, Rumsfeld hired him to run the agency's congressional
affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   As happens so often with aspiring aides in Washington, Cheney
hitched himself to his powerful mentor's rising star for much of
the next decade. When Ford tapped Rumsfeld to become White House
Chief of Staff, Cheney went along as deputy.
</P>
<P>
   When Rumsfeld was named secretary of defense, Cheney, only 34,
replaced him at the White House, the youngest person ever to be
White House chief of staff. Dispensing with the perks of office,
Cheney commuted daily to Washington in his 10-year-old Volkswagen,
rather than a chauffeured government sedan.
</P>
<P>
   After Carter won the presidency in 1976, Cheney returned to
Wyoming a Washington insider seeking his own political identity. In
1978, he successfully ran for the first of six terms in the House
of Representatives. Cheney quickly rose within the Republican
leadership ranks and often acted as a trusted bridge between Young
Turks like Gingrich and the old Republican guard. Cheney's popular
touch extended beyond Washington's power corridors. William F.
Connelly Jr., a politics professor at Washington and Lee University
who was a congressional fellow in Cheney's office in 1985, recalled
a visit to Wyoming with him.
</P>
<P>
   A group of ranchers had demanded a meeting, angry over the
military's plan to use more grazing land to base MX nuclear
missiles. ``These big burly ranchers in sheepskin coats, including
one guy chewing a nail, were fit to be tied,'' Connelly said. ``But
Cheney just talked them down. He said, `Look, this is too important
to America's defense.'''

LYNNE CHENEY, AT HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AND TO HIS RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wyo., N.Y.)  (With BUSH-CHENEY) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Smiling alongside Dick Cheney in Texas on Tuesday
as he became Gov. George W. Bush's running mate was Cheney's high
school sweetheart and wife of 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Lynne Cheney, 58, is no ordinary political wife. She is an
unusually high-profile figure with a national reputation as a
passionate opponent of ``political correctness'' and a public
record that is even more conservative than her husband's.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities during
the Reagan and Bush administrations and later as a television,
newspaper and magazine commentator, Cheney was a cultural warrior
and darling of the right, accusing what she called cultural
relativists of taking over American art, literature and education.
She has become even more muscularly conservative during the Clinton
years, calling, for instance, for the endowment's elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is one of her party's most provocative figures, and some
Republicans thought she deserved a cabinet post in a new
administration and even belonged on the list of possible
vice-presidential picks for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is fantastic,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
``In fact, she was my wife's first choice. She has a very strong
conservative philosophy. She's just very attractive as a candidate
in her own right, which she's never been. But she certainly will be
a great helpmate to Dick Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Bush will be getting two for the price of one,
Lott replied, ``This is more like three for the price of one
because she is double good.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Cheney said she has made no secret of her own
political ambitions. Indeed, in announcing Dick Cheney as his
running mate, Bush singled her out, describing her as ``a leader in
education reform in all America, developing high standards and a
sound curriculum for our public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Cheney holds a doctorate in 19th-century British
literature. (She wrote her dissertation on the effect of Immanuel
Kant's ideas on the poetry of Matthew Arnold). She and her husband
wrote a history of eight speakers of the House and she later wrote
``Telling the Truth,'' a book in which she claimed that truth had
become less important than constructing politically motivated
stories.
</P>
<P>
   She has also written novels, one a historical novel about women
pioneers in the American West, another a political thriller about
Washington whose characters include a vice president who dies of
what she delicately calls ``carnal arrest'' while having sex with a
television newswoman.
</P>
<P>
   With a mother who was a deputy sheriff and a father who was an
engineer, Cheney attributes her sense of moral rectitude to her
upbringing in Casper, Wyo. ``You cannot be a good person in public
and a bad person in private,'' she once told an interviewer. ``They
would know in a small town.''
</P>
<P>
   At Natrona Country High School in Casper, she twirled a baton as
chief of the baton squad and reigned as homecoming queen; Dick
Cheney was the captain of the football team, senior class
president, and had, she once said, a terrific crew cut.
</P>
<P>
   As an English teacher at the University of Wyoming in 1978, she
filled in for her husband when he was running for the state's lone
House seat and suffered a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   While her husband served in the House and then as secretary of
defense, Lynne Cheney used her position as head of the NEH as a
platform for her increasingly conservative ideology.
</P>
<P>
   She was accused by many scholars of politicizing the endowment's
grant-making by favoring traditional over multicultural projects
and loading the endowment's peer review committees with
conservatives. She cut assistance to the financially strapped New
York Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bush administration, Cheney used a perch as a senior
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative
Washington think tank, to promote her vision for a more wholesome,
morally correct, educationally rigorous America. She also sometimes
sat in the conservative chair on the CNN television program
``Crossfire,'' where she denounced declining cultural standards,
especially in schools.
</P>
<P>
   She hates concept-based math education and school-to-work
programs, loves standardized achievement tests similar to those
adopted in other industrialized countries and has staked a middle
ground in the debate over English as the official language of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Her tart tongue extends beyond the realm of cultural and
educational issues. At a daylong panel at the AEI on Hillary Rodham
Clinton last spring, she criticized the first lady for maintaining
a false marital facade, citing the Clintons' habit of holding hands
in public. ``It is just so distressing to me,'' Cheney said.
Although she acknowledged that it was no one's business if Hillary
Clinton wanted to stay married to her husband, she added, ``What
drives me crazy is when Hillary acts as the happy wife.''

FIVE MIGHT BE MORE SCARY THAN FORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ask just about any course manager or head
professional and they will tell you that most golfers would sooner
give up a prime tee time than play fast and loose with the sport's
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   One significant change, however, seems to have been accepted
with relatively few objections. Many courses are promoting the
concept of fivesomes, in which five players are grouped together on
the course rather than the traditional four.
</P>
<P>
   The change is coming slowly but surely, with the intention of
increasing revenue for the courses by getting an extra greens fee
per every group. And the acceptance is not unanimous, as many
players bemoan the slower play.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, we don't get any real negative feedback,'' said
Adam Hill, assistant general manager at Vista Valencia Golf Course.
``Obviously people want to come out and have a good time, and it
doesn't seem to matter very much how many people are in the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get some complaints from people who think it slows down the
play, but not too many.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, courses do not force fivesomes on their players,
as they are largely a matter of circumstance. Groups of two and
three players are often paired together, but rarely is a single
player attached to an existing foursome.
</P>
<P>
   A small survey found that 30 percent of the groups sent out by
local golf courses are fivesomes. The number is significantly
higher for public courses, which need revenue more than private
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In public golf, there's pretty much no choice,'' said
Christopher Riddle, assistant general manager at Knollwood Country
Club in Granada Hills, a public course, who estimated that at least
half of his weekend groups end up as fivesomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of golf is going private and the public courses need
to keep up. Fivesomes get more people on the courses and they
increase the revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Fivesomes, which have become popular just in the past five years
or so, are forbidden on many private courses, which tend to be much
more tradition-conscious, even though many golfers are now choosing
to play in groups of five, rather than four.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that fivesomes slow down the pace of play, a point
which nobody can argue. Five players will take longer to play a
hole than four.
</P>
<P>
   Courses adjust their tee times to allow for more spacing between
groups, which some argue defeats the purpose of fivesomes because
they prevent fewer groups from playing the course.
</P>
<P>
   Still, course administrators feel that fivesomes are the way to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Longer rounds are the biggest complaint, but it's not a major
issue,'' Knollwood's Riddle said. ``Even when we send out fivesome
after fivesome after fivesome, it's still pretty evenly spaced out
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most courses have seven minutes between groups, and we have
eight, so I think that helps keep play spaced, but I don't think it
would be a problem anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three pretty long holes on the front nine, so by the
time they get to the fifth hole, there is generally a lot of
spacing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vista Valencia's Hill agrees, adding that players can be
``educated'' _ perhaps subtly encouraged to play a faster round,
and that although individual holes might be slower, the overall
time of a round does not significantly increase with a fivesome.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger challenge is convincing longtime golfers that five is
not a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people object to a fivesome, we will try to accommodate
them,'' Hill said. ``But when you have an 8 a.m. foursome that ends
up being three, and another foursome that ends up being two, it
only makes sense to put them together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to get people to change, especially in a sport like
golf, which is so entrenched in history. There are always going to
be sticklers who don't like new ideas and who have old-school
thoughts about how the game should be played, but I think you're
seeing a lot more people start to come around.''

   GONESSE, France _ A supersonic Air France Concorde carrying
mainly German tourists bound for a cruise ship in New York crashed
in flames shortly after take-off from Charles de Gaulle Airport
outside Paris Tuesday, killing all 109 passengers and crew on board
as well as at least four people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only crash of a Concorde since the world's first
supersonic passenger plane went into commercial operation in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses said one or both of the plane's left engines were
on fire and smoking heavily even as the aircraft sped down the
runway. They said it had failed to gain height, banked heavily to
the left and then crashed, demolishing a small hotel and restaurant
in Gonesse, a suburb nine miles north-east of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Air France identified the passengers on board the chartered
flight AF4590 as 96 Germans, two Danes, one Austrian and one
American, whose identity has so far not been disclosed, while the
nine crew members, three pilots and six stewardesses were all
French. French government officials said those killed in the hotel
included three staff members _ two Polish and one French _ and one
British tourist. Five others were reportedly injured, four of them
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The crash came just weeks after cracks were discovered in the
wings of several aging Concordes. Jean-Cyril Spinetta, the
president of Air France, said cracks had been found in four of the
airline's six Concordes, but not on the one that crashed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no possible link between the engine and these
cracks,'' he told reporters at scene. He added that the Concorde
that crashed Tuesday entered service in 1980 and had undergone a
mechanical check up as recently as last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft had been chartered by a German tour company, Peter
Deilmann Reederei GmbH &AMP; Co, based in the northern German town of
Neustadt. Deilmann, the company's chief executive, said the
Concorde's passengers were scheduled to join a luxury cruise ship,
``Deutschland,'' Tuesday evening in New York at the start of a
16-day tour of the Caribbean, traveling through the Panama Canal to
Manta in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the crash, which occurred here at 4:44 p.m.,
airport emergency trucks arrived on the scene to find flames and
smoke engulfing both the remains of the plane and the remnants of
the hotel, a wooden building called Hotelissimo. Dozens of police
vehicles and fire trucks soon arrived, and the area was immediately
cordoned off.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, with planes again leaving Charles de Gaulle
airport and flying over the wreckage, firemen were still trying to
put out the fire, which continued to spew thick, white smoke across
a nearby highway and wheat fields.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists who reached the area were kept at a distance of some
100 yards, but they could see darkened pieces of the plane's
fuselage as well as a solitary wheel and what looked like one of
the turbines. Only a tiny section of the 45-room hotel remained
standing, charred and ruined. The wreckage of the plane was
confined to a small area, a little larger than its own size,
seemingly confirming eyewitness reports that it fell on its left
side and tipped over on its back.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The crash and the minutes preceding it were witnessed by a
number of people, both at the airport and around Gonesse. Even now,
more than 30 years after the plane was unveiled as the pride of the
British and French aviation industries, passengers and airport
workers routinely turn their eyes toward the runway to watch the
aircraft's swan-like form take to the air. Tuesday was different
only because smoke and flames were spewed from the plane's engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hadn't left the ground and already it was on fire,'' said
Sylvie Lucas, who had gone to the airport to pick up her children,
who were on another flight. ``The flames were coming from the back
of the plane. We were waiting to hear the explosion because we
thought it was going to fall here.''
</P>
<P>
   A photograph of the ill-fated Concorde in the air, taken by a
young Hungarian plane-spotter, showed flames stretching some 60
feet behind the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Udel, a New York musician who had just finished touring
Europe with the Blue Brothers jazz band, said he looked up and saw
the Concorde on fire. ``It looked just like virtual reality,'' he
said. ``Of course, we all knew what it was. And there was nothing
on earth you could do. It looked like it was trying to ascend, but
its nose was down. First there was smoke, then there was fire, then
it just went nose in and all that was left was a white billowy
cloud.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses who watched the crippled plane as it flew toward
the southeast also anticipated the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw its rear engine in flames,'' said Samir Hossein, 15, a
student in Gonesse who was playing tennis at the time. ``We saw it
lose altitude, it chopped off those trees near the hotel and headed
to the ground. The pilot tried to bank, but the plane rolled over
and hit the hotel nose first and turned over.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who visited the scene of the crash
some two hours after the disaster, said the plane's pilots
apparently had time to signal an emergency because the runways at
both Charles de Gaulle and the nearby Le Bourget airports were
ordered cleared. ``But the plane could not return, even though it
tried,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Willy Corenthin, 29, an electrician who saw the crash as he
drove on a nearby highway, said he also heard an explosion while
the plane was still in the air. ``I saw smoke and flames coming
from the engines, then I heard an explosion, and the plane heaved
to the left and crashed,'' he said. ``When it fell, it seemed to
fall very slowly, then the smoke and flames erupted. I didn't hear
another explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the plane with a full fuel load demolished the small
building of the Hotelissimo hotel, it narrowly missed an adjacent
and larger hotel, Les Relais Bleus. The owner of Les Relais Bleus
said he saw the burning plane heading towards him and fled. If it
had continued another 300 yards, it would also have crashed into
the town of Gosenne, presumably causing many more deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had fallen on Gosenne, it would have been an
unbelievable disaster,'' said Corenthin, who echoed the views of
several local residents who felt the pilot had steered the plane
away from the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the pilot was trying to avoid more populated areas,''
said Christine Turpin, who saw the flaming plane flash by just 150
feet above her gasoline station. ``I think he was trying to get
back to the airport or land in a field.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, the French transport minister, Jean-Claude
Gayssot, said he had asked the civil aviation authority to cancel
all Concorde flights Wednesday. In London, a spokesman for British
Airways, the only airline apart from Air France to fly the plane,
said that Tuesday evening's flights to and from New York had also
been canceled. But a spokesman for the British Civil Aviation Board
said it had no intention of grounding the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, British Airways grounded one of its seven
Concordes after cracks were found in its wings, but the remaining
six in its supersonic fleet continue to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Britain's BAE Systems and France's Aerospatiale
Matra, the successors to the companies that built the aircraft,
said they were forming a joint investigating team. The U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board said it was also sending an
investigator to Paris to work with the French team.
</P>
<P>
   Experts from Rolls-Royce, the manufacturer of the engines, were
traveling to Paris to investigate the apparent failure of one or
two of the plane's four Olympus 593 engines.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France as well as Jospin expressed
condolences to the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, who in
turn noted that ``Germany and France are united in their horror
over the accident, in mourning for the victims and in sympathy for
the families.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also spoke of the crash Tuesday. ``Like all of
you,'' he told reporters, ``I have just heard the news of the crash
of the Concorde outside Paris, and I wanted to extend the deepest
condolences of the American people to the families of those who are
lost.''

<P>
   The Concorde, which can fly at 1,350 miles per hour at some
60,000 feet above sea-level, has long been regarded by France as
proof of its technological prowess. Even though supersonic travel
never caught on widely, it has been a favorite of prosperous
businessmen and show business personalities who welcome being able
to cross the Atlantic in around half the time _ just three and a
half hours _ of regular commercial flights. For the convenience,
roundtrip tickets can cost up to $11,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Concorde only makes the return flight to New York three
times a day _ once from Paris and twice from London _ its aura of
romance and luxury has made it popular for charter by travel groups
catering to the well-heeled.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the plane, which was first flown in tests in 1969,
has had a good safety record, albeit with sporadic difficulties. In
January, two British Airways Concordes made emergency landings
within a 24-hour period, one after an engine switched off, the
other after a fire alarm went off in the cockpit. On at least three
occasions, the rubber tires on the Concorde's landing gear have
exploded upon landing. But in those and other incidents, no
passenger has ever been injured.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Air France has predicted that its fleet of
Concordes would continue flying until at least 2007.

COHEN SAYS U.S. MISSILE PLAN CAN'T SUCCEED WITHOUT NATO SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The proposed national missile defense system cannot
succeed unless the United States persuades its NATO allies to drop
their opposition, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In order for the anti-missile shield to protect all 50 states,
at a potential cost of $60 billion, it must rely on radar stations
abroad, Cohen said, mostly likely in Britain and in Greenland,
which is territory of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks before he is to make a recommendation to President
Clinton on whether to proceed with the system, Cohen said that a
top priority must be to persuade NATO allies to embrace the
project. But many of them have voiced serious concern that the plan
could upset the nuclear balance or set off a new global arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to have a technologically effective system, we need
to have the support of our allies,'' Cohen said. Without X-band
radars overseas, he added, ``you can't see the missiles coming.
Therefore, your interceptors really are not worth very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's remarks to the Senate Armed Services Committee were his
first since the critical failure on July 8 of a high-speed missile
interceptor to properly deploy. Of three tests of the intercept
system carried out so far, this was the second failure for the
complex weapons system that relies on a high-tech web of targeting
radar, homing sensors and communications links.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen hinted that the two test failures might slow down the
entire deployment process. The setbacks ``called into question the
realism'' of having a system in place by the current target date of
2005, but he said the date should remain a goal for a limited
shield of 20 interceptors and the X-band radar.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the principal U.S. allies in Europe and Asia
oppose the missile defense system. They argue that its efficacy is
unproven and that it could undermine the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty with Russia, which has been a mainstay of global arms
control since 1972. These allies also worry that the plan could
encourage China and some other nations to beef up their limited
long-range arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen told senators that administration officials are gradually
breaking through that opposition, though no nation has asked to
join the system, and only Australia has expressed support for it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The allies share the threat the U.S. system is designed to
address, Cohen said: long-range missile attacks from such nations
as North Korea, Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO allies embrace the project, he predicted, Russia would
feel compelled to drop its opposition to amending the ABM treaty.
``Thus far,'' he said, ``I believe the Russians have devoted
themselves to trying to divide the allies from supporting the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen acknowledged that Clinton has failed to persuade Moscow
that the missile shield would not neutralize Russia's arsenal. The
defense secretary said that President Vladimir Putin's proposal to
work with NATO on a defense that intercepts missiles in the initial
boost phase of flight ``cannot be a substitute'' for the
anti-missile shield and would rely on even less proven technology.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that China would probably increase its
intercontinental missile capability regardless of whether the
United States proceeds on missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to decide this year whether to break ground
on the project. Troubled by Defense Department predictions that
North Korea could develop missiles capable of reaching the United
States by 2005, Congress last year approved a law requiring
deployment of a missile defense system as soon as it was
technologically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia and other nations must understand that the United
States policy now calls for an eventual deployment of a system to
protect ourselves,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the chairman of
the Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than decide on full-scale deployment, Clinton will limit
his decision to whether to begin construction next spring of a
radar station on Shemya island in Alaska, Cohen said. That would
leave it to the next president to determine the scope of the
project, he said. Vice President Al Gore, the probable Democratic
presidential nominee, generally supports the Clinton approach,
while Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican nominee, favors a
more robust system.
</P>
<P>
   By restricting his decision in that way, Clinton might leave to
his successor the contentious issue of withdrawing from the ABM
treaty, a move that requires six months notice from either side.
Administration lawyers argue that the United States will not be in
violation of the treaty until crews lay the rails for the radar
system, which is not expected until March 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who wants to defer the decision to
permit more study, anticipated that debate. ``A unilateral decision
to withdraw from the ABM Treaty could unleash an offensive arms
race and create major new proliferation problems,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the administration is determined to deprive hostile
nations of the ability to blackmail the United States with the
threat of a missile attack. He downplayed overtures by the North
Korean government to negotiate terms to end its long-range missile
program and the historic June meeting between the leaders of North
and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Kim Jong Il of North Korea, Cohen observed: ``One
summit doesn't change the tiger into a domestic cat.''

NEW U.S. GUARDS PROMISED AGAINST STEEL IMPORT SURGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration plans to take aggressive
new steps to protect domestic steel producers from import surges,
speeding up its use of antidumping measures and providing faster
relief for companies and workers, according to a report the
administration will release Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 240-page report seems timed to help Vice President Al Gore
shore up political support from steel workers and unions. Some
union leaders sharply criticized Gore's support for the China trade
bill earlier this year, and many have expressed disappointment that
the Clinton administration has not done more to guard against
sudden increases in low-price steel imports in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared by the Commerce Department, said the
administration would start imposing duties on imported steel faster
than it has in the past _ and in some case even before reaching a
final judgment on whether a foreign country is selling steel in
this market below cost _ in order to minimize the damage inflicted
on domestic companies and workers when dumping does occur.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had also requested funding to
set up an interagency ``rapid response team'' that would distribute
aid to hard-hit communities as soon as it becomes clear that a
sudden rise in import volumes threatens profits and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the United States' leading trading partners, including
Japan, South Korea, Russia and Brazil, have complained bitterly
about American antidumping laws, especially as used to shield the
politically sensitive steel industry. The administration's pledge
to use those laws more proactively seems sure to inflame already
tense trade ties with those nations, and especially with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, foreign steel producers released their own
study that contended the American restrictions on imported steel
had cost consumers here as much as $150 billion over the last three
decades. Trade barriers and government subsidies effectively raise
the cost of everything with steel components, from aircraft to
kitchen utensils, according to that study, which was prepared by
lawyers for foreign steel makers.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department's study makes essentially the opposite
claim: If anything, it suggests, the United States has erred on the
side of free trade in the past, and needs to speed up and stiffen
its response when the industry faces unfair competition from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The United States imposed antidumping duties on hot rolled steel
from Russia, Japan and Brazil in 1998. The administration decided
at the time that the United States was flooded with below-cost
steel after the Asian financial crisis that began in 1997 led to
devalued currencies and bankrupt companies abroad. Some steel
industry and union officials have complained that it took the
Clinton administration too long to respond to that crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is designed to make sure that what happened to the
industry two years ago doesn't happen again,'' a senior Commerce
official said. ``We want to move as fast and as aggressively as we
can, because we know that it takes time for the remedies to work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the report says, the administration will act
faster to break out and distribute trade data on steel. That will
help people spot evidence of potential import surges. When surges
occur, the administration will act faster to head them off, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
   Among the actions the report recommends: initiating bilateral
negotiations with trading partners as soon as it becomes clear that
an import surge is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that the administration will work to
address long-term ``structural factors'' that cause foreign
countries to sell steel at what the United States has determined is
below the cost of production.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, the report says, has allowed steel exporters to escape
paying bills at home, allowing them to sell goods abroad below
cost. Japan allows steel makers to coordinate with one another and
keep prices artificially high at home to help promote low-priced
exports. South Korea has unsound banking practices that have
effectively subsidized a glut of steel production capacity in that
country.
</P>
<P>
   The administration will use its influence at the World Bank and
other international lending agencies to end loans that expand steel
production capacity, the study says. It will also propose that
international economic bodies study how best to knock down informal
barriers that protect and subsidize steel companies.

TEXAS BUSINESS CLIMATE LUCRATIVE FOR CHENEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BUSH-CHENEY)  
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The business climate of Texas _ entrepreneurial, energy-based
and big _ has been lucrative for both George W. Bush and his
running mate, Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the sale of an ownership stake in the Texas Rangers
baseball team netted a profit of $14.9 million two years ago _ from
an investment of $606,000 nine years before. And with a legendary
Texas financier, Richard E. Rainwater, as his investment adviser,
Bush has had investment income of more than $1 million a year in
the last two years, in addition to his $115,345 salary as Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   For Cheney, the numbers are even bigger. In 1995, when he went
to Texas to become chief executive of the Halliburton Co., a Dallas
oil services company, he received an annual salary and bonus of
$1.3 million to $3 million, along with stock options, Halliburton
shares and other forms of compensation.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Cheney owns 1,089,000 shares of Halliburton, including
shares he owns outright and 860,000 options to purchase Halliburton
shares at a reduced price. With Halliburton trading at about $40 a
share, his stake has a market value of about $40 million, although
he would net somewhat less than that depending on the financial
terms of the options he holds.
</P>
<P>
   Just this year, when Halliburton's stock was trading at a
52-week high, Cheney dipped into his Halliburton holdings and sold
100,000 shares at $50.97 a share. That transaction, on May 31,
netted Cheney $5,097,000. It also took place just before
Halliburton's stock began to fall to its current range.

BARAK HEADS HOME TO AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS; see also MIDEAST-ADVISORY for complete list of
stories.) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak flew home from the breakup
of the Camp David summit on Tuesday to a murky political future,
his patchwork coalition in tatters, his country sharply divided
over the startling new discussion of ceding parts of Jerusalem to
some form of Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   As news spread that the Camp David summit had ended without
agreement, the airwaves were filled with the speculation of
analysts and politicians. Would there be a national unity
government, bringing in Barak's right-wing Likud critics? New
elections? Violence from the Palestinians?
</P>
<P>
   The entire country seemed to tune in to Barak's Washington press
conference. Peppered with questions from Israeli journalists, the
prime minister himself made light of the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least let me get on the plane and we'll think on the way,''
he joked. ``We will even consult with our journalist friends on the
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, more seriously, he added: ``There is no doubt that all of
the options are open. We will have to consider the issues seriously
and assess the situation. We are at the end of a very important
chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither the discussions at the summit nor the public debate in
Israel were marginal issues. We will deliberate on arriving in
Israel what is the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who has been in office only a year, lost his
parliamentary majority in the 120-seat Israeli parliament on the
eve of the Camp David meeting, when two orthodox religious parties
_ Shas, which represents Sephardic Jews, and the National Religious
Party _ along with former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky's
right-leaning party of recent Russian immigrants, quit the
governing coalition to protest the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The grim picture is further complicated by a vote scheduled for
Aug. 2 _ the last day before the parliament leaves on a three-month
vacation _ on dissolving the legislature and calling new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Barak actually may be returning in a good position,
according to Sever Plotzker, a political commentator for the
newspaper Yediot Ahronoth, which has been doing extensive polling
in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Altogether, he is coming home in a very special situation,''
Plotzker said in a telephone interview. ``He has no government, a
weak coalition. But in my personal opinion he is stronger in the
past few weeks and after Camp David, all our polls show this. He is
coming back stronger. The economy is good and people are seeing
progress toward peace. He is sticking to his agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, told Israeli
reporters that ``as soon as he returns, Barak will be busying
himself with the composition of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Barak's One Israel parliamentary faction began backroom
maneuvering on Tuesday afternoon to kill the bill calling for new
elections, which is sponsored by two members of the right-wing
Likud Party. If the effort to kill the bill succeeds, Barak's
supporters could bain themselves three months while parliament is
on vacation. Barak's problems are largely due to the electoral
changes put in place in 1996, by which Israelis vote separately for
the prime minister and the members of parliament. That has resulted
in a profusion of smaller parties representing special interests,
particularly the Orthodox. While Barak got a strong mandate in the
popular vote, he had to turn to these smaller parties _ sometimes
with contradictory goals _ to form a governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system has created increasing fragmentation which makes
any coalition unwieldy and unmanageable,'' said Joseph Alpher, a
political analyst. ``This has been a constant in Barak's case.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Alpher, who has been a special adviser to Barak
during the peace talks, had the prime minister reached an agreement
of major proportions, he would not have been able to get it through
the parliament and would have faced new elections anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Barak now has several options, Alpher said. He could try to
continue to pursue the peace process, possibly with a renewed
summit in late August, to maintain momentum. He could move to a
national unity movement with the Likud party, which would signal at
least a time-out in negotiations. Or he could try to reconstitute
the basic elements of his coalition, probably without the National
Religious Party and Sharansky's group.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these options are extremely difficult,'' Alpher said.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, Yisrael Harel, a Jewish settler from Ofra and
onetime chairman of the settler's council, took a dim view of
Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I see it, he has a problem with both sides, both the left
and the right,'' Harel said in a telephone interview. ``The left
thinks he should have conceded more including in Jerusalem. For the
right, after he has conceded the Jordan valley, the settlements,
neighborhoods of Jerusalem, it's no longer possible.''
</P>
<P>
   On the left, Prof. Yaron Ezrachi of Hebrew University said
Barak's future was a difficult question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this moment there is a great, deep sense of
disappointment in his natural constituency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem to me there is no alternative to the peace
efforts even if there is a spurt of violence, so the peace effort
will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky, who had been the minister of interior, then set up a
protest tent outside the prime minister's office two weeks ago,
issued a statement calling for a national unity government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under today's conditions, the agreement that would have been
reached at Camp David would have torn Israeli society apart from
the inside and would have been disastrous for Israel's national
interests,'' the statement said in apparent relief at the summit's
failure, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, more than ever, when Israel faces fateful decisions to
its future, Mr. Barak must extend a hand to the heads of the
opposition in Israel to set up a National Unity government. Only a
government representing a broad national consensus, with clearly
defined red lines, can make critical decisions for the future of
the state of Israel.''

` AN INVISIBLE SIGN OF MY OWN ':  A DARK MATH OF THE MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a novel that begins with the word ``so.'' So. It is at
once a word, a sentence and a paragraph, followed by a mysterious
parable about a kingdom in which nobody dies, so ... the king
demands that someone from every family volunteer to die.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Aimee Bender establishes from the outset a tone
of casual, offhand intimacy, but the fairy tale-like parable, whose
themes are mortality, self-sacrifice and dismemberment, is not so
simple. And neither is Bender's intriguing ``An Invisible Sign of
my Own,'' which pursues a course through the charmingly deformed
personality of its narrator, evoking as it goes the dark themes of
the parable in the first few pages of the book.
</P>
<P>
   Bender, whose previous book, ``The Girl in the Flammable
Skirt,'' was a collection of slightly screwy young women and their
slightly screwy predicaments, offers us a 20-year-old narrator
named Mona in this, her first full-length novel. Mona is a math
teacher at the grammar school in the small town where she lives,
the previous holder of the job having decamped for Paraguay to
become a revolutionary. She is somewhat beyond screwy. In fact,
Mona is positively psychotic.
</P>
<P>
   Mona is good at a lot of things, but has quit all but one of
them. When she feels sexual or romantic attraction, she eats soap,
which, as can be imagined, successfully distracts her. Once, when
her running coach _ track stardom is one of the things she has quit
_ asks her why she has stopped competing, she answers, ``I quit
because winning is lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bender's purpose is broader than some clinical depiction of
a mental disorder. It is to allow the darkness of the human soul to
seep through the airiness of appearances, to show a small cast of
characters afflicted by terrors unseen to others. In this sense,
``An Invisible Sign of My Own'' is witty and engaging; it is tinged
with a kind of gothic horror and it is certainly stylistically
nimble. And yet it does not entirely succeed in realizing its
purpose, for two reasons: it is too often defeated by the willful
childishness of its characters and, more important, it slides to a
happy, Hollywood, love-conquers-all sort of ending that is
inconsistent with the spiritual darkness of its overall vision.
</P>
<P>
   The story weaves together several strands in Mona's life. She
has been asked by the elementary school's principal to become the
math teacher, even though she is very young and has no experience.
But math, as Mona puts it, was ``the one thing I loved but never
quit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mix up some numbers and signs,'' she adds, ``and you get an
equation for the way the wind shifts or an axiom for the movement
of water, or the height of someone, or for how skin feels.'' Math,
in other words, has the controllable orderliness that Mona craves,
and being a math teacher would seem to be her perfect job.
</P>
<P>
   But then the 14 members of Mona's second-grade math class enter
the picture; they are an obstreperous and troubled lot, children
whose tormented souls mirror Mona's own. Mona asks each pupil to
take something to class that represents a number _ she herself
takes an ax that she bought at the hardware store on her birthday,
and it becomes the number 7. One boy takes a 1 in the form of the
severed arm of his father, which has been encased in glass. Another
girl makes a zero out of an intravenous feeding tube, since her
mother is in the hospital, dying of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Just as what Mona calls `Numbers and Materials' &UR;  &LR; illustrates the
deformities in the lives and minds of her pupils, Mona herself is
shown to have problems outside of school. Since she was 10 years
old, her father has been afflicted with an unidentifiable disease,
a condition that both angers and worries her. She notices weird
behavior around her, especially behavior involving numbers, like
that of the school's former math teacher, who now runs a hardware
store and wears a number around his neck to indicate his mood. She
falls in love with the science teacher at school (who asks his
students to act as if they have dread diseases), but when the
moment comes for her to demonstrate her love, her primal fear of
success takes over and she disappears into the bathroom to eat soap
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Bender treats us to many illustrations of her
cleverness with words. ``In the street, two orange cones had tipped
over, vivid and isosceles,'' Mona notes at one point. Later,
sitting in a movie theater with the science teacher: ``My hands
were silent in my lap and I began to cloak the air around myself,
heavying it, thickening it with aggression and glamour, red velvet
breathing, and I made the air seethe off me, onto him, to make him
look over again; I wanted to force him to look over just by the
power of my will.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are also passages of ultra-cuteness that show Bender
losing her grip on her character's own burdened mental world. Mona
tells us of some neighbors who moved to Florida after their newborn
baby died, and that she used to make detours to the cemetery to
visit its grave. ``Hi baby, I said to it, this is your big sister
here. I figured it wouldn't know the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything in Mona's world, all the disparate people and events
that she has been keeping track of in her obsessive way, comes
together in a shocking incident in school, the exact nature of
which it would be unfair to disclose. Let's just say that in it the
children act out Mona's own fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   But strangely, everything just as quickly turns out right, for
no particular reason, though with some maneuvering by a sadder and
wiser Mona. Bender's ending has a kind of tacked-on quality, as if
she herself is not quite sure where the various afflictions of her
characters _ children who don't act like children, and grown-ups
who do _ should take them, or as if she herself is terrified by
their tragic potential.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``An Invisible Sign of My Own'' is an intelligent and
engaging work by a recent arrival on the literary scene, with a
fanciful and original take on the quietly helter-skelter world that
lies within. &QL;

 &HT;    Concorde crash echoes 1962 Paris air disaster
 &HT;    By Andrea Jones
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The Tuesday crash of an Air France Concorde en route
to New York echoed another Paris air disaster that decimated the
Atlanta arts community nearly 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On June 3, 1962, an Air France Boeing 707 crashed and burned
during an aborted takeoff at Orly airfield in Paris. Of the 129
killed, 114 were Georgians, many of whom were prominent Atlantans
concluding a month-long tour of major European art centers.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen, who flew to Paris the night of
the crash to help identify the dead, said Tuesday that the Concorde
disaster stirred memories from that terrible time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about the crash every time a plane falls from the
sky,'' Allen, 89, said. ``This one seemed particularly similar and
tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 111 Atlantans aboard the 1962 flight were the
cultural and civic leaders of the city. The group was organized by
the women's committee of the Atlanta Art Association in part to
attract new members.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he lost some of his closet friends in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terribly sad time for Atlanta, and really for the
world,'' he said. ``It was a distinguished and influential group of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash galvanized city leaders to form the Atlanta Arts
Alliance and build the Atlanta Memorial Arts Center, dedicated in
1968 in memory of crash victims. The center was later renamed for
philanthropist Robert Woodruff in honor of a $4 million donation.
</P>
<P>
   The French government also honored victims with a donation of a
copy of Rodin's statue ``The Shade.'' The sculpture is on display
at the High Museum.

BIOTECH GIANT FILES SUIT IN BATTLE FOR PATENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass.)  By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A second biotechnology giant, Genzyme Corp., has filed a patent
infringement suit against Transkaryotic Therapies Inc., the upstart
company locked in a closely watched patent battle with Amgen Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme said Tuesday that it had filed suit in U.S. District
Court in Wilmington, Del., accusing Transkaryotic, which is usually
called TKT, of infringing on a patent covering the production of an
enzyme to treat Fabry disease, a rare inherited disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Transkaryotic and Genzyme, both based in Cambridge, Mass., are
in a race to be first to market with the enzyme, known as
alpha-galactosidase. TKT applied for marketing approval from the
Food and Drug Administration on June 16 and Genzyme followed a week
later. If not blocked by the patent lawsuit, TKT's drug, which it
calls Replagal, is expected to be the company's first product.
</P>
<P>
   TKT has developed a technique for making biotechnology drugs
that it says avoids the patents held by industry giants. Instead of
splicing the human gene for a protein into bacteria or hamster
cells, which is the conventional approach, TKT turns on the
inactive gene in human cells. In a trial already under way in
Boston, Amgen is trying to stop TKT from using this technique to
produce a version of Amgen's huge-selling anemia drug,
erythropoietin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is not clear that TKT is using the controversial
technique to produce its drug for Fabry disease. The company has
never said how it is making Replagal and might be using more
conventional recombinant DNA. But Genzyme said its patent covers
both methods.
</P>
<P>
   TKT said it did not infringe and thought the Genzyme patent was
invalid. ``It is a shame that Genzyme has chosen to compete based
on a frivolous lawsuit rather than on the merits of their
products,'' Dr. Richard F. Selden, TKT's chief executive, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   People with Fabry disease have a deficiency of the
alpha-galactosidase enzyme and therefore cannot break down certain
fats, which then accumulate in the lining of the blood vessels in
the kidney, heart and other organs. The condition can cause pain,
numbness, kidney failure and heart disease. Death typically occurs
about age 40.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme estimates that only 2,000 to 4,000 people suffer from
the disease worldwide. But even such a small number of patients can
mean high revenue if there is no competition and the drug price is
high. Genzyme's leading product, a drug called Cerezyme, which
treats another rare inherited disorder called Gaucher disease, has
annual sales of about $500 million. Even though only 3,000 patients
are taking the drug, each one is paying about $170,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The filing of the lawsuit was announced after the markets
closed. Shares of TKT fell $1.75, to $30.375. Shares of Genzyme
General, the division of Genzyme that is developing the Fabry drug,
fell 85.9375 cents, to $68.3125. &QL;

ADVERTISING: GM UNITES MEDIA PLANNING AT NEW SHOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Revises and expands with additional information and quotes; story
grows by   about 700 words)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest assignment in the history of Madison Avenue was made
Tuesday when General Motors consolidated responsibilities for media
planning _ deciding where to run ads with an annual budget of $2.9
billion _ at a new shop to be formed by a unit of the giant agency
company known as the B Com3 Group.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation of media planning under the unit, the Starcom
MediaVest Group, came after a monthlong review of three contenders
and will affect all GM brands sold in the United States except Saab
and Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can imagine, this is a huge undertaking for us,''
Michael A. Browner, executive director for media and marketing
operations at General Motors Corp. in Detroit, said in a conference
call to reporters to announce the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Media planning is taking on additional strategic importance as
marketers seek to increase the long odds that a potential customer
_ busy with life and bored by most ads _ will pay attention to a
sales pitch, particularly when many products are aimed at narrow
demographic groups rather than mass audiences.
</P>
<P>
   One way media planning works is to use tools like consumer
research to try tailoring media schedules to the tastes of would-be
buyers so they are more likely to encounter the ads, whether
watching television, listening to the radio, surfing the Internet,
passing by billboards or reading a newspaper or magazine. Another
way media planning tries to improve the chances that consumers will
see ads is to have them appear in unexpected places, from store
floors and plastic bags wrapped around dry cleaning to elevators
and airport baggage carousels.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do our job well, the effectiveness of our advertising
will be improved by putting ads in better places at better times,''
Browner said, ``making sure we can reach more of the target
audience more effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to select Starcom MediaVest was made by a committee
of seven high-ranking GM marketing and advertising executives.
There were two other agencies under consideration in the review:
Interpublic Group of Cos. and Carat North America, part of Aegis
Group.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by GM to consolidate media planning at a standalone
shop came seven years after the company, the nation's largest
advertiser and largest automaker, consolidated media buying _ the
negotiations to determine how much ads will cost _ at GM Mediaworks
in Warren, Mich., formed by Interpublic at GM's request.
</P>
<P>
   The creative duties for GM brands remain at the various agencies
now handling those tasks, including Starcom MediaVest siblings like
Leo Burnett in Chicago and D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles in Troy,
Mich., as well as Interpublic agencies like Campbell-Ewald in
Warren and McCann-Erickson in Troy. The creative agencies had also
been handling media planning for their particular brands; so, for
instance, Burnett took care of creative and planning tasks for
Oldsmobile and D'Arcy did the same for Cadillac and Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of consolidation is to wring additional economies from
the elaborate planning and buying processes that lead to the
delivery of ads to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Efficiencies come from improved effectiveness in the
marketplace,'' said John G. Middlebrook, vice president and general
manager for vehicle brand marketing at GM, during the conference
call.
</P>
<P>
   That will best be accomplished, he added, by ``the formation of
a dedicated media-planning operation, tentatively titled GM
Planworks,'' to consolidate the national and regional
brand-planning duties that had been divided among 17 agencies. The
responsibilities had been about evenly divided between agencies
owned by B Com3 and Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   Starcom MediaVest will form GM Planworks _ in Detroit or a
nearby suburb _ to handle the media planning for brands that
include Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, Cadillac and GMC.
Currently, more than 200 people handle those planning tasks,
developing and producing media schedules for each brand based on
the intended audience for each car, minivan or truck. GM Planworks,
which is to be fully operating by the first quarter of 2001, is to
have 150 to 200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about trying to raise the bar higher,'' said Jack
Klues, chief executive at Starcom MediaVest, which was formed by B
Com3 in May by merging Starcom Worldwide, affiliated with Burnett,
with MediaVest Worldwide, affiliated with D'Arcy. Other Starcom
MediaVest clients include Coca-Cola, Philip Morris and Procter &AMP;
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always admired and respected'' the performance of GM
Mediaworks, he added. ``Now our goal and purpose is to deliver that
same quality of work from a strategic planning perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Carat North America, unlike Starcom MediaVest and Interpublic,
has not handled media planning for GM. But the chief executive
there, David Verklin, is well known to the automaker for his work
at the San Francisco agency now known as Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney,
which handles creative and media planning assignments for Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two `inside' competitors and the one `outside' competitor
all came in with an equal opportunity to win the assignment,''
Browner said, adding that the criteria by which Starcom MediaVest
was chosen included ``the successes the agency has had for GM as
well as with other companies'' and ``its strategic media
research.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had no dissatisfaction with the quality of the media
plans done for our brands by the individual agencies,'' Browner
said. ``But we should benefit from the integration across the
brands, the shared learning when you've got best-in-class
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Riney continues to handle media planning for Saturn and the
Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., owned by Interpublic, continues to
handle media planning for Saab.  &QC;

`NEW WATERFORD GIRL': AN EDGY TAKE ON SMALL-TOWN BLUES
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  Mooney Pottie (her given name is Agnes Marie) is a dreamy, bookish
teen-ager living in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, in the mid-1970s and
longing to be anywhere else. Life in her close-knit, conservative
small town seems unbearably drab; even the riot of ill-matched
plaids that seems to be New Waterford's idea of fashion can't
overcome its essential grayness. This is the kind of place where
thrift and common sense dictate that a shotgun wedding at the local
church double as a funeral, in spite of the inconvenience of
sorting out condolence cards from congratulations. No wonder Mooney
dreams of Rome, Paris and above all, New York.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years ago Allan Moyle, who directed this quirky, charming
movie from Tricia Fish's eagle-eyed script, made ``Pump Up the
Volume,'' a cheerfully incendiary fable of teen-age rebellion
starring Christian Slater as an insurgent boy disc jockey. While
the look and setting of his new picture are different, ``New
Waterford Girl,'' which opens today at Film Forum, is animated by a
similarly feisty spirit. It's about a young girl's struggle for
independence against the forces _ her parents, her town, the way
things are _ that rein her in.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly a new story, but the filmmakers' sense of local
color, their springy, disjointed narrative style and a general
refusal on their part or the actors' to stoop to caricature give
this version a freshness and intensity that recall the television
series ``My So-Called Life.'' Liane Balaban, an 18-year-old from
Toronto making her first film appearance in the role of Mooney, is
like an angrier, more angular Winona Rider. She captures both
Mooney's worldliness and her naivete as she tries out poses and
attitudes on her uncomprehending family.
</P>
<P>
   These include her two older sisters, who are full of confused
and confusing information about sex, sin and social acceptability;
a harried mother (Mary Walsh), and a good-humored dad (Nicholas
Campbell), who has an impossible dream of his own: to watch his
hockey game in peace and quiet. It would have been easy to make the
elder Potties into small-minded clowns or repressed ogres, but
Fish, helped by these two fine actors, allows us to catch glimpses
of the world of work, family and local pride they inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   Mooney's allies are Cecil Sweeney, a gloomy schoolteacher
(Andrew McCarthy, majestically coiffed in full pompadour and
three-inch sideburns), and Lou Benzoa, a pugnacious neighbor (Tara
Spencer-Nairn). Both are outsiders, thrown up on the shores of Cape
Breton for reasons the script doesn't entirely explain.
</P>
<P>
   Lou is the daughter of a disgraced New York boxer (her mother is
played by Cathy Moriarty, in quiet tribute to her role as Jake
LaMotta's wife, Vickie, in ``Raging Bull'' 20 years ago), and she
uses her inherited pugilistic skill to take revenge on the
two-timing, sweet-talking men of New Waterford. She and Mooney,
cruising through town in a beat-up car, are like a maritime Thelma
and Louise, all fired up with nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   But Mooney has noticed that a select group of local girls _ the
unwed, pregnant ones _ manage to escape as far as Antigonish, where
their babies are given up for adoption. So Mooney conceives, as it
were, an elaborate plan to trash her reputation; to transform
herself from the town nerd to the town slut. In its second half,
``New Waterford Girl,'' which had been a meandering tour of its
locale, accelerates into a comedy of sexual misunderstanding _ not
the least of which is Mooney's own incomprehension of sexual
matters.
</P>
<P>
   The soundtrack, meanwhile, outdoes ``The Virgin Suicides'' in
its devotion to the great bad music of the 1970s. Perhaps out of a
desire for absolute authenticity, perhaps in order to meet
Canadian-content requirements, there is a heavy emphasis on bands
like April Wine and A Foot in Cold Water. There is also a welcome,
if anachronistic, performance by the present-day Cape Breton fiddle
sensation Ashley MacIsaac, and an a cappella rendition of an old
sea chantey _ sly reminders that out-of-the-way places are not
necessarily cultural backwaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Waterford Girl'' is being shown with ``When the Day
Breaks,'' an animated short film by Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis
that sketches a landscape of urban disconnection populated by farm
animals. The story, a curious mixture of somberness and whimsy,
involves the chance encounter between a shy pig dressed in
kerchief, cloth coat and sensible shoes, and a brusque,
business-suited chicken.

NEWS ANALYSIS: DESCENDING THE SUMMIT INTO VALE OF UNCERTAINTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ And on the 15th day, the Israelis and the
Palestinians packed their bags and left their pastoral retreat at
Camp David empty-handed, exhausted and still in conflict. In
immediate retrospect, the hope that they could have resolved a
52-year-old, blood-soaked dispute in a fortnight seems like the
summit of idealism.
</P>
<P>
   With the potential for violence looming, what happens now to
this prizefight of all ethnic, religious and territorial conflicts?
The Palestinians entered swinging, and the Israelis left swinging,
and while the American referees bounced quickly back to their feet,
it is unclear when and if the two sides will re-enter the ring. In
the end, did the meeting help or hurt the peace effort?
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton described it on his return to the White
House Tuesday, he believed that he was compelled to force the issue
by convening the talks. After seven years of stop-and-start peace
negotiations, with the threat of an impending return to violent
conflict, there was no longer any reason to avoid an official
grappling with the thorniest points. It was time for a moment of
reckoning, for the leaders to stare at themselves in the mirror and
also face ``the abyss,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But before the Camp David meeting, Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, repeatedly said that the moment had not
arrived, that the talks were premature, that the groundwork had not
been laid. Perhaps he should have been heeded. As Prime Minister
Ehud Barak repeated Tuesday, it does take two to tango.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and U.S. officials knew that in general, Arafat makes no
decision before its time, and Arafat's personal working deadline is
Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   That is when the most recent interim peace agreement expires,
and when the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership has
pledged to unilaterally declare a state if a permanent peace has
not been reached _ an action that could provoke a chain of
unilateral actions and violent events.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the best possible face on the meeting's failure to
produce an agreement, Clinton asserted that the Israelis and
Palestinians had broken seven years of official silence to conduct
``unprecedented'' discussions on emotional issues like Jerusalem.
He said that the parties had made significant progress on every
core dispute, and U.S. officials said that they expect the peace
process to continue after a period of ``reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak made it clear that he believed the present ``chapter''
of peacemaking had reached an end. Addressing reporters at the
Hampton Inn in Frederick, Md., Barak spoke as if he had already
moved on. ``If we have to go to a confrontation,'' he said, ``we
will be able to look straight into the eyes of our children and say
we did everything, everything in order to prevent a
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Having reportedly offered concessions on every issue, Barak, who
has staked his political career on the single goal of peacemaking,
does not apparently see a clear path ahead. He called the summit
meeting a ``significant milestone and, at this point, the last one,
in intensive and deep negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   All understandings reached at Camp David, he said conclusively,
were moot, vanished into the mist that clouded the talks during two
weeks of intermittent rain and a steady news blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's somber assessment did not square at all with the
uncharacteristically upbeat one offered by a senior Palestinian
negotiator Tuesday afternoon. Speaking in Pentagon City, Saeb
Erekat said emphatically that Camp David had paved the way for a
peace agreement by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of an agreement is much stronger than ever
before,'' Erekat said. ``What happened at Camp David are seeds that
will grow very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a perplexing optimism after two weeks in intensive,
round-the-clock negotiations during which the U.S. president pushed
aside nearly all other business, the Israeli and the Palestinian
leaders explored every issue and, particularly in regard to
determining the sovereignty of Jerusalem, hit a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Why would lower-level negotiations be able to progress further,
or, if the leaders reassembled, why would the picture change?
</P>
<P>
   After all, Erekat continued to insist Tuesday that all would be
well and good provided that Barak does what he has said he cannot
do _ acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of both Israel and the
future Palestine. Is Jerusalem an inexorably intractable issue, or
is there some give on either side that somehow was not discovered
in the seclusion of the Catoctin Mountains but will emerge later?
</P>
<P>
   Arafat will return home to a hero's welcome, not just in the
West Bank and Gaza but in the Arab world, whose capitals he will
tour immediately.
</P>
<P>
   His popularity at home, lower than ever before he departed, will
be boosted by the perception that he faced down Israel and a
superpower without conceding any of what Palestinians consider
their sacred principles, especially the sovereignty of East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that everyone will go out to applaud Arafat and say
to him, `Welcome home, Mr. President,''' said Hani al-Hassan, a
member of the central committee of Arafat's Fatah movement.
</P>
<P>
   It is more complex for Barak. Right before he left, he lost
three right-leaning parties from his broad coalition. Leaving
without a government and returning without an agreement, he faces a
good deal of uncertainty, and any uncertainty about his political
future clouds the prospects for peace, too.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has political options that would involve alliances
incompatible with any immediate progress at the peace tables. What
he cannot do is continue at the head of a minority government,
representing only 42 out of 120 members of Parliament. It is not
sustainable; he would not be able to accomplish anything.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Barak will bring home a one-page, trilateral
statement reaffirming the value of making peace. It is a long way
from an accord.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Camp David represents a significant juncture in the
history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But where it will
lead, beside through a thicket of diplomatic and political
complications, is impossible to predict.

 &HT;    Bush officially taps Cheney for VP.
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was in March, over dinner at the Governor's
Mansion, that Gov. George W. Bush first asked the man who had
served as his father's defense secretary if he would consider
taking another job in government: vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   Richard B. Cheney said no.
</P>
<P>
   But over the next four months, Bush said he grew to realize that
the man he had chosen to help Bush look for a running mate himself
possessed the characteristics that Bush sought for his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the Bush-Cheney courtship emerged during
Tuesday's national debut of Bush's much-anticipated and, to some,
surprising decision to choose a stalwart from his father's
administration, a former White House chief of staff to Gerald Ford
and a six-term congressman who has been out of public service for
nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was deeply involved in running a business, enjoying private
life and I certainly wasn't looking to return to public service,''
Cheney told a crowd of state employees, Bush campaign workers and
their friends Tuesday at his debut as Bush's running mate. ``But I
had an experience that changed my mind this spring. As I worked
alongside Gov. Bush I heard him talk about his unique vision for
our party and for our nation. I saw his sincerity. I watched him
make decisions, always firm and always fair, and, in the end, I
learned how persuasive he can be.''
</P>
<P>
   If the veteran Washington insider _ the man Bush eventually
charged with finding him a running mate _ was slow to be converted,
he moved quickly once it came upon him. Over July 4 weekend, after
talking with Bush at his Crawford ranch, Cheney changed his mind
about his willingness to consider the vice-presidential slot.
</P>
<P>
   By July 12, Cheney was in Washington getting a full physical
exam and called Bush that night from a dinner in Minneapolis to
report the results _ a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, he met with Bush and his top level campaign
advisors to discuss the implications of taking the job he was
vetting candidates for. Four days after that, he told the board of
directors at Halliburton, the Dallas energy company where he is
chief executive officer, that he was being considered for the
ticket's number two spot.
</P>
<P>
   On July 21, Cheney flew to his home state of Wyoming to change
his voter registration in order to comply with a constitutional
provision which penalizes a ticket where the president and vice
president are from the same state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not notify the campaign,'' campaign spokeswoman Karen
Hughes told reporters Tuesday. ``Gov. Bush was not aware he was
doing that. None of us at the campaign were aware in advance that
he was doing that. He felt that that was part of the process he
should go through to prepare himself to be considered to establish
his residency in his home state of Wyoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes recounted the tale of Cheney's emergence as Bush's
running mate just after the two men appeared with their wives for
the formal unveiling of the Bush-Cheney ticket at Austin's Erwin
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was quick to try to clear ho had a conservative
voting record in Congress and has the hearty approval of the
Republican party's right flank _ will help Bush fulfill his promise
to be a different kind of Republican who can reach out to Democrats
and independents, Rove cited Cheney's support for school reform
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   And he discounted questions about whether Cheney's association
with President Bush's administration will make the Bush-Cheney
ticket look more like a thing of the past to voters than the wave
of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, virtually everybody that we've talked about has some
association with the last three Republican administrations in one
way, shape or form,'' Rove said. `` Whether it's friendship with or
service in..., that's just the nature of garnering the credentials
necessary to show the American people you're up to the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said only Bush, Cheney and the team Cheney established to
find a running mate for Bush know for sure who was on the list of
candidates. Tuesday, some of those whose names were mentioned in
news reports as possible contenders, took it upon themselves to
wish the two good luck in November, including former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole and Illinois Congressman John Kasich, who
congratulated Bush on making, ``a solid choice. ``
</P>
<P>
   Ridge sent out a press release informing reporters that he
withdrew from consideration on July 6 to spend more time with his
wife and teenage children. He said that he and Bush agreed not to
make his decision to withdraw public until Bush announced his final
decision for a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said he did not believe that Ridge's support for abortion
rights was a factor. Indeed, the nitty-gritty of winning
battleground states, appeasing Republican party constituencies and
other such political calculations had little to do with Bush's
ultimate decision _ at least as Hughes and Rove recounted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became really vital to name somebody who could be seen as
president of the United States,'' Rove said. ``That was the only
political consideration if you will.''

UPSTART IRISH THEATER SETTLES INTO A SLEEK NEW HOME
</HEADLINE>
  By BRIAN LAVERY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Along one of the quieter streets in Dublin's
bustling Temple Bar, a row of traditional terra cotta brick
buildings is interrupted by a stark sky-blue facade that runs half
the length of the block. Glass and steel doors swing into a
high-ceilinged foyer with smiling receptionists. Only the rough
concrete floor, splattered with paint, hints that this could be
something more than the hip office for yet another Irish dot-com
start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the $4.5 million building belongs to Project, a
34-year-old artists' cooperative credited with leading the drive to
bring progressive visual and performance art to light in Ireland.
It also provided a training ground for future stars like Liam
Neeson, Gabriel Byrne and U2.
</P>
<P>
   The doors have only been open a few weeks, and Project is not
yet accustomed to its new building. From 1974 until construction
began in 1997, Project operated out of a dilapidated factory on
this site that was as renowned for its leaky roof as for the
controversial works it produced. When fire destroyed a two-story
corner of the building in 1984, it was simply left unattended and
christened the burnt-out space.
</P>
<P>
   But Project's offices, gallery spaces and its compact,
self-contained black-box theater _ only the second in Ireland _ are
forcing it to reconcile old bohemian ways with a polished look.
That means facing the challenge of remaining relevant in a country
where much of the ``very serious repressive stuff'' no longer
exists, in the words of the general manager, Tom Coughlan.
</P>
<P>
   If Project ever had any semblance of a strategy, it was one of
direct confrontation with the conservative elements of Irish
society. In the late 1960s, for example, Project's founders invited
Edna O'Brien, the writer, to visit Dublin and read from her work,
which had been banned in Ireland. To make a point, she opened her
suitcase to Customs officers, thus forcing them to confiscate the
books. So Project members instead recited some of her work from
memory. In 1982 a performance by a British theater company, Gay
Sweatshop, caused city officials to withdraw financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Project traces its origin to 1966, when Colm O'Briain graduated
from college, rented out the Gate Theater here for six weeks and
provided space for artists. O'Briain, now 56, went on to become the
youngest director of the government's Arts Council and to serve as
adviser to the Minister for Arts and Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Project continued as one of the only venues for
contemporary artwork or for the experimental theatrical productions
that could not be produced at the Abbey, Ireland's national
theater. Because there was no similar art space available, everyone
ended up in Project, Coughlan said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Briain described the essence of Project as a constant process
of redefinition and readjustment. The most important function is to
keep pushing progressive and experimental works, according to
Stella Coffey, executive director of the Artists Association of
Ireland, an independent trade organization. She said that
contemporary art had never been properly received in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey recalled that the country's museum of modern art did not
open until 1991, and that the government in 1977 turned down an
offer by Christo, the avant-garde artist, to create a wrapped
walkway on St. Stephen's Green, the city's sprawling central
garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talking about the cultural renaissance in Ireland,''
Coffey said, ``but it is a myth. And it is a myth that the
decision-makers believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy McArdle, 35, Project's artistic director, said she
anticipated public controversy later this summer over ``Without
Hope or Fear,'' a dance choreographed by Paul Johnson that features
nude dancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Project is now part of the establishment, by virtue of
longevity,'' said Peter O'Kennedy, 35, a sculptor and interior
designer who exhibited his work at Project in the 1980s. But
McArdle said that Project's mission was to avoid the predictable
and to uphold a tradition of supporting the arts at the far end of
the conventional spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there will be little blandness in the work shown in
the coming months as artists begin to contribute to the reinvented
Project. Next month John Frankland, a British installation artist,
will lay a wood tile floor in one of the galleries and flood it
with one foot of water, causing the floor to warp and buckle. Later
in the year Richard Greenberg's ``Three Days of Rain'' as well as
newly commissioned plays by the Irish playwrights Marina Carr and
Tom MacIntyre will be performed in Project's black-box theater.
</P>
<P>
   These works will have to win over Project's skeptics because the
cost of the work on the building surprised many people for whom
Project had been defined by its shoestring budgets. ``There's a lot
of nostalgia for the buckets under the roof and the things that
didn't work,'' said Project's visual director, Valerie Connor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to funds from the local and national government,
Project now solicits from private patrons. The annual budget of
almost $1.25 million is more than double that of any previous year.
But McArdle insists that Project still operates on a shoestring and
that it faces a steep increase in costs with the new building.
</P>
<P>
   And O'Briain said that the building might impose a culture of
compulsory success, as Project's audience becomes less forgiving of
its unpolished edges.
</P>
<P>
   But on a typically rainy Irish afternoon recently, even $4.5
million worth of glass and steel could not let Project escape its
leaky past, as water dripped in through the wall above a
second-story window.
</P>
<P>
   Connor grinned when she saw the growing puddle, as if it made
her feel more at home in the place. She said: ``I don't think it's
too precious; it's still rough.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Holyfield resumes his eclectic search for the heavyweight belts
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - This just in: Evander Holyfield is about to become the
trainer of an ex-con boxer trying to repair his life. And a
consultant to the trainer of a fighter who falls for a wealthy
woman.
</P>
<P>
   No, you didn't miss his latest retirement news. It is the
fantasy side of Holyfield's eclectic life. He has landed roles in a
pair of movies, portraying _ himself. On celluloid, as in real
life, he is who he is.
</P>
<P>
   Now, back to reality. In 17 days, Holyfield will resume his
scavenger hunt for the heavyweight division's three principal belts
when he confronts unheralded John Ruiz in Las Vegas. This one, for
the WBA crown, is the relatively easy part.
</P>
<P>
   Then, how would he wrest away the WBC and IBF titles, held by
the ever-improving Lennox Lewis? Let us count the ways.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lewis is targeted for a mandatory defense against David Tua,
the human tree stump, by November. Tua is heavyweight boxing's
flavor of the month, with his lethal punch, strong chin and
Samoan/New Zealander background. Should the champion prevail, next
spring could bring Lewis-Holyfield III.
</P>
<P>
   The squat Tua, capitalizing on a seven-inch height disparity,
could get Lewis flummoxed and slip in a knockout blow. That result
ultimately could set up Holyfield against his onetime sparring
partner.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  After disposing of Tua, Lewis could submit to public sentiment
_ and the prospects of a paycheck with endless zeroes on it _ and
meet Mike Tyson. Should Tyson triumph without committing any
felonies in the ring, the clamor for Holyfield-Tyson III would be
high-decibel. The WCW and WWF could not dream up such a dramatic
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the last scenario is the least likely. Lewis is
affiliated with HBO, Tyson with Showtime. President Clinton has
been too busy with Barak and Arafat to bring the enemy cable
networks into agreement on a bout between their bell cows. In
boxing, money talks, but it could take awhile to be heard in this
case.
</P>
<P>
   Further, because of his quick kayoes, Tyson remains caked in
ring rust. Even going on and off anti-depressants, Tyson is
cognizant enough to know he must log plenty more rounds to sharpen
himself for Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield also is a soldier for Showtime. But because the
networks have reached accord for two Lewis-Holyfield bouts already,
precedent has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The path to the belts would be clearest if Tua topples Lewis.
And to hear Jim Thomas, Holyfield's manager, it would be the most
welcome sequence. ``Evander sees some pretty significant flaws in
Tua that he believes he could easily exploit,'' Thomas said. Left
unsaid is that Lewis controlled Holyfield both times, although
judges denied him one win.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters for Holyfield is the dreaded word
``mandatory.'' Boxing bodies often give fighters little or no
choice about their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Next in the WBA line is Wladimir Klitschko, an imposing 6-foot-6
Ukrainian who dazzled recently on the Lewis-Frans Botha undercard
and could bother Holyfield. Then, the Lewis-Tua winner might be
ordered to duke it out with someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield tries not to concern himself with all of the maybes.
While eating breakfast recently at his second home, near his
training gym in Houston, the Atlantan said his attention is
occupied by restoring lost fitness after a pulled muscle pushed
back the Ruiz fight nine weeks from its original date.
</P>
<P>
   After 1 1/2 weeks of weight and aerobics work, Holyfield
returned to the sparring ring last weekend without negative
consequences. Aside from minor discomfort, he pronounced himself
healthy. ``The soreness doesn't go away as fast as before,'' says
the 37-year-old. ``That's part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The postponement raised, Pavlov-like, suspicions in the boxing
community that promoter Don King had concocted the injury to cover
up for supposedly modest ticket sales. ``They always try to blame
Don,'' Holyfield said. So he accepted King's invitation to fly to
Las Vegas and speak for himself. If Holyfield cannot be trusted,
nobody in this sport can.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like somebody was cutting me,'' he said about the
pain, which sprang from the back right side of his body from
lifting weights and wound up on the left under his rib cage. Burned
by previous instances of fighting below optimum condition, he
decided, ``You really don't need to go in there this time. It ain't
worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise decision. One more loss probably would end his quest for
the distinction of being the only four-time undisputed heavyweight
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz does not seem to pose steep problems. ``He's an aggressive
fighter, throws a lot of punches,'' Holyfield said. ``He's very
ordinary. He's not a very crafty fighter. He doesn't move his head.
He never thinks about (whether) he's going to get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, he deduced, is a one-trick pony, always aiming for the
knockout. ``I've been around long enough'' to decipher those types,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield found solace in the unplanned layoff by sharing the
first days of summer with eight of his nine children living in
Atlanta. He attended track meets involving his four oldest and
baseball games for his 10-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Other items of his calendar needed readjusting, notably the
taping of his part in a Canadian boxing film, which, according to
Thomas, might feature Kate Winslet of ``Titanic'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   For the other big-screen gig, Thomas said the lead role was
turned down because the character is a drug user with a prison
record. ``It's not a role kids should see him in,'' the manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the comparatively bit part that Holyfield accepted,
Thomas asked that profanity be minimized, which might be a tall
order if Spike Lee agrees to direct.
</P>
<P>
   After Ruiz, Holyfield hopes to toast the end of summer by taking
some of his children on an island vacation, followed by a trip to
Saskatoon to shoot his film part.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the hard part: waiting for the heavyweight situation
to sort itself out.

30-YEAR RECORD BROKEN AS CONCORDE JET CRASHES NEAR PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A New York-bound supersonic Concorde jet carrying 109
people crashed into a small hotel shortly after takeoff here
Tuesday afternoon, killing all those on board and at least four
people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first fatal accident involving the jet that travels
at twice the speed of sound, makes the trans-Atlantic journey in
just 3 1/2 hours and is the airliner of choice for those who can
afford it.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, British Airways and Air France, which created
the supersonic jet in 1969, indefinitely grounded the other
Concordes in operation. One other Concorde had been grounded in
London last week because of cracks in its wing.
</P>
<P>
   The Air France charter that crashed Tuesday was carrying a group
of German tourists bound for New York City, where they were to
embark on a two-week cruise of the Caribbean and South America. One
American, a retired Air France employee who was not identified, was
among those aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The airliner's full fuel tanks ensured a fireball on impact _
and no survivors. The fiery fuselage enveloped a small hotel in the
village of Gonesse near Charles de Gaulle airport, killing at least
four people there and injuring about a dozen others on the ground.
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, visibly shaken while touring the
scene, said the death toll is not expected to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found the cockpit voice recorder and flight data
recorder and hoped to use them for more clues to the crash. ``It
remains to be seen what condition they are in,'' a French Transport
Ministry official told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   The crash came a day after British Airways acknowledged it had
grounded one of its seven Concorde jets at Heathrow Airport in
London because cracks were detected in its wings. Air France also
found cracks in the wings of its six-plane Concorde fleet, but on
Monday assured passengers the cracks were the result of normal wear
and tear and did not make the jet any less safe.
</P>
<P>
   Many aviation experts dismissed suggestions that such cracks
could contribute to Tuesday's crash, with some saying that engine
failure was the most likely cause, after witnesses said the jet
appeared to stall just moments after its takeoff, having climbed no
more than 200 feet. Fire streaked from one of the jet's two left
engines as it screamed toward the ground.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Sid Hare, an American pilot for Federal Express who
watched the crash from his airport hotel room, told reporters the
jet appeared to be ``struggling to climb'' when suddenly its nose
went straight up, an indicator of engine failure. Hare, who saw
smoke and flames coming from one of the engines, said the plane
rolled to its left, then crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, Leonel Francsque, 25, a truck driver, was about
a half-mile away from the eventual crash site when he saw the plane
descend: ``First I heard some kind of explosion, then I saw huge
flames leaping into the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other witnesses who stood for hours on a grassy mound on
Gonesse, silently watching the rescue effort on a blackened wheat
field, Francsque described seeing the pilot apparently struggle to
keep the plane aloft.
</P>
<P>
   At one point he banked to the left, the side which was on fire,
``as if to avoid Gonesse,'' said Willy Corenthin, 29, an
electrician at the airport, who was driving from work to his
parents' apartment nearby when he witnessed the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers included 97 adults and three people under age 18,
among a group that was scheduled to board the MS Deutscheland in
New York City for a 16-day luxury cruise of Latin America.
Round-trip seats on the Paris-New York Concorde cost $9,000, about
25 percent more than normal first-class fares. Similar New
York-London service is nearly $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tour operator Peter Deilmann said the cruise, which had a total
of 510 passengers booked, would not be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Moody, a former pilot who writes regularly for British
aviation magazines, said he doubted the wing cracks had anything to
do with the crash. He described the Concordes, with an average age
is 23 years, as among the safest airliners ever made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real workhouse,'' Moody said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it has had only one mishap, in 1979, when a tire blew
out on landing. No one was seriously injured and the accident led
to a design modification that prevented any repeat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde flies at some 55,000 feet, nearly twice ordinary
passenger jets, and travels at nearly 1,350 miles per hour, twice
the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's crash, besides being a tragedy for the families of the
victims, was a crushing blow to Gallic pride. The crash comes as
the French were riding high, taking over the six-month rotating
presidency of the European Union and winning the European soccer
championship, two years after claiming the World Cup. Paris was
still basking in the glow of Sunday's conclusion along the
Champs-Elysees of the Tour de France, the world's most celebrated
bicycle race.
</P>
<P>
   The last few weeks have been what Pierre Wilmotte, a French
businessman, described as ``heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he added, ``is hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilmotte, returning from business in Britain, said he winced and
almost cried as he watched the scene of devastation from the lounge
at Waterloo Station in London, as he waited for the train to bring
him home to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a punch in the stomach,'' he said. ``After this,
how can you even talk about football?''
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board chairman James Hall Tuesday
said the NTSB, at the invitation of its French counterpart, the
Bureau Enquetes (Accident Bureau), will send a safety investigator
to serve as an NTSB observer. The NTSB was invited becuase the
Concorde provides regular scheduled service to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB conducted two preliminary investigations in recent
years involving the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   Last Aug. 24, two British Airways Concordes came within 800 feet
vertically and 0.7 miles horizontally near New York's John F.
Kennedy International Airport. One flight had departed to Heathrow
and one flight was inbound on final approach when they came too
close.
</P>
<P>
   And on Oct. 8, 1998, British Airways Flight 001 to New York was
cruising at 54,700 feet at Mach 2.0 off the coast of Newfoundland
when the flight crew noticed a ``thump felt throughout the
airframe, followed by a buzz,'' according to the NTSB preliminary
report.
</P>
<P>
   The flight continued on to New York without incident, but on
landing, airline personnel found that 40 percent of the lower
rudder was missing from the airplane.

ANALYSIS: CHENEY'S LACK OF NEGATIVES MAY HAVE BEEN HIS BIGGEST
POSITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BUSH-CHENEY) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the most momentous decision of his campaign thus far, Gov.
George W. Bush took the least adventurous and least sensational
course possible.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Dick Cheney was deeply revealing about Bush's
approach to politics and to governing. It underscored that Bush is
generally not a bold risk taker in his public life. He is so
confident that he will win the election (too confident, some
Republicans say) that he was looking more for a partner who could
help him in the White House than on the stump. He wanted someone
beside him who is utterly loyal, and with whom he is comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   And his decision suggests that Bush would be a president who,
despite his own lack of seasoning on the national stage, is not
afraid to surround himself with more experienced hands.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney brings so few overt political advantages to the ticket
that it is clear that Bush determined that whatever may win him the
White House, it would not be who he picked as his No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his decision had dribbled out over the past few
days, Bush's choice was so unexpected that as recently a week ago,
virtually every prominent Republican insider was tossing out names
like Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
former Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, and, everyone's favorite,
former Gen. Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Yet aside from his failure to win over Powell, Bush's
calculation was that a choice with more sizzle (and with more
potential liabilities) was not worth the gamble to his election _
or to his happiness in the Oval Office. Although Democrats were
gleefully digging out Cheney's conservative voting record in
Congress, Bush advisers said they were confident he would never
embarrass the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also passed up an opportunity to try to break the abortion
barrier in the Republican Party by daring to go with a supporter of
abortion rights, like Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania or Gov. George
Pataki of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's less ambitious objective was settling on a No. 2 who
passes what Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., calls the John Rocker test.
``It's like the Atlanta Braves and John Rocker,'' Kerrey said.
``You can't afford to make a selection that becomes bigger than
you. You can't afford that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's play-it-safe approach may well have stemmed from a
determination not to repeat mistakes of the past, namely his
father's selection of Dan Quayle. Again and again, his advisers
said over recent months that Bush was less insistent on bringing
added value to the ticket and more on not doing anything to hurt
it.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the first joint appearance by Bush and
Cheney, in Austin on Tuesday _ the most subdued, low energy vice
presidential roll-out in years _ and the introduction of Quayle 12
years ago could not have been sharper.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney stood placidly next to Bush, his hands clasped in front
of him. The newly burnished ticket did not even partake in the
customary overhead victory clasp. The presidential candidate, who
is derided by critics as being so unpresidential, picked a partner
whose presence practically shouts: grown-up.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from 1988 when Quayle, looking much like George
Bush's son, bounced around the stage in Huntington, Ind., appearing
so grateful to be picked that he could not contain himself.
</P>
<P>
   But while nothing went awry Tuesday, it was hardly a rousing
debut. It did not approach the energetic tableau eight years ago in
Little Rock, Ark., when Bill Clinton, Al Gore and their families
joined for one of that campaign's most memorable moments. There is
no chance that Bush and Cheney will be dubbed the ``hunks of the
heartland,'' as were Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly were candidates out there who were more
eye-popping,'' said Paul Light, an authority on the vice presidency
at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ``This would go down in
my book as arguably the safest vice presidential choice of the last
50 years. I can't think of any one that is this solid, this
noncontroversial.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans were jubilant Tuesday that Bush had found a
running mate who would not lead delegates at next week's Republican
convention to utter the dreaded ``a word'': abortion. Cheney is,
safely, an abortion foe. He is also, safely, conservative, but one
who gets on well with moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lack of interest in a political quick fix also shows that
he is mindful of history. The last vice presidential candidate who
actually made a difference in the outcome was forty years ago, when
John F. Kennedy picked Lyndon Johnson, who assured him that he
would carry Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheney pick is not devoid of political upsides _ or risks.
Cheney's vast experience in Congress, in the White House and in
national security issues will help counter critiques from the
Democrats that Bush is not ready for the White House. While Powell
was not available, it could be that Bush saw the next best thing in
Cheney, who was also a mainstay of the Persian Gulf war, his
father's Bush's greatest triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bush sought to score political points for picking a
partner for reasons that did not appear baldly political. ``I have
to admit something,'' he said. ``I didn't pick Dick Cheney because
of Wyoming's three electoral votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Safe it may seem, but not foolproof. One of Bush's prime
advantages over Vice President Al Gore is that he does not have a
long trail of congressional votes to be mined by the opposition.
But Cheney does _ and many of his votes are decidedly conservative.
For all the stature he brings, Cheney, who is close to former
President Bush, could suggest to voters that Governor Bush is a
daddy's boy.
</P>
<P>
   Also, even with his doctor's stamp of approval, Cheney's history
of three heart attacks is hardly reassuring to some people.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans seemed pleased, if not exuberant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as good as he could have done,'' said Charles Black, a
veteran Republican strategist. ``It's a risk-free choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But in politics even playing it safe has risks.

AFTER YEARS OF EFFORT, FINAL MIDEAST ACCORD ELUDES CLINTON'S
GRASP 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
 By MARC LACEY with DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was shortly after midnight, sitting across from
Yasser Arafat in the small presidential cabin at Camp David, that
President Clinton realized that the foreign policy achievement he
desired more than any other during the waning months of his tenure
had slipped from his grasp.
</P>
<P>
   On the table in the rustic cabin was an American proposal on the
future of Jerusalem, a proposal that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel was edging toward accepting.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat had repeatedly refused to give ground, and early on
Tuesday Clinton, mustering all his legendary powers of persuasion,
launched into a final pitch: If you take the deal, he told the
aging Palestinian leader, you will have achieved legitimacy and
international recognition, as well as aid and investment from the
West. If you walk away, he added, according to a senior
administration official deeply involved in the talks, ``you will
lose a Palestinian state of substantial size,'' and risk a slow
slide into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who Americans describe as ``a deeply conflicted man,''
decided to walk. He stood up, left the cabin, and at 3 a.m.,
through an aide, rejected Clinton's deal. He also refused to go
along with Clinton's Plan B: Announcing a settlement on all issues
except the status of Jerusalem, which would be kicked down the
road, with both sides agreeing to resolve it eventually, and
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, at a White House press conference, a deeply
frustrated Clinton compared the days of painstaking talks that
ended in failure to ``going to the dentist without having your gums
deadened.''
</P>
<P>
   This was hardly Clinton's first trip to the dentist's chair.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the past seven months he has invested enormous amounts
of time and prestige in an attempt to reach historic accords
between Israel and its neighbors, first the Syrians, then the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Clinton's foreign policy team was betting that
changing times plus the force of Clinton's own finely honed sense
for the middle ground might be enough to win agreement, and with it
a legacy to cap his second term.
</P>
<P>
   Yet twice so far, Clinton and his aides have been proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is hardly to be blamed for the failure of the talks that
collapsed early Tuesday morning. He entered the process with little
to lose, save for his dwindling hoard of time.
</P>
<P>
   And while his second term may be viewed as a series of lost
opportunities _ two years squandered on scandal, two years locked
in stalemate with Congress _ few presidents have devoted his kind
of time to peacemaking, from Northern Ireland to the Korean
Peninsula to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll get credit for his huge effort,'' said James MacGregor
Burns, a presidential historian at the University of Maryland. ``He
has not only talked peace but has devoted hundreds and hundreds of
hours to it. Even the collapse of this negotiation will not hurt
his standing on this score.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, not surprisingly, argued on Tuesday that the Camp David
meeting was worth the shot _ and may yet prove productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, on balance, it was very much the right thing to do,
and it increases the chance of a successful agreement, and it
increases the chances of avoiding a disaster,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   During the talks, one American official said, even a Palestinian
negotiator noted that during the two weeks of the summit, ``all the
taboos have been broken,'' as both sides discussed compromises on
Jerusalem and other areas that had never been broached outside of
policy institutes that study such issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he held out the hope that new talks could resume in
late summer or autumn, Clinton clearly sees his season drawing to a
close.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago he entered the talks privately exuding cautious
optimism. One of his closest aides said at the time that while no
deal was certain, the stars were uniquely aligned. Barak, the White
House had concluded, needed an agreement if he had any hope of
remaining in office after the recent collapse of his ruling
coalition. Arafat, they continued, knew that his own days as the
leader of the Palestinians were dwindling, and that an agreement
was his only hope for a different life for young Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   And America's prosperity and budget surpluses, Clinton's aides
concluded, meant that the president was likely to succeed in
convincing Congress to pay the huge bill necessary to support a
Middle East peace, opening the floodgates for aid from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be all gone,'' one of Clinton's aides said on
Tuesday. The president's last, best hope, the aide continued, is
that Barak survives the breakup of his coalition to negotiate
another day, and that Arafat concludes that declaring a Palestinian
state on Sept. 13 was ``the path to conflict when a compromise is
within reach.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is betting on the last pitch of the last inning, and it
may be little solace to Clinton. In some ways he had been preparing
for Monday night's meeting for seven years, since the Oslo accords
and then the agreement reached at Wye Plantation, all dress
rehearsals for the big show that never came off at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks he had worked late into the night, coming up
with ``bridging proposals,'' which were the basis for the final
proposal Arafat rejected. ``Give me a test on some piece of land
anywhere in Jerusalem or Israel, I know the answer,'' Clinton had
said the eve of the talks, discussing his late-night preparations.
``Ask me to draw a map of the West Bank in my sleep, I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   His frustration seemed particularly high on Tuesday because in
the hours after he returned from Japan on Sunday afternoon, it
seemed as if real progress was being made.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of his return, he called a meeting on security
issues, and ``there was real progress,'' one senior American
official said. Then there were sessions on borders and refugees,
and ``for the first time, we could see the outline of an
agreement,'' the official said. ``But neither side wanted to make
final decisions until they tackled Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton turned to that subject, he put together what one
official called ``a mosaic of ideas, our ideas and others' ideas,
that we felt could be the basis of a final settlement.'' That was
the proposal put to Arafat, with Clinton making the case that a
generation of Palestinians ``are on the verge of living a different
life than you lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, though, could not break free of several generations of
Palestinian ideology about the sanctity of sovereignty over
Jerusalem. Nor would he allow the issue of Jerusalem to be
deferred. His refusal to do so ``surprised'' Clinton in the words
of one aide, and ``frustrated him'' in the words of another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted it badly for the right reasons,'' an administration
official said of Clinton. ``He's invested seven years in this.''

WITH TALKS FAILED, SOME SEE MIDEAST CONFLICT AS INEVITABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The walls of the Old City glimmered in the distance
Tuesday night, warmly embracing Islam's golden Dome of the Rock,
Christianity's towering church spires and Judaism's Western Wall
with its massive Herodian stones.
</P>
<P>
   This is the view from the Promenade, where just about every
night Palestinian and Israeli families from east and west Jerusalem
gather in separate clusters for the view and the cool breeze that
breaks the day's heat.
</P>
<P>
   Here, both sides showed little surprise that the talks in Camp
David had failed, and both expressed a sense of fatalism that
conflict was inevitable over the emotional and spiritual attachment
both have to the shimmering city below _ Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence will break out. It is only a question of how and to
what extent,'' said lawyer Jeff Ostrov, 27, a religious Jew who
emigrated with his family from Newton, Mass. 17 years ago. ``There
is very little room to negotiate when it comes to Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 50 yards away on the walkway _ past stroller-pushing
mothers in Muslim veils or in Orthodox Jewish clothing _ an
extended Palestinian family sat along a stone wall.
</P>
<P>
   Cabbie Amed Ziad, also 27, said Yasser Arafat correctly refused
to compromise on Palestinian control of Jerusalem: ``The trust in
him rises now. We will not give up on our Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the violent Palestinian uprising that began in
1987, Ziad added, ``The Palestinian people learned a lot from the
intifadah. People know what to do here to get their rights. They
know this is the language that Israel listens to.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than two weeks of talks in Camp David, Jerusalem had
waited as if it were expecting a baby. But during that time, a new
sense arose of what is possible, a discussion of ideas on how to
share control of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But with the summit's collapse, lower-level Palestinian and
Israeli negotiators are expected to try to pick up the pieces and
prepare for a US delegation visit within weeks. Both sides said
they would continue to resolve the final issues of the peace
process before Sept. 13, when Arafat has vowed to declare
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Camp David, both sides were bracing themselves for
the possibility of failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army moved tanks into the West Bank. In Gaza, Jewish
settlers stacked sandbags and built other fortifications. Tuesday
night, in outlying Palestinian villages such as Abu Dis and
Bethany, a reinforced Israeli military had set up checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian police, which looks more like an army with its
fatigues and its machine guns, also beefed up its presence in its
parts of the West Bank. There were reports that Palestinians
stockpiled food and water, anticipating conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who campaigned last year on a
promise not to divide Jerusalem, returns to a government that
virtually collapsed just before he left. To survive, Barak may have
to ask the opposition Likud Party to join his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Rabinowitz, 31, who is traditioinally a more
conservative Likud voter but supported Barak last year, said, ``I
think he won the election by promising not to divide Jerusalem.
Then he marched off to Camp David and started offering to divide
it. He acts like he's still in the army and he's chief of staff.
He's lost his credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat faces different constraints. He must contain violence
from breaking out on streets that has grown restive after seven
years of the incremental peace process. And he will have to shore
up political support in the Arab world that will allow him to
continue with negotations with a more unified front.
</P>
<P>
   Ghassan Khatib, director of the Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center, said, ``The Palestinian street will wait
until the 13th of September because that is the date they care
about. They want a state, and they know that Arafat was dragged to
this summit. They'll wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the extremists on both sides have already begun their
drumbeat on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the Islamic
militant group Hamas, said in an interview at his home in Gaza,
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure of Camp David was expected. No concessions can be
made on Jerusalem and the Israelis do not want peace. I am calling
upon the Palestinian people to go back to use the language of
power, weapons, resistance and Jihad to regain their occupied land
as Hezbollah did in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Also applauding failure was Yehuda Etzion, a Jewish religious
extremist who espouses a reubilding of the Jewish Temple and was
convicted in 1984 of trying to blow up the Muslim Dome of the Rock,
built 1300 years ago atop the Second Temple's remains.
</P>
<P>
   Etzion was holding a small rally among several groups who
believe rebuilding the Temple is the only way to achieve redemption
for the Jewish people. They gathered on the Mount of Olives
overlooking what Jews call the Temple Mount and what Muslims refer
to as Haram al-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   It is a 35-acre compound that sits atop the Western Wall and the
rest of what archelogists believe is the site of the remains of the
First and Second Jewish Temple. And it is the holy ground of the
Dome of the Rock, where Muslims believe the Prophet Mohammed
ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Just after the news of the failure at Camp David, Etzion said,
``I thank God, and now we have to prepare for a war here. I don't
often compliment our prime minister. But in this case God saved us
from a very bad and black day had we given the Temple Mount to the
Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Meron Benvenisti, a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, was less
bleak in his assessment of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in neither redemption nor apocalypse,'' he said. ``I
just believe the two sides are not ready for a final settlement.
This may mean we have some violence, but it also means the two
sides just have to work harder. And I hope that is what they do,
and not just become further entrenched in their own positions.''

U.S. AND AFRICA WILL TEAM TO FIGHT GLOBAL CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By   HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ American law enforcement officials
have agreed to set up a regional academy in Botswana to help train
police officers and prosecutors from crime-ridden South Africa and
many neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which will be 160 miles north of here, just outside
the Botswana capital, Gaborone, will be the third such academy set
up by the State Department in its effort to bolster the fight
against burgeoning global crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of the Bureau of International Narcotics and
Law Enforcement Affairs, the academy, like ones in Hungary and
Thailand, will bring experts from the FBI and other federal and
international agencies to countries where the criminal justice
system lags far behind the cunning and creativity of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Since South Africa opened its borders several years ago as the
apartheid era was coming to a close, it has become a hub of
criminal activity, from counterfeiting and money laundering to drug
trafficking and alien smuggling. Lured by the high life here in the
country's richest city, criminals have come from across the
continent, overwhelming a poorly trained police force that has been
hard pressed to control its own thieves and murderers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Botswana is one of the safest countries in Africa.
Unlike Budapest or Bangkok, where the other two academies are, its
capital is not a hub of crime in its region and it has seen only
hints of the complicated criminal enterprises that are thriving in
Johannesburg. It is a country of about 1.5 million people, with a
police force of about 6,500 officers. South Africa has 44 million
people and more than 100,000 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, South Africa was the original choice for the academy,
but leaders there suggested that the United States consider
neighboring countries, according to a State Department report. As
the most advanced country in the region, South Africa is often the
location of choice for offices of international organizations. It
is a privilege that its neighbors have come to envy, even resent,
and in bowing out of this opportunity, South Africa was ceding it
to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that comes to the region comes to South Africa, and
in that sense it's prudent not to follow that pattern,'' an
American official involved in the selection process said. ``We had
a very willing partner in Botswana, and they committed the funds.''
Commissioner Norman Moleboge, the head of the Botswana police
force, said that while South Africa's crime problems were enormous
compared with Botswana's, they had to be treated as a regional
concern that, if left unchecked, would eventually undermine even
the most stable of southern Africa's countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``My neighbor's problems are as good as mine,'' Moleboge said in
a telephone interview from Gaborone. ``If major crimes find their
way into neighboring countries, they will find their way into
Botswana, so we need to fight crime from a national, regional and
international point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   American and Botswana officials signed an agreement on Monday in
Gaborone to establish the academy, and training programs are
expected to begin in the next few months. Courses will cover
subjects from forensics and narcotics to organized crime and public
corruption. Eventually, the academy is to be housed in Botswana's
national police college, which is expected to be completed in about
a year.

 &HT;    Cheney pick may prompt Gore to choose Graham
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Supporters of U.S. Sen. Bob Graham say
his chances of becoming Vice President Al Gore's running mate
improved Tuesday when Texas Gov. George Bush chose Dick Cheney to
join the Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's Democratic supporters are looking for any hopeful sign
because they are convinced that Florida's senior senator can push
Gore over the top in the Sunshine State. A victory here, they
believe, could be devastating for the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Cheney, the former defense secretary in President
George Bush's administration, fell predictably along party lines.
Florida Republicans applauded the pick while Democrats called the
choice uninspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great choice, a really solid choice,'' said Jillian
Inmon, Bush's Florida campaign director.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 1.6 million veterans living in Florida, Cheney,
who helped lead the Persian Gulf War, could be used to target those
votes, said Randy Enwright, a Republican political consultant based
in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's an excellent choice who brings a lot to the
ticket,'' Enwright said. ``There's a comfort level with Cheney that
you just don't get with a lot of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling Bush's decision ``overly cautious,'' Democratic
consultant Karl Koch said, ``Cheney doesn't deliver a single vote
in Florida. The fact is, Cheney is not a proven vote-getter
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch says the logic of picking Graham improves with Cheney on
Bush's ticket. ``This allows Gore to come into Florida and pick
someone who can help him carry an important state.''
</P>
<P>
   One theory evolving is that the Cheney pick allows Gore to
concentrate his efforts on the vital Midwest states and to use
Graham to force Bush to compete in Florida, a state Republicans
once thought they had wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls suggest that if Graham is on the ballot, Florida
would be a toss-up. Without Graham, Republicans have a stronger
edge here. With 270 electoral votes needed to capture the White
House, Florida's 25 votes are critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bush's choice helps Graham,'' said Koch

CLINTON MIDEAST PEACE GAMBLE ENDS IN FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY AND ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ The Middle East peace summit at Camp David broke
up Tuesday without an agreement, shutting down a high-stakes gamble
that for 15 days sought to end 52 years of bloody conflict between
Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton stressed that both sides had made
substantial progress in the talks on a secluded mountaintop, he
acknowledged, ``They couldn't get there _ that's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this was the first time, in an organized disciplined way,
they had to work through, both for themselves and then with each
other, how they were going to come to grips with issues that go to
the core of their identity,'' Clinton said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he hoped the talks would lead to further
negotiations before Sept. 13, the day Yasser Arafat has said he
would unilaterally declare a Palestinian state. Clinton also
expressed the hope that the summit ``increases the chances of
avoiding a disaster of violence'' in Israel and in Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
   But that was far from certain, as both Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak were to arrive home Wednesday to protests from
both Jewish and Islamist factions.
</P>
<P>
   Barak left Washington bluntly blaming Arafat for the Camp David
breakdown, saying the Palestinian leader was not ready to be a
peacemaker. But Arafat left Washington without comment, and senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat gave an optimistic assessment of
the talks, saying, ``Prospects for agreement on all permanent
status issues are stronger than at any time in almost nine years.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit-breaker was Jerusalem. The holy city was the subject
that took up almost all the time at the summit, according to US
officials, an astonishing switch from every previous
Israeli-Palestinian negotiation. All the previous talks dealt with
peripheral issues, not the core problems of Jerusalem, Palestinian
statehood, refugees and Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m. Tuesday, Arafat wrote a letter to Clinton saying that
Israel's offer on Jerusalem was not acceptable. Fifteen minutes
later, Clinton ended the talks for the night, deciding ``this knot
couldn't be untied,'' said White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't over quite yet. The three leaders agreed to sleep
on it.
</P>
<P>
   About 10:30 a.m., Clinton, Arafat and Barak gathered around a
dining room table in Aspen, the president's cabin at Camp David. It
was the 12th time that they had met, the third three-way meeting
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, they agreed there was no place to go but home.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders signed a five-part trilateral statement, written
with the help of their aides, that said the aim of their talks was
to ``put an end to decades of conflict and achieve a just and
lasting peace'' and both sides ``understand the importance of
avoiding unilateral actions that prejudge the outcome of
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot, said Lockhart, was that Clinton became convinced
that he had exhausted all the possible solutions. ``It wasn't going
to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea at Camp David was that if they could solve Jerusalem,
they could solve everything.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't. Barak offered the Palestinians partial
sovereignty over East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan
in 1967 and annexed, in exchange for broadening the geographical
boundaries of the city to include several Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not enough for Arafat, who decided he could not
negotiate away the Arab sections of the city. He would be condemned
by Islamists throughout the Arab world because the Old City, with
its Muslim and Christian quarters, is home to the sacred Muslim
sites of the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa mosques, the third
holiest site in Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Barak offered continued control over the mosque complex plus
limited sovereignty over Arab villages and neighborhoods in East
Jerusalem. In exchange, he wanted the borders of Jerusalem to be
redrawn to encompass huge Jewish settlements in the West Bank,
including Ma'ale Adumin, Givat Harel, and Pisgat Ze'ev and the
Etzion Bloc.
</P>
<P>
   But under the rules of the summit, nothing was agreed unless
everything was agreed. As Barak put it at a news conference in a
hotel ballroom basement in Frederick, Md., ``Even those ideas are
now null and void.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton said it was ``essential that they
not lose hope, that they keep working for peace.'' In a highly
unusual comment, Clinton went out of his way to praise Barak for
showing ``particular courage, vision, and an understanding of the
historic importance of this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, perhaps for domestic political reasons, blasted Arafat
only minutes after the president's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's painful to realize that the other side is not ripe for
peace, but it's always better to know the realities than to delude
ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Hebrew, he added, ``Arafat was afraid to take the necessary,
historical responsibility at this moment to bring about an end of
the conflict. The positions of Arafat on Jerusalem were those that
prevented the achievement of an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other issues as well, he said, including the fate of
Palestinian refugees. On those issues, he said, ``there are still
wide gaps of a kind of conceptual nature, not just technical
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   But Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said, ``I believe that
the continuation of our efforts will produce an agreement no later
than Sept. 13.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear, however, whether Clinton would find the time and
commitment in his last five months to help both leaders reach a
deal. In addition to planned trips to Nigeria and Vietnam, his time
will be taken by the Democratic convention in August; the
presidential campaign of Vice President Gore, the New York Senate
race of Hillary Rodham Clinton; and an ambitious legislative plate,
including a number of health initiatives such as reforms on HMOs,
prescription drugs and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House Tuesday, Clinton seemed relaxed, if tired. He
framed the conflict in religious terms, saying that the ``children
of Abraham, the descendants of Isaac and Ishmael, can only be
reconciled through courageous compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   He also described the talks as ``like going to the dentist
without having your gums deadened,'' and he compared the
negotiators at Camp David to those who forged peace deals involving
Bosnia, Kosovo and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we first started the Irish peace talks, we were
dealing with people who would hardly speak to each other. . . . We
were dealing with people who thought they were from another planet
from one another, whose wounds were open,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But as his daughter, Chelsea, sat on the sidelines of the White
House press room listening raptly, Clinton said the Israelis and
Palestinians had an extraordinary relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know each other,'' he said. ``They know the names of each
other's children. They know how many grandchildren the grandparents
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know their life stories,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, gave him hope despite failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've got to do, they've got to go home and check,'' he
said. ``They've got to feel around.''

U.N. PLANNERS HOPE TO RENEW A GRAND STRUCTURE IN DISREPAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: no byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United Nations is considering spending
nearly $1 billion on a six-year rebuilding program to address the
structural and environmental woes of its aging headquarters
buildings _ potent, but tarnished, symbols of postwar cooperation
and enlightened urbanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the business standpoint, there is no alternative,'' said
Joseph E. Connor, the U.N. under secretary general for management,
who presented an analysis of the proposal to reporters on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilding plan would cost $964 billion and require about a
third of the organization's staff members to move out of the
complex temporarily or into new quarters on the site, and it would
be likely that the General Assembly would have to meet in a
conference room for a year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is the result of a two-year study completed last
year that is to be submitted to the General Assembly when it
convenes in September. If it is approved by the 188-member General
Assembly, detailed plans will be drawn up, and the work could begin
early in 2003, Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   By far the boldest _ and, at $245 million, the most costly _ of
the plan's features is a 10-story addition to be built atop the
Secretariat Building, New York City's first curtain-walled glass
skyscraper and, along with the saddle-shaped General Assembly
Building, a widely recognized emblem of the organization. Another
addition would be built atop the Dag Hammarskjold Library, and the
South Annex would be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Because the 17-acre site is considered international territory,
none of the buildings or interiors at the U.N. headquarters have
been designated New York City landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Another, less costly option is the construction of two entirely
new buildings _ a six-story structure on an empty expanse of the
North Lawn, below East 48th Street, and a four-story building off
site. A third option is to lease commercial office space in the
neighborhood, which is less costly but fails to address future
space needs significantly, Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed plan also includes an expansion of the
organization's meeting rooms and Conference Building, and the
refurbishing of the General Assembly auditorium, public lobbies and
visitors' area, at a cost of $74 million. The chambers of the
Security Council, Trusteeship Council, and Economic and Social
Council, which are among the more architecturally distinguished
interiors in the complex, will remain more or less untouched,
Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N., still elegant and imposing when viewed from First
Avenue or across the East River, have suffered years of
budget-based neglect, and ad hoc maintenance cannot keep pace with
the breakdowns. Corroded pipes leak, railing supports are rusted
out, roofs are soaked and spongy. Motors and water pumps are so
antiquated that replacement parts are unavailable, and the
air-conditioning system has long been a source of consternation.
</P>
<P>
   The Secretariat Building _ a shimmering, 572-foot transparent
glass slab, built on a north-south axis, with 5,400 windows that
actually open and close _ stands as a modern monument to wasteful
energy consumption, and the buildings do not comply with New York
City fire codes, handicapped accessibility standards or
environmental safety codes.
</P>
<P>
   Connor displayed charts showing that if a rebuilding plan was
not approved, the current ad hoc approach to maintenance would cost
the United Nations almost $1.2 billion over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unless off-site space is leased, the refurbishment would be the
first substantial new construction on the site since the completion
of the Hammarskjold Library in 1961. Most of the
2.7-million-square-foot complex, which was designed by an
international team of architects that included Le Corbusier, Oscar
Niemeyer and Wallace K. Harrison, was built between 1949 and 1952.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations will have to rely largely on member states to
pay for the overhaul. The preferred form of payment would be a
special assessment, levied over six to eight years and paid
directly in cash, Connor said. Consideration will also be given to
spreading the cost over 25 years, either through interest-free
loans from member states or commercial borrowing through a bond
issue based on the credit ratings of the individual sovereign
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big proposal with a lot of uncertainties,'' Connor
said.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of major contributors like the United States,
which according to the United Nations already owes more than $1
billion in back dues, will be essential to the plan's success.

NEWS OF CRASH A `BOMBSHELL' TO LUXURY TOUR OPERATOR IN GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
 (With AIRFRANCE-CRASH) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The shocked and shaken owner of a German luxury tour
operator appeared on national television Tuesday to confirm that
his company had chartered the Concorde that crashed near Paris,
killing 109 people on board and at least four more on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who died had paid thousands of dollars to be
whisked to New York and a waiting cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Deilmann, of Peter Deilmann Reederei GmbH, also expressed
the dismay of a nation about to embark on its own sacrosanct August
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news was relayed by telephone to me by Air France and it
came as a bombshell,'' Deilmann said. ``We are in a state of deep
shock. I can tell you that 99 passengers booked their passage on
the aircraft through my company.''
</P>
<P>
   Deilmann, whose company is based in the Baltic port of Neustadt,
about 50 miles northeast of Hamburg, said the passengers came from
many regions of Germany. The Foreign Ministry said the single
largest group of passengers _ 39 _ was from Germany's biggest
state, North Rhine-Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry declined to identify the 96 German victims before
families were notified. Most of the passengers traveled from
Frankfurt to Paris before boarding the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said there were 100 passengers on board _ a figure
that apparently included the 99 passengers mentioned by Deilmann
and the lone American on board. Christopher Korenke, an Air France
vice president, told reporters at Kennedy International Airport in
New York that the American was a retired Air France employee.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the passengers were children, the ministry said. The
cruise was to have gone through the Caribbean to a final
destination of Manta in Ecuador, with an option to sail on as far
as Sydney, Australia, and the Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Germans are enthusiastic travelers, swarming across the globe in
search of warmer climes. The passengers on the Concorde had paid
between $4,200 and $11,000 for a cruise that was to begin in New
York on a luxury liner, the Deutschland.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was built two years ago in a mock Roaring '20s style,
with crystal chandeliers, a ballroom, a palm-filled winter garden
and a salt-water swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany expressed his
condolences to the victims' families and canceled plans to see a
performance of Goethe's ``Faust'' at the Expo 2000 world fair in
Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   The German cabinet, headed by Schroeder, said it would attend an
ecumenical service for victims of the crash Wednesday at a chapel
on the Expo grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Germany immediately indicated it intended to play a central role
in the investigation of the crash, dispatching its transport
minister, Reinhard Klimmt, to Paris and announcing that the federal
agency would begin an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The news punctured a generally upbeat mood in Germany, as a
strong economy and the passage through parliament of the largest
tax cuts for many years have bolstered the national mood and
increased Schroeder's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Deilmann said this was the fourth time that his company had
offered a Concorde-cruise package _ and it would be the last. But
the cruise, which had 510 passengers booked, would not be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense letting the ship lie there,'' he said. ``Life
goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, some passengers felt differently.
</P>
<P>
   Gitta Schoeneberg, 47, and her 48-year-old husband, Willi, were
among the hundreds of passengers who had boarded the Deutschland in
Germany and sailed into New York on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a sad voyage for us,'' Mrs. Schoeneberg said.
``Whenever we look over at an empty seat, we will think of this
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband said, ``It's better to end the cruise here.''
</P>
<P>
   He said this was the most luxurious of the 25 cruises that he
and his wife _ both teachers _ had taken since 1990. ``I would ask
the captain not to go on. We're not in the mood for a party.''

provided by ``video diaries'' kept by the subjects. In Los Angeles,
six ``loggers'' entered the characters' conflicts and dialogue into

BEFORE TUESDAY, BAD LUCK BUT NO CRASHES FOR CONCORDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Va.)  (With AIRFRANCE-CRASH) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN and MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bad luck has plagued the Concorde, the world's only supersonic
passenger jet, from the day it began development as British-French
joint venture in 1962. But until Tuesday there was one area where
its record, by modern aviation standards, was pristine: safety.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal crash of Air France Flight 4590, a charter from Paris
to New York, was the first of a Concorde after more than 30 years
of flying, an unusually long stretch for any type of commercial
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Since Air France and British Airways began scheduled service
between Paris and London and New York in the late 1970s, the
distinct needle-nosed Concorde with its swept-back delta wing has
carried more than 4 million passengers. Its manifest regularly
contains celebrity names from the worlds of business,
entertainment, sports and fashion, who pay as much as $11,000 for a
round-trip ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But the Concorde, hailed as the plane of the future in the
1960s, has become a high-tech orphan. Only 20 were built because
airlines refused to buy them. By today's standards, the Concorde is
too noisy and its engine exhaust is too dirty, which is why it is
barred from flying regularly to all but a handful of airports.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of squeezing into a Concorde seat, which offers
less room than business class on slower jets like the Boeing 777,
in addition to rubbing elbows with the elite, is the ability to
cruise at 1,350 mph 11 miles above the earth, twice as fast and
twice as high as typical subsonic jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers never feel the weariness of time-zone changes known
as jet lag, boasts Air France, because the trans-Atlantic trip
takes only 3{ hours.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years the Concordes in commercial service _ all
built in the 1970s or early 1980s _ had begun to show their age. On
Monday, the two airlines reported that microscopic cracks had been
discovered on the wings of several planes. British Airways took one
out of service but Air France said the cracks posed no threat to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Tuesday's crash, British Airways suspended
Concorde flights for the day. Air France canceled flights until
further notice.
</P>
<P>
   It is still far too early to conclude why Flight 4590 went down.
There are numerous possibilities, and many may be completely
unrelated to the Concorde's age or its unique design. Indeed, by
the standard of many commercial airplanes, the Concorde is
considered young because each flies less than 1,000 hours annually.
By contrast, there are more than 1,200 Boeing 747s, and they
typically fly thousands of hours a year.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft that crashed Tuesday had only flown 11,989 hours
since it entered service in 1980, according to Air France. The
airline said the jet went through it most recent heavy maintenance
overhaul on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   One difference between the Concorde and other aging planes,
though, is that in models produced by the hundreds over a period of
years, the oldest planes are like sentinels, giving early warning
of problems with the younger ones. But with so few planes built the
Concorde has had no such guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all built around same period of time, and whatever
happens to one is probably going to happen to all of them, about
the same time,'' said James G. Ladesic, a professor of aerospace
engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona
Beach, Fla. ``It's a little scary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supersonic flight at high altitude also places different
stresses on the Concorde than those experienced by subsonic
aircraft. For example, the rush of passing air on supersonic planes
heats the skin above the boiling point, which can weaken the
airplane's construction.
</P>
<P>
   That may be what happened to a section of the lower rudder on a
British Airways Concorde bound for New York from London that fell
off during a transatlantic flight on Oct. 9, 1998. That plane
landed safely in New York. It is one of several occasions on which
tail pieces have fallen off. In May 1998, a British Airways
Concorde lost a section of an elevon, a device on the tail used to
make the nose point up or down.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Concorde, like other supersonic planes, has a
history of wheel and tire problems, and these can lead to fires.
The Concorde's V-shape optimizes it for flying fast enough to break
the sound barrier but it also requires the planes to fly about 50
percent faster on landing and takeoff than is typical for subsonic
passenger jets.
</P>
<P>
   That heats up the tires. After takeoff, when they are retracted
into the wheel well, which is crammed with hydraulic lines, the
fluid could be in danger of igniting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wheel wells on supersonic airplanes are a pretty tight
fit,'' said Charles N. Eastlake, a professor of aerospace
engineering at Embry-Riddle, who worked for the Air Force for 13
years on the design of the B-1, the F-14 and the F-15 supersonic
jets. ``If you've got a blown tire, and you retract the landing
gear, the shredded parts of blown tire are more certain to hit
something inside the wheel well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That did not appear to be the case in the Air France crash,
since photos of the foundering plane showed the landing gear was
still down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, after Concordes blew out their tires on four occasions
over 20 months at Dulles and Kennedy International Airports, the
American safety agency, the National Transportation Safety Board,
warned Air France that pilots should not retract landing gear with
blown tires, a practice it said could have ``potentially
catastrophic'' results. The French later advised the safety board
that they had changed procedures, and the recommendation is
recorded by the board as ``closed, no longer applicable.''

</P>
<P>
   American aviation experts said Tuesday that the pictures of the
plume of fire behind Flight 4590 might have indicated the
Concorde's use of an afterburner, a feature common on
high-performance fighter jets but unique to a passenger jet. These
devices squirt fuel into the engine exhaust to create quick extra
thrust. If an engine had a mechanical failure, according to one
expert, and the operator continued to operate it, it would provide
far more fuel to burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's some massive failure in the engine and everything
has turned to mechanical confusion, then the total amount of fuel
there is dramatically bigger,'' said Eastlake, of Embry-Riddle.
</P>
<P>
   But Ladesic pointed out that even if an engine was on fire, it
was not necessarily the cause of the crash. ``There may be other
systems that were affected, such as control systems, or flaps,'' he
said. ``If one is sitting around speculating, any of those could
have caused them to lose their ability to climb.''
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde was conceived at a time when people believed there
would be Pan Am shuttles to the moon by the year 2001. The British
and French reluctantly joined forces to build the supersonic
transport because they feared that the Americans and Russian would
build them, leaving Europe behind.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Americans gave up when Congress cut the
financing in 1971. The Soviet Tupolev 144, which was based on the
design of the Concorde after Soviet agents stole the plans, crashed
famously at the Paris Air Show in 1973, ending that program.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1970s, the Concorde stood alone. The British and
the French needed to sell 300 to recoup their $3 billion
investment. Sixteen airlines had placed orders for 74 of the jets,
which was a promising start. Then oil prices shot up in 1973. The
orders dried up.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde was eventually given to British Airways and Air
France, both then state-owned, but they had trouble finding
destinations because of protests about noise. Scheduled service to
New York finally began in 1977 after the U.S. Supreme Court struck
down a decision by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to
ban the jets from landing at Kennedy Airport. British Airways now
also offers regular flights between London and Barbados in the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy about the Concorde has faded in recent years and it
has became a profitable niche for both airlines and the flagship of
their fleets. Though maintenance costs for the jets are four times
as high as what it costs to maintain a subsonic jet, each airline
still makes a profit on the Concorde. Most of the money is made on
the scheduled trans-Atlantic service with about 10 percent of sales
coming from charters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both British Airways and Air France wouldn't fly this plane
for two seconds if it was losing money,'' said Donald L. Pevsner,
an aviation attorney and part-time tour operator who has chartered
the Concorde several times.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to charter it again in June to fly over the Ascension
Islands to view a total eclipse of the sun. ``I've flown it several
hundred times,'' he said. ``I love it.''

GORE CAMPAIGN NOT WORRIED BY BUSH'S SELECTION OF CHENEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The intense speculation that had surrounded Gov.
George W. Bush as he selected a running mate swung Tuesday to Vice
President Al Gore amid signs that the Gore camp was relieved and
even joyful at Bush's choice of Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers for the vice president said the selection of Cheney, a
59-year-old oil executive and former defense secretary, gave Gore a
freer hand in picking a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats could hardly believe their luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our side, there was maybe 70 percent relief and 30 percent
glee,'' said James Carville, a Democratic strategist and longtime
adviser to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign quickly mobilized to paint Cheney as far
outside the mainstream, citing his votes against abortion and
against the South African government's release of Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   And speculation here was that the Cheney selection elevated
certain possibilities for Gore, like Sens. John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more people viable now,'' said a Democratic
strategist. ``It probably improves the chances of a `generational'
candidate _ youth, style, the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore met with Warren Christopher, the chairman of his search
committee, at Gore's residence in Washington on Monday night and
Tuesday morning. The vice president's every move is being examined
for its implications in the selection of a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Gore described the meeting as part of his
effort to maintain a dignified process.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters that he was down to a short list but did not
want to divulge any names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's only fair to the men and women involved to keep
it private and dignified,'' he said, ``because only one person is
going to be picked and the others will not be, and I want the ones
who are not picked to feel respected and well-treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore has managed to bump into several of his prospects
along the campaign trail. He attended a fund-raising reception
Tuesday night at the Virginia home of Kerry. On Sunday, he met with
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut at the Manhattan apartment
of singer Paul Simon. He begins a vacation on Thursday in North
Carolina on an island that is home to Edwards. Sen. Evan Bayh of
Indiana will be vacationing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore had to cancel his appearance at a dinner in Nashville
last week, he asked Sen. Bob Graham of Florida to fill in. After
Christopher met with Gore on Tuesday morning, Christopher met with
Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin would not say whether the 40-minute visit focused on his
selection or someone else's. The senator, who has met with
Christopher before, could help Gore with organized labor, farmers
and the liberal wing of his party, but at 61, he could be perceived
as part of the past and not the future.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the names, and with Bush's selection of Cheney, talk of
former Sen. George Mitchell of Maine has died down. If Bush had
picked a relative newcomer, like Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma,
Gore might have felt the need to pick an older voice of experience,
like Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters believe that Gore already has the experience that
Bush had to seek in a running mate, and some say that frees him to
pick someone with a young and vigorous image.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Gore, called Cheney a ``retro''
choice, indicating that Gore wanted someone who speaks to the
future. Chris Lehane, also a Gore spokesman, said the selection
underscored that ``this really is your father's Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush had picked a woman, or someone who could have helped the
Republicans win a critical state, Gore might have felt pressured to
pick someone with the same appeal. Some in the Gore camp were
worried that Bush would pick either Sen. John McCain of Arizona or
Gen. Colin L. Powell, who might have electrified voters in a way
that would have been difficult for Gore to counter.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, those close to the Gore campaign said, the choice of
an older white man who brings little charisma to the ticket and
whose home state of Wyoming was already in the Republican column,
means that Gore does not have to match a particular quality or
region or find a political superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Allan J. Lichtman, an specialist on presidential politics at
American University, said: ``This gives Gore an absolute free shot,
politically. It puts no pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a Democratic consultant, said that the Cheney
choice could even provide some momentum to Gore's candidacy. He
said that Cheney's past heart problems prompted a flurry of stories
about his health, thus squandering a chance for a boost.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is retreating from its earlier consideration
of trying to cut into Bush's ``bounce'' from the Republican
convention by announcing the Democratic running mate shortly after
the Republicans leave Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, one possibility was to set a date the following week in
which Gore would announce his choice, a process that advisers said
would bring more dignity to the selection.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the Democratic
nominee in 1988, said in an interview that the choice of Cheney
``should not make one particle of difference'' for Gore. Whatever
Bush's choice, Dukakis said, Gore is still under obligation to pick
someone who could step into the job of president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't really have a free hand,'' Dukakis said. ``You
still fundamentally have to pick someone who really shines as a
potential president.''

<P>
   ATLANTA - Georgia's eight congressional Republicans met among
themselves and with national party leaders Tuesday. But after
daylong talks they couldn't settle on a candidate to take on U.S.
Senate appointee Zell Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Three members of the House GOP delegation are considered among
the best hopes for their party to regain the seat held by the late
U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell, who died last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Reps. Bob Barr of Smyrna, Saxby Chambliss of Macon and Jack
Kingston of Savannah were not ready to declare themselves
candidates the day after Democrats called Miller out of retirement
to fill the vacancy temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of a special nonpartisan election Nov. 7 will fill
out the remaining four years of Coverdell's term. The three-day
candidate qualifying period begins next Wednesday. Miller has said
he will run.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Johnny Isakson of Marietta, one of the most discussed
potential Republican challengers, said Tuesday he will not run for
the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson admitted the race was a temptation. But he said he had
to honor commitments he made when he won his 6th District seat in a
special election last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a man allows his ego to override his good judgment
and commitments to others, he is no longer a public servant,''
Isakson said. ``He is just a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's appointment reduces the Senate's Republican majority to
54-46. The popular former governor is headed to Washington as early
as this afternoon, where he will be sworn in Thursday. He is
expected to begin assembling a staff immediately and could cast his
first Senate vote by Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Republican leaders in Georgia say, they hope to
have decided on a single candidate to reclaim Coverdell's seat.
Sen. Mitch McConnell, chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee, met with the Georgia delegation
Tuesday. He acknowledged a quick resolution is needed ``because of
the absence of time'' before the special election.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans criticized state officials' decision to set
candidate qualifying for next week, Aug. 2-4, during the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Cathy Cox said the qualifying period needs to
begin as soon as possible since the election is only three months
away. And candidates don't have to be present to register.
</P>
<P>
   But state Republican Chairman Chuck Clay called it ``bully
politics at its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They absolutely want to make it as difficult as possible for
us,'' Clay said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Republicans initially have deferred to the congressional
delegation for possible candidates. Reps. Charlie Norwood of Evans
and Mac Collins of Hampton also have said they won't run.
</P>
<P>
   For those evaluating a bid, there are other uncertainties.
Chambliss, for example, met privately with the Senate leadership as
well as House Speaker Dennis Hastert, who would be concerned about
the Republicans' ability to hold onto Chambliss' House seat if he
leaves to run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the congressional delegation, Georgia Republicans
have a limited pool of candidates that could immediately mount a
statewide campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the possibilities are former Georgia Attorney General
Mike Bowers, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Atlanta
businessman Guy Millner, none of whom has publicly expressed
interest in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Mack Mattingly, the last Georgia Republican to serve in the U.S.
Senate before Coverdell, is among the few remaining potential
candidates with statewide experience.

PLAYING WHEN HE WANTS, AND REMEMBERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It's 2 a.m., the middle of the day for Van
Cliburn, who gets up when most people go to bed, and he's at the
piano in his living room, playing Chopin ballades. He starts the
Ballade in F minor, skips to the middle, then to the coda, nodding
to show how he keeps the same tempo. He does the same with the
Ballade in G minor. ``Want to hear the F major?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, if he must.
</P>
<P>
   Cliburn will perform Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto in B flat
minor with Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony at the Tanglewood
Festival in Lenox, Mass., on Friday. He gives a dozen or so
concerts a year instead of the hundred he used to give, year in,
year out, for 20 years, a schedule that finally wore him down.
</P>
<P>
   Except for gray hair and a few lines, he still looks pretty much
as he did on the cover of his famous recording of the Tchaikovsky
with Kirill Kondrashin and the RCA Symphony Orchestra, which was
the first classical LP to sell a million copies. Americans who
owned no other classical recording bought that album. That was in
1958, the year he won the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow and got
a ticker-tape parade in New York. A ticker-tape parade for a
classical musician. Think about that for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, last month America's musical golden boy turned 66.
Think about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   I might mention that he sings while he plays the ballades.
Loudly. Nicely. He has sung at church since childhood. Another
reason he says he quit giving concerts for about 10 years was to
give himself more time to go to the opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every composer the most admired instrument is the human
voice,'' he says. ``My mother would make me sight-sing before I
would play any piece to cement in me the realization that striking
the keys is not a digital or mechanical thing. The goal is to make
a singing sound, to let the sound penetrate the air like a human
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   His piano, a nine-foot Steinway covered with silver-framed
photographs, is completely out of tune. Out of tune like a
summer-camp piano during off-season. Steinway's chief technician,
Ron Coners, has offered to come and tune Cliburn's piano. But
Cliburn doesn't mind it the way it is. Most pianists obsess about
pianos. He doesn't obsess.
</P>
<P>
   That he hits a few wrong notes while he plays may be taken as a
sign of great generosity. He's not performing. This is a chat at
the keyboard, and there's no vanity on display here. There's no
vanity about Cliburn at all. He is comically modest. It's as
impossible for him to speak flatteringly about himself as it is to
hint at something even remotely critical about anyone else. He is
charming and at the same time withholding, and this combination can
make him seem vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   What's most remarkable about how he plays the ballades is the
sound. It's the old Cliburn sound, huge and sculptured, the bass
and top voices booming out to fill a concert hall, which this
living room virtually is. The room, the house, the sound, Cliburn's
hands, the picture of his mother on a placard from a concert she
gave that is in the next room, the view of the city that stretches
out below the house, the accumulated history: everything here is
Texas-scale.
</P>
<P>
   Fame, on this scale, is always a target. When his energy lagged
and his playing declined in the late 1970s, before his sabbatical,
the daggers came out. He couldn't handle the spotlight after all.
He hadn't learned enough repertory to sustain a long-term career.
He was spinning his wheels. The Tchaikovsky concerto again? An
entertainer for the masses, he was talented, sure, but where would
he have been without the Cold War and the boyish, squeaky-clean
looks and his genius impresario, Sol Hurok? With all the other good
pianists in the world, Cliburn was lucky.
</P>
<P>
   So, for the record: he was from the start a phenomenal, natural
musician, as every other pianist recognized. Prolific enough in the
standard repertory. He played or recorded Beethoven's Third, Fourth
and Fifth Piano Concertos, Rachmaninoff's Second and Third
Concertos and Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, both Brahms
concertos, both Liszt concertos, Chopin's First, MacDowell's
Second, the Schumann, the Grieg, Mozart's C major (K. 503),
Prokofiev's Third. Shall we go on?
</P>
<P>
   Standards vary. A pianist like Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli,
playing a mix of less conventional and familiar music, had a
minuscule performing repertory, but that was considered a sign of
his perfectionism. When he canceled concerts, people used words
like ``elusive'' and ``enigma.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliburn always was the opposite of a shallow showboat. When
other young American pianists of his generation were perfecting a
midcentury style of bloodless technique, he was an instinctive,
honest, ardent player of absolute control, the model of modern
musicianship. Listen to the recordings. Rock-solid beat. Minimum of
rubato. Moderate-to-slow tempos. Architectural solidity, which gets
back to his point about the ballades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much rubato is a big mistake, especially with Romantic
music,'' he says. ``It's the opposite of what people assume.
Rachmaninoff said that if you play a passage very evenly and more
slowly than you think it should be played, then it will sound fast,
and he was right. If I try to play faster than I can hear the
notes, then I'm finished. You can't let the horse ride you. That's
what my mother taught me, and it's what Friedheim taught her.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Friedheim is the key. Although Cliburn became known as a
pupil of Rosina Lhevinne, the famous Russian pianist and Juilliard
teacher, she came along late in his development. His mother, Rildia
Bee O'Bryan, a gifted player, made him what he was at the keyboard
before he arrived at the Juilliard School. She, in turn, had
studied with Friedheim, who studied with Anton Rubinstein and
Liszt, so Cliburn is, among other things, a straight descendant of
the two great figures of 19th-century pianism.
</P>
<P>
   Friedheim's legacy was to promote Liszt's Classicism. Friedheim
played in an Apollonian style: long lines, direct expression,
beautiful tone. ``Friedheim always told my mother that music has to
be nearly metronomic if the lines are to be long and the effect is
to be like a singer singing,'' Cliburn says. ``And so that's what
my mother drilled into me.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it surprising that what first impressed the Russians at the
Tchaikovsky Competition was how Cliburn played not Russian music
but Bach and Mozart? He hardly plays them in public anymore. At
Juilliard, the faculty jury for his graduation recital heard him
perform Brahms' F minor Sonata and Hindemith's Third Sonata, but
those works didn't make it into his concert repertory, either.
Neither did Schubert's B flat Sonata or D major Sonata, which
Lhevinne encouraged him to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 18 or 19, I went through a vast amount of the piano
literature,'' Cliburn says. ``But I felt if I were to have a
career, I would not be a musicologist: I had no desire to play all
the works of anyone. I decided what I could do well and stuck to
that. I'm very realistic about myself, where I have flaws, what I
really don't do well.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``I play what I feel most comfortable with, but this
doesn't mean that I am not very anxious when I perform. I am always
anxious. Rarely have I ever been happy with anything I've done on
stage.'' That's a curious thing to say, even considering how
artists typically demur.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Cliburn spoke to a group of amateur pianists taking
part in a competition here run by the Cliburn Foundation. (He has
even less to do with that contest than with the professional one
named after him, but he lends his name and talks to the players,
which turns out to be plenty.) He told the amateurs that the stage
is the loneliest place he knows, and he said pianists spend their
lives preparing music only to walk before an audience and not have
the slightest guarantee of what will happen. This may be true, but
it is not exactly a love sonnet to concert life.
</P>
<P>
   This year's amateurs heard a fable about music besting painting
among the arts because it is intangible and indestructible _ like
memory, Cliburn said. At least memories last.

CONCORDE CRASH STUNS AEROSPACE INDUSTRY GATHERED AT AIR SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARNBOROUGH, England _ The Concorde has been a popular visitor
over the years at the Farnborough International air show, and the
first-ever crash of the supersonic jet stunned the world's
aerospace industry gathered here this week.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the crash broke in midafternoon, while fighter jets were
making their daily demonstration flights over the air show.
</P>
<P>
   Some show participants had already returned to London, which is
about 50 minutes from Farnborough by train. But most were still at
the air show, and they gathered around TV sets at the media center
and in the chalets to watch news reports of the crash. Suddenly,
the business of the show did not seem so important.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation that organizers might approve a memorial
fly-by Wednesday by some of the planes that fly daily at the show.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde, flagship of British Airways, has a very special
place in the hearts of people in England, which jointly built the
plane with France. When one of the jets flies over the city in late
afternoon after a flight from Kennedy airport in New York to
Heathrow, people look up to follow the graceful plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde can still turn heads, even though it has been in
service for nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the crash was personal for many at Farnborough.
</P>
<P>
   The European Aeronautical Defense &AMP; Space Agency (EADS) and BAE
Systems are joint manufacturers of the Concorde, and both have a
large presence at Farnborough, as does Rolls-Royce, which makes the
Concorde engines.
</P>
<P>
   The EADS chalet became a crisis headquarters Tuesday night for
dealing with the crash.
</P>
<P>
   BAE Systems and EADS provide technical support for the Concorde
fleet of 13 planes. They issued a joint statement from Farnborough
that said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that a Concorde operated by Air France was involved
in an accident shortly after take-off. The special flight, AF4590,
was operating from Paris to New York for a German operator.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its prestige and technological achievement, Concorde was
a financial white elephant. The production run was halted after
only 20 airplanes. The mistakes of the Concorde program have been
recalled in stories and in discussions at the air show this week
about the next great European aeronautical venture _ the Airbus
A3XX superjumbo.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus, whose roots go back to the Concorde, says things will be
different this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde project began in 1962 when France and Great Britain
signed a historic agreement to work together for the first time to
manufacture an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus did not yet exist, but two of the companies involved in
the project, British Aircraft and Sud-Aviation, a leading aircraft
manufacturer in the south of France, later became the initial
partners in the Airbus program before companies in Spain and
Germany joined.
</P>
<P>
   The French company later became Aerospatiale, which is now part
of EADS. British Aircraft became British Aerospace, which is now
BAE Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus was formed in 1969. Earlier that year, the Anglo-French
Concorde prototype made its first flight at the Aerospatiale
airfield in Toulouse, which became the headquarters of Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   The French-built Concorde was manufactured in the same building
at the Toulouse airport where today Airbus builds its A320
single-aisle jets.
</P>
<P>
   Henri Ziegler, who had commanded the Free French Air Force in
World War II, headed the newly created Airbus consortium. It had
been Ziegler who pushed hard for the Concorde project and lobbied
U.S. airlines to buy the jet.
</P>
<P>
   They did, taking more than two dozen options on the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which was developing its own supersonic passenger plane
before the funding was canceled by Congress, was one of the early
opponents of the Concorde. When Pan American, the launch customer
for the 747, canceled its order for the Concorde, other American
carriers followed. Without American markets, Concorde's fate was
sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the battle is over the A3XX. Boeing is trying to persuade
airlines to forgo the Airbus plane for a stretch version of the
747.

Fort Worth, Texas: memories last.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You hang on to a moment here or there that's acceptable,'' he
said about recollecting his past performances, ``but I don't know
the experience of being fully satisfied. I remember being asked to
approve a live recording of the Third Rachmaninoff, which I knew
had something good about it, but I couldn't stop feeling upset by
the smudges. Recording makes me nervous. It's enough to deal with
an audience. It was 10 years before I let the tape of the
Rachmaninoff Second Sonata go.'' Which, of course, is now regarded
as one of his best recordings.
</P>
<P>
   He describes hearing William Kapell play Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody
on a Theme of Paganini at Lewisohn Stadium in New York in 1953,
just before Kapell was killed in a plane crash. Cliburn didn't see
the point even of learning the piece after that performance,
declining invitations to play it for years, until Eugene Ormandy,
his friend, who had conducted Rachmaninoff playing it, finally
coaxed him in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He did it partly to be accommodating. That has been his problem
sometimes. When people have clamored to hear him play what he is
already famous for, he has. Critics who have heard the Tchaikovsky
concerto over and over again may be bored by it, but most people
rarely hear it live and will get to hear Cliburn play it live only
once. And he has known that.
</P>
<P>
   It's nearly 4 a.m. now, and he is on the sofa, reminiscing,
which can be an uncontrollable phenomenon. Ask him why, after
winning in Moscow, he went to study with Bruno Walter and he
recalls playing the Prokofiev Third on Dimitri Mitropoulos' piano,
then describes what he calls an unremarkable conducting stint in
1963. The stories, although familiar, are to say the least
exceptional, but it's not clear by the end exactly what he learned
from Walter.
</P>
<P>
   Or what he learned from Rosina Lhevinne, which is another
question put to him: ``One of the things I distinctly remember was
being a little early for a lesson and she was playing, and I opened
the double doors to the studio and heard her play Chopin's `Aeolian
Harp' Etude _ oh my, as if from heaven!'' Yes, but about the
lessons? ``Well, I remember she wanted tempi faster sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   So Cliburn gives the impression of being utterly content now and
not too inclined to excavate the past afresh. He lets on at one
point, as if revealing a deep family secret, that he's thinking
about performing Bach again, the E minor Partita, maybe, and he
floats a program for a scheduled Chopin recital in Boston that is
so preposterously long that it sounds like a fantasy of a young
pianist in the first flush of success _ as if, no matter how
stressful the stage may have been all those years, it is still the
locus of his imagination.
</P>
<P>
   How much is enough for a career?
</P>
<P>
   Only he has the right to say, of course. His place in history is
reserved. Cliburn, who spent years living out of a suitcase in
hotels, a born performer but a private man, having made several
landmark albums, now plays when he wants, if not always at the
level he did when he was young and playing all the time. He lives
in a real house, cooks for pleasure, socializes, does nothing if he
feels like it, goes to the opera, travels constantly without
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mementos on the piano is a snapshot of Vladimir
Ashkenazy, the pianist, who once said: ``Van is what he is; he is
not pretending to be anything else. And there are not so many
people in the world, especially in the artistic world, who are just
as they are.''

</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T posted a 16 percent increase in second-quarter profit,
modestly exceeding analysts' expectations, but the company's
revenue growth continued to slow amid deepening erosion in the
consumer long-distance business. While some of the company's newer
operations, including wireless, are performing well, the shrinking

AN INNOVATIVE LONDON MAKES ART NEW, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By JOHN RUSSELL   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ If art suddenly has a new importance in London life, it
is not simply a matter of bigness, or visibility, or skillful
promotion. It is a citywide sense that not enough was being done
with resources of which more could be made.
</P>
<P>
   Within four or five weeks of its opening, and despite the fact
that the footbridge across the Thames was not yet in use, the Tate
Modern, an enormous building on the south bank of the river, face
to face with St. Paul's Cathedral, had welcomed its millionth
visitor.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear to this critic that every one of its multitudinous
spaces was filled every day with people who had gone there in
search of a major experience. It was also clear that many of them
were getting it where they least expected it.
</P>
<P>
   There was, as promised, a procession of major classics of
20th-century art. Painting and sculpture were there in
super-abundance. But there was also a daylong awed attendance in a
small dark room in which a video piece by the American artist Bill
Viola was played continuously.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors had clearly never watched any of Viola's work
before, and quite possibly never heard of Viola. It was an awesome
piece. On the left-hand side of the screen, a young woman was
giving birth in close-up, second by second. It was a real young
woman and a real birth. Her screams were real, too. We were right
there, inches away from her image.
</P>
<P>
   On the right-hand side, an elderly woman was dying in bed. She,
too, was seen in close-up, with her every struggle to breathe both
visible and audible. Within a matter of long minutes we witnessed
the two extremes of life _ a birth and a death. All notions of
preformed art were put aside.
</P>
<P>
   But London itself also had to be redefined. After the end of
World War II, the city set about squandering its ancestral
advantages. It was blind to the dilapidated state of areas that
would have been treasured in any other capital city. It had
encouraged the growth of speculative office building that deadened
all delight among those who had to work there or live there. It
went almost unnoticed that the small industries that had meant so
much to London were vanishing, one by one, leaving structures for
which no imaginative use had been found. At the opposite extreme,
there was the colossal scale of the London docks _ mile upon mile
of them, deep, broad and decaying _ that spoke for an imperial
hegemony that had gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   After St. Katherine's Dock was closed in 1968, more than a
million square feet of solidly built storage space lay empty. A
handful of gifted artists got permission to have studios there.
(Among them was Bridget Riley, whose work will be seen in New York
this season at both Pace Wildenstein and the Dia Center for the
Arts.)
</P>
<P>
   This was the beginning of a new and imaginative idea of what
could be done with a London that was sadly run down. In no time at
all, artists took over spaces that had never been used as studios
before. They were were soon at home in neighborhoods in east
London. Dealers followed (Angela Flowers among the first of them).
</P>
<P>
   It is in large part because of these migrations that visitors
can now eat as well on Clerkenwell Green, where none of them would
once have ventured, as in the four-star restaurants in the West
End.
</P>
<P>
   What once looked like almost derelict East End streets have
turned out to harbor stately gallery spaces. Areas once famous for
criminality and sweatshops look, on a fine summer morning, like
country villages in which every window sparkles and every
cobblestone seems to have just been hand-cleaned with a toothbrush.
</P>
<P>
   Hoxton Square was built on land on which, in the 1680s, Ben
Jonson killed a fellow actor in a duel. Now it has both a circus
school and a fitness center. An Aston Martin or a Mercedes arouses
no notice at lunchtime, though the area is said to be markedly less
sedate after nightfall. New paintings can be seen, in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   All over London, the words ``make it new'' have lately been
applied to museums. Through Sept. 17, the National Gallery is
presenting an innovative exhibition, scattered throughout its
galleries, in which 24 living artists were invited to choose a
painting from the gallery's collection and take off from it in
whatever way they liked. These are not ``copies'' or ``versions,''
but fancies brought to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   It was a daring notion, fraught with possibilities of
catastrophe. But the choice of artists was daring, too, with
Balthus, Anselm Kiefer, Sir Howard Hodgkin, R.B. Kitaj, Louise
Bourgeois, Jasper Johns and Richard Hamilton among them. I was
touched and delighted by Frank Auerbach's adaptation of a motif
from Constable's ``Hay Wain,'' by Hodgkin's majestic reinvention of
Seurat's ``Bathers at Asnieres'' and by Viola's video variant of
Bosch's ``Christ Mocked.'' Every micromovement in the Viola had
something valuable to say about human nature.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of pure pleasure, the renovated Wallace Collection in
Manchester Square has had few rivals this summer. It was always a
voluptuous museum, with French 18th-century furniture and objects
of art allied with a wonderful group of paintings by Watteau and,
among much else, the Poussin ``Dance to the Music of Time'' that
runs in and out of of Anthony Powell's great 12-novel sequence.
</P>
<P>
   But so much perfection calls for perfection of upkeep, and under
its present director, Rosalind Saville, a $16 million overhaul has
brought every object to a state approaching perfection. It is one
of the more freakish facts of art history that Vincent van Gogh was
much taken with a visit to this collection when he first came to
London. His favorites were not ours, but they made a deep
impression upon him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the question had arisen as to what should be done
with Tate Britain, as the original Tate Gallery on Millbank is now
named. Much of its collection is now on view at the Tate Modern on
Bankside.
</P>
<P>
   What to do on Millbank? It was decided among other things to
make it clear that all six centuries of British art were in the
Tate's collections. It was further decided to present British
painting in a way that owed nothing to chronology. British art of
all sorts, sizes and dates would be there. There would be captions,
but basically it was for the visitors to keep from being confused.
</P>
<P>
   This was a combative notion, and it led off with a combative
wall text by the French critic and philosopher Roland Barthes.
``Beef is good for you'' was the essence of what Barthes had to
say. Though of doubtful relevance to the show _ notwithstanding the
mighty presence of Endymion Porter, as painted by William Dobson,
court painter to King Charles I _ Barthes' remarks could doubtless
be interpreted as a salute to Britain's traditional habits at
table.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a 16th-century ``Allegory of Man,'' the Tate
raced through the centuries, with everyone from Sir Joshua Reynolds
to Zoffany's ``Cock Fight,'' Holman Hunt's ``Awakening
Conscience,'' a well-deserved homage to David Bomberg's part in the
modern movement in Britain, and Kitaj's masterly summation of life
in Cecil Court, off Charing Cross Road, at the time of the
Diaspora. The show is not always lucidly argued, but the message of
this inaugural exhibition is, ``Keep going! British art has more to
show!''
</P>
<P>
   A last word: It had long been a disgrace to London that the
Holocaust had no permanent exhibition. This was righted when the
Queen opened and toured, not long ago, ``The Holocaust,'' at the
Imperial War Museum on Lambeth Road. It is a concise, imaginative
and unsparing account not only of what happened during the
Holocaust but also of what was thought, or not thought about it,
among the Allies. The exhibition should not be missed.

SHEEP FARMERS WIN ROUND ONE IN BATTLE WITH GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  By CAREY GOLDBERG 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST WARREN, Vt. _ Thirteen-year-old Jackie Faillace turned off
the electricity to the low wire fence, stepped over, and began
pointing out some of her favorites, as they turned their golden
eyes toward her and asked, ``Maaa?''
</P>
<P>
   There was Mrs. Friendly, who likes to be petted, and Buttercup,
her baby from last year. There was Pumpkin and Sweetpea and Olga.
And back home somewhere was Moe, a 2-year-old lamb that Jackie used
to bottle feed, and who is so beloved that his admirers made up a
special protest sign for him: ``Hell, no, don't kill Moe!''
</P>
<P>
   The protest came after U.S. Department of Agriculture announced
last week that, because of a potential threat to public health, it
planned to kill all of the Faillaces' sheep and compensate the
family. The announcement came after tests on four sheep from a
related flock showed signs of some kind of transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy, the family of fatal disorders that includes mad cow
disease. Further tests lasting two years or more would be required
to determine exactly which disease it was.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the department plans to seize and destroy nearly 400
imported Belgian sheep from three Vermont flocks, over the
objections of Larry and Linda Faillace, who own 120 of them, and
another owner. The owners are challenging the validity of the test
results and asking for independent confirmation, saying the sheep
have been carefully monitored and were never exposed to feed that
could cause mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter had been expected to begin last Friday, but
instead, the Faillaces and the other objecting owner, Houghton
Freeman, went before a judge to have it stopped, and were promised
a day in court before any killing could begin.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing in Burlington, Judge J. Garvan Murtha, the U.S.
District Court chief, asked the owners to bring in two experts to
testify on Thursday about the science of the test results and asked
federal officials to invite their own test expert.
</P>
<P>
   The Faillaces declared themselves more than satisfied. ``I hope
no other sheep farmer ever has to go through this,'' Linda Faillace
said.
</P>
<P>
   And the government stood by its scientific guns, saying it was
confident its decision would be upheld. The Department of
Agriculture vowed in a statement to ``continue our efforts to
protect American agriculture, and ultimately, the health of the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the sheep is uncertain; government lawyers pointed
out that the law leans heavily on the side of giving agencies broad
discretion to take action in an emergency, and any possibility that
mad cow disease, which has killed dozens of people in England, had
entered the United States would be an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is clear: Rarely does a dispute pit the federal
government against people who seem to so embody the pastoral spirit
of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The Faillace (pronounced Fal-LAYSE) family took up dairy sheep
farming deliberately and rationally; Larry Faillace has a doctorate
in animal science, and the family chose dairy sheep farming because
they saw that America was importing millions of dollars worth of
sheep dairy products each year. They chose the East Friesian breed
from Belgium because it gives about 10 times as much milk as their
American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   On their rented farm in this mountainous countryside near the
Sugarbush ski area, the three Faillace children do the work that
inspired the family to name their cheese brand ``Three Shepherds.''
Francis, 16, handles the pasture management; Heather, 14, does the
milking; and Jackie makes the cheese _ and fine cheese it is,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New American Cheese,'' a glossy book published this year
by Stewart, Tabori and Chang, described it as ``stunning,'' and it
was recently featured on a Martha Stewart program.
</P>
<P>
   The family also runs a small grocery store in a 19th-century
schoolhouse building that has lately turned into the hub of
pro-Faillace activity. Signs outside beg ``Save Our Sheep!'' and
one day last week, Francis Faillace could be seen putting the
finishing touches on one that read, ``Don't Let Politics Kill the
Sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Faillace said the family has a phone tree of more than
100 people who are ready to come to the farm within minutes of
hearing that federal agents have arrived to take or slaughter the
sheep.
</P>
<P>
   They include, she said, ``older ladies who say they'll bring
their shotguns,'' as well as some people who have suggested
bringing their cars to block off the roads leading to the farm, and
others who want to handcuff themselves to the sheep. The Faillaces
are discouraging violence, but say they are encouraging people to
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters are also keeping a 24-hour watch on the sheep, and
friends have taken the family collie for safekeeping, Jackie said,
in case federal authorities decide that all the animals on the
farm, not merely the sheep, need to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Faillaces and their supporters also have been using the
Internet to get the word out and marshal support. And they have
found an ally in Tom Pringle, a national expert on mad cow disease,
and in his www.mad-cow.org Web site, a center for information on
the topic. He questions the government's tests, including the
reputation of the Staten Island, N.Y., laboratory that performed
the most damning one.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the Faillaces' staunchest allies are just folks here
in the Mad River Valley, seeking to defend the family from what
they see as government excess.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bob Hansen, a neighbor who stopped by one morning last
week, ``This is just like trying to take Elian Gonzalez all over
again.''

CLINTON LOSES BID TO CUT MIDEAST DEAL 
 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ President Clinton gambled and lost in his bid to
cut a peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians at the
Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
   But, ever the optimist, he refused to give up hope that some
kind of settlement might be possible once both sides take time to
mull over the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 days holed up at the Camp David presidential retreat,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, along with Clinton, gave up their monumental search for a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   The talks ended after Arafat apparently refused to budge from
his position that the old walled city and most other parts of east
Jerusalem be placed under Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refused to characterize the collapse of the summit as a
U.S. foreign policy failure. Instead, he portrayed the talks as a
historical meeting that allowed the leaders to at least make some
progress on other key issues that separate them. Those issues
included the final borders of a Palestinian state, the fate of Arab
refugees in the region and Israeli settlers in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notwithstanding the failure to make an agreement they made
real headway,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House. ``In the
last two weeks significant progress was made on the core issues.``
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton had sought an all-encompassing agreement that
would leave few if any issues unresolved in the 52-year-old
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. What he got in the end was only a
pledge from Barak and Arafat to continue working without any
guarantee of future meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Ross, Clinton's special Middle East envoy, is scheduled
to visit the region in two weeks to assess whether it might be
possible to revive the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a little bit of reflection,'' said one
senior U.S. official, ``before we try again.``
</P>
<P>
   While both leaders rejected the use of violence to achieve their
goals in a trilateral statement issued with Clinton at the summit's
conclusion, there was no commitment from Arafat not to unilaterally
declare a Palestinian state, as he has threatened to do on Sept. 13
if no settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is concerned that such a declaration
could ignite another Israeli-Palestinian war.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. official who briefed reporters said Clinton had
emphasized in his final discussions with Arafat the importance of
not doing anything that could touch off violence and lead to a
total breakdown in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   This official said Clinton cautioned that the result would be
loss of U.S. support for the Palestinian cause, which is ultimately
a peaceful settlement that will lead to the establishment of a
separate Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't support unilateral moves. Our focus will continue to
be on good faith negotiations,'' this official said.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the talks, it seemed naive of Clinton to think that
he could overcome the problems separating the two leaders no matter
how long he kept them captive at his rain-soaked retreat in the
Catoctin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, for example, registered strong objections about
convening a summit in the first place. He said in no uncertain
terms that he was not yet ready to make the hard concessions
necessary to strike a deal unless Israel honored previous
commitments concerning scheduled withdrawals from Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader even warned Clinton that anything less
than full sovereignty over east Jerusalem would be unacceptable, a
position he stuck to despite attempts by the president to get him
to accept Israeli and U.S. proposals.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official described Arafat's unwavering position as
similar to that of the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who in
1978 insisted on holding out for the return of all the Sinai desert
during the negotiations with former Israeli President Menachem
Begin and President Carter that yielded the Camp David Accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Arafat's mind, it really came down to swapping land for
peace,'' said this official. ``He felt he was being offered less
than what (the Palestinians) have a right to.``
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton pressed ahead and insisted again on Tuesday
after the summit that forcing the two sides into talks was ``the
right thing to do'' even if it meant dragging Arafat kicking and
screaming to the mountaintop retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was essential for Israelis and Palestinians finally to
begin to deal with the toughest decisions in the peace process,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said both sides now would at least be able to examine their
options more objectively as they pursue the ultimate goal of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is still working against us,'' he said referring to
the Sept. 13 deadline that both sides have imposed for completing a
deal and that Arafat has set as the date he will declare a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is we don't have a deal. The good news is they
are fully and completely and comprehensively engaged in an official
way for the first time on these fundamental issues,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Saeb Erekat, one of Arafat's chief aides, agreed, telling
reporters that Clinton's effort had made both sides realize ``more
than ever what it takes to make a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the exhaustive discussions on Jerusalem had also yielded
a view that it might be possible for the city to serve as the
capital for both Israel and a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem will stand as the capital of the state of Palestine
and the state of Israel. Jerusalem will be the place of freedom for
all,'' he said, adding that the prospects for negotiations to
succeed are much better now than before Clinton convened the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that the two sides are still far from an
agreement and not likely to get one if each continues to accuse the
other of being intractable.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, for example, blamed Arafat for the summit's collapse,
accusing him of not being ready to make the kind of sacrifices
necessary to make peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat was afraid to take the necessary, historical
responsibility at this moment to bring about an end of the
conflict. The positions of Arafat on Jerusalem were those that
prevented the achievement of an agreement,'' Barak said at a news
conference following the talks.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, he seemed to harden his own positions, saying that
none of the progress made in the talks on other issues would be
``binding'' or used as a starting point if and when future
negotiations occur.
</P>
<P>
   He also seemed to suggest that he had given all he can by
conceding a number of Arab neighborhoods in east Jerusalem to
Palestinian control and would not be able to move further toward
Arafat's demand that all of the old walled city be placed under
Palestinian sovereignty as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we must go to confrontation, we will be able to look our
children in the eye and say, we did everything, everything to
prevent a confrontation,'' he added, in apparent reference to
Arafat's threat to declare a Palestinian state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had offered as a final negotiating position parts of Arab
east Jerusalem. But the Palestinians insisted on full sovereignty
over all of east Jerusalem, including the OLD City. The only
exception they made was the city's Jewish quarter and the Western
Wall, which is Judaism's holiest site.
</P>
<P>
   In convening the talks, Clinton faced a difficult task not only
in trying to get the two sides to put aside deep religious and
cultural differences, but in getting them to disregard political
fallout at home in order to make difficult choices.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the summit, both leaders kept a watchful eye on
public opinion back in the region and may have adjusted their
positions during the summit because of it.

 &HT;    Concorde, Air France have ties to Atlanta aviation community

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Traffic came to a halt around Hartsfield International
Airport as the Concorde taxied to the runway for its first-ever
takeoff from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Lines of cars pulled over on roadsides and airplanes paused on
ramps so occupants could watch one of the most impressive
spectacles in aviation. It was an overcast day in October 1985, and
members of the Skylarks, an Atlanta travel club, had chartered the
luxury plane for a trip to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot came on the public address system and announced
that, since there were so many observers, he planned to make a
rather 'sporty' takeoff,'' remembers Hamp Vason, co-founder of the
Skylarks. ``Let me tell you, that was one dramatic way to leave
town. What a thrilling experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The symbol of European aerospace prowess leapt into the clouds
with its four afterburning jets roaring, then streaked into the
blue sky thousands of feet above. The plane stopped in New York,
then continued to London.
</P>
<P>
   Another chartered Concorde landed here in 1997 carrying European
vacationers on an around-the-world dash.
</P>
<P>
   Air France also has Atlanta ties.
</P>
<P>
   Air France and Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines headline an
alliance of international airlines, called SkyTeam, whose members
sell seats on some of each others' flights. The agreement does not
allow Delta to book seats on Air France's Concorde flights, though.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta spokesman said Tuesday the airline has hoped to expand
the ``code share'' deal to include Concorde flights. He added it is
too soon to say how Tuesday's crash might affect those plans.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and Air France jointly sell seats on trans-Atlantic
flights by regular jets, including those operated by the two
carriers between Atlanta and Paris. Delta also books passengers on
certain Air France flights from Paris to other parts of Europe, and
Air France does the same on some Delta domestic flights.
</P>
<P>
   Such alliances have become common over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The supersonic Concorde's visits to Atlanta demonstrate the
public fascination, economic obstacles and environmental
controversies the Concorde has evoked during its 31 years of
flight. Protesters and city officials almost blocked the 1985 trip
over concerns about noise. And the 1997 event was nearly canceled
when organizers couldn't sell enough tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde has been a perennial money loser for Air France and
British Airways even though almost all 100 of each flight's seats
are typically filled by passengers paying nearly $10,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Gourmet meals, unsurpassed customer service and posh terminals
cut into operating margins. Spare parts are increasingly rare and
costly. And the plane's extraordinary speed of 1,350 mph comes at a
price: The Concorde is a gas guzzler.
</P>
<P>
   Each Concorde burns more than its own weight in fuel during
every trans-Atlantic crossing. That's more than a B747-400, which
travels at slightly less than half the Concorde's speed but can
transport four times as many people and far more cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde had never had a fatal accident before Tuesday. But
a former flight dispatcher for Air France said the planes fly at
the edge of their aerodynamic capabilities all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Each plane takes off at its maximum weight in order to carry
enough fuel to cross the Atlantic, and the flight engineer must
constantly shift fuel among 11 tanks to keep the plane balanced.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the aerodynamic characteristics of the Concorde's
triangle-shaped delta wing make it unstable at slow speeds _
especially in a situation like the Paris crash, when one or more
engines apparently failed on takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Concorde wings don't have slats on the leading edges or
traditional flaps on the trailing edges to aid low-speed handling.
And the plane's downward sloping nose has been known to interrupt
air flow over the tail during takeoff and landing.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane operates normally, however, it is a marvel.
</P>
<P>
   A Concorde typically flies at altitudes up to 60,000 feet _
about twice that of most passenger jets. And it takes just three
hours, 23 minutes to fly from New York to Paris. Flying the
opposite direction takes three hours, 45 minutes against prevailing
winds.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers say the cabin noise level is slightly higher than on
other aircraft, and passengers sit two-abreast on both sides of a
narrow aisle. But there are typically six flight attendants on each
plane, or one for every 17 passengers, and service is unparalleled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying has been a big part of my life, and the Concorde was my
only chance to go supersonic,'' said the Skylarks' Vason, 70, a
former Air Force bomber and transport pilot. ``I imagine (Tuesday's
crash) will be the end of the Concorde program, and I find that
very sad.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the end of two weeks of marathon negotiations
with the leaders of Israel and the Palestinians, a visibly fatigued
President Clinton announced on Tuesday that they were unable to
reach an agreement ``at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and other American mediators made clear that it
was Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who balked in the end,
and by all accounts the issue was Jerusalem, the holy city both
Israelis and Palestinians claim as their sacred capital.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the White House, Clinton singled out the Israeli
prime minister, Ehud Barak, for his readiness to make hard
compromises. ``I would be making a mistake not to praise Barak,
because I think he took a big risk,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He also declared that the discussions at Camp David had been
``really unprecedented'' in raising issues ``that had long been
considered off limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Jerusalem in particular had never been discussed
before by Palestinians and Israelis in face-to-face encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the operating rules that nothing is agreed until
everything is agreed, they are of course not bound by any proposal
discussed at the summit,'' Clinton said. ``However, while we did
not get an agreement, significant progress was made on the core
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton convened the summit in an ambitious attempt to reach a
sweeping settlement before Sept. 13 on questions _ such as the
shape of a new Palestinian state, the future Palestinian refugees _
that have kept the two sides in a state of conflict for 52 years.
</P>
<P>
   None of the sides announced any immediate plans to resume talks,
and Arafat's declared intention to unilaterally proclaim a
Palestinian state on Sept. 13 imposed the next serious deadline on
a process that has see-sawed from hope to despair and back since
the Oslo agreements were signed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In a somber parting statement, Barak laid the full blame for the
setback on Arafat, and declared that Israel was prepared for
``every possibility.'' But he did not exclude another try: ``The
vision of peace suffered a major blow, but I believe that with good
faith, good will on all sides it can recuperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat made no comment before departing. But his chief
negotiators, Saeb Erekat and Mahmoud Abbas _ more commonly known as
Abu Mazen _ put an unexpectedly optimistic face on Camp David,
saying that the negotiations had laid groundwork for an agreement
by Sept. 13. ``What happened at Camp David are seeds that will grow
every fast,'' said Abu Mazen.
</P>
<P>
   The two-week sequestered talks at Camp David, which included
round the clock negotiations _ much of the time with Clinton as
mediator and go-between, as well as threatened walkouts and at
least one narrowly averted breakdown, marked one of the most
intensive mediating efforts by an American president in the Middle
East since Jimmy Carter brokered a peace between Israel and Egypt
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, it was hardly surprising, Clinton said, that
the summit, with its qualities of an almost brutal showdown in
close quarters, had not produced what he wanted. ``This is like
going to the dentist without have your gums deadened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, the Israeli and Palestinian leaders left the rainy
hills of Maryland for the Middle East confronting the potential for
increased violence and political uncertainty _ particularly in
Israel, where Barak faces criticism for considering concessions to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the comprehensive agreement the White House had hoped
for, the summit concluded with a five-point statement of
``negotiating principles'' agreed to by the Israelis, the
Palestinians and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The document said that the two sides understood the ``importance
of avoiding unilateral actions that prejudge the outcome of
negotiations'' and that differences would be resolved ``only by
good faith negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   More particularly, the national security adviser, Sandy Berger,
said it was Arafat who had a lot of thinking to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak was far more willing to think out of the box, far more
willing to consider, though he never accepted, solutions that could
have broken the log jam,'' Berger said. ``Arafat on the other hand,
while he did make some compromises on Jerusalem, was not prepared
at this point to crack open his traditional positions.''
</P>
<P>
   A best hope, Berger said was that the summit would provoke a
reassessment within the Palestinian delegation, a group of about a
dozen of Arafat's top political and security aides.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with the last days of the summit, the Egyptian
president, Hosni Mubarak, met with other Arab leaders in the Middle
East in a spurt of diplomacy, the goals of which were unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior administration official said Mubarak did not help
Arafat reach the bold decisions that the White House wanted. ``I
didn't see any evidence that a positive influence was being brought
to bear,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials involved in the negotiations, the
prospects for an accord finally fell apart just after midnight
Monday night, the second all-night session that Clinton had led
since returning to Camp David from Japan on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday and Monday nights, Clinton worked with negotiators
from both sides and progress was reported on the borders of a
Palestinian state, on the fate of the three million Palestinian
refugees scattered through the Middle East and on security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it came down to whether we could cut the Gordian knot on
Jerusalem,'' a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   For what turned out to be the last effort by the president to
get the Palestinians to agree to a deal on Jerusalem, Clinton met
with Arafat sometime after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Barak had made what the administration regarded as
considerable concessions in relinquishing control to the
Palestinians in the outer and inner suburbs of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The administration declined to go into precise details on
Tuesday, but in the last week of the summit, according to Israeli
reports, proposals were put forward by the Americans on concepts of
shared sovereignty in East Jerusalem. Barak was considering these
ideas which represented a radical departure from established
Israeli policy that Jerusalem was the united, undivided capital of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the ideas raised by the president were
far-reaching and justified a kind of positive response from Arafat.
They didn't,'' Barak told a news conference before is departure.
</P>
<P>
   But when Clinton spoke with the Palestinian leader, Arafat was
unwilling to budge from his position that East Jerusalem must be
the capital of the new Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The question of sovereignty over the holy sites in Jerusalem,
home to major places of worship for Jews, Christians and Moslems,
was at the heart of the problem, the administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of Jerusalem as four concentric circles,'' said the
official. ``Outer suburbs, inner suburbs, the Old City and the
religious sites. As you move into the center, the issues become
more intense, historical, religious.'' There was surprising
convergence on how different parts of the city would be managed,
but severe disagreement on the notion of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   In that last conversation between Clinton and Arafat while the
talks were still alive, Clinton tried to explain, once again, the
advantage for Arafat in making a compromise on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president described one again what was at stake: gaining a
state, international legitimacy, international economic support,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, if Arafat let an agreement pass by he could declare
a state, but it would be on 40 percent of the West Bank, and the
Israeli reaction would be strong _ possibly the forcible annexation
of the Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   After Arafat rebuffed Clinton, the president's senior aides _
Berger, the secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, and the
senior co-ordinator for the Middle East, Dennis Ross _ met with one
of the Palestinian's negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed, for one last time, the possibility of Arafat
accepting a partial agreement which would deal with the shape of a
Palestinian state, refugees and other matters but put the question
of Jerusalem aside for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   This last effort did not appeal to Arafat either, who, according
to the administration's account, felt he would lose some of his
leverage over Jerusalem if he settled on the other issues first.
</P>
<P>
   AT 3 a.m., Arafat, ensconsed in his cabin, called ``Birch,''
sent one of his negotiators to Clinton with a letter. The letter
politely thanked Clinton for his efforts but said that Arafat could
not accept the proposal on Jerusalem.

 &HT;    CONCORDE CRASHES NEAR PARIS, KILLING 113; 'BLACK BOXES'
RETRIEVED
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France _ An Air France Concorde, the swan-like
supersonic aircraft, crashed into a small hotel near a Paris
airport Tuesday after one of its four engines burst into flames
minutes after take-off.
</P>
<P>
   Nine crew members and 100 passengers _ most identified as German
tourists en route to a Caribbean cruise via New York City _ were
killed in the fiery crash that sent smoke high into the suburban
Paris skies for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were four people at Hotelissimo, which was engulfed
in the blaze fed by the aircraft's full fuel tanks. Another 14
hotel guests were hospitalized, police said.
</P>
<P>
   French television showed clips of the aircraft struggling to
maintain altitude with its left engines spewing flames. In images
that suggested the pilot's battle to keep aloft, the needle-nosed
plane banked before striking the hotel. The 45-room Hotel Relais
Bleu next door was unscathed. The crash took place about four miles
from Charles de Gaulle International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Nathalie Wycisk, a worker in a nearby office building who
watched the plane crash, told French TV that the pilot seemed to be
trying to turn the Concorde around. ``The pilot realized there was
an enormous problem and tried to turn around but the plane fell
straight down,'' she said. ``When it tried to accelerate it caught
fire behind. It fell directly on its wing. It wanted to
</P>
<P>
   turn around and boom, it just fell. Everything was shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after midnight, investigators recovered the flight data
and cockpit voice recorders _ the ``black boxes'' _ which will
provide vital data to help determine what caused the accident, the
first crash in the 30 years that the supersonic transport has been
flying.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of investigators will wait for first light Wednesday to
begin the grim and arduous task of examining the wreckage for more
clues to what happened. The U.S. National Transportation Safety
Board sent at least one investigator from Washington because the
Concordes fly into New York.
</P>
<P>
   After the intense blaze that took firefighters hours to
extinguish, there was little recognizable in the wreckage early
Wednesday morning. However, a bit of the blue Air France logo was
visible on a piece of fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were taken to a makeshift morgue set up at the
Jacques Brel amphitheater nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger list included 96 Germans, two Danes, one Austrian
and one American, as well as nine crewmembers, Air France said. The
American was a retired Air France employee, but the company did not
release a name.
</P>
<P>
   Among the eyewitnesses was Air France President Jean-Cyril
Spinetta. ``It seems there was a fire in one or more of the engines
on take-off,'' Spinetta told reporters at the crash scene.
</P>
<P>
   The crash did not appear to be linked to cracks found recently
in both British Airways and Air France Concorde jets. Air France
said this particular plane, in service since 1980, did not have
reported fissures.
</P>
<P>
   A former Concorde pilot told the BBC that he believed it would
take more than an engine fire to bring the plane down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have an engine fire you simply shut the engine down,
fire the fire bottles which put the fire out, dump fuel and come
down and land,'' John Hutchison said. ``The pictures I have seen
indicate something beyond a normal engine fire. That great long
plume of flame which is about as long as the airplane itself, a
couple of hundred feet, implies some sort of a catastrophic
failure, when the engine breaks up and blows apart.''
</P>
<P>
   British Airways and Air France _ the only airlines that fly the
Concorde _ grounded their fleets Tuesday and said they would wait
until Wednesday to announced whether they would resume operations.
</P>
<P>
   A symbol of Anglo-French cooperation, the first Concorde flew in
1969. With the crash, there are now 12 of the distinctive
delta-wing jets in the Air France and British Airways fleets. The
plane that crashed had flown 12,000 hours and had its last
mechanical checkup July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Police said three people on board the flight were under 18 years
sold. Five people on the ground were injured, police said. French
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who visited the scene, said their
condition was ``good from a medical standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   British businessman Darren Atkins told SKY-TV News that he was
aboard another aircraft behind the Concorde on the tarmac. ``As it
accelerated down the runway the engine was already smoking,'' he
said. ``Before it started to take off the left-hand engines were
visibly on fire. They were burning very heavily. So much so in
fact, on the tarmac was some debris that had clearly fallen off the
engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvie Lucas of Paris, who was at the airport waiting for her
children, also said she saw the plane on fire before it lifted off.
``We were waiting to hear the explosion because we thought it was
going to fall here (at the airport),'' Lucas told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers had been on a trip meant to savor: champagne on
the Concorde, then a leisurely cruise on the MS Deutschland through
the Panama Canal to Ecuador. Tour operator Peter Deilmann said the
cruise, which had a total of 510 passengers booked, would not be
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde, which crosses the Atlantic at 1,350 mph, has been
considered among the world's safest planes. Its only major scare
came in 1979, when a bad landing blew out a plane's tires. The
incident led to a design modification.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is popular with celebrities, world-class athletes and
the rich. It flies above turbulence at nearly 60,000 feet, crossing
the Atlantic in about 3 1/2 hours, much faster than regular
jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   A round-trip Paris-New York ticket costs $9,000, roughly 25
percent more than first class on a regular jet. A London-New York
round-trip runs $9,850. Air France officials have said in the past
that their current fleet was fit to fly safely until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, visibly moved, and French Transport Minister Jean-Claude
Gayssot visited the crash scene. ``It's a terrible moment,''
Gayssot said. President Jacques Chirac promised to pay homage
Wednesday to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokeswoman, Agathe Sanson, said Chirac was leaving
the airport at the time of the crash, having just returned from the
Group of Eight major industrial nations summit in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Condolences poured in from all over, including German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder and President Clinton. ``I wanted to extend the
deepest condolences of the American people to the families of those
who are lost,'' Clinton said.

COMMENTARY: A BABYSITTER FOR JUNIOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Bushworld, it's always Day 41 of Desert Storm,
that glorious day the president's approval ratings soared toward
91.
</P>
<P>
   The head-scratching choice of Dick Cheney is explained by the
fact he was in the bunker during the family's finest hour. They
would have preferred Colin Powell, who was also in the bunker
during their finest hour. But they let Brent Scowcroft, who was
also in the bunker during their finest hour, help seal the deal for
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to work up even a solitary goosebump for a
former staff member in the Ford White House. A prosperous,
well-fed, balding, bland, male Republican Washington insider and
former House leader who voted to the right of the NRA and Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Cheney was way, way out there, always willing to
pony up money to guerrillas in Nicaragua and Angola but not to poor
women whose lives were endangered by their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   When Trent Lott starts gushing about somebody, Katie bar the
door.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor who promised to be a ``different kind of
Republican,'' the candidate who used words like ``inclusive'' and
``compassionate'' and ``heart,'' is now running with a guy who
defended cop-killer bullets and plastic guns that could slip
through airport metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Million moms will love that.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush convention in Philadelphia will be gauzy, trying to
appeal to women, moderates and minorities, showcasing Elizabeth
Dole, Condoleezza Rice (also in the bunker at the finest hour),
John McCain, General Powell and Laura Bush. The opening theme is
``Leave no child behind.'' It will be delicious to see how the
Republicans deal with those Cheney votes against Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inclusive'' loses a little punch when you are running with
someone who in 1986 opposed a call to release Nelson Mandela after
23 years in prison, and often voted against the economic sanctions
that helped crush apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheney choice is about the past. But then, W.'s campaign has
always been less about vision than vindication. The dauphin must
reclaim the throne because the Bushes must restore the halcyon days
of the ruling-class court that thrived before that dissolute
commoner Bill Clinton usurped it.
</P>
<P>
   The family yearns to go back to the ``honorable'' days, the
golden era of Establishment reign _ before the decision not to go
into Baghdad began to fester, before Bill Clinton stole credit for
the thrumming economy, before first ladies went all weird on us.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was picked because he is the anti-Quayle. George I was
determined that George II would not repeat his mistake, choosing
someone young and callow. The ticket already had that covered.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1988 Cheney, then a House luminary, would have been a
good choice for George I. For George II, he comes across as the
baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has been minding Junior all year _ first coaching him in
foreign affairs, then helping him sort through his V.P. picks, and
now stepping in to provide a steady hand on the tiller.
</P>
<P>
   The past dictated the choice in this way as well: W., who had
loafed through long years when he could have been prepping for the
presidency, felt he needed some heaviness on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes hate being ``psychoanalyzed,'' as they call it. They
don't like personal questions. And yet they make many crucial
decisions based on personality.
</P>
<P>
   The father chose Dan Quayle and the son chose Dick Cheney for
the same reason: They wanted men who liked them, men with whom they
had ``a comfort level.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Cheney might have voted like Tom DeLay, he has a calm
and avuncular air. He vetted the other candidates, but he himself
was vetted by W. and Poppy, who, as usual, trusted their instincts.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt either Bush would have felt comfortable running with a
woman. Or with anyone who challenged their egos or made waves, like
John McCain. They need a history of loyalty, and they have a
preference for deference. Dick Cheney is one of their guys, in the
Club. And they know best.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Bushes mess up any more vice-presidential picks, for
Jeb or George P., they might want to stop checking their gut and
start checking the voting record.
</P>
<P>
   A ticket with two rich white Texas oilmen who went to Yale,
avoided Vietnam and act more moderate than they are? For the
Bushes, that's a perfect fit. (BOX)

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush formally introduced his
running mate, Dick Cheney, to a cheering crowd here Tuesday,
praising the former defense secretary and longtime family friend as
a man of ``great integrity, sound judgment and experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As Cheney stood almost bashfully at the side of the beaming,
ebullient Texas governor, Bush tacitly acknowledged the oddity of
his months-long search for a vice presidential nominee ending with
the selection of the searcher himself.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney had been tapped by Bush to supervise that process in late
April. But over the ensuing weeks and months, Bush said: ``I
benefited from his keen insight. I was impressed by the thoughtful
and thorough way he approached his mission. And, gradually, I
realized that the person who was best qualified to be my vice
presidential nominee was working by my side.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cheney took Bush's place at a lectern set up in front of a
row of 30 American flags, his remarks _ only half as long as the
governor's _ suggested that Bush had found a No. 2 with precisely
the kind of loyalty that the governor had always said he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enthusiastically accept the challenge,'' he told Bush, ``for
this reason: I believe you have the vision and the courage to be a
great president, and I want to do absolutely everything I can to
make certain that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it had been clear for several days that Cheney would
almost certainly be the governor's choice, their joint appearance
in a large meeting room here Tuesday marked the first formal
acknowledgment by the Bush campaign that Bush-Cheney was the ticket
with which the Republican Party would try to win the White House.
The two men's wives, Laura Bush and Lynne Cheney, shared a modest
stage with them.
</P>
<P>
   In turning to Cheney, Bush chose someone whose extremely
conservative record between 1979 and 1989, when he represented
Wyoming in the House of Representatives and reliably cast votes
against abortion rights and gun control, was sure to provide
Democrats and liberal interest groups with fodder for their
assertions that a Bush presidency would tilt sharply toward the
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is probably as far right as anybody in the Republican Party
today,'' said Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic
minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The selection also raised questions about how Cheney, who was
entrusted with the task of screening other potential vice
presidential nominees, was put through the process himself. Karen
P. Hughes, the director of communications for the Bush campaign,
said Tuesday that Bush had taken on at least part of that chore,
subjecting Cheney to the sorts of questions about finances and
other personal information that Cheney had asked other contenders.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush did appear to accomplish several goals at once by
picking Cheney. The governor supplemented his own limited career in
government, confined to the five and a half years that he has
presided over the nation's second largest state, with the
accumulated wisdom of a man who served as chief of staff under
President Gerald R. Ford and then spent a decade in the House
before his appointment as defense secretary in 1989 by President
George Bush, the governor's father.
</P>
<P>
   And because the selection of Cheney did not on its face
represent an overtly political calculation, it enabled Bush to
maintain his claim to being someone who is more interested in good
government than political gamesmanship, someone who is more deeply
wedded to principles than to polls. There was no discernible
electoral strategy at work: Cheney maintains homes in Texas and
Wyoming, two states that Bush should easily win in November.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the remarks that Bush and Cheney made Tuesday amounted
to a preview of that pitch. ``Governor Bush is seeking not only to
win an election, but also to lead our nation,'' Cheney said in a
voice that was softer, deeper and steadier than Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, Bush had said: ``I have to admit something. I
didn't pick Dick Cheney because of Wyoming's 3 electoral votes,
although we're going to work hard to earn them. I picked him
because he is, without a doubt, fully capable of being the
president of the United States. And I picked him because he will be
a valuable partner in a Bush administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The word partner suggested something else that Bush had been
looking for: someone with whom he felt a strong sense of comfort
and an equally strong sense of trust. Cheney clearly fit that bill,
partly because of his history with Bush's father, partly because he
helped the governor assemble a team of foreign policy advisers last
year and then got to know Bush even better over the last three
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously family-tested _ loyal all the way back,'' said
Professor Bruce Buchanan, a historian who teaches courses on the
presidency at the University of Texas and has closely monitored
Bush's career. ``He's comfortable _ they've developed a
relationship as a consequence of this search process.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan suggested that Cheney might also help fill any deficit
of gravitas that voters perceived in Bush. ``It's in keeping with
the great pains that he has taken all along to build a shadow
government that's made up of people who quiet the fears that he's
shallow and out of his depth,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Many prominent Republicans sold the selection a different way:
as evidence that Bush, 54, was so secure in his own abilities and
confident in his own leadership that he would recruit a teammate
like Cheney, 59, who looks at least 10 years older than the
governor and has a much longer political resume. Alternately,
Republicans said that Cheney's selection was proof that Bush was
earnestly filling in the gaps in his own experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sending a powerful signal that he's continuing his
preparations to become the president,'' said Gov. John Engler of
Michigan in a telephone interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Engler and other Republican leaders expressed enthusiasm about
the choice, saying that Cheney had a reputation on both sides of
the political aisle as a thoughtful, reasonable, intelligent
politician.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said that
when Cheney worked on Capitol Hill, ``he was not the kind of guy
who was threatening or in your face or, you know, partisan to the
extent that others didn't feel like they could work with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Cheney is just one of those people, if you're around him
any length of time, you just feel very comfortable with him,'' Lott
said. ``You grow to have a healthy respect for him.'' In fact, Lott
added, he told Cheney several months ago that he would be the best
choice for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, whom many House Republicans had
promoted for a place on the ticket with Bush, said Tuesday that
Cheney's ``leadership skills are proven in many areas. He has an
incredibly impressive resume.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least a few other Republicans were puzzled. They
questioned why Bush, who has pledged to expand the Republican
Party's appeal and bring a fresh perspective to Washington, would
pick a running mate with such conservative bearings and such strong
ties to the Republican establishment of the past.
</P>
<P>
   And they wondered why Bush, long eager to emerge from his
father's shadow, would summon it anew with the choice of someone
from his father's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to a lot of observers _ and there's a lot of buzz
about this _ like this reflects his father's influence,'' said one
Republican strategist. ``And the campaign has spent two years
saying that his father doesn't have a big influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican strategist said, ``For all the running away
he's done from his father, now he's Velcroed himself to the old
man. It's the old Bush. It's just unfortunate. The Democrats are
gloating.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Tuesday that the only active role that former
President Bush had played in the process, other than being a
sounding board for his son, was to call a prominent cardiac surgeon
who is a family friend and ask him for his opinion on Cheney's
health. Cheney suffered three mild heart attacks more than a decade
ago and had bypass surgery in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers moved quickly Tuesday to dispel any doubts about
Cheney's physical fitness for the long road to November _ and
possibly beyond. The Bush campaign released letters from Cheney's
doctors at George Washington University that provided a detailed
synopsis of Cheney's medical history.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference following Bush's introduction of Cheney,
Hughes was even able to answer a question about the specific food
allergy mentioned in one of these reports. The allergy was to
pomegranates, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes also made a point of mentioning that when Bush, at home
in the governor's mansion Tuesday morning, placed a telephone call
to Cheney's house in Dallas to offer him a place on the Republican
ticket, Cheney was exercising on his treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney did not take any questions from reporters, but
the brief, prepared statements that they read hinted at an
evolution in their relationship over the last three months. Hughes
described it in more detail, and according to these accounts, Bush
had asked Cheney in March, right after the governor effectively
secured his party's presidential nomination, if he would be willing
to be considered for the vice presidential nomination. Cheney said
no.
</P>
<P>
   But about three weeks ago, Hughes said, Bush asked Cheney again,
and elicited a different response.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' Bush said, ``he said he was willing to talk with
his family and consider it.'' He smiled broadly, and Cheney reached
over to his wife, Lynne, patted her on the shoulder, then held a
pair of crossed fingers in the air. The crowd of about 200
supporters and friends of the Texas governor laughed loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney provided an unusual physical counterpoint to Bush, whose
facial expression and demeanor conveyed an almost boyish
excitement. Cheney, by contrast, seemed to be trying to hide his
grin. He often cast his eyes downward and could not decide what to
do with his hands, which were alternately deep in his pockets and
clasped modestly in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were scheduled to take a campaign trip to Wyoming on
Wednesday, and Bush's aides said that on Friday, when Bush begins a
five-day trek to the Republican national convention in
Philadelphia, Cheney will accompany him for the first day's stops
in Arkansas and Missouri. Aides said that Cheney will then return
to Dallas, where he is chief executive of Halliburton, an energy
company, to put some business affairs in order before turning his
full attention toward the presidential race.

AMAZON.COM PRESIDENT RESIGNS UNEXPECTEDLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN COOK and KATHY MULADY   
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Joseph Galli joined Amazon.com as president and
chief operating officer last June, the former Black &AMP; Decker
executive said he was looking forward to ``making history'' at the
Seattle online superstore.
</P>
<P>
   But Galli Tuesday became a short chapter in the Amazon.com
history books.
</P>
<P>
   In an unexpected move, the 42-year-old executive announced his
resignation from Amazon.com and said he would become chief
executive of Horsham, Pa.-based VerticalNet. He worked at
Amazon.com 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me this is just a great, great career move,'' Galli said.
``It is not about the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Galli's departure came a day before Amazon.com and VerticalNet
are expected to announce second quarter earnings. It also comes one
month after Galli received a $3 million one-year-anniversary cash
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the president of a company resigns it does raise
questions,'' said Todd Weller, an analyst at Legg Mason Wood
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Banc of America Securities analyst Tom Courtney expressed
concern. He cut Amazon's stock rating from ``strong buy'' to
``buy'' and withdrew his $80 per share price target saying that he
has ``lost some confidence'' in the company's growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com fell as much as 14 percent in early trading, hitting
a low of $33.25 before rebounding to close at $37.63, down $1.13
for the day. VerticalNet, which has lost more than half its value
in the past four months, climbed 63 cents to close at $57.38. On
the day Galli joined Amazon.com last summer, the company's stock
closed at $56.81.
</P>
<P>
   Galli earned $200,000 a year in salary at Amazon.com, but also
received a $3 million signing bonus, and a one-year bonus of $3
million on his anniversary at the end of last month. He would have
received another $2 million if he had stayed one more year. Galli's
original incentive package also included options to purchase 1.47
million shares through 2009 and 2.45 million shares from 2009 to
2019 at $57.95 a share. As a result of the resignation, Galli will
forfeit his Amazon.com stock option package. Under the terms of his
employment agreement, Galli will have to pay back about $250,000 of
the $3 million signing bonus he received on his first anniversary.
Galli also will give up his board seat at Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Galli's lucrative bonus package, Weller said: ``I
bet Amazon is not too happy about that.'' Galli, who did not
disclose his compensation package at VerticalNet, said he fully
expects Amazon.com to honor the terms of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   A Pittsburgh native who spent 19 years at Black &AMP; Decker in
Maryland, Galli said he wanted to return to the East Coast where
his family still resides. Galli's children live near Baltimore,
about an hour and half drive from VerticalNet's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sad to leave Amazon and Jeff Bezos was very good to me,''
said Galli, in a conference call. ``I can't think of having a
better mentor in the new economy than Jeff.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, Galli started discussing his family
situation with Bezos and indicated that he might want to leave the
company. When he was offered the CEO position at VerticalNet, which
is located in a Philadelphia suburb, Galli said it was the perfect
fit.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hagan, VerticalNet's co-founder and chief operating,
said the company was not actively looking for a CEO. But when the
executive team met Galli for the first time earlier this year, he
said there was instant chemistry and they decided to ``make room on
the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are a professional football team and you see a great
player on the draft board, you have to grab him,'' Hagan said.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message to employees, Amazon.com chief executive
Jeff Bezos said he wishes Galli all the best in his new pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that you know this is a peaceful parting, I'll tell you
that I served as Joe's top reference with VerticalNet just
yesterday,'' Bezos wrote. ``Joe is a talented executive who really
helped us over the last year. I would ask all of you to join me in
wishing him the very, very best.''
</P>
<P>
   Bezos will continue as CEO and resume the duties of president.
Warren Jenson, who joined the company at about the same time as
Galli, also with a generous signing package, remains as Amazon's
chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Galli backed out of a job with
short notice. Before joining Amazon.com, Galli reportedly accepted
the chief executive position at Frito Lay North America. But a day
after accepting the job at the snack food maker, Galli told them he
was not interested and would go to Amazon.com instead. Galli
downplayed questions about job-hopping, saying his 19-year career
at Black &AMP; Decker through multiple management shakeups speaks for
itself.
</P>
<P>
   VerticalNet, in many ways, is the Amazon.com of
business-to-business e-commerce. It operates 57 industry-specific
Web sites, including Aerospace Online, Nurses.com and
SolidWaste.com.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the five-year-old company is much smaller than Amazon and
not as well known among consumers. It employs just over 650
employees and recorded revenues of $20.7 million last year.
Amazon.com, with more than 7,000 employees, reported sales of $1.6
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably a combination of wanting to be closer to his
family, along with his own ambition,'' said Adam Hamilton, a
research analyst at McAdams Wright, Ragen in Seattle. ``He is a
young, energetic and a smart guy. That's why the company brought
him in to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Galli's departure is a loss for Amazon.com. He was credited with
streamlining the company operations during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this is something that makes people nervous, look
what the stock did today,'' said Hamilton, commenting on
Amazon.com's 2.9 percent stock drop. ``But I think the company can
survive this. I am impressed across the board with the talent they
have. The loss of one person isn't a nail in the coffin.''

RUSH TO JUDGE DICK CHENEY BEGINS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush said
Americans should judge him by the decision he made in choosing a
running mate, a decision he revealed Tuesday as former Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to judgment is on.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives applauded Cheney as a man of conservative values
that include opposition to abortion and whose Washington experience
balances the Texas governor's limited resume as a national and
international player.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals and Democrats portrayed Cheney as anti-woman, anti-gay,
anti-environment and pro-gun. Bush, a former oilman, and Cheney,
chairman and CEO of the oilfield service company Halliburton Co.,
were quickly labeled the ticket of big oil.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney can be seen as the steady hand who helped Bush's father,
former President George Bush, guide the nation through the Persian
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Or he can be seen as the hawkish defense secretary who asked
Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell to draw up plans for
the possible use of nuclear arms against Iraq during that conflict.
Powell responded, ``We're not going to let that genie loose,''
according to Powell's book on the war.
</P>
<P>
   The next several weeks will determine whether Cheney is a plus
for Bush or an albatross _ much as the selection of the
inexperienced Dan Quayle was for his father's 1988 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   An overnight Gallup poll released Tuesday found the public views
Cheney ``as a competent, though not exciting, choice.''
</P>
<P>
   A solid majority of those polled said Cheney was a good choice
and said he would be prepared to serve as president if needed. They
also said the selection reflected favorably on Bush's
decision-making ability.
</P>
<P>
   But only 14 percent of those surveyed said they would be more
likely to vote for Bush because of Cheney, and 10 percent said they
would be less likely. Most people said the selection of Cheney
would make no difference in how they vote.
</P>
<P>
   That matches what Bush strategist Karl Rove has been privately
telling people for a year: A presidential election is won or lost
by the nominee. A running mate may help a ticket a little, but the
main thing is to find a vice presidential candidate who does not
hurt the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney appears to fit the bill of that ``safe'' pick, though
Democrats already are using Cheney's congressional voting record to
paint Bush as a right-wing extremist on the ``all-oil, all
anti-choice Bush-Cheney ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, Bush did not pick Cheney to help him carry a
major state that he needs to rack up an electoral victory. Cheney
lives in Dallas, and his native state of Wyoming is firmly in
Bush's corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit, I didn't pick Dick Cheney because of
Wyoming's three electoral votes,'' Bush said in making the
announcement. ``I picked him because he is without a doubt fully
capable of being president of the United States and he will be a
valuable partner in a Bush administration.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, what Cheney brought was something Bush lacked:
Washington experience.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is a reassuring figure to the Washington Republican
establishment whose faith in Bush, backed by millions of dollars in
donations, was shaken when the Texas governor lost unexpectedly in
the New Hampshire primary to Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's conservative voting record during a decade in Congress
and firm position opposing abortion also ensured that the plans for
a positive and unified Republican National Convention next week in
Philadelphia would not be split over a vice presidential pick who
might favor abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   And Cheney's history in Congress of working in a bipartisan
manner fit right in with Bush's effort to portray himself as a
different kind of Republican who will end partisan bickering in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign handed out copies of statements that Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, made as a
senator when Cheney was before the Senate for confirmation as
defense secretary in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you how much your colleagues and former
colleagues who had the privilege of serving with you in the House,
as I did before coming to the Senate, respect you and wish you well
in this new endeavor to come,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   But besides questions about Cheney's health, Bush also has to
contend with questions about how the man who headed his vice
presidential selection committee came to be his running mate. Bush
said his trust, faith and friendship with Cheney grew through the
process.
</P>
<P>
   University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said
inevitably voters will wonder: ``Maybe Dick Cheney ruled everybody
else out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Karen Hughes said Cheney maintained the integrity
of the process by giving Bush the names of several other potential
running mates.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been suggestions in the past of Cheney
manipulating a vice presidential selection.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1980 book, An Inside Account of the Ford Years, Robert T.
Hartmann, a former aide to President Ford, said Vice President
Nelson Rockefeller complained to him that Cheney _ then Ford's
chief of staff _ had helped engineer Rockefeller's removal from the
1976 presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush looking youthful and fit at age 54 and Cheney
appearing older than his 59 years with his thinning white hair,
glasses and plump physique, Bush may occasionally have to remind
voters which member of the team is in charge: It is the Bush who is
the Texas governor, not the former president.

 &HT;    CONCORDE CRASHES NEAR PARIS, KILLING 113; 'BLACK BOXES'
RETRIEVED

<P>
   GONESSE, France _ An Air France Concorde, the swan-like
supersonic aircraft, crashed into a small hotel near a Paris
airport Tuesday after one of its four engines burst into flames
minutes after take-off.
</P>
<P>
   Nine crew members and 100 passengers _ most identified as German
tourists en route to a Caribbean cruise via New York City _ were
killed in the fiery crash that sent smoke high into the suburban
Paris skies for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were four people at Hotelissimo, which was engulfed
in the blaze fed by the aircraft's full fuel tanks. Another 14
hotel guests were hospitalized, police said.
</P>
<P>
   French television showed clips of the aircraft struggling to
maintain altitude with its left engines spewing flames. In images
that suggested the pilot's battle to keep aloft, the needle-nosed
plane banked before striking the hotel. The 45-room Hotel Relais
Bleu next door was unscathed. The crash took place about four miles
from Charles de Gaulle International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Nathalie Wycisk, a worker in a nearby office building who
watched the plane crash, told French TV that the pilot seemed to be
trying to turn the Concorde around. ``The pilot realized there was
an enormous problem and tried to turn around but the plane fell
straight down,'' she said. ``When it tried to accelerate it caught
fire behind. It fell directly on its wing. It wanted to
</P>
<P>
   turn around and boom, it just fell. Everything was shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after midnight, investigators recovered the flight data
and cockpit voice recorders _ the ``black boxes'' _ which will
provide vital data to help determine what caused the accident, the
first crash in the 30 years that the supersonic transport has been
flying.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of investigators will wait for first light Wednesday to
begin the grim and arduous task of examining the wreckage for more
clues to what happened. The U.S. National Transportation Safety
Board sent at least one investigator from Washington because the
Concordes fly into New York.
</P>
<P>
   After the intense blaze that took firefighters hours to
extinguish, there was little recognizable in the wreckage early
Wednesday morning. However, a bit of the blue Air France logo was
visible on a piece of fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were taken to a makeshift morgue set up at the
Jacques Brel amphitheater nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger list included 96 Germans, two Danes, one Austrian
and one American, as well as nine crewmembers, Air France said. The
American was a retired Air France employee, but the company did not
release a name.
</P>
<P>
   Among the eyewitnesses was Air France President Jean-Cyril
Spinetta. ``It seems there was a fire in one or more of the engines
on take-off,'' Spinetta told reporters at the crash scene.
</P>
<P>
   The crash did not appear to be linked to cracks found recently
in both British Airways and Air France Concorde jets. Air France
said this particular plane, in service since 1980, did not have
reported fissures.
</P>
<P>
   A former Concorde pilot told the BBC that he believed it would
take more than an engine fire to bring the plane down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have an engine fire you simply shut the engine down,
fire the fire bottles which put the fire out, dump fuel and come
down and land,'' John Hutchison said. ``The pictures I have seen
indicate something beyond a normal engine fire. That great long
plume of flame which is about as long as the airplane itself, a
couple of hundred feet, implies some sort of a catastrophic
failure, when the engine breaks up and blows apart.''
</P>
<P>
   British Airways and Air France _ the only airlines that fly the
Concorde _ grounded their fleets Tuesday and said they would wait
until Wednesday to announced whether they would resume operations.
</P>
<P>
   A symbol of Anglo-French cooperation, the first Concorde flew in
1969. With the crash, there are now 12 of the distinctive
delta-wing jets in the Air France and British Airways fleets. The
plane that crashed had flown 12,000 hours and had its last
mechanical checkup July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Police said three people on board the flight were under 18 years
sold. Five people on the ground were injured, police said. French
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who visited the scene, said their
condition was ``good from a medical standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   British businessman Darren Atkins told SKY-TV News that he was
aboard another aircraft behind the Concorde on the tarmac. ``As it
accelerated down the runway the engine was already smoking,'' he
said. ``Before it started to take off the left-hand engines were
visibly on fire. They were burning very heavily. So much so in
fact, on the tarmac was some debris that had clearly fallen off the
engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvie Lucas of Paris, who was at the airport waiting for her
children, also said she saw the plane on fire before it lifted off.
``We were waiting to hear the explosion because we thought it was
going to fall here (at the airport),'' Lucas told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers had been on a trip meant to savor: champagne on
the Concorde, then a leisurely cruise on the MS Deutschland through
the Panama Canal to Ecuador. Tour operator Peter Deilmann said the
cruise, which had a total of 510 passengers booked, would not be
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde, which crosses the Atlantic at 1,350 mph, has been
considered among the world's safest planes. Its only major scare
came in 1979, when a bad landing blew out a plane's tires. The
incident led to a design modification.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is popular with celebrities, world-class athletes and
the rich. It flies above turbulence at nearly 60,000 feet, crossing
the Atlantic in about 3 1/2 hours, much faster than regular
jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   A round-trip Paris-New York ticket costs $9,000, roughly 25
percent more than first class on a regular jet. A London-New York
round-trip runs $9,850. Air France officials have said in the past
that their current fleet was fit to fly safely until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, visibly moved, and French Transport Minister Jean-Claude
Gayssot visited the crash scene. ``It's a terrible moment,''
Gayssot said. President Jacques Chirac promised to pay homage
Wednesday to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokeswoman, Agathe Sanson, said Chirac was leaving
the airport at the time of the crash, having just returned from the
Group of Eight major industrial nations summit in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Condolences poured in from all over, including German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder and President Clinton. ``I wanted to extend the
deepest condolences of the American people to the families of those
who are lost,'' Clinton said.

EARLIER GENERATION OF ADOPTEES FROM KOREA RECALL GROWING UP ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Though he left in 1959, when he was 5, Thomas Grover
Masters can recall vivid details of his childhood in Korea: The
rationed powdered milk he used to eat because it was sweetened. The
three nights he spent sleeping next to his mother's body when,
unable to care for her three children alone, she poisoned herself.
The yellow beret his uncle gave him when he was sent to the
orphanage in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   After he was adopted and brought to America, some of his
memories were edged out by new experiences: Catholic school and the
track team, bacon and eggs. His name, Suh Ung Ki, became Tommy; his
new sister, a Korean girl his age who was adopted at the same time,
was called Mary Jane. English words blotted out Korean. He forgot
the names of his biological brother and sister. He even forgot,
almost, that he was Korean at all.
</P>
<P>
   As Tommy and Mary Jane grew up in Wichita, Kan., their parents
had no map to navigate the psychological journey from there to
here; they did not know a word of the language their new children
spoke. They were advised that it was best to help Tommy and Mary
Jane forget the shell-shattered world they had left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Today, international adoptions are nothing like what Masters
experienced. Would-be parents are screened for cultural
sensitivity. They join adoption support groups. Children go to
culture camps, language lessons, and play groups for adopted kids.
At a conference in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., last weekend organized
by a group for adopted Koreans and their families, race was the
most prominent topic for the 400 families attending.
</P>
<P>
   As children learned Korean-style brush painting in one part of
the Hasbrouck Heights Hilton on Saturday, Masters advised parents
on the importance of learning about their children's native
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents need to realize that to the children, adoption is also
a sense of loss,'' he explained. ``Loss of their roots, parts of
their personal identity, their biological parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, the children don't even realize that they
have lost this part of themselves until much later.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a speech Masters, 46, is making more and more often, at
all kinds of adoption-related gatherings, not just those focused on
Korea. He also helped found Also Known As, a New York group of
about 300 younger adults, adopted themselves, who now serve as
mentors to adopted children. Koreans his age have been the first to
speak about growing up unprepared to face a world that perceived
them as Asian when they saw themselves as American.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that Korean adoptees have taught the rest of the
adoption community is that absence does not take away the
importance of culture,'' said Margie Perscheid, an adoptive parent
from Washington who helped organize the weekend conference. ``These
adult adoptees can tell the adoption professionals who thought they
knew it all that they were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   While adoption professionals are quick to point out that only a
small fraction of the thousands of adoptive families in the United
States participate in cultural awareness events and support groups,
they say more and more parents are seeking guidance on how to
handle the issue of race in their families.
</P>
<P>
   Guy and Tina Lindgren came to the conference from the
predominantly white town of Conway, Ark., hoping to get pointers
from other adoptive parents on bringing up their adopted son,
Andrew, 22 months. ``Andrew is not your average Arkansan, and
pretty soon he's going to know that,'' Lindgren said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lindgrens said they read about Korea regularly, and plan to
take Andrew there when he is 4 or 5 to visit his old foster
parents. The family, including Andrew, is learning Korean from a
Korean student attending a nearby college.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950's, adopting foreign children was so unusual that
local newspapers often covered the event. Many older adoptees
growing up in small towns never saw another Asian, much less
another adopted Korean.
</P>
<P>
   Although scattered international adoptions took place after
World War II, families in which the children looked markedly
different from the parents began to appear after the Korean War.
Harry Holt, a deeply religious Oregon farmer, and his wife, Bertha,
decided that the Lord intended for them to save Korean war orphans
who had been fathered, and then deserted, by American GI's. The
Holts adopted eight babies. And determined to find homes for
hundreds more Korean children, they started an agency, Holt
International Children's Services. Between 1955 and 1960, 3,500
Korean children were adopted by American and European families.
</P>
<P>
   While nowadays, more children are adopted each year from Russia
and China, South Korea's system remains the model for international
adoptions, and there are more than 100,000 adopted Koreans in the
United States. Last year, about 16,000 children were adopted from
overseas, 2,000 from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Masters regularly fought with other children
because he looked different, and his sister was taunted at school.
But he was proud when Mary Jane, as the only ``exotic'' beauty on
the local modeling agency's roster, was hired to dress up as a
Native American and hand out cigars, and to sit on the lap of
Wichita's mayor as he rode in a rickshaw for Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I was concerned, Korea, Japan, China _ those areas
were all the same,'' Masters, 46, said in an interview in his
apartment in East Brunswick, N.J. After college, Masters worked as
a Wichita police officer, then went to law school and became an
agent at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. His sister, Mary Jane
Brooks, now works as a nanny in Niceville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, shortly after Masters was hird, the FBI sent him to
Las Vegas, where he was invited to a Korean Lions Club dinner.
There, he said, he encountered a roomful of Koreans for the first
time since leaving his native country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It completely destroyed all the stereotypes that I ever had of
Asians,'' he said, remembering his shock at seeing his hosts drain
tumblers of bourbon when he had been told that Asians were unable
to handle alcohol _ a myth he believed even after he began drinking
himself. The experience prompted him to learn more about his roots.
</P>
<P>
   For other adopted adults, curiosity about the past was kindled
in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Dottie Enrico, 41, a New York journalist who grew up in Indiana,
became interested as she recognized how she appeared to others.
``If people were going to see me as Asian,'' she said, ``it became
really clear to me that I owed it to myself to know what that
meant. It was something that belonged to me that I missed having.''
Her first visit to Korea in 1997 led her to adopt a Korean child,
Eleanor, now nearly 2.
</P>
<P>
   The journey back to Korea, whether metaphorical or actual, can
be rough. In Korean society, adoptees are seen as victims of
misfortune, and adoptees say Koreans there and here sometimes
reject them for being too Western or for not speaking better
Korean.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some adoptees think adoptive parents can approach the
job of educating their children with too much zeal. Hollee
McGinnis, 28, who founded Also Known As with Masters' help, said
some parents clung to their children's ethnic identity as if it
were their own, or treated their forays into Asian culture as an
exotic adventure. She cautioned against forcing culture camps and
language lessons on a reluctant child. She said she was glad that
her parents had not talked openly about her ``Koreanness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent half my life not having to think about being Asian,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But adoptive parents say they want to give their children the
tools to deal with who they are in a complex cultural landscape.
``Many adoptive families really do consider themselves to be the
harbingers of a new way of looking at race,'' said Perscheid, the
conference organizer.
</P>
<P>
   But people like Masters and Enrico are not so sure. They said
that all else being equal, it would be less traumatic for children
if they could find homes in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, both were also quick to say that adoption gave
them a better life than they would have if they had remained in
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would be cleaning up the streets,'' said Masters,
now a new-media and international-trade consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``it would have added so much more quality to
my life, knowing that we weren't alone.''

<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ The refusal of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, to negotiate away his claims to Jerusalem may have dashed
U.S. hopes of a Camp David peace agreement Tuesday, but it allowed
him to return home with his credibility among other Arab and Muslim
leaders intact, Middle East analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is expected to solidify that backing with a round of
consultations in the region, beginning in Egypt on Wednesday
morning with a visit to President Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian
port city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials here said that Arafat would probably meet
soon with many of the Arab leaders who had urged him, in public
statements and private telephone conversations, to hold firm on his
demands for an end to Israel's 33 years of control over East
Jerusalem and the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   The question of Jerusalem, which contains sites holy to Muslims
and Christians as well as to Jews, was said to have been the main
sticking point in the intense negotiations at Camp David in pursuit
of a settlement to the long Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official reaction from Arab capitals to the
announcement that the Camp David talks had ended. A spokesman for
the Arab League in Cairo said officials would wait until Arafat
briefs them on his negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Arab television channels, which are state owned, reported the
end in the talks without commentary.
</P>
<P>
   However, on the Al-Jezeera satellite TV station, owned by a
member of the ruling family of the Gulf state of Qatar, and one of
the few outlets for debate in the Arab world, the analysis was
overwhelmingly supportive of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton said Israel compromised more than the Palestinians,
but this is not accurate,'' Helmi Barakat, a political analyst
based in Washington, said in a an Al-Jezeera interview. ``According
to international law, Jerusalem is occupied land, and I do not
believe the Arabs should be expected to compromise or give up their
sovereignty over Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few days, a number of Arab leaders, from Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to Mubarak, have joined with
Arafat's domestic opponents in various Islamic militant movements
to weigh in on the issue. They all but threatened Arafat with
political excommunication if he accepted Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's proposals for only administrative control over parts of the
city and access to _ but not sovereignty over _ the major Muslim
sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of many analysts, however, Arafat did not need any
reminders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat knew beforehand that any compromise on Jerusalem would
be the end of Arafat,'' said Tahsin Basheer, a former aide to Anwar
Sadat, the late Egyptian president who was the first Arab leader to
make peace with Israel, in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials also said Arafat was acutely aware,
throughout the peace talks, that Jerusalem was an especially
sensitive issue for the Arab leaders whose support he needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that here in Egypt, just like in Saudi Arabia, in
Jordan and elsewhere in the region, the leaders have to worry about
their own home constituencies when it comes to Jerusalem,'' said
Mohammed Subieh, the general-secretary of the Palestine National
Council and the Palestinian representative in the Arab League in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Arab control of the Old City has been a rallying cry not only
for Palestinian nationalists through the years. It has also been a
slogan for the Islamic fundamentalist movements that have mounted
violent opposition to any Arab regime that attempts to normalize
relations between Arabs and Israelis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An uncompromising view toward the status of East Jerusalem,
which was controlled by Jordan from 1947 until 1967, has also been
the standard position of Arab religious leaders, both Christian and
Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, who has been actively involved in the Arab-Israeli
peace effort for years, conferred several times with Arafat during
the talks. But he did not follow the U.S. line and push Arafat to
compromise, as he has in the past on issues other than Jerusalem,
Egyptian officials and diplomats in Cairo said.
</P>
<P>
   As Mubarak's information director, Maged Abdel Fattah, said
earlier this week, the Egyptian president saw his role as helping
U.S. diplomats, and not Arafat, understand that Christian and
Muslim Arabs around the world can accept only certain
``parameters'' when it comes to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Clinton said in his post-mortem on the negotiations,
these were the first substantive talks between an Arab leader and
an Israeli leader on the subject of Jerusalem. But outside the
confines of the presidential retreat, analysts said, they also
revived old shibboleths and emotions that could be difficult to
contain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going home, on the face of it, empty-handed, creates a problem
of damage control,'' a former diplomat said. ``Fourteen days of
uninterrupted negotiations made the anti-peace forces on both sides
very active. Everyone is trying to remobilize their forces and
their arguments, even arguments from 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials, however, expressed some hope that some
agreement could be salvaged before mid-September, when Arafat has
pledged he will declare a Palestinian state. ``Let us wait and
see,'' said Subieh when asked if the pledge would be kept.
``Clinton has promised to send one of his senior people to the
region, and we are hoping that will help.''
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, another Palestinian official said he hoped to
see broad Arab support rallied behind Arafat so that he could
continue to negotiate. ``There is still a chance until Sept. 13,''
Marwan al-Bargout, a leader of the Palestinian Fatah faction, said
on Al-Jezeera. ``We are calling upon Arab nations and leaders to
support the Palestinians and hold an emergency Arab summit.''

   GONESSE, France _ A supersonic Air France Concorde carrying
mainly German tourists bound for a cruise ship in New York crashed
in flames shortly after take-off from Charles de Gaulle Airport
outside Paris Tuesday, killing all 109 passengers and crew on board
as well as at least four people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only crash of a Concorde since the world's first
supersonic passenger plane went into commercial operation in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses said one or both of the plane's left engines were
on fire and smoking heavily even as the aircraft sped down the
runway. They said it had failed to gain height, banked heavily to
the left and then crashed, demolishing a small hotel and restaurant
in Gonesse, a suburb nine miles north-east of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Air France identified the passengers on board the chartered
flight AF4590 as 96 Germans, two Danes, one Austrian and one
American. The American was a retired Air France employee, but the
company did not release a name. The nine crew members, three pilots
and six stewardesses were all French. French government officials
said those killed in the hotel included three staff members _ two
Polish and one French _ and one British tourist. Five others were
reportedly injured, four of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The two black boxes _ the flight recorder and the cockpit voice
recorder _ were located a few hours after the crash and handed to
investigating officials, said the head of the French civil aviation
authority, Pierre Graf.
</P>
<P>
   The crash came just weeks after cracks were discovered in the
wings of several aging Concordes. Jean-Cyril Spinetta, the
president of Air France, said cracks had been found in four of the
airline's six Concordes, but not on the one that crashed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no possible link between the engine and these
cracks,'' he told reporters at scene. He added that the Concorde
that crashed Tuesday entered service in 1980 and had undergone a
mechanical check up as recently as last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft had been chartered by a German tour company, Peter
Deilmann Reederei GmbH &AMP; Co, based in the northern German town of
Neustadt. Deilmann, the company's chief executive, said the
Concorde's passengers were scheduled to join a luxury cruise ship,
``Deutschland,'' Tuesday evening in New York at the start of a
16-day tour of the Caribbean, traveling through the Panama Canal to
Manta in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the crash, which occurred here at 4:44 p.m.,
airport emergency trucks arrived on the scene to find flames and
smoke engulfing both the remains of the plane and the remnants of
the hotel, a wooden building called Hotelissimo. Dozens of police
vehicles and fire trucks soon arrived, and the area was immediately
cordoned off.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, with planes again leaving Charles de Gaulle
airport and flying over the wreckage, firemen were still trying to
put out the fire, which continued to spew thick, white smoke across
a nearby highway and wheat fields.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists who reached the area were kept at a distance of some
100 yards, but they could see darkened pieces of the plane's
fuselage as well as a solitary wheel and what looked like one of
the turbines. Only a tiny section of the 45-room hotel remained
standing, charred and ruined. The wreckage of the plane was
confined to a small area, a little larger than its own size,
seemingly confirming eyewitness reports that it fell on its left
side and tipped over on its back.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The crash and the minutes preceding it were witnessed by a
number of people, both at the airport and around Gonesse. Even now,
more than 30 years after the plane was unveiled as the pride of the
British and French aviation industries, passengers and airport
workers routinely turn their eyes toward the runway to watch the
aircraft's swan-like form take to the air. Tuesday was different
only because smoke and flames were spewed from the plane's engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hadn't left the ground and already it was on fire,'' said
Sylvie Lucas, who had gone to the airport to pick up her children,
who were on another flight. ``The flames were coming from the back
of the plane. We were waiting to hear the explosion because we
thought it was going to fall here.''
</P>
<P>
   A photograph of the ill-fated Concorde in the air, taken by a
young Hungarian plane-spotter, showed flames stretching some 60
feet behind the aircraft.

Europe with the Blue Brothers jazz band, said he looked up and saw
the Concorde on fire. ``It looked just like virtual reality,'' he
said. ``Of course, we all knew what it was. And there was nothing
on earth you could do. It looked like it was trying to ascend, but
its nose was down. First there was smoke, then there was fire, then
it just went nose in and all that was left was a white billowy
cloud.''

   Other witnesses who watched the crippled plane as it flew toward
the southeast also anticipated the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw its rear engine in flames,'' said Samir Hossein, 15, a
student in Gonesse who was playing tennis at the time. ``We saw it
lose altitude, it chopped off those trees near the hotel and headed
to the ground. The pilot tried to bank, but the plane rolled over
and hit the hotel nose first and turned over.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who visited the scene of the crash
some two hours after the disaster, said the plane's pilots
apparently had time to signal an emergency because the runways at
both Charles de Gaulle and the nearby Le Bourget airports were
ordered cleared. ``But the plane could not return, even though it
tried,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Willy Corenthin, 29, an electrician who saw the crash as he
drove on a nearby highway, said he also heard an explosion while
the plane was still in the air. ``I saw smoke and flames coming
from the engines, then I heard an explosion, and the plane heaved
to the left and crashed,'' he said. ``When it fell, it seemed to
fall very slowly, then the smoke and flames erupted. I didn't hear
another explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the plane with a full fuel load demolished the small
building of the Hotelissimo hotel, it narrowly missed an adjacent
and larger hotel, Les Relais Bleus. The owner of Les Relais Bleus
said he saw the burning plane heading towards him and fled. If it
had continued another 300 yards, it would also have crashed into
the town of Gonesse, presumably causing many more deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had fallen on Gonesse, it would have been an
unbelievable disaster,'' said Corenthin, who echoed the views of
several local residents who felt the pilot had steered the plane
away from the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the pilot was trying to avoid more populated areas,''
said Christine Turpin, who saw the flaming plane flash by just 150
feet above her gasoline station. ``I think he was trying to get
back to the airport or land in a field.''
</P>

   On Tuesday night, the French transport minister, Jean-Claude
Gayssot, said he had asked the civil aviation authority to cancel
all Concorde flights Wednesday. In London, a spokesman for British
Airways, the only airline apart from Air France to fly the plane,
said that Tuesday evening's flights to and from New York had also
been canceled. But a spokesman for the British Civil Aviation Board
said it had no intention of grounding the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, British Airways grounded one of its seven
Concordes after cracks were found in its wings, but the remaining
six in its supersonic fleet continue to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Britain's BAE Systems and France's Aerospatiale
Matra, the successors to the companies that built the aircraft,
said they were forming a joint investigating team. The U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board said it was also sending an
investigator to Paris to work with the French team.
</P>
<P>
   Experts from Rolls-Royce, the manufacturer of the engines, were
traveling to Paris to investigate the apparent failure of one or
two of the plane's four Olympus 593 engines.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France as well as Jospin expressed
condolences to the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, who in
turn noted that ``Germany and France are united in their horror
over the accident, in mourning for the victims and in sympathy for
the families.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also spoke of the crash Tuesday. ``Like all of
you,'' he told reporters, ``I have just heard the news of the crash
of the Concorde outside Paris, and I wanted to extend the deepest
condolences of the American people to the families of those who are
lost.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Concorde, which can fly at 1,350 miles per hour at some
60,000 feet above sea-level, has long been regarded by France as
proof of its technological prowess. Even though supersonic travel
never caught on widely, it has been a favorite of prosperous
businessmen and show business personalities who welcome being able
to cross the Atlantic in around half the time _ just three and a
half hours _ of regular commercial flights. For the convenience,
roundtrip tickets can cost up to $11,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Concorde only makes the return flight to New York three
times a day _ once from Paris and twice from London _ its aura of
romance and luxury has made it popular for charter by travel groups
catering to the well-heeled.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the plane, which was first flown in tests in 1969,
has had a good safety record, albeit with sporadic difficulties. In
January, two British Airways Concordes made emergency landings
within a 24-hour period, one after an engine switched off, the
other after a fire alarm went off in the cockpit. On at least three
occasions, the rubber tires on the Concorde's landing gear have
exploded upon landing. But in those and other incidents, no
passenger has ever been injured.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Air France has predicted that its fleet of
Concordes would continue flying until at least 2007.

SPACE STATION LINKUP SUCCESSFUL 
 

</HEADLINE>
 STATION-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S.-led international space station successfully linked up
with its tardy Russian crew module late Tuesday, adding living
space for future resident astronauts and cosmonauts to the slowly
developing orbital outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The linkup occurred 7:45 p.m. CDT, as the 43-foot-long module
coasted more than 229 miles over central Asia. The milestone sets
the stage for a flurry of long-delayed assembly missions.
</P>
<P>
   The docking of the unpiloted spacecraft drew to a dramatic close
as a combination of two other modules that were launched and joined
in late 1998 to kick off the station's assembly crept within range
of the crew module and docked.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and American experts supervised and monitored the
automated rendezvous operation from mission control facilities in
suburban Moscow and the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confirmation of contact and capture,'' Kyle Herring, a
NASA spokesman at the Moscow facility ``Everything has gone exactly
by the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Also known as Zvezda, Russian for ``star,'' the 42,000-pound
crew module lifted off late July 11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in
Kazakhstan, its departure stalled 27 months by Russian economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The crew module's arrival promises to unleash 15 station
assembly and supply missions by the United States and Russia over
the next 12 months. Those include the launching in late October of
the embryonic station's first resident crew, American commander
Bill Shepherd and cosmonauts Sergei Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko.
They plan a three- to four-month stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really happy we've got this milestone behind us,''
Shepherd said after the docking. ``You have a lot of happy
astronauts and cosmonauts.''
</P>
<P>
   First up, however, will be the lift off, tentatively scheduled
for Aug. 6, of a Russian Progress cargo capsule, the first of
dozens of the unmanned spacecraft that will be needed to keep the
station stocked with supplies and fuel to keep it circling the
Earth at safe altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The American shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to follow in early
September with seven astronauts and cosmonauts. They will deliver
more supplies and unload the Progress to prepare the station for
the arrival of Shepherd and his crew.
</P>
<P>
   In early October, the shuttle Discovery and another crew of
seven will follow with the first large segment of external
trusswork and streering gyroscopes. Another shuttle crew will
arrive before Thanksgiving with the first U.S. solar power
generator.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-2001, subsequent shuttle missions will deliver the
bus-sized U.S. laboratory module and equipment to outfit it for the
wide range of physics, biology and medical experiments that are
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   As the equipment aboard it are gradually activated, Zvezda will
act as the station's central nervous system as well as its crew
habitat. Its systems will furnish guidance, propulsion and
communications as well as living quarters for three occupants,
cooling, air and water re-generation, a toilet and galley.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in spite of the many new capabilities it affords the orbital
outpost, the crew module also arrived with several previously
disclosed safety lapses the Russians were unable to resolve without
additional delays.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd and his crew will be required to wear ear protection
because of the high internal noise levels. The station's first
occupants will plan to augment the noise dampening insulation and
install quieter air flow fans as a remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The module also lacks adequate external shielding for long term
protection from impacts with micrometeorites and small bits of
man-made space debris. It will likely be another four years before
all of the additional shielding required for better protection can
be launched and installed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NASA is proceeding with plans initiated more than a
year ago to purchase at least $35 million in new hardware for the
station from the Russian Aviation and Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency said there is no link between the purchases and
warnings from top officials of RSC Energia, one of Russia's most
influential aerospace contractors, that their country's future
contributions to the new station are underfunded.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings followed the launching of the crew module.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the Russians say every bit of cash they can get
helps because they need the money to pay their suppliers,'' said
Kirsten Williams, a NASA spokeswoman in Washington. ``But in terms
of these particular procurements there is no where else to get
these things.''
</P>
<P>
   The first purchase is for $14 million in Russian docking
mechanisms. The hardware would allow two different American
propulsion modules to dock with the station. The modules would keep
the station safely aloft in the event the Russians were unable to
launch adequate numbers of Progress capsules with fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents in Congress have criticized the purchase because it
rewards the Russians for failing to keep their commitments to the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the $35 million would pay for a range of
safety, ground test and life support equipment. The hardware
includes a Russian version of a backpack mounted jet pack worn by
spacewalking astronauts. The device enables spacewalkers to propel
themselves back to the station if their safety tethers are severed
during a stroll in space.
</P>
<P>
   The second installment would also cover the cost of a device
that purifies condensate from the station's air conditioning system
into drinkable water. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ After blanketing Central Park, Staten Island and
parts of Queens with pesticide in a stepped-up campaign to knock
out the West Nile virus, city officials were preparing to spray
Roosevelt Island and a large section of Manhattan Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a day after they announced that the virus had been
detected in mosquitoes in the city for the first time this year,
officials said they were still planning to attack mosquitoes
primarily from the ground, spraying the pesticide Anvil from
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread aerial pesticide spraying was used last year when an
outbreak of West Nile, a mosquito-borne disease, killed 7 people in
the New York area and sickened 55 others. City officials said
Tuesday that they had received permission from the state to use
helicopters to drop a bacterial larvicide that kills mosquito eggs
in the wetlands of Staten Island, but they said they planned to
rely on ground spraying in residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, city health officials announced that they had found
mosquitoes infected with the virus in three sample pools one in
Central Park and two on Staten Island, that were tested as part of
a surveillance program.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials reported on Tuesday that West Nile had
been found in two more samples of mosquitoes, both in Rockland
County, bringing to eight the total number of mosquito pools in New
York that have tested positive for the virus. In New Jersey, no
mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus, and in Connecticut
one pool has tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have placed 120 mosquito traps at more than 70 spots
around the city, and the state provides weekly reports of the test
results.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Staten Island, where last week two dead crows tested
positive for the virus, had already been treated, but after the
virus was found in two mosquito pools there, the rest of the
borough was sprayed Monday night and yesterday morning, officials
said. Neighborhoods in Queens, and a small section of Brooklyn,
were to be sprayed Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   And in Manhattan, areas from 23rd Street to 110th Street,
between the East River and the Hudson, and on Roosevelt Island were
scheduled to be sprayed from midnight Wednesday to 5 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of West Nile virus in Central Park, in a pool of
54 mosquitoes trapped near 63rd Street and Fifth Avenue, prompted
the city to close all 843 acres for overnight spraying Monday and
to postpone a New York Philharmonic concert until Tuesday night.
The Central Park spraying began at 10 p.m. Monday and ended at 5
a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half hours after it ended, the park was bustling with
joggers, cyclists and in-line skaters, many of whom said they were
not concerned or did not know about the pesticide spraying. But it
was another story with the dog owners.
</P>
<P>
   The usually crowded dog run near West 72nd Street had only a few
of the regulars Tuesday, and those who took their dogs out for a
walk were trying to avoid the grass, fearing their pets would
ingest the pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uncanny that there's nobody here,'' said Dana Weiss, 48,
who was walking her golden retriever, Buddy, and said she was
surprised to see so few dogs around. ``This is very odd.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said she normally walked her dog for 45 minutes, but she
had limited it to 10 minutes and kept him on a leash, even though
dogs are allowed off a leash until 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Ginsberg, 45, walked into the park with her two dogs
about 8:30 and discovered that she had little company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is everybody?'' she said, pulling a newspaper out of her
bag and glancing at the headlines. When she saw that the park had
been closed the previous night for pesticide spraying, she looked
down at the dogs, Angelo, a bichon frise, and Valentina, a Maltese,
and said, ``I have to go to Riverside,'' and left the park. &QL;

USC'S KUYUMJIAN MAKING NAME FOR HIMSELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Being the new kid on the block wasn't all that
difficult for Alex Kuyumjian, but that probably had a lot to do
with the success he enjoyed in his first season with the USC golf
team in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Kuyumjian, a transfer from College of the Canyons in Santa
Clarita who also graduated from Westlake High, began last season at
the bottom of the Trojans' depth chart but wound up the team's best
finisher at the Pac-10 Championships, and he is building on his
spring success with a productive summer.
</P>
<P>
   Kuyumjian's last two tournaments were the biggest of his career.
Two weeks ago, he played in the U.S. Public Links Championships in
Milwaukie, Ore., and survived the stroke-play cut before losing in
the first round of match play to Andy Sanders of the University of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kuyumjian played in the California State Amateur,
with similar results _ stroke-play survivor, first-round exit _ but
experience is more important than results to a player such as
Kuyumjian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' the 21-year-old said. ``The PubLinks course
(Heron Lakes Golf Club) was probably one of the toughest I have
ever was a USGA setup, so just making it to match play was an
accomplishment in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, Kuyumjian, who will attempt to qualify for the
U.S. Amateur next week, will carry over this success to the Trojans
he will begin practicing for his junior season in just a couple of
weeks. If the Trojans are lucky, he will build on last year's
success.
</P>
<P>
   He came in as something of an unknown, an outsider who was seen
as a threat to golfers who had already spent a year or two on the
team and who weren't particularly enthused about giving up their
spot in the regular tournament rotation. But Kuyumjian couldn't be
ignored for long and he was a postseason Pac-10 all-conference
selection, long after he had already earned the respect of his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I didn't really feel quite in place,'' Kuyumjian
said. ``After a while, though, the chemistry of the team started to
things got a little bit easier for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was gradual, but I can understand that. These guys really
didn't know a whole lot about me, so there was definitely an
adjustment period.''
</P>
<P>
   The adjustments continue for Kuyumjian, who now must prove he
can succeed in Division I golf on a consistent basis. And he isn't
about to shy away from a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he set out to maintain a scoring average of 72 and
finished at 72.7, which gives him more motivation to perform well
in his second year at USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to set goals for myself every year,'' Kuyumjian said.
``Maybe this year I'd like to get my average down to 71 and keep
setting the standards higher every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always something for me to work on with my game, but
I'm definitely excited about this season. Last year I got a change
to show people what I could do and I want to keep improving as time
goes on.''

BAN ON EXECUTING PREGNANT WOMEN; BUSH PERE IN THE BACKGROUND 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BAN ON EXECUTING PREGNANT WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who supports abortion rights, had said
earlier this month that if a pregnant woman faced execution, ``The
principle of a woman's right to choose governs in that case.''
Today the House voted unanimously that it did not. In reaction to
Gore's statement that pregnant women on death row should be able to
choose whether they are executed before the birth of their child or
after, the House voted, 417 to 0, to prohibit any state from
executing a pregnant woman. No one has shown that the circumstance
has ever arisen. The sponsor of the bill, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,
R-Fla., said unborn children had committed no crime.
Abortion-rights advocates said the bill was intended to advance the
cause of abortion opponents by elevating a fetus to the status of a
child. The bill now goes to the Senate, where its future is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH PERE IN THE BACKGROUND
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's wife, Laura, and his 24-year-old nephew,
George P. Bush, will have featured roles at next week's Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia. And George P.'s father, Gov.
Jeb Bush of Florida, will be doing the rounds of television
interview shows off the convention floor. But former President
George Bush and his wife, Barbara, the biggest Bush stars at the
show other than the nominee, will remain mainly in the background,
as they have throughout most of the campaign, with no speaking
roles that might steal the limelight from their son. ``We want to
be careful it doesn't turn into a Bush family reunion,'' one of the
convention's co-chairmen, Andrew Card, said Tuesday. Card said
Laura Bush would speak to the convention on one of the early nights
and that later George P. and his Mexican-born wife would have a
featured role, mainly to underscore the work they have been doing
in recent months to promote George W.'s candidacy among Hispanics
and younger voters.

HIGH-TECH PRIVACY SLEUTH JOINS RESEARCH CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By   MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard M. Smith, a software engineer turned high-tech sleuth
who tracks how personal data is gathered via the Internet, said
Tuesday that he would join forces with researchers at the Privacy
Center, a new group based at the University of Denver that
investigates privacy concerns in the information age.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the center, which is to be formally announced
Wednesday, said they would gather data on whether and how personal
information was captured by software makers, operators of
communications systems and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the center would focus initially on whether personal
privacy was jeopardized by the use of wireless phones with Web
access, digital television set-top boxes, software that can send
user information back to its maker over the Internet and other such
new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look at anything to do with a computer, and stuff that
is networked together,'' said Smith, who helped track the possible
origins of the malicious ``Melissa'' and ``I Love You'' computer
programs. ``We'll focus on how we're being monitored in our daily
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he was looking forward to helping other people use
some of the techniques he had developed. ``We're trying to train
other people to do the work I do,'' said Smith, a co-founder of
Phar Lap Software, Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Among Smith's accomplishments in recent years was the discovery
that the Microsoft Word program embedded a unique identifier in
users' computers that was sent back to Microsoft when the software
was registered. Microsoft subsequently stopped putting the
identifier in the software. Smith has also explored the
data-collection practices of Amazon.com and RealNetworks. He filed
a complaint last year with the Federal Trade Commission asserting
that Alexa software, a subsidiary of Amazon, could gather far more
personal data about consumers than Amazon told customers it was
collecting.
</P>
<P>
   Smith technically is not affiliated with the University of
Denver, but has signed on as the chief technology officer of the
Privacy Foundation. The foundation is a Denver-based nonprofit
agency _ also scheduled to be announced today _ that is financing
the privacy center. The Privacy Foundation was started and is
largely underwritten by Peter Barton, a Denver entrepreneur and
former chief executive of the Liberty Media Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The financing will help support research at the university by
David Martin, an assistant professor of math and computer science,
and three associates. They will work with Smith, who will work
mainly from his home in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than Richard being the lone ranger, he's going to have
a posse to help him,'' said Stephen Keating, executive director of
the Privacy Foundation. Keating said the foundation's first-year
budget would be around $1 million.

NEWS ANALYSIS: DESCENDING THE SUMMIT INTO VALE OF UNCERTAINTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS graf bgng `It was perplexing...' to clarify.) 
(With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ And on the 15th day, the Israelis and the
Palestinians packed their bags and left their pastoral retreat at
Camp David empty-handed, exhausted and still in conflict. In
immediate retrospect, the hope that they could have resolved a
52-year-old, blood-soaked dispute in a fortnight seems like the
summit of idealism.
</P>
<P>
   With the potential for violence looming, what happens now to
this prizefight of all ethnic, religious and territorial conflicts?
The Palestinians entered swinging, and the Israelis left swinging,
and while the American referees bounced quickly back to their feet,
it is unclear when and if the two sides will re-enter the ring. In
the end, did the meeting help or hurt the peace effort?
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton described it on his return to the White
House Tuesday, he believed that he was compelled to force the issue
by convening the talks. After seven years of stop-and-start peace
negotiations, with the threat of an impending return to violent
conflict, there was no longer any reason to avoid an official
grappling with the thorniest points. It was time for a moment of
reckoning, for the leaders to stare at themselves in the mirror and
also face ``the abyss,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But before the Camp David meeting, Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, repeatedly said that the moment had not
arrived, that the talks were premature, that the groundwork had not
been laid. Perhaps he should have been heeded. As Prime Minister
Ehud Barak repeated Tuesday, it does take two to tango.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and U.S. officials knew that in general, Arafat makes no
decision before its time, and Arafat's personal working deadline is
Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   That is when the most recent interim peace agreement expires,
and when the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership has
pledged to unilaterally declare a state if a permanent peace has
not been reached _ an action that could provoke a chain of
unilateral actions and violent events.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the best possible face on the meeting's failure to
produce an agreement, Clinton asserted that the Israelis and
Palestinians had broken seven years of official silence to conduct
``unprecedented'' discussions on emotional issues like Jerusalem.
He said that the parties had made significant progress on every
core dispute, and U.S. officials said that they expect the peace
process to continue after a period of ``reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak made it clear that he believed the present ``chapter''
of peacemaking had reached an end. Addressing reporters at the
Hampton Inn in Frederick, Md., Barak spoke as if he had already
moved on. ``If we have to go to a confrontation,'' he said, ``we
will be able to look straight into the eyes of our children and say
we did everything, everything in order to prevent a
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Having reportedly offered concessions on every issue, Barak, who
has staked his political career on the single goal of peacemaking,
does not apparently see a clear path ahead. He called the summit
meeting a ``significant milestone and, at this point, the last one,
in intensive and deep negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   All understandings reached at Camp David, he said conclusively,
were moot, vanished into the mist that clouded the talks during two
weeks of intermittent rain and a steady news blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's somber assessment did not square at all with the
uncharacteristically upbeat one offered by a senior Palestinian
negotiator Tuesday afternoon. Speaking in Pentagon City, Saeb
Erekat said emphatically that Camp David had paved the way for a
peace agreement by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of an agreement is much stronger than ever
before,'' Erekat said. ``What happened at Camp David are seeds that
will grow very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a perplexing optimism, although it may have expressed a
certain amount of anxiety that the Palestinians had squandered some
reserves of American good will toward their cause. But after two
weeks in intensive, round-the-clock negotiations during which the
U.S. president pushed aside nearly all other business, the Israeli
and the Palestinian leaders explored every issue and, particularly
in regard to determining the sovereignty of Jerusalem, hit a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Why would lower-level negotiations be able to progress further,
or, if the leaders reassembled, why would the picture change?
</P>
<P>
   After all, Erekat continued to insist Tuesday that all would be
well and good provided that Barak does what he has said he cannot
do _ acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of both Israel and the
future Palestine. Is Jerusalem an inexorably intractable issue, or
is there some give on either side that somehow was not discovered
in the seclusion of the Catoctin Mountains but will emerge later?
</P>
<P>
   Arafat will return home to a hero's welcome, not just in the
West Bank and Gaza but in the Arab world, whose capitals he will
tour immediately.
</P>
<P>
   His popularity at home, lower than ever before he departed, will
be boosted by the perception that he faced down Israel and a
superpower without conceding any of what Palestinians consider
their sacred principles, especially the sovereignty of East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that everyone will go out to applaud Arafat and say
to him, `Welcome home, Mr. President,''' said Hani al-Hassan, a
member of the central committee of Arafat's Fatah movement.
</P>
<P>
   It is more complex for Barak. Right before he left, he lost
three right-leaning parties from his broad coalition. Leaving
without a government and returning without an agreement, he faces a
good deal of uncertainty, and any uncertainty about his political
future clouds the prospects for peace, too.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has political options that would involve alliances
incompatible with any immediate progress at the peace tables. What
he cannot do is continue at the head of a minority government,
representing only 42 out of 120 members of Parliament. It is not
sustainable; he would not be able to accomplish anything.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Barak will bring home a one-page, trilateral
statement reaffirming the value of making peace. It is a long way
from an accord.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Camp David represents a significant juncture in the
history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But where it will
lead, beside through a thicket of diplomatic and political
complications, is impossible to predict.

SPACE STATION IS CONNECTED TO MODULE FROM RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A long-awaited Russian component docked with the
International Space Station on Tuesday night, marking what project
planners hoped would be a resurgence in construction of the orbital
outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian service module, named Zvezda or ``star,'' and the
two components making up the budding station closed on each other
and docked at 8:45 p.m. Eastern Time while soaring 230 miles above
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contact is confirmed,'' said Kyle Herring, a NASA commentator
at the Russian control center outside Moscow as applause broke out
in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Latches on the space station closed to secure the new module,
which is to serve as the command and living headquarters for
international crews while the station is being built.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda, a 42,000-pound pressurized section the size of a city
bus, joined two previously orbited units that together weighed
70,000 pounds to form the core around which the rest of the $60
billion research station could be built.
</P>
<P>
   Late arrival of the 43-foot-long Zvezda, delayed more than 19
months because of financial problems in cash-strapped Russia and
trouble with the Proton booster rocket that eventually sent it into
space two weeks ago, has stymied space station construction and
strained the international partnership sponsoring the ambitious
project.
</P>
<P>
   After confirming the attachment of Zvezda to the station and
testing the airtight seal between components over the next three
days, computers in the new module are to assume control over the
entire complex as it awaits a space shuttle crew, due in early
September, to complete the matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's activities were the culmination of a two-week orbital
ballet in which Zvezda slowly worked its way up to the two
previously launched space station components. Zvezda had an almost
flawless launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan atop a
three-stage Proton rocket on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the usual two-day trip to the existing station,
flight controllers decided to take two weeks to move the units
together so that they could thoroughly test Zvezda's systems before
the docking attempt. Engineers took the time to test the command
module's power and guidance systems, maneuver its giant solar power
panels, and check out the docking systems.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of rocket firings, the final three of which occurred
last Friday and Saturday, the new module moved to a 224-mile-high
orbit to await the rendezvous with the space station.
</P>
<P>
   After all of its previous activity, Zvezda let the space station
take the lead in the final stages of the rendezvous, approaching
Zvezda and controlling the docking operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian control module is the third of what are to be
two-dozen major components of the International Space Station, a
project involving 16 nations, led by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The partners, including members of the European Space Agency,
Canada, Japan, Brazil and Russia, have so far spent billions of
dollars building more than 300,000 pounds of equipment and supplies
for the station. When completed in five years, the research outpost
is to be a complex of six laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda, which cost about $340 million, is the first station
module fully financed by Russia. Experts said it also is one of the
most essential components of the station, a necessary building
block on which the rest of the outpost is constructed.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda not only provides living quarters for the initial crews
to staff the station, but it also is to command the station's
position in space and control all electrical, computer,
communications and flight systems for the complex. The module,
which is almost identical to the core component of the Russian Mir
space station, also will be the base for spacewalks needed to
maintain the station and help in its expansion.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year-and-a-half, the station has consisted of
just two components that could not be expanded without the critical
service module. The Russian-made, but American-financed, control
module, called Zarya, became the first part of the station launched
in November 1998. The following month, an American space shuttle
took up an American docking module called Unity. American shuttles
visited the complex twice since then to outfit it, perform
maintenance and boost the station's altitude, which slowly
decreases because of atmospheric drag.

 &HT;    Concorde provides mega-dose of refined traveling
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Crossing the Atlantic Ocean aboard the
supersonic jet, the Concorde, is a journey of elegance and
refinement, even if the legroom is a mite cramped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seats are comfortable, the service is superb and the food
is excellent,'' said former Palm Beach Mayor Yvelyne ``Deedy''
Marix, who has made the transatlantic flight aboard the
needle-nosed aircraft several times.
</P>
<P>
   Marix and her late husband, Nigel, owned Embassy Travel in Palm
Beach for more than 30 years before selling it in the mid-1980s.
She last flew aboard a Concorde more than a decade ago in
connection with her travel consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I infinitely prefer it to a 747,'' she said. ``It's like
comparing oysters to a green dress.''
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde provides an unending stream of gourmet food and
drink, served on crystal, china and linen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jumbos are huge and packed with people,'' Marix said. The
Concorde holds only about 100 passengers. ``Even in first class or
business class, people bump you with their luggage trying to get
through. The Concorde is more like a private airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   The real attraction, of course, is that it crosses the ocean at
60,000 feet at 1,350 mph and can reach London from New York in
three hours, 50 minutes, about half the time of regular jets.
</P>
<P>
   Such speed and luxury come at a price: $10,000 for a round-trip
commercial flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to get where I'm going (fast),'' said Palm Beach
attorney and real estate broker Martin Klein, who formerly did work
for both Air France and British Airways, which operate the
remaining 11 Concordes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a marvelous experience and a wonderful way to minimize
jet lag. If you're traveling from London to New York, you can
arrive before you left,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   The tall and the bulky find it cramped, however, and there are
no telephones, headphones or in-flight movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you're high enough to actually see the curvature of the
Earth and generally you're unaffected by the weather or other air
traffic,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, no Concorde had crashed in the plane's 30-year
history. The closest call came in 1979 when a hard landing blew out
some tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are aging,'' Klein said. ``Perhaps it's time for a
second-generation Concorde.''
</P>

SPORTS COLUMN: WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO DOG DAYS? 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summers used to be _ he groused in an indeterminate American
accent _ for sitting on the front porch and listening to Chuck
Thompson or Harry Caray, night games, day games, doubleheaders on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, halfway through the summer, the five best sporting
events of last weekend all had a decidedly foreign edge to them.
</P>
<P>
   Over in Scotland, there was Tiger Woods turning a legendary golf
course into pitch-and-putt.
</P>
<P>
   Over in France, there was Lance Armstrong pedaling up the
Champs-Elysees as casually as my riding my old Schwinn down to buy
the papers in the morning. Easier, actually, because Lance did not
have to dodge frenzied yuppies barely able to control their SUV's
while babbling distractedly on their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the interesting part about this international weekend was
that it was not one of those canned Olympic programs in which every
medalist was a Yank. Over in Spain, there was John McEnroe,
rendered nearly speechless, if you can imagine that, by a bagel job
(a shutout, in tennis colloquialism) in the Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And down in Costa Rica, there was a Jamaican soccer referee,
auditioning to be a Don King factotum or maybe a figure-skating
judge, dreaming up a penalty that would cost the United States the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Sacramento, two of the greatest sprinters, Michael
Johnson and Maurice Greene, went down in a grotesque daily double.
(Yes, yes, I know, technically, the trials were held in California,
but essentially track and field does not exist in the United States
until every Summer Games, so I'm counting this event as foreign.)
</P>
<P>
   All this hands-across-the-sea exotica tends to cut into the
baseball that used to sustain us in these lazy, hazy days.
</P>
<P>
   The most exciting event of the weekend was Barry Larkin of the
Reds whipsawing two slick young general managers, Jim Bowden and
Steve Phillips, by bleating that he did not want to be a migrant
laborer in New York and promoting a three-year contract from
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Reds are threatening to raise ticket prices while the
season is in progress, just to teach the fans a lesson for siding
with Larkin. What a wholesome concept for baseball: a loyalty tax.
</P>
<P>
   Things seem far less odious from a distance. One thing you can
say about Woods and Armstrong: nothing about their triumphs even
vaguely smacks of hype.
</P>
<P>
   Woods flicked the hard Scottish countryside into submission,
demolishing every cliche and bad joke about golf. Then there are
the commercials that show Woods tapping the ball with his club and
blasting one into the stratosphere. Maybe this could be parlayed
into X-golf, taken over by Vince McMahon, no more tee shots but
golfers facing live pitching. From Roger Clemens. NBC would love
it.
</P>
<P>
   As for Armstrong, he deserves all the praise he gets not only
because he is a recovering cancer patient, but also because he
dominated the television by pedaling around one of the most diverse
and beautiful countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Having covered a couple of Tours, I can remember how the weary
riders would receive 45-minute massages, like inert hunks of meat,
just so they could hobble off to supper and bed and somehow get
back on their machines the next morning. Spectators lined the road,
inevitably bearing wine and food, and on the steepest inclines
everybody slyly gave a slight push to the riders, and the judges
never noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrary discretion is far preferable to the overt incompetence
(at best) displayed by the soccer referee, who called a hand ball
on Gregg Berhalter despite the rather basic evidence of a left hand
and a right hand dangling at Berhalter's two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Truancy rather than chicanery was the theme in Spain. The
absence of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi in Davis Cup tennis is
contrasted by nations like Sweden and Spain, where the best players
display national pride. Next time Mac should listen to his freaky
demons, and pencil himself in at doubles.
</P>
<P>
   As for track and field, the shock of two great runners both
going down was a bizarre way to call attention to the quadrennial
Olympic jubilee coming soon. With Sydney being 15 hours ahead of
New York, NBC is opting for canned events at prime time in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The network may be right, but the fact is that the Mets and the
Cubs recently came on at dawn from Japan. Soccer buffs in San
Francisco rise in the dark to watch Lazio. I got up at 6 a.m. in
Seattle to watch the Wimbledon finals. The joke was on me: it was
raining in London.
</P>
<P>
   The world grows smaller and busier. What with the boom in cable
and Internet, the old front porch is now wired.

DISEASE CONTRAL OVERSHADOWS PESTICIDE EFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The aggressive expansion of pesticide spraying in New
York this week, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's comments that some
local species, including some fish, could become casualties of war
in fighting the West Nile virus, have raised new concerns among
environmentalists that the region's fragile ecosystem could fall
victim to the anxiety over public health.
</P>
<P>
   But even the harshest critics of the spraying program concede
that there has been little conclusive evidence so far to back up
their fears.
</P>
<P>
   Like pesticide spray itself, which drifts on the wind to kill
airborne insects, then dissipates, the hints and suggestions of
broader environmental impact are impossible to pin down, the
experts say. Especially within New York City, where every species
has to confront an array of environmental assaults, from poor air
quality to polluted water, determining the relative effect of the
latest toxin in town is a difficult science.
</P>
<P>
   And with city and state resources committed first and foremost
to fighting the virus, there has also been little political
initiative to even begin such an analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a grossly inadequate effort to track the collateral
impact on the environment and on humans,'' said William Cooke, a
spokesman for the National Audubon Society in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even the few observations that have become part of the public
record are in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   State wildlife officials concluded last fall, for example, that
the city's pesticide program, then using the pesticide malathion,
was responsible for the deaths of several hundred small sun fish in
Clove Lake on Staten Island. But a raw sewage leak into the lake at
the same time made the post-mortem conclusions unclear, according
to a report by the city's Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents also reported seeing numerous dead butterflies,
bees and beetles last year during the time when the city was
spraying for mosquitoes, according to the National Audubon Society.
But without an entomological study, those deaths remained simply
unexplained observations. Butterfly populations are down again this
year, but the causes are just as unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Some pesticide experts argue that the lack of knowledge about
the long-term impact of spraying in a dense urban environment _ for
both human and nonhuman species _ is as big a story as West Nile
itself. But officials around the country who have been battling
other mosquito-borne diseases, like St. Louis encephalitis, in some
cases for decades, say that knowledge is hard won and comes only
with time.
</P>
<P>
   In Harris County, Texas, for example, which includes the city of
Houston, mosquito-control officials have assembled a 25-year
database about when and where and under what conditions of rainfall
and temperature the St. Louis virus has emerged. That has allowed
the county to concentrate its efforts and sharply reduce both
aerial and ground spraying for mature mosquitoes over time.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of pesticide use say that its effects on humans are not
being adequately explored or discussed with the public by
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Several medical studies have said, for instance, that the class
of chemicals now being used by the city, called synthetic
pyrethroids _ sold under the brand names Anvil and Scourge _ may
interfere with endocrine and immune systems in humans, according to
a report earlier this year by Environmental Advocates, based in
Albany. Chronic exposure to resmethrin, the active ingredient in
Scourge, has also been linked to effects on the human liver and
thyroid, the report said. But the Environmental Protection Agency's
lead pesticide official said those studies were not conclusive and
that the substances being used in the New York region were among
the safest on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the EPA said that the chemical used around New
York last year, malathion, posed no threat to people when used with
properly, although there was ``suggestive evidence'' that high
doses of the chemical could cause cancer in laboratory animals.
Next month, however, the agency will conduct a two-day peer review
session with independent scientists who are expected to hear
evidence from some of the agency's own researchers suggesting that
the chemical is more carcinogenic that the earlier report had
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The initial malathion review was conducted under the 1996 Food
Quality Protection Act, which required the EPA to reassess more
than 20,000 pesticides. Agency officials said that they prioritized
the work based on preliminary indications of which chemicals were
considered most toxic, and that the reassessment of the pyrethroid
group _ which includes Anvil and Scourge _ is not scheduled to
begin until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because a pesticide has a registration number with the
EPA doesn't mean it's been fully evaluated,'' said Jay Feldman,
executive director of National Coalition Against the Misuse of
Pesticides, a Washington environmental group. ``People don't know
that.''

JOSEPH ENRIGHT, 89, DIES; SANK LARGEST AIRCRAFT CARRIER IN WWII
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Capt. Joseph F. Enright, the skipper of the submarine
Archerfish, which sank the largest aircraft carrier of World War
II, a Japanese ship whose existence had been unknown to the United
States, died Thursday at his home in Fairfax, Va. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   For directing the sinking of the carrier, the Shinano, Enright,
a commander at the time, was awarded the Navy Cross, the service's
second-highest award for valor.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 9 on the evening of Nov. 28, 1944, while the
Archerfish was on surface patrol near the entrance to Tokyo Bay,
its radar picked up a ship 12 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Enright thought it was an oil tanker, but about an hour later he
realized it was an aircraft carrier escorted by three destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was the Shinano, envisioned as one of three
superbattleships, together with the Yamato and Musashi, but
converted to an aircraft carrier after Japan lost four carriers at
the Battle of Midway in June 1942.
</P>
<P>
   It displaced 59,000 tons, according to post-war American
estimates, making it the largest aircraft carrier that had ever
been built, and it had extra armor to defend against torpedoes. The
Japanese considered it to be virtually unsinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours before it was spotted by the Archerfish, the Shinano
had departed in haste from Tokyo Bay on its maiden voyage.
</P>
<P>
   Final checks on watertight doors had not been completed, and the
crew was largely inexperienced, but Japanese naval commanders
feared the carrier would be seen by American bombers, which had
begun attacks on the Japanese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The Shinano was sailing west, to Kure, where it was to undergo
finishing touches, take on fighter planes and bombers, and then
enter the Inland Sea to defend the home islands.
</P>
<P>
   The Shinano's lookout spotted the Archerfish at 10:45 p.m. Over
the next four hours, the Shinano's commander, Capt. Toshio Abe,
fearing that he was being pursued by a pack of submarines, zigged
and zagged in an effort to escape.
</P>
<P>
   But at 3:17 the next morning, the Archerfish fired six torpedoes
at the Shinano from a distance of 1,400 yards. Four torpedoes
struck the carrier.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoirs, ``Shinano! The Sinking of Japan's Secret
Supership,'' (St. Martin's Press, 1987), Enright described the
moment:
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a huge fireball erupt near the stern of the target. Then
we heard the noise of the first hit, carried to us through the
water. `Got 'em,' I yelled. As I continued to peer into the
periscope, I saw the second explosion rip the target's hull eight
seconds later. `Yahooooo!' I cried to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Archerfish, named for a freshwater fish in Australia and
Asia and with a crew of 81, dived to 400 feet, eluded 14 depth
charges from the destroyer escorts and escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The Shinano had been designed to survive perhaps 20 torpedo hits
but had been rendered vulnerable by inadequate and incomplete
construction.
</P>
<P>
   It sank at 10:55 the next morning with Captain Abe and hundreds
of sailors still aboard. The destroyer escorts picked up 1,080 of
the carrier's 2,515 sailors and civilian workers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the Shinano's sister ships survived the war. The
battleship Musashi was sunk in October 1944 and the battleship
Yamato was sunk in April 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Francis Enright was born on Sept. 18, 1910, in Minot,
N.D., and graduated from the United States Navel Academy in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few months before the sinking the Shinano, Enright seemed
destined for an undistinguished naval career.
</P>
<P>
   He had served three years aboard the battleship Maryland, then
entered the submarine service.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1943, while skipper of the submarine Dace, he
received an intelligence report giving the position, course and
speed of a Japanese aircraft carrier, the Shokaku.
</P>
<P>
   But he had been unable to maneuver his submarine to make an
attack, and had allowed the carrier to pass unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to Midway, he was so chagrined that he asked to
be relieved of his command.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy transferred him to administrative duties, and it was
not until September 1944, when he was given command of the
Archerfish, that he received a chance at redemption.
</P>
<P>
   He retired from the Navy in 1963 and then worked for the
Northrop Corp., helping to design navigational equipment.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a sister, two grandchildren and five
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1945, Enright visited Dock No. 6 at the Yokosuka Naval
Shipyard in Tokyo Bay, where the Shinano had been built.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2, 1945, Enright and his crew were present for the
final chapter of World War II. The Archerfish was among 12 American
submarines accorded the honor of standing by in Tokyo Bay as Japan
surrendered aboard the battleship Missouri. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ The Middle East peace talks collapsed Tuesday as
Israeli and Palestinian leaders failed to agree on the future of
Jerusalem despite 15 days of intense negotiations at the Camp David
summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't get there,'' President Clinton said as he
returned from the presidential retreat to the White House Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak for showing
``courage and vision'' and said that both Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat remain committed to reaching a peace agreement
by their self-imposed deadline of Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Minister Barak took some very bold decisions, but we
were, in the end, unable to bridge the gaps,'' Clinton said. ``I
think they will be bridged because I think the alternative is
unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat said in a statement with Clinton that they
would continue their efforts to reach an agreement ``as soon as
possible'' and that they understand the importance of avoiding
violence and unilateral actions.
</P>
<P>
   But at a news conference near the presidential retreat, Barak
blamed Arafat for the failed talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready to end the conflict. We looked for an
equilibrium point that will provide a peace for generations,''
Barak said. ``But unfortunately, Arafat somehow hesitated to take
the historic decisions that were needed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak said he has not lost hope that the two sides can put
an end to their 52-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision of peace suffered a major blow, but I believe that
with good faith, good will on all sides, it can recuperate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who has threatened to unilaterally declare an
independent state if no agreement is reached by the September
deadline, left the United States without issuing a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But a top aide in the talks, Saeb Erekat, told reporters that
progress had been made at the summit and that the prospects for an
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal were better now than at any time in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say the negotiations failed; I can't say the
negotiations succeeded,'' he said. But he added, ``the prospects
for a settlement are real.''
</P>
<P>
   Erekat said no one involved in the talks realistically expected
a settlement to emerge at Camp David, given the difficulty of the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   He described Arafat as ``more determined than ever'' to reach a
deal, and outline his plans to meet with Middle East and European
leaders to give them his assessments of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat's comments appeared to be aimed in part at defusing the
possibility of disturbances among Palestinians who believed that
Camp David might yield an agreement that would pave the way to
Palestinian statehood with east Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is also facing a difficult time at home from Arab
militant factions who are pressuring him to declare a Palestinian
state without waiting for a final deal with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin offered evidence of that
pressure after the talks ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only by force are we able to retain our rights. We are ready
to become martyrs, and (the Israelis) will pay a high price if they
think to attack us and reoccupy the land,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, former Primer Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went on
television, saying he wants to prevent a ``ripping apart'' of
Israeli society ``that could happen in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hear from most of the reports out of Camp David does
not answer our hopes,'' Netanyahu said. He had demanded that Barak
reject any deal calling for sharing sovereignty over Jerusalem with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced last Wednesday that the talks had
broken down, but Clinton then persuaded the two sides to negotiate
through the weekend while he attended an economic summit in
Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m. Tuesday, Arafat sent a letter to Clinton saying he saw
no point in continuing because Israel's final offer of limited
sovereignty for the Palestinians over east Jerusalem was not good
enough. Barak had already agreed to give up major portions of east
Jerusalem, but he was not willing to meet Arafat's demand that the
old walled city be placed under Palestinian control as well.

<P>
   By noon, Clinton was back in Washington. At a news conference,
he acknowledged that Jerusalem remains the major sticking point,
with both Israelis and Palestinians claiming the city as their
capital. But he said the two sides made ``significant progress'' on
several other core issues and had discussed some questions that had
previously been considered off limits.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the issue of Jerusalem, he said, the two sides did not
have a great deal of disagreement over how people would live if
they are able to reach a settlement. He cited as an example the
fact that everyone concedes both Israelis and Palestinians should
have access to Jerusalem's holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emphasized that Arafat and the whole Palestinian team
worked hard, but he credited Barak with deeper concessions,
particularly on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians changed their position. They moved forward,''
Clinton said. ``The Israelis moved more from the position they
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak ``came here knowing that he was going to have to take bold
steps, and he did it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be making a mistake not to praise Barak,'' he added,
``because I think he took a big risk, and I think it sparked
already in Israel public opinion toward the conditions that will
make peace.'' The people of Israel, he said, ``should be very proud
of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The president likened the summit to ``going to the dentist
without having your gums deadened.'' But said in comparison to
other peace negotiations he has participated in _ particularly
those involving Bosnia, Kosovo and Ireland _ the Palestinians and
Israelis were better able to work through several difficult issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that in previous peace negotiations he was dealing
with people who often wouldn't shake hands, let alone speak to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me give you some good news: Of all the peace groups I've
ever worked with, these people know each other, they know the names
of each other's children, they know how many grandchildren the
grandparents have, they know their life stories, they have a
genuine respect and understanding for each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the United States should be prepared to make a
``significant'' financial contribution to the peace process,
especially to help resettle refugees. While in Okinawa, he called
on Group of Eight leaders to contribute as well. &QL;

YOUNG GUNS OF DUBAI TO TRY DEL MAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR _ The trainer doesn't have a winner to his name. All of
his horses are maidens.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Eoin Harty's barn _ barn K, on the backstretch near the
five- eighths-mile pole _ will be one to watch during the Del Mar
thoroughbred racing season that opens this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Harty (whose first name is pronounced ``Owen'') is here with a
string of 2-year-olds owned by Godolphin Racing Inc., the Dubai
sheikhs' powerful worldwide stable. Godolphin has nominated 15
colts for the meet- ending Del Mar Futurity on Sept. 13 and five
fillies for the Del Mar Debutante on Sept. 2. Up to a dozen others
are expected to run under the royal-blue Godolphin silks during the
43-day meet.
</P>
<P>
   Harty, a 37-year-old Irishman, proved his skill with young
horses as an assistant to Bob Baffert, winner of the past three Del
Mar training titles and the past four runnings of the Del Mar
Futurity (the first with Silver Charm on the way to his 1997
Kentucky Derby victory). Harty was hired away last fall to be the
trainer in Godolphin's ``American Project,'' racing the sheikhs'
2-year-olds in the United States before the best of them return to
the United Arab Emirates next winter to prepare for the Triple
Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those horses went winless in six starts at the
recent Hollywood Park meet after training across town at Santa
Anita. Now the Harty barn faces a fuller test at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be very disappointed if he's not very strong,'' said Jim
Pegram, agent for David Flores, Del Mar's champion jockey of 1999
and Harty's main rider here. ``He's got a bunch of very, very nice
2-year-olds. He's brought them along slower than he did when he was
with Baffert. The ones that did race over at Hollywood Park needed
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch the development as these horses run. He had a couple
that ran good at Hollywood, but he also had a few who ran poorly.
You figure they were at a disadvantage running there after training
at Santa Anita. They should do better at Del Mar.''
</P>
<P>
   Harty entered two colts in the 6-furlong seventh race on the
nine-race opening-day card. Dubai Breeze, a chestnut son of
Woodman, makes his second start under Flores after rallying
strongly to finish fourth in a 5-furlong race at Hollywood. Matta,
by Unaccounted For, debuts under Eddie Delahoussaye.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more anticipated Godolphin 2-year-olds: Dubai Vision,
a half-brother of the top European horse Dubai Millennium; and
Dubai to Dubai, half-brother to 1999 European 2-year-old champion
Fasliyev.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging 2-year-olds are always big news in the summer. But
the stars of the future might get more attention at Del Mar this
time because so few stars of the present are here.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 27 horses receiving votes in this week's National
Thoroughbred Racing Association poll, only three are pointing for
races at Del Mar: General Challenge, the 1999 Pacific Classic
winner, aims for a repeat in the $1 million race Aug. 26; Early
Pioneer, upsetter of General Challenge in the Hollywood Gold Cup,
girds for a rematch, and Riboletta, California's leading mare, is
shooting for the Clement Hirsch Handicap (formerly the Chula Vista)
Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   First post today is 2 p.m. The featured Oceanside Stakes, a mile
turf race for 3-year-olds, will be run in $75,000 divisions as the
fifth and eighth races.

AT FARNBOROUGH, BOEING SAYS IT IS ADOPTING KEY FEATURE FROM
LOCKHEED DESIGN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DAN PILLER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARNBOROUGH, England _ As Lockheed Martin and Boeing compete for
what could be the last major U.S. fighter contract in the next four
decades, Boeing complimented Lockheed while the companies traded
barbs.
</P>
<P>
   In their proposed design for the joint strike fighter, and to
the surprise of aerospace observers at the international
Farnborough Air Show, Boeing has copied a key feature on Lockheed's
JSF entry.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing JSF chief Frank Statkus told reporters at the show
Tuesday that about 20 percent of the downward thrust on the
vertical lift for Boeing's fighter will come from so-called cold
thrust, or nonjet gas.
</P>
<P>
   That represents a change from Boeing's original plan to copy the
British Harrier military aircraft, using downward-pointed hot jet
nozzles for the vertical takeoff and landing that the new jet
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Since Boeing and Lockheed Martin won the semifinal competition
for the 3,000-plane, $200 billion JSF contract almost four years
ago, Lockheed Martin has touted its system that throws cold air,
rather than exhaust, downward as the fighter hovers above the
ground. The cold air is considered less likely to come back up and
burn up the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin's proponents had said Boeing's design would
handicap Boeing in the final contest for the award, which the
Pentagon will make next year.
</P>
<P>
   But Statkus said Boeing didn't copy Lockheed's design. He
acknowledged that the cold thrust nozzle wasn't in Boeing's
original design, but he noted that 80 percent of the downward
thrust from the Boeing JSF design still will come from jet gas.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden appearance of one cold jet nozzle in the Boeing JSF
design surprised aerospace observers. But Frank Cappuccio, Lockheed
Martin's JSF director, declined to gloat, saying he hadn't heard of
Boeing's change.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least, they are working on the problem,'' Cappuccio said.
</P>
<P>
   The JSF will be used by the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines,
and the British Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy. It will be the
last major fighter contract until 2040 under Pentagon plans.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it is considered a key to corporate success for
Lockheed and Boeing, particularly for the Fort Worth plant that
will build the airplane if Lockheed wins the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are readying the first flights of their JSF
demonstrator models, which are being assembled in California.
Lockheed Martin Vice President Tom Burbage said he believes that
his company's plane will make its first flight before the summer's
end.
</P>
<P>
   Statkus promised a flight within three weeks, but he later
hedged, saying, ``I never like to give a specific date.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, both companies will fly their conventional versions,
without the vertical lift. The vertical lift versions will be flown
later this year or early next.
</P>
<P>
   With no JSFs to put on view at the worldwide air show in
Farnborough, both companies assembled mockups of their designs and
held briefings to tout their progress.
</P>
<P>
   Dain Hancock, president of the Fort Worth-based Lockheed Martin
Aeronautics Co., which runs the local plant, said his plane ``is
very close to the final proposal that we will make, and that's
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock said too many changes have weakened the Boeing design.
</P>
<P>
   Statkus said the Pentagon's directives to the two companies
``never said that the plane designs had to be consistent. The
design simply has to be affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon guidelines call for a price of $30 million per plane
for the conventional version and $39 million for the vertical lift
version to be used by the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing hasn't built a fighter for the military since before
World War II, focusing instead on bombers and its successful
commercial airliner business. Lockheed Martin, by contrast, has a
history of fighter building going back to World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But Statkus said Lockheed Martin's long fighter history doesn't
give it a leg up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to this competition than just saying we've built
planes before and we'll do it again,'' Statkus said. ``Boeing has
reinvented the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The aerospace industry has buzzed for almost four years about
Lockheed Martin's unusual vertical lift design, saying that the
cold air thrust was admirable but that the technology had not been
tested and could be expensive. Lockheed Martin acknowledged to a
defense publication that it had to make design changes as recently
as last month because of problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Cappuccio said Lockheed Martin has successfully tested the
crucial change from forward to vertical thrust ``more than 50 times
in the last two weeks without a failure.''

MAN ARRESTED IN BRICK ATTACK MAY HAVE ALIBI ON VIDEOTAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A homeless man who had been accused of smashing a
woman on the head with a chunk of concrete was ordered released on
Tuesday after prosecutors said that new evidence may exonerate him.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Bently Louis Grant, 35, has spent the last week in a
mental health clinic at the Rikers Island Detention Complex, and
was expected to be released Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sources involved in the investigation said Tuesday that security
videotapes taken from a Virgin Records store in Manhattan may
provide Grant with an alibi, showing that he was at the store when
the attack took place.
</P>
<P>
   The police said last week that they had strong evidence that
Grant attacked Tiffany F. Goldberg on July 9 on a Manhattan street
soon after she left a church. Investigators said their evidence
included three witnesses and a confession that the police said
Grant made during 20 hours of grilling at a precinct house.
</P>
<P>
   After prosecutors presented the new information in court
Tuesday, Justice John P. Walsh of Manhattan State Supreme Court
granted their request that Grant be released.
</P>
<P>
   While Grant remains a suspect, his release would suggest that
whoever attacked Goldberg is still at large. The attack was one of
the most highly publicized crimes in the city this year, and it
recalled a similar n assault in midtown Manhattan last fall in
which on another woman, Nicole Barrett, last fall. had her skull
smashed by a man wielding a paving stone.
</P>
<P>
   After Goldberg was attacked, the police carried out an intense
hunt for the assailant, finally arresting Grant last week.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing Tuesday's developments, the Manhattan district
attorney released a statement saying prosecutors ``have discovered
new evidence that raises substantial questions about Grant's
identity as the perpetrator of the crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   A Police Department spokesman, Assistant Chief Thomas P. Fahey,
said Tuesday, ``We're after the truth, wherever it may take us.''
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Lapiner-Giresi, Grant's court-appointed lawyer said that
she was perturbed by Grant's confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he did not hit Tiffany Goldberg on the head with a
rock, and anything he said about it is because he was questioned
for 20 hours,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant has no previous criminal record and kept to himself,
earning a living by recycling cans. Last week, when Police
Commissioner Howard Safir was asked whether Grant had a history of
mental problems, he said, ``Normal people do not hit people over
the head with concrete.''

REMEMBERING LENNY: P-I WRITER LIVED LIFE WITH GRACE, CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Among the human virtues that have fallen out of favor
these days is grace. So much so, I'm not sure I know what it is
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Except when I see it. Lenny Anderson was grace.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was without noise, odd hair or entourage, he was not a
contemporary happening. The man didn't even have his own cable-TV
show or Web site, fergawdsakes.
</P>
<P>
   But for multiple generations of Seattle newspaper readers, as
well as multiple generations of Seattle sportswriters, Lenny was a
figure of delight and respect. Lenny was grace in a felt fedora.
</P>
<P>
   His passing on Sunday at age 79 will not make a splash with
those who did not know him personally, because he didn't sell
himself beyond himself. For those of us privileged to know him over
his 53 years in newspapering, his death is a cold wave of missed
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his example, which was in front of us here at the P-I
from 1964 to his retirement in 1996, none of us ever quite managed
to distill and emulate what it was that created such effortless
charm.
</P>
<P>
   As a writing rule, I avoid the use of the word ``nice'' because
it is so hackneyed and non-descriptive. But neither the computer
thesaurus nor the reading public is ready to accept ``lenny'' as an
alternative adjective. Pity.
</P>
<P>
   Said longtime friend and sports PR man Bill Sears: ``No kinder,
gentler man ever walked the face of the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   How, in a business where irony and sarcasm are the primary modes
of conversation, could he stay so sincere?
</P>
<P>
   When he asked, ``How are you?'' he wasn't being gratuitous. He
really wanted to know about your life and times. And if things
weren't so good, he would offer to help fix things. If you weren't
careful, he just might.
</P>
<P>
   A few summers ago, I burst into the sports department in a panic
after my car, parked in its familiar expired-time spot, finally was
towed by the cackling constables just before I had to pick up my
wife and in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   My colleagues who weren't laughing were slinking out of the
office. Lenny practically leaped out of his chair to offer me the
use of his car. In my desperation, I said yes, forgetting that
Lenny drove a vintage Lincoln Continental that was operated not
from the driver's seat but a flying bridge.
</P>
<P>
   As I pulled up _ rather, docked _ a look of astonishment swept
over the family's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask,'' I said. ``If it weren't for my stupidity and one
guy's generosity, you'd be walking. Just get in and leave me
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   We spent the evening searching for my car and attempting to
parallel park Lenny's beast. When I finally returned his keys,
exhausted, he gave the quintessential Lenny response:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need it for the weekend, please keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, we're good to go, Lenny, thanks anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny's fundamental goodness was endearing to sports figures as
well. Much of the prime of his sportswriting career came when
Seattle was attempting to become a major league sports city. He was
the P-I's baseball beat writer in 1969, the lone year of the
Pilots, when he befriended the club's owner and local civic hero,
Dewey Soriano.
</P>
<P>
   But it was on Lenny's watch that Soriano, beset by debt and
pressure from baseball owners, pulled the most ghastly local sports
deed of the last century _ selling the Pilots after spring training
to a Milwaukee used car dealer named Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very trying time for Lenny,'' said Sears, who worked
for the Pilots. ``He was close to Dewey, as were many in the press.
But even though he felt great empathy, he had to report the bad
news. I gained tremendous respect for him then. He knew what he had
to do, and did it without making Soriano an ogre and fracturing the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   While others were reporting that the threat to the Pilots was
overblown, Lenny broke a story in early March, 1970, that said
owners were conspiring to pull the plug in Seattle. The headline:
``Seattle Could Still Lose Pilots, P-I Writer Says.''
</P>
<P>
   The editors knew if Lenny put out the story, it was true and the
town had better believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was hard news or a soft feature, Lenny's wordsmithing
was of a rare standard. Humor, poignance, creativity, elegance,
affection for language _ if he were a modern baseball player, he'd
be called a five-tool guy.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, when he took on copy-desk work, Lenny would hear
his deskmates with young families talking about the hassles of
holiday night shifts. As readily as he would lend his car, Lenny
would volunteer to swap shifts. Sometimes, he didn't get paid back.
Never did he say anything.
</P>
<P>
   Said former P-I sports editor Bill Knight: ``As far as I can
remember, Lenny never said a bad word about anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to spot Lenny in a media crowd, because he dressed
so nattily _ jacket, vest and tie, felt hat in winter, straw hat in
summer. There was no mistaking the words, either _ a wry, dry wit
delivered in a slow rasp.
</P>
<P>
   But the superficial was secondary to the special: A grace that
gave joy to all it touched.

TEXAS STUDENTS SCORE HIGH ON NATIONAL TESTS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MELANIE MARKLEY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Texas students, building on reforms launched in the
1980s, outperformed peers with similar backgrounds on national
tests measuring education progress, California-based researchers
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller class sizes, well-funded preschool programs and adequate
resources for teachers are key factors that separate top-ranked
Texas from the likes of California, which came in last among 44
states participating in the three-year private study, Rand found.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you compare the scores of students from similar families,
Texas does very well with respect to other states,'' said David
Grissmer, lead researcher in the Rand study.
</P>
<P>
   Based on an analysis of the National Assessment of Educational
Progress tests given from 1990 to 1996, the study ranks states by
raw scores, scores that compare students with similar backgrounds
and score improvements.
</P>
<P>
   When comparing raw scores, Texas ranks below most other states.
Maine, North Dakota, Iowa, New Hampshire and Montana are at the
top, while Mississippi, Louisiana, California, Alabama and South
Carolina are at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said the states with high raw scores tend to have
fewer minorities, higher family incomes and better-educated
parents.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas ranked second only to North Carolina in improved
scores _ about twice as great as the national average _ and
outperformed all other states when variations in demographics were
taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded by ExxonMobil's education foundation, the
St. Louis-based Danforth Foundation, divisions of the U.S.
Department of Education and Rand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rand report confirms what those of us in Texas have known
for many years _ that Texas is at the forefront in education
reform, leading the nation in achievement gains among minority
students and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds,'' Texas
Education Commissioner Jim Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was championed by the major presidential contenders,
George W. Bush and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud of the results we have achieved in education in
Texas,'' Bush said from Austin. ``As president, I will achieve the
same results, ensuring that no child is left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Douglas Hattaway said the factors
highlighted for improving achievement _ small class size, preschool
and more resources for teachers _ are all central issues in Gore's
education agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report confirms that Al Gore has the right priorities to
help improve our public schools,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the study found that higher teacher salaries,
higher teacher educational levels and increased experience in
teaching do not show significant effects on achievement.
</P>
<P>
   But Grissmer said because of the growing teacher shortage, he
believes salaries will play a larger role in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, it's hard for Bush to take full credit for the
educational reforms that researchers said are making a difference.
Grissmer noted, however, that the governor has continued the
reforms and provided new resources to support them.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller class sizes and the emphasis on preschool were key
elements of a sweeping education reform law approved by the Texas
Legislature in a 1984 special session.
</P>
<P>
   A commission spearheaded by Dallas businessman and former Reform
Party presidential candidate H. Ross Perot recommended the changes,
and former Gov. Mark White, a Democrat, pushed legislation to
support them.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Luce, a Republican who was general counsel of Perot's
commission, said the reforms have been sustained through the years
because of strong bipartisan support and the backing of the
business community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the Perot commission in 1984 gave us a good start,
but all that work really has been continued and propelled along by
Gov. Bush and a whole lot of other people,'' Luce said.
</P>
<P>
   White said that he, former Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby and former
Speaker of the House Gib Lewis fought to raise taxes to pay for the
reforms during difficult economic times.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with a strong economy, White said the state should do
more to raise the educational level even higher and to compete with
the states at the top of the scale in raw scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, averages and that sort of thing that show us
doing quite well when you take out the socioeconomical
differentials really kind of beg the question,'' White said. ``We
are not really doing as well as we should. Now that we've got good
times, why don't we do better?''
</P>
<P>
   The study in particular compares Texas to California. While the
states have similar student demographics, Texas students on average
scored 11 percentage points higher on NAEP math and reading tests
than their California counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Stone, spokesman for the California Department of
Education, said major reforms, including reduced class sizes and an
accountability system, were adopted after the study, which focused
on national test scores through 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has a long way to go, but the seeds have been
planted for what we believe will be many years of continued
academic achievement among most of our students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone believes the study accurately reflects the status
of education in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think NAEP scores give a broad enough view of what is
happening in the schools,'' said Al Kauffman, attorney for the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman said Texas schools have improved over the past 10 or 12
years, largely because of more equalized funding and smaller class
sizes.
</P>
<P>
   But he and others have begun raising questions about the use of
high-stakes standardized tests when measuring educational progress.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, in particular, has been at the forefront of a national
movement to rate schools and promote students on the basis of test
scores.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Haynes, professor of education at Boston College, said a
study he is completing shows that test scores don't tell the whole
story.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes' research shows a high percentage of Texas students,
especially minorities, drop out of high school every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that it's quite implausible to claim that Texas
is doing good work in educating its minorities if you've got 35 and
40 percent dropping out of school before high school graduation,''
said Haynes, who is also a senior research associate in Boston
College's Center for the Study of Testing.
</P>
<P>
   Linda McNeil, co-director of Rice University's Center for
Education, said the Rand study does not address the fact that every
year, 67,000 Texas students drop out of school and 30 percent of
the graduates need remediation before they can start freshmen
classes in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rand numbers could easily distract people from dealing
with the really serious problems that remain in the schools, and by
many other sources of data, are only getting worse,'' she said. &QL;

BUSH PICKS CHENEY AS RUNNING MATE 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Washington insider Dick Cheney, who once told George W.
Bush he didn't want the job, agreed Tuesday to be Bush's running
mate, vowing to help ``restore a spirit of civility and respect and
cooperation'' to the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Bush introduced Cheney, a former congressman and secretary of
defense, to a few hundred flag-waving supporters and a horde of
media as a ``distinguished and experienced statesman'' who is
well-respected by Republicans and Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked him because he is, without a doubt, fully capable of
being the president of the United States, and I picked him because
he will be a valuable partner in a Bush administration,'' said the
governor, who will claim the Republican presidential nomination
next week at the party's national convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign released physicians' statements supporting the
governor's assurances that Cheney, 59, who has a history of heart
trouble, was now healthy enough to be one heartbeat away from the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, noted that Cheney was
working out on a treadmill at his Dallas home when Bush called
early Tuesday morning to offer him the No. 2 spot on the Republican
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Despite spending much of his own career in Washington, Cheney
spoke like an outsider when he predicted that ``big changes are
coming to Washington, and I want to be a part of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for America's leaders to stop pointing the finger of
blame and to begin sharing the credit for success,'' he said,
echoing Bush's frequent call for more bipartisan cooperation in the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's strong anti-abortion record and conservative
credentials, some political analysts believed, made him a safe
choice for Bush among the Republican Party's conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, in an appearance on Larry King Live on CNN,
Cheney said he could agree with Bush's anti-abortion stance, which
would allow exceptions for the procedure to be performed in cases
of rape or incest, or to protect the life of the mother. While in
Congress, Cheney had generally adopted a position that allowed no
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also has been criticized for voting, while in Congress in
the 1980s, against the Head Start Program, a federal program
boosting educational opportunities for poor children. Cheney said
he has a different view of the program now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not vote against Head Start today,'' he said. He
explained that many of his votes in the 1980s were designed to cut
spending and reduce the federal deficit. He said today's strong
economy better enables government to consider more of the
``compassionate'' programs Bush favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's choice of Dick Cheney to be his
vice-presidential running mate is great news for Republicans all
across the nation,'' said Susan Weddington, chairman of the Texas
Republican Party, whose leadership is strongly influenced by social
and religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   American Conservative Union Chairman David A. Keene called
Cheney the ``absolute best choice Bush could possibly make.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who was widely reported over the weekend to be Bush's
first choice for vice president, was scheduled to join Bush today
on a quick campaign trip to sparsely populated Wyoming, where
Cheney grew up and which he represented in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and campaign aides publicly revealed for the first time
that Bush had asked Cheney in March whether he would consider being
a vice-presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney had been secretary of defense under Bush's father, former
President Bush, and for several months had advised the Texas
governor on his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said he declined the first invitation because, ``I was
deeply involved in running a business, enjoying private life, and I
certainly wasn't looking to return to public service.''
</P>
<P>
   After returning to private life, Cheney became chairman of the
board and CEO of the Halliburton Co. in Dallas, a position from
which he will now resign.
</P>
<P>
   On April 25, Bush asked Cheney to head his vice-presidential
selection process but said he kept the thought of Cheney actually
being his running mate ``in the back of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush asked Cheney again about taking the No. 2 spot on the GOP
ticket over the Fourth of July weekend while the two were at Bush's
ranch near Crawford. That time, Cheney said he was willing to talk
with his family about the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said he changed his mind after hearing Bush talk ``about
his unique vision for our party and for our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw his sincerity. I watched him make decisions, always firm
and always fair, and in the end, I learned how persuasive he can
be,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor Cheney took reporters' questions during their
announcement event, which took no more than 15 minutes, in the
Burnt Orange Room of the Frank C. Erwin Center on the University of
Texas at Austin campus.
</P>
<P>
   But Hughes later said that the two men's working relationship
had deepened over the months.
</P>
<P>
   She said 20-30 potential running mates were proposed to Bush but
said she didn't know how many actually were screened. She confirmed
that Bush had met with Govs. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, George
Pataki of New York and John Engler of Michigan and former U.S. Sen.
John Danforth of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Cheney also fulfilled his initial role and gave Bush
a list of alternative running mates, other than himself. But Hughes
said Bush had asked that the other names not be released. Hughes
said Bush occasionally asked his father what he thought of some
potential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cheney, who is five years older than Bush, has had
three heart attacks and one bypass operation, the Bush campaign
released a statement from Cheney's personal physician, Dr. Gary
Malakoff of George Washington Medical Center, that Cheney is in
``excellent health.''
</P>
<P>
   But Malakoff reported that Cheney has a long history of high
cholesterol, which has been successfully treated with medication;
has been treated for skin cancer; has had several minor episodes of
gout of the foot; and takes a ``long list of medications.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has shown no side effects of any of these medications which
would alter intellectual performance or impair his judgment,''
Malakoff wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Another Cheney physician, heart specialist Jonathan S. Reiner of
the George Washington University Medical Center, said Cheney
``travels extensively for work, exercises 30 minutes per day
several days per week on a treadmill and engages in vigorous
recreational activities such as hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign said that it was satisfied that Cheney's
background has been thoroughly investigated by the FBI over the
years. In addition to serving in Congress and as secretary of
defense _ including during the Persian Gulf War _ Cheney was White
House chief of staff under President Ford and served in the Nixon
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush reviewed Cheney's personal financial
information for potential conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was born in Lincoln, Neb., on Jan. 30, 1941, grew up in
Casper, Wyo., and is a graduate of the University of Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   He is married to his high school sweetheart, the former Lynne
Ann Vincent. They have two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Cheney told her that, after taking Bush's call at
6:22 a.m. Tuesday, he hung up the phone and said to his wife,
``Honey, sell the house. I'm quitting my job; we're going back into
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign even dredged up some old compliments of Cheney
from Vice President Al Gore, the probable Democratic presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good guy. I like him a lot, and he is well liked by
his colleagues,'' Gore was quoted by the Boston Globe in March
1989, when Gore was in the Senate and Cheney was undergoing
confirmation hearings for his defense appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The only slightly awkward moment in the running-mate
announcement occurred when Bush asked the audience to bow their
heads for a few moments in silent memory of Tuesday's Concorde
jetliner crash in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``May God bless their families,'' he said, before abruptly
adding, ``Now, on a happier note, I believe you're looking at the
next vice president of the United States.'' &QL;

Keeping up with Galloway's speed is Aikman' pleasant problem 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Los Angeles Lakers needed to get the
ball into the hands of Shaquille O'Neal to win a world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes Joey Galloway, the Cowboys' version of Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the best way to get the ball into Galloway's big hands
and long arms is a significant part of two-a-day practices at
Midwestern State University, where the Cowboys train.
</P>
<P>
   The $12.5 million signing bonus, the $42 million total contract
and the two first-round draft choices sent to Seattle in February
ultimately will be worth it _ or not worth it _ depending on the
frequency that Troy Aikman and Galloway connect this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey has made it clear to me that I can't overthrow him,''
Aikman said. ``So, the first time I do it, write about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman is serious about needing to get the ball far enough in
front of Galloway, even though they have had several months of
off-season and training-camp work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just figure I'm going to start throwing it as far as I
can,'' said Aikman, who is entering his 12th season with the
Cowboys. ``I've got about 55 yards left in my arm.''
</P>
<P>
   During workouts], the deep routes involving either Galloway or
speed-mate Rocket Ismail require Aikman to put a lot of air
underneath the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that makes it worse,'' Aikman acknowledged with a wry
smile, ``because then I get only about 48 yards out of my arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposing NFL defensive coordinators are expected to toss and
turn at night trying to devise methods to stop the Cowboys without
burning double teams on two receivers who are faster than most of
the fastest cornerbacks in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know which one is faster,'' Aikman said of the
Galloway-Ismail comparison. ``I would guess that Joey is, but he's
``deceptively'' faster. He doesn't look like he's moving as quick
as Rocket is when they're running. So, for me, it has taken a
little bit of getting used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway said he isn't concerned about Aikman's arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be ones that I don't get to and some others
that he underthrows,'' said the three-time 1,000-yard receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones beat Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder
to the punch in obtaining Galloway. Jones had heard all the stories
about Galloway being a ``freak of nature,'' but needed to see him
in person to believe such a disproportionate foot size (12 1/2) for
a man who is 5-foot-11, 188 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys wide receiver James McKnight, a teammate of Galloway's
in Seattle, said Galloway received a ``bad rap'' for being timid
about going across the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, however, questions Galloway's elusiveness underneath on
the quick outs or his straight-away speed on the go-routes.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Zampese, the Cowboys' offensive consultant who spent the
past two seasons at New England, said, ``Terry Glenn and Shawn
Jefferson are fast, but they're not Joey Galloway fast. I've had
Terry Glenn tell me, `I'll go up against anybody, but I can't beat
Galloway.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Patterson, the Cowboys' defensive tackles coach who came
from the Minnesota Vikings, said, ``Joey Galloway is the fastest
human being in shoulder pads that I've ever seen, and I saw Randy
Moss.''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway, Ismail and Aikman can be seen talking frequently in
camp about routes and adjustments on the ball. Communication is
paramount. Aikman and Ismail have had a full season together,
providing a comfort zone for the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the \RGalloway-Ismail\S gap is closing,'' Cowboys
coach Dave Campo said at the conclusion of practice yesterday. ``As
you know, this offense is different than last year's, so Joey and
Rocket are both working \Rto find\S where they need to be and when
they need to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Campo's main concerns in this camp has been dropped balls
_ by all receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our routes are timing-based,'' Campo said, ``so getting out of
those cuts \Raffects\S how the ball is thrown and where it's
thrown. Still, too many drops for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a dropped ball is the only way Galloway or Ismail can
be stopped.

INJURED PUDGE MIGHT FEEL RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We gathered in the little alcove outside the basement elevator
Monday night at The Ballpark in Arlington, maybe two dozen members
of the media from Texas and Southern California, waiting for Pudge
Rodriguez to come and say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   He had just returned from the hospital, where X-rays of his
right thumb confirmed that it had been broken in a first-inning
collision with Mo Vaughn's bat, and the Rangers' efficient PR
machine had graciously summoned us for the last rites.
</P>
<P>
   We already knew the worst by then, of course. Surgery would be
performed on the thumb yesterday afternoon at the Fort Worth
Surgery Center. Pins would hold the fracture together during a
healing period of six to 10 weeks. God willing, he'll again be the
old Pudge we've known and loved in three to five months.
</P>
<P>
   But all that was just medical jargon. It didn't deal with the
tragedy involved, not for the Rangers, who lost their best player,
and certainly not for Rodriguez, who was having yet another career
season.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was on his way to phenomenal numbers, particularly for
a catcher. Better numbers than last season, when he was the
league's MVP. Mike Piazza-like numbers. Johnny Bench numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, we expected dejection; bitter disappointment; sadness at
the loss of what might have been; perhaps even a flare of anger at
this unfair turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   What we got, I think, was relief.
</P>
<P>
   The man who stepped out of the trainer's room door, 8-year-old
son Dereck by his side, wasn't dejected. He showed little or no
disappointment or sadness. He wasn't a bit angry or ruffled.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed, well, almost relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Like maybe he wasn't all that unhappy to be leaving this
miserable wreck of a Rangers' season behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team's not going good for a year, a lot of bad things
happen,'' he shrugged matter-of-factly. ``I'll rest it and start
the rehab when they tell me to, and be ready for next spring
training.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pudge, I ventured (sounding very much like a man who had
just lost the heart and soul of his fantasy baseball team), what
about this wonderful career-year you were having? Doesn't it hurt
to see it end so abruptly?
</P>
<P>
   (It was darn sure hurting me.)
</P>
<P>
   Before he was hurt Monday night, Rodriguez was ranked in the top
10 in the American League in batting (.347), home runs (27), RBI
(83), hits (126), total bases (242), slugging percentage (.667) and
doubles (27).
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, he said in so many words.
</P>
<P>
   As owner-GM of the Amon Carter League's Blue Pigs, I wanted to
reach out and slap some sense into him. As a well-seasoned sports
writer, I restrained myself, not wanting to embarrass him in front
of his young son.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always next season,'' he said. ``I have a really,
really strong mind, and this is not going to affect me.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a man with the ultimate confidence that he can pick
up right where he left off next spring. Or by a man who knows all
too well where this season was headed and one who would just as
soon not be directly involved in the pileup.
</P>
<P>
   This is not meant to be unfair to Rodriguez who, after all, is
on the disabled list for only the second time in his 10-year
career. He's a gamer. It's as simple as that. Sure, he has some
thespian in him. He has been known to squeeze extra camera time out
of the various nicks and bruises that a catcher incurs during a
season.
</P>
<P>
   But all you need to know about Rodriguez is that when a
backswing from a bat broke his jaw a couple of years ago, he missed
only one game. He is absolutely no malingerer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happens when you play hard,'' he said of Monday
night's accident. ``I was throwing the ball hard, like I always do,
throwing the ball hard to second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the half-season I had so far, but there's
always next year. Next year I'm going to come back strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Implied in Rodriguez's statement is the hope that the Rangers,
too, will come back strong after what has been a disappointing and
broken season.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Rafael Palmeiro both went on record from Seattle
over the weekend, urging the Rangers to seriously consider
re-signing free-agent-to-be Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, or a hitter like him, might supply an answer to part
of the problem, but certainly not all of it. Gonzalez can't fill
three spots in the rotation. He can't close games if the Rangers
trade John Wetteland. He's not the answer for improved defense or
for a team needing to hit into about half as many double plays as
this one does.
</P>
<P>
   What the Rangers must do in the second half of the season is
find solutions to as many of those problems as possible. They've
made a commitment to young pitchers Ryan Glynn, Matt Perisho and
Doug Davis, and that's good. Put them out there and see what they
can do.
</P>
<P>
   They'll take their lumps, as they did in Seattle over the
weekend, but that's the same thing that the White Sox did a couple
of years ago with young starters Mike Sirotka and Jim Parque. Now
those pitchers have helped lead the White Sox to the best record in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Will Darren Oliver do anything to earn the $12 million the
Rangers must pay him over the next two years? Will Gabe Kapler hit
enough to hold onto a starting position? How can they improve their
infield defense? Will Royce Clayton ever smile again?
</P>
<P>
   Tough questions. The Rangers will spend the rest of this lost
season entangled in the painful process of digging for answers.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder a broken thumb and a three-month rest might seem like
a reprieve.

EXCERPTS FROM STATEMENTS BY BUSH AND CHENEY  

</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the announcement Tuesday by Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas and Dick Cheney that Cheney would be Bush's
running mate, as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Statement by Bush  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the vice-presidential selection process my foremost
goal has been to select an outstanding individual who is capable of
serving as president of the United States. I wanted the selection
process to be thorough and dignified. I reached out to a
distinguished and experienced statesman to lead the search.
</P>
<P>
   For months we worked closely together to review the
qualifications of many impressive candidates. As we worked to
evaluate the strength of others I saw firsthand Dick Cheney's
outstanding judgment. As we considered many different credentials I
benefited from his keen insight. I was impressed by the thoughtful
and thorough way he approached his mission. And gradually I
realized that the person who was best qualified to be my
vice-presidential nominee was working by my side.
</P>
<P>
   Before I asked Dick Cheney to chair the selection process, I had
asked him whether he would consider being a candidate himself. At
the time he said no. He had a challenging and demanding job with a
worldwide company and he was enjoying the private sector. But I
kept the thought of him joining me in the back of my mind.
</P>
<P>
   When Secretary Cheney visited me and Laura at our ranch in
Crawford, Texas, over the last Fourth of July weekend, we reviewed
many candidates, all of whom are very impressive. But I continued
to believe the best candidate might be sitting next to me. I asked
him again whether he'd be willing to join me to accomplish some
great goals for our country: to save and strengthen Social
Security; to improve Medicare and provide prescription drugs for
the elderly; to reform our public schools; and to rebuild our
military to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   This time he said he was willing to talk with his family and
consider it.
</P>
<P>
   Early this morning I called and asked him to join me in renewing
America's purpose together. So I'm proud to announce that Dick
Cheney, a man of great integrity, sound judgment and experience, is
my choice to be the next vice president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot wait for our delegates at our convention next week to
hear from this good man, and I ask them to confirm him as our
party's choice for vice president. The fact that this outstanding
man is willing to serve speaks to the power of our compassionate
conservative message and to the promise of our country.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit something. I didn't pick Dick Cheney because of
Wyoming's three electoral votes, although we're going to work hard
to earn them. I picked him because he is without a doubt fully
capable of being the president of the United States. And I picked
him because he will be a valuable partner in a Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney has served our country as chief of staff to a
president, served in the United States Congress and as secretary of
defense. He's a man of integrity who is respected by Republicans
and Democrats. Even my opponent, the vice president, once said Dick
Cheney is a good man who is well liked and respected by his
colleagues, and I agree. I'm proud to call him my friend and
honored to call him my running mate.
</P>
<P>
   And I'd also like you to welcome Lynne Cheney. She's a woman of
many accomplishments; she's a smart woman, capable woman. She
served as chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities. And
she is a leader in education reform all across America, is
developing high standards and a sound curriculum for our public
schools. Lynne is an incredibly important member of this team as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Laura and I are honored to have Dick and Lynne Cheney by our
side. We look forward to winning and holding out the American
promise for every citizen. ...
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Statement by Cheney  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Well, this is obviously a very special moment for Lynne and me.
Three months ago, when Governor Bush asked me to head up his search
team I honestly did not expect that I would be standing here today.
</P>
<P>
   Governor, I'm honored and proud to join your team and I
enthusiastically accept the challenge for this reason: I believe
you have the vision and the courage to be a great president. And I
want to do absolutely everything I can to make certain that
happens.
</P>
<P>
   When the governor first asked whether or not I would consider
being a candidate, I respectfully declined. I was deeply involved
in running a business, enjoying private life, and I certainly
wasn't looking to return to public service. But I had an experience
that changed my mind this spring. As I worked alongside Governor
Bush I heard him talk about his unique vision for our party and for
our nation. I saw his sincerity, I watched him make decisions,
always firm and always fair. And in the end, I learned how
persuasive he can be. So this morning when the governor called and
asked me to join him as the vice-presidential nominee, I accepted
with enthusiasm. ...
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush is seeking not only to win an election, but also
to lead our nation. He's confronting the tough issues:
strengthening Social Security and Medicare, reforming our public
schools, cutting taxes and rebuilding America's military. He's
shown an ability here in Texas to bring Republicans and Democrats
together in the public interest. I've watched him put his
compassionate conservative philosophy to work in this great state
with tremendous results. He's proven himself a leader with
consistency and conviction.
</P>
<P>
   I look forward to working with you, governor, to change the tone
in Washington, to restore a spirit of civility and respect and
cooperation. It's time for America's leaders to stop pointing the
finger of blame and to begin sharing the credit for success. Big
changes are coming to Washington, and I want to be a part of them.

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush formally introduced his
running mate, Dick Cheney, to a cheering crowd here Tuesday,
praising the former defense secretary and longtime family friend as
a man of ``great integrity, sound judgment and experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As Cheney stood almost bashfully at the side of the ebullient
Texas governor, Bush tacitly acknowledged the oddity of his
months-long search for a vice-presidential nominee ending with the
selection of the searcher himself.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney had been tapped by Bush to supervise that process in late
April. But over the ensuing weeks and months, Bush said: ``I
benefited from his keen insight. I was impressed by the thoughtful
and thorough way he approached his mission. And gradually I
realized that the person who was best qualified to be my vice
presidential nominee was working by my side.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cheney took Bush's place at a lectern set up in front of a
row of 30 American flags, his remarks _ only half as long as the
governor's _ suggested that Bush had found a No. 2 with precisely
the kind of loyalty that the governor had always said he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enthusiastically accept the challenge,'' he told Bush, ``for
this reason: I believe you have the vision and the courage to be a
great president. And I want to do absolutely everything I can to
make certain that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it had been clear for days that Cheney would almost
certainly be the governor's choice, their joint appearance in a
large meeting room here Tuesday marked the first formal
acknowledgment by the Bush campaign that Bush-Cheney was the ticket
with which the Republican Party would try to win the White House.
The two men's wives, Laura Bush and Lynne Cheney, shared a modest
stage with them.
</P>
<P>
   In turning to Cheney, Bush chose someone whose extremely
conservative record from 1979 to 1989, when he represented Wyoming
in the House of Representatives and reliably cast votes against
abortion rights and gun control, was sure to provide Democrats and
liberal interest groups with fodder for their assertions that a
Bush presidency would tilt sharply toward the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is probably as far right as anybody in the Republican Party
today,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic
minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The selection also raised questions about how Cheney, who was
entrusted with the task of screening other potential
vice-presidential nominees, was put through the process himself.
Karen P. Hughes, the director of communications for the Bush
campaign, said Tuesday that Bush had taken on at least part of that
chore, subjecting Cheney to the sorts of questions about finances
and other personal information that Cheney had asked other
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared to accomplish several goals at once by picking
Cheney. He supplemented his own limited career in government,
confined to the five and a half years that he has presided over the
nation's second largest state, with the accumulated wisdom of a man
who served as chief of staff under President Gerald R. Ford and
then spent a decade in the House before his appointment as defense
secretary in 1989 by President George Bush, the governor's father.
</P>
<P>
   And because the selection of Cheney did not on its face
represent an overtly political calculation, it enabled Bush to
maintain his claim to being someone who is more interested in good
government than political gamesmanship, someone who is more deeply
wedded to principles than to polls. There was no discernible
electoral strategy at work: Cheney maintains homes in Texas and
Wyoming, two states that Bush should easily win in November.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the remarks that Bush and Cheney made Tuesday amounted
to a preview of that pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is seeking not only to win an election, but also
to lead our nation,'' Cheney said in a voice that was softer,
deeper and steadier than Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, Bush had said: ``I have to admit something. I
didn't pick Dick Cheney because of Wyoming's 3 electoral votes,
although we're going to work hard to earn them. I picked him
because he is without a doubt fully capable of being the president
of the United States. And I picked him because he will be a
valuable partner in a Bush administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``partner'' suggested something else that Bush had been
looking for: someone with whom he felt a strong sense of comfort
and an equally strong sense of trust. Cheney clearly fit that bill,
partly because of his history with Bush's father, partly because he
helped the governor assemble a team of foreign policy advisers last
year and then got to know Bush even better over the last three
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously family-tested _ loyal all the way back,'' said
Professor Bruce Buchanan, a historian who teaches courses on the
presidency at the University of Texas and has closely monitored
Bush's career. ``He's comfortable _ they've developed a
relationship as a consequence of this search process.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan suggested that Cheney might also help fill any deficit
of substance that voters perceived in Bush. ``It's in keeping with
the great pains that he has taken all along to build a shadow
government that's made up of people who quiet the fears that he's
shallow and out of his depth,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Many prominent Republicans sold the selection a different way:
as evidence that Bush, 54, was so secure in his own abilities and
confident in his own leadership that he would recruit a teammate
like Cheney, 59, who looks at least 10 years older than the
governor and has a much longer political resume. Alternately,
Republicans said that Cheney's selection was proof that Bush was
earnestly filling in the gaps in his own experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sending a powerful signal that he's continuing his
preparations to become the president,'' said Gov. John Engler of
Michigan in a telephone interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Engler and other Republican leaders expressed enthusiasm about
the choice, saying that Cheney had a reputation on both sides of
the political aisle as a thoughtful, reasonable, intelligent
politician.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said that when
Cheney worked on Capitol Hill, ``he was not the kind of guy who was
threatening or in your face or, you know, partisan to the extent
that others didn't feel like they could work with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Cheney is just one of those people, if you're around him
any length of time, you just feel very comfortable with him,'' Lott
said. ``You grow to have a healthy respect for him.'' Lott added
that he had told Cheney several months ago that he would be the
best choice for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, whom many House Republicans had
promoted for a place on the ticket with Bush, said Tuesday that
Cheney's ``leadership skills are proven in many areas. He has an
incredibly impressive resume.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least a few other Republicans were puzzled. They
questioned why Bush, who has pledged to expand the party's appeal
and bring a fresh perspective to Washington, would pick a running
mate with such conservative bearings and such strong ties to the
Republican establishment of the past.
</P>
<P>
   And they wondered why Bush, long eager to emerge from his
father's shadow, would summon it anew with the choice of someone
from his father's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to a lot of observers _ and there's a lot of buzz
about this _ like this reflects his father's influence,'' said one
Republican strategist. ``And the campaign has spent two years
saying that his father doesn't have a big influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican strategist said, ``For all the running away
he's done from his father, now he's Velcroed himself to the old
man. It's the old Bush. It's just unfortunate. The Democrats are
gloating.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Tuesday that the only active role that former
President Bush had played in the process, other than being a
sounding board for his son, was to call a prominent cardiac surgeon
who is a family friend and ask him for his opinion on Cheney's
health. Cheney suffered three mild heart attacks more than a decade
ago and had bypass surgery in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers moved quickly Tuesday to dispel any doubts about
Cheney's physical fitness for the long road to November _ and
possibly beyond. The Bush campaign released letters from Cheney's
doctors at George Washington University that provided a detailed
synopsis of Cheney's medical history.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after Bush's introduction of Cheney, Hughes
was even able to answer a question about the specific food allergy
mentioned in one of these reports. The allergy was to pomegranates,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes also made a point of mentioning that when Bush, at home
in the governor's mansion Tuesday morning, placed a telephone call
to Cheney's house in Dallas to offer him a place on the Republican
ticket, Cheney was exercising on his treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney did not take questions from reporters, instead
sticking to the statements they had prepared.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney appeared on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' Tuesday night
to give his first interview as Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   He said the role he would play in a new, second Bush
administration would be that of a frank but discreet adviser. ``He
very much values people who level with him, who tell him exactly
what they think,'' Cheney said. ``I'm most effective when I'm able
to speak my piece, but also when I do it privately.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had found a real chemistry with Bush, and
earlier in the day, he, Bush and Hughes had provided some details
about the evolution of the relationship between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   According to these accounts, Bush had asked Cheney in March,
right after the governor effectively secured his party's
presidential nomination, if he would be willing to be considered
for the vice presidential nomination. Cheney said no.
</P>
<P>
   But about three weeks ago, Hughes said, Bush asked Cheney again,
and drew a different response.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' Bush said, ``he said he was willing to talk with
his family and consider it.'' He smiled broadly, and Cheney reached
over to his wife, Lynne, patted her on the shoulder, then held a
pair of crossed fingers in the air. The crowd of about 200
supporters and friends of the Texas governor laughed loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney provided an unusual physical counterpoint to Bush, whose
facial expression and demeanor conveyed an almost boyish
excitement. Cheney, by contrast, seemed to be trying to hide his
grin. He often cast his eyes downward and could not decide what to
do with his hands, which were alternately deep in his pockets and
clasped modestly in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were scheduled to take a campaign trip to Wyoming on
Wednesday, and Bush's aides said that on Friday, when Bush begins a
five-day trek to the Republican national convention in
Philadelphia, Cheney will accompany him for the first day's stops
in Arkansas and Missouri. Aides said that Cheney will then return
to Dallas, where he is chief executive of Halliburton, an energy
company, to put some business affairs in order before turning his
full attention toward the presidential race.

CHENEY WAS ONE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE VOICES IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS last graf with 4 grafs to add Cheney's comments on CNN
tonight; minor changes elsewhere.) 
(With BUSH-CHENEY) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his 10 years as a Republican congressman from
Wyoming, Dick Cheney had one of the most consistently conservative
voting records in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He regularly voted for the tightest restrictions on abortions,
including proposals to ban Medicaid coverage of abortions for poor
women whose lives could be endangered by continued pregnancy. And
he voted against all gun-control legislation, including measures
that were supported by all but a handful of lawmakers from both
parties, like one bill to regulate what are known as cop-killer
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   On issues in which business and labor were on opposite sides, he
invariably supported the business position. When developers and
environmentalists were at odds, he was on the side of the
developers.
</P>
<P>
   He opposed a constitutional amendment to guarantee equal rights
to women and voted against economic sanctions on South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   During Cheney's time in Congress, from 1979 to 1989, Democrats
controlled the House. As is normally the case with lawmakers in the
minority party, he was not directly responsible for any major
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   While rigidly conservative on issues, he was not known for
strident rhetoric and was well liked by Democrats. Cheney was not a
visible leader in the fight to outlaw abortion, but the National
Right to Life Committee said Tuesday that he voted against abortion
rights on all the roll calls for which he was present.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he voted in 1984 to define ``person'' under
discrimination laws to include fetuses. The sponsor of the measure,
which Al Gore, then a congressman, also supported, said its purpose
was to deny federal funds to all institutions performing abortions.
Cheney also supported a constitutional amendment banning abortion,
but the issue never came to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   He was an unwavering advocate of the Reagan administration's
economic policy of deep tax cuts, more spending for the military
and less money for social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Annual vote analyses by Congressional Quarterly showed that in
most of the years he was in the House, Cheney supported President
Ronald Reagan more consistently than almost any other member of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In only his second term, he moved into the Republican
leadership, and by the time he left, to become secretary of defense
under President Bush, he was the Republican whip, the No. 2
position. Had he stayed in the House, he might well have become
speaker when Republicans gained control in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his leadership responsibilities, Cheney was most deeply
involved in foreign policy and intelligence matters. He strongly
supported covert spending for guerrilla forces trying to oust the
communist governments in Nicaragua and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Cheney served as the top Republican on the House
committee investigating the Iran-contra affair. The committee
determined that the Reagan administration had secretly sold arms to
Iran and had used the proceeds to finance the rebels, known as
contras, in Nicaragua. Cheney voted against the final report, which
accused Reagan of failing to meet his constitutional mandate to
``take care that the laws be faithfully executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some issues important when Cheney was in Congress are no longer
in the news. For example, he repeatedly voted to produce the MX
missile, a hugely expensive weapon designed to carry 10 nuclear
warheads that was the symbol of what opponents considered the
excesses of the Reagan nuclear weapons policy.
</P>
<P>
   He also often voted against proposals to apply economic
sanctions on South Africa to protest that country's apartheid
policy. He even voted in 1986 against a nonbinding congressional
resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela from prison.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year in Congress, Cheney voted for a constitutional
amendment to ban busing for school desegregation. In 1980, he voted
against strengthening the laws banning discrimination in housing.
</P>
<P>
   The only time he turned against the Reagan administration on an
important issue was in 1985, when he helped lead a Republican
revolt against a bill negotiated by the president and Democrats to
overhaul the federal income tax system. He accused the
administration of selling out. Even after the bill was further
modified by the Republican-controlled Senate and came back to the
House in 1986, he voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan signed the tax bill and considered it one of his foremost
legislative accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Many other issues of Cheney's time in Congress will be top items
in this year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, he was one of just 21 House members to vote
against a bill regulating the manufacture, import and sale of
armor-piercing ammunition known as cop-killer bullets. He was one
of four who voted in 1988 against a proposal to ban firearms that
did not contain enough metal to be picked up by a metal detector.
</P>
<P>
   On education, Cheney often voted against Head Start, the federal
preschool program. He voted in 1985 against federal aid to college
students, and he opposed the creation of the Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   On the environment, he voted in 1987 against extending the Clean
Water Act and in favor of postponing sanctions against cities that
did not comply with it.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing Tuesday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' Cheney
discussed his conservative record and said ``I'm proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that some of his votes against certain programs in
the 1980s were motivated by his concern for fiscal responsibility
in an era when the nation did not have the projected surpluses it
has today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not vote against Head Start today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also spoke in a tempered voice about abortion. ``I don't
think it should be a defining issue for our party,'' he said,
adding that the party needed to be sensitive to different views
about abortion rights.

ORIOLES INSIST THE YANKEES' OFFER JUST DOESN'T CUT IT
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The two-prospect offer the Yankees made on Monday
for the Orioles' B.J. Surhoff was apparently not good enough, given
that on Tuesday the Baltimore general manager compared it to a
particularly aromatic cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Syd Thrift, the Orioles' executive, generally talked around
questions about the Yankees' offer, which included pitcher Dave
Walling, the Yankees' No. 1 draft pick in 1999, along with another
player to be selected from a group of three minor leaguers: the
Class AA pitcher Brian Rogers, the Class AA shortstop Erick Almonte
and the Class AAA pitcher Ryan Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   But when Thrift was asked if the Yankees' offer was close to
being satisfactory, he said: ``Far, yes. Close, no. Way, way far.
You can't even smell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's close to being like Limburger cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the proposal earlier, Thrift said, ``Just
because you were born at night doesn't mean it was last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrift could be bluffing, in an attempt to extract a better
offer from the Yankees. More likely, he is serious; talks between
the Orioles and the Yankees regarding Surhoff have repeatedly
stalled. Before the Yankees swapped Ricky Ledee and two pitching
prospects to Cleveland for David Justice last month, they offered
essentially the same deal for Surhoff and were rebuffed by Thrift.
</P>
<P>
   Thrift's suggestion that the Yankees' offer stinks, literally,
probably won't help the chances of the dialogue continuing, so the
Yankees officials will continue to explore other options. They know
what it will take to make a deal for Montreal's Rondell White
(Alfonso Soriano), as well as Pittsburgh's Wil Cordero and
Oakland's Matt Stairs (the Athletics recently asked for Ramiro
Mendoza, again).
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the Yankees don't seem particularly intrigued by any
one possibility. The likes of Cleveland's Manny Ramirez, Houston's
Moises Alou and Kansas City's Johnny Damon do not appear to be
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres were prepared to make a deal for Atlanta's
Brian Jordan, in order to then ship him to the Yankees for a
package of players, but the Yankees do not want to absorb Jordan's
five-year, $40 million contract, which he signed before last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff, 35, said he had heard nothing about the Yankees' offer
before reporters approached him Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even going to speculate on anything with the Yankees,
because I play for the Orioles,'' said Surhoff, who repeated that
his first preference is to play for Baltimore now and in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff has another year remaining on his contract, but an
option for the 2002 season should easily vest, with Surhoff
scheduled to make $3.5 million in 2001 and $4.5 million in his
option. Knoblauch Injured
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch was not in the starting lineup for Tuesday's
game because of irritation in the inside of his right (throwing)
elbow, and he will go to New York on Wednesday for tests, including
an MRI.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch apparently felt the twinge in his elbow while making
an awkward throw at the end of a rundown in Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, referred to Knoblauch's problem
as minor, and Knoblauch worked out before tonight's game and was
available to pinch-hit.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the Yankees' impressions on injuries have not
been accurate. Ramiro Mendoza said he felt discomfort in his elbow,
and shortly after Torre insisted to reporters that Mendoza's arm
was fine, the pitcher was placed on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez has said repeatedly that his elbow bothers
him, and despite three diagnoses from three doctors that resulted
in identical findings _ that Hernandez does not have any major
problems _ Hernandez is on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said after Monday's game that Roger Clemens had no injury
when he paused during the sixth inning and Torre and a trainer
tended to him, and several minutes later, Clemens said he
experienced cramps in his right quadriceps.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza allowed six hits and three runs in three innings tonight
in a Class A Florida State League game tonight, in perhaps his last
rehabilitation appearance before he is activated. It is expected
that Mendoza will be activated at some point during the four-game
series the Yankees will begin in Minnesota on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez threw off flat ground again Tuesday and assuming he
has no setbacks, he will throw in a bullpen session Wednesday. He
could be a couple of weeks away from being activated, if he
progresses as the Yankees hope he will.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Watson, who is on the disabled list because of weakness in
the back of his throwing shoulder, threw about 45 pitches in a
bullpen workout Tuesday at the Yankees' complex in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's primary concern was to rebuild the velocity in his
fastball _ which had dropped from 90 miles an hour to about 81
before he was placed on the disabled list _ and the initial
indications are that his fastball is better.

NIJA BATTLE, 37, DESIGNER OF FURS FOR MUSIC WORLD CELEBRITIES
</HEADLINE>
  By CATHY HORYN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nija Battle, who brought a swaggering sense of sophistication to
the furs she designed for the music world's most flamboyant
figures, died last Thursday while on a business trip in Montreal.
She was 37.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a brain aneurysm, said her sister, Saddiya Battle.
</P>
<P>
   For a designer who did not have a store, who often met her
future clients at clubs or outside restaurants, and who, until the
editor Andre Leon Talley wrote about her in Vogue last year, was
almost unknown in the fashion world, Battle had a large following.
Her custom-made furs were worn by entertainers like Whitney
Houston, Lil' Kim, Kid Rock and Puff Daddy, who had her make
trousers for him in black sheared mink.
</P>
<P>
   And although much of the attention at the Costume Institute's
``Rock Style'' gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art last December
was focused on fashion nabobs like Tom Ford of Gucci and Donatella
Versace, it was Battle of Brooklyn who designed the wraps worn by
Naomi Campbell, Iman, Lynn Whitfield and Mary J. Blige.
</P>
<P>
   Battle began making furs about 10 years ago, though in a sense,
she started as a child when she and her sister would take skins
given to them by their father, an avid hunter, and turn them into
blankets and doll clothes. The family lived in Brooklyn but had
relatives in North Carolina, and Battle, who was part Tuscarora
Indian, often visited a grandmother there who raised minks.
</P>
<P>
   After getting experience with Orchard Street furriers, Battle
started her own business and gradually gained a following among rap
and hip-hop stars who saw her out wearing her own designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people like Puff Daddy were photographed for magazines,
they'd say to the stylists, `I'm wearing my own coat,''' recalled
her sister. They meant, of course, Battle's furs. She also created
coats for a number of sports stars, and, on occasion, made
identical styles for their wives and children.
</P>
<P>
   Her custom-made designs, often dyed in colors like champagne,
burgundy and green, projected a high urban style _ what Talley
called ``a ghetto fabulousness'' _ that not only appealed to
Battle's celebrated clientele but also evoked 1970s fashion. She
was certainly among the first designers to recognize the appeal of
reviving that era.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her sister, she is survived by her mother,
Gladys, and her brother, Saleem Muhammad, both of Brooklyn.

CHENEY AS THE FINALIST: BUSH DID THE SCREENING 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Story, eliminated earlier, is now restored for publication.) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the end, it was Gov. George W. Bush himself
who did the final, most sensitive background check on the man who
was supposed to be the one running the vice presidential screening
process.
</P>
<P>
   So just as Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary, had met
with other finalists to go over questions about their personal
lives and finances, Bush questioned Cheney. As Karen P. Hughes,
Bush's spokeswoman put it, ``In this case, Governor Bush served as
the chair of the search committee.''
</P>
<P>
   That was just one of the oddities of a vice-presidential search
process that turned in on itself.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, in fact, only a couple of weeks ago Cheney flew to
Washington to conduct interviews with some of the other candidates.
But at the same time, he quietly visited his doctors for a
physical. The next day, July 12, his doctors gave him a clean bill
of health, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   And that night he called Bush to tell him there was no reason
why he could not accept the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time, he continued the search process, Hughes
said, because he wanted to make sure Bush had other options.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's courtship of Cheney began in March, just after the
Republican primaries had ended. Bush said he asked if Cheney would
be willing to be considered as a running mate. ``At the time,''
Bush said Tuesday, ``he said no.''
</P>
<P>
   So the governor instead on April 25 named Cheney, now chief
executive of a giant oil field service company in Dallas, as the
head of his vice-presidential search process. But even then, he
said Tuesday, ``I kept the thought of him joining me in the back of
my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Bush sent out hundreds of letters to party
leaders asking for their input. A list of vice-presidential
finalists received detailed questionnaires asking about their
health, their finances, their voting records, their military
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me two weeks to pull together everything required on
that vast questionnaire,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. ``It
meant getting my business partners involved, my accountants
involved, tax people, doctors, my staff, family. The questionnaire,
as you can imagine is rather intense. It's your whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel praised Cheney's selection, despite the work he had had to
do. ``My goodness, here's a guy who has the character, the
competence, the experience, the ability,'' Hagel said. ``I don't
have any problem with that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The questionnaires came back to the campaign. But this month
once again, Bush circled back to Cheney. It was the Fourth of July
weekend, and the two men were reviewing options at Bush's ranch.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, the two men walked out to the back porch and once
again Bush asked Cheney whether he would be willing to be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed,'' Bush said Tuesday, ``by the thoughtful and
thorough way he approached his mission. And gradually I realized
that the person who was best qualified to be my vice-presidential
nominee was working by my side.''
</P>
<P>
   This time Cheney said yes.
</P>
<P>
   So Cheney began reviewing not just a handful of finalists, but
also himself. ``He knew, he said, at that point that he would have
to begin looking at his own business, his own medical records, his
own background,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the search continued. That week Bush discussed the vice
presidency with Gov. George Pataki of New York on a campaign trip
into New Jersey and New York.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, on July 15, Bush summoned his three top aides _
Hughes, Karl Rove and Joe Allbaugh _ to meet with him, his wife,
Laura, and Cheney. ``We talked through the ramifications of the
leader of the search becoming a potential candidate in that
search,'' Hughes said. Rove, Bush's chief strategist, declined
Tuesday to spell out the considerations but said, ``Obviously, they
were not grave.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the vetting of Cheney began. Allbaugh, the
campaign manager, oversaw the examination of Cheney's voting record
and public history. How well he did should soon become apparent.
Already Tuesday night, on his first television appearance, on CNN's
``Larry King Live,'' Cheney was answering questions about his
congressional vote against the Head Start program and his
uncompromising opposition to abortion in all cases.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said Cheney's past was not unknown territory.
Cheney, who had a long government career, had been screened by the
FBI three times and had undergone Senate confirmation hearings. As
defense secretary under President Bush, he had held the nation's
highest security clearance.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush decided he wanted an independent review of
Cheney's health. He called his father and asked him to ask his
friend, the noted Houston heart surgeon, Denton A. Cooley, to speak
to Cheney's doctors.
</P>
<P>
   On July 18, Bush and Cheney met with another of the
vice-presidential contenders, John C. Danforth, a former senator
from Missouri, and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush himself at some point talked with Cheney about
his personal and financial background, but she did not provide
further details. After leaving his defense post, Cheney became the
chief executive officer of the Halliburton Company, a worldwide oil
field services company that has paid him millions of dollars in
salary and stock options.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that Bush's father was taking an interest in the
search, and a specific interest in Cheney. Hughes described the
former president's role Tuesday as ``that of a loving father,''
ready to lend an ear to his son. Asked if the former president
supported Cheney above all candidates, she said she was ``sure he
spoke highly of several of them.'' She said she did not know
whether he had personally called Cheney to lobby him.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Bush called Cheney at his home in Dallas and
asked him to be his running mate. Hours later they stood together
here in Austin before a crowd waving red white and blue pompoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' Cheney said of Bush, ``I learned how persuasive
he can be.''

DESPITE BRAND'S PITCH, FREE AGENTS NOT LURED TO BULLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KHARY K. McGHEE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Elton Brand was supposed to be the beginning,
the cornerstone of the Chicago Bulls' plan to rebuild a team
decimated by the loss of its championship trio of Michael Jordan,
Scottie Pippen and Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   With Brand, the No. 1 pick in the 1999 NBA Draft, and Ron
Artest, the No. 16 pick in the same draft, the Bulls hoped to
construct a solid team by adding quality veterans from this
summer's talent-rich class of free agents. The team cleared nearly
$19 million in salary-cap room, going 17-65 with bargain-basement
players such as Dickey Simpkins, Fred Hoiberg and Corey Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls have not been able to spend any of that money on
the free agents they coveted: Tim Duncan, Grant Hill, Eddie Jones,
Tracy McGrady and Tim Thomas. And Brand, an active recruiter for
the Bulls in the free-agent sweepstakes, is not happy the Bulls
have seemingly failed to lure any big names to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough not being able to sign the top free agents,''
Brand said during a basketball camp for youngsters. ``It's not over
until it's over. But it's tough, especially since I know what a
great city Chicago is.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams may negotiate with free agents this month, but free agents
may not sign until Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said he went to dinner last weekend with Thomas, a forward
for the Milwaukee Bucks and the Bulls' latest free-agent target,
trying to convince him to come to Chicago. But Thomas has said he
will re-sign with the Bucks, making him the third player to spurn
the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan will re-sign with the San Antonio Spurs, while Hill and
McGrady have said they will go to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a guard with the Charlotte Hornets, hasn't decided where
he'll sign, but there have been reports he will land with the Miami
Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been taking all the guys out, telling them what's going
on, letting them know what we're all about,'' Brand said. ``It's
hard to lure a player from the team that they're with.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bulls will rely on Brand, who led them in scoring (20.1)
and rebounding (10) last season. The Bulls added five rookies in
last month's NBA Draft, including Big 12 Player of the Year Marcus
Fizer and Jamal Crawford, a guard who left Michigan after his
freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want \Rto be the only leader\S,'' Brand said. ``I want
some veteran leadership on the team. Hopefully, we can get some
veteran starters to come help this team.'' \Ntagtop:Khary K.

U.S. SOFTBALL STAR REACHING OUT TO URGE GIRLS TO PURSUE SPORTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAWN REISS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Always a dreamer, Sheila Douty has a chance to share her dreams
in her new children's book, ``You Can be a Woman Softball Player''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that I can encourage and inspire young ladies to pursue
sports, particularly softball,'' Douty, 38, said. ``I want them to
learn that if they work hard at something, they, too, can achieve
their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The book discusses Douty's life and the basic fundamentals of
softball with drills. Douty's work is one in a series of ``You Can
Be a Woman'' books written for girls 8-14. The series offers
insight into careers traditionally dominated by men, such as
engineering, marine biology, architecture and athletics. Douty's
co-author is Judith Love Cohen, who helped design and engineer the
Hubble telescope.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a need for lots of books like these, so little girls
have female role models to look up to,'' said Douty, who lives in
Diamond Bar, Calif., east of Los Angeles. ``I feel we all have
obligations as role models, and this is just one way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``Quiet Thunder,'' Douty doesn't brag about her
accomplishments, but has come through time and again with
resounding plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the backbone of softball and has made an impact on the
national level,'' said UCLA head softball coach Sue Enquist, who
coached Douty from 1981-84. ``She's methodical and intellectualizes
the game, and she's clutch. She remains a quiet hero in our
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the first U.S. Olympic softball team in 1996, Douty
proved her worth in gold. Down one with the tying run at first,
Douty cracked a home run to win Team USA's gold-medal game against
China.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999 U.S. Olympic Cup, Douty hit a two-run homer in the
bottom of the seventh that gave the United States a 3-2 victory
against Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is an unsung hero in my eyes and to many others,'' Olympic
teammate Jennifer McFalls said. ``She really gets it done for us on
and off the field. She isn't the most glamorous, and she doesn't
jump in front of the camera. She just gets it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Douty has continued to deliver game-winning hits during Team
USA's 31-city tour in preparation for the 2000 Summer Olympics on
Sept. 15-Oct. 1 in Sydney, Australia. In her most recent game, Team
USA's 2-0 victory against the Florida Wahoos on Sunday, Douty drove
in the winning run with a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the person that everybody on the team goes to when they
need a strong opinion,'' Douty's husband, Joel, said. ``While they
don't have captains, she's the honorary captain, and the whole team
values what she has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Team USA (36-0) plays tomorrow in Oklahoma City before coming to
Gateway Park in Fort Worth, Texas, for a doubleheader Saturday. The
Olympians play the Fort Worth Stars at 6:30 p.m. and the Katy
Cruisers at 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in a Los Angeles suburb, Douty wanted nothing more
than to be the next first basemen for the Dodgers, following in the
footsteps of her hero, Steve Garvey.
</P>
<P>
   Douty never made it to the Dodgers, but she did play first base
at UCLA. She was a member of the Pacific-10 all-decade softball
team in the 1980s, helping the Bruins win national titles in 1982
and 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Douty continued to play internationally while earning her
masters degree in physical therapy from Southern California. Then,
she played for the Stratford (Conn.) Raybestos Brakettes and the
California Commotion while working as a physical therapist.
</P>
<P>
   She decided to make softball her career in 1994, when softball
was made an Olympic sport. Now, she must train even harder to
compensate for her age and persistent calf and leg injuries. She
relies on visualization techniques to practice hitting and
fielding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm normally someone who just pushes, pushes, pushes,'' Douty
said. ``but now it's less quantity and more quality with mental
training.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be Douty's last Olympics, and her expectations are
high. She wants to win gold and predicts Australia will be Team
USA's toughest competitor because they are the only team to beat
the U.S. in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Even after her career is over, Douty still has dreams for future
softball players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are on the brink of a huge uprising of female
athletics,'' she said. ``Young ladies have grown up being
encouraged to play sports at young ages, and because of that, we
are seeing better and better athletes.'' nn

ALBERT TAKAZAUCKAS, 56; DIRECTOR OF PLAYS AND OPERAS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Albert Takazauckas, who directed the original New York
production of David Mamet's ``Sexual Perversity in Chicago'' and
``Duck Variations'' and went on to a career as a director of plays
and operas, died on Monday in Los Angeles. He was 56 and lived in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   According to his father, Albert Takazauckas, he was having
dinner in a restaurant and apparently suffered a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The two Mamet one-act plays, which opened at St. Clement's in
1975, represented the playwright's New York debut. In his review in
The New York Times, Mel Gussow wrote that the plays were ``fresh
and pungent comedies about the rivalry within friendship and man's
natural propensity for role playing.'' About ``Sexual Perversity,''
he said, ``As directed by Albert Takazauckas, the play is a
multipaneled comic strip. . . The work on all counts is unforced
and spontaneous.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Takazauckas specialized in opera and directed
for regional companies around the United States, including ``Madame
Butterfly'' and ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' for San Francisco's Western
Opera Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, he directed Hugo Weisgall's opera ``Six
Characters in Search of an Author'' (based on the Pirandello play)
at the Opera Festival of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In his review in The New York Times, Anthony Tommasini said that
the director's ``handling of the six rootless characters was very
compelling. . . . grim, unnerving figures, ageless and bound
forever to their creator's conception.''
</P>
<P>
   Takazauckas was born in Manhattan. In addition to his father,
who lives in Manhattan, he is survived by a sister, Victoria, of
Bloomfield, N.J.

   LOS ANGELES _ Bob Bryan, a wild-card entry, lost to Australia's
Jason Stoltenberg in three sets in the first round of the
Mercedes-Benz Cup Tuesday at UCLA's L.A. Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan, a former NCAA singles champion at Stanford, fell 6-3,
3-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Former UCLA star Justin Gimelstob, now of Miami, is alive after
defeating Australia's James Sekulov 6-3, 6-3 late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob, who advanced to the semifinals here in 1998 but fell
in the second round last year, is considered a dark horse. He
figures to face tournament favorite Mark Philippoussis of Australia
in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   __ By default: Philippoussis entered as the No. 2 seed, but that
was before top-seeded Andre Agassi withdrew because of a back
injury. Philippoussis faces Chicago's Vincent Spadea in the first
round at 4 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis, 23, has won eight ATP singles titles and earned
more than $4 million in prize money. His best Mercedes finish was
fourth in 1997. Spadea, just 2-20 on the ATP tour this year, is
seeking his first singles victory, although he's won three doubles
championships in his seven-year career.
</P>
<P>
   __ It's all relative: Bryan also is participating in the doubles
competition. His partner is twin brother Mike. Ironically, their
opponents in the first round this afternoon, Taylor Dent and Brett
Hansen, are half-brothers, sharing the same father.
</P>
<P>
   __ No more color wars: Gimelstob and USC graduate Rick Leach
teamed up Tuesday for a 6-4, 6-4 doubles sweep over Zack Fleishman
and John Paul Fruttero.
</P>
<P>
   __ Also on tap: Third-seeded Marcelo Rios of Chile faces Japan's
Goichi Motomura in a first-round match at 7:30 tonight. Rios, the
former No. 1 player in the world, fought off injuries in 1999 but
won three tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-seeded Wayne Ferreira goes up against Paradorn Srichaphan

DICK CHENEY CERTAINLY CAPABLE; CAN HE HELP WIN THE ELECTION? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smart. Loyal. Experienced. Everything you want in a vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Except maybe one thing: Will Dick Cheney help George W. Bush win
the election?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney may bring a lot to the job, but he doesn't bring a lot
to the campaign,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, an independent political
analyst. ``Bush had an opportunity to take a step toward winning
the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, he basically said: `I'm ahead. I'm going to win this
anyway. Dick Cheney will be a terrific vice president. I'm not
going to worry about the Electoral College side of this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a former Wyoming congressman, doesn't add any states to
Bush's totals; Wyoming is a heavily Republican state. He doesn't
boost Bush in the polls, at least according to early soundings. And
he's no world-beater on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush acknowledged the lack of a political consideration in
his choice.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Bush said he hadn't picked Cheney
``because of Wyoming's three electoral votes....I picked him
because he is without doubt capable of being president of the
United States and will be a valuable partner in a Bush
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether a vice president should help the nominee
win the election has long been debated.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Richard Nixon once said the first consideration
in picking a vice president is whether he is qualified to be
president. The second: Would he be a good vice president?
</P>
<P>
   And third, Nixon said, how good a candidate will the vice
president be?
</P>
<P>
   ``And, of course, the third is always first because unless
you're a good candidate, you're not going to have a chance to
demonstrate either of the other two,'' Nixon said in 1988 on NBC's
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had more politically appealing options. He could have
selected Arizona's Sen. John McCain, who late in the process said
he wanted the job. He could have gone with popular Pennsylvania's
Sen. Tom Ridge, who likely would have tipped that crucial state in
Bush's favor.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there was retired Gen. Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big missed opportunity for the Republicans: George
W. Bush's failure to get Colin Powell to go on his ticket,'' said
Earl Black, a Rice University political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney's lengthy list of accomplishments could prove
invaluable. He is considered a Washington ``wise man,'' a veteran
of Washington's political wars, having served as the youngest chief
of staff in history when at 34 he was asked to run Gerald Ford's
White House. As defense secretary from 1989 to 1993, his greatest
triumph was the nation's resounding victory in the Persian Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, as a six-term congressman from Wyoming, he was known
for his consistent conservative stances on myriad issues, including
gun control, defense spending and taxes. Still, he was known for
his ability to work with Democrats. He became one of President
Ronald Reagan's most reliable supporters.
</P>
<P>
   By picking Cheney, an abortion foe, Bush can keep the GOP base
intact. Bush has said that consideration has been uppermost in his
mind, given the tendency of Republicans to split apart over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   That Cheney possesses the international and Washington
experience that Bush lacks could be a winning combination, said
Benjamin Ginsberg, a Johns Hopkins University political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, presidential nominees picked their running mates
based on a need to balance the ticket geographically or to appease
a certain wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   But the new style has more to do with the presidential nominee
trying to round out his personality, Ginsberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's voting choice for president is such a personal one for
each voter,'' Ginsberg said. ``It's based on so many issues
involving the personality and character of the (presidential and
vice presidential) nominees that more and more candidates are
looking to augment and supplement their personal characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insist they are undaunted by the Cheney choice. Look
for them to turn Cheney's experience against him. Roy Temple,
executive director of the Missouri Democratic Party, said Bush's
selection is a turn to the past, not something new and dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's old guard,'' he said. ``If they want to go back to the
recession and deficits of the Bush era, they have their chance
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Late-night talk-show hosts, meantime, were having a field day
with Cheney's health. He has suffered three heart attacks, the
first in 1978. In 1988, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the time it took me to walk out here, Dick Cheney had five
more heart attacks,'' Jay Leno said to open his Monday night
monologue.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts dismissed Cheney's health as an overriding concern.
Cheney, they point out, managed to oversee the Gulf War without
problems. And other prominent politicians, most notably former
President Lyndon Johnson, went on to lengthy public careers
following devastating health problems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Johnson suffered a major heart attack just six months
after he became Senate majority leader and spent weeks in recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats may also try to highlight Cheney's ties to the oil
industry. He made millions from his five-year association as
chairman of Dallas-based Halliburton Corp., a leading engineering
and construction firm focused on oil companies. Bush also has long
ties to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But said Rothenberg, ``I'd be surprised if it turned the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   How all this affects Democrat Al Gore's thinking on a running
mate remains to be seen. Some insiders immediately dismissed former
Sen. George Mitchell of Maine as a logical choice. He may too
closely resemble Cheney as a wise man from the past.
</P>
<P>
   After the Cheney pick, Gore is free to go in almost any
direction he wants, Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can go old, he can go north, he can go political or
non-political,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter.''

EDITORIAL: FAILURE AT CAMP DAVID 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 26:
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Camp David talks is a wrenching setback for
Israel, the Palestinians and the cause of Mideast peace. Israel's
prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat, came remarkably close to agreement on some of the most
difficult issues of the 52-year-old conflict. But they stumbled at
the most sensitive point, sovereignty over East Jerusalem. On that
subject Barak found Arafat unprepared to make the kind of hard
compromises needed to seal an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   There is now only a remote chance that a comprehensive peace
settlement can be reached before the Sept. 13 deadline the two
leaders have set. It will be difficult enough just to keep the
Middle East conflict from flaring into renewed tensions and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat deserve credit for coming to Camp David and,
for the first time, seriously discussing issues like borders,
refugees and Jerusalem. So does President Clinton, who committed
much time and energy to the talks and made extraordinary efforts to
keep the two sides engaged. Arranging the marathon meeting was a
risk, but it was a chance that had to be taken.
</P>
<P>
   On virtually every issue, previously unthinkable compromises
were discussed. But under the ground rules, none of these advances
will be binding absent an overall accord. Realistically, neither
leader has much chance of winning public support for painful
compromises unless they are part of a deal that delivers a final
peace. Nevertheless, the new understandings reached need not
evaporate. They may be revived if discussions on a comprehensive
agreement resume.
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, both sides will have to look more
creatively, and courageously, at Jerusalem. The larger burden lies
with Arafat. When the talks began two weeks ago, Israel was
insisting on retaining full sovereignty over East and West
Jerusalem while the Palestinians demanded a full return of the
East, including the Old City and its religious sites. Barak moved
far from his initial position, agreeing to consider expanded
Palestinian sovereignty over parts of East Jerusalem. Arafat,
encouraged by Egypt and Saudi Arabia to be unyielding, showed
little interest in American compromise proposals. Washington should
make clear its disappointment with Cairo and Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what happens next. Barak spoke on Tuesday of
considering all options, even a termination of the peace effort
that began with the Oslo agreement in 1993. His political situation
at home is tenuous, with his cabinet reduced to a parliamentary
minority. Conservative politicians argue that he has already shown
too much willingness to compromise. But public opinion supports
him, and he must persevere in his efforts to enhance Israeli
security through a fair and defensible peace.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat must also consider his next moves. He should begin by
resisting pressure to declare Palestinian independence, without an
agreement with Israel, on Sept. 13. Such a declaration would invite
new violence. Israel would probably respond by annexing areas of
the West Bank that it has until now envisioned as part of an
eventual Palestinian homeland.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement ending the Camp David talks, Barak and Arafat
recognized the importance of ``avoiding unilateral actions that
prejudge the outcome of negotiations.'' Proclaiming Palestinian
independence would be just such a step. If there is ever to be a
durable peace, Arafat must reconsider his unyielding approach to
Jerusalem.

TIGER WOODS' WORK ETHIC SHOULD BE OUR STANDARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most overlooked aspect of the Tiger Woods phenomenon is the
refurbished sheen it's giving the work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Once Americans begin to look past the natural gifts that have
made Woods the most skilled practitioner of what is arguably the
world's most difficult game, they will begin to understand what
separates him from other equally gifted colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, only in golf will the achievements won by his
willingness to work harder than anyone else be recognized for what
they are.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has become to golf what Michael Jordan was to basketball.
They're equals by dint of transforming already considerable
aptitudes for their games into performances that seem superhuman.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, according to basketball aficionados, was also one of the
hardest-working athletes of his or anyone else's era. This strength
may have been overlooked somewhat by casual observers, though,
because basketball is a team game.
</P>
<P>
   With Woods, however, the recognition of his work ethic's
contribution to his development will be more obvious, because golf
is an individual pursuit. This will be a good thing in a society
that for nearly a generation has encouraged underachievement among
its young people in the name of preventing hurt feelings and
fostering self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   This unfortunate trend manifests itself in developments such as
grade inflation, competition that de-emphasizes winning and
recognition of superior talent, and equal rewards for unequal
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes Tiger Woods to remind us that nothing pays off
like hard work. As good as Tiger is, everyone who closely follows
golf understands that his golfing life is as noteworthy for its
unstinting commitment to improving his already considerable skills.
</P>
<P>
   After Tiger's British Open victory capped a career grand slam of
golf's major tournaments, he was asked whether he could get better.
Certainly, Woods replied, without seeming to brag. It is, he said,
simply a matter of working on the aspects of his game that need
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said one of the most vivid memories he took from the U.S.
Open in June was returning from the practice range on Friday
evening and seeing 60-year-old Jack Nicklaus working on his putting
in the post-sunset gloaming of Pebble Beach's practice green.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus is the standard by which Tiger measures himself, and
the scene, Tiger related, was a potent reminder of the passion for
improvement that made Nicklaus the world's greatest golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved with golf see Tiger as a savior of the game who
will inspire youngsters to get interested and become the golf
industry's customers of tomorrow. If character is built along with
a rise in commercial fortunes, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's greatest contribution to American society, however, will
transcend golf if he becomes a symbol of how nothing worthwhile can
be attained without working for it. In this respect, Tiger is a
godsend for parents who need an example to show their children
what's possible if you are willing to work hard enough to achieve
it.
</P>
<P>
   Although golf is too hard for most to master, Tiger's example is
universal in the lessons it can teach young and old alike about
almost any pursuit, whether it involves sports, business, career or
life in general.
