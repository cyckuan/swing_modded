LAS VEGAS: he wanted.

<TEXT>
	   De La Hoya was in control the entire fight, but the 36-year-old
Chavez fought like a much younger fighter as he tried to get inside
the taller champion and trade punches.
	   De La Hoya wore down Chavez, and the exchanges between the
fighters began getting more lopsided in the middle rounds.
	   ``I think he's getting tired now,'' De La Hoya told his trainer,
Gil Glancy, after the fifth round.
	   Chavez was successful at times, rocking De La Hoya with some
lefts and rights, but he paid a terrible price. He was cut over the
left eye in the second round and over the right eye in the seventh.
	   ``I beat the old Chavez, the best Chavez anybody has seen in the
last five years,'' De La Hoya said.
	   It was the eighth round that finally proved the undoing for
Chavez as De La Hoya came out strong, looking to stop the fabled
Mexican fighter.
	   From the middle of the round on, the boxers went toe to toe as
the sellout crowd stood, roaring its approval. Blood streamed down
Chavez's face as he was rocked late in the round with a left hook,
and De La Hoya moved in for the kill.
	   De La Hoya landed a flurry as the bell sounded, and Chavez
followed him in anger as he turned back to his corner, claiming the
blows were late.
	   A few seconds later, Chavez sat on his stool as his corner
called the fight to an end.
	   ``It wasn't that he was strong. I just didn't have a smart game
plan. That's why the fight seemed so tough,'' De La Hoya said.
	   The crowd was chanting ``Chavez! Chavez!'' even while the
undercard was still going and it cheered wildly when he made his
entrance into the ring. The noise from the sellout crowd of some
18,000 was even more deafening when De La Hoya climbed into the
ring.
	   De La Hoya, who stopped Chavez on cuts in the fourth round of
their first fight two years ago for the junior welterweight title,
was an 8-1 favorite in the rematch in the heavier weight class.

Malaysian coach angry at Yuan Yu Fang
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's top track and field
gold medal hope Yuan Yu Fang was blasted by her coach after getting
disqualified in the 10-kilometer walk final at the Commonwealth
Games on Saturday.
	   Australia's Jane Saville stepped out of the shadow of two-time
champion Kerry Saxby-Junna for the first time to claim the gold
medal at Lake Titiwangsa.
	   Saville, 23, took 43 minutes, 59 seconds to complete the walk
after making a decisive break with about one kilometer to go.
	   Saxby-Junna, who won the first women's walk title in Auckland in
1990 and defended it in Victoria 1994, finished with silver. Lisa
Kehler of England was third.
	   Yuan Yu Fang, a former Chinese star recently given Malaysian
citizenship, was disqualified for having two feet off the ground at
the same time. The decisive third warning came 33 minutes into the
race as she was fighting Saville and Saxby-Junna for the lead.
	   ``After the second warning I told her to slow down but she
completely ignored it,'' said coach Wang Lin. ``This is the second
time she did not listen to my instruction. The first was in the
Italy national championship in Milan in April and she was punished
for the same mistake.''
	   South Africa made a strong start against Australia in the gold
medal playoff in the games' first ever cricket tournament.
	   Captain Shaun Pollock won the toss, sent Australia in to bat,
and then backed it up with a destructive opening spell. Pollock
took 3-12 off his first six overs as the Australians slumped to 28
for three.
	   He removed openers Mark Waugh (2) and Adam Gilchrist (15) and
No. 3 Ricky Ponting (2), leaving captain Steve Waugh and Michael
Bevan to attempt a rescue mission. The pair moved Australia along
to 57 for three after 17 overs before Bevan fell to a brilliant
piece of fielding.
	   Andrew Hudson's direct throw caught Bevan just short and
Australia was reduced to 58-4.
	   Waugh moved to 38 with Darren Lehmann 19 as Australia brought up
101 runs off 30 overs.
	   Australia's cyclists continued to dominate at the velodrome, but
an equipment failure robbed England of the top ranking in the
qualifying round of the men's 4,000-meter team pursuit.
	   England was on target for the fastest time but English rider
Robert Hayles' chain came off and he had to coast to the line,
leaving the team third behind Australia and New Zealand.
	   Australia's top sprinters, Darryn Hill and world championship
silver medalist Michelle Ferris, both won through to Saturday's
semifinals with impressive qualifying rides.
	   The main attraction in Saturday's track and field finals will be
the return of England's Diane Modhal four years after she was
banned from the 1994 games.
	   Modhal will face Mozambique's former world champion Maria Mutola
and Mutola's compatriot Argentina Paulino in Saturday night's
final.
	   Daniel Komen, former world record holder in the men's 5,000
meters, is one of three Kenyans looking for a clean sweep of the
medals.

Texas man arrested in connection with embassy bombings in Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By C. BRYSON HULL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ FBI investigators first asked Wadih El
Hage about his ties to a militant Islamic terrorist organization
almost a year ago during an interview in New York City. He knew
nothing, he told authorities.
	   But Thursday, those denials made the Arlington mechanic and
former personal secretary to terrorist Osama bin Laden the first
U.S. citizen to be charged in connection with the bombings of
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   El Hage was indicted on three counts of making a false
statement, and prosecutors in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan
said they expect to indict him on further charges on Monday. A
Justice Department spokesman said he was unaware what those charges
might be.
	   The FBI said El Hage lived with bin Laden, the militant Islamic
leader of the international terrorist group al Qaida, in Sudan
until 1994.
	   Most recently he lived in a second-floor apartment in an aging
neighborhood south of the University of Texas at Arlington. There
was no response Friday at the apartment.
	   The Kenyan cell of al Qaida is believed to be behind the Aug. 7
bombings which killed 258 people, including 12 Americans, and
injured thousands in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
	   El Hage is the second suspect with connected to a major
terrorist action to have come from the Dallas area.
	   Eyad Ismoil, 26, who lived in Dallas, was sentenced to 240 years
in prison for his role in the Feb. 26, 1993, bombing of the World
Trade Center in New York.
	   El Hage was subpoenaed to appear in New York, where he is being
held in lieu of bail. He could face up to five years in prison on
each count.
	   Investigators say El Hage, also known as Abdus Sabbur, lied when
he said did not know the first man arrested in connection with the
bombings, as well as one of bin Laden's military commanders. He was
interviewed by federal agents on three occasions: in New York on
Sept. 23, 1997, in Arlington on Oct. 17, 1997, and again on Aug.
20.
	   An FBI arrest warrant affidavit says El Hage knew 33-year-old
bombing suspect Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, the first suspect arrested in
the bombings.
	   Two of the complaints against El Hage stem from alleged lies he
told investigators last year regarding a top bin Laden associate,
military advisor Abu Ubaidah al Banshiri. The federal complaint
alleges El Hage also lied when he denied after the bombings that he
knew Odeh.

 &UR; De La Hoya repeats beating of Chavez &QL; 
 &UR; URGENT &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ This time Oscar De La Hoya made sure there
would be no excuses.
	   De La Hoya beat and bloodied Julio Cesar Chavez once again
Friday night before Chavez's corner signaled their fighter wanted
no more while sitting on a stool after the eighth round of their
WBC welterweight title fight.
	   Chavez was bleeding from the mouth and nose and had cuts over
both eyes, and had just taken a beating in the final minute of the
eighth round when his corner signaled to referee Richard Steele
that Chavez would fight no more.
	   It was the second time De La Hoya stopped Chavez, but this time
took twice as long as when they met two years ago for the junior
welterweight title and Chavez was stopped on cuts in the fourth
round.
	   Chavez fought gallantly but took the brunt of De La Hoya's
punches throughout the fight and was well behind on all three
scorecards when his corner called the fight.
	   The fight was a brawl from the early rounds on, as De La Hoya
pressed for the knockout he wanted to gain the respect he claims he
didn't get from Chavez the first time they met.
	   ``You did it. You did it,'' Chavez told De La Hoya as the two
embraced after the fight, finally giving him the respect he wanted.
	   De La Hoya was in control the entire fight, but the 36-year-old
Chavez fought like a much younger fighter as he tried to get inside

	   De La Hoya, who stopped Chavez on cuts in the fourth round of
their first fight two years ago for the junior welterweight title,
was an 8-1 favorite in the rematch in the heavier weight class.
	   Chavez hardly fought like an underdog, though, bringing glimpses
of his past greatness into a fight that figures to be his last
big-money event.
	   Punch stats showed De La Hoya threw 517 punches to 346 for
Chavez and landed 254 to 162. But Chavez kept pressing forward and
never backed off of exchanges in the middle of the ring as the
fight turned into a brawl.
	   One judge had De La Hoya winning seven of the first eight
rounds, while the other two had him winning six rounds.
	   ``He was a tough warrior,'' De La Hoya said. ``Anyone else who
went against him would have done worse.''
	   De La Hoya abandoned his jab early in the fight and was content
to brawl with Chavez as the fight wore on.
	   Chavez, who weighed in at 144{, had vowed to look like the old
Chavez, and he did at times. But De La Hoya was simply too strong
and too quick for a man 11 years his senior.
	   De La Hoya, 146{, who defended his 147-pound title for the fifth
time, moved to 29-0 with 24 knockouts while Chavez dropped to
101-3-2 in what figured to be the last big payday of his long
career.
	   De La Hoya is already set to fight undefeated Ike Quartey on
Nov. 21.

On the court: One shoe off
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ New Zealand badminton player
Geoffrey Bellingham didn't have his sole in the game.
	   That part of Bellingham's right shoe came off in his second game
against England's Mark Constable Friday evening. The Kiwi lost his
grip on the court while attempting to retrieve a baseline shot. He
threw off the shoe and continued.
	   He was then trailing 13-11 in the third round Commonwealth Games
match, which he lost 15-3, 15-11.
	   One of Bellingham's teammates rushed out of the stadium to get
him a new pair of shoes. Bellingham had lost by the time he
returned.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   VICTORY DAY: Malaysia may get a day off if the hosts win enough
medals in the 16th Commonwealth Games.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who promised the holiday,
didn't specify what the national squad would have to do to.
	   ``I may consider (a holiday) if we do very, very well,'' he
said.
	   On Saturday morning, Malaysia was fifth with five golds, eight
silvers and eight bronzes, behind Australia, England, Canada and
India. Seventy nations are competing in the Games.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CRASHING OUT: Australian cyclist Stuart O'Grady has been ruled
out of any further Commonwealth Games races after his fall in
competition this week.
	   O'Grady tore most of the skin off the left side of his body when
he crashed during the 42-kilometer (26-mile) time trial road race
Monday. He missed a scheduled race Friday.
	   Team doctor Brian Sando said O'Grady, who was given a pethidine
injection after the accident, was in too much distress to continue
competing.
	   ``He's still experiencing a lot of pain and discomfort,'' Sando
said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   RUNNING FOOTPRINTS: Following others' footsteps usually isn't
the way to win a marathon race.
	   But in the case of the Commonwealth Games marathon, the
footprints are pre-painted on the road, so the runners won't lose
their way in the 42.195-kilometer (26 mile, 385 yard) race.
	   There are no arrows or signs along the route _ just the bright
yellow footprints painted by the organizers for the athletes to
follow.
	   They could have painted a straight line for the runners, but
that would have cost 50 percent more, said an official.

Annan: No country can stand alone in financial crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Although financial turmoil and uncertainty
is sweeping the world, no country can afford to insulate itself or
ignore the less fortunate, the U.N. chief said.
	   The current financial crisis that began more than a year ago in
Asia ``threatens to further widen the gap between rich and poor,
both within countries and at the global level,'' Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said at the end of a two-day conference that focused on
the social and economic impact of the world's increasingly
intertwined and interdependent economies.
	   ``Globalization is the dominant feature of our times, and we
have no prospect of reversing it even if we wish to,'' he said.
``What we have to do is devise ways of managing it better. We have
to somehow maximize the benefits and to protect those who are in
danger of becoming victims.''
	   Annan said he recognized that many developing countries are
going through very difficult times this year.
	   ``The temptation to retreat into nationalism or populism can be
strong,'' he said. ``But I am encouraged to see that, in almost
every developing country, those false solutions are being
rejected.''
	   The United Nations, with nearly all the world's countries as
members and the ability to involve not state actors, is uniquely
equipped to help resolve the crisis, he said.
	   Annan praised Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas for urging
conference members Thursday to work together to overcome one
another's financial and social difficulties.
	   The collapse of Indonesia's currency last summer was part of an
Asian financial crisis whose effects have spread across the globe,
sparking riots in Indonesia and causing stock markets around the
world to gyrate wildly.
	   ``We also have a responsibility to ensure that nations do not
react by turning away from each other. But by coming together to
find solutions based on the founding principles, which we all have
in common,'' Annan said.
	   Many U.N. officials and representatives of poorer countries also
urged industrialized nations to remember that they shared
responsibility for the crises. The industrial world reaped the
benefits of developing nations' initial quick growth, they said.
	   ``In many of the bodies where decisions affecting the world
economy are taken ... the strongest voices are those countries
which have achieved economic success,'' Annan said. ``None of those
institutions is infallible _ nor would they claim to be _ but all
have a great deal of wisdom to offer.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. intelligence agency electronically
eavesdropped on foreign companies and passed information to U.S.
competitors to help them win business overseas, a major Tokyo
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The National Security Agency monitored phone calls, faxes and
electronic mail of European and Japanese companies since at least
1990, the Mainichi newspaper said, citing a report Wednesday by the
European Parliament, the European Union's legislature.
	   The newspaper quoted the report as saying the NSA, in an
operation named ``Echelon,'' used its vast eavesdropping network to

also involved, the paper said.
	   The paper said the report was submitted Wednesday to parliament
by its research bureau. Some of the findings also appeared in a

	   In one case, the NSA monitored talks between French electronics
company Thomson-CSF and the Brazilian government over sale of a
radar system. An unnamed U.S. company ended up winning the
contract, the paper said.

Chinese police detain more dissidents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police have detained a labor organizer in Beijing
and a dissident based in northeastern Jilin, human rights groups
said Saturday, as authorities tightened their crackdown on dissent.
	   Zhu Rui, a onetime political activist who sought to organize
protests by laid-off workers at her factory, was taken away by
police in the predawn hours Saturday morning, New York-based Human
Rights in China reported.
	   The group said Zhu also had been detained for 12 days during the
visit to China of U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson, who left
Beijing on Tuesday after a 10-day visit.
	   Zhu, who took part in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement in
Beijing, tried earlier this year to organize fellow laid-off
workers at Beijing's 3501 Uniform Factory to stage a peaceful
protest over the terms of their severance pay.
	   On Sept. 4, police dragged Zhu, who had hoped to try to meet
Robinson, away from her home as she was waiting for her son to
return from school. She was released Wednesday, only to be detained
again Saturday.
	   In another detention, police on Friday took Tang Yuanjuan, a
dissident from northeastern Changchun who was visiting Beijing for
medical treatment, away from the home of prominent dissident Xu
Wenli, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said.
	   The Hong Kong-based group said Tang had been in Xu's home for
only a short time when a group of police officers forced him to
leave. Since then, there has been no word on Tang's whereabouts, it
added.
	   Six fellow dissidents from Changchun issued an open letter
protesting Tang's detention, it said.
	   Tang is one of several workers at Changchun's massive First Auto
Works who were jailed for organizing sympathy protests with the
Tiananmen Square demonstrations in Beijing in 1989. A court later
commuted his sentence of 20 years to eight, and he was released
last year.
	   Tang and two of his fellow dissidents were interrogated and
threatened by police after they sent a letter to U.S. President
Bill Clinton urging him to press Chinese leaders on human rights
during his visit to China in June.
	   The visits by Clinton and Robinson prompted China's persecuted
dissident community to renew attempts to press for improved human
rights treatment. But Chinese authorities have responded harshly,
indicating there is no softening of the government's ban on public
dissent.

Reds down Cubs 6-4; no homers for Sosa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa's three-day weekend party got off to a
slow start.
	   Sosa, returning to Wrigley for the last homestand of the year,
didn't homer Friday. He didn't even get a hit, going 0-for-4 as the
Chicago Cubs lost 6-4 to the Cincinnati Reds.
	   Sosa remained tied with Mark McGwire for the home run record at
63 and the Cubs were in danger of losing their lead in the NL
wild-card race. Chicago began the day one game ahead of the New
York Mets, who played Florida on Friday night.
	   Blame Dmitri Young and Barry Larkin for spoiling the party. Each
drove in two runs and got four hits, and Young made a diving catch
that kept the Cubs from tying the game in the sixth inning.
	   Steve Parris (6-4) gave up four runs and five hits in five
innings. Gabe White retired the last 10 batters for his seventh
save, striking out pinch-hitter Glenallen Hill with two outs in the
ninth and Sosa on deck.
	   The faltering Cubs' pitching staff cost Chicago another game,
giving up six runs and 12 hits. Don Wengert (1-5) gave up one run
and two hits in two innings, including Larkin's go-ahead homer in
the sixth.
 &UR; Cardinals beat Brewers 5-2
	   In Milwaukee, Mark McGwire hit his 64th home run, pulling out of
a tie with Sammy Sosa in the race for the single-season record, as
the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Milwaukee Brewers 5-2 Friday
night.
	   McGwire hit a 3-1 pitch from rookie Rafael Roque (4-2) 417 feet
into the left-center field bleachers for a two-run homer in the
fourth inning. off Roque (4-2).
	   Darren Oliver (4-3) allowed two runs and seven hits in six
innings, and Juan Acevedo got three outs for his 11th save.
 &UR; Reds 6, Cubs 4
	   In Chicago, Sosa went 0-for-4, remaining at 53 homers. Despite
the loss, Chicago remained one-game ahead of the Mets in the NL
wild-card race.
	   Dmitri Young and Barry Larkin each drove in two runs and got
four hits, and Young made a diving catch in left that kept the Cubs
from tying the game in the sixth.
	   Steve Parris (6-4) gave up four runs and five hits in five
innings, and Gabe White retired the last 10 batters for his seventh
save. Don Wengert (1-5) gave up one run and two hits in two
innings.
 &UR; Marlins 7, Mets 6
	   In New York, John Franco (0-8) wasted a 6-4 lead in the ninth
when Todd Dunwoody hit a two-run single and Edgar Renteria hit a
sacrifice fly.
	   Dunwoody, Cliff Floyd and Kevin Orie homered for the Marlins,
who at 51-103 have the worst record in the major leagues.
	   Brian Edmondson (4-4) got one out in the eighth for the win.
Matt Mantei put the tying run on in the ninth before getting his
ninth save.
 &UR; Astros 5, Pirates 2
	   In Pittsburgh, Randy Johnson (9-1) took a no-hitter into the
seventh inning before giving up four hits. Johnson, 6-0 with a 1.13
ERA in his last six starts, struck out 12 in 7 1-3 innings.
	   Houston (98-57) won its 98th game and needs only two victories
in their final seven for the first 100-win season in its 37-year
history.
	   Craig Biggio went 4-for-5 and drove in two runs. Elmer Dessens
(2-5) was the loser.
 &UR; Expos 11, Phillies 4
	   In Philadelphia, Orlando Cabrera had a career-high four hits,
including three doubles, and Brad Fullmer hit a three-run homer.
Montreal matched its season high with 18 hits.
	   Javier Vazquez (5-14), who had only one victory in his previous
12 starts, allowed three earned runs and eight hits in five
innings. Anthony Telford pitched four scoreless innings for his
first save.
	   Mark Portugal (9-5) was tagged for seven runs and 12 hits in 4
2-3 innings.

<TEXT>
	   In Chicago, Frank Thomas reached 100 RBIs for the eighth
consecutive season with a two-run homer that helped the Chicago
White Sox beat the Boston Red Sox.
	   Thomas became the first player to accomplish the feat since
Willie Mays from 1959-66.
	   Despite the loss, Boston's retained its five-game lead over
Toronto in the AL wild-card race. The Blue Jays lost 6-1 at Tampa
Bay.
	   Jim Parque (7-5) gave up seven runs on nine hits in five-plus
innings but still earned his fourth straight victory. Bill Simas
allowed Mo Vaughn's 36th homer, but got the final three outs for
his 18th save.
 &UR; Yankees 15, Orioles 5 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, David Wells got his 18th victory despite another
poor performance and rookie Shane Spencer hit a grand slam in a
seven-run ninth as the Yankees moved closer to the AL record for
wins.
	   It was the 106th win for the Yankees, five short of the record
set by the 1954 Cleveland Indians. New York (106-46) has 10 games
left.
	   Wells (18-4) snapped his first two-game losing streak of the
season even though he gave up five runs, 11 hits and a walk in 5
1-3 innings. The left-hander has allowed 14 runs and 24 hits in his
last three starts.
	   Spencer's first career slam came in the ninth against Jesse
Orosco, who was making his 1,023rd appearance to pass Lee Smith for
fourth place in games pitched. It was also Orosco's 1,019th relief
appearance _ second most in baseball history.

Red Cross disputes Mexican president over aid efforts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ The Red Cross had responded to
President Ernesto Zedillo's accusation that private charities have
not helped flood-battered Chiapas state, saying the government has
refused to help deliver aid.
	   ``With Hurricane Pauline last year, we had the support of the
army and the navy, but that was not the case this time,'' the head
of Mexico's Red Cross, Jose Barroso, said Friday.
	   During a visit to the southern state on Thursday, President
Ernesto Zedillo had pointed to a woman wearing a Red Cross insignia
and said he had not seen ``a single kilo'' of the goods collected
by Mexico City Red Cross volunteers arrive in Chiapas
	   An estimated 450,000 people have been made homeless by last
week's flooding in an area the size of Belgium. The death toll is
162 and rising as reports come in from isolated towns.
	   Barroso said the army's decision to distribute only government
aid had left the Red Cross struggling to reach people in hundreds
of villages cut off by downed bridges and destroyed roads.
	   ``Through our own efforts, we have been sending aid on boats and
trains,'' he said.
	   He said the Red Cross had managed to send 1,020 tons of the
1,815 tons of aid it has collected and had exhausted its emergency
fund of nearly dlrs 130,000, but has received an additional dlrs
75,000 in donations from across Mexico.
	   Barroso refused to say if he agreed with critics who claim the
government was hindering independent charities because some
communities are sympathetic to the leftist Zapatista National
Liberation Army that rebelled in 1994.
	   The Chiapas state government on Friday denied allegations it was
hindering aid shipments to opposition-run areas, challenging
critics to bring criminal complaints if they have evidence.
	   Zedillo's office had no response Friday to Barroso's statements.
	   More than 4,400 volunteers were working at the agency's Mexico
City headquarters Friday to sort donations of food, water, medicine
and other supplies.
	   The heavy rains that have pounded much of Mexico for the past
two weeks claimed victims in other states on Friday.
	   The Queretaro state civil defense agency said three people had
died and five were missing in the central city of San Juan del Rio.
They had been aboard a van that crashed and fell into the San Juan
River, according to the government's Notimex news agency.
	   The body of a 15-year-old boy was recovered in San Miguel el
Alto in the north-central state of Jalisco, Notimex reported.
Witnesses said he was riding a bicycle and slipped off a bridge
into a flooded river.

Three in doubt for Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Injury concerns over three players have
prompted Australian coach Rod Macqueen to delay naming his side for
Tuesday's rugby union World Cup Pacific qualifying match against
Tonga until Sunday.
	   Several of the Wallabies picked up knocks in Friday night's
66-20 victory over Fiji in the opening round of the four-nation
round-robin series.
	   The players causing most concern are hooker Phil Kearns (knee),
halfback George Gregan and fullback Joe Roff, both with rib
injuries. Forwards David Wilson, Willie Ofahengaue and Tom Bowman
also have minor injuries.
	   ``Phil Kearns has a corked knee and he will be under observation
over the next 24 hours, George Gregan has bruised ribs and Joe Roff
has a rib injury and we're hoping he will be OK,'' Australian team
manager John McKay said Saturday.
	   Ofahengaue has Achilles tendinitis, Bowman a cut hand and Wilson
a bruised hand, McKay added.
	   Should Kearns and Gregan miss out, Jeremy Paul (four tests) and
Chris Whitaker (two tests) would come into the side.
	   Tongan outside center Sam Alatini will miss Tuesday's game after
he was given a one-match suspension Saturday by Rugby World Cup
judicial commissioner Bruce Squires of New Zealand.
	   Alatini pleaded guilty to a dangerous tackle on Western Samoan
winger Brian Lima which resulted in him being off by South African
referee Tappe Henning near the end of the match won 28-20 by
Western Samoa.
	   Fiji plays Western Samoa in the other Tuesday match at Bruce
Stadium in Canberra. (djp)

Mexican prosecutors link killings to drugs; 10 detained
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP photos ENS104-105
 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ENSENADA, Mexico (AP) _ Prosecutors say the head of massacred
family apparently was a minor-league drug trafficker with links to
the feared Arellano Felix smuggling gang.
	   Baja California State Attorney General Marco Antonio de la
Fuente told a news conference Friday that 10 people had been
detained for questioning after the discovery of guns similar to
those used to shoot 18 people near this popular beach resort.
	   Officials confirmed reports that Fermin Castro, owner of the
ranch where the shootings occurred, was suspected of drug
trafficking and links to a lieutenant of the notoriously violent
Arellano Felix gang based in Tijuana, 60 miles (96 kilometers) to
the north.
	   ``The evidence shows that Mr. Castro had problems with other
people over drugs,'' de la Fuente said. ``The motive appears to be
problems between two or three groups involved in drug
trafficking.''
	   But they portrayed him as a relatively minor figure who paid
drug bosses for the right to meet and move air shipments of
marijuana, not more valuable cocaine.
	   Castro was in a coma late Friday with bullet wounds to the head.
	   Eighteen members of his extended family were killed _ eight
children and 10 adults, including a woman 8 months pregnant _ who
were awakened before dawn Thursday, pulled to a patio by black-clad
attackers and repeatedly shot.
	   De la Fuente said Castro apparently had been tortured before he
was shot. A trail of blood led from his body to a chair in the
house and there were signs he had been beaten.
	   State Police Commander Felipe Perez Cruz said the investigation
had been slowed by the reluctance of neighbors to act as witnesses:
	   ``The neighbors refuse to give information, and the relatives as
well, out of fear.''
	   While an array of state and federal agencies continued to probe
the case, the federal attorney general's office said it would take
charge because drug and weapons violations fall under its
jurisdiction.
	   Gen. Jose Luis Chavez, chief of the federal agency's office for
Baja California, confirmed that officials had been investigating
Castro.
	   ``We were preparing to ask for a search warrant'' of Castro's
house, ``but unfortunately events got ahead of us.''
	   The respected magazine Zeta of Tijuana in June said a federal
report identified Fermin Castro as a member of the Arellano Felix
drug gang and said he was known as ``The Iceman.''
	   De la Fuente said Castro ``had some contact and paid landing
rights'' to an Arellano Felix lieutenant, Ismael Higuera Guerrero.
	   ``But he was not within the formal structure'' of Higuera's
group, the attorney general said.
	   Zeta said government documents indicated Castro had small
drug-smuggling airplanes that landed on airstrips in the desert
east of Ensenada.
	   The magazine's Friday issue said two other victims of the
massacre also were identified as minor drug figures in police
investigative reports.
	   Relatives waited in the parking lot of the hospital on Friday
wearing cowboy hats and leaning on their pickup trucks. They denied
Castro had drug ties and said he had no known enemies.
	   ``He didn't own guns. He wasn't a violent man,'' said Castro's
brother Gilberto. ``He was more of a humble man.''
	   In an interview on the Televisa television network, Zeta
Publisher Jesus Blancornelas _ who was wounded in a November 1997
assassination attempt _ said the attack was not typical of drug
gangs.
	   ``There's an unspoken rule among drug smugglers that children
are untouchable,'' he said.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Rescuers lowered ropes from
helicopters Saturday to save passengers who survived more than 12
hours in storm-buffeted seas after a Philippine ferryboat sank with
443 people aboard.
	   The coast guard said at least 194 people, many covered with
black fuel oil and grease, were rescued from the Princess of the
Orient by naval ships, helicopters and a passing fishing boat that
picked up 14 people.
	   No bodies were immediately found, they said.
	   The ship sank in rough seas several hours after it left Manila
for the central city of Cebu. Dozens of relatives waited, some
crying, outside the ship company's office in Cebu for word of
survivors.
	   No foreign names were on the ship's manifest, coast guard
spokesman Joel Garcia said.
	   A crew member told The Associated Press that the ship's cargo
appeared to have suddenly shifted to the left in the heavy seas.
	   ``We did not have any warning,'' he said. ``The passengers were
unaware of what was happening. When they realized what was going
on, it was too late.''
	   Tomas Banzon, 25, a survivor picked up by the fishing boat, said
he was sleeping in the ship's economy section on the top deck at
about 10 p.m. when he heard shouting and felt his bed tilting.
	   He put on a life jacket, rushed outside and jumped into the
water, swimming quickly away to escape the ship's suction as it
sank, he said.
	   ``People were shouting, crying, calling out names,'' he said.
``I wanted to save them but I couldn't do anything.'' He said he
floated in the rough seas until about 4 a.m. (2000 GMT), when he
was picked up by the fishing boat.
	   Geronimo Socrates, the skipper of the fishing boat, said he had
difficulty maneuvering the boat to the survivors because of the big
waves.
	   ``They were very scared. One of them clutched me and did not let
go. I told him, `Stay calm, we will save all of you.'''
	   Sulpicio Lines, which owns the ship, said it left Manila about 8
p.m. (1200 GMT) Friday for Cebu.
	   A few hours later it reported it was listing near Fortune island
off Batangas province, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) south of
Manila, and lost radio contact with its office in Manila around
12:30 a.m. Saturday (1630 GMT Friday), the company told naval
authorities.
	   In another contact from the ship, a military colonel on board
called his aide in Manila by cellular telephone late Friday and
desperately asked for help, his aide said.
	   The company initially reported there were 402 people aboard the
ship but later raised the number to 443, with 351 passengers and 92
crew members.
	   Tropical storm Vicki, with 75 kilometer (45 mile) per hour
winds, was located about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of
Manila late Friday, weather reports said.
	   A storm warning raised Friday prohibited ships of less than 500
tons from sailing but did not apply to the 13,000-ton Princess of
the Orient, Garcia said.
	   The storm also caused heavy flooding in many parts of the Manila
area.
	   Ferries are the main mode of transportation among the
Philippines' more than 7,000 islands.
	   In 1987, the Philippines suffered the world's worst peacetime
shipping disaster when the ferry Dona Paz collided with a tanker,
killing 4,341 people.

De La Hoya repeats beating of Chavez
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Oscar De La Hoya finally heard the words he
wanted to hear.
	   They came from the bloodied mouth of Julio Cesar Chavez, who was
finally ready to give De La Hoya his due.
	   ``You beat me,'' Chavez whispered as the two embraced in the
middle of the ring Friday night.
	   Indeed he did. And this time, De La Hoya made sure there would
be no excuses, battering Chavez for eight rounds before the
challenger finally sat on his stool and said he had had enough.
	   De La Hoya retained his WBC welterweight title by outpunching
the game but bloody Chavez for the second time, much like he beat
him when they first met two years ago.
	   He got the praise he couldn't get from beating Chavez in the
first fight.
	   ``He beat me right,'' Chavez said. ``I told him this would be a
great fight and he would get my respect. I give him my respect
now.''
	   It was respect that came at a price for the 36-year-old Chavez,
who was cut early and then battered in the eighth round that ended
with blood flowing from a deep cut in the challenger's mouth.
	   His corner told referee Richard Steele he wouldn't fight any
longer, a decision Chavez didn't protest. The undefeated De La Hoya
leaped in the air in jubilation and his cornermen joined him in
celebration.
	   Chavez had put up a game fight in one of his best performances
in years, but it wasn't nearly enough in a bruising battle that had
an excited crowd of 17,125 on its feet.
	   ``He was a tough warrior,'' De La Hoya said. ``I beat the old
Chavez, the best Chavez anybody has seen in the last five years.''
	   Chavez and De La Hoya had just finished the most intense
exchange of the fight, a one-minute war late in the eighth round
that saw both fighters trade punches when Chavez walked back to his
corner.
	   Blood was flowing from a deep cut on his lower lip and from his
nose, and there were cuts over both eyes.
	   It was the second time De La Hoya stopped Chavez, but this time
took twice as long as when they met two years ago for the junior
welterweight title and Chavez was stopped on cuts in the fourth
round.
	   Chavez fought gallantly but took the brunt of De La Hoya's
punches throughout the fight and was well behind on all three
scorecards when his corner called the fight.
	   The fight was a brawl from the early rounds, as De La Hoya
pressed for the knockout he wanted to gain the respect he claims he
didn't get from Chavez the first time they met.
	   De La Hoya wore down Chavez, and the exchanges between the
fighters became more lopsided in the middle rounds. Neither fighter
was knocked down.
	   ``I think he's getting tired now,'' De La Hoya told his trainer,
Gil Glancy, after the fifth round.
	   Chavez was successful at times, rocking De La Hoya with some
lefts and rights, but he paid for being aggressive. He was cut over
the left eye in the second round and over the right eye in the
seventh.
	   It was the eighth round that finally proved the undoing for
Chavez as De La Hoya came out strong, looking to stop the fabled
Mexican fighter.
	   From the middle of the round on, the boxers went toe to toe as
the sellout crowd stood, roaring its approval. Blood streamed down
Chavez's face as he was rocked late in the round with a left hook,
and De La Hoya moved in for the kill.
	   De La Hoya landed a flurry as the bell sounded, and Chavez
followed him in anger as he turned back to his corner, claiming the
blows were late.
	   ``It wasn't that he was strong. I just didn't have a smart game
plan. That's why the fight seemed so tough,'' De La Hoya said.
	   The crowd was chanting ``Chavez! Chavez!'' even while the
undercard was still going and it cheered wildly when he made his
entrance into the ring. The noise was even more deafening when De
La Hoya climbed into the ring.
	   De La Hoya, who stopped Chavez on cuts in the fourth round of
their first fight two years ago for the junior welterweight title,
was an 8-1 favorite in the rematch in the heavier weight class.
	   Chavez hardly fought like an underdog, though, bringing glimpses
of his past greatness into a fight that figures to be his last
big-money event. De La Hoya earned at least dlrs 10 million while
Chavez was to receive some dlrs 6 million.
	   Punch stats showed De La Hoya threw 517 punches to 346 for
Chavez and landed 254 to 162. But Chavez kept pressing forward and
never backed off of exchanges in the middle of the ring as the
fight turned into a brawl.
	   One judge had De La Hoya winning seven of the first eight
rounds, while the other two had him winning five rounds with one
even.
	   ``He was a tough warrior,'' De La Hoya said. ``Anyone else who
went against him would have done worse.''
	   Chavez, who weighed in at 144 1/2 pounds (65 kilos), had vowed
to look like the old Chavez, and he did at times. But De La Hoya
was simply too strong and too quick for a man 11 years his senior.
	   De La Hoya, 146 1/2 pounds (66 kilos), who defended his
147-pound (66.68-kilo) title for the fifth time, moved to 29-0 with
24 knockouts while Chavez dropped to 101-3-2 in what figured to be
the last big payday of his long career.
	   De La Hoya is already set to fight undefeated Ike Quartey on
Nov. 21.

Police censor entries at film festival, Singapore film banned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Entries in Thailand's first major film
festival are being carefully censored by police, and at least one
has been banned, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   Police cracked down on the first day of the festival Friday,
demanding that all entries be scrutinized before being shown to the
public, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   The week-long festival, the first of its kind in Thailand, will
present about 140 features, short films and documentaries produced
by independent film makers from 18 countries.
	   The police ordered the withdrawal of ``Bugis Street,'' a
Singapore entry depicting transvestites who populated Singapore's
red-light district in the 1960s, claiming it was pornographic.
	   Several other films may also be banned, the Post said.
	   The withdrawal of ``Bugis Street'' reportedly surprised
organizers and viewers because the film was allowed to be shown at
a similar festival in Singapore, which is known for its tough
censorship laws.
	   Many artists, editors and others in Thailand have criticized the
country's censorship laws and practices as outdated.

Waugh rescues Australia with 90 not out, sets S.Africa 184 run
</HEADLINE>
target &QL; 
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Captain Steve Waugh scored an
unbeaten 90 to lead Australia from 58 for 4 to 183 all out in the
inaugural Commonwealth Games cricket final against South Africa on
Saturday.
	   South African captain Shaun Pollock destroyed Australia's top
order with three wickets in his opening spell and finished with
4-19 off nine overs. Waugh has scored 215 runs in five innings over
the past 10 days without losing his wicket.
	   On Saturday, Waugh stepped in after the fall of Adam Gilchrist
in the 9th over and saw seven Australians come and go as he
patiently built up the innings. He ran out of partners in the last
over with three balls to go.
	   Fast bowler Pollock shocked Australia in the third over,
dismissing opener Mark Waugh who played down the leg side to give
wicketkeeper Mark Boucher a catch. Ponting was next to go as he
pulled Pollock a little too quickly, giving a catch at mid-on when
the score was only 16 in the 5th over. Pollock's third victim was
Adam Gilchrist, who also tried to pull in 9th over and gave a catch
to Mike Rindel at mid-on.
	   Waugh opened his account with a square cut that was perfectly
perpendicular to the pitch. Michael Bevan, who partnered Waugh for
30 runs, was run out by a direct throw from Andrew Hudson at mid-on
at the bowler's end.
	   It was only the first South African run out success from six
throws that narrowly missed the stumps and the beneficiary of most
of the luck was Bevan.
	   Waugh then got a good support from Darren Lehmann (26) in a
63-run stand and brought up his 50 in 70 balls in the 34th over.
One over earlier, he had pulled left-arm spinner Nicky Boje for a
six to the mid-wicket boundary.
	   That was only one of his eight big hits, evidence of his
patience and concentration in painstakingly building up his 50. He
hit a similar six again in the 42nd over off Paul Adams and added
six fours.
	   Waugh had similarly rescued Australia in the semifinal match
against India, making an unbeaten 100 after coming in to bat at 84
for 5. Tom Moody, his successful partner in the innings against
India was out cheaply for three, stumped off left arm spinner
Adams, who also got Brad Young, caught Dale Benkenstein at forward
short leg.
	   Australia went into the last over at 180 for nine and Waugh at
87. He added three more before his last partner, Damien Fleming,
was run out to brilliant fielding at mid-on by Derek Crookes who
dived, caught the ball and hurled it at the stumps while lying
down.

	   The Clinton grand jury testimony, the Lewinsky testimony and the
rest of the 2,800 pages of Starr documents will be made public by
the House Judiciary Committee when the Clinton videotape is
released at approximately 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT) Monday.
	   The Government Printing Office is printing the materials in
bound form.
	   Sometime after the printed transcripts are distributed _ how
much longer is not known _ we expect to get the materials
electronically.
	   Because of the volume, the full texts of the testimony and
documents will not move on regular news wires.
	   Instead, once they are in electronic form, we will provide the
full texts in ASCII and HTML formats at an ftp site. We have
arranged for an ftp server with additional capacity to handle the
expected demand. This means the files will not be at the same
address used to deliver the Starr report last week.
	   We will send an advisory Sunday with the address of the ftp
server and a number to call Monday to get the username and
password. The username and password will NOT be available before
then.
	   Running excerpts will move on regular news wires in two
versions, a long and a short. We cannot estimate wordage until we
see the documents. The excerpts will be edited; much of the
sexually graphic detail may be deleted and any that remains will be
carefully flagged.
	   The full transcripts on the ftp site and will be unedited and
will move in the official form provided by the House Judiciary
Committee.
	   Edited video clips in RealVideo and QuickTime formats from the
videotape of President Clinton's testimony will also be available
at the ftp site.
	   Additionally, we will post the text files and video excerpts on
The WIRE, the AP's public Web site that is displayed by newspaper
and broadcast sites around the world.
	   APTV, the AP's international video service that provides video
to 200 broadcasters in the United States and abroad, plans to carry
the video in full, unedited, as soon as it is made available.
	   Warnings about explicit language will be shown both on screen
and in APTV advisories before the tapes are played.
	   AP's Hotline audio channel will carry the audio from the tapes
live, as they are released on Capitol Hill. This transmission will
be unanchored. In addition, AP Network News and AP's actualities
service will have sound bites from the tape throughout the day.

Congolese President Kabila flies to Libya, violating sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Congolese President Laurent Kabila has flown
to Libya, violating U.N. sanctions banning air travel to the North
African country, Libya television reported.
	   Kabila's arrival Friday makes him the sixth African leader to
have flown directly to Libya this month in accordance with an
Organization of African Unity decision to no longer honor the air
embargo.
	   The U.N. Security Council expressed its concern Friday that
African statesmen were repeatedly violating the sanctions.
	   Kabila expressed his support for the OAU policy, saying the
Congo believes ``the imposition of the embargo against Libya is
unjust,'' the television said, according to a British Broadcasting
Corp. transcript of the broadcast received in Cairo.
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 to try to
force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to surrender two suspects in
the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed 270 people. The sanctions also bar arms
sales, freeze some foreign assets and limit sales of oil industry
equipment.
	   At its June summit, the OAU urged members to ignore the embargo
when traveling to Libya for humanitarian or official reasons.
	   The U.N.-approved mode of travel is for visitors to fly to
Tunisia and cross overland into Libya.
	   Libyan television said Kabila, who was accompanied by justice
minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo, went straight from
the airport to meet Gadhafi.
	   Kabila, whose government is fighting a rebellion in eastern
Congo, said he hoped to ``exchange views (with Gadhafi) on some
issues of interest to the African continent.''
	   Libya asked the Arab League this week to join the OAU in
ignoring the sanctions. But the League decided, at a meeting of its
foreign ministers in Cairo, to adhere to the sanctions until an
agreement is reached with Libya on handing over the Lockerbie
suspects.
	   Libya's Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser denounced the
League's decision as a ``joke''.
	   The U.N. Security Council endorsed a U.S.-British plan for the
suspects to be tried in the Netherlands.
	   Libya agreed in principle, but has demanded negotiations to
ensure the suspects' legal rights and safety. The United States and
Britain have said the offer is non-negotiable.
	   The Security Council said the sanctions would be suspended when
the suspects were turned over for trial.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A young business executive, distraught over the
impact of Russia's economic crisis, shot his wife and three
children to death and then killed himself, a news agency reported
Saturday.
	   The killings occurred Friday night in Makhachkala, the capital
of the southern republic of Dagestan, about 1,600 kilometers (1,000
miles) south of Moscow.
	   According to ITAR-Tass, the man had been frantic in recent days
over the effect of the economic crisis on his business, with
creditors hounding him to repay debts. The report did not say what
kind of business he ran.

Sakhalin Island engulfed by fires; smoke endangers residents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Firefighters are battling a record number of fires
on Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East, and the island has become
so smoky that medical clinics are dispensing oxygen, a news agency
reported Saturday.
	   There are 57 fires covering more than 10,000 hectares (25,000
acres) of forest on the island, ITAR-Tass said, citing local
forestry officials. It said the situation was aggravated by smoke
blowing onto Sakhalin from the mainland, where fires are also
burning.
	   In the central part of Sakhalin, authorities are considering the
evacuation of children to escape potentially dangerous carbon
monoxide levels generated by the fires, authorities said.
	   Oxygen posts have been opened in medical clinics for residents
who are suffering from shortage of breath. Sakhalin's governor,
Igor Farkhutdinov, has sent a telegram to Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov asking for urgent assistance, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Sakhalin is located off Russia's Pacific coast, about 6,000
kilometers (4,000 miles) east of Moscow.

Pro-democracy party cannot convene parliament, military says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The pro-democracy party that swept
Myanmar's last general elections cannot convene Parliament and its
recent declarations are in blatant violation of the law, the
state-run press said Saturday.
	   The National League for Democracy, headed by Nobel Peace Prize
winner Aung San Suu Kyi, said last week a 10-member committee
representing those elected in the 1990 balloting would act as a
Parliament.
	   The NLD also announced it would regard all laws and regulations
enacted by the military-run regime after Sept. 18 as illegal.
	   But government newspapers described both moves as ``blatant
violations of the law'' and said such a Parliament would not be
allowed to function.
	   The committee, which includes Suu Kyi, was formed Wednesday and
claims to have the mandate of 195 arrested members of parliament to
govern in their name.
	   ``It remains unclear which responsibilities of government this
new committee intends to take over,'' a statement from the
government said Friday. ``Under what constitution will it govern?
Will it defend Myanmar sovereignty? Will it send envoys to other
countries?''
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military
since 1962. Although the NLD won 82 percent of the seats in
Parliament in the 1990 election, the military has never allowed the
assembly to meet.
	   The NLD said Friday the military had arrested another 10 of its
members. That brings the total to 853, including 196 members of
Parliament, detained by the military to prevent the opposition from
convening the assembly.
	   The military is wary, however, of arresting top NLD leaders,
particularly Suu Kyi, because of the international backlash that
this would provoke.

Bangladesh receives first consignment of food aid

<TEXT>
	   CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (AP) _ Workers began unloading 15,000
tons of wheat from the first consignment of international food aid
that arrived Saturday for millions of people displaced by
Bangladesh's worst floods in decades.
	   Donated by the World Food Program, the supply marks the
beginning of the largest relief operation in the U.N. agency's
history, Susan Manuel, its spokesperson in Bangladesh, said.
	   Another 52,000 tons of wheat is expected to reach this
southeastern port city early next month, Manuel said.
	   Last week, the Rome-based WFP launched an international appeal
for dlrs 84 million to donate 356,000 tons of food grains to
Bangladesh, where floods have destroyed an estimated 4 million tons
of rice crop.
	   Bangladesh plans to buy 2.5 million tons of rice from
international market.
	   The WFP grant is part of 1.5 million tons of food grains
Bangladesh expects to receive in foreign aid. The United States has
committed 400,000 tons of wheat to Bangladesh.
	   ``There will be no shortage of food in the aftermath of the
floods,'' Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed said Saturday in a
telephone interview.
	   The monsoon flood waters are receding fast after battering the
delta nation of 124 million people for more than two months. The
deluge killed more than 1,000 people.

German police arrest suspected Bin Laden operative

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bavarian police have arrested a man
described as a close associate of international terrorist Osama bin
Laden, the state Justice Ministry confirmed Saturday.
	   Officials did not disclose the identity of the man, who they
said was arrested near Munich Wednesday afternoon on a tip from
Interpol officials in Washington, a ministry statement said.
	   The ministry said it would confirm the man's identity and
determine what he was doing in Germany.
	   The Washington Post identified the suspect as Mamduh Mahmud
Salim and described him as a top lieutenant and weapons procurer
for bin Laden.
	   The Post said U.S. official have filed charges against him in
New York.
	   The newspaper's sources said Salim was a member of al Qaida, bin
Laden's radical Islamic network. The group has been accused of the
recent U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, but U.S.
officials said they could not say whether Salim was involved in
those attacks.
	   The FBI and CIA assisted Bavarian police in Salim's arrest
Wednesday, the Post said. It said a sealed warrant seeking Salim's
arrest was issued recently in Manhattan.
	   On Thursday, the U.S. government offered a dlrs 2 million reward
for a fugitive charged with killing 12 Americans by helping plan
the explosion in Kenya.
	   The fugitive, identified as Haroun Fazil, was the third suspect
charged publicly in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in the Aug. 7
bombing.

Philippine ship with 443 aboard sinks in storm; two known dead

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Rescuers lowered ropes from
helicopters Saturday to save passengers who survived more than 12
hours in storm-buffeted seas after a Philippine ferryboat sank with
443 people aboard.
	   The coast guard said two people were known dead and at least 232
passengers, many covered with black fuel oil and grease, were
rescued from the Princess of the Orient by naval ships,
helicopters, and a passing fishing boat which picked up 14 people.
	   Bodies of the two were recovered _ one washed ashore at a beach
resort and another retrieved at sea, they said.
	   The ship sank in rough seas several hours after it left Manila
for the central city of Cebu. Dozens of relatives waited, some
crying, outside the ship company's office in Cebu for word of
survivors.
	   No foreign names were on the ship's manifest, coast guard
spokesman Joel Garcia said.
	   A crew member told The Associated Press that the ship's cargo
appeared to have suddenly shifted to the left in the heavy seas.
	   ``We did not have any warning,'' he said. ``The passengers were
unaware of what was happening. When they realized what was going
on, it was too late.'' The crew member did not provide his name.
	   Tomas Banzon, 25, a survivor picked up by the fishing boat, said
he was sleeping in the ship's economy section on the top deck at
about 10 p.m. (1400 GMT) when he heard shouting and felt his bed
tilting.
	   He put on a life jacket, rushed outside and jumped into the
water, swimming quickly away to escape the ship's suction as it
sank, he said.
	   ``People were shouting, crying, calling out names,'' he said.
``I wanted to save them but I couldn't do anything.'' He said he
floated in the rough seas until about 4 a.m. (2000 GMT), when he
was picked up by the fishing boat.
	   Geronimo Socrates, the skipper of the fishing boat, said he had
difficulty maneuvering the boat to the survivors because of the big
waves.
	   ``They were very scared. One of them clutched me and did not let
go. I told him, `Stay calm, we will save all of you.'''
	   Sulpicio Lines, which owns the ship, said it left Manila about 8
p.m. (1200 GMT) Friday for Cebu.
	   A few hours later it reported it was listing near Fortune island
off Batangas province, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) south of
Manila, and lost radio contact with its office in Manila around
12:30 a.m. Saturday (1630 GMT Friday), the company told naval
authorities.
	   In another contact from the ship, a military colonel on board
called his aide in Manila by cellular telephone late Friday and
desperately asked for help, his aide said.
	   The company initially reported there were 402 people aboard the
ship but later raised the number to 443, with 351 passengers and 92
crew members.
	   Tropical storm Vicki, with 75 kilometer (45 mile) per hour
winds, was located about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of
Manila late Friday, weather reports said.
	   A storm warning raised Friday prohibited ships of less than 500
tons from sailing but did not apply to the 13,000-ton Princess of
the Orient, Garcia said.
	   The storm also caused heavy flooding in many parts of the Manila
area.
	   Ferries are the main mode of transportation among the
Philippines' more than 7,000 islands.
	   In 1987, the Philippines suffered the world's worst peacetime
shipping disaster when the ferry Dona Paz collided with a tanker,
killing 4,341 people.

Defending champions back in grand final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Defending champions Adelaide will
meet North Melbourne in the Australian Football League grand final
Sept. 26 after embarrassing the Western Bulldogs by 68 points on
Saturday.
	   Adelaide blitzed the Bulldogs with a 13-goal first half and won
the Australian Rules football semifinal 24.17 (161) to 13.15 (93).
	   North Melbourne was first through to the grand final when it
beat Melbourne 17.12 (114) to 12.12 (84) Friday.
	   Adelaide midfielder Andrew McLeod booted seven goals while
center half-forward Matthew Robran played one of his best games for
the Crows, finishing with six majors.
	   It was a disappointing performance from the Western Bulldogs who
were favorites to win after finishing second after the
home-and-away season and having a break last weekend.
	   Adelaide led by 34 points at halftime although the Bulldogs made
a spirited start to the third quarter when they cut the deficit to
23 points after booting the opening two goals.
	   But a seven-goal unanswered run through the third and fourth
quarters ensured the Crows victory.
	   They will attempt to be the first team to win back-to-back
premierships since Hawthorn in 1988-89.
	   It's also the second year in a row that Adelaide has knocked the
Bulldogs out of the premiership race in the semifinals.
	   Bulldogs forward Paul Hudson finished with five goals, although
three came in the last quarter when defeat was inevitable.
	   On Friday, North Melbourne increased its lead at every break
Friday to score its 30-point win.
	   It was North Melbourne's 11th consecutive victory, earning it a
place in its second grand final in three seasons. (djp)

Nervous Asian stock markets likely to fall further
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Asia's stock markets are likely in for another
week of jittery, pessimistic trading, although a lift on the U.S
market could give share prices a boost.
	   ``We're not out of the woods yet,'' said Chia Yew Boon, head of
research at Santander Investment Securities in Singapore.
	   Asian markets will probably fall further in the coming week,
Chia said.
	   Bleakness was the dominant mood on Asian markets Friday, when
most markets from Hong Kong to the Philippines and Singapore ended
lower, taking their cue from on fall on Wall Street.
	   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average recouped some of its
losses, gaining 21.89 to 7,895.66 points. In Tokyo, the benchmark
Nikkei rose 123.98 points, or 0.89 percent, after dropping to a
12-year low the previous day.
	   This week, along with Wall Street, developments closer to home,
including the prospect of substantial banking reform in Japan, will
continue to influence the markets, analysts said.
	   The Japanese ruling party and the opposition struck a deal
Friday on a key package of bills to start cleaning up the massive
bad debts in the banking sector. Most of the bills' measures are
expected to pass next month.
	   Financial reform in Japan is ``the critical thing in Asia right
now,'' said Chris Wood, chief strategist for Santander in Hong
Kong.
	   Friday's agreement increases the likelihood that some banks will
be liquidated rather than rescued, and may provide a boost to the
nervous Asian markets in the coming days.
	   Market players also have their eyes on U.S. interest rates.
	   Investors were disappointed last week when U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments seemed to dash immediate hopes
for a coordinated lowering of interest rates by industrialized
countries.
	   Market players had looked for coordinated global action to stem
the crisis of confidence spreading through emerging markets, where
Brazil was the latest victim.
	   The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's largest, closed
down 4.8 percent on Thursday after dropping as much as 10 percent
in early trading.
	   But hopes remained for a lower U.S. rate, analysts said.
	   ``Next week again, investors will be trying to figure out
whether or not Alan Greenspan is going to cut the Fed rate,'' said
Chia. ``That's the main attention.''
	   Others were optimistic that bargain-hunters may help bring about
some recovery.
	   Foreign investors ``will start moving to Asian regional markets
like Singapore'' in the near future, said Najeeb Jarhom, head of
research at Fraser-AMMB in Singapore.
	   Singapore rallied earlier in the week, enjoying a 5 percent
surge in the benchmark Straits Times Index on Wednesday before
relinquishing some of its gains as global sentiment soured.

	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II, ever the
unflappable guest, strolled through a steaming hot outdoor market
along the Brunei River on Saturday.
	   Nodding at the sellers of smelly dried fish and chili peppers,
inquiring about tropical fruit and odd-looking vegetables, the
queen was completely composed beneath her yellow straw hat.
	   Everyone else, including her three ladies in waiting, were
wilting under the blazing sun.
	   ``She's a bit older, but she still has a beauty of her own, a
charisma,'' said Nor Salam, a 34-year-old accountant who rushed to
the Tamu market for a peek at the queen.
	   Nor said she met the queen during her last visit to this tiny
rain forest on the northern tip of Borneo in 1972, when Nor was
just 8 and Brunei was still a British protectorate.
	   Bruneians adore the British and hold little animosity toward
having been colonized by them for nearly a century.
	   ``It was a blessing in disguise,'' said Nor. ``When they were
here, they taught us how to run a country.''
	   Since Brunei gained full independence in 1984, the tiny
Southeast Asian sultanate of 312,000 people has become one of the
richest in the world. Sultan Hassanal Bolkia, whose wealth is
estimated at some dlrs 37 billion, was educated in Britain and is
an honorary general in the British Army.
	   Dozens of British Brownies in yellow uniforms and brown sashes
waved British Union Jacks and cheered the queen as she gathered
their flowers and chatted.
	   ``She talked to us,'' squealed Corrina Bradley, 7. ``She said
the flowers were very nice and that she thought Brunei was a very
nice place.''
	   The queen took special interest in one market stall selling
collector plates, including a commemorative dish of the wedding of
Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana.
	   ``Somebody's a collector,'' she commented pleasantly,
disregarding what Buckingham Palace would consider a serious breach
of protocol.
	   Perhaps she knew the vendor likely intended the plate as a
gesture of kindness, not a bitter reminder of her son's divorce and
Diana's death.
	   British Foreign Minister Robin Cook bought himself a jar of
honey, noting that's his personal weakness.
	   The British photographers continued their relentless pursuit of
Cook's new wife, Gaynor Regan, his former aide for whom he recently
left his wife of 28 years, causing a tabloid scandal.
	   The market visit was a far cry from the elegant gala at the
sultan's grand palace Friday night, a state banquet set in the
majestic splendor befitting two of the world's oldest dynasties,
hosted by the sultan and his two wives.
	   The queen's press secretary said that while Buckingham Palace
was trying to present the queen as more accessible to ordinary
people, in the much-admired style of Princess Diana, she still had
an obligation to represent the 1,000-year-old British monarchy.
	   The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, wrap up their four-day
visit Sunday and fly to neighboring Malaysia, another former
British colony.
	   The queen will visit athletes competing in the 16th Commonwealth
Games and, as the head of the Commonwealth, officially close the
games Monday.

Iran and Taliban in dangerous faceoff along Afghan border

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ These are menacing days along the
border between Iran and Afghanistan.
	   Dozens of Iranian tanks growl across the sand, while helicopter
gunships chatter in the sky and some 200,000 soldiers hold
maneuvers to hone their military skills.
	   They are cheered on from Iran's cities, where people mass daily
to protest the killing of Iranian diplomats by the Taliban
religious army that controls much of Afghanistan. Screams of
``death to the Taliban'' and calls for revenge fill the air.
	   Across the border, an estimated 10,000 Taliban militiamen have
dug in. And their leaders vow to retaliate against any assault by
attacking Iranian cities with Russian-made Scud missiles _ the same
weapon Iraq fired at Israeli and Saudi Arabian cities during the
Gulf War.
	   The options are reduced to two: diplomacy or war.
	   While diplomatic initiatives have been slow in coming, the
military option seems the least tenable.
	   Iran only has to look to recent history to see the risks in
invading Afghanistan. The Soviet Union's Red Army marched in to
bolster a tottering Marxist regime, only to slink back out in 1989
after losing a 10-year war with Islamic militants.
	   Despite its saber rattling, Iran's government can't be eager to
see its troops mired in a guerrilla war with Taliban soldiers
hardened by four years of fighting that have put them in control of
most of Afghanistan.
	   The Iranians could not expect much help from their Shiite Muslim
allies inside Afghanistan, who are hemmed in by Taliban forces in
Bamiyan province hundreds of miles (kilometers) away in the center
of the country.
	   ``Even if Iran could take Herat (in eastern Afghanistan) then
what?'' asked Pakistan's former interior minister, Nasrullah Babaar
_ the man Iran and many Western governments believe fathered the
Taliban movement.
	   ``If they then tried to move out from there, they would get
bogged down like the Russians,'' he said. ``They would be stuck
trying to defend themselves in Herat. It's not possible.''
	   Another option is to arm and supply Shiite Afghans who have
sought refuge in Iran and send them home to fight the Taliban,
whose soldiers are mostly Sunni Muslims.
	   Some people say Iran may settle for punitive air strikes, but
they fear that would cause the Taliban to retaliate with Scud
missiles and possibly escalate the conflict into a ground war.
	   Babaar, a former general in the Pakistani army, said a war
between Iran and Afghanistan could engulf the entire region.
	   He sketched a possible scenario:
	   The tribesmen of northeastern Pakistan, who are ethnic Pashtuns
like most of the Taliban's militiamen, take up arms on the side of
the Taliban. India, which is on friendly terms with Iran and is an
old enemy of Pakistan, steps up military activity against Muslim
separatists in the Kashmir region to divert Pakistan's attention.
	   ``And when we (Pakistanis) begin crying, China comes to our
aid,'' Babaar said.
	   On the diplomatic front progress has been slow.
	   Thus far it is limited to calls for emergency meetings,
including a surprising one set for Monday between Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and the Iranian foreign minister, Kamal
Kharrazi.
	   What the Iranian government needs is a face-saving gesture from
the Taliban to quell the cries for revenge at home and an
appearance of triumph that would allow it to pull back its troops.
	   Taliban leaders don't seem ready to concede one.
	   The movement's reclusive leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, said he
would not apologize for the killings of eight Iranian diplomats and
a journalist, something that would soothe Iranian tempers.
	   He also refuses to hand over 50 or so Iranians that Taliban
troops are holding, unless Iran turns over former Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani and Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik _ the man Mullah
Omar believes ordered the massacre of 2,000 captured Taliban
soldiers last year.
	   For many, including the chief U.N. negotiator in the region,
Lakshmi Brahimi, the key to peace is ending the flow of arms into
Afghanistan_ from Pakistan to the Taliban and from Iran to the
Taliban's opponents
	   Otherwise, even averting a war between Iran and Afghanistan will
not stop the bloodletting inside Afghanistan.
	   But both countries deny they are aiding Afghan factions, and
U.N. diplomats have been unable to slow the flood of weapons.

Australia wins two shooting golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two Australian women won shooting
gold medals and India's Jaspal Rana defended his title in
center-fire pistol marksmanship in a tiebreaking shoot-off at the
Commonwealth Games Saturday.
	   Susan McCready, a 17-year-old student, won the women's sport
rifle three-position event, beating defending champion Sharon Bowes
of Canada 667.3 to 666.4. Malaysia's Roslina Bakar won the bronze
with 666.3.
	   For Australia's Annemarie Forder and India's Rana, Saturday's
golds were their second of these games. Both had won earlier in
pairs events.
	   Forder won the air pistol gold with 480.6, with pairs teammate
Christine Trefry taking the silver with 476.9 and New Zealand's
Tania Corrigan winning the bronze with 476.3.
	   Rana needed a shoot-off after he and South African Allan
McDonald tied at 581 points. Rana won 149-145, leaving McDonald
with the silver medal. Canada's John Rochon took the bronze with
576.

Malaysian prime minister warns former deputy speeches are
</HEADLINE>
unacceptable
 &UR; AP Photos KB101-103

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A brother and a friend of
Malaysia's out-spoken former deputy prime minister told a court
Saturday that he had sodomized them, increasing the likelihood of
his arrest.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, who was fired as deputy prime minister earlier
this month, told The Associated Press that the confessions were
obtained ``certainly under duress.'' He said the men had been
denied access to family lawyers since they were arrested by police
for questioning.
	   Anwar has been accused of committing unlawful sex acts, leaking
state secrets and abusing his powers. He has denied the
allegations.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has ruled Malaysia for 17
years, has accused Anwar, his former heir-apparent, of ``low
morals.''
	   In Saturday papers, Mahathir was quoted as saying Anwar's public
speeches Friday _ boldly calling for the prime minister's
resignation _ are illegal.
	   Since his dismissal, Anwar has been on a nationwide campaign
calling for reform of the judiciary, an end to political
corruption, and in the last few days, Mahathir's resignation.
	   Growing crowds have shouted support in unheard-of challenges to
the authority of the prime minister and the government's powers of
summary arrest.
	   Anwar's adopted brother, two friends and two former private
secretaries _ all men _ have been arrested since Sept. 6 as part of
a police investigation against Anwar.
	   The allegations, made public by police, were based on a book
called ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot be Prime Minister.''
	   None of the detainees had been heard from until Saturday, when
two appeared in Sessions Court and confessed that they had allowed
Anwar to sodomize them. The national Bernama news agency said each
was sentenced to six months in prison.
	   Anwar has accused Mahathir, 73, of instigating the accusations
to discredit him in this conservative Muslim country, where movies
are censored to remove all acts of affection except kissing, and
magazines are banned if they contain pictures of women's breasts.
	   Anwar, 51, married with six children, alleges that he had become
too attractive as an alternative to Mahathir.
	   Local journalists were surprised that the Bernama report, likely
to be printed Sunday in newspapers throughout the country,
described graphically the act of sodomy in its story on the court
case.
	   Veteran reporters said they had never seen such language in the
local press.
	   Anwar had said that on Sunday he would hold a public rally in
the capital's Merdeka, or Freedom, Square at the same time
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II is visiting.
	   Sukma Dermawan, 37, a businessman who is Anwar's adopted
brother, was taken away by police without explanation on Sept. 6.
	   Bernama, the government news agency, reported Saturday that he
said Anwar had sodomized him in April in his room at the deputy
prime minister's official residence.
	   Bernama said that Anwar's friend and sometime speech writer,
Munawar Anees, 51, said he had sex with Anwar at his private
residence in 1993. Anees was arrested Sept. 14 under the Internal
Security Act, which allows indefinite imprisonment without trial.

 &UR; Pope urges faithful to spread Christian message &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHIAVARI, Italy (AP)_ On the edge of the sea, under a
crystalline blue sky, Pope John Paul II on Saturday urged his flock
to spread a message of love and faith.
	   Around 70,000 were present for the pope's open-air Mass in the
little resort town of Chiavari, south of Genoa.
	   The pontiff was in the second day of a three-day pastoral trip
to northern Italy. His next stop was Brescia, near Lake Garda. He
was to return to Rome Sunday.
	   Although he is stooped with age and walks slowly, the
78-year-old pontiff was in fine form, pink-cheeked, bright-eyed and
clearly enjoying close contact with the faithful.
	   At a meeting in the town cathedral with nuns, priests and
seminarians Friday, he gave a jaunty wave with his cane and beamed.
The nuns beamed warmly back, kissing his hand as he passed through
the crowd.
	   Chiavari spared no effort in welcoming the pope.
	   A brilliant, crackling fireworks display in his honor brightened
the night sky Friday. Thousands of people lined the streets waving
papal flags whenever the popemobile passed by. Local artisans
labored for months to build the turquoise, blue and white altar on
the bay where he celebrated Mass from an elaborate crimson and gold
throne.
	   In his homily, John Paul spoke of the importance of grassroots
Christianity and of reinvigorating the faith. Everyone, he said, is
Christ's disciple.
	   ``In the community, this means to carry each others' burdens, to
share, to collaborate, to feel responsible for one another,'' he
said.

Storm floods more Philippine towns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN FERNANDO, Philippines (AP) _ More towns were flooded as a
tropical storm drenched much of the northern Philippines Saturday,
killing at least 11 people and forcing thousands of people to flee
rising floodwaters.
	   The storm also whipped up large waves that sank a ferryboat
carrying more than 400 people south of Manila before dawn Saturday.
	   By midafternoon, the navy reported 267 people had been rescued
and two were confirmed dead. Others were still missing.
	   In the Manila suburb of Marikina, police reported four members
of a family were killed when their house was buried in tons of mud
loosened by the rain.
	   Five people drowned in floodwaters in Pangasinan province
northwest of the Philippine capital, police said.
	   In the Central Luzon region north of Manila, more than 223,600
people in six provinces were affected by the floodwaters, according
to Florita Villar, regional director of the Department of Social
Welfare and Development.
	   Another 33,666 people in eight towns were affected in
Pangasinan, the Office of Civil Defense reported.
	   More than 2,627 people in metropolitan Manila were evacuated to
temporary shelters in government schools.
	   Adelaido Manabat, executive director of the Provincial Disaster
Coordinating Council of Pampanga, the hardest hit province, said
floodwaters destroyed a 150-meter (500-foot) section of an earthen
dike in Lubao town.
	   Police were forced to close a flooded road to the Subic Bay
Freeport late Friday and opened it only to large trucks early
Saturday.
	   Weathermen reported that Tropical Storm Vicki, which was
stationary above the South China Sea northwest of Manila overnight,
had moved east toward the mountain city of Baguio at 10 a.m. (0200
GMT) Saturday and weakened into a tropical depression.

Hart retains New Zealand coaching job

	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand rugby union coach
John Hart escaped the axe Saturday and received a vote of
confidence from his employers after the worst year in All Black
test history.
	   The decision means Hart, who watched the All Blacks lose a
record five consecutive test matches to close the season, will
coach New Zealand in next year's World Cup.
	   Hart had a seven-hour meeting with the New Zealand Rugby
Football Union's (NZRFU) board Saturday. He emerged from the
marathon session saying he was ``tired, but obviously delighted''
at having retained his position for the fourth and final year of
his contract.
	   The NZRFU considered three reports on the All Blacks year _ two
unsatisfactory wins over sub-standard England followed by the five
successive defeats to Australia and South Africa _ from Hart, All
Blacks manager and NZRFU board member Mike Banks and the union's
own rugby services division.
	   NZRFU chairman Rob Fisher said the decision to back Hart didn't
come to a vote but was made by consensus among the nine board
members.
	   ``John has the full support of the board,'' Fisher, a strong
Hart supporter, said after the meeting.
	   One of the board members, New York-based Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi
advertising chief Kevin Roberts, took part in the meeting by video
link.
	   Whether Hart should retain the coaching job has polarized the
New Zealand rugby public, with wide speculation going into the
meeting that as many as six of the nine board members were in favor
of dumping him.
	   Both Fisher and Hart were sketchy on specifics which had been
discussed Saturday.
	   There will be further meetings with NZRFU chief executive David
Moffett in about two weeks to iron out details of changes to the
All Blacks structure and planning for next year.
	   That almost certainly means Hart will spend more time coaching
next year, after handing over many of those duties to two new
assistant coaches this year, former All Blacks Peter Sloane and
Wayne Smith.
	   Hart was delighted to have the board's backing and believed he
had received a good hearing.
	   ``Obviously what I had to do today was show the union that we
had in place the strategies for the future in terms of building on
a disappointing season in 1998,'' he said.
	   He described the criticism he has received in recent weeks as
`like a public execution.''
	   ``I understand just how committed this country is to the game,
how important the All Blacks are. It's only natural there will be a
lot of debate and conjecture.''
	   ``It's been a difficult time but I believe the board has handled
it in a professional manner.''
	   Hart said the factors which contributed to the All Blacks' bad
year were a big injury toll, poor goal kicking, the loss of several
experienced players and some selection errors.
	   ``We acknowledge we got some selections wrong,'' said Hart. ``We
stuck to some players for too long. But we've got a really good
base coming out of 1998, in terms of base of talent and it's
important we build on that talent.''
	   Next year the All Blacks will play home tests against France and
Western Samoa, along with the Tri-Nations home-and-away series
against Australia and South Africa before the World Cup in Britain.

Sick of Kohl, German voters want change _ but not too much change

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The prevailing mood heading into Germany's
national election next Sunday boils down to this, a white
spray-painted scrawl across a campaign billboard in the center of
town: ``The Fat One must go.''
	   That would be Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose serious bulk has
given postwar Germany one of its most enduring symbols. Everything
about Kohl represents stability, from his weight _ at least 250
pounds (113 kilos) and playfully claimed by the man himself to be a
``state secret'' _ to his 16 years in office, longer than any other
Western leader.
	   Stability for Germans is one of those traits that defines
national character, like style for the French, or, in the recent
climate, truth-seeking for Americans. The world, too, loves a
stable Germany, particularly Europe, with the devastation caused by
Hitler in the not-so-distant past and the uncertainties of European
monetary union in the near future.
	   Kohl's hearty statesmanship has given Germans stability in
spades. And now _ perhaps because Germans once again feel
comfortable with their place in the world _ some of Germany's 60.5
million voters are thinking about change.
	   But thinking is different from voting.
	   Gerhard Schroeder, the charismatic state governor challenging
Kohl, presents himself as the voice of change, even though he has
little specific to say about what he might change or how he might
do it. His vagueness can suggest a shiftiness.
	   Despite the mocking graffiti, The Fat One could still win.
	   ``People are fed up with his face. They can't stand him
anymore,'' says Dirk Rumberg, political director of the Bertelsmann
Foundation think tank. Then he points to the polls, where Kohl's
Christian Democrats are gaining fast on Schroeder's Social
Democrats.
	   ``People say, `We don't want Kohl, but do we really want
Schroeder?' Many people step back and say, `Not really.'''
	   The Kohl-Schroeder race is, in large part, about style, about
Schroeder's fresh face and relative youth _ he is 54 _ compared to
the 68-year-old chancellor's imposing stature.
	   The campaign also is about domestic politics, as opposed to the
international diplomacy that defines Kohl's greatest achievements.
	   Under Kohl, Germany has completed much of its painful recovery
from World War II. The conservative chancellor oversaw the merging
of former communist East Germany with the West. He pushed for the
``euro'' common currency, binding Germany tighter to its neighbors.
He sent German soldiers overseas for the first time since the war,
as U.N. peacekeeping troops.
	   Kohl has a doctorate in political history. Mindful of his own
role in that history he helped make Germany benign as a world
power. But his achievements abroad may have been at the expense of
Germans at home. Unemployment is at a postwar high, and Germans are
well aware that when the numbers started climbing two years ago,
Kohl failed to solve the problem.
	   Enter Schroeder, who long ago shook off his '60s leftist
radicalism to become a business-courting governor of Lower Saxony
state. He cultivates a modern, vigorous image, shaped by slim
Italian suits and a head of thick brown hair he denies dyeing _
even though his eyebrows are gray.
	   Schroeder has his appetites, like Kohl. He's on wife No. 4. He
gave up alcohol for the campaign but has yet to forsake cigars. He
also sounds a little like Kohl, in that his campaign platform
mostly supports keeping Germany just as it is.
	   ``We're not going to do everything differently,'' a Schroeder
campaign poster says. ``We're just going to do many things
better.''
	   Schroeder talks about change, yet the most specific changes he
proposes, ironically, would reverse social welfare cuts _ some of
the few recent economic reforms Kohl has managed to push through.
	   Above all, Schroeder is a populist. Like his heroes Bill Clinton
and Britain's Tony Blair, he shifted his leftist party to the
center. He pushes ``The Third Way,'' the blending of social
responsibility with economic pragmatism. Yet his lack of concrete
plans leaves some people wondering what he really stands for.
	   Clues lie in his proposed Cabinet choices, who talk tough where
Schroeder keeps quiet.
	   Jost Stollmann, the millionaire businessman tapped for economics
minister, enraged unions by proposing to eliminate laws on store
hours. Suggested cultural minister Michael Naumann sparked a
similar furor by criticizing plans for a national Holocaust
memorial.
	   These are domestic issues. Foreign policy is another matter, and
Schroeder knows he can't beat Kohl on the international stage. His
take on foreign policy is to say, ``We don't intend to
fundamentally change foreign policy,'' graciously _ cleverly _
acknowledging Kohl's strength.
	   Kohl knows his strengths, too, and pushes them out on the stump.
``Never again will we shoot at the French! Never again will we
invade our Polish neighbors!'' he thundered during a recent speech,
declarations that sound a little dated but nonetheless remind
Germans of his role in securing peace and stability.
	   World expertise may help Kohl with voters. The euro, which kicks
in Jan. 1, is his pet project, and he's reassuringly on top of the
Russian crisis, advising President Boris Yeltsin by telephone.
	   ``This is a society that aches and gnaws and gnashes its teeth
at anything new that comes our way,'' says Thomas Kielinger, a
political analyst. ``This is not one of these societies that is
open to change.
	   ``And now we have an enormous change coming: the euro. Given the
uncertainties around this big social and monetary experiment,
people will be less inclined to trade horses'' _ meaning
chancellors.

Possible surprise: A vote split may force Grand Coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-Germany-The Fat One &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   What if Germans are equally divided in their hopes for change
and stability?
	   A close split in votes for the Gerhard Schroder's Social
Democrats and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats could
give Germany something it hasn't seen since 1969: A Grand
Coalition, in which the two major parties govern jointly.
	   Kohl, in that case, says he would step down.
	   The chancellor job goes to the party with the most votes. Even
if Christian Democrats come out on top, Kohl says he would never
lead in conjunction with the opposition. His protege, 56-year-old
Wolfgang Schaeuble, likely would step in, taking what some people _
even members of Kohl's party _ think is his rightful spot in a new
generation of conservative leadership.
	   Then again, Kohl has changed his mind before, like in 1994
during the previous election. He said it would be his last.

OSCE delegation arrives in Albania to seek end to crisis

prosecutor's comments in newspaper interview; ADDS byline

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A top delegation of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe arrived Saturday in Albania to
tackle the crisis sparked by rioting this week that threatened to
topple the government.
	   Ex-President Sali Berisha's followers have demanded the
resignation of Prime Minister Fatos Nano since last weekend's
assassination of a popular opposition figure.
	   Azem Hajdari's death set off the rioting Sunday and Monday, in
which mobs briefly seized government buildings, state television
and Nano's office.
	   An OSCE delegation, led by Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek, planned to meet Nano and Albanian President Rexhep Meidani
``with a view to restoring stability, political cooperation and
good governance,'' said a statement Friday by the OSCE, a European
alliance that has spearheaded international efforts in the Balkans.
	   Sources in Tirana said the delegation also would hold talks with
Berisha, the opposition Democratic Party leader.
	   ``My message is very clear. The European Community and all
international organizations are concerned about the situation in
Albania,'' Geremek said at Tirana's airport Saturday.
	   On Friday, the Albanian parliament voted overwhelmingly to lift
Berisha's immunity from prosecution, clearing the way for his
arrest and prosecution for allegedly trying to overthrow the
government.
	   Berisha responded he would continue to oppose Nano's government
``from whatever cell they put me in.''
	   Western powers want a ``cooling off period'' before any attempt
to arrest Berisha, fearing his detention would make him a martyr to
his supporters and further inflame tensions.
	   Instability in Albania is considered a threat to spread through
other parts of the volatile Balkans. Berisha has publicly supported
Albanian rebels seeking independence in neighboring Kosovo province
of Yugoslavia.
	   Chief prosecutor Arben Rakipi said in a newspaper interview
published Saturday that lifting Berisha's immunity was necessary to
allow the investigation of the rioting to proceed. He told the Koha
Jone independent daily newspaper he expected to question Berisha
early next week, but left open the possibility of a formal arrest.
	   In its statement Friday, the OSCE said it was ``imperative to
bring to justice'' those responsible for last weekend's
assassination of Hajdari. Berisha accused Nano of ordering
Hajdari's killing to try to destroy the opposition, while Western
officials say they believe the shooting death resulted from a
personal feud.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The league champions for the last
two seasons _ Adelaide and North Melbourne _ will play in next
week's Australian Football League grand final after Adelaide easily
beat the Western Bulldogs on Saturday.
	   For the second successive year the Crows denied the Bulldogs
what would have been their first Australian Rules football grand
final appearance since 1961.
	   Next Saturday, Adelaide will have the chance to become the first
team since Hawthorn in 1989 to win back-to-back premierships.
	   Last year, the Crows sneaked into the final by two points after
trailing by five goals at halftime. Saturday's rematch wasn't even
a contest as Adelaide thrashed the Bulldogs 24.17 (161) to 13.15
(93) before a crowd of 67,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
	   Adelaide led by 34 points at halftime although the Bulldogs made
a spirited start to the third quarter when they cut the deficit to
23 points after booting the opening two goals.
	   But a seven-goal unanswered run through the third and fourth
quarters ensured the Crows victory.
	   The heroes for the Crows were Andrew McLeod, who booted seven
goals, and Matthew Robran, who had five goals from center half
forward.
	   Adelaide will be confronted by a North Melbourne side that not
only is searching for its second flag in three seasons but goes
into the game having won 11 straight matches.
	   On Friday, North Melbourne beat Melbourne 17.12 (114) to 12.12
(84) in the other semifinal.
	   ``We will have to be better than last year to win it again,''
Adelaide coach Malcolm Blight said. ``We will have to do it tougher
than we did last year.''

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A bomb exploded inside a market near the
city of Tiaret, killing at least 29 people and injuring 110 others,
hospital sources said.
	   The attack was announced in a brief statement from Algerian
security forces. The statement said seven of the injured were in
serious condition.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bomb
which went off about 5 p.m. (1800 GMT) Friday.
	   Residents of Tiaret, reached by telephone, said the security
forces were searching the area, about 310 kilometers (190 miles)
southeast of the capital Algiers. The hospital sources and the
residents spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   No further details were immediately available on the attack.
	   The explosion was the latest in an upsurge in violence in
Algeria that has occurred following the decision by President
Liamine Zeroual last week to step down and call early elections.
	   Zeroual, a former general, has been unable to put a stop to
violence that erupted in 1992 after an Islamic insurgency broke out
after the military canceled parliamentary elections an Islamic
party was set to win.
	   At least 75,000 people have been killed in violence since then.
	   This week, a U.N. fact-finding team released the results of an
inquiry conducted this summer. The group condemned what it called
extremism that has spurred the violence, but it also called on the
government to exercise greater control on the security forces,
which have been accused of carrying out some of the attacks.
	   The report was immediately criticized by the human rights group
Amnesty International, which called it a whitewash and said the
U.N. team had failed to address key human rights abuses.

Akebono, Musashimaru in four-way lead at 6-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hawaiian wrestlers yokozuna (grand champion)
Akebono and ozeki (champion) Musashimaru both added another victory
to remain in a four-way lead at 6-1 Saturday, the seventh day in
the Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   Also in the lead are two yokozunas Wakanohana and his brother
Takanohana.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan, threw down sekiwake (junior champion)
Takatoriki sideways at the ringside. Takatoriki fell to 3-4.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, forced out No. 1 maegashira
Tochiazuma (1-6) with a series of hand thrusts.
	   Wakanohana rolled No. 4 maegashira Aogiyama (2-5) on the ring
after surviving a push on his neck that almost knocked him down.
	   Takanohana stood like a wall against No. 3 maegashira Tamakasuga
(1-6) at the ringside, then gave a decisive push to send him out.
	   No. 6 maegashira Tochinonada suffered his second defeat as his
knee touched the ground first, throwing himself on top of No. 10
maegashira Higonoumi (4-3) to push out the opponent.
	   In other major bouts, No. 5 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian
Batbayar Davaa, tripped No. 2 maegashira Minatofuji, knocking him
down backwards. Kyokushuzan is 3-4 and Minatofuji remained winless.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho (3-4), or Mongolian Tsevegnyam
Nyamjav, shoved out No. 3-ranked Susanoumi (2-5).
	   No. 13-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
slapped down Daishi (3-4) for his fifth victory against two
defeats.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 7-ranked Hoshiandesu
(2-2), or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez, was pushed out by
top-ranked Tochinoiwa.
	   In the second-highest junior division of sandanme, No. 6-ranked
Kyokutenzan, or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, shoved out
equal-ranked Wakasagara for his third victory against one loss.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Factory workers protest in northwest China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ About 300 factory workers staged a daylong sit-in
at the gate to a city hall in northwestern Ningxia demanding back
pay for the last eight months, a human rights group said Saturday.
	   The workers decided to hold the protest Friday, in the
provincial capital, Yingchuan, after an effort to get the
government to mediate with factory managers failed, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   It said the protesters gathered outside the government office in
the morning, preventing both foot and vehicular traffic from
entering or leaving the compound.
	   No violence was reported, and after enduring heavy rains for
much of the day, the group dispersed by late afternoon.
	   The workers, from the Shizuishan City Electrochemical Factory,
had grown desperate after not receiving any pay all year, the
report said.
	   The protesters vowed to return on Oct. 1, China's national day
holiday, to continue their demonstration.
	   Government officials were not immediately available on the
weekend for comment.
	   Worker protests have sprung up recently in many cities in China
as unprofitable state-run factories have laid off workers or
withheld wages.

Malaysian prime minister warns former deputy speeches are
</HEADLINE>
unacceptable

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A brother and a friend of
Malaysia's outspoken former deputy prime minister told a court
Saturday that he had sodomized them, increasing the likelihood of
his arrest.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, who was fired as deputy prime minister earlier
this month, told The Associated Press that the confessions were
obtained ``certainly under duress.'' He said the men had been
denied access to family lawyers since they were arrested by police
for questioning.
	   Anwar has been accused of committing unlawful sex acts, leaking
state secrets and abusing his powers. He has denied the
allegations.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has ruled Malaysia for 17
years, has accused Anwar, his former heir-apparent, of ``low
morals.''
	   In Saturday papers, Mahathir was quoted as saying Anwar's public
speeches Friday _ boldly calling for the prime minister's
resignation _ are illegal.
	   Since his dismissal, Anwar has been on a nationwide campaign
calling for reform of the judiciary, an end to political
corruption, and in the last few days, Mahathir's resignation.
	   Growing crowds have shouted support in unheard-of challenges to
the authority of the prime minister and the government's powers of
summary arrest.
	   Anwar's adopted brother, two friends and two former private
secretaries _ all men _ have been arrested since Sept. 6 as part of
a police investigation against Anwar.
	   The allegations, made public by police, were based on a book
called ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot be Prime Minister.''
	   None of the detainees had been heard from until Saturday, when
two appeared in Sessions Court and confessed that they had allowed
Anwar to sodomize them. The national Bernama news agency said each
was sentenced to six months in prison.
	   Anwar has accused Mahathir, 73, of instigating the accusations
to discredit him in this conservative Muslim country, where movies
are censored to remove all acts of affection except kissing, and
magazines are banned if they contain pictures of women's breasts.
	   Anwar, 51, married with six children, alleges that he had become
too attractive as an alternative to Mahathir.
	   Local journalists were surprised that the Bernama report, likely
to be printed Sunday in newspapers throughout the country,
described graphically the act of sodomy in its story on the court
case.
	   Veteran reporters said they had never seen such language in the
local press.
	   Anwar had said that on Sunday he would hold a public rally in
the capital's Merdeka, or Freedom, Square at the same time
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II is visiting.
	   Sukma Dermawan, 37, a businessman who is Anwar's adopted
brother, was taken away by police without explanation on Sept. 6.
	   Bernama, the government news agency, reported Saturday that he
said Anwar had sodomized him in April in his room at the deputy
prime minister's official residence.
	   Bernama said that Anwar's friend and sometime speech writer,
Munawar Anees, 51, said he had sex with Anwar at his private
residence in 1993. Anees was arrested Sept. 14 under the Internal
Security Act, which allows indefinite imprisonment without trial.

South Africa claims first cricket gold medal

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ South African captain Shaun
Pollock lifted his young team to the first ever Commonwealth Games
cricket gold medal Saturday as it destroyed a full-strength
Australia by four wickets in the final.
	   Only Steve Waugh, with an unbeaten 90, stood firm against
Pollock's bowling as he claimed 4-19 in Australia's 183 all out.
South Africa reached 184-6.
	   Pollock's first spell of 3-12 removed Mark Waugh (2), Ricky
Ponting (2) and Adam Gilchrist (15), and he broke a 63-run stand
between Steve Waugh and Darren Lehmann (26) in his first over of a
second spell.
	   ``I'm chuffed. We've won the gold and I think the guys have
deserved a good party tonight,'' Pollock said.
	   South Africa, without stars such as Hansie Cronje, Allan Donald,
Jonty Rhodes and Brian McMillan, made a flying start to its run
chase against Australia's first-choice limited overs team.
	   Test opener Andrew Hudson overcame a poor tournament by hitting
36 off 39 and the South Africans were a healthy 73 when he became
the first wicket to fall.
	   Fellow opener Mike Rindel scored a steady 67 and was third out
with just 26 runs needed. Jacques Kallis added 44 and was fifth
down with three runs required, allowing Pollock to the crease. He
hit two runs to level the scores, then got out trying to hit the
winning run over the top.
	   The impressive win was in contrast to the South Africans'
struggle in earlier matches, including a nerve-wracking one wicket
win in the semifinal against Sri Lanka.
	   Australia was the only test playing nation to send its full team
to the 16-side tournament and was favored for the gold medal after
thrashing bronze medalist New Zealand in their semi.
	   Steve Waugh played a defiant innings, finishing the tournament
with 215 runs and having not lost his wicket, but Lehmann was the
only player to give him any support.
	   ``There were a lot of soft dismissals. It's disappointing but we
didn't bat well,'' said Steve Waugh. ``It wasn't a professional
performance and that's what we were looking for.''
	   Earlier Saturday, Malaysia's leading track and field gold medal
hope Yuan Yu Fang was blasted by her coach after getting
disqualified in the 10-kilometer walk final.
	   Australia's Jane Saville stepped out of the shadow of two-time
champion Kerry Saxby-Junna for the first time to claim the gold
medal at Lake Titiwangsa.
	   Saville, 23, took 43 minutes, 59 seconds to complete the walk
after making a decisive break with about one kilometer to go.
	   Saxby-Junna, who won the first women's walk title in Auckland in
1990 and defended it in Victoria 1994, finished with silver. Lisa
Kehler of England was third.
	   Yuan, a former Chinese star recently given Malaysian
citizenship, was disqualified for having two feet off the ground at
the same time. The decisive third warning came 33 minutes into the
race as she was fighting Saville and Saxby-Junna for the lead.
	   ``After the second warning I told her to slow down but she
completely ignored it,'' said coach Wang Lin. ``This is the second
time she did not listen to my instruction. The first was in the
Italy national championship in Milan in April and she was punished
for the same mistake.''
	   Australia's cyclists continued to dominate at the velodrome, as
an equipment failure robbed England of the top ranking in the
qualifying round of the men's 4,000-meter team pursuit.
	   England was on target for the fastest time but Robert Hayles'
chain came off and he had to coast to the line, leaving the team
third behind Australia and New Zealand.
	   Australia's top sprinters, Darryn Hill and world championship
silver medalist Michelle Ferris, both won through to Saturday
night's semifinals with impressive qualifying rides.
	   World champion Lucy Tyler-Sharman returned home to Perth,
Australia, Saturday after her explusion for criticizing team
officials.
	   The main attraction in Saturday's track and field finals will be
the return of England's Diane Modhal four years after she was
banned from the 1994 games.
	   Modhal will face Mozambique's former world champion Maria Mutola
and Mutola's compatriot Argentina Paulino in Saturday night's
final.
	   Daniel Komen, former world record holder in the men's 5,000
meters, is one of three Kenyans looking for a clean sweep of the
medals.
	   Australia got its 61st gold medal Saturday when Annemarie Forder
won the women's air pistol final with a games record of 480.6
points at Langkawi Island.
	   Susan McCready added No. 62 with a games record 667.3 points in
the women's sport rifle final, winning from Sharon Bowes of Canada
and Malaysia's Roslina Bakar.
	   India's Jaspal Rana beat South African Allan McDonald in a
shootout in the men's individual center-fire pistol final to take
the gold.
	   Canadian weightlifter Akos Sandor, 21, took triple gold in the
men's 105-kilogram division. His 167.5-kg snatch eclipsed the old
Commonwealth Games mark by 7.5kg, and his total of 360kg beat the
previous record by 2.5kg. England's Tommy Yule claimed triple
silver while teammate Karl Grant snared a bronze in the clean and
jerk and New Zealander Nigel Avery took bronze in the snatch and
total.

South Africa wins inaugural Commonwealth Games cricket

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with South African victory and innings &QL; 
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Opener Mike Rindel tamed
Australian pacemen and spinners alike Saturday for a flawless 67 as
South Africa defeated favorite Australia by five wickets to win the
gold medal in the inaugural Commonwealth Games cricket tournament.
	   The historic victory overshadowed Australian captain Steve
Waugh's unbeaten 90 that rescued his team from 58 for 4 to 183 all
out. Australia's top order was destroyed by South African captain
Shaun Pollock who took three wickets in his opening spell and
finished with 4-19 off nine overs.
	   But the target of 184 was apparently too small on a dry batter's
wicket that Pollock had judged correctly as he won the toss and
chose to bat second.
	   Putting on the best South African performance in the tournament,
Rindel and Andrew Hudson began with guns blazing as they scored at
a run rate of more than 6 while the required rate was 3.68. Their
batting left in tatters Australia's reputation, built around the
full strength limited overs side it fielded unlike other test
playing countries in the 16-nation tournament.
	   Rindel and Hudson had posted 73 runs by the 10th. At that point,
trying to flick spinner Gavin Robertson, Hudson gave an easy catch
to Michael Bevan at fine leg for 36. He had survived a difficult
catch in the first slip by Mark Waugh in the first over.
	   But the aggression continued as Rindel dispatched the other
spinner, Brad Young, to two consecutive fours in the 13th over.
	   Rindel and new man Jacques Kallis continued to tire out the
Australians under the torrid tropical heat as the fielding
continued to slip. Rindel took two hesitant defense shots to judge
Brad Young when he opened the spin attack in the 8th over. The
third ball he lifted above the bowler's head for a four to bring up
South Africa's 50.
	   He and Kallis shared a 72-run partnership until Rindel was out
to a superb reflex action catch by Mark Waugh off Darren Lehmann at
forward short leg, ending a 2 hour, 15 minute innings of 106 balls
with seven fours.
	   Kallis was caught behind off Lehmann again for 44 with the score
at 181. Next man in was Pollock who leveled the scores but was out
caught by Young trying to hit the winning shot off Lehmann. The
winning run was scored by Dale Benkenstein and South Africa
finished at 184 for 6.
	   Earlier, Pollock shocked Australia, dismissing opener Mark
Waugh, one drop Ricky Ponting and opener Adam Gilchrist in the 3rd,
5th and 9th overs.
	   Waugh stepped in at that stage and began to put together the
innings as seven Australians came to the crease and returned to the
pavilion. He ran out of partners in the last over with three balls
to go.
	   Waugh has scored 215 runs in five innings without losing his
wickets over the past 10 days at the 16-nation cricket
competitions.
	   Waugh opened his account with a square cut that was perfectly
perpendicular to the pitch and he went on to hit five more fours
and two sixes in his 109-ball knock.

Report: Jailed rogue trader Leeson recovering after cancer surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Nick Leeson, the rogue securities trader blamed
for the 1995 collapse of Britain's oldest merchant bank, is
recovering in his prison cell after surgery for colon cancer, The
Straits Times newspaper said Saturday.
	   Leeson's appeal for early release on compassionate grounds was
rejected earlier this week. He is serving a 6 1/2 year sentence on
a fraud and forgery conviction in the collapse of Barings Bank.
	   A Prisons Department spokesman was quoted by The Straits Times
as saying that the appeal was rejected because he was likely to
survive his remaining time in prison.
	   The spokesman was quoted as saying that Leeson is responding
well to a six-month chemotherapy program which began Sept. 7 and
that the cancer had not spread to other organs.
	   Leeson's cancer was detected Aug. 5, and he appealed for an
early release five days later.
	   Doctors removed the tumor last month and have given him a 70
percent chance of survival over the next five years, the official
was quoted as saying.
	   Leeson's London-based lawyer Stephen Pollard said Monday that
Leeson could be released at the end of June 1999 on the basis of
good behavior. His full prison term runs through the end of 2001.
	   Officials at Britain's High Commission in Singapore were not
immediately available for comment Saturday.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Rescuers lowered ropes from
helicopters Saturday to hoist up passengers who survived more than
12 hours in stormy seas after a Philippine ship sank with 430
people aboard. At least two people were killed.
	   The coast guard said 267 people, many covered in black oil from
the ship, were rescued by ships and helicopters after the Princess
of the Orient sank. More than 160 people were missing.
	   Only two bodies had been recovered, they said. One washed ashore
at a beach resort and the other was retrieved at sea.
	   In a radio broadcast, the local governor appealed for help in
saving people still floating in the chilly water.
	   The ship, with a capacity of 3,900 passengers, sank in rough
seas several hours after it left Manila for the central city of
Cebu. Dozens of relatives waited, some crying, outside the ship
company's office in Cebu for word of survivors.
	   A crew member who did not give his name told The Associated
Press that the ship's cargo appeared to have suddenly shifted to
the left in the heavy seas.
	   ``We did not have any warning,'' he said. ``The passengers were
unaware of what was happening. When they realized what was going
on, it was too late.''
	   Tropical Storm Vicki, with 75 kph (45 mph) winds, lay about 320
kilometers (200 miles) northwest of Manila late Friday.
	   Tomas Banzon, 25, a survivor picked up by a fishing boat, said
he was sleeping in the ship's economy section on the top deck at
about 10 p.m. when he heard shouting and felt his bed tilting.
	   He put on a life jacket, rushed outside and jumped into the
water, swimming quickly away to escape the ship's suction as it
sank, he said.
	   ``People were shouting, crying, calling out names,'' he said.
``I wanted to save them but I couldn't do anything.'' He said he
floated in the rough seas until about 4 a.m.
	   Geronimo Socrates, the skipper of the fishing boat, said he had
difficulty maneuvering the boat to the survivors because of the big
waves.
	   ``They were very scared. One of them clutched me and did not let
go. I told him, `Stay calm, we will save all of you.'''
	   Sulpicio Lines, which owns the ship, said it left Manila about 8
p.m. (1200 GMT) Friday for Cebu.
	   A few hours later it reported it was listing near Fortune island
off Batangas province, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) south of
Manila, and lost radio contact with its office in Manila around
12:30 a.m. Saturday, the company told naval authorities.
	   A military colonel on board called his aide in Manila by
cellular telephone late Friday and desperately asked for help, his
aide said.
	   For a second time Saturday, the company revised its count of the
number of people aboard. It said 338 passengers and 92 crew had
actually boarded the ship for a total of 430. No foreign names were
on the ship's manifest, coast guard spokesman Joel Garcia said.
	   A storm warning raised Friday prohibited ships of less than 500
tons from sailing but did not apply to the 13,734-ton Princess of
the Orient, Garcia said.
	   The storm also caused heavy flooding in many parts of the Manila
area.
	   Ships are the main mode of transportation among the Philippines'
more than 7,000 islands.
	   In 1987, the Philippines suffered the world's worst peacetime
shipping disaster when the ferry Dona Paz collided with a tanker,
killing 4,341 people.

Pope urges faithful to spread Christian message

	   CHIAVARI, Italy (AP)_ On the edge of the sea, under a
crystalline blue sky, Pope John Paul II on Saturday urged his flock
to spread a message of love and faith.
	   Around 70,000 were present for the pope's open-air Mass in the
little resort town of Chiavari, south of Genoa.
	   The pontiff was in the second day of a three-day pastoral trip
to northern Italy. His next stop was Brescia, near Lake Garda. He
was to return to Rome Sunday.
	   Although he is stooped with age and walks slowly, the
78-year-old pontiff was in fine form, pink-cheeked, bright-eyed and
clearly enjoying close contact with the faithful.
	   At a meeting in the town cathedral with nuns, priests and
seminarians Friday, he gave a jaunty wave with his cane and beamed.
The nuns beamed warmly back, kissing his hand as he passed through
the crowd.
	   Chiavari spared no effort in welcoming the pope.
	   A brilliant, crackling fireworks display in his honor brightened
the night sky Friday. Thousands of people lined the streets waving
papal flags whenever the popemobile passed by. Local artisans
labored for months to build the turquoise, blue and white altar on
the bay where he celebrated Mass from an elaborate crimson and gold
throne.
	   In his homily, John Paul spoke of the importance of grassroots
Christianity and of reinvigorating the faith. Everyone, he said, is
Christ's disciple.
	   ``In the community, this means to carry each others' burdens, to
share, to collaborate, to feel responsible for one another,'' he
said.

Russia bailing out banks, forms `anti-crisis' group with Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government moved ahead on dual fronts Saturday
to rescue the failing economy, carrying out a complicated bank
bailout and signing an ``anti-crisis'' agreement with neighboring
Ukraine.
	   The Communist Party, meanwhile, held its annual party plenum _
once the central event in the nation's political life _ and its
leader once again called on President Boris Yeltsin to resign.
	   Yeltsin was busy hosting his Ukrainian counterpart, Leonid
Kuchma, whose own country is taking a pounding from the economic
storm lashing Russia. The two leaders agreed to create an
``anti-crisis group'' that will look into ways they can shore up
their economies together.
	   In particular, the two presidents said they would take urgent
measures to to stop a decline in trade between the two countries,
Yeltsin's press service said.
	   The Russian economy is at a near standstill after the events of
the past month, during which the ruble has been devalued, the
country has defaulted on its foreign loans and has changed
governments.
	   The new government, under Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, began
to formulate an economic program in the past week that relies in
part on printing more money and imposing some Soviet-style controls
over the economy.
	   Nevertheless, Primakov has insisted that he remains dedicated to
market-oriented economic reform.
	   Details emerged Saturday about the government's plan to bail out
the country's failing commercial banks, which were caught short by
the ruble devaluation and are on the brink of bankruptcy.
	   According to accounts in the Moscow Times, Izvestia and other
newspapers, the Central Bank is moving to buy back treasury bonds _
now virtually worthless _ from the private banks, using freshly
printed rubles.
	   Although it is not clear how much the Central Bank is offering
for the bonds, known as GKOs, it is clearly far more than their
value, and is intended to prime the banks' pumps so they can begin
paying debts and getting money back into the economy.
	   The Moscow Times said the process began Friday evening and was
to be completed Saturday. However, one Central Bank official,
commenting on condition of anonymity, said the process would take
several days.
	   The Central Bank's spokeswoman was not answering her telephone
Saturday, and there was no official word on the bailout operation.
	   The debt swap is expected to involve the printing of billions of
new rubles, which almost certainly will contribute to inflation.
Consumer prices have already begun to soar after being kept under
control for more than a year.
	   The Russian Communist Party, the dominant voice in parliament,
has so far acquiesced in the economic program, which is being
shaped in part by one of its members, new Deputy Prime Minister
Yuri Maslyukov.
	   However, the party remains strongly opposed to Yeltsin's
presidency, and met Saturday intending to fine-tune plans for a
national day of protest scheduled for Oct. 7.
	   Entering the plenum, which once set the course of the Soviet
Union, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov repeated his oft-spoken
call for Yeltsin's resignation.
	   ``The country is being ruled by lawlessness, anarchy and a
home-bound president,'' Zyuganov told the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin has spent most of his time recently at the presidential
``Rus'' residence. His summit with Kuchma was originally to have
been in Ukraine, but was switched at the last minute to Yeltsin's
residence.
	   Aides have continued to insist that Yeltsin is healthy, however.

Pakistani shooter reported called for second doping test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A Pakistani shooter was summoned
to the Commonwealth Games doping control center Saturday for a
second test, Bernama news agency said.
	   Quoted a source it did not name, the Malaysian news agency said
the shooter was asked to come to Kuala Lumpur immediately from
Langkawi Island, site of the games' shooting competition.
	   It said the outcome of the first test and the reason for the
second were not immediately known.
	   Dr. M. Jegathesan, chairman of the doping control center
subcommittee, declined to comment, citing prescribed procedures for
handling doping cases.
	   An official at the Pakistan team office said no one was
available to comment on the report.

Presidents of Zambia, Tanzania discuss Congo crisis with Museveni
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ENTEBBE, Uganda (AP) _ The presidents of Zambia and Tanzania met
Saturday with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to discuss ways to
end the six-week conflict in Congo.
	   Frederick Chiluba and Benjamin Mkapa were expected to make a
statement at the end of their day-long meetings with the Ugandan
leader, who earlier in the week vowed to keep Ugandan troops in
Congo as long as his country's security was threatened.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila accuses both Uganda and Rwanda of
backing rebels who are trying to topple him.
	   Uganda says its troops are in northeastern Congo under an
agreement with Kabila earlier in the year to permit Uganda to flush
out rebels who have been attacking western Uganda.
	   But Museveni denies Ugandan forces are aiding the Congolese
rebels.
	   Rwanda also denies its troops are participating directly in the
conflict, but it has also reserved the right to intervene to
protect its national interests.
	   Rwandan Hutu rebels, remnants of the army and militia that
carried out the 1994 genocide against minority Tutsis in Rwanda,
have been launching attacks against Rwanda from northeastern Congo.
	   Initial reports indicated Chiluba and Mkapa were to stop in the
Rwandan capital, Kigali, as well Saturday to discuss the congo
situation with Rwandan leaders. But late on Friday, a Rwandan
spokesman said the stopever had apparently been scrapped, although
Rwanda was ready to meet with the two presidents.
	   Late Friday, the Congolese rebels said they had captured Isiro,
the largest town in northeastern Congo, 380 kilometers (235 miles)
northeast of Kisangani.
	   Ugandan troops were reported to be in the Isiro area earlier in
the month.

Storm floods more Philippine towns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 6th new graf with calamity declared. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FERNANDO, Philippines (AP) _ More towns were flooded as a
tropical storm drenched much of the northern Philippines Saturday,
killing at least 11 people and forcing thousands of people to flee
rising floodwaters.
	   The storm also whipped up large waves that sank a ferryboat
carrying more than 400 people south of Manila before dawn Saturday.
	   By midafternoon, the navy reported 267 people had been rescued
and two were confirmed dead. Others were still missing.
	   In the Manila suburb of Marikina, police reported four members
of a family were killed when their house was buried in tons of mud
loosened by the rain.
	   Five people drowned in floodwaters in Pangasinan province
northwest of the Philippine capital, police said.
	   President Joseph Estrada declared a state of calamity in the
provinces of Pampanga and Pangasinan, opening the way for
government assistance.
	   In the Central Luzon region north of Manila, more than 223,600
people in six provinces were affected by the floodwaters, according
to Florita Villar, regional director of the Department of Social
Welfare and Development.
	   Another 33,666 people in eight towns were affected in
Pangasinan, the Office of Civil Defense reported.
	   More than 2,627 people in metropolitan Manila were evacuated to
temporary shelters in government schools.
	   Adelaido Manabat, executive director of the Provincial Disaster
Coordinating Council of Pampanga, the hardest hit province, said
floodwaters destroyed a 150-meter (500-foot) section of an earthen
dike in Lubao town.
	   Police were forced to close a flooded road to the Subic Bay
Freeport late Friday and opened it only to large trucks early
Saturday.
	   Weathermen reported that Tropical Storm Vicki, which was
stationary above the South China Sea northwest of Manila overnight,
had moved east toward the mountain city of Baguio at 10 a.m. (0200
GMT) Saturday and weakened into a tropical depression.

	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Residents of small islands in
the eastern Caribbean stocked up on food and water as Hurricane
Georges approached Saturday.
	   Hurricane watches were posted from St. Lucia to Anguilla. People
were calm, but they also were taking the strengthening storm
seriously.
	   ``I just pulled up two of my boats out of the water,'' said
David Armour, a resident on Dominica, the mountainous island that
lies directly in Georges' path. ``The gas stations are full. People
are filling their tanks.''
	   At (0900 GMT) Saturday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami
said Georges, with winds of 105 mph (170 kph) winds, was located
about 650 miles (1,050 kilometers) east of the Lesser Antilles. It
was expected to reach the Lesser Antilles sometime this weekend.
	   Hurricane watches were posted Friday in St. Lucia, Dominica,
Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saba, Antigua, St. Maarten, Anguilla and
other islands as disaster preparedness teams met to plan for
Georges, the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic season.
	   ``It looks like it's coming straight for us in Dominica,''
Armour, assistant director of the Anchorage Hotel, said Friday.
``We're going to start preparing the hotel tomorrow by boarding up
the windows and collecting food and water.''
	   A few miles (kilometers) south in Martinique, residents stocked
up on water, candles and batteries Friday. The sound of hammers on
nails also rang out across St. Maarten, where residents remember
the devastation from Hurricane Luis three years ago.
	   Georges could affect a large area: hurricane force winds
extended 35 miles (55 kilometers) from the center, and tropical
storm force winds extended outward up to 200 miles (320
kilometers).

Taiwan, China to hold preliminary meeting next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan and China agreed Saturday to hold a
preliminary meeting in Beijing next week to discuss the first visit
to the mainland by Taiwan's top negotiator.
	   After months of negotiations, China agreed early this week to
the Oct. 14-19 visit to Beijing and Shanghai by Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, a semi-official
body which handles exchanges with China in the absence of formal
ties.
	   The Foundation said in a statement that its Vice Chairman Shi
Hwei-yow will meet his Chinese counterpart Tang Shubei in Beijing
Sept. 22-24 to arrange a meeting between Koo and his Chinese
counterpart Wang Daohan.
	   While Taiwan hopes the visit could pave the way for restarting
long-stalled dialogue, the agenda proposed by China limited the
visit to sightseeing, entertainment and social functions. Koo and
Wang were to meet at a dinner and attend a Peking opera together.
	   China suspended the regular dialogue three years ago in anger
over a Taiwanese campaign to gain international recognition.
Beijing wants to go straight into political issues when the
dialogue is resumed.
	   But Taipei wants to pick up where it left off by starting with
practical issues such as trade in order to nurture an atmosphere
for future talks on sensitive political issues.
	   Returning from a visit to Beijing, a Taiwanese scholar Feng
Hu-hsiang, a vice chairman of a pro-unification group, attacked the
Taiwan government Friday for its tough stance on China, saying it
left Beijing with no alternatives but to limit Koo's visit to
sightseeing.
	   In response, Chang King-yuh, chairman of the government Mainland
Affairs Council, said Taiwan was seeking a peaceful relationship
with China that ensures mutual respect and benefit, and he hopes
the Koo-Wang meeting could steer relationship back on track.
	   Taiwan is seat of the Nationalist government which fled the
Communists takeover of the mainland in 1949.

German railway finds cracked seam on locomotive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German railway took four
high-speed InterCity Express locomotives out of service after
finding one with a cracked weld on the undercarriage, officials
reported Saturday.
	   The seam apparently cracked Thursday on a stretch between
Hanover and Hamm in northern Germany and was located during a
routine check the same day, railway spokesman Stephan Heimbach
said.
	   ``All maintenance, inspection and security systems worked,'' he
said, adding he could not say if the passengers on the train were
ever in any danger.
	   The railway immediately checked all 44 locomotives of the same
second-generation ICE type and found three with ``suspicious
moments,'' he said. They were also taken out of service.
	   All first-generation ICEs were also being checked, but no
problems have been found there, he said.
	   A first-generation ICE crashed near Eschede in northern Germany
on June 3, killing 100 passengers. Officials suspect wheel failure
as the likely cause.

Representatives of Lockerbie families fly to Tripoli for talks

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Representatives of British families who lost
relatives in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Scotland flew
to Tripoli Saturday to talk to government officials about plans to
try two Libyan suspects.
	   The north African nation has accepted a proposal from the United
States and Britain to try the two men in the Netherlands by
Scottish judges under Scottish law, but is arguing specifics about
the treatment of the two suspects.
	   Britain and the United States have both rejected Libyan demands
for guarantees before the suspects are turned over.
	   Dr. Jim Swire, spokesman for U.K. Families Flight 103 and Robert
Black, a professor of law at Edinburgh University in Scotland, were
expected in the Libyan capital later Saturday.
	   ''The trip is being made following an invitation, passed through
the Libyan interests section of the Saudi Arabian Embassy in
London,'' said a spokesman for Swire, whose daughter Flora was
among the 270 dead.
	   ''The trip is being made as part of (Swire and Black's) ongoing
commitment to the search for truth and justice,'' he said, but
refused to elaborate. Swire has campaigned vigorously to bring the
two Libyans to court and it was Black who in 1994 initiated the
idea of a non-jury trial in a third country.
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 to try to
force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to surrender the two suspects.
	   Under the U.S.-British plan, the suspects could not be
extradited once they arrive in the Netherlands. But if convicted,
they would have to serve their sentences in a British prison.
	   Gadhafi wants details of the proceedings and the suspects'
treatment once they are in Dutch custody, and assurances that the
suspects will have the right of appeal.

Chinese police detain more dissidents

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with detention of another dissident; adds byline
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police have detained several more dissidents,
human rights groups said Saturday, as authorities tightened their
repression of political dissent.
	   Among the latest to be detained was a Beijing labor organizer, a
dissident based in northeastern Jilin and another dissident who was
trying to register an opposition party in eastern Shandong,
according to reports from the rights groups and dissidents.
	   Zhu Rui, a onetime political activist who sought to organize
protests by laid-off workers at her factory, was taken away by
police in the predawn hours Saturday morning, New York-based Human
Rights in China reported.
	   The group said Zhu also had been detained for 12 days during the
visit to China of U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson, who left
Beijing on Tuesday after a 10-day visit.
	   Zhu, who took part in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement in
Beijing, tried earlier this year to organize fellow laid-off
workers at Beijing's 3501 Uniform Factory to stage a peaceful
protest over the terms of their severance pay.
	   On Sept. 4, police dragged Zhu, who had hoped to try to meet
Robinson, away from her home as she was waiting for her son to
return from school. She was released Wednesday, only to be detained
again Saturday.
	   Liu Lianjun, one of many dissidents who have been trying to
register the China Democracy Party, an opposition group, with the
government was detained Saturday in eastern Shandong province, a
fellow dissident said.
	   In another detention, police on Friday took Tang Yuanjuan, a
dissident from northeastern Changchun who was visiting Beijing for
medical treatment, away from the home of prominent dissident Xu
Wenli, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said.
	   The Hong Kong-based group said Tang had been in Xu's home for
only a short time when a group of police officers forced him to
leave. Since then, there has been no word on Tang's whereabouts, it
added.
	   Six fellow dissidents from Changchun issued an open letter
protesting Tang's detention, it said.
	   Tang was one of several workers at Changchun's massive First
Auto Works who were jailed for organizing sympathy protests with
the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in Beijing in 1989. A court
later commuted his sentence of 20 years to eight, and he was
released last year.
	   Tang and two of his fellow dissidents were interrogated and
threatened by police after they sent a letter to U.S. President
Bill Clinton urging him to press Chinese leaders on human rights
during his visit to China in June.
	   The visits by Clinton and Robinson prompted China's persecuted
dissident community to intensify their efforts to press for greater
freedoms.
	   Liu Lianjun and other dissidents in Shandong province were
encouraged when on Sept. 11 local Civil Affairs Ministry officials
did not reject outright their application to register the China
Democracy Party, as required by law.
	   The seemingly mild official reaction to the application led some
dissidents to speculate that the ruling Communists might allow an
opposition group for the first time in 49 years.
	   But Chinese authorities have since indicated that there is no
softening of the government's ban on opposition groups, or public
dissent.

Singapore says Malaysian move to restrict airspace has little
</HEADLINE>
impact

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore said Saturday that Malaysia's recent
move to restrict military planes from its airspace will have little
impact.
	   ``There will be some adjustments required but no impact on
operations and training,'' said a statement from the Ministry of
Defense.
	   Malaysia banned Singaporean military and rescue-search planes
from its air space beginning Friday, reversing the previous blanket
approval for all such flights. Now, the flights require
case-by-case permission.
	   Singapore's statement said that the air force has been going
ahead with ``its usual training and operational flights.''
	   Singapore military aircraft do not need to fly through Malaysian
airspace to proceed to their training grounds and the planes can
land and take off from its air bases by flying over water, it said.
	   The Malaysian decision was seen as an escalation of the
diplomatic wrangle that has gripped the neighboring Southeast Asian
nations for weeks.
	   The two countries have bickered recently over everything from
the relocation of a railroad border post to water supplies, for
which Singapore relies heavily on its northern neighbor.
	   Although no reason was given for the decision, Malaysian Defense
Minister Syed Hamid denied it was retaliation for the memoirs
published this week by Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew.
	   Malaysian politicians say the book, which accused the Malaysian
leadership of corruption, has hurt relations between the two
countries that were merged from 1963-65.
	   In past years, Malaysian residents and local government just
across the narrow Johor Straits separating the two countries have
complained about the loud noise from Singapore fighter jets.
	   But Singapore's Ministry of Defense said the new flight routes,
prompted by the ban, may cause more noise in that area.

South Africa wins inaugural Commonwealth Games cricket
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Waugh, Rindel quotes; CORRECTS to four wickets in
first graf
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Opener Mike Rindel tamed
Australian pacemen and spinners alike Saturday for a flawless 67 as
South Africa defeated favorite Australia by four wickets for the
gold medal in the inaugural Commonwealth Games cricket tournament.
	   The historic victory overshadowed Australian captain Steve
Waugh's unbeaten 90, which rescued his team from 58 for 4 to 183
all out. Australia's top order was destroyed by South African
captain Shaun Pollock, who took three wickets in his opening spell
and finished with 4-19 off nine overs.
	   But the target of 184 was apparently too small on a dry batter's
wicket that Pollock had judged correctly as he won the toss and
chose to bat second.
	   ``We just picked the bad day to have an off day,'' Waugh said,
adding that the Australians batted badly and were about 50 runs
short of a possible winning target.
	   Putting on the best South African performance in the tournament,
Rindel and Andrew Hudson came out blazing as they scored at a run
rate of more than 6 while the required rate was 3.68. Their batting
shredded Australia's reputation, built around the full-strength
limited overs side it fielded, unlike other test playing countries
in the 16-nation tournament.
	   Rindel said he and Hudson told themselves to ``just keep
going.''
	   ``We were focusing on every 10 runs and putting it behind us,''
said Rindel, 35, who plays for the English club Leek in
Staffordshire.
	   By the 10th over, Rindel and Hudson had posted 73 runs. At that
point, trying to flick spinner Gavin Robertson, Hudson gave an easy
catch to Michael Bevan at fine leg for 36. He had survived a
difficult catch in the first slip by Mark Waugh in the first over.
	   But the aggression continued as Rindel dispatched the other
spinner, Brad Young, to two consecutive fours in the 13th over.
	   Rindel and new man Jacques Kallis continued to tire out the
Australians under the torrid tropical heat as the fielding
continued to slip. Rindel took two hesitant defensive shots to
judge Brad Young when he opened the spin attack in the 8th over.
The third ball he lifted above the bowler's head for a four to
bring up South Africa's 50.
	   He and Kallis shared a 72-run partnership until Rindel was out
to a superb reflex action catch by Mark Waugh off Darren Lehmann at
forward short leg, ending a 2-hour, 15-minute innings of 106 balls
with seven fours.
	   Kallis was caught behind off Lehmann again for 44 with the score
at 181. Next man in was Pollock, who leveled the scores but was out
caught by Young trying to hit the winning shot off Lehmann. The
winning run was scored by Dale Benkenstein and South Africa
finished at 184 for 6.
	   Earlier, Pollock shocked Australia, dismissing opener Mark
Waugh, one drop Ricky Ponting and opener Adam Gilchrist in the 3rd,
5th and 9th overs.
	   Waugh stepped in at that stage and began to put together the
innings as seven Australians came to the crease and returned to the
pavilion. He ran out of partners in the last over with three balls
to go.
	   Waugh has scored 215 runs in five innings without losing his
wickets over the past 10 days.
	   ``I would swap it for a gold medal,'' he said. ``All the guys
would.''
	   He said Australia suffered from a ``lot of soft dismissals, lot
of poor shots today; not up to standards that we are used to.''
	   Waugh opened his account with a square cut that was perfectly
perpendicular to the pitch and he went on to hit five more fours
and two sixes in his 109-ball knock.

	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Prince Philip ducked out of
the royal party Saturday to visit a command post for firefighters
who recently battled the worst smog in Bruneian history.
	   To the brass-band strains of ``Hawaii Five-0'' and ``Born
Free,'' dozens of firefighters put out a blaze deliberately set
before the husband of Queen Elizabeth II.
	   The prince, a former British naval officer and avid
environmentalist, congratulated the firefighters and asked many
questions about their equipment and techniques.
	   The royal couple were making their first state visit to the
former British colony since 1972. They depart Sunday for
neighboring Malaysia, which last year also suffered for months
under a thick cloud of smoke blown in from forest fires in nearby
Indonesia.
	   From January until April, the haze in this tiny kingdom on the
northern tip of Borneo was so bad that only the dome on the
sultan's enormous palace could be seen.
	   Raging brush fires, provoked by the worst drought in the region
for decades, caused a haze so thick the airport was shut down for
several days in April. Schools were closed and foreign embassies
evacuated much of their staff.
	   Residents wore surgical masks and thousands of people sought
treatment as hospitals for respiratory illnesses.
	   ``This was the worst ever,'' said Sallehuddin bin Haji Ibrahim,
the commander of the field post. ``The weather was so dry and the
fires out of control.''
	   Some 7,000 hectares of rain forest were destroyed during the
latest haze alert.
	   Earlier in the day, the prince and British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook met with local businessmen.

Russia bailing out banks, forms `anti-crisis' group with Ukraine

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government moved ahead on dual fronts Saturday
to rescue the failing economy, carrying out a complicated bank
bailout and signing an ``anti-crisis'' agreement with neighboring
Ukraine.
	   The Communist Party, meanwhile, held its annual party plenum _
once the central event in the nation's political life _ and its
leader once again called on President Boris Yeltsin to resign.
	   Yeltsin was busy hosting his Ukrainian counterpart, Leonid
Kuchma, whose own country is taking a pounding from the economic
storm lashing Russia. The two leaders agreed to create an
``anti-crisis group'' that will look into ways they can shore up
their economies together.
	   In particular, the two presidents said they would take urgent
measures to to stop a decline in trade between the two countries,
Yeltsin's press service said.
	   Kuchma said afterward that he and Yeltsin ``affirmed the path of
strategic partnership,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The Russian economy is at a near standstill after the events of
the past month, during which the ruble has been devalued, the
country has defaulted on its foreign loans and has changed
governments.
	   The new government, under Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, began
to formulate an economic program in the past week that relies in
part on printing more money and imposing some Soviet-style controls
over the economy.
	   Nevertheless, Primakov has insisted that he remains dedicated to
market-oriented economic reform.
	   Details emerged Saturday about the government's plan to bail out
the country's failing commercial banks, which were caught short by
the ruble devaluation and are on the brink of bankruptcy.
	   According to accounts in the Moscow Times, Izvestia and other
newspapers, the Central Bank is moving to buy back treasury bonds _
now virtually worthless _ from the private banks, using freshly
printed rubles.
	   Although it is not clear how much the Central Bank is offering
for the bonds, known as GKOs, it is clearly far more than their
value, and is intended to prime the banks' pumps so they can begin
paying debts and getting money back into the economy.
	   The Moscow Times said the process began Friday evening and was
to be completed Saturday. However, one Central Bank official,
commenting on condition of anonymity, said the process would take
several days.
	   The Central Bank's spokeswoman was not answering her telephone
Saturday, and there was no official word on the bailout operation.
	   The debt swap is expected to involve the printing of billions of
new rubles, which almost certainly will contribute to inflation.
Consumer prices have already begun to soar after being kept under
control for more than a year.
	   The Russian Communist Party, the dominant voice in parliament,
has so far acquiesced in the economic program, which is being
shaped in part by one of its members, new Deputy Prime Minister
Yuri Maslyukov.
	   However, the party remains strongly opposed to Yeltsin's
presidency, and met Saturday intending to fine-tune plans for a
national day of protest scheduled for Oct. 7.
	   Entering the plenum, which once set the course of the Soviet
Union, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov repeated his oft-spoken
call for Yeltsin's resignation.
	   ``The country is being ruled by lawlessness, anarchy and a
home-bound president,'' Zyuganov told the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin has spent most of his time recently at the presidential
``Rus'' residence. His summit with Kuchma was originally to have
been in Ukraine, but was switched at the last minute to Yeltsin's
residence.
	   Aides have continued to insist that Yeltsin is healthy, however.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Trying to prevent new unrest, an
international delegation met Albania's former president on Saturday
to discuss ways to end the crisis sparked by rioting this week that
threatened to topple the government.
	   Ex-President Sali Berisha's followers have demanded the
resignation of Prime Minister Fatos Nano since last weekend's

	   As Berisha met members of the Organization for Security and

Press councils mull international code of ethics, watchdog group

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Leaders of more than a dozen
press-monitoring councils around the world opened a conference
Saturday in Istanbul with organizers urging establishment of an
international code of ethics for journalists and an institution to
deal with its violations.
	   The World Association of Press Councils, comparatively
little-known until now, has attracted the attention of other
journalism groups with the watchdog proposals on the agenda for its
three-day meeting.
	   ``In our opinion, a free and responsible press can only be
sustained through a well-managed, self-controlled mechanism,'' said
Oktay Eksi, host of the meeting and president of the Turkish Press
Council.
	   A number of groups _ including the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, which is not attending the conference _ oppose
establishing an international organization to monitor journalism,
contending it could easily become an institution of press
restriction rather than press freedom.
	   ``The journalists of the world will not and should not be
accountable to any self-appointed group,'' ASNE President Edward
Seaton wrote in a letter to Eksi.
	   ``We have got to try to stop this before it gets off the
ground,'' said Ronald Koven of the Reston, Virginia-based World
Press Freedom Committee, who was attending the conference.
	   The Turkish Press Council is the staunchest defender of the
proposal.
	   Many here believe that Turkey is unfairly treated by the
international press, particularly in the coverage of the Kurdish
rebellion in southeastern Turkey and the division of Cyprus.
	   ``When something contrary to the truth concerning your country,
your people or yourselves is published beyond your national
boundaries, you cannot find an address to which to forward your
complaints,'' Eksi said.
	   ``We at the Turkish Press Council believe that the establishing
of a voluntary mechanism with the aim of helping individuals,
companies and governments to enforce their rights ... is now an
inescapable necessity,'' Eksi said.
	   The international institution would receive complaints and
comment on them. No sanctions would follow, the proposal's backers
say.
	   Delegates are scheduled to discuss the establishment of an
ethics code later Saturday and of monitoring body on Sunday.
	   Established in New Delhi in 1992, the association has 16 press
councils in various countries to deal with local complaints about
the news media.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Representatives of British families who lost
relatives in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Scotland flew
to Tripoli Saturday to talk to government officials about plans to
try two Libyan suspects.
	   The north African nation has accepted a proposal from the United
States and Britain to try the two men in the Netherlands by
Scottish judges under Scottish law, but is arguing specifics about
the treatment of the two suspects.
	   Britain and the United States have both rejected Libyan demands
for guarantees before the suspects are turned over.
	   Dr. Jim Swire, spokesman for U.K. Families Flight 103 and Robert
Black, a professor of law at Edinburgh University in Scotland, were
expected in the Libyan capital later Saturday.
	   ''We were asked urgently to come to Tripoli by the Libyan
mission in London and we will speak to the (suspects') legal
team,'' Swire said Saturday morning from Brussels, Belgium, where
he and Black were awaiting a flight to Tunisia.
	   ''The two sides are getting closer and I am very optimistic that
the matter will be resolved,'' said Swire, whose daughter Flora was
among the 270 dead.
	   ''What gives us a chance is that the Libyans trust us as people
who are just looking for justice and not for any political
advantage.''
	   Swire has campaigned vigorously to bring the two Libyans to
court and it was Black who in 1994 initiated the idea of a non-jury
trial in a third country.
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 to try to
force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to surrender the two suspects.
	   Under the U.S.-British plan, the suspects could not be
extradited once they arrive in the Netherlands. But if convicted,
they would have to serve their sentences in a British prison.
	   Gadhafi wants details of the proceedings and the suspects'
treatment once they are in Dutch custody, and assurances that the
suspects will have the right of appeal.

Police outnumber neo-Nazis at campaign rally in east Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROSTOCK, Germany (AP) _ Eighty people were arrested and one
police officer injured Saturday in the Baltic port city of Rostock,
where an extreme-right party held its final campaign rally a week
before national and state elections.
	   Police said about 2,000 supporters of the extremist National
Party of Germany had turned out for the rally, less than half the
5,000 party officials had predicted.
	   Between 1,000 and 2,000 leftists staged a counter-demonstration
at the same time, and 5,000 police officers from across Germany
were out in force to keep the two sides separate and prevent
violence.
	   By midday, police said 80 people had been taken into temporary
custody for scuffling with police or throwing stones and other
objects. One police officer was injured by a projectile.
	   The police deployment was the biggest ever in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, an economically depressed state in
former communist east Germany.
	   Officers stopped cars at roadblocks for checks and helicopters
flew overhead during the rally. Both sides complained that their
supporters couldn't reach the rallies because of the controls.
	   The city of Rostock initially banned the National Party rally,
the anti-foreigner party's last major campaign event in the state
before Sept. 27 elections both for the federal and state
parliaments.
	   But the courts overturned the ban after the party agreed to move
the site away from the part of Rostock that was the scene of an
anti-foreigner arson attack and skinhead rioting in 1992.

Iranian president heads for New York
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian President Mohammad Khatami left
Saturday for New York, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
	   Khatami is due to address the U.N. General Assembly on Monday
and is expected to use the speech to promote his government's new
image of seeking international cooperation after two decades of
hostility with the United States and the West.
	   He will be the first Iranian president to speak to the General
Assembly since President Ali Khamenei in 1986. Khamenei, who is now
Iran's supreme leader, used the occasion to blast ``The Great
Satan,'' as Iranian hard-liners call the United States.
	   Since taking office in August 1997, Khatami, a moderate cleric,
has eased his country's 20-year confrontation with the United
States, encouraged freedom of speech and relaxed the strict Islamic
social code.
	   Khatami has no plans to meet with Clinton or other U.S.
officials. The countries have had no diplomatic relations since
1979 when Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and
held its occupants hostage.
	   On Sunday, Khatami will meet wealthy Iranian-American
businessmen in New York in a bid to attract foreign investment to
Iran.

Serb forces advance on scattered guerrillas in Kosovo's north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KICIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and Yugoslav forces swept Kosovo
Albanian guerrillas from one of their last remaining strongholds on
Saturday. The rebels issued a public plea for recruits.
	   The rat-tat-tat of machine-gun fire echoed in the region
northwest of Pristina, capital of Kosovo province. Behind the lines
of the Serb-Yugoslav advance, muddy roads were criss-crossed by
tank tread-marks. Sand-bag barricades left by hastily fleeing
guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army were littered by tins of
food, empty ammunition boxes, clothing and mattresses.
	   A guerrilla statement, published Saturday in Pristina's
Albanian-language media, claimed their forces are ``successfully
resisting the latest enemy offensive.'' But it asked for
reinforcements, urging Kosovo Albanian men with military skills to
``join the fight for freedom.''
	   The mountainous area north and northwest of Pristina, Kosovo's
capital, is one of two remaining guerrilla strongholds. The other,
in the central-western region of Drenica, has also been the scene
of fighting in the last week.
	   The KLA statement Saturday accused Serbs of aiming to rid the
areas of civilians as well as guerrillas.
	   ``The enemy is not just aiming to expel the KLA, but to
ethnically cleanse Kosovo,'' said the statement.
	   The United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees said at least
10,000 civilians fled Kosovo's northern mountains since the
offensive.
	   At least 600 people have died and upward of 275,000 have fled
their homes since February, when Serbian police launched a
crackdown on the KLA, which seeks to wrest Kosovo province from
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   On Friday, Ibrahim Rugova, Kosovo's top Albanian leader, gave
his public backing to a U.S.-sponsored plan denying his people the
independence they seek but offering them peace and local autonomy.
	   The ethnic Albanian guerrillas have rejected any negotiated
settlement short of independence from Serbia. But they have been
marginalized after months of defeats.
	   The U.S.-backed Rugova also favors independence but opposes
fighting for it. U.S. officials have been saying for weeks that
Rugova had in principle accepted the American plan, along with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   But his public endorsement of the interim formula appeared
calculated to coincide with the latest crushing defeats of his
militant rivals.
	   Rugova called the draft a ``temporary solution,'' aimed at
``normalizing the difficult and risky situation ... halting attacks
and the use of force.''
	   The plan would give Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo,
the say over local affairs but keep them part of Serbia and within
Yugoslavia. Kosovo's autonomy was revoked in 1989 by Milosevic.
	   Fires still smoldered Saturday in haystacks and houses of the
deserted area. Two schoolhouses in the wake of the Serb advance
were gutted by fire, their roofs collapsed.
	   Residents of Kicic, on the southern perimeter of the area of
fighting, said hundreds of civilians fleeing to nearby towns
recounted stories of at least 20 civilians dead.
	   Nearby fighting prevented reporters from visiting an area where,
Kicic residents said, several dead civilians lie.
	   Elsewhere in the province, Serb sources reported that one
policeman died overnight at the Belgrade military hospital after
being shot near Pec, Kosovo's second largest city, Friday
afternoon.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Security forces searched Saturday for
the perpetrators of a bomb attack near the city of Tiaret, which
killed at least 29 people and injured at least 110 others.
	   The attackers had placed the bomb in a bag of potatoes left at
the Zaroura market in Tiaret, a city 310 kilometers (about 200
miles) south of Algiers.
	   The attack was announced Friday evening in a brief statement
from Algerian security forces. The statement said seven of the
injured were in serious condition.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bomb
which went off about 5 p.m. (1800 GMT) Friday when the market was
crowded with shoppers.
	   Residents of Tiaret, reached by telephone, said the security
forces were searching the area, about 310 kilometers (190 miles)
southeast of the capital Algiers. The hospital sources and the
residents spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The victims were taken to hospitals in Oran and Relizane.
	   The explosion was the latest in an upsurge in violence in
Algeria that has occurred following the decision by President
Liamine Zeroual last week to step down and call early elections.
	   Zeroual, a former general, has been unable to put a stop to
violence that erupted in 1992 after an Islamic insurgency broke out
after the military canceled parliamentary elections an Islamic
party was set to win.
	   At least 75,000 people have been killed in violence since then.
	   This week, a U.N. fact-finding team released the results of an
inquiry conducted this summer. The group condemned what it called
extremism that has spurred the violence, but it also called on the
government to exercise greater control on the security forces,
which have been accused of carrying out some of the attacks.
	   The report was immediately criticized by the human rights group
Amnesty International, which called it a whitewash and said the
U.N. team had failed to address key human rights abuses.

Presidents of Zambia, Tanzania discuss Congo crisis with Museveni

 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ENTEBBE, Uganda (AP) _ The presidents of Zambia and Tanzania met
Saturday with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to discuss ways to
end the six-week conflict in Congo.
	   Frederick Chiluba and Benjamin Mkapa were expected to make a
statement at the end of their day-long meetings with the Ugandan
leader, who earlier in the week vowed to keep Ugandan troops in
Congo as long as his country's security was threatened.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila accuses both Uganda and Rwanda of
backing rebels who are trying to topple him.
	   Uganda says its troops are in northeastern Congo under an
agreement with Kabila earlier in the year to permit Uganda to flush
out rebels who have been attacking western Uganda.
	   But Museveni denies Ugandan forces are aiding the Congolese
rebels.
	   Rwanda also denies its troops are participating directly in the
conflict, but it has also reserved the right to intervene to
protect its national interests.
	   Rwandan Hutu rebels, remnants of the army and militia that
carried out the 1994 genocide against minority Tutsis in Rwanda,
have been launching attacks against Rwanda from northeastern Congo.
	   Initial reports indicated Chiluba and Mkapa were to stop in the
Rwandan capital, Kigali, as well Saturday to discuss the Congo
situation with Rwandan leaders. But late on Friday, a Rwandan
spokesman said the stopever had apparently been scrapped, although
Rwanda was ready to meet with the two presidents.
	   A senior Rwandan official said Saturday that time was running
out for a negotiated solution and predicted Chiluba's peace efforts
would be ``futile'' unless the Zambian president met with the Congo
rebels.
	   ``I think we are at a critical point,'' Education Minister
Joseph Karemera told reporters in Johannesburg. ``It is not enough
to just keep talking.''
	   Karemera said Rwandan intelligence operatives discovered six
months ago that Kabila was organizing the training of 10,000 Hutu
militiamen in the southern Congo town of Kamina. He accused Kabila
of fomenting genocide against ethnic Tutsis in Congo.
	   ``If Kabila continues the genocide we will have to defend those
people ... directly or indirectly,'' Karemera said.
	   Late Friday, the Congolese rebels said they had captured Isiro,
the largest town in northeastern Congo, 380 kilometers (235 miles)
northeast of Kisangani.
	   Ugandan troops were reported to be in the Isiro area earlier in
the month.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A new no-frills airline took off Saturday, becoming
the first Japanese carrier in 35 years to break into the market
here, long dominated by three airlines.
	   Skymark Airlines offers half-price airfare on the world's
second-busiest route connecting Tokyo and Japan's southern hub of
Fukuoka.
	   Domestic airfares in Japan are among the highest in the world.
It is cheaper to fly to other Asian cities, or even to America, and
return than it is to take a round-trip flight within Japan.
	   The airline hopes to attract customers who have tightened their
purse strings at the time of recession.
	   ``Big Bang in this industry is starting as of 19th September,''
Skymark President Junichi Ogawara said, referring to Tokyo's recent
``Big Bang'' policy of easing government regulations to open
markets and encourage new businesses.
	   ``The operation of Skymark is certainly the beginning of the Big
Bang,'' he said at Tokyo's Haneda Airport before the Boeing 767
soared into the sky, carrying 308 passengers.
	   Japanese domestic air service market has long been dominated by
Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways and Japan Air System.
	   Skymark plans to cut costs by simplifying the check-in and
eliminating in-flight meals, newspapers and other services. It also
uses the aircraft as a flying billboard. The plane that took off
Saturday was painted with a DirecTV ad.
	   Skymark plans to introduce its second aircraft later this year
for its planned new route connecting Osaka and Fukuoka.
	   Some fine-tuning appeared in order. The inaugural flight was
delayed 40 minutes, the second flight by more than an hour.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Air crashes have claimed 36 Russian military
aircraft and 276 lives in the past six years, a news agency
reported Saturday.
	   Interfax said the Russian air force has a record of one crash
for every 25,000-30,000 flight hours, which it said was roughly
triple the rate recorded by the U.S. military.
	   It said Russian military officials blame the crashes primarily
on pilot error caused by inadequate training. In addition, the
report noted, many Russian military aircraft are aging and not in
peak condition.

Liddel big man for NZ; Sandor wins for Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ New Zealand's Darren Liddel and
Canadian Akos Sandor won three gold medals apiece in the two
heaviest divisions on the Commonwealth Games weightlifting program
Saturday.
	   Sandor swept the men's 105-kilogram division. His 167.5-kilogram
snatch eclipsed the old Commonwealth record by 7.5 kg, and his
total of 360 beat the previous record by 2.5. England's Tommy Yule
claimed triple silver while teammate Karl Grant snared a bronze in
the clean and jerk and New Zealander Nigel Avery took bronze in the
snatch and total.
	   Liddel's sweep in the super-heavyweight division (over 105 kg)
also broke Commonwealth records.
	   He never looked like faltering as he lifted 165 in the snatch
and 202.5 in the clean and jerk. With the total of 367.5, Liddel
doubled New Zealand's overall gold tally at these games.
	   He became his country's first weightlifting medalist since 1986,
when Clayton Chelley was a silver medallist.
	   Of the 24 golds in weightlifting at these games, Australia won
six, Canada five, and England, India, New Zealand and Nauru three
each. Malaysia won one.

New clashes as American envoy wraps up visit

Palestinian Cabinet statement, changes byline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Clashes broke out Saturday outside the West
Bank town of Ramallah, a day after fighting between supporters of
the militant Islamic group Hamas and Israeli soldiers left dozens
of Palestinians hurt.
	   As a U.S. mediator prepared for a final round of talks with both
sides, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accused the Israeli
government of condoning violence by Jewish settlers against
Palestinians, and said such attacks were destroying prospects for
peace.
	   A Palestinian youth was shot dead two days earlier by a Jewish
settler near the West Bank village of Beitunia. The settler said he
acted in self-defense after his car was stoned; Palestinians said
the shooting was unprovoked. The settler is being held while
authorities investigate.
	   ``These crimes happen, and we haven't heard any denunciation of
such acts by the Israeli government,'' Arafat told his Cabinet late
Friday.
	   On the eve of the Jewish New Year, which begins at sundown
Sunday, Israel resealed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza
Strip amid warnings the Islamic militant group Hamas would try to
kidnap Israeli soldiers or detonate bombs in Israeli cities during
the two-day holiday.
	   Hamas has voted to avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers Imad
and Adel Awadallah, top Hamas fugitives who were shot to death by
Israeli troops during a raid of their West Bank hideout.
	   In a memorial rally for the Awadallahs in their West Bank
hometown of El Bireh on Friday, about 3,000 demonstrators exhorted
Hamas bombmakers: ``Blow up Tel Aviv!'' Later, some of the marchers
swarmed toward and stoned Israeli troops outside a nearby
settlement, and the soldiers responded with a hail of rubber-coated
metal bullets.
	   Palestinian officials claimed 96 youths were wounded in Friday's
fighting, but extensive checks with hospitals confirmed an injury
figure of 32.
	   Saturday's clashes were on a much smaller scale. About 20 youths
on a highway overpass outside Ramallah tore down protective fencing
meant to keep them from stoning motorists below, and hurled rocks
at a passing army jeep. ``Allahu akhbar _ God is great!'' they
screamed.
	   The soldiers fired back tear gas, dispersing them. No injuries
were reported.
	   Later, near an Israeli checkpoint south of Ramallah, youths
threw stones at soldiers and burned tires, sending plumes of black
smoke into the air. The official Voice of Palestine said Israeli
troops had encircled the area.
	   Hamas supporters also planned to rally later Saturday in the
West Bank town of Hebron, which has been a frequent flashpoint for
violence.
	   Amid the tensions, U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was wrapping
up his latest mission. He was to meet Saturday night with Arafat in
Gaza and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, then leave
early Sunday, U.S. officials said.
	   The two sides are trying to reach agreement on a long-delayed
Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank and on
revised terms of a Palestinian crackdown on militants, as proposed
by Washington.
	   After a Ross-Arafat meeting on Friday, a senior Palestinian
official told The Associated Press some progress had been made.
	   ``Mr. Ross managed to bridge the gaps on some issues,'' said
Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament. Qureia added
that the Palestinians may agree to delay their unilateral
declaration of a Palestinian state May 4 if their negotiations with
the Israelis are making progress.
	   But the Palestinian Cabinet, meeting late Friday night, offered
a more discouraging assessment, blaming Israel for the failure to
reach an accord during Ross' 11-day visit.
	   ``The mission did not achieve the progress anticipated due to
Israeli procrastination in ... acceptance of the American
Initiative,'' the Cabinet said in a statement issued Saturday.
	   At their meeting, Palestinian ministers also discussed ongoing
preparations for a statehood declaration, saying emissaries would
fan out to ``friendly countries'' to seek pledges of recognition
for any new state.
	   Netanyahu has hinted he would respond to any unilateral
statehood declaration by annexing chunks of the West Bank, a move
that would likely bring an explosion of violence.

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II, ever the
unflappable guest, strolled through a steaming hot outdoor market
along the Brunei River on Saturday.
	   Nodding at the sellers of smelly dried fish and chili peppers,
inquiring about tropical fruit and odd-looking vegetables, the
queen was completely composed beneath her yellow straw hat.
	   Everyone else, including her three ladies in waiting, were
wilting under the blazing sun.
	   ``She's a bit older, but she still has a beauty of her own, a
charisma,'' said Nor Salam, a 34-year-old accountant who rushed to
the Tamu market for a peek at the queen.
	   Nor said she met the queen during her last visit to this tiny
rain forest on the northern tip of Borneo in 1972, when Nor was
just 8 and Brunei was still a British protectorate.
	   Bruneians adore the British and hold little animosity toward
having been colonized by them for nearly a century.
	   ``It was a blessing in disguise,'' said Nor. ``When they were
here, they taught us how to run a country.''
	   Since Brunei gained full independence in 1984, the tiny
Southeast Asian sultanate of 312,000 people has become one of the
richest in the world. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, whose wealth is
estimated at some dlrs 37 billion, was educated in Britain and is
an honorary general in the British Army.
	   Dozens of British Brownies in yellow uniforms and brown sashes
waved British Union Jacks and cheered the queen as she gathered
their flowers and chatted.
	   ``She talked to us,'' squealed Corrina Bradley, 7. ``She said
the flowers were very nice and that she thought Brunei was a very
nice place.''
	   The queen took special interest in one market stall selling
collector plates, including a commemorative dish of the wedding of
Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana.
	   ``Somebody's a collector,'' she commented pleasantly,
disregarding what Buckingham Palace would consider a serious breach
of protocol. Perhaps she knew the vendor likely intended the plate
as a gesture of kindness, not a bitter reminder of her son's
divorce and Diana's death.
	   British Foreign Minister Robin Cook bought himself a jar of
honey, noting that's his personal weakness.
	   The British photographers continued their relentless pursuit of
Cook's new wife Gaynor Regan, his former aide for whom he recently
left his wife of 28 years, causing a tabloid scandal.
	   The market visit was a far cry from the elegant gala at the
sultan's grand palace Friday night, a state banquet set in the
majestic splendor befitting two of the world's oldest dynasties,
hosted by the sultan and his two wives.
	   The queen's press secretary said that while Buckingham Palace
was trying to present the queen as more accessible to ordinary
people, in the much-admired style of Princess Diana, she still had
an obligation to represent the 1,000-year-old British monarchy.
	   The queen later visited a science college, where she inaugurated
a computer link with a grammar school back in Britain.
	   Wearing her glasses, the queen sat at a computer with schoolgirl
Hjh Leny and accessed the Buckingham Palace Web site on the
Internet, showing a picture of herself in a white gown.
	   ``I love that dress,'' said 16-year-old Hjh.
	   The queen replied, ``It's one of my favorites, too.''
	   The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, wrap up their four-day
visit Sunday and fly to neighboring Malaysia, another former
British colony.
	   The queen will visit athletes competing in the 16th Commonwealth
Games and, as the head of the Commonwealth, officially close the
games Monday.

German railway finds cracked seam on locomotive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report on Eschede crash &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German railway took four
high-speed InterCity Express locomotives out of service after
finding one with a cracked weld on the undercarriage, officials
reported Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, a news magazine reported that prosecutors were
considering charges of negligent manslaughter against two railway
technicians who overlooked a wheel problem on the ICE train that
crashed June 3, killing 101 people.
	   In the recent case, railway spokesman Stephan Heimbach said the
seam apparently cracked Thursday on a stretch between Hanover and
Hamm in northern Germany and was located during a routine check the
same day.
	   ``All maintenance, inspection and security systems worked,'' he
said, adding he could not say if the passengers on the train were
ever in any danger.
	   The railway immediately checked all 44 locomotives of the same
second-generation ICE type and found three with ``suspicious
moments,'' he said. They were also taken out of service.
	   All first-generation ICEs were also being checked, but no
problems have been found there, he said.
	   The June 3 crash of a first-generation ICE crashed near Eschede
in northern Germany was the country's worst-ever rail disaster.
Officials suspect wheel failure as the likely cause.
	   Der Spiegel news magazine reported Saturday that investigators
have learned that two checks on that train just before the crash
found a wheel was out of round by more than the railway's own
standards allow, but nothing was done.
	   Two nights before the crash it was measured at 0.8 millimeters
out of round, and the night before at 1.1 millimeters. The standard
allowance is 0.6 millimeters.
	   Railway officials say a misformed wheel is mainly a comfort
problem because it creates more noise and vibration during high
speed. But the magazine quoted rail experts as saying that over
time, the added vibrations can create stress on the wheel and cause
it to break.
	   The magazine said prosecutors had opened an investigation
against the two technicians who checked the ICE train on suspicion
of negligent manslaughter.
	   Prosecutor Juergen Wigger said they were considering whether
charges might also be brought against railway managers.

Poll shows Spaniards shift reaction to ETA's truce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Opinions are divided in Spain over the
sincerity of an armed Basque separatist cease-fire, according to an
opinion poll published Saturday.
	   The poll, published in the leading daily El Pais on the second
day of an indefinite cease-fire declared by the armed Basque
separatist group ETA, showed that 59 percent of Basques surveyed
think the truce is sincere while nineteen percent consider it a
trick.
	   Meanwhile, out of 800 people polled in the rest of the Spain, 25
percent see the cease-fire as a chance to lead to a lasting peace
and 57 percent said it is a campaign tactic in support of Basque
nationalist candidates.
	   The El Pais poll was carried out Sept. 18 by the private
Demoscopia firm, which interviewed 1,300 people, 500 of them in the
northern Basque region. The poll has a 3.4 percent margin of error,
El Pais said.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since it began
campaigning for Basque independence in 1968.
	   The group's announcement Thursday was greeted with optimism in
the region by Basque nationalist leaders. The Spanish government
expressed caution and skepticism over the separatist's offer and
demanded that ETA had to prove its declaration of cease-fire.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar cut a day short a visit to Peru
and was expected to arrive Saturday to Madrid for urgent
consultations with other political leaders.
	   This is the third ceasefire declared by ETA but the first
open-ended one. The last one was in 1996 and lasted for just one
week.

Singapore says Malaysian move to restrict airspace has little

ban not fully observed; RECASTS to CLARIFY impact refers to
military training. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore said Saturday that Malaysia's recent
move to restrict military planes from its airspace will have little
impact on its air force training and operations.
	   Malaysia banned Singaporean military and rescue-search planes
from its air space beginning Friday, reversing the previous blanket
approval for all such flights. Now, the flights require
case-by-case permission.
	   A statement from Singapore's Ministry of Defense said that the
air force has been going ahead with ``its usual training and
operational flights,'' although it has been observing the ban.
	   Malaysia's New Straits Times newspaper reported Saturday that
the Singapore air force was not fully observing the ban.
	   The newspaper quoted an unidentified Malaysian Defense Ministry
spokesman as saying that it was inevitable Singapore jets would
encroach on Malaysian airspace because the two states were so close
to each other.
	   Singapore military aircraft do not need to fly through Malaysian
airspace to proceed to their training grounds and the planes can
land and take off from its air bases by flying over water, it said.
	   The Malaysian decision was seen as an escalation of the
diplomatic wrangle that has gripped the neighboring Southeast Asian
nations for weeks.
	   The two countries have bickered recently over everything from
the relocation of a railroad border post to water supplies, for
which Singapore relies heavily on its northern neighbor.
	   Although no reason was given for the decision, Malaysian Defense
Minister Syed Hamid denied it was retaliation for the memoirs
published this week by Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew.
	   Malaysian politicians say the book, which accused the Malaysian
leadership of corruption, has hurt relations between the two
countries that were merged from 1963-65.
	   In past years, Malaysian residents and local government just
across the narrow Johor Straits separating the two countries have
complained about the loud noise from Singapore fighter jets.
	   But Singapore's Ministry of Defense said the new flight routes,
prompted by the ban, may cause more noise in that area.

Two suspects in embassy bombing to be prosecuted in Tanzania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RODRIQUE NGOWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Two suspects held in connection
with the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania will be
charged in a local court next week, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   Omar Mahita, head of the Tanzanian police, told the
Swahili-language daily Mtanzania that local detectives and FBI
agents have completed preliminary investgations and have asked the
Director of Public Prosecution to initiate criminal proceedings
against the two.
	   ``We shall prosecute these in Tanzania ... any time from next
week, but not after Monday or Tuesday,'' Mahita told the newspaper.
	   Earlier this week, Adadi Rajabu, Tanzania's director of criminal
investigation, said police were holding two principal suspects _ a
Tanzanian and a foreigner whose nationality he would not reveal.
	   The blast at the U.S. Embassy killed 11 people, all of them
Tanzanians or other Africans.
	   A nearly simultaneuous blast at the U.S. Embassy in neighboring
Kenya killed 247 people, including 12 Americans.
	   The United States has formally charged two suspects for the
murder of the 12 Americans and is seeking a third. The two are
being held in New York.
	   Over the last two weeks, Rajabu and his team have been involved
in intensive consulations with the Attorney General's office and
Rajabu in preparing the formal charges.
	   It is expected that the suspects will face charges of murder,
conspiracy and bombing.
	   Mahita said others who are still in detention in connection with
the bombing and who could not be linked with it will be released
soon.
	   ``There is no point to continue holding those we could not prove
their involvement in the incident. ... We shall consult with our
FBI partners to establish those we shall release,'' Mahita said.
	   Mahita did not name the two he said would be charged and would
only identify them as a Tanzanian from Zanzibar and a foreigner.
	   Criminal investigation director Rajabu said the three people
remaining in police custody possess what he called valuable
information that would assist investigators in their task.
	   Among the three is a prominent Dar Es Salaam businessman, Thomas
Lyimo, the owner of Tomy Spares Manufactures Ltd., a metal-working
shop where part of the bomb is said to have been assembled.
	   Police said Lyimo was uncooperative with Tanzanian investigators
and FBI agents when he was arrested and questioned during early
stages of the investigation.

Miyamoto keeps one-stroke lead after third round in ANA Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KITAHIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Katsumasa Miyamoto shot a
1-under-par 71 to keep his one-stroke lead Saturday, with one day
left in the 100 million yen (dlrs 746,000) ANA Open.
	   Aiming at his second career Japan PGA title, Miyamoto shot three
birdies against two bogeys over the 7,063-yard (6,427-meter),
par-72 Sapporo Golf Club course for a 54-hole total of 7-under 209.
	   Miyamoto said he held on to the lead ``just barely.''
	   ``I could play calmly in the first nine, but I felt kind of
nervous after the turn ... as I began to see that the victory was
within my reach,'' he said.
	   Keiichiro Fukabori shot a bogey-free 68, the day's best score,
for 6-under 210. Another shot behind was Stuart Appleby of
Australia, the winner of the Kemper Open in June, who had a 72.
	   Shigeki Maruyama also shot a 68 to share a three-way tie for
fourth at 4-under 212 with Nobuhito Sato and U.S. Open champion Lee
Janzen. Sato shot a 68 and Janzen a 72.
	   Another shot back at 213 were Taiwan's Chen Tze-chung and two
Japanese _ Kazuhiro Takami and Hajime Meshiai.
	   The winner Sunday will take home the top prize of 18 million yen
(dlrs 134,000).

New clashes as American envoy wraps up visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with new clashes near Ramallah,
Palestinian Cabinet statement, changes byline, overline &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Clashes broke out Saturday outside the West
Bank town of Ramallah, a day after fighting between supporters of
the militant Islamic group Hamas and Israeli soldiers left dozens
of Palestinians injured.
	   As a U.S. mediator prepared for a final round of talks with both
sides, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accused the Israeli
government of condoning violence by Jewish settlers against
Palestinians, and said such attacks were destroying prospects for
peace.
	   A Palestinian youth was shot dead two days earlier by a Jewish
settler near the West Bank village of Beitunia. The settler said he
acted in self-defense after his car was stoned; Palestinians said
the shooting was unprovoked. The settler is being held while
authorities investigate.
	   ``These crimes happen, and we haven't heard any denunciation of
such acts by the Israeli government,'' Arafat told his Cabinet late
Friday.
	   On the eve of the Jewish New Year, which begins at sundown
Sunday, Israel resealed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza
Strip amid warnings the Islamic militant group Hamas would try to
kidnap Israeli soldiers or detonate bombs in Israeli cities during
the two-day holiday.
	   Hamas has vowed to avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers Imad
and Adel Awadallah, top Hamas fugitives who were shot to death by
Israeli troops during a raid on their West Bank hideout.
	   In a memorial rally for the Awadallahs in their West Bank
hometown of El Bireh on Friday, about 3,000 demonstrators exhorted
Hamas bombmakers: ``Blow up Tel Aviv!'' Later, some of the marchers
swarmed toward and stoned Israeli troops outside a nearby
settlement, and the soldiers responded with a hail of rubber-coated
metal bullets.
	   Palestinian officials claimed 96 youths were wounded in Friday's
fighting, but extensive checks with hospitals confirmed an injury
figure of 32.
	   Saturday's clashes were on a much smaller scale. About 20 youths
on a highway overpass outside Ramallah tore down protective fencing
meant to keep them from stoning motorists below, and hurled rocks
at a passing army jeep. ``Allahu akhbar _ God is great!'' they
screamed.
	   The soldiers fired back tear gas, dispersing them. No injuries
were reported.
	   Later, near an Israeli checkpoint south of Ramallah, youths
threw stones at soldiers and burned tires, sending plumes of black
smoke into the air. The official Voice of Palestine said Israeli
troops had encircled the area.
	   Hamas supporters also planned to rally later Saturday in the
West Bank town of Hebron, which has been a frequent flashpoint for
violence.
	   Amid the tensions, U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was wrapping
up his latest mission. He was to meet Saturday night with Arafat in
Gaza and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, then leave
early Sunday, U.S. officials said.
	   The two sides are trying to reach agreement on a long-delayed
Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank and on
revised terms of a Palestinian crackdown on militants, as proposed
by Washington.

Congolese President Kabila flies to Libya, violating sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES lead and graf 10 with Kabila's leaving Libya; EDITS to
conform; new quote on talks graf 9; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Congolese President Laurent Kabila has made
a brief visit to Libya by air, violating U.N. sanctions on flying
to the North African country, the official Libyan news agency JANA
said Saturday.
	   Kabila's arrival Friday made him the sixth African leader to
have flown directly to Libya this month in accordance with an
Organization of African Unity decision to no longer honor the air
embargo.
	   The U.N. Security Council expressed its concern Friday that
African statesmen were repeatedly violating the sanctions.
	   Kabila expressed his support for the OAU policy, saying the
Congo believes ``the imposition of the embargo against Libya is
unjust,'' Libyan television reported, according to a British
Broadcasting Corp. transcript of the broadcast received in Cairo.
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 to try to
force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to surrender two suspects in
the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed 270 people. The sanctions also bar arms
sales, freeze some foreign assets and limit sales of oil industry
equipment.
	   At its June summit, the OAU urged members to ignore the embargo
when traveling to Libya for humanitarian or official reasons.
	   Visitors who respect the ban fly to Tunisia and cross overland
into Libya or take the ferry from Malta.
	   Kabila, whose government is fighting a rebellion in the eastern
part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, held talks with Gadhafi
and ``exchanged views on some issues of mutual concern,'' reported
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency.
	   Kabila flew out of Tripoli on Saturday, said JANA in a report
monitored by the BBC.
	   Libya asked the Arab League this week to join the OAU in
ignoring the sanctions. But the League decided, at a meeting of its
foreign ministers in Cairo, to adhere to the sanctions until an
agreement is reached with Libya on handing over the Lockerbie
suspects.
	   Libya's Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser denounced the
League's decision as a ``joke''.
	   The U.N. Security Council endorsed a U.S.-British plan for the
suspects to be tried in the Netherlands.
	   Libya agreed in principle, but has demanded negotiations to
ensure the suspects' legal rights and safety. The United States and
Britain have said the offer is non-negotiable.
	   The Security Council said the sanctions would be suspended when
the suspects were turned over for trial.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Rescuers lowered ropes from
helicopters Saturday to hoist up passengers who survived more than
12 hours in stormy seas after a Philippine ship sank with 430
people aboard. At least two people were killed. The coast guard
said 267 people, many covered in black oil from the ship, were
rescued by ships and helicopters after the Princess of the Orient
sank. More than 160 people were missing. In a radio broadcast, the
local governor appealed for help in saving people still floating in
the chilly water. The ship, with a capacity of 3,900 passengers,
sank in rough seas several hours after it left Manila for the
central city of Cebu. Tropical Storm Vicki, with 75 kph (45 mph)
winds, lay about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of Manila
late Friday. A crew member who did not give his name told The
Associated Press that the ship's cargo appeared to have suddenly
shifted to the left in the heavy seas. (PHILIPPINES-SHIP)
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ The Social Democrats, who built the Swedish
welfare state known as ``the people's home,'' appear set to remain
head of the household for another four years, polls ahead of
Sunday's national election show. Swedes won't give the party a
rousing mandate in the Sunday voting for the 349 seats in the
Riksdag parliament; A poll Friday published in the newspaper
Svenska Dagbladet showed the party getting support of just 36.8
percent, down from the 45 percent it got in the 1994 elections. The
Social Democrats would likely get the grudging support of the Left
and Green and parties, leaving Sweden with an awkward minority
government. Non-socialist parties, led by the Moderates of former
Prime Minister Carl Bildt, have hammered the Social Democrats with
the contention that Sweden will be marginalized if it continues to
support the welfare state with taxes that are the world's highest.
The conservative parties claim the socialists are holding onto an
outdated concept that ignores the cold realities of a globalizing
economy. (SWEDEN-ELECTION)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Setting in motion a historic event in
political and television history, the House Judiciary Committee is
preparing to disseminate President Bill Clinton's taped grand jury
testimony about his extramarital affair in the White House. If the
videotape is released as scheduled Monday morning, viewers will see
something they never imagined would appear on their TV screens:
normally secret grand jury testimony by a president, questioned
about his sex life. In addition to the four-hour video, the House
is to simultaneously disseminate 2,800 pages of material _ some of
it sexually graphic _ on the Internet and at a government bookstore
in Washington. All of the material on Clinton's affair with former
intern Monica Lewinsky was given to the House by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr, who was obligated to provide Congress with
``substantial and credible'' information on impeachable conduct by
Clinton. (US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police have detained several more dissidents,
human rights groups said Saturday, as authorities tightened their
repression of political dissent. Among the latest to be detained
was a Beijing labor organizer, a dissident based in northeastern
Jilin and another dissident who was trying to register an
opposition party in eastern Shandong, according to reports from the
rights groups and dissidents. Zhu Rui, a onetime political activist
who sought to organize protests by laid-off workers at her factory,
was taken away by police in the predawn hours Saturday morning, New
York-based Human Rights in China reported. The group said Zhu also
had been detained for 12 days during the visit to China of U.N.
human rights chief Mary Robinson, who left Beijing on Tuesday after
a 10-day visit. Liu Lianjun, one of many dissidents who have been
trying to register the China Democracy Party, an opposition group,
with the government was detained Saturday in eastern Shandong
province, a fellow dissident said. (CHINA-DISSIDENTS)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An adopted brother and a friend of
Malaysia's Anwar Ibrahim told a court Saturday that the outspoken
former deputy prime minister had sodomized them, testimony that
increases the likelihood of his arrest. Anwar, who was fired as
deputy prime minister earlier this month, has been accused of
committing unlawful sex acts, leaking state secrets and abusing his
powers. He has denied the allegations and told The Associated Press
that the confessions were obtained ``certainly under duress.''
Anwar's adopted brother, two friends and two former private
secretaries _ all men _ have been arrested since Sept. 6 as part of
a police investigation against Anwar. Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, who has ruled Malaysia for 17 years, has accused Anwar,
his former heir-apparent, of ``low morals.'' Anwar has campaigned
for reform of the judiciary, an end to political corruption, and in
the last few days, Mahathir's resignation. Growing crowds have
shouted support in unheard-of challenges to the authority of the
prime minister and the government's powers of summary arrest.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Michael Brennan breezed past
English defenders to score an extra time golden goal and push
Australia into the finals of the men's field hockey competition at
the Commonwealth Games on Saturday.
	   Locked 2-2 at the final whistle after a match that was
fast-paced but full of missed opportunities for both sides, Brennan
snatched the ball away during an English charge and zig-zagged his
way past two dazed defenders for the winning goal in the first
semifinal. The goal came in the second minute of extra time.
	   After a drab and barren first half, England came back from the
breather more energetic and began assaulting Australia immediately.
They struck in the 56th minute when Jon Wyatt deflected the ball
from Russell Garcia in a penalty corner.
	   But Australia retaliated within two minutes with Matthew Smith
equalizing with a field goal.
	   With minutes to go for the final whistle, the aggressive English
side was back in front with Garcia scooping a penalty corner shot
past the flailing arms of Australian goalkeeper Damon Diletti.
	   Australia equalized with Jeremy Hiskins exploiting a defensive
lapse to tap the ball into the English goal in the 72nd minute.
	   In the run up to the semis, Australia, which romped into the
semis topping Group A, has won four of its five matches, a shock
2-3 defeat by South Africa the only blemish in its campaign.
	   England, coached by former Australian star Barry Dancer, reached
the semifinal finishing second best to Malaysia in its pool. The
team may have had a better chance with the presence of penalty
corner specialist Calum Giles, who has been left out of the side
following the new rules prohibiting substitution during set-pieces.
	   Australia have beaten England twice this year _ 4-2 in the Azlan
Shah Tournament at Ipoh, Malaysia, and 3-0 at Utrecht, where
England was placed sixth, two places behind Australia.

Britons snap up Independent Counsel's report on Clinton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britons are snapping up the Starr Report, with its
graphic descriptions of President Clinton's extramarital liaisons
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   The first British company to publish the report of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr says 95,000 out of an initial print run of
100,000 copies sold within the first two days.
	   ''It is incredible. We have nothing to compare to this - not
even after (Princess) Diana died and we brought out a special
hardback book,'' said a spokeswoman for publishers Orion, who are
selling the report at 4.99 (dlrs 8).
	   ''All the big high street book shops are just clamoring for
copies,'' said the spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Orion already has made plans to print further copies.
	   Another edition of the Starr report, printed by Pocket Books, a
division of U.S. publisher Simon and Schuster, goes on sale in
Britain next week for 3.99 pounds (dlrs 6.40).
	   ''We have brought over 10,000 copies from the United States
today which will be out in the shops by next week,'' said a
spokesman.
	   ''Such has been the demand in the United States that we had to
re-print and couldn't get it earlier,'' said the spokesman,
speaking anonymously.
	   But the Bookseller's Association, which represents Britain's
book trade, believes demand will tail off soon.
	   ''The report is on the Internet, so people who are really
interested will have already seen it,'' said a spokesman.
	   Leading newsagent W.H. Smith, which has placed orders for 10,000
copies, is similarly cautious.
	   ''We will be watching this carefully as we don't know what the
British public will think about the book,'' said spokesman for the
company, which placed copies in 400 of its stores for the first
time on Saturday.
	   Their appetites whetted, Britons will be able to view film
footage of Clinton's grand jury evidence about the affair at the
same time as Americans Monday.
	   British Sky Television plans to screen the full four hours of
videotaped evidence, some of it rancorous, immediately it is
released for public view in the United States at 1300 GMT.
	   ''We will get it out as soon as we get it,'' said deputy head of
news Jim Rudder.
	   But he added that Sky will protect the sensibilities of children
watching at that time. ''We have a delay mechanism which will
ensure we can take out anything offensive,'' Rudder said.
	   Other channels have said they will screen highlights during news
bulletins.

German jailed in Iran says he will released this week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A German businessman jailed in Iran for
having a sexual relationship with a Muslim woman said Saturday he
expected to be freed in five days.
	   ``I think I will be released Thursday. I had hoped we would
finish today but I did not know it would take so long,'' Helmut
Hofer told reporters outside the courthouse.
	   His case was adjourned till Thursday. No other details were
available about Saturday's four-hour closed hearing.
	   Hofer, hand-cuffed and wearing pea-green prison uniform, asked
German Ambassador Horst Baechman to provide him with German books
and magazines as he was bored in prison.
	   Guards then took him back to prison in a police car.
	   Hofer was sentenced to death in January soon after his arrest
for having sex with 26-year-old medical student Vahideh Qassemi, to
whom he was not married. Qassemi attended Saturday's hearing.
	   Iranian law punishes sex between unmarried Muslims with
flogging, but if the man is a non-Muslim he faces the death
penalty.
	   Baechman and other consular officials were not allowed into the
courthouse Saturday.
	   The court had earlier reassured German officials that Hofer
would be freed because the court was satisfied he was a Muslim and
would marry the Iranian woman.
	   Iran has been keen to improve its relations with the European
Union, especially its top Western trade partner, Germany. Bonn had
warned Tehran that if Hofer were executed, German-Iranian relations
would deteriorate.
	   While there is no evidence that the government had influenced
the decision to retry Hofer, political considerations are generally
taken into account by Iranian courts.

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ With three blows of a hammer, Mayor
Christian Ude tapped the first keg of beer Saturday to open the
165th annual Oktoberfest, the world's biggest beer festival.
	   Organizers hope to top last year's attendance of 6.4 million
visitors at this year's event, despite record high prices for a
liter (quart) of beer: 11.30 marks (dlrs 6.70), up from a high of
10.40 marks (dlrs 6.19) last year.
	   The Oktoberfest, which runs until Oct. 4, also features carnival
rides, food stands and 94,000 seats in tents set up across the
Theresienwiese, a meadow in the center of Munich kept open just for
the annual bash.

killing about 40 people, the Interior Ministry said Saturday.
Authorities said preliminary indications were that the bus driver
was drunk.
	   The accident occurred Friday night near the Keshi train station
on the outskirts of Ashgabat, the capital of this former Soviet
republic in Central Asia.
	   The bus was so badly mangled that the precise number of dead
could not be immediately established. No further details were

Socialist bloc likely to keep power in Sweden, weakly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who built the
Swedish welfare state known as ``the people's home,'' are set to
remain head of the household for another four years, polls ahead of
Sunday's national election show.
	   A poll by the Temo organization published in the newspaper
Dagens Nyheter showed the Social Democrats and the Left Party
likely winning 177 seats in the 349-seat Riksdag, the national
parliament. A SIFO poll in Svenska Dagbladet said the socialist
parties combined with the Greens would get a majority of the seats.
	   Either constellation could be awkward for the Social Democrats
because the Left and the Greens oppose Sweden's membership in the
European Union and especially want the country to stay out of the
single European currency program.
	   The Left Party also clashes with the Social Democrats' efforts
at economic pragmatism. Over the past four years, the governing
party's cuts in public spending, aimed at extracting the country
from a crushing debt, has brought a decline in Sweden's
cradle-to-grave social welfare system, especially in the
once-admired medical system.
	   The Social Democrats have wrenched the economy into a reasonably
healthy position: the government predicts a small budget surplus
this year, inflation is barely detectable and unemployment,
although worrisome at 7.3 percent, has consistently fallen in
recent years.
	   But the cuts have alienated many of the party's traditional
supporters, whom analysts say have gravitated to the Left in hopes
of fully restoring the ``folkhem'' _ the ``people's home'' system
that in earlier decades was marked by full employment and social
services that cost recipients next to nothing out-of-pocket.
	   But the folkhem idea is more than an administrative system: to
Swedes, the term also has deep resonances of tolerance, cooperation
and modesty, and none of the seven parties likely to win
parliamentary seats wants to tear down the structure.
	   The main non-socialist party, the Moderates, just wants Swedes
to get out of the house more and into the globalizing economy. ``We
have to go beyond the folkhem,'' Moderates leader Carl Bildt said
in a TV debate with other party heads Friday.
	   Bildt argues that Sweden's high-tax ways will make the country
marginal and irrelevant in world competition. But even with the
80-billion-kronor (dlrs 10 billion) tax cut he proposes, Sweden's
tax burden would still be 50 percent of gross domestic product, one
of the world's highest figures.
	   The campaign has touched only occasionally on non-economic
issues and surveys have shown that unemployment is the top concern
among voters. Proposals for reducing it range from the Moderates'
tax cuts to jump-start the economy to the Left's call for cutting
the work-week to 35 hours.

Suharto's daughter says ex-president being treated unjustly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The daughter of ex-President Suharto
has demanded fair treatment for her father and his lawyer says the
former autocrat will cooperate with a corruption investigation,
Indonesian news reports said Saturday.
	   Opponents of the old autocrat accuse him of amassing billions of
dollars illegally and stashing a fortune in overseas bank accounts
before a wave of riots forced him to quit in May after 32 years in
power.
	   Following a new series of student protests, his successor
President B.J. Habibie has ordered an inquiry into the wealth of
Suharto and his family, who built huge business empires under his
patronage.
	   For months protesters, commentators, opposition figures and the
local media have accused the Suharto clan of indulging in gross
illegality, corruption and nepotism over three decades.
	   Calls for retribution against Suharto come as millions of
Indonesians grapple with soaring food prices, mass unemployment and
growing poverty while the worst economic crisis in 30 years grinds
on.
	   Earlier this month in a rare television appearance, Suharto said
he did not have ``a cent'' squirreled away in foreign banks
accounts. He challenged his critics to prove any wrongdoing.
	   In an interview with the newspaper Kompas, Suharto's eldest
millionaire daughter Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, commonly known as
Tutut, complained that her father and super-rich brothers and
sisters were being treated unjustly.
	   ``If we have done any wrong, we can be investigated in
accordance to the law. But we should not be judged unlawfully
because Indonesia is a country of laws. All people are equal before
the law,'' she said.
	   Tutut, who served briefly as a minister in her father's last
Cabinet before his resignation, has been one of Suharto's most
vocal supporters.
	   Victor Sulaiman Siregar, a lawyer for Suharto, said the
ex-president would soon visit the office of Indonesia's attorney
general as part of the inquiry.
	   Meanwhile, a senior military officer says a son-in-law of
Suharto could face a court-martial over allegations that he was
involved in the abductions of dozens of pro-democracy activists
during the months before Suharto's resignation.
	   Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, who commanded the military's elite
special forces unit, was fired from the armed forces last month
after a military tribunal implicated him in the kidnappings.
	   Ten other soldiers are to face courts-martial soon.
	   Several newspapers quoted military investigator Maj. Gen. Syamsu
Djalaluddin as saying he expected charges would also be filed
against Prabowo.

Congolese President Kabila flies to Libya, violating sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES lead and graf 10 with Kabila's leaving Libya; EDITS to
conform; new quote on talks graf 9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Congolese President Laurent Kabila has made
a brief visit to Libya by air, violating U.N. sanctions on flying
to the North African country, the official Libyan news agency JANA
reported Saturday.
	   Kabila's arrival Friday made him the sixth African leader to fly
directly to Libya this month in accordance with an Organization of
African Unity decision to no longer honor the air embargo.
	   The U.N. Security Council expressed its concern Friday that
African leaders were repeatedly violating the sanctions.
	   Kabila expressed his support for the OAU policy, saying the
Congo believes ``the imposition of the embargo against Libya is
unjust,'' Libyan television reported, according to a British
Broadcasting Corp. transcript of the broadcast received in Cairo.
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 to try to
force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to surrender two suspects in
the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed 270 people. The sanctions also bar arms
sales, freeze some foreign assets and limit sales of oil industry
equipment.
	   At its June summit, the OAU urged members to ignore the embargo
when traveling to Libya for humanitarian or official reasons.
	   Visitors who respect the ban fly to Tunisia and cross overland
into Libya or take the ferry from Malta.
	   Kabila, whose government is fighting a rebellion in the eastern
part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, held talks with Gadhafi
and ``exchanged views on some issues of mutual concern,'' reported
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency.
	   Kabila flew out of Tripoli on Saturday, said JANA in a report
monitored by the BBC.
	   Libya asked the Arab League this week to join the OAU in
ignoring the sanctions. But the League decided, at a meeting of its
foreign ministers in Cairo, to adhere to the sanctions until an
agreement is reached with Libya on handing over the Lockerbie
suspects.
	   Libya's Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser denounced the
League's decision as a ``joke''.
	   The U.N. Security Council endorsed a U.S.-British plan for the
suspects to be tried in the Netherlands.
	   Libya agreed in principle, but has demanded negotiations to
ensure the suspects' legal rights and safety. The United States and
Britain have said the offer is non-negotiable.
	   The Security Council said the sanctions would be suspended when
the suspects were turned over for trial.

Peris-Kneebone strikes gold again; Kenyan pacemaking earns 800
</HEADLINE>
triumph; Mutola wins women's race &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes, later finals &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Nova Peris-Kneebone, the first
Aboriginal to win an Olympic gold medal when she played on
Australia's field hockey team in Atlanta, added an athletic gold to
her collection Saturday when she triumphed in a thrilling finish to
the Commonwealth Games 200 meters.
	   In a desperate dash to the line to catch Juliet Campbell, the
Australian dipped and just caught the Jamaican by .02, clocking
22.77 seconds at the National Stadium.
	   Campbell clocked 22.79 with Australians third and fourth. Lauren
Hewitt just edged Melinda Gainsford-Taylor, who limped off with
what looked like a recurrence of her recent knee problems.
	   Kenya's Kennedy Ngetich ran a lap of honor with his gold
medal-winning teammate Japhet Kimutai despite placing last in the
800 meters after an extraordinary pacemaking triumph at the
Commonwealth Games.
	   Ngetich raced away from the other seven finalists at such speed
that they were strung out early in lap one. The plan was for him to
run the finishing speed out of South African Hezekiel Sepeng, the
South African Olympiuc silver medalist, and it succeeded as he
stayed well ahead for 500 meters.
	   Kimutai moved up onto his countryman's shoulder with just under
200 meters to go and then hit the front. As the rest of the field
also charged past the fading Ngetich, Kimutai was four meters clear
and held on to win the race in 1 minute, 43.82 seconds with Sepeng
second in 1:44.44 and fellow South African Johan Botha third in
1:44.57.
	   Ngetich trotted home last in 1:48.13.
	   ``He was going for pacing, and I would follow,'' Kimutai said.
``We knew what we were doing.''
	   Former world champion Maria Mutola led virtually all the way in
a Mozambique 1-2 finish in the women's 800 meters.
	   Mutola, also a three-time indoor world champion, clocked 1
minute, 57.60 seconds to beat her own Games record set in the
heats. Countrywoman Argentina Paulino took the silver in 1:58.39.
England's Diana Modahl, the 1990 titlist returning to the Games
after a positive drug test _ later ruled invalid _ ruled her out of
the '94 event, placed third in 1:58.81.
	   ``This is the first time Mozambique has participated in the
Commonwealth Games so it was very important that we take the
gold,'' Mutola said.
	   ``I'm really happy. I'm relieved,'' said bronze medalist Modahl,
who has campaigned for four years that she was innocent and is
suing the British Athletics Federation for damages.
	   ``I feel that this chapter is over. The fight is not over but
it's certainly an ending to the last four years.''
	   While Modahl finished third, there were English triumphs in the
men's 200 meters and high jump and women's long jump.
	   England's Julian Golding stayed in front of Christian Malcolm,
the world junior champion from Wales, and veteran John Regis, to
triumph in the 200 meters.
	   Golding led off the bend and held off a strong late charge from
Malcolm to win in 20.18. The youngster clocked 20.29 for the silver
and Regis, European champion back in 1990, won the bronze for
England in 20.40.
	   Dalton Grant leaped 2.31 meters to take gold in the high jump
while countryman Benjamin Challenger took the silver with 2.28 and
defending titlist Tim Forsyth of Australia wound up with the
bronze, also with 2.28 but more failures.
	   Joanne Wise won the women's long jump with a best leap of 6.63
meters in the third of the six rounds.
	   Jacqueline Edwards of the Bahamas leaped 6.59 in the final round
to snatch the silver from Australia's Nicole Boegman by .01.
	   Australia's defending champion, Louise McPaul, had the best six
throws of the competition and again took gold in the women's
javelin with a heave of 66.96 meters, more than 12 meters clear of
the field.
	   Karen Martin of England, whose best was 57.82, won the silver
and Kirsty Morrison placed third with 56.34.
	   Dinsdale Morgan of Jamaica produced the finishing speed in the
final 80 meters to pull away from Australia's Rohan Robinson and
win the 400-meter hurdles gold in a Games record 48.28.
	   Robinson clocked 48.99 and Zimbabwe's Kenneth Harnden got up to
take the bronze in 49.06.

Higo keeps sole lead after second round in Yukijirushi Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INABE, Japan (AP) _ Overnight leader Kaori Higo shot an
unimpressive 1-over-par 73 but managed to keep a one-stroke lead
Saturday after the second round in the 60 million yen (dlrs
448,000) Yukijirushi Ladies Tokai Classic.
	   Higo, seeking her first win of the season and sixth overall,
struggled with three bogeys against two birdies over the 6,351-yard
(5,779-meter) Ryosen Golf Club course for a 36-hole total of
4-under 140.
	   Aiko Takasu sank four birdies for a bogey-free 68 and came just
behind the leader at 3-under 141, tied with Michiko Hattori.
	   Hattori, who won the Japan LPGA Championship last week, had five
birdies against two bogeys for a 69.
	   Another shot behind at 142 was Akiko Fukushima, who shot five
birdies against one bogey, to be tied in fourth with Taiwan's Tseng
Hsiu-feng and two South Koreans Han Hee-won and Ku Ok-hee.
	   Han, in her second tournament as a pro after qualifying for the
Japan tour in August, shot a 72 and Ku 73.
	   Of a total of 108 players who teed-off Saturday, 61 survived the
cut.

Poll shows Spaniards shift reaction to ETA's truce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Opinions are divided in Spain over the
sincerity of an armed Basque separatist cease-fire, according to an
opinion poll published Saturday.
	   The poll was published in the leading daily El Pais on the
second day of an indefinite cease-fire declared by the armed Basque
separatist group ETA.
	   The poll showed that 59 percent of Basques surveyed think the
truce is sincere while nineteen percent consider it a trick.
	   Meanwhile, out of 800 people polled in the rest of the Spain, 25
percent see the cease-fire as a chance to lead to a lasting peace
and 57 percent said it is a campaign tactic in support of Basque
nationalist candidates.
	   The El Pais poll was carried out Sept. 18 by the private
Demoscopia firm, which interviewed 1,300 people, 500 of them in the
northern Basque region. The poll has a 3 percent margin of error,
El Pais said.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since it began
campaigning for Basque independence in 1968.
	   The group's announcement Thursday was greeted with optimism in
the region by Basque nationalist leaders. The Spanish government
expressed caution and skepticism over the separatist's offer and
demanded that ETA prove its declaration of cease-fire.

South Africa claims first cricket gold medal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout. EDITS &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ South African captain Shaun
Pollock lifted his young team to the first ever Commonwealth Games
cricket gold medal Saturday as it destroyed a full-strength
Australia by four wickets in the final.
	   Only Steve Waugh, with an unbeaten 90, stood firm against
Pollock's bowling as he claimed 4-19 in Australia's 183 all out.
South Africa reached 184-6.
	   Pollock's first spell of 3-12 removed Mark Waugh (2), Ricky
Ponting (2) and Adam Gilchrist (15), and he broke a 63-run stand
between Steve Waugh and Darren Lehmann (26) in his first over of a
second spell.
	   ``I'm chuffed. We've won the gold and I think the guys have
deserved a good party tonight,'' Pollock said.
	   South Africa, without stars such as Hansie Cronje, Allan Donald,
Jonty Rhodes and Brian McMillan, made a flying start to its run
chase against Australia's first-choice limited overs team. Openers
Andrew Hudson (36) and Mike Rindel set up the victory.
	   Nova Peris-Kneebone, the first Australian Aboriginal to win an
Olympic gold medal when a member of the victorious field hockey
team in Atlanta, added a Commonwealth track and field gold to her
collection Saturday. Peris-Kneebone stormed home with a desperate
lunge to finish in 22.77 seconds and beat Jamaica's Juliet Campbell
by .02 seconds.
	   England's Julian Golding stayed in front of Christian Malcolm,
the world junior champion from Wales, and veteran John Regis, to
triumph in the men's 200 meters.
	   Kenya's Kennedy Ngetich ran a lap of honor with his gold
medal-winning teammate Japhet Kimutai despite placing last in the
800 meters after an extraordinary pacemaking triumph.
	   Ngetich stretched the field and ran the speed out of South
Africa's Olympic silver medalist Hezekiel Sepeng.
	   Former world champion Maria Mutola led virtually all the way in
a Mozambique 1-2 finish in the women's 800 meters.
	   Mutola, also a three-time indoor world champion, clocked 1
minute, 57.60 seconds to beat her own Games record set in the
heats. Countrywoman Argentina Paulino took the silver in 1:58.39.
England's Diana Modahl, the 1990 titlist returning to the Games
after a positive drug test _ later ruled invalid _ was third in
1:58.81.
	   ``I'm really happy. I'm relieved,'' said bronze medalist Modahl,
who has campaigned for four years that she was innocent and is
suing the British Athletics Federation for damages.
	   ``I feel that this chapter is over. The fight is not over but
it's certainly an ending to the last four years.''
	   Australian Darryn Hill and Canada's Tanya Dubnicoff claimed the
men's and women's track cycling sprint events Saturday, both
winning their best of three finals 2-0.
	   Hill, the former world champion, was too strong for compatriot
Sean Eadie, while defending champion Dubnicoff continued her strong
form by beating world championship silver medalist Michelle Ferris
of Australia.
	   The shooting competition was overshadowed by news that a
Pakistani shooter had been summoned to the Commonwealth Games
doping control center Saturday for a second drugs test.
	   Bernama news agency, quoting a source it did not name, said the
shooter was asked to come to Kuala Lumpur immediately from Langkawi
Island, site of the games' shooting competition.
	   Dr. M. Jegathesan, chairman of the doping control center
subcommittee, declined to comment, citing prescribed procedures for
handling doping cases.
	   Australian Annemarie Forder won the women's air pistol final
with a games record of 480.6 points while compatriot Susan McCready
won the women's sport rifle final from Sharon Bowes of Canada and
Malaysia's Roslina Bakar.
	   India's Jaspal Rana beat South African Allan McDonald in a
shootout in the men's center-fire pistol final to take the gold.
	   Canadian weightlifter Akos Sandor, 21, took triple gold in the
men's 105-kilogram division. His 167.5-kg snatch eclipsed the old
Commonwealth Games mark by 7.5 kg, and his total of 360 beat the
previous record by 2.5. England's Tommy Yule claimed triple silver
while teammate Karl Grant snared a bronze in the clean and jerk and
New Zealander Nigel Avery took bronze in the snatch and total.
	   New Zealand's Darren Liddel doubled his country's gold tally
with a clean sweep in the over-105 kg category.
	   He never looked like faltering as he lifted 165 in the snatch
and 202.5 in the clean and jerk.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Rescuers lowered ropes from
helicopters Saturday to hoist up passengers who survived more than
12 hours in stormy seas after a Philippine ship sank with 430
people aboard. At least five people were killed.
	   The coast guard said 267 people, many covered in black oil from
the ship, were rescued by ships and helicopters after the Princess
of the Orient sank. More than 160 people were missing.
	   Only five bodies had been recovered by late afternoon, they
said.
	   In a radio broadcast, the local governor appealed for help in
saving people still floating in the chilly water.
	   The ship, with a capacity of 3,900 passengers, sank in rough
seas several hours after it left Manila for the central city of
Cebu. Dozens of relatives waited, some crying, outside the ship
company's office in Cebu for word of survivors.
	   The vessel, built in Japan in 1974 and bought second-hand in
1992, had been damaged in a fire in Manila harbor in 1997 and
repaired in Singapore. It is owned by Sulpicio Lines, which also
owned the Dona Paz, a ferry which collided with a tanker in 1987,
killing 4,341 in the world's worst peacetime shipping disaster.
	   The following year, 250 people died in the sinking of another
ship owned by the company, the Dona Marilyn.
	   A crew member who did not give his name told The Associated
Press that the Princess of the Orient's cargo appeared to have
suddenly shifted to the left in the heavy seas.
	   ``We did not have any warning,'' he said. ``The passengers were
unaware of what was happening. When they realized what was going
on, it was too late.''
	   Tropical Storm Vicki, with 75 kph (45 mph) winds, lay about 320
kilometers (200 miles) northwest of Manila late Friday.
	   Tomas Banzon, 25, a survivor picked up by a fishing boat, said
he was sleeping in the ship's economy section on the top deck at
about 10 p.m. when he heard shouting and felt his bed tilting.
	   He put on a life jacket, rushed outside and jumped into the
water, swimming quickly away to escape the ship's suction as it
sank, he said.
	   ``People were shouting, crying, calling out names,'' he said.
``I wanted to save them but I couldn't do anything.'' He said he
floated in the rough seas until about 4 a.m.
	   Geronimo Socrates, the skipper of the fishing boat, said he had
difficulty maneuvering the boat to the survivors because of the big
waves.
	   ``They were very scared. One of them clutched me and did not let
go. I told him, `Stay calm, we will save all of you.'''
	   Sulpicio Lines, which owns the ship, said it left Manila about 8
p.m. (1200 GMT) Friday for Cebu.
	   A few hours later it reported it was listing near Fortune island
off Batangas province, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) south of
Manila, and lost radio contact with its office in Manila around
12:30 a.m. Saturday, the company told naval authorities.
	   A military colonel on board called his aide in Manila by
cellular telephone late Friday and desperately asked for help, his
aide said.
	   For a second time Saturday, the company revised its count of the
number of people aboard. It said 338 passengers and 92 crew had
actually boarded the ship for a total of 430. No foreign names were
on the ship's manifest, coast guard spokesman Joel Garcia said.
	   A storm warning raised Friday prohibited ships of less than 500
tons from sailing but did not apply to the 13,734-ton Princess of
the Orient, Garcia said.
	   The storm also caused heavy flooding in many parts of the Manila
area.
	   Ships are the main mode of transportation among the Philippines'
more than 7,000 islands.

Report: Two killed as Nigerian police clash with Islamic sect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Running street battles between police and
members of a self-styled Islamic fundamentalist group resulted in
at least two deaths in the northern town of Kaduna, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   The clash involving members of the sect known as the Muslim
Brothers occurred Friday when police tried to break up a street
protest against the detention of the sect's leader, Sheikh Ibrahim
El-Zak Zaki, who is being tried for sedition, the Lagos Guardian
said.
	   Gunshots were heard and protesters threw rocks and debris at the
police. The identities of the two casualties were not known.
	   El-Zak Zaky was arrested two years ago for making illegal radio
broadcasts to his followers. Many of Nigeria's military leaders are
Muslims from the north, including the country's new military leader
Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar.

Four major banks plan to slash salaries by 20 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Struggling to survive the country's
economic crisis, four major commercial banks plan to cut salaries
by 20 percent, a Thai newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Bangkok Bank, Siam Commercial Bank, Thai Farmers Bank, the Bank
of Ayudhya have already submitted such cost-cutting plans to the
banks' labor unions, Worachart Asantarit, labor union president at
the Thai Farmers Bank was quoted as saying by The Nation.
	   If implemented, the cut would send another psychological shock
through the already battered economy since it involves at least
63,000 bank workers, he told the newspaper.
	   Worachat added that strikes might be called if the banks insist
on the pay reductions.
	   Despite a plea by bank managers for government intervention,
Bank of Thailand Gov. Chatu Mongol Sonakul has insisted that salary
cuts are unavoidable, given that Thai banks must compete with each
other and with foreign-owned domestic banks, the newspaper said.
	   ``We need to face reality. When we are poor, we cannot live as
the rich. We should hope that in the future when the economy turns
around, the problem of laying off employees can be solved,'' Chatu
Mongol said.
	   The newspaper said that rumors had spread that some banks would
also lay off employed because of losses and mounting bad loans.
	   Many Thai companies and individuals have been unable to repay
loans in wake of a collapse in domestic demand, cash flow and
credit following the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997.
	   Pairoj Varophas, senior executive vice president at the
stated-owned Krung Thai Bank, was quoted as saying by the newspaper
that the bank expected to lay off some management once it
accomplishes a merger with the First Bangkok City Bank and the
Bangkok Bank of Commerce.
	   He said the layoff was essential because the bank's employees
would swell from 15,000 to 19,000 due to the mergers.
	   To survive some commercial banks are planning other cost-cutting
measures.
	   Chaisith Soosomboon, labor union chairman at the Bangkok Bank,
was quoted as saying the bank's management has proposed early
retirement, not providing bonuses and freezing salaries and
allowances for the next three years.
	   The Bangkok Bank early this year encouraged about 2,000 officers
to retire early.

Hongkong Telecom employees protest wage cuts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TARA SUILEN DUFFY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Workers at Hong Kong's largest private employer
demonstrated Saturday to protest a 10 percent cut in their salaries
amid renewed fears about a wave of wage cuts in the territory.
	   Branding the across-the-board cuts as unnecessary for a
profitable company, about 75 employees of Hongkong
Telecommunications rallied, waving posters and chanting slogans.
	   ``We worry about such a profitable company trying to do this
salary cut,'' said Ip Kwok-fun, chairman of Hongkong Telecom Staff
Association, a union with 2,800 members.
	   The workers are planning to gather support for a petition on
Sunday and will demonstrate outside the company offices Monday, Ip
said.
	   The company announced the pay cut for all 13,800 employees
Thursday.
	   About two-thirds of the workers earn less than 20,000 Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 2,581) a month, Kwan Chi Nam, spokesman for the
staff association said.
	   The cuts are expected to save the company 300 million Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 38.46 million) a year.
	   Hours before the announcement, the government reported that
unemployment had reached a 15-year high of 5 percent in the three
months ending in August.
	   Talks between union leaders and Hongkong Telecom, a unit of
Britain's Cable and Wireless PLC, broke down Friday, as union
leaders rejected the company's revised salary-cut proposal.
	   Cutbacks have been expected at the company as part of its
efforts to meet requirements of the liberalization of the
telecommunications market next year.
	   Hongkong Telecom laid off 270 managers in July and had earlier
cut salaries of top executives by 20 percent.
	   Earlier this year, the company surrendered its monopoly on
international phone calls in exchange for a government payment of
U.S. dlrs 858 million.
	   Despite the cash pile, the company says the pay cuts are
necessary to offset a drop in international telecommunication
traffic and intense competition in the local mobile phone market.
	   Slashing wages at profitable companies is ``unjustified and
alarming,'' said a commentary in the South China Morning Post.
	   ``Hongkong Telecom's behavior should be an example to avoid
rather than a precedent for other companies to follow,'' it argued.
	   Legislator Lee Cheuk-yan of the Frontier Party said the
government should step in.
	   ``The Hong Kong government is one of the big shareholders of
Hongkong Telecom. So as a shareholder, they should have more weight
now,'' he told government-run radio.
	   The government bought shares of several blue-chip companies last
month in an attempt to deter speculators and stabilize the market.
	   Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa, commenting on the employment
situation on Friday, urged employers to be considerate to their
employees.
	   ``Employers must be caring to their employees in this adjustment
process,'' he said.

North Korea trains suicide bombers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea is training up to 140
suicide bomber pilots to plunge into key South Korean targets when
a war breaks out in the divided peninsula, a South Korean
government source said Saturday.
	   The high-ranking government official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the new unit appears to be fashioned after the
Japanese ``kamikaze'' pilots of World War II.
	   The official, involved in the government's civil defense
programs, said the North set up the suicide squads early this year
as a way of using its outdated Soviet-designed MiG-15 and MiG-17
jets.
	   Quoting intelligence data, the official said the new air unit
appeared to be under the direct command of North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il.
	   Kim is ruling North Korea as head of its belligerent 1.1
million-strong military, the world's fifth largest and the backbone
of the communist regime.
	   Officials at the Defense Ministry and the government's main spy
Agency for National Security Planning were unable to confirm
similar reports carried by South Korean news media.
	   Some Defense Ministry officials, however, downplayed those
reports, citing the fact that North Korea typically calls its
soldiers ``human bombs,'' ready to sacrifice their lives to defend
their ``Great Leader Kim Jong Il'' from ``U.S. imperialists and the
South Korea puppet.''
	   The two Koreas remain technically at war after their 1950-53
Korean War ended without a peace treaty. Their border is the
world's most heavily armed.
	   Some 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense treaty with the Seoul government.

Seven arrested protesting launch of nuclear sub
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARROW-IN-FURNESS, England (AP) _ Britain launched its fourth _
and probably last _ Trident nuclear submarine Saturday, to protests
from anti-nuclear campaigners.
	   Police arrested four men and three women in the early hours of
Saturday as they climbed the perimeter fence of the VSEL shipyard
in Barrow-in-Furness, northwest England, where the 16,000-ton HMS
Vengeance was awaiting launch, police Insp. Ian Robertshaw of
Cumbria police said.
	   Later, more than 200 other protesters from the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament jeered, banged drums and waved placards from a
bridge overlooking the shipyard as Sandra Robertson, wife of
Defense Secretary George Robertson, officially launched the HMS
Vengeance.
	   The 500 million-pound (dlrs-800) vessel, which will carry up to
16 nuclear missiles, is likely to be the last nuclear submarine in
Britain's fleet.
	   Speaking at the shipyard, Robertson said Saturday the new
submarine will enable the government ''to maintain a minimum, but
credible and effective nuclear deterrent.''
	   ''It is realistic in that we recognize that we must retain
strong defences against the uncertain and changing challenges of
the post Cold War world,'' he said.
	   But he added that Britain remains committed to nuclear
disarmament.
	   ''We will continue to press with greater urgency than has been
seen for years for multilateral negotiations towards mutual,
balanced and verifiable reductions in such weapons,'' he said.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan will enjoy economic growth of 2.5
for 1998, a rise of 0.3 percent from last year's rate, the Central
Bank of Jordan said Saturday.
	   The bank's annual report said inflation would hover around the
``acceptable'' level of 3.5 percent this year, provided that
reforms prescribed by the International Monetary Fund were
implemented.
	   Unofficially, inflation is set at 6 percent. The cost of living
index has remained constant for the past few years at an average of
5 percent.
	   The bank's report attributed the modest growth to several
factors, including political uncertainty over an
Israeli-Palestinian settlement and the low prices for oil which
have affected the remittances from Jordanian workers in the Gulf
region.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait and Zimbabwe have initialed a 30-year
renewable agreement for the protection of investments, the
Al-Siyassah newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The agreement guarantees freedom of movement for capital and
prevents governments from nationalizing investments without paying
enough compensation, the newspaper said quoting a finance ministry
official.
	   When the agreement with the ministry is finalized, it will have
to be sanctioned by Kuwait's 50-seat parliament.
	   Kuwait has finalized 20 such agreements, and ten others are in
the pipeline, Al-Siyassah said.
	   ____
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi trade delegation left for Syria on
Saturday, in the latest sign of warmer relations between the two
states, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   ``The visit aims to expand trade and economic cooperation with
Syria and to reopen the Iraqi Trade Center in Damascus,'' the
delegation leader, Farouk al-Obaidi of the Iraqi Trade Ministry,
told the news agency. The visit will last several days.
	   The Syrian government reopened a trade mission in Baghdad on
Sept. 3.
	   Syria and Iraq severed diplomatic ties after Damascus sided with
Tehran during the Iraq-Iran War of 1980-88.
	   Since the two states resumed cross-border trade last year, they
have done dlrs 150 million worth of business, the news agency said.
	   Iraq and Syria have yet to restore diplomatic ties.

Socialist bloc likely to keep power in Sweden, weakly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC;

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who built the
Swedish welfare state known as ``the people's home,'' are set to
remain head of the household for another four years, polls ahead of
Sunday's national election show.
	   A poll by the Temo organization published in the newspaper
Dagens Nyheter showed the Social Democrats and the Left Party
likely winning 177 seats in the 349-seat Riksdag, the national
parliament. A SIFO poll in Svenska Dagbladet said the socialist
parties combined with the Greens would get a majority of the seats.
	   Either constellation could be awkward for the Social Democrats
because the Left and the Greens oppose Sweden's membership in the
European Union and, in particular, want the country to stay out of
the single European currency program.
	   The Left Party also clashes with the Social Democrats' efforts
at economic pragmatism. Over the past four years, the governing
party's cuts in public spending, aimed at extracting the country
from a crushing debt, has brought a decline in Sweden's
cradle-to-grave social welfare system, especially in the
once-admired medical system.
	   The Social Democrats have wrenched the economy into a reasonably
healthy position: the government predicts a small budget surplus
this year, inflation is barely detectable and unemployment,
although worrisome at 7.3 percent, has fallen in recent years.
	   But the cuts have alienated many of the party's traditional
supporters, whom analysts say have gravitated to the Left in hopes
of fully restoring the ``folkhem'' _ the ``people's home'' system
that in earlier decades was marked by full employment and social
services that cost recipients next to nothing out-of-pocket.
	   But the folkhem idea is more than an administrative system: to
Swedes, the term also has deep resonances of tolerance, cooperation
and modesty, and none of the seven parties likely to win
parliamentary seats wants to tear down the structure.
	   The main non-socialist party, the Moderates, just wants Swedes
to get out of the house more and into the global economy. ``We have
to go beyond the folkhem,'' Moderates leader Carl Bildt said in a
TV debate with other party heads Friday.
	   Bildt argues that Sweden's high-tax ways will make the country
marginal and irrelevant in world competition. But even with the
80-billion-kronor (dlrs 10 billion) tax cut he proposes, Sweden's
tax burden would still be 50 percent of gross domestic product, one
of the world's highest figures.
	   The campaign has touched only occasionally on non-economic
issues and surveys have shown that unemployment is the top concern
among voters. Proposals for reducing it range from the Moderates'
tax cuts to jump-start the economy to the Left's call for cutting
the workweek to 35 hours.

Queen's father recovering well following urinary bladder operation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Prince Bernhard, the father of
Dutch Queen Beatrix, underwent surgery on his urinary bladder
Saturday and was recovering well, according to a Royal House
statement.
	   The operation was necessary due to complaints caused by leftover
scar tissue from a 1982 operation.
	   The 87-year-old prince will remain in the Academic Hospital in
the central Dutch city of Utrecht a few more days, said the
statement.
	   The usually jaunty prince already had two other operations this
year, one to repair a partially detached retina in his left eye and
another to treat an enlargement of the prostate.

Bohn stays in lead after Japan Cup fourth round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Parker Bohn III kept his lead in the fourth round
Saturday, becoming the top qualifier to advance to Sunday's
championship round finals in the 14th annual Oronamin C Japan Cup.
	   Bohn had a 169-pin lead with a total pinfall of 8,675 after the
fourth round of an invitational all match play tournament among the
top 16 players each from the U.S. Professional Bowlers Association
and its Japanese counterpart at Tokyo Port Bowl.
	   Bohn, a 16-time PBA champion who leads the Tour this year with
three wins, had a field-best 24-7-1 match play record and averaged
248 for his 32 games. Bohn won the event in 1992.
	   Walter Ray Williams Jr. qualified for second.
	   The reigning PBA Player of the Year from Orlando, Florida,
posted a 19-11-2 record, with a total pinfall of 8,506.
	   Steve Jaros, of Bolingbrook, Illinois, came in third for the
championship round at 8,378, with a match play record of 21-11.
	   Defending champion Doug Kent, of Canandaigua, New York, was tied
with Tommy Delutz Jr. for fourth place after round four. Kent beat
Delutz in a one-game roll-off for the No. 4 seed.
	   Delutz of Flushing, New York will face first-time Japan Cup
qualifier Brian Himmler of Cincinnati, Ohio in the opening match of
the championship round Sunday.
	   Delutz went 23-9 in match play, and Himmler 21-10-1, finishing
just one pin behind both Kent and Delutz with a total of 8,325
pinfall.
	   The 32 bowlers competed Saturday in the final fourth round of
match play before the field was trimmed to the top six for Sunday's
championship round.
	   The 20 million yen (dlrs 150,000) event offers a top prize of 5
million yen (dlrs 37,600).

Taiwan closes pornographic Web site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Police shut down Saturday what they said
was Taiwan's largest pornographic Internet Web site, which had
attracted some 30,000 people daily.
	   Police said they arrested Ko Rwei-huang at his home in the
southern port city of Kaohsiung on charges of running the Web site,
which provided nude photographs of underage girls and other
pornography.
	   Police say Ko, 23, earned more than 200,000 Taiwan dollars (U.S.
dlrs 5,800) a month by collecting fees from foreign advertisers.
	   Ko told reporters he started the business in February after
seeing an ad to lease a Web site operated from California in the
United States.
	   Police have begun a crackdown on Internet pornography after many
parents complained about children's easy access to such material.

<TEXT>
	   UMAN, Ukraine (AP) _ This small town in central Ukraine used to
be like hundreds of others throughout the country just eight years
ago. But these days, Uman is crowded with Hasidic Jews turning out
in ever-growing numbers for what has become a major annual event.
	   Thousands of Hasidim arrived in Uman this month to celebrate the
Jewish New Year at the 19th-century grave of their spiritual
leader, Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav.
	   On Friday, two days before the year 5759 was to begin, the area
around the grave _ hidden in a dilapidated barn among old village
houses and Soviet-era apartment houses _ was alive with Jewish
prayer and chants.
	   Bratslav Hasidim of all ages, from 22 countries, were arriving
in an unceasing flow to honor Nachman's testament to come to his
grave at Rosh Hashana, or New Year, which was to begin Sunday
night.
	   ``Why do you think people come here?'' said Daniel Brock, who
traveled to Uman from Zefat, Israel. ``Because there is a God, and
the rabbi who is buried here has understood the wisdom of God.''
	   ``You have to believe to understand why we come here and what we
are,'' added Eliyahu Abuaziz, who came to Uman from London.
	   Some Hasidim seem so submerged in religious ecstasy that
policemen guarding the area at times have to gently push a few
believers closer to the pavement as a bus or a car approaches.
	   Local residents have mixed feelings about the visitors' company.
On the one hand, they seem suspicious of the strangers, who stand
apart in their black clothes and hats and unfamiliar traditions.
	   On the other hand, the arrival of thousands of pilgrims has
created a money-raising opportunity for the residents of Uman, 180
kilometers (110 miles) south of the capital Kiev, most of them
impoverished by Ukraine's continuing economic decline.
	   They dash in dozens to every arriving bus, trying to gather a
half-dozen Hasidim and rent them apartments for dlrs 6 to 8 per
person, or to sell them fur hats and trifles like alarm clocks or
china.
	   Elderly women, surrounded by Hasidim, can be seen haggling
intensely over the price, while those more shy are just looking
around with hope and holding placards reading ``nine rooms, six
persons,'' or similar inscriptions.
	   The Hasidic feast serves as a reminder of what Uman was like
before the Nazi occupation in 1941, when some 40 percent of the
city's populace was Jewish. Today, only a few hundred Jews remain
among the city's population of 100,000.
	   Policemen registering the arriving Hasidim said more than 5,000
of them, or about the same number as last year, would be in Uman by
the start of Rosh Hashana at sundown Sunday.
	   But many others stay without paying a dlrs 3 registration fee,
and both locals and Hasidim, who have celebrated Rosh Hashana in
Uman more than once, acknowledge that the number of arriving guests
grows every year.
	   During the decades of Soviet rule, Nachman's followers made
their way secretly to Uman, under fear of oppression from the
authorities. But since the 1991 Soviet collapse, the celebration
has no longer been prohibited.
	   In a sign that times have changed, a new synagogue with pools
for ritual bathing is being constructed near Nachman's grave.
	   This unfinished metal structure seems to cause the biggest
headache for police brought to Uman to guard the festivities.
	   Many Hasidim were desperate to enter the synagogue already this
year, and Ukrainian-speaking guards took great pains to divert
impatient believers from the site.

Iran expects to bring home 5 prisoners from Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian diplomat was traveling to
Afghanistan on Saturday to bring home five Iranians held prisoner
by the Taliban militia, Iranian state radio reported.
	   Tehran radio said a diplomat from the embassy in the Pakistani
capital of Islamabad would travel to Kandahar, southeast
Afghanistan, to receive the men.
	   The Taliban, who released five Iranian prisoners in a goodwill
gesture earlier this month, had promised to release another five.
	   The Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, claims
its 50 Iranian captives were arrested for supplying weapons to its
opponents, who are based in the north of the country.
	   Iran says most of the prisoners are truck drivers who were
transporting emergency relief goods. Iran also accuses the Taliban
of holding about 60 Iranians.
	   Tensions between Iran and Afghanistan have risen sharply since
the Taliban admitted Sept. 10 that its militiamen had killed eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist after capturing the northern
city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban returned seven of the nine bodies to Tehran on
Monday.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan.
	   Taliban leaders say they have rushed troops to the frontier
region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   Iran is suspected of backing Afghanistan's opposition, which
largely represents the country's minority ethnic and religious
groups, including minority Shiite Muslims.

Police pick up 18 people on suspicion of terrorism

	   ENTEBBE, Uganda (AP) _ Police in Uganda have detained 18 people,
including a prominent merchant, on suspicion they were planning
attacks on American and other foreign diplomatic missions and
Ugandan government installations, a senior official said Saturday.
	   ``They wanted to hit key installations, not only American but of
the Ugandan government. We have all the documentary material on
their operations,'' said David Pulkol, Director of Internal
Security.
	   Among those arrested was businessman Ahamed Mandela, who is also
financial secretary of the Express Football Club.
	   Pulkol said most of the arrests were made in the capital,
Kampala, over the past 15 days.
	   He did not give more details.
	   Another security source, who could not be further identified,
said six of the 18 were detained in Kasase district in western
Uganda and the other 12 were picked up in Kampala.
	   The source said many of those detained were Somalis or of Somali
background.
	   Five diplomatic missions in Kampala, including the U.S. Embassy,
the Danish Embassy and the British High Commission, were closed at
the beginning of the week following a series of threatening
telephone calls.
	   On Thursday night, Lucy Maria Carpenter, 34, a British
researcher working at the Virus Research Institute in Entebbe, was
shot in the head as she drove through Kampala. She was rushed to
Mulango Hospital and later moved to South Africa.
	   Since the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in neighboring
Kenya and Tanzania _ in which 257 people, including 12 Americans,
died _ the U.S. Embassy and the British High Commission, which
share a common compound, have been closed more often than they have
been open.
	   A Tanzanian newspaper said Saturday that two suspects, a
Tanzanian from Zanzibar and an unidentified foreigner, would be
charged next week in the Dar es Salaam bombing.
	   U.S. officials have charged two suspects in connection with the
Nairobi bombing, and they are being held in New York. A third was
reported arrested in Germany Wednesday, a fourth was arrested in
Texas and a fifth is a fugitive and being sought.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Attackers fired a rocket at a police
station in downtown Istanbul on Saturday, causing damage but no
injuries, Turkey's Anatolia news agency said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
	   A similar attack on a police station last year was claimed by a
leftist underground group, the Revolutionary People's Salvation
Party Front. That attack slightly injured two policemen.
	   Radical Islamic groups and Kurdish rebels also are active in
Istanbul.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl, behind in the polls
for months in his bid for an unprecedented fifth term, got some
good news from polls released Saturday _ one week before the
national election.
	   A poll of 1,200 eligible voters for the newsmagazine Focus
showed Kohl's conservative union parties holding steady at 38
percent, while challenger Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats
dropped a point from the month before to 41 percent.
	   Another survey conducted for several newspapers and ARD public
television found Kohl's approval ratings at the highest level in 11
months _ 42 percent, up seven points from the week before.
	   That survey of 1,300 voters put the Social Democrats at 40.5
percent, down 1.5 points, and Kohl's union at 38 percent, up one.
	   No margin of error was given for either survey.

Bank workers protest rising layoffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of bank employees joined
other white-collar workers in a rally in Seoul Saturday, vowing to
go on strike to protest layoffs.
	   Thousands of riot police were deployed to guard against
violence. But no clashes or arrests were reported.
	   ``The government stop killing bank workers!'' some 5,000
protesters chanted in a downtown park.
	   The workers later marched along the sidewalks, carrying
anti-government slogans such as ``Down with President Kim
Dae-jung!''
	   Kim's administration is pushing mergers between large commercial
banks to make the bad-debt-ridden South Korean banks more
efficient. The restructuring will include layoffs, government
officials said.
	   On Saturday, the protesters said at least nine of the country's
27 commercial banks will go on strike on Sept. 29 unless the
government guarantees job security.
	   ``Our patience is running out. We will have no choice but to
launch an all-out battle against the government,'' said union
leader Choo Won-sok to loud applause.
	   When the economy slowed down and companies began collapsing last
year, banks were left with mounds of bad loans, prompting a sudden
loss of international confidence that led to South Korea's
financial crisis.
	   South Korea was forced to accept a dlrs 58 billion bailout fund
from the International Monetary Fund in December. In return, the
nation is required to reform its bloated industrial and financial
sectors.
	   The government has shut down 14 troubled merchant banks and five
small commercial banks.
	   It now is promising to write off bad loans and offering tax
benefits to expedite mergers between big commercial banks. Since
July, six banks have announced merger agreements.
	   South Korea's unemployment rate has risen to a 32-year high of
7.6 percent, with 1.65 million people out of work.

Two die in prison brawl
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ A brawl broke out among 30 inmates during lunch at
a prison in this Portuguese enclave, and two prisoners were killed,
officials said.
	   Two inmates were seriously injured in the fighting, said Daniel
Ferriera, security chief of Macau's Central Prison.
	   He said the prisoners hit each other with stools and eating
utensils. The cause of the brawl was not immediately known.
	   The prison houses several hundred inmates, many of them gang
members.
	   Macau, a tourist and gambling spot at the tip of south China,
has been hit recently by a spate of gangland-style killings and
arson attacks.
	   Police say they believe the violence is linked to gang wars over
gambling profits that have been shrinking because of Asia's
economic slump.
	   The enclave reverts to Chines rule next year. On Friday, China
announced that it will station elite troops in the territory after
the handover to keep order.

Israel-Myanmar gems center opens in Myanmar capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A center built jointly by Israeli and
Myanmar enterprises to produce top quality jewelry for export has
been opened in the Myanmar capital Yangon, an official release said
Saturday.
	   The six-story building, which opened Friday, will house jewelry
stores, gems polishing, cutting and carving workshops and a gems
training school.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, is one of the world's major
sources for top quality rubies, emeralds and sapphires.
	   In recent years the government has tried to stop gems smuggling
and to improve its gems processing and marketing.
	   ``Applying advanced Israeli methods and using modern tools, the
joint venture will produce the finest quality jewelry to win the
best prices in world markets,'' the release sent to Bangkok said.
	   It said that Israeli experts had been training Myanmar gems
workers in Yangon for five months.
	   The center is a joint venture between the Union of Myanmar
Economic Holdings Ltd. and Ram Trade and Investment Co. Ltd. of
Israel. It was set up with an initial capital of dlrs 4 million.
	   Construction, which began in 1996, has been completed up to the
third floor, the release said.

Swiss raise dlrs 4 million for southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A day-long fund-raising campaign for
victims of the war and famine in southern Sudan raised nearly 6
million Swiss francs (dlrs 4 million), organizers said Saturday.
	   The Chain of Fortune said it expected the final total to the
appeal to be much higher.
	   Organizers said all 105 telephone lines were constantly busy
taking pledged donations during Friday's televised fund-raising
effort.
	   The money will be primarily used for Swiss-run projects in the
worst affected regions.
	   Switzerland, with its population of 7 million people, often has
fund-raising blitzes for international disasters and national
charities.
	   U.N. officials say the daily number of people dying as a result
of war-induced malnutrition may have peaked but have warned that
hundreds of thousands are still at risk.

Peris-Kneebone strikes gold again; Kenyan pacemaking earns 800
</HEADLINE>
triumph; Mutola wins women's race; Kenyans sweep 5,000 meters &QL;

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Nova Peris-Kneebone, the first
Aboriginal to win an Olympic gold medal when she played on
Australia's field hockey team in Atlanta, added an athletics gold
to her collection Saturday when she triumphed in a thrilling finish
to the Commonwealth Games 200 meters.
	   In a desperate dash to the line to catch Juliet Campbell, the
Australian dipped and just caught the Jamaican by .02, clocking
22.77 seconds at the National Stadium.
	   Campbell clocked 22.79 with Australians third and fourth. Lauren
Hewitt just edged Melinda Gainsford-Taylor, who limped off with
what looked like a recurrence of her recent knee problems.
	   ``I had no idea. I wanted to see it up on the scoreboard,''
Peris-Kneebone said. ``I knew it was extremely close.
	   ``It's like when I won my hockey gold medal, I just couldn't
believe it until later on.
	   ``It's unreal. I'm going to have to sit down by myself and think
about it. It hasn't sunk in yet,'' said the Australian, who praised
the work of American sprint coach John Smith to turn her into a
top-quality track athlete.
	   ``He's taken me from running really bad to putting everything in
the right direction. I've come a long way in the last 18 months.''
	   Peris-Kneebone's triumph was one of three golds for the
Australians, while England also won three. With Jane Saville's
triumph in the early morning in the women's 10-kilometer walk, the
Australians lead the athletics medal count with nine golds while
the English have seven.
	   The Kenyan runners also had a standout day.
	   Kenya, led by former world record holder Daniel Komen, had a
sweep of the 5,000 meters medals and Kennedy Ngetich ran a lap of
honor with his gold medal-winning teammate Japhet Kimutai despite
placing last in the 800 meters after an extraordinary pacemaking
triumph.
	   Ngetich raced away from the other seven finalists at such speed
that they were strung out early in lap one. The plan was for him to
run the finishing speed out of South African Hezekiel Sepeng, the
South African Olympiuc silver medalist, and it succeeded as he
stayed well ahead for 500 meters.
	   Kimutai moved up onto his countryman's shoulder with just under
200 meters to go and then hit the front. As the rest of the field
also charged past the fading Ngetich, Kimutai was four meters clear
and held on to win the race in 1 minute, 43.82 seconds with Sepeng
second in 1:44.44 and fellow South African Johan Botha third in
1:44.57.
	   Ngetich trotted home last in 1:48.13.
	   ``He was going for pacing, and I would follow,'' Kimutai said.
``We knew what we were doing.''
	   Komen raced away from teammates Thomas Nyariki and Richard Limo
with two laps to go to cruise to victory in 13:22.57. Nyariki
clocked 13:28.09 and Limo was almost 15 seconds behind the winner
in third place.
	   Former world champion Maria Mutola led virtually all the way in
a Mozambique 1-2 finish in the women's 800 meters.
	   Mutola, also a three-time indoor world champion, clocked 1
minute, 57.60 seconds to beat her own Games record set in the
heats. Countrywoman Argentina Paulino took the silver in 1:58.39.
England's Diana Modahl, the 1990 titlist returning to the Games
after a positive drug test _ later ruled invalid _ ruled her out of
the '94 event, placed third in 1:58.81.
	   ``This is the first time Mozambique has participated in the
Commonwealth Games so it was very important that we take the
gold,'' Mutola said.
	   ``I'm really happy. I'm relieved,'' said bronze medalist Modahl,
who has campaigned for four years that she was innocent and is
suing the British Athletics Federation for damages.
	   ``I feel that this chapter is over. The fight is not over but
it's certainly an ending to the last four years.''
	   While Modahl finished third, there were English triumphs in the
men's 200 meters and high jump and women's long jump while
Australia's world record holder, Emma George, won the first
Commonwealth Games pole vault.
	   England's Julian Golding stayed in front of Christian Malcolm,
the world junior champion from Wales, and veteran John Regis, to
triumph in the 200 meters.
	   Golding led off the bend and held off a strong late charge from
Malcolm to win in 20.18. The youngster clocked 20.29 for the silver
and Regis, European champion back in 1990, won the bronze for
England in 20.40.
	   Dalton Grant leaped 2.31 meters to take gold in the high jump
while countryman Benjamin Challenger took the silver with 2.28 and
defending titlist Tim Forsyth of Australia wound up with the
bronze, also with 2.28 but more failures.
	   Joanne Wise won the women's long jump with a best leap of 6.63
meters in the third of the six rounds.
	   Jacqueline Edwards of the Bahamas leaped 6.59 in the final round
to snatch the silver from Australia's Nicole Boegman by .01.
	   George, whose world mark is 4.59 meters, climbed to a modest
4.20 to easily win the pole vault ahead of South Africa's Emarie
Gerryts and Canada's Trista Bernier, who both cleared 4.15.
	   Australia's defending champion, Louise McPaul, had the best six
throws of the competition and again took gold in the women's
javelin with a heave of 66.96 meters, more than 12 meters clear of
the field.
	   Karen Martin of England, whose best was 57.82, won the silver
and Kirsty Morrison placed third with 56.34.
	   Dinsdale Morgan of Jamaica produced the finishing speed in the
final 80 meters to pull away from Australia's Rohan Robinson and
win the 400-meter hurdles gold in a Games record 48.28.
	   Robinson clocked 48.99 and Zimbabwe's Kenneth Harnden got up to
take the bronze in 49.06.

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The state-owned Bahrain Petroleum Co. has
awarded a dlrs 45 million contract to Japan's engineering and
construction company JGC Corp. to upgrade the oil blending system
at its aging refinery, a company official said Saturday.
	   Bapco's chief executive, Johann Flubbe, told The Associated
Press that JGC Corp. won the contract over three other
international companies _ the U.S. Raytheon Engineers &AMP;
Construction, Foster Wheeler, Stone &AMP; Webster.
	   Under the contract, JGC Corp. will carry out the engineering,
procurement and construction of the new in-line oil blending
project worth dlrs 65 million, Flubbe said.
	   The project, which will become operational by mid-2000, will
increase the value of oil products by about dlrs 17.5 million a
year and is expected to bring a one-time saving of dlrs 14.2
million by reducing storage tank repair costs and inventory sales.
	   Flubbe said the project would be financed through banks.
	   Last July, the government approved a plan to spend dlrs 400
million over four years to modernize the 62-year-old refinery.
However, last week the Oil Minister Sheik Isa bin Ali Al Khalifa
said the modernization would cost dlrs 800 million.
	   The refinery was built in 1936, four years after the discovery
of oil in Bahrain. It has an output capacity of 250,000 barrels per
day. Owned by the government, it is the island's only refinery.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and the Palestinians on Saturday
agreed on closer cooperation in trade, agriculture and transport in
a bid to reduce Palestinian dependence on Israeli trade.
	   A memorandum signed after 90 minutes of high-level discussions
said 88 new commodities will be added to list of goods exchanged
between the two sides free of tax.
	   It did not specify the number or say what goods are currently
exchanged between Jordan and the West Bank, but stressed that the
Palestinians will provide a complete list of the goods to Israel
for approval within two weeks.
	   Jordan and the Palestinians have complained that Israel has
hindered trade between them by delays and bureaucratic procedures
it imposes on border points under its control.
	   In 1995, a broad cooperation agreement between Jordan and the
Palestinians set annual trade exchange at dlrs 300 million. But
since, the actual figure did not exceed one tenth the figure.
	   Palestinian trade with Israel is estimated at dlrs 3 billion
annually.
	   The memorandum, which was made available to The Associated
Press, was signed by Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh and Mahmmoud
Abbas, a senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

Shooting in Monrovia as troops surround ex-rebel leader's home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Gunfire rattled through downtown
Monrovia on Saturday, after government troops reportedly surrounded
the home of former warlord Roosevelt Johnson and called for the
arrest of armed dissidents.
	   There were unconfirmed reports of several casualties in the
Liberian capital and witnesses said some shops and offices had been
looted. Streets were nearly deserted as frightened residents
shuttered the doors to their homes outside Johnson's residence,
which is heavily guarded by his former rebel soldiers.
	   In a radio broadcast, Information Minister Joe Mulba called on
residents to report ``dissident'' forces to authorities so they
could be arrested.
	   Taylor's personal military security unit has been involved in
clashes on several occasions in recent months with Johnson's
supporters, who accuse the president of trying to kidnap and
assassinate their leader.
	   Many Liberians have vivid memories of the country's seven-year
civil war that left 150,000 people dead and prompted countless
thousands more to flee their homes.
	   Johnson is a former arch-foe of Taylor, but the two were among a
number of warlords who signed a fragile truce in 1996. Johnson
returned from exile to become Liberia's rural development minister
after Taylor won last July's presidential elections.
	   Earlier this year, Johnson ignored an offer from Taylor to
become Liberia's first ambassador to India.

	   ENTEBBE, Uganda (AP) _ Police in Uganda have detained 18 people,
including a prominent merchant, on suspicion they were planning
attacks on American and other foreign diplomatic missions and
Ugandan government installations, a senior official said Saturday.
	   ``They wanted to hit key installations, not only American but of
the Ugandan government. We have all the documentary material on
their operations,'' said David Pulkol, Director of Internal
Security.
	   Among those arrested was businessman Ahamed Mandela, who is also
financial secretary of the Express Football Club.
	   Pulkol said most of the arrests were made in the capital,
Kampala, over the past 15 days.
	   He did not give more details.
	   Another security source, who could not be further identified,
said six of the 18 were detained in Kasase district in western
Uganda and the other 12 were picked up in Kampala.
	   The source said many of those detained were Somalis or of Somali
background.
	   Five diplomatic missions in Kampala, including the U.S. Embassy,
the Danish Embassy and the British High Commission, were closed at
the beginning of the week following a series of threatening
telephone calls.
	   On Thursday night, Lucy Maria Carpenter, 34, a British
researcher working at the Virus Research Institute in Entebbe, was
shot in the head as she drove through Kampala. She was rushed to
Mulango Hospital and later moved to South Africa.
	   Since the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in neighboring
Kenya and Tanzania _ in which 258 people, including 12 Americans,
died _ the U.S. Embassy and the British High Commission, which
share a common compound, have been closed more often than they have
been open.
	   A Tanzanian newspaper said Saturday that two suspects, a
Tanzanian from Zanzibar and an unidentified foreigner, would be
charged next week in the Dar es Salaam bombing.
	   U.S. officials have charged two suspects in connection with the
Nairobi bombing, and they are being held in New York. A third was
reported arrested in Germany Wednesday, a fourth was arrested in
Texas and a fifth is a fugitive and being sought.

Iranian newspaper columnist arrested
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The political columnist for Tous, a banned
Iranian newspaper, was arrested Saturday, the third detention
involving the newspaper in less than a week, colleagues said.
	   Seyed Ebrahim Nabavi went to court after receiving a summons and
was arrested, said colleagues, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The paper's managing director, Mohammad Mohsen Sazgara, had said
earlier that Nabavi was picked up Friday.
	   Tous, a liberal newspaper with the second-highest circulation in
Iran, was shut down Wednesday for publishing articles detrimental
``to the country's national interests and security.'
	   Editor Mahmoud Shams and Hamid Reza Jalaipur, director of its
publishing company, were also arrested Wednesday.
	   Tous angered hard-liners with its anti-war stance. The newspaper
has called for a diplomatic solution rather than military strikes
in the conflict with the Taliban in Afghanistan.
	   Anti-Taliban feelings have run high in Iran since the militia
admitted killing eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist.
Demonstrators, newspapers and officials have called for revenge
against the Taliban, whose forces killed the Iranians after
capturing the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The newspaper also angered hard-liners by questioning the
authority of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual guide.
	   Moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who won more than
20 million votes in elections last year, has limited powers.
	   The paper began as the daily Jameah but was closed in July. When
it changed its name to Tous and continued publishing, authorities
again ordered it to close, then later rescinded the order.

Presidents of Zambia, Tanzania discuss Congo crisis with Museveni
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chiluba comments, Chiluba on way to Rwanda &QL; 
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ENTEBBE, Uganda (AP) _ The presidents of Zambia, Tanzania and
Uganda agreed Saturday that there must be a cease-fire in Congo and
foreign troops should withdraw, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said Saturday after the men met for several hours.
	   ``We all agreed that the way forward is the cessation of
hostilities,'' Chiluba told reporters before heading to Kigali to
meet with Rwandan officials. His Tanzanian counterpart Benjamin
Mkapa returned home.
	   ``Troops are to remain still, not to move forward, and there
should be an exchange of prisoners.''
	   He said all three were very happy that certain obstacles had
been removed from the way of those seeking peace in Congo, where
rebels launched a movement Aug. 2 to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   But Chiluba, who was appointed by the Southern African
Development Council to mediate in the Congo conflict, did not say
what the obstacles were and was short on specifics on how a
cease-fire would be implemented.
	   He was also not clear on the position of Ugandan troops in
northeastern Congo. On Wednesday, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
told parliament Ugandan troops would remain in Congo until a
regional security agreement had been worked out that would guaranty
Ugandan interests.
	   He said ``modalities were being worked out to find out how to
get on with the exercise of withdrawing the troops.''
	   Kabila accuses both Uganda and Rwanda of backing rebels who are
trying to topple him, and called in Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia to
help.
	   Uganda says its troops are in northeastern Congo under an
agreement with Kabila earlier in the year to permit Uganda to flush
out Ugandan rebels who have been attacking western Uganda.
	   But Museveni denies Ugandan forces are aiding the Congolese
rebels.
	   Rwanda also denies its troops are participating directly in the
conflict, but it has also reserved the right to intervene to
protect its national interests.
	   Rwandan Hutu rebels, remnants of the army and militia that
carried out the 1994 genocide against minority Tutsis in Rwanda,
have been launching attacks against Rwanda from northeastern Congo.
	   A senior Rwandan official said Saturday that time was running
out for a negotiated solution and predicted Chiluba's peace efforts
would be ``futile'' unless the Zambian president met with the Congo
rebels.
	   ``I think we are at a critical point,'' Education Minister
Joseph Karemera told reporters in Johannesburg. ``It is not enough
to just keep talking.''
	   But Chiluba said he had no immediate plans to meet with rebels,
who are headquartered in the eastern Congolese city of Goma on the
Rwandan border.
	   Late Friday, the Congolese rebels said they had captured Isiro,
the largest town in northeastern Congo, 380 kilometers (235 miles)
northeast of Kisangani.
	   Ugandan troops were reported to be in the Isiro area earlier in
the month.

More than 120 still missing in Philippine ship sinking

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ With more than 120 people still
missing, maritime officials puzzled Saturday over why a Philippine
passenger ferry with 430 people aboard began tilting in a storm and
then quickly sank.
	   By late Saturday, 14 were confirmed dead, the coast guard said.
	   The Princess of the Orient had been rocked by strong waves and
winds, but should have been able to withstand much worse weather,
officials said.
	   Passengers and crew among the 294 people rescued Saturday said
the ship sank in less than an hour _ highly unusual for a vessel
with no apparent damage.
	   The local governor appealed in a radio broadcast for help in
rescuing people still floating in the chilly, storm-whipped water.
	   Carlos Go, chief executive officer of Sulpicio Lines, the owner
of the 24-year-old ship, insisted it was in seaworthy condition
despite an on board fire in 1997.
	   Sulpicio Lines also owned the Dona Paz, a ferry that collided
with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in the world's worst peacetime
shipping disaster.
	   A year later, 250 people died in the sinking of another ship
owned by the company, the Dona Marilyn.
	   Dozens of anxious relatives waited Saturday at a coast guard
pier in Manila for two rescue ships returning with survivors.
	   Pablo Sy wept as he waited to find out whether his wife and two
sons were still alive.
	   When he saw his wife and older son stepping off the first ship,
he dashed out under a restraining rope and embraced them, still
tearfully searching for his younger son.
	   Agonizing minutes later, he came off the second ship.
	   ``I'm very happy now to see my family,'' Sy said.
	   Many of the survivors who floated for hours with life preservers
in the rough seas were covered in black oil from the ship, their
eyes bloodshot.
	   Some survivors were picked up by a passing fishing boat, while
others were plucked from the water by helicopters or navy ships.
	   One crew member, Vincente Go, said the ship began leaning to the
left and would not stabilize even after the crew began pumping
ballast water, which is used to balance ships.
	   Normally, large ships pushed one direction by heavy winds or
waves naturally bob back, but Go said the Princess of the Orient
refused to do so.
	   Another crew member said the ship's cargo may have suddenly
shifted to one side in the heavy seas.
	   But maritime officials said some other, still undetermined,
factor must have been involved.
	   Tropical Storm Vicki was beating the northern Philippines with
75 kph (45 mph) winds when the ship left Manila at about 8 p.m.
(1200 GMT) Friday for Cebu, about a day's journey to the south.
	   A storm warning prohibited ships of less than 500 tons from
sailing but did not apply to the 13,734-ton ferry, coast guard
spokesman Joel Garcia said.
	   A few hours later the ship reported it was listing 25 degrees
near Fortune island off Batangas province, about 60 kilometers (40
miles) south of Manila, and then lost radio contact, the company
told naval authorities.
	   Rescue efforts were delayed for several hours because the storm
prevented rescue ships from leaving their berths, officials said.
	   The company said 338 passengers and 92 crew were aboard the
ship. No foreign names were on the ship's manifest, Garcia said.

Pop star arrested for sexually abusing minor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A pop singer was arrested after luring a
15-year-old mechanic's assistant into his car, driving him into the
desert and then undressing him, police officials said Saturday.
	   The boy told police that Ali Hemeidah, a 50-year-old singer
whose career has waned in recent years, promised the boy that he
had star potential. They drove along a desert road outside the port
of Alexandria Friday night under the pretext that they would start
singing rehearsals, police quoted the boy as saying.
	   Hemeidah had just finished undressing the boy when a police car
drove by and officers stopped to inspect the car.
	   Hemeidah has denied the charges, saying he was seized with a
dizzy spell and was lying down on the back seat to recover.
	   Hemeidah was detained on grounds of sexual assault and
performing an indecent act in public. He has yet to be charged, but
could face three years at hard labor. The boy was released.
	   Hemeidah, who was known for his long hair, had a major hit in
the 1980s with the song ``Lolaky'' or ``Were it not for you.''
	   He has stopped producing songs, but continues to perform at
weddings and occasional shows at hotels.

Iran expects to bring home five prisoners from Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian diplomat traveled Saturday to
Afghanistan to bring home five Iranians held prisoner by the
Taliban religious militia, Iranian state radio reported.
	   The Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, claims
the 50 Iranians it captured were supplying weapons to its
opponents, who are based in the north of the country.
	   Iran says most of the prisoners are truck drivers who were
transporting emergency relief goods. Iran also accuses the Taliban
of holding about 60 Iranians.
	   Tehran radio said a diplomat from the embassy in the Pakistani
capital of Islamabad would travel to Kandahar, southeast
Afghanistan, to receive the men.
	   The Taliban, who released five Iranian prisoners in a goodwill
gesture earlier this month, had promised to release another five.
	   Tensions between Iran and Afghanistan have risen sharply in
recent weeks since the Taliban admitted that its militiamen had
killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist after capturing the
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban returned seven of the nine bodies to Tehran on
Monday.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan.
	   Taliban leaders say they have rushed troops to the frontier
region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   Iran is suspected of backing Afghanistan's opposition, which
largely represents the country's minority ethnic and religious
groups, including minority Shiite Muslims. Pakistan is widely
believed to be backing the Taliban.

Turkish premier steps up fight against alleged state-mafia ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Troubled by allegations of cozy
relationships between public officials and mobsters, Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz proposed a series of new laws Saturday to fight
organized crime.
	   Since March, authorities have arrested a number of bosses and
lower-ranking members of Turkish mafias on wide-ranging charges
alleging murder plots and racketeering.
	   ``It is impossible to solve other problems of the country
without eradicating gangs with all their extensions within the
state,'' Yilmaz said.
	   Yilmaz said his government has drafted bills that would allow
amnesty for informants, make it easier to investigate and prosecute
public officials, and toughen punishment for gang members.
	   Lawmakers are expected to discuss the proposals after they
return from summer recess in October. ``I call on all parties to
support those bills,'' Yilmaz said.
	   The state-mafia ties have been a key issue since 1996, when a
car crash injured a legislator and killed a police official and a
fugitive terrorist _ all riding together in the same car.
	   A former interior minister, a deputy, a dozen policemen and an
army sergeant have since been brought to trial, revealing further
connections between the state and the underworld.
	   In August, an alleged Turkish godfather, Alaattin Cakici, was
arrested in France _ and found to be travelling with a Turkish
diplomatic passport.
	   Senkal Atasagun, chief of the Turkish Intelligence Agency, said
Saturday that about 10 intelligence officers, including one accused
of providing Cakici with the diplomatic passport, are under
investigation.

Thousands march through Paris in Techno-Parade
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people, many with painted
faces and colorful costumes, marched through the streets of Paris
on Saturday in the city's first parade devoted to techno music.
	   Modeled after Berlin's annual Love Parade, Paris' Techno-Parade
was to culminate Saturday evening with a huge dance concert to
electronic music in eastern Paris.
	   Loudspeakers on floats decorated with flying saucers, submarines
or giant multi-color flowers pounded out techno music as the parade
made its way through the city.
	   Many of the parade participants had painted their faces and
hair, and some were decked out like American style pom-pom girls.
Still others dashed in and out of the crowd on roller skates.
	   The weather was perfect, a warm, sunny autumn day. Police had
forbidden traffic in large parts of southeastern Paris to let the
parade go by.
	   This evening's event concludes 10 days of exhibitions, debates
and concerts devoted to electronic music in the French capital.
	   Socialist Jack Lang, the former Culture Minister, launched the
idea of a French version of the German Love Parade after falling in
love with the Berlin festivities.
	   ``We want to make it so that `techno' is recognized as part of
culture as a whole,'' said Paulo Fernandez, director of Coda, a
monthly magazine devoted to techno music.
	   Organizers say they expect more than 100,000 people to show up
for Saturday night's techno party.
	   To confront the problem of drug use, some organizations, have
set up places for people to take a time out and distribute drug
prevention literature.

Serb forces advance on scattered guerrillas in Kosovo's north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KICIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb and Yugoslav forces swept Kosovo
guerrillas from one of their last strongholds Saturday, and the
ethnic Albanian rebels issued a public plea for recruits.
	   The rat-tat-tat of machine-gun fire echoed in the region
northwest of Pristina, capital of Kosovo province. Behind the lines
of the Serb-Yugoslav advance, muddy roads were crisscrossed by tank
tread-marks. Sandbag barricades left by fleeing fighters of the
Kosovo Liberation Army were littered by tins of food, empty
ammunition boxes, clothing and mattresses.
	   A guerrilla statement, published Saturday in Pristina's
Albanian-language media, claimed their forces are ``successfully
resisting the latest enemy offensive.'' But it asked for
reinforcements, urging Kosovo Albanian men with military skills to
``join the fight for freedom.''
	   At least 600 people have died and more than 275,000 have fled
their homes since February, when Serbian police launched a
crackdown on the KLA, which seeks to wrest Kosovo province from
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   The mountainous area north and northwest of Pristina, Kosovo's
capital, is one of two remaining guerrilla strongholds. The other,
in the central-western region of Drenica, has also been the scene
of fighting in the last week.
	   The KLA statement Saturday accused Serbs of aiming to rid the
areas of civilians as well as guerrillas.
	   ``The enemy is not just aiming to expel the KLA, but to
ethnically cleanse Kosovo,'' said the statement.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said at least 10,000
civilians fled Kosovo's northern mountains since the offensive.
	   On Friday, Ibrahim Rugova, Kosovo's top Albanian leader, gave
his public backing to a U.S.-sponsored plan denying his people the
independence they seek but offering them peace and local autonomy.
	   The ethnic Albanian guerrillas have rejected any negotiated
settlement short of independence from Serbia. But they have been
marginalized after months of defeats.
	   The U.S.-backed Rugova also favors independence but opposes
fighting for it. U.S. officials have been saying for weeks that
Rugova, along with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, had in
principle accepted the American plan.
	   But Rugova's public endorsement of the interim formula appeared
calculated to coincide with the latest crushing defeats of his
militant rivals.
	   Rugova called the draft a ``temporary solution,'' aimed at
``normalizing the difficult and risky situation ... halting attacks
and the use of force.''
	   The plan would give ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
Kosovo, the say over local affairs but keep them part of Serbia and
within Yugoslavia. Kosovo's autonomy was revoked in 1989 by
Milosevic.
	   Fires still smoldered Saturday in haystacks and houses of the
deserted area. Two schoolhouses in the wake of the Serb advance
were gutted by fire, their roofs collapsed.
	   Residents of Kicic, on the southern perimeter of the zone of
fighting, said hundreds of civilians fleeing to nearby towns
recounted stories of at least 20 civilians dead.
	   Nearby fighting prevented reporters from visiting an area where,
Kicic residents said, several dead civilians lie.
	   Elsewhere in the province, Serb sources reported that one
policeman died overnight at the Belgrade military hospital after
being shot near Pec, Kosovo's second largest city, Friday
afternoon.

Respiratory experts honor anti-smoking EU commissioner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A top European Union official who spearheaded the
drive against tobacco advertising was honored Saturday at a
congress of respiratory experts.
	   The European Respiratory Society handed over a special award to
Padraig Flynn, the EU Social Affairs commissioner for ``his
relentless opposition to smoking'' during 10 years of negotiations
on the ban.
	   The European Union earlier this year formally approved a law
Monday to phase-out tobacco advertising, including at major
sporting and cultural events, by the year 2006.
	   More than half a million Europeans die each year from
smoking-related causes. The respiratory society estimates that
between the year 1950 and 2000 there will have been almost 20
million deaths in Europe because of tobacco.
	   Some 9,000 respiratory specialists from Europe and the United
States are attending the congress in Geneva. The spread of asthma
in industrialized nations and new therapies for lung cancer are
among the items up for discussion.

Iranian editor delays trip home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The managing director of a banned
Iranian newspaper postponed his return home to almost certain
arrest Saturday after a doctor ordered him hospitalized for a
physical checkup.
	   Mohammad Mohsen Sazgara, 43, had planned to fly home Saturday
with his family, although he has been named in an arrest warrant.
	   His liberal newspaper Tous, which has the second highest
circulation in Iran, was shut down and banned on Wednesday.
	   Two senior editors and a publishing director were arrested the
same day, and a columnist was arrested Friday, according to reports
Sazgara received from Tehran.
	   Doctors have ordered Sazgara, who had a heart attack two years
ago, to undergo some tests. He may now reschedule his flight to
Tehran for Tuesday night.
	   Sazgara had been on vacation in Malaysia and headed to New
Zealand when he learned that his paper had been closed down.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Tous was ordered
shut for publishing articles detrimental ``to the country's
national interests and security.''
	   Sazgara denied the paper was against national security. His
paper has called for diplomacy, rather than military strikes, in
Iran's disputes with neighboring Afghanistan.
	   ``We have just been moderate and nonviolent,'' he said.
	   Sazgara said he plans to go on a hunger strike until his
colleagues are freed, the paper is reopened and the authorities
abide by the press law.
	   That law calls for cases involving the news media to be handled
in open court, not the closed-door Islamic court sessions.
	   Officials of the Islamic Revolution Court refused Saturday to
say whether Sazgara would be arrested when he returns.
	   Sazgara said he will present himself to the court to ``answer
any questions they want to ask me.''

OSCE delegation criticizes Albanian government, opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in top 7 grafs, 11th graf with quotes from OSCE
delegation leader
 &UR; AP Photos TIR101-107
 &UR; By ARLINDA CAUSHOLLI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A top international delegation criticized
both the government and opposition Saturday for their part in
rioting this week that threatened to topple the elected leadership.
	   Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe blamed ex-President Sali Berisha for the unrest.
	   Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister who led the
delegation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, said the OSCE condemned violence by supporters of
ex-President Sali Berisha against the government of Prime Miniser
Fatos Nano.
	   He said the Berisha's Democratic Party ``was with its tactics
involved in the violence,'' but also criticized Nano's government
for being slow in fighting corruption.
	   ``Significant changes should be expected,'' Geremek said. He did
not elaborate but said the delegation supported efforts by
President Rexhep Meidani to resolve the conflict.
	   George Papandreou, the Greek alternate foreign minister who was
part of the OSCE delegation, warned that Berisha and his party
could be isolated by the international community if they continue
with tactics that undermine democratic institutions in Albania.
	   The delegation met separately with Berisha, Nano and Meidani
after arriving Saturday morning on a mission to resolve the crisis
that put Albania on the brink of anarchy for the second time in 18
months.
	   Berisha's followers have demanded the resignation of Nano since
last weekend's assassination of popular opposition figure and
Berisha ally Azem Hajdari.
	   As Berisha met with the OSCE delegation, about 3,000 of his
supporters rallied in central Skanderbeg Square for their fifth
straight peaceful demonstration.
	   Hajdari's death set off the rioting Sunday and Monday, in which
mobs briefly seized government buildings, state television and
Nano's office.
	   Geremek condemned Hajdari's killing Saturday and said the
delegation hoped for answers soon on who was responsible. Berisha
accused Nano of ordering the killing to try to destroy the
opposition, while Western officials say they believe the shooting
death resulted from a personal feud.
	   On Friday, the Albanian parliament voted overwhelmingly to lift
Berisha's immunity from prosecution, clearing the way for his
arrest and prosecution for allegedly trying to overthrow the
government.
	   Berisha responded he would continue to oppose Nano's government
``from whatever cell they put me in.''
	   Western powers want a ``cooling off period'' before any attempt
to arrest Berisha, fearing his detention would make him a martyr to
his supporters and further inflame tensions.
	   ``We think the opposition should be in Parliament,'' Geremek
said when asked about Berisha's possible arrest. ``We repeat, the
opposition should not be in prison and not in street
demonstrations.''
	   He was alluding to the Democratic party's boycott of parliament
since July.
	   Instability in Albania is feared abroad because of its potential
to stoke unrest in other other parts of the volatile Balkans.
Berisha has publicly supported Albanian rebels seeking independence
in neighboring Kosovo, a province of Serbia the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   Chief prosecutor Arben Rakipi said in a newspaper interview
published Saturday that lifting Berisha's immunity was necessary to
allow the investigation of the rioting to proceed. He told the Koha
Jone independent daily newspaper he expected to question Berisha
early next week, but left open the possibility of a formal arrest.

Indian shelling kills nine, wounds 11 in Pakistani-controlled
</HEADLINE>
Kashmir &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Indian artillery fire has killed nine
people and wounded 11 others in Pakistani-controlled parts of the
disputed Kashmir province over the past two days, Pakistan's
military said Saturday.
	   Artillery duels across the Kashmir dividing line, which is
monitored by the United Nations, routinely break out between the
hostile neighbors. The last major exchange was in late July and
early August, when shelling killed more than 100 civilians on both
sides of the border.
	   A military statement said Indian troops shelled civilian areas
in the Kel and Kargil areas. Kel is 80 kilometers (50 miles) and
Kargil is 150 kilometers (90 miles) from Muzaffarabad, the capital
of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir.
	   Pakistan troops returned fire and reported hitting Indian
bunkers and military posts in retaliation for what the statement
called an unprovoked attack.
	   The statement said a large number of villagers fled their homes
due to the shelling and were being housed in makeshift camps.
	   Since their independence from Britain in 1947, Pakistan and
India have fought two wars over Kashmir, a remote Himalayan
territory divided between them. Kashmir is the only
Muslim-dominated region in largely Hindu India, and Pakistan, an
Islamic republic, wants the right to self determination for the
entire divided province.

Lions beat Marines 10-3, takes Pacific League lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Domingo Martinez drove in six runs on two homers
Saturday as the Seibu Lions overwhelmed the Chiba Lotte Marines
10-3 at Chiba, rising to the Pacific League's first place.
	   Martinez, formerly of the Triple-A Rochester, arched a two-run
shot in the top of the sixth inning before hitting a grand slam in
the ninth.
	   Martinez now has 27 homers.
	   At Tokyo Dome, Tadahito Iguchi belted a three-run homer in the
top of the fourth inning, giving the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks a 3-1
victory over the Nippon Ham Fighters.
	   The Fighters slipped to second place in the league.
	   At Osaka Dome, Norihiro Nakamura and Tetsuya Matoyama connected
for home runs in a five-run sixth inning, giving the Kintetsu
Buffaloes a 7-0 shutout victory over the Orix BlueWave.
	   Motoyuki Akahori (3-2) went the distance, throwing a
three-hitter, while striking out one and walking two, for his first
complete shutout game in six years.
	   In the Central League, Robert Rose hit a two-run homer in the
top of the first inning, giving the front-running Yokohama BayStars
an early start toward their 4-2 victory over the Yakult Swallows at
Jingu stadium.
	   Rose, formerly of the California Angels, drove in another run on
a single in the sixth. He has 17 homers this season.
	   The BayStars' losing streak ended at three.
	   Kazuhiro Sasaki gave up one hit, struck out one and walked one
in the last two innings, collecting his 39th save, a Japanese
professional baseball record.
	   Sasaki tied with Sun Dong-yol of the Chunichi Dragons last
season for the previous Japanese record of 38 saves.
	   At Nagoya Dome, Takeshi Yamasaki batted in a tie-breaking run on
his two-out single in the bottom of the eighth as the Dragons edged
the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 3-2.
	   Korean pitching star Sun chalked up his 28th save, although he
gave up a solo homer to Tomoaki Kanemoto.
	   At Koshien, the Yomiuri Giants pounced out 13 hits as they
trounced the Hanshin Tigers 9-1.
	   Hideki Matsui hit a solo homer in the top of the sixth, his 32nd
for the season. Matsui leads in home runs this season in both
leagues.

Australians win two diving golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Vyninka Arlow came from behind
with the highest women's score of the night on her last dive
Saturday night as Australia won two diving gold medals at the
Commonwealth Games.
	   In the women's platform event, Canadian silver medalist Myriam
Boileau's protest that a loud horn in the crowd spoiled her last
dive was dismissed.
	   Roy Shannon beat fellow Australian Dean Pullar for gold on the
men's 3-meter springboard.
	   Boileau led by less than half a point after four of the five
women's final-round dives. Her final dive added only 57.960 to her
score, while Arlow earned good marks for a difficult 3 1/2
somersault with pike and gained 65.700.
	   Arlow finished with 456.480 to Boileau's 449.190. Canada's Anne
Montminy took the bronze with 443.460.
	   Arlow's mother, Robyn, won a silver medal at the 1966 games in
the same event.
	   ``It's good to get past mum,'' said Arlow, who has gone through
knee and shoulder operations and a back injury in the past two
years.
	   ``The injuries made it very frustrating because I wasn't able to
train properly but that just made it more important to have a lot
of mental strength,'' she said.
	   Pullar led after three of the men's six final dives, but Shannon
came up with his best scores on the next three dives and won with
608.370 points to Pullar's 598.140.
	   England's Antonio Ali won the bronze with 587.490.

Iranian newspaper columnist arrested
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Malaysia-Iranian Journalist &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A political columnist for Tous, a banned
Iranian newspaper, was arrested Saturday, colleagues said, in the
third detention involving the liberal daily this week.
	   Tous angered hard-liners by calling for a diplomatic solution,
rather than military strikes, to resolve the conflict with the
Taliban religious militia in neighboring Afghanistan.
	   Seyed Ebrahim Nabavi went to court Saturday after receiving a
summons and was arrested, said colleagues, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. The paper's managing director, Mohammad Mohsen
Sazgara, had said earlier that Nabavi was picked up Friday.
	   Tous, a liberal newspaper with the second-highest circulation in
Iran, was shut down Wednesday for publishing articles detrimental
``to the country's national interests and security.'
	   Editor Mahmoud Shams and Hamid Reza Jalaipur, director of its
publishing company, were also arrested Wednesday.
	   In addition to its antiwar stance, the newspaper angered
hard-liners by questioning the ultimate authority of Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, Iran's spiritual guide. Moderate Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami, who won more than 20 million votes in elections
last year, has limited powers.
	   Anti-Taliban feelings have run high in Iran since the militia
admitted killing eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist.
Demonstrators, newspapers and officials have called for revenge
against the Taliban, whose forces killed the Iranians after
capturing the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The paper began as the daily Jameah but was closed in July. When
it changed its name to Tous and continued publishing, authorities
again ordered it to close, then later rescinded the order.

Shooting in Monrovia as troops surround ex-rebel leader's home
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to add peacekeepers falling back to city's edge,
reports of casualties in hospitals and clinics. ADDS byline. No
pickup.
 &UR; JONATHAN PAYE-LAYLEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Machine-gun fire rattled through
downtown Monrovia on Saturday, after government troops surrounded
the home of former warlord Roosevelt Johnson and called for the
arrest of armed dissidents.
	   There were unconfirmed reports of civilian casualties pouring
into several clinics and witnesses said some shops and offices had
been looted. Streets were nearly deserted as frightened residents
barred the doors to their homes.
	   West African peacekeepers based in the capital fell back to the
outskirts of the city after President Charles Taylor's soldiers
encircled Johnson's residence overnight near the city center.
	   There was no explanation for the withdrawal, although a
government official who asked to remain anonymous said the
Nigerian-led peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG had agreed not to
intervene in what amounted to a government operation to round up
opponents.
	   In a radio broadcast, Information Minister Joe Mulba called on
residents to report ``dissident'' forces to authorities so they
could be arrested.
	   Nurses and doctors were called on to treat an unknown number of
wounded, including women and children, officials said on condition
of anonymity.
	   Taylor's personal military security unit has been involved in
clashes on several occasions in recent months with Johnson's
supporters, who have accused the president of trying to kidnap and
assassinate their leader.
	   Johnson on Friday told journalists that members of his former
Ulimo-J rebel group were disgruntled by Taylor's refusal to allow
ECOMOG direct the formation of a new national military and police
force. Instead, Taylor had handpicked members of his own former
rebel group.
	   The government has repeatedly called for the eviction of
Johnson's supporters from homes they allegedly illegally occupy
nearby their leader's spacious apartment, which is usually guarded
by ECOMOG troops.
	   Many Liberians have vivid memories of the country's seven-year
civil war that left 150,000 people dead and prompted countless
thousands more to flee their homes.
	   Johnson is a former arch-foe of Taylor, but the two were among a
number of warlords who signed a fragile truce in 1996. Johnson
returned from exile to become Liberia's rural development minister
after Taylor won last July's presidential elections.
	   Earlier this year, Johnson ignored an offer from Taylor to
become Liberia's first ambassador to India.

United States likely to send 300,000 tons of foodstuff to Dhaka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ The United States is likely to send an
additional 300,000 tons of food stocks to flood-ravaged Bangladesh
to top the 400,000 tons committed earlier, a visiting U.S. official
said Saturday.
	   A Bangladeshi request for more emergency supplies of foodstuff
was being considered by the U.S. government and a formal
announcement would be made in a week, Thomas H Fox, Assistant
Administrator of the United States Agency for International
Development told reporters.
	   Fox said the U.S. had already pledged aid worth dlrs 71.4
million as part of the relief effort to help the estimated 35
million affected in over two months of flooding in Bangladesh.
Apart from food stocks, this includes grants for the American
charitable agency CARE and Dhaka's International Center for
Diarrheal Diseases and Rehabilitation.
	   United Nations experts had warned last week that millions across
the country would become vulnerable to life-threatening diseases if
timely action was not taken by government and international donors
against a possible flareup of waterborne diseases.

Peris-Kneebone gets gold; South Africa wins cricket
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES throughout. EDITS &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia lost at its national
game but gained a new national heroine Saturday as hockey player
turned sprinter Nova Peris-Kneebone capped a remarkable
transformation with the Commonwealth Games 200-meter title.
	   While Australia's cricket team missed out on a gold it was
favored to win, Peris-Kneebone gave the medal standings leader its
most unexpected victory.
	   Only competing because world 400-meter champion Cathy Freeman
was sidelined, Peris-Kneebone lunged to a .02 second win over
Jamaica's Juliet Campbell.
	   Two years ago in Atlanta, Peris-Kneebone became the first
Australian Aboriginal to win an Olympic gold as the women's field
hockey team triumphed. She quit hockey to try out for the track
team, but her performances this season were not good enough to win
her a place in the 100- or 200-meter events. Freeman, Australia's
first Aboriginal world track champion, pulled out of the games
because of a foot injury and Melinda Gainsford-Taylor's knee injury
allowed Peris-Kneebone to contest the sprint double.
	   ``I had no idea. I wanted to see it up on the scoreboard,''
Peris-Kneebone said after the tight finish. ``I knew it was
extremely close. It's like when I won my hockey gold medal, I just
couldn't believe it until later on.''
	   Peris-Kneebone is a popular figure whose star will now rise even
higher. She was named Young Australian of the Year in 1997 and
recently was given the honor of being the first Australian to carry
the Olympic torch when it arrives ahead of the 2000 Sydney
Olympics.
	   Peris-Kneebone's medal helped Australia to another unexpected
position, atop the track and field gold standings with nine to
England's seven. Late on Day 9, Australia had 69 overall, to
England's 24 and Canada's 20.
	   Kenya's runners had a typically standout night at the track. Led
by former world record holder Daniel Komen, Kenya had a sweep of
the 5,000 meters medals and Kennedy Ngetich ran a lap of honor with
his gold medal-winning teammate Japhet Kimutai despite placing last
in the 800 meters after an extraordinary pacemaking triumph.
	   Ngetich stretched the field and ran the speed out of South
Africa's Olympic silver medalist Hezekiel Sepeng.
	   Former world champion Maria Mutola led virtually all the way in
a Mozambique 1-2 finish in the women's 800 meters. Countrywoman
Argentina Paulino took the silver in 1:58.39. England's Diana
Modahl, the 1990 titlist returning to the Games after a positive
drug test _ later ruled invalid _ was third in 1:58.81.
	   ``I'm really happy. I'm relieved,'' said bronze medalist Modahl,
who has campaigned for four years that she was innocent and is
suing the British Athletics Federation for damages.
	   ``I feel that this chapter is over. The fight is not over but
it's certainly an ending to the last four years.''
	   Earlier Saturday, South African captain Shaun Pollock lifted his
young team to the first ever Commonwealth Games cricket gold medal
as it destroyed a full-strength Australia by four wickets in the
final.
	   Only Steve Waugh, with an unbeaten 90, stood firm against
Pollock's bowling as he claimed 4-19 in Australia's 183 all out.
South Africa reached 184-6.
	   ``I'm chuffed. We've won the gold and I think the guys have
deserved a good party tonight,'' Pollock said.
	   Australian Darryn Hill and Canada's Tanya Dubnicoff claimed the
men's and women's track cycling sprint events, both winning their
best of three finals 2-0.
	   Hill, the former world champion, was too strong for compatriot
Sean Eadie, while defending champion Dubnicoff continued her strong
form by beating world championship silver medalist Michelle Ferris
of Australia.
	   Malaysia and Australia lined up places in the men's field hockey
gold playoff in a dramatic night of semifinals. Australia came from
1-0 and then 2-1 down to win 3-2 with an extra time golden goal
from Michael Brennan. In the second semi, hot favorite India
pressed all match, had eight corners to two, but lost to a golden
goal from Mirnawan Nawawi.
	   Australia's Olympic champion women's hockey team advanced to the
final against England. Australia thrashed New Zealand 7-3 and
England beat India 2-0.
	   The shooting competition was overshadowed by news that a
Pakistani competitor had been summoned to the Commonwealth Games
doping control center Saturday for a second drugs test.
	   Bernama news agency, quoting a source it did not name, said the
shooter was asked to come to Kuala Lumpur immediately from Langkawi
Island, site of the games' shooting competition.
	   Australian Annemarie Forder won the women's air pistol final
with a games record of 480.6 points while compatriot Susan McCready
won the women's sport rifle final from Sharon Bowes of Canada and
Malaysia's Roslina Bakar.
	   India's Jaspal Rana beat South African Allan McDonald in a
shootout in the men's center-fire pistol final to take the gold.
	   Canadian weightlifter Akos Sandor, 21, took triple gold in the
men's 105-kilogram division. His 167.5-kg snatch eclipsed the old
Commonwealth Games mark by 7.5 kg, and his total of 360 beat the
previous record by 2.5. New Zealand's Darren Liddel doubled his
country's gold tally with a clean sweep in the over-105 kg
category.
	   Australian diver Vyninka Arlow survived an official protest from
Canadian Myriam Boileau to take the women's 10-meter platform
diving gold. Arlow nailed her final dive, a 3-1/2 somersault with
pike. Boileau messed up her last attempt and officials rejected her
protest that she was distracted by a loud horn set off in the
crowd.
	   Australia completed a double win at the diving when Shannon Roy
won the men's 3-meter springboard.

Russian defense minister vows debts to military will be paid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said
Saturday that the government would pay 4.1 billion rubles (dlrs
273.3 million) in salaries it owes to military personnel by the end
of the month, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The sum represents the unpaid salaries for June and July, while
the entire debt to servicemen, including social support, stands at
16 billion (dlrs 1.06 billion), Interfax said.
	   Sergeyev said he had secured the pledge on Thursday during his
meeting with President Boris Yeltsin. He said that part of the debt
would be paid in food.
	   Sergeyev asserted that in spite of the nation's economic
turmoil, Russia's armed forces still had 90 percent of their
normal, emergency food reserves.
	   Sergeyev also said that he'd submitted a proposal on Friday to
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov to allow the armed
forces to earn money.
	   ``We just need to be given the right to do this following the
experience of the Chinese armed forces in a difficult time,''
Interfax quoted Sergeyev as saying, without elaborating.
	   Sergeyev expressed his full support for newly confirmed Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, saying he ``well understands the army's
problems and always supported the armed forces, even while he was
foreign minister,'' Interfax reported.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with Malaysia-India semis, women's
semifinals &QL; 
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia stunned India 1-0 and
Australia scraped past England 3-2 as the Commonwealth Games men's
field hockey semifinals were both decided by golden goals Saturday.
	   Playing before a 20,000-strong home crowd, Malaysia's captain
Mirnawan Nawazi deflected the ball into the Indian goal off a
penalty corner in extra time. Both teams failed to score during a
regulation time clearly dominated by the Indian team.
	   In the women's section, Australia and England moved to the
finals. Olympic champion Australia thrashed New Zealand 7-3 and
England scored a goal in each half to beat favored India 2-0.
	   In the first men's semifinal, Michael Brennan breezed past
English defenders to score an extra time golden goal and push
Australia into the finals.
	   Locked 2-2 at the final whistle after a match that was
fast-paced but full of missed opportunities for both sides, Brennan
snatched the ball away during an English charge and zigzagged his
way past two dazed defenders for the winning goal. The goal came in
the second minute of extra time.
	   After a drab and barren first half, England came back from the
breather more energetic and began assaulting Australia immediately.
They struck in the 56th minute when Jon Wyatt deflected the ball
from Russell Garcia in a penalty corner.
	   But Australia retaliated within two minutes with Matthew Smith
equalizing with a field goal.
	   With minutes to go for the final whistle, the aggressive English
side was back in front with Garcia scooping a penalty corner shot
past the flailing arms of Australian goalkeeper Damon Diletti.
	   Australia equalized with Jeremy Hiskins exploiting a defensive
lapse to tap the ball into the English goal in the 72nd minute.
	   Many of the English players were in tears at the end, and
Australian coach terry Walsh admitted fortune had favored his team.
	   ``The most important outcome was the character of the team that
came through, and it was right across the board, it wasn't any one
individual,'' Walsh said. ``It was a difficult match and we were
out of it on a couple of occasions and the character of the guys to
come back was really good.''
	   For India, the 1975 world champion, it was an evening of missed
chances. Despite dominating play and securing eight penalty corners
against Malaysia's three, the once-famed team from the subcontinent
failed to convert.
	   India came close to scoring when captain Dhanraj Pillay, finding
himself with just goalkeeper Roslan Jamaluddin to contend with,
misdirected the shot by just a fraction and the ball rolled past
the goalpost.
	   In the run up to the semis, Australia, which romped into the
semis topping Group A, has won four of its five matches, a shock
2-3 defeat by South Africa the only blemish in its campaign.
	   England, coached by former Australian star Barry Dancer, reached
the semifinal finishing second best to Malaysia in its pool. The
team may have had a better chance with the presence of penalty
corner specialist Calum Giles, who has been left out of the side
following the new rules prohibiting substitution during set-pieces.
	   Australia have beaten England twice this year _ 4-2 in the Azlan
Shah Tournament at Ipoh, Malaysia, and 3-0 at Utrecht, where
England was placed sixth, two places behind Australia. (rr-tjh)

kilometers (158,000 square miles) bounded by Norway, Finland and
the Baltic Sea.
	   ___

of the European Union, but opted out of the first round of the EU's
single-currency program.
	   A century ago, Sweden had one of Europe's most economically
divided societies, but in the 20th century developed its ``middle
way'' mix of capitalism and socialism that smoothed over class
lines by creation of a cradle-to-grave social welfare system.
	   ___
	   INDUSTRY: Well-industrialized but with a small domestic market,
Sweden is a major exporter of telecommunications equipment,
automobiles, forest products and precision machinery.
	   ___
	   ECONOMY: After a slump in the early 1990s as the costs of the
welfare state grew, Sweden has reduced unemployment from double
digits to around 7 percent. Inflation is negligible and the
government predicts a small budget surplus this year. The tax
burden, about 53 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, is the
world's highest.
	   ___
	   ELECTION: Voting is for the parliament seats and municipal and
county elections. Seven parties are expected to win parliament
seats, ranging from the ex-communist Left Party to the conservative
Christian Democrats. The Social Democrats, who have governed for
most of this century, are expected retain power, most likely as a
minority government with support from the Left.
	   The election campaign focused on reducing unemployment and
restoring social services.

Israel's press anti-Arab, Egyptian newspaper says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Israeli media and literature are replete
with racist comments about Arabs, a leading Egyptian columnist
wrote Saturday, days after Egypt's media was criticized as
anti-Semitic.
	   The front-page column by editor Ibrahim Nafei in Al-Ahram
newspaper said Egyptian newspapers were staunchly pro-Palestinian,
not anti-Semitic, and that Israeli publications should look inward
at their own biases and misconceptions.
	   ``Israeli education and religious books are full of phrases that
accuse Arabs of being a breed of humans that are cheats, deceitful,
and filthy,'' said Nafei, whose column reflects government
thinking.
	   The column follows the release of an 11-page document by the
Israeli Government Press Office on what it called pervasive
anti-Semitism in Egypt's media.
	   The document said anti-Semitic stereotypes, comparisons of
Israel with Nazi Germany and the denial of the Holocaust were
recurring themes in the official Egyptian press.
	   But Nafei said Israeli attacks against Egypt's press would not
``reign in its tongue or scare it.''
	   Nafei said that Egypt was being singled out by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for its support of the Palestinians and
as a scapegoat for the damage he himself has caused the Mideast
peace process, which has stalemated since last year.
	   Egypt became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979, and has long acted as a mediator between Israel and
Arabs. But ties between the two countries have remained cold.

Malaysia upsets Canada for rhythmic gymnastics gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Thye Chee Kiat's high scoring led
Malaysia to an upset victory over defending champion Canada
Saturday in the rhythmic gymnastics team competition at the
Commonwealth Games.
	   Thye helped the Malaysians edge ahead 93.023 to 92.962 at the
end with a 9.500 in her last routine, with the clubs. Australia won
the bronze with 92.937.
	   Canada's Erika-Leigh Stirton had the only marks higher than
Thye's with a 9.600 for the clubs and 9.500's for the hoop and
ribbon. She had 9.450 for the rope.
	   Thye had a 9.475 for each the rope and hoop, and 9.200 for the
ribbon, helping a powerful advance by a team that had finished last
at the 1994 games.
	   ``I was in no pressure even though I know there is. While
attempting my last routine, I tried not to think about it but just
do the best,'' she said.

Afrikaners protest proposed broadcasting law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Thousands of listeners of an
Afrikaans-language radio station demonstrated Saturday against a
proposed law that would require multicultural radio programming.
	   ``You won't kill our voice,'' said a poster carried by one of
the 3,000 listeners of Radio Pretoria who converged on government
buildings in Pretoria, the capital. Another poster had an
undercurrent of threat, reading: ``You silence us and we will
silence you.''
	   The proposed Broadcasting Bill would order community stations to
cater to all people living in an area and not to specific language,
ethnic or religious groups.
	   The protesters, many of whom wore khaki and military uniforms
and carried apartheid-era flags, said the bill threatens the
culture of Afrikaners, the descendants of Dutch settlers.
	   Radio Pretoria executive Dominee Mossie van der Berg said all
possible legal steps would be taken to prevent the station from
being forced to serve an audience other than Afrikaners.
	   Apartheid ended in 1994 with South Africa's first-ever all-race
elections, but many of the country's institutions are still
undergoing transformation to reflect its multicultural and
multiracial makeup.

Hurricane watches posted in eastern Caribbean as Georges nears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new speed and location of storm; UPDATES with
hurricane watches extended to Virgin Islands. As of 11 a.m. AST
(1500 GMT), hurricane located 15.0 north latitude and 52.8 west
longitude, about 540 miles (875 kilometers) east of the Lesser
Antilles. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Residents of small islands in
the eastern Caribbean stocked up on food and water as Hurricane
Georges grew stronger and moved closer Saturday.
	   Hurricane watches, already posted from St. Lucia to Anguilla,
were extended at 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT) to the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands.
	   People were calm, but they also were taking the strengthening
storm seriously.
	   ``I just pulled up two of my boats out of the water,'' said
David Armour, a resident on Dominica, the mountainous island that
lies directly in Georges' path. ``The gas stations are full. People
are filling their tanks.''
	   The National Hurricane Center in Miami said at 11 a.m. EDT (1500
GMT) Saturday that Georges was centered at 15.0 north latitude and
52.8 west longitude, about 540 miles east of the Lesser Antilles.
Its winds had strengthened to 125 mph (205 kph) with stronger gusts
and was expected to begin affecting the islands Sunday.
	   Georges was moving almost due west at 18 mph (29 kph), slightly
slower than its progress Friday.
	   A reconnaisance plane is expected to fly into the hurricane
Saturday afternoon to confirm the estimations of its strength made
by the Hurricane Center based on satellite images.
	   Hurricane watches were posted Friday in St. Lucia, Dominica,
Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saba, Antigua, St. Maarten, Anguilla and
other islands as disaster preparedness teams met to plan for
Georges, the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic season. The Hurricane
Center said the watches could be upgraded to warnings later
Saturday.
	   Georges grew not only stronger, but also bigger overnight. The
Hurricane Center said the storm now has hurricane force winds
extending 45 miles (70 kilometers) from the center, and tropical
storm force winds extended outward up to 200 miles (320
kilometers).

Spain leads Swiss 1-0, after Sanchez-Vicario beats Schnyder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ Spain took a 1-0 lead over host
Switzerland in the Fed Cup final Saturday when world No. 4 Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario defeated Patty Schnyder.
	   The 10,000 flag-waving spectators packing the Palexpo watched in
dismay as Sanchez-Vicario defeated Schnyder 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 in a
roller-coaster match which lasted 2 hours, 25 minutes.
	   ``It was important to win the first point for Spain,'' said
Sanchez-Vicario. ``The second match will be up to Conchita. All I
can do now is try to get points for my country in my next
matches.''
	   Supported by Spain's own little contingent of fans, clacking
castagnets and tambourines, Sanchez-Vicario dominated the first
set, with Schynder often aiding the Spaniard's campaign herself.
	   Making one unforced error after another, Schnyder gave up her
second and third serves in the opening set.
	   The Swiss teenager first double-faulted at 30-40 to give
Sanchez-Vicario a 3-1 advantage, then let the Spaniard make the
most of two break points to go ahead 4-1.
	   It was only when she was broken on her opening serve in the
second set that Schnyder suddenly came to life, finally displaying
the form which led her to five tournament wins this season, and
which lifted her from 26th to ninth in the WTA Tour rankings.
	   Spurred on by the crowd, Schnyder immediately broke back, then
held to even the score 2-2.
	   At 4-3, Schnyder once again broke Sanchez-Vicario's serve, then
held to even the sets.
	   On a roll, the 19-year-old Swiss broke Sanchez-Vicario's opening
serve in the final set, sending the crowd into a frenzy.
	   But drawing on the experience and determination which have
helped her lead Spain to four Fed Cup titles, Sanchez-Vicario broke
back to go up 4-2.
	   Schnyder had the opportunity to break back in the next game, but
squandered three break points, allowing Sanchez-Vicario to jump
ahead 5-2.
	   Sanchez-Vicario then broke her opponent's final serve to give
Spain the lead.
	   ``I dominated in the first set,'' said the 26-year-old
Sanchez-Vicario. ``She came back hard in the second, attacking
more.
	   ``But down 2-0 in the last set, I concentrated more, attacked
more and that's what won me the match.''
	   For Schnyder, the loss was devastating.
	   ``Each exchange was so long,'' said Schnyder, close to tears.
``I tried everything I could. In the second set I was able to
comeback but I was tired out in the last set.''

Israel's press anti-Arab, Egyptian newspaper says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 6th graf to fix typo in `rein' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Israeli media and literature are replete
with racist comments about Arabs, a leading Egyptian columnist
wrote Saturday, days after Egypt's media was criticized as
anti-Semitic.
	   The front-page column by editor Ibrahim Nafei in Al-Ahram
newspaper said Egyptian newspapers were staunchly pro-Palestinian,
not anti-Semitic, and that Israeli publications should look inward
at their own biases and misconceptions.
	   ``Israeli education and religious books are full of phrases that
accuse Arabs of being a breed of humans that are cheats, deceitful,
and filthy,'' said Nafei, whose column reflects government
thinking.
	   The column follows the release of an 11-page document by the
Israeli Government Press Office on what it called pervasive
anti-Semitism in Egypt's media.
	   The document said anti-Semitic stereotypes, comparisons of
Israel with Nazi Germany and the denial of the Holocaust were
recurring themes in the official Egyptian press.
	   But Nafei said Israeli attacks against Egypt's press would not
``rein in its tongue or scare it.''
	    &UR; Nafei said, 7th graf

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nigerian Mary Onyali was the only double gold
medalist Saturday as she swept the 100- and 200-meter races in the
one-day, 11th annual TOTO International Super Track and Field at
Tokyo National Stadium.
	   Onyali took the 200 meters in 22.87 seconds, edging Ukrainian
world champion Zhanna Pintusevich at 23.05, before winning the 100
meters in 11.11 seconds ahead of American Inger Miller, who clocked
11.16.
	   ``We didn't really care much about the time,'' said Onyali.
``This is the end of the season and everyone is tired.''
	   In the women's 400-meter hurdles, Atlanta Olympic gold medalist
Deon Hemmings of Jamaica led right from the start and held on to
win in 54.96, 1.08 seconds ahead of second-placed Ionela Tirlea of
Romania.
	   ``The race was OK but it was a little windy,'' said Hemmings.
``This is my last meet for the season. So I wanted to finish at a
good note for the next season.''
	   Michelle Freeman, also from Jamaica, won the women's 100-meter
hurdles in 12.75 seconds. Anjanette Kirkland placed second in 13.25
and her American compatriot Melissa Morrison finished third in
13.27.
	   In the men's competition, world 200-meter champion Ato Boldon of
Trinidad won the 100 meters in 10.07 seconds, edging world champion
Maurice Greene of the United States by 0.15 second.
	   Nigeria's Seun Ogunkoya clocked 10.23 into a head wind to place
third.
	   Boldon had rushed to Tokyo after his gold medal run at the
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``You never know how you are coming in a championship race,''
said Bolden. ``I raced very well today into the face wind.''
	   World record holder Colin Jackson of Britain won the 110-meter
hurdles in 13.51 seconds, edging Olympic champion Allen Johnson of
the United States, who clocked 13.58.
	   In the 200 meters, Nigerian Francis Obikwelu beat Japanese
national record holder Koji Ito in 20.49 seconds. Ito was just 0.12
second behind.
	   In the men's 400 meters, Jerome Young edged his fellow American
Antonio Pettigrew in a photo finish in the same time of 45.06
seconds.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Kenji Oshiba kicked a well-timed pass from Masahiro
Fukuda into the goal Saturday, as the Urawa Reds shutout the
Yokohama Flugels 3-0, keeping their lead in the 18-team Japanese
professional soccer league.
	   The Reds, who placed seventh in the first stage, leads the
second stage with a 6-0 record and 18 points.
	   Playing before 19,740 spectators at home, Oshiba scored the
first goal in the 24th minute with Fukuda's assist.
	   Fukuda and Dutchman Tarik Oulida added a goal each in the second
half.
	   At Mizuho, Takashi Hirano scored a goal in the 44th minute as
the second-place Nagoya Grampus Eight beat bottom club JEF United
Ichihara 3-0.
	   At Mitsusawa, Brazilian midfielder Pintado scored a tie-breaking
goal in the 82nd minute, lifting Cerezo Osaka to a 3-2 victory over
Yokohama Marinos.
	   Marinos now stand four points behind the Reds and another behind
Nagoya.
	   Forward Yoshiteru Yamashita scored an extra-time goal as Avispa
Fukuoka edged Kashiwa Reysol, whose five-game winning streak
stopped.
	   Reysol, whose five-game winning streak ended Saturday, dropped
to fourth place with 13 points.
	   First-stage winner Jubilo Iwata secured its fourth straight
victory at home. Toshiya Fujita struck a 64-minute goal to beat
Verdy Kawasaki 1-0 at Iwata.
	   At rain-soaked Expo Stadium, Sanfrecce Hiroshima beat Gamba
Osaka 2-0. Tetsuya Ito and Tatsuhiko Kubo delivered a late goal
each.
	   At Hiratsuka, Ricardinho scored a goal in the first half as the
Bellmare Hiratsuka beat winless Vissel Kobe 1-0.
	   In other matches, Yoshiyuki Hasegawa's double strike gave
Kashima Antlers a 3-2 victory over Consadole Sapporo. Shimizu
S-Pulse edged visiting Kyoto Purple Sanga 3-2.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An American mediator on Saturday was wrapping
up his latest effort _ fruitless so far _ to end the 18-month
deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts.
	   And as so often happens in Israel, tension and fear shadowed
what was supposed to be a festive occasion _ the Jewish New Year's
holiday, beginning at sundown Sunday.
	   In the West Bank _ whose border with Israel was sealed off,
along with that of the Gaza Strip _ thousands of supporters of the
radical Islamic group Hamas staged a march, burning U.S. and
Israeli flags and screaming, ``Revenge, revenge!''
	   Barring a last-minute breakthrough in separate talks later
Saturday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. envoy Dennis Ross appeared poised
to head back to the United States empty-handed after an 11-day
visit to the region.
	   In the American-brokered talks, the two sides have been trying
to reach agreement on a long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and on revised terms of a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Ross' departure was scheduled early Sunday, only hours before
the start of the two-day Rosh Hashana holiday. Commentators agreed
that as the year wound down, things looked inauspicious indeed on
the peace front.
	   ``If it's time for New Year well-wishing, let there be some
realism,'' commentator B. Michael wrote in Friday's editions of the
Yediot Ahronot daily newspaper. ``The chance that the next year
will be a good one is pretty slim.''
	   Israelis mark Rosh Hashana with special prayers and readings,
and the blowing of a ram's horn, or shofar. A traditional treat is
apple slices dipped in honey, symbolizing hopes that the coming
year will be sweet.
	   But bitterness was the overriding theme. The Palestinian
Cabinet, in a statement issued Saturday, blamed Israel for the
failure to reach an accord during Ross' visit.
	   ``The mission did not achieve the progress anticipated due to
Israeli procrastination in ... acceptance of the American
Initiative,'' said the Cabinet, which met late Friday.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, more than 3,000 supporters of
the radical Islamic group Hamas rallied Saturday, waving green
Hamas flags and singing nationalistic songs. Palestinian police did
not interfere with the march, staged in a Palestinian-controlled
area.
	   ``The blood of our murdered ones will not be wasted!'' said
Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin, addressing the demonstrators
by telephone hookup from Gaza.
	   Hamas has vowed to avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers Imad
and Adel Awadallah, top fugitives who were shot dead by Israeli
troops in a bloody raid on their West Bank hideout.
	   Near the West Bank town of Ramallah, Israeli troops and
Palestinian demonstrators fought small-scale skirmishes over
several hours on Saturday. About 20 youths on a highway overpass
outside Ramallah tore down protective fencing meant to keep them
from stoning motorists.
	   ``Allahu akbar _ God is great!'' they shouted as they flung
chunks of stone that slammed into a passing army jeep. Soldiers
jumped out, guns at the ready, and fired tear gas to disperse the
youths. No injuries were reported.
	   Later, near an Israeli checkpoint south of Ramallah,
Palestinians threw stones at soldiers and burned tires, sending
plumes of black smoke into the air. The official Voice of Palestine
radio said Israeli troops encircled the area.
	   Arafat, meanwhile, accused the Israeli government of condoning
violence by Jewish settlers against Palestinians, and said such
attacks were destroying prospects for peace. A Palestinian youth
was shot dead Thursday by a Jewish settler near the West Bank
village of Beitunia.
	   The settler said he acted in self-defense after his car was
stoned; Palestinians said the shooting was unprovoked. A magistrate
ordered the settler held over until at least Sunday.
	   ``These crimes happen, and we haven't heard any denunciation of
such acts by the Israeli government,'' Arafat told his Cabinet.
	   At their meeting late Friday, Palestinian ministers discussed
preparations for a unilateral declaration of statehood in May,
saying Palestinian emissaries would fan out to ``friendly
countries'' to seek pledges of recognition for any new state.
	   Earlier in the day, Palestinian parliament speaker Ahmed Qureia
had told The Associated Press the Palestinians might delay their
declaration if there were sufficient progress in negotiations with
Israel.
	   Netanyahu has hinted he would respond to any unilateral
proclamation of Palestinian statehood by annexing parts of the West
Bank, a move that would likely bring an explosion of violence.

Kosovo refugees unable to resettle after villages razed

	   LABUCEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Clumps of ash _ a door only days
earlier _ greet visitors to what's left of the two-story home of
refugee Besim Gashi, who recently descended from a chilly
mountaintop hideaway to find the ruins of his village.
	   Gashi's home is among thousands destroyed in the seven-month
crackdown on separatist Albanians in Serbia's Kosovo province.
Stepping on the sooty red tiles from his collapsed roof, Gashi, 32,
displays the sum of his household possessions _ a scorched mattress
spring and several pieces of blackened silverware.
	   ``We have no food or water,'' Gashi said. ``The police came at
our village from three sides, and we ran. When we came back, we
found this.''
	   A study by international observers made available Saturday shows
a fifth of nearly 20,000 houses randomly surveyed last month in
western Kosovo are uninhabitable and irreparable.
	   Yet Serb and Yugoslav authorities, claiming they've won their
war against the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and seeking to deflect
international criticism, are encouraging, sometimes forcing,
refugees to return home.
	   About 600 people have been killed and at least 275,000 civilians
forced to flee since the crackdown began in February. The latest
Serb offensive continued Saturday, with the guerrillas fleeing from
one of their last strongholds, north of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
	   Kosovo province is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia. Its population is 90 percent Albanian and demanding
independence.
	   The international study, obtained by The Associated Press,
surveyed about 220 villages and showed that in addition to the
4,400 irreparable homes, many more suffered major damage. It was
completed August 24, before many villages in western, northern and
southern Kosovo were gutted in more recent offensives.
	   Fear also gets in the way of refugees returning. Many tell
stories of friends and neighbors who tried to go back, only to be
driven off again _ or killed by shelling or gunfire.
	   ``We don't know if we can live here because police might come
again,'' said Gashi, who sleeps outside beneath a plastic sheet to
let 12 women sleep in the one relatively intact room of his
burned-out house. ``I'll feel better only if we can find out how to
live through the winter.''
	   Before all this, Gashi was looking forward to his final year of
economics studies in Pristina. Now, his main worry is what to eat
once the first prolonged frost destroys the berries and grapes so
many residents subsist on.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center says tens of thousands have
returned to their homes in recent weeks as fighting has died down
in many areas.
	   But Fernando del Mundo, the Kosovo spokesman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, says few refugees attempt to go home
because they fear attacks by Serb police.
	   The UNHCR said Friday that the latest offensive in northern
Kosovo had emptied at least 13 villages and sent more than 10,000
ethnic Albanians fleeing. ``The humanitarian crisis in Kosovo is
worsening by the day,'' said Kris Janowski, UNHCR spokesman in
Geneva.
	   Winter already is here in some regions, and an estimated 50,000
people are living in the open. The World Food Program on Friday
reported snowfalls in the border area with Albania forcing hundreds
of refugees to descend on foot to warmer regions.
	   Even if some refugees overcome their fear and return to rebuild,
they often have to start with nothing.
	   Aid agencies are delivering plastic sheeting, sleeping bags,
plywood and nails. But that's just the beginning for those who must
rebuild from the ground up.
	   In Labucevo, 45 miles (70 kilometers) west of Pristina, two
recent days of fires, fed by gasoline, reduced the village to a
jumble of roofless brick and concrete skeletons. A thousand people
now huddle here in fear and mourn the loss of nearly everything
built up over the generations.
	   They cook on open fires and sleep a dozen to a room in the few
structures where partial roofs keep out some rain.
	   For Gashi, the combination of gunfire and winter are frightening
prospects.
	   ``Here are only civilians with not even any weapons to fight,''
he says. ``Many will die.''

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   The skies were mostly clear in the Virgin Islands overnight but
partly to mostly cloudy across Puerto Rico. A weak tropical wave
passed through Puerto Rico during the night. Most of the rain
showers associated with this tropical wave were found by Doppler
radar to be over the Atlantic Ocean north of Puerto Rico and on the
north coast of Puerto Rico. The wind was calm or light from the
east. The temperatures ranged from 75 to 82 degrees.
	   High pressure ahead of hurricane Georges will provide partly to
mostly sunny skies to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands today and
Sunday. Rain showers will be isolated to only widely scattered as
the air mass will be much drier. It will become breezy Sunday
afternoon as the hurricane approaches the Lesser Antilles.
	   Hurricane Georges is a potential threat to the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico Monday and Tuesday. Even if the hurricane does not
make a direct hit to the Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico its effects
in the form of tropical storm force winds and high seas and swells
will be felt Monday and Tuesday. Therefore everyone living in the
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico must keep themselves abreast of the
latest information on Hurricane Georges. Since the weather will be
very good on this weekend the National Weather Service suggests
that you use this time to make preparations for the arrival of
Hurricane Georges and or its effects.

Kuchma satisfied by summit with Yeltsin despite lack of quick
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Returning home Saturday from a two-day
summit with Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, President Leonid Kuchma
said he was satisfied by the results of his meetings in Moscow.
	   Kuchma said he and Yeltsin had agreed to create an ``anti-crisis
group'' that will look into ways they can shore up their economies
together.
	   ``A friend in need is a friend indeed,'' Kuchma said before
leaving the Russian capital. ``If we do not help each other, no one
will help us.''
	   In particular, the two presidents said they would take urgent
measures to stop a decline in trade between the two countries,
Yeltsin's press service reported.
	   There also will be regular telephone consultations and bilateral
economic teams will intensify their work, Kuchma said, according to
the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies.
	   ``There was a serious desire by the Russian side to raise
bilateral ties to a new level,'' the Ukrainian president said,
adding that his talks with Yeltsin were ``absolutely honest.''
	   Kuchma also said he was impressed by his meeting with new
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. Both Yeltsin and Primakov
were determined to preserve Russia's strategic partnership with
Ukraine, he noted.
	   Kuchma had hoped for a major summit with Yeltsin in Ukraine,
with large delegations covering a wide range of issues. But
Russia's economic turmoil kept Yeltsin at home. The meetings in
Moscow were low-key and held behind closed doors.
	   Despite Kuchma's optimistic tone, he brought back little in the
way of practical results and no promise of an easy remedy for his
own struggling country.
	   The Russian crisis has put heavy pressure on Ukraine, a
neighboring nation of 50 million people. The hryvna currency
declined from 2.1 to the U.S. dollar in mid-August to 2.99 Friday
as the government was forced to expand its currency fluctuation
band. Investors have been leaving the shaky Ukrainian market.
	   Russia's financial downfall also is affecting Ukrainian exports.
Ukraine annually exports to Russia more than dlrs 10 billion worth
of commodities, or a third of its total exports. These exports were
decreasing even before the crisis.
	   Kuchma also did not bring back any clear answers to his proposal
for the creation of a free-trade zone between the two countries and
other former Soviet republics instead of the inefficient customs
union set up by several ex-Soviet nations.
	   The sides left the issue to expert groups, although Kuchma said
Yeltsin's response to the idea was ``positive.''
	   One tangible result of the summit, though, could be the reported
agreement in principle that cash-strapped Ukraine could pay in
commodities for a large part of Russian imports, including natural
gas supplies. Interfax quoted Kuchma as saying that Yeltsin already
has issued a corresponding order to his government.
	   It was not clear how the deal would affect the existing
Ukrainian debt for Russian gas deliveries, estimated at between
dlrs 640 million and around dlrs 1 billion.

Australian pair win lawn bowls gold

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Brett Duprez, selected for the
Australian team only four months ago, joined Mark Jacobsen to score
a 16-14 victory over Wales Saturday night in lawn bowls pairs at
the Commonwealth Games.
	   The two beat William Thomas and Robert Weale in the four-hour
match.
	   Team manager Don Sherman said the 23-year-old Duprez was asked
along only for the experience when team trials were held in May,
but bowled so well that he was chosen for the games.
	   He and Jacobsen, 30, were never behind, and led by four points
with four ends to play.
	   Malaysia and South Africa won bronze medals by finishing second
in their preliminary-round groups.

Former National Security Advisor Lake to lead peace initiative
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ The United States will launch a new peace
initiative to end the four-month border conflict between Eritrea
and Ethiopia, the Eritrean Foreign Ministry said.
	   In a statement released Friday, the ministry said President
Clinton's national security office informed President Isaias
Afwerki on Wednesday of its desire to work out a peaceful solution
to the conflict and would send former national security advisor
Anthony Lake to both countries in the Horn of Africa.
	   Previous U.S. attempts to negotiate a peaceful settlement led by
Assitant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice were
unsuccessful.
	   The statement referred to the effort as ``unwarranted
interference.''
	   ``President Isaias has underlined the reservations of the
Eritrean Government wil expressing its readiness to receive the
U.S. envoy,'' the statement said.
	   In a television interview Thursday, the Eritrean leader repeated
his hopes for a peaceful resolution to the border dispute that
turned violent in early May.
	   He characterized Ethiopia's recent claim that they were ready to
start fighting again as ``an empty kettle making much noise.''
	   ``Now as before, the only solution is trhough peaceful and legal
means,'' Isaias said. ``No provocation is going to derail us from
the peaceful course we have taken.''
	   On Sept. 9, the U.S. Congress adopted a resolution calling on
both countries to declare an immediate cease-fire.
	   Although no significant fighting has been reported since June,
both countries have been beefing up their entrenched positions
along their common 1,000-kilometer (625-mile) border.
	   Eritrea claims it is on territory that is rightful its own
according to internationally recognized boundaries Italian colonial
boundaries.
	   Ethiopia claims that Eritrean troops are occupying its territory
and will not enter peace talks until they withdraw.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after having
been annexed by Addis Ababa in the early 1960s after passing from
Italian to British to United Nations control.

Report: Charges still being considered against former GM exec
</HEADLINE>
Lopez &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A former top General Motors Corp. executive in
Europe who was involved one of the auto industry's biggest
industrial espionage cases may face criminal charges in the United
States, a German newsmagazine reported Saturday.
	   Jose Ignacio Lopez and three former GM colleagues were accused
of taking important GM research, planning and sales documents with
them when they suddenly jumped ship to Volkswagen in 1993.
	   German prosecutors agreed in July to drop charges of betraying
trade and company secrets against them in exchange for fines.
	   But the Munich-based Focus magazine said it had learned U.S.
authorities were still considering charges. It said federal
prosecutors want to bring new witnesses from GM's legal department
and international management to testify before a grand jury in
Detroit about his 1993 move.
	   VW agreed in January 1997 to pay GM dlrs 100 million and buy
dlrs 1 billion worth of GM parts to settle a civil suit.

Politician says men were forced into sodomy accusations.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The threat of arrest for
Malaysia's most popular rebel politician heightened Saturday when
two men in a court hearing said he had sodomized them.
	   The adopted brother and aide of former deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim pleaded guilty to sodomy in a court hearing, where
they were each sentenced to six months in prison, the official
Bernama news agency reported.
	   Anwar, 51, said the two men had been tortured in a way that
``even the strongest would crumble,'' and forced into the
confessions. He denied there was any ``iota of truth'' in them.
	   The latest charge could lead to Anwar's arrest in conservative
Muslim Malaysia.
	   Police have said Anwar may be arrested any day on allegations
that include sexual misconduct and treason. He has not been
formally charged.
	   Anwar, once Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's heir-apparent, has
said he is being targeted because he has become a serious challenge
to Mahathir's grip on power.
	   Anwar, who was fired as deputy prime minister and finance
minister Sept. 2, has recently embarked on a national campaign,
making speeches that have drawn enthusiastic crowds. He has called
on Mahathir to step down, accusing him of corruption.
	   That is an extraordinary, and dangerous, challenge to make
against the 73-year-old leader who has not tolerated such displays
of defiance during his 17 years in power.
	   Mahathir ``has given instructions to continue these massive
arrests of people, intimidation and torture,'' Anwar said at a news
conference at his home Saturday, before heading south for another
public rally. ``I thought he is no longer very sane.''
	   Mahathir has blasted Anwar's appearance on opposition party
platforms and said the attacks Anwar had made against the nation's
judiciary are a ploy to claim unfair trial later. Mahathir warned
Saturday that Anwar's public speeches were illegal.
	   Since Sept. 6, police arrested Anwar's adopted brother, two
friends and two former private secretaries. None had been heard
from until Saturday.
	   Anwar's brother and friend were prevented from speaking to
family or their own lawyers during police interrogation and the
court hearing.
	   ``Why are they so scared?'' Anwar asked of the authorities.
	   ``Because they have been torturing this poor guy and forced him
to make confessions,'' he said.
	   Sukma Dermawan, 37, a businessman who is Anwar's adopted
brother, was taken away by police without explanation on Sept. 6.
	   Bernama reported that he accused Anwar of sodomizing him in
April in his room at the deputy prime minister's official
residence.
	   Anwar's friend and sometime speech writer, Munawar Anees, 51,
said he had been sodomized at Anwar's private residence in 1993,
Bernama said.
	   Anees was arrested Sept. 14 under the Internal Security Act,
which allows indefinite imprisonment without trial.
	   Anwar said his family had never heard of the attorney who
appeared as his brother's defender.

San Gennaro: Miracle in hands of cardinal implicated in
</HEADLINE>
loan-sharking probe &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ A flask of saint's blood appeared to
liquefy Saturday in the hands of Naples' cardinal, sparking
immediate, impassioned debate among Italians over whether it was a
sign of divine favor for the cardinal in his loan-sharking case.
	   After 50 minutes of intense prayer, Cardinal Michele Giordano
displayed the phial of St. Gennaro's blood, drawing applause from
3,000 jubilant worshippers in Naples' cathedral.
	   ``I thank you all for your extraordinary participation in this
act of faith,'' said the prelate, who had smiled but occasionally
appeared tense while praying and turning the ampule. News outlets
throughout Italy proclaimed a miracle.
	   The blood of St. Gennaro, patron saint of Naples, has been seen
to liquefy hundreds of times, including regularly on the Sept. 19
anniversary of his martyrdom at the hands of the Emperor Diocletian
in 305.
	   This anniversary, and suspense over whether this might be a year
when the miracle failed to happen, had added political importance
given the cardinal's implication in a loan-sharking case.
	   Giordano's brother was arrested in August on suspicion of
involvement in a high-dollar loan-sharking ring. Dozens of police
later raided the cardinal's office, searching for any evidence that
his money or church money were used in loan-sharking.
	   The cardinal acknowledges loaning his brother money but denies
wrongdoing.
	   Saturday, a handful of worshippers challenged Giordano before he
had even made it out of the church.
	   ``Shame!,'' they cried. ``We are here for St. Gennaro, not for
the cardinal! Shame! You are not worthy of Naples!''
	   Two factions immediately formed at the cathedral, one for the
cardinal, one against.
	   ``Shame on you!'' one woman, a supporter of Giordano, told the
other side. ``He who is without sin, cast the first stone!''
	   The argument continued in Italian's political circles, where
many of the cardinal's supporters and many in the opposition have
decried the raid on his office as a sign that Italy's crusading
magistrates have gone too far.
	   Raffaele Calabro, head of the regional governing council,
insisted that Saturday's liquefaction was a sign as well _ a sign
that the cardinal ``is good luck for the city, the region, the
diocese and all their institutions.''

Floods kill four in Sudan, displace thousands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Torrential rains unleashed floods in
northern Sudan, killing four people and leaving thousands homeless,
a Sudanese relief official said Saturday.
	   The rains lasted three hours Friday evening, and relief teams
could not travel roads to the stricken areas until Saturday, said
Mohi-Eddine Titawi, spokesman for the government's Relief
Committee.
	   Relief workers believed at least 600 homes were destroyed and
thousands were left without shelter, Titawi said in a statement
carried by state-run Omdurman Radio. Four people died, he said.
	   On Thursday, heavy rains along the Nile River swept away 500
homes, killing at least five people.
	   ``We have not seen such rains for tens of years,'' Titawi said.
	   This year's flood of the Nile River, the worst in decades,
already has caused 40 billion Sudanese pounds (dlrs 19 million) in
damage to homes and farms. Last week, officials reported 200,000
people driven from their homes in eight states.
	   On Saturday, Syria sent 80 metric tons (88 tons) of food and
medicine by plane to help Sudanese affected by the floods, Syrian
Health Minister Iyad Shatti said in the Syrian capital, Damascus.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Authorities arrested
three people and rescued several minors they said were used for
prostitution and to make pornographic videos, officials said
Saturday.
	   One of the three arrested was the grandmother of one of the
minors. She was charged with complicity in the operation.
	   Investigators seized 72 videos and said they believed the
suspects had connections in Puerto Rico, St. Martin and Thailand.
	   The Dominican authorities identified the two main suspects as
Finn Jensen, 66, a Danish citizen, and Hubert Barkhasse, 82, a U.S.
citizen.
	   Police said Berrita Almonte Pena, the grandmother of a
3-year-old who was allegedly one of the victims, was arrested
because she knew what was happening although she was not a
participant.
	   Police said Barkhasse, originally from Philadelphia, brought
homosexual men from the United States and Thailand to the Dominican
Republic for sex with minors. He also allegedly traveled to St.
Martin with the minors.
	   The two suspects also traveled frequently to Puerto Rico, and
investigators believe they distributed their videos there.

 &UR; Malaysia adds Singapore naval search ships to territory ban
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Malaysia's ban on ships; CHANGES
dateline, overline.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Defense Ministry banned
Singaporean naval vessels Saturday from entering Malaysian waters
on search and rescue missions without prior approval, the Bernama
national news agency said.
	   The ban follows a similar restriction Malaysia imposed Friday on
military aircraft. Previously, there had been a blanket approval on
Singapore ships and planes. A case-by-case approval is now needed.
	   There was no immediate reaction from Singapore, whose defense
ministry had said earlier Saturday that the air force has been
going ahead with ``its usual training and operational flights,''
while observing the flight ban.
	   The Malaysian decision was seen as an escalation of the
diplomatic wrangle that has gripped the neighboring Southeast Asian
nations for weeks.
	   Malaysian officials said the limit on flyovers had been planned
for some time, and denied that it was retaliation for the memoirs
published Thursday by Singapore's most powerful man, Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
	   Malaysian politicians say the book, which accused the Malaysian
leadership of corruption, racist policies and lax morals, has hurt
relations between the two countries that were merged from 1963-65.
	   The two countries have bickered recently over everything from
the relocation of a railroad border post to water supplies, for
which Singapore relies heavily on its northern neighbor.
	   Bernama quoted Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar as
saying Singapore aircraft and vessels had used the past blanket
approval as an excuse to enter or leave Malaysian territory at
will, without informing local authorities.
	   ``It is as if they are entering their own country,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``This situation cannot be allowed to go on.''

Authorities detain two more officials in water scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Authorities detained two more Jordanian
officials Saturday for questioning about polluted drinking water in
a scandal that led to the government's resignation last month.
	   Munther Khleifat, a secretary-general at the Ministry of Water
and Irrigation, and his assistant, Saad Al-Bakri, were detained for
two weeks for suspicion of involvement in the water scandal,
officials said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   District Attorney Mohammed Harahsheh is investigating charges
that the two were involved in ``producing and distributing a
drinking substance which is unfit for human consumption'' and
``violating the obligation of the job,'' they said.
	   The state has accused eight other officials, including Water
Minister Munther Haddadin, of having a role in the scandal.
	   Haddadin stepped down last month following angry protests by
residents of the capital, Amman, who complained their drinking
water had larvae and an odor. The remaining 22 minister then
resigned.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario took
advantage of a struggling Patty Schnyder and beat the Swiss 6-1,
3-6, 6-2 Saturday to give Spain a 1-0 lead in the Fed Cup Final.
	   Despite the 10,000 Swiss flag-waving spectators packing the
Palexpo, Sanchez-Vicario prevailed in the 2-hour, 25-minute contest
that swung back-and-forth.
	   ``It was important to win the first point for Spain,''
Sanchez-Vicario said. ``The second match will be up to Conchita
(Martinez). All I can do now is try to get points for my country in
my next matches.''
	   Martinez faced off against top-ranked Martina Hingis later
Saturday in the second singles of the best-of-5 tie.
	   Supported by Spain's own little contingent of fans, clacking
castanets and tambourines, Sanchez-Vicario dominated the first set
with Schnyder often aiding to her own defeat.
	   The Swiss teenager double-faulted on break point to give
Sanchez-Vicario a 3-1 advantage, then let the Spaniard make the
most of two break points to go ahead 5-1.
	   It was only when she was broken on her opening serve in the
second set that Schnyder finally came to life. She began to display
the form which earned her five tournament titles this season and
lifted her from 26th to ninth in the WTA Tour rankings.
	   Spurred by the crowd, Schnyder immediately broke back and then
held to even the score 2-2.
	   At 4-3, Schnyder again broke Sanchez-Vicario and held to even
the match.
	   Maintaining the momentum, the 19-year-old Swiss broke
Sanchez-Vicario to open the final set and send the crowd into a
frenzy.
	   But drawing on the experience and determination which have
helped her lead Spain to four Fed Cup titles, Sanchez-Vicario
settled herself, and broke twice to lead 4-2.
	   Schnyder had the opportunity to get back to 4-3 in the next
game, but squandered three break points and allowed Sanchez-Vicario
to go ahead 5-2.
	   Sanchez-Vicario then broke her opponent one last time to give
Spain the first point.
	   ``I dominated in the first set,'' the 26-year-old
Sanchez-Vicario said. ``She came back hard in the second, attacking
more.
	   ``But down 2-0 in the last set, I concentrated more, attacked
more and that's what won me the match.''
	   For Schnyder, the loss was devastating.
	   ``Each exchange was so long,'' said Schnyder, close to tears.
``I tried everything I could. In the second set I was able to
comeback but I was tired out in the last set.''

Shearer scores twice as Newcastle starts playing `sexy football'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Newcastle fans have been talking about ``sexy
football'' since Ruud Gullit was named in a surprise last month as
the new coach.
	   Well, they got it Saturday.
	   With Alan Shearer scoring twice to give the England
international five goals in his last three game, Newcastle
dismantled Coventry 5-1 to move into the chase in England's Premier
League.
	   Almost lost in the shadow was Derby's convincing 2-0 home
victory over Leicester, moving Derby into second place with 12
points behind league-leading Aston Villa's 14.
	   Villa had to settle for a 0-0 draw at Leeds as neither team
showed the kind of firepower they'll need to make them convincing
challengers when the league ends in eight months.
	   Liverpool slipped from second to third place with 11 points
after a disappointing 3-3 home draw against newly promoted
Charlton. On the brighter side, Robbie Fowler did score twice in
his return to the starting lineup following injury.
	   Wimbledon also moved up to 11 points with a 2-1 home victory
over Sheffield Wednesday, the 'Dons best start in six seasons.
	   At the bottom of the standings there was also good news for
Southampton, which picked up it first point of the season with a
1-1 draw against Tottenham. Spurs started Hans Segers in goal.
	   The Dutch goalkeeper _ who made his name in England playing with
Wimbledon _ was cleared of match-fixing charges last year by an
English court in a case that also involved former Liverpool and
Southampton 'keeper Bruce Grobbelaar.
	   In other Premier League games Saturday: Middlesbrough 2, Everton
2; Nottingham Forest 0, West Ham 0.
	   On Sunday, Manchester United played at Arsenal in a clash
between two of England's biggest clubs. On Monday, the Premier
League completes it round with Chelsea at Blackburn.
	   In England's first division, Huddersfield won its fifth straight
game _ 2-1 over Wolverhampton _ to take sole possession of first
place with 19 points. Sunderland lashed Oxford United 7-0 and moved
into second with 18, followed by Birmingmam City and Bury with 16
apiece.
	   In Scotland, Ranger stayed on top with 10 points pending their
key Sunday match with cross-town rival Celtic. Last season Celtic
ended Rangers' nine-season run on the Premier Division title.
	   Kilmarnock and Motherwell drew 0-0 to stay tied for second with
nine points each. Also on Saturday, St. Johnstone defeated Aberdeen
2-0. St. Johnstone has eight points along with Celtic and Aberdeen.

Tyson apologizes again, promises to behave

	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson apologized once again on Saturday
for biting Evander Holyfield's ears during a title bout and
promised the Nevada state Athletic Commission that he would behave
himself if he is allowed to return to the ring.
	   The commission hearing began with Tyson lawyer Dale Kinsella
reading a letter from the former heavyweight champ to commission
chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem.
	   ``I acknowledge that I made a mistake and again I apologize for
it,'' Tyson said in the letter. ``I assure you this kind of
behavior will not repeat itself. Let's put this behind us and allow
boxing to be what it should be, the best sport in the world.''
	   Tyson is nearly broke and can't afford to wait another year to
return to the ring, adviser Shelly Finkel says. The commission's
ban last year has cost him tens of millions of dollars.

Central Bank official claims success in jump-starting banks

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank's program to jump-start the
country's paralyzed banking system has already opened the way for
some banks to pay their debts, a bank official said Saturday.
	   Reviving the commercial banks' activities is one of the
priorities Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, has set
for his economic crisis-fighting government.
	   The economy has been at a near-standstill after the events of
the past month, during which the nation's currency has been
devalued, the country has defaulted on its loans and has changed
governments. Primakov, who was confirmed by parliament on Sept. 11,
has yet to name his whole Cabinet.
	   Commercial banks in particular have been brought to the brink of
bankruptcy, and their virtual shutdown for the past two weeks has
brought other commercial activities to a standstill.
	   Andrei Kozlov, the first deputy chairman of the Central Bank,
said that the program started Friday to help the banks pay off
their debts had been successful, the Interfax news agency reported.
The Central Bank is helping banks clear their debts to one another
by a so-called debt swap system _ allowing them to use reserves
stored in the Central Bank to pay their liabilities.
	   ``The clearing of bank payments as a whole has proceeded
successfully,'' Interfax quoted Kozlov as saying. He said it had
gone particularly well in Saint Petersburg, Samara and
Yekaterinburg _ whereas the vast majority of banks are concentrated
in Moscow.
	   The Central Bank has also promised to buy government bonds held
by the commercial banks at prices much higher than their actual
market value. The move is intended to prime the banks' pumps so
they can begin paying debts and getting money back into the
economy.
	   The debt swap is expected to involve the printing of billions of
new rubles, which almost certainly will contribute to inflation.
Consumer prices have already begun to soar after being kept under
control for more than a year.
	   The new government's economic program is still being worked out.
According to officials' statements so far, the program will include
the imposition of some Soviet-style controls over the economy.
	   The Communist Party, the dominant voice in the
opposition-dominated parliament, has so far acquiesced in the
economic program. One of its members, new Deputy Prime Minister
Yuri Maslyukov, is taking part in the program's formulation.
	   Yet the party called at its annual plenum on Saturday for a new
``government of national interests.''
	   Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said that Primakov's government
did not ``represent the interests of the majority in the
(parliament),'' and that the Communists favored a Cabinet
representing the interests of ``the entire population, the entire
country, and not those of the International Monetary Fund,''
Interfax reported.
	   Zyuganov said his supporters would demand that the new
government support Russian industry and set an official minimum
standard of living.
	   He said that the party also was sticking to its demand for
President Boris Yeltsin to leave office, and for constitutional
changes so that the government ``does not depend on Mr. Yeltsin's
mood,'' Interfax reported.
	   The Communists concentrated at their plenum on fine-tuning plans
for a national day of protest scheduled for Oct. 7.
	   Yeltsin, meanwhile, met Saturday with Ukrainian counterpart,
Leonid Kuchma, whose own country is taking a pounding from the
economic storm lashing Russia. The two leaders agreed to create an
``anti-crisis group'' that will look into ways they can shore up
their economies together, and will work to stop a decline in
bilateral trade, Yeltsin's press service said.

A look at Sweden and its national elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sweden-Elections &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Facts and figures on Sweden, which holds national elections
Sunday:
	   ___
	   GEOGRAPHY: Long and narrow Sweden covers nearly 411,000 square
kilometers (158,000 square miles) _ about the size of California _
and is bounded by Norway, Finland and the Baltic Sea.
	   ___
	   POPULATION: About 8.8 million, of whom nearly one in five is an
immigrant or has immigrant parents. Some 85 percent of Swedes are
nominally members of the Lutheran Church of Sweden, although only
about 5 percent attend church regularly. Literacy is 100 percent,
life expectancy is among the world's highest _ 75.7 years for men,
80.7 for women _ and the United Nations Development Program says
Sweden has the world's smallest percentage of poor residents.
	   ___
	   GOVERNMENT: Constitutional monarchy, with a 349-seat
single-chamber parliament, the Riksdag.
	   ___
	   HISTORY: Once a major European military power, Sweden has not
fought a war since 1815. It is officially neutral but participates
in NATO's Partnership for Peace. It is a member of the European
Union, thoug it opted out of the first round of the EU's
single-currency program.
	   A century ago, Sweden had one of Europe's most economically
divided societies, but in the 20th century developed its ``middle
way'' mix of capitalism and socialism that created a
cradle-to-grave social welfare system.
	   ___
	   INDUSTRY: Sweden is a major exporter of telecommunications
equipment, automobiles, forest products and precision machinery.
	   ___
	   ECONOMY: After a slump in the early 1990s as the costs of the
welfare state grew, Sweden has reduced unemployment from double
digits to about 7 percent. Inflation is negligible and the
government predicts a small budget surplus this year. The tax
burden, about 53 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, is the
world's highest.
	   ___
	   ELECTION: Voting is for all parliament seats and municipal and
county elections. Seven parties are expected to win parliament
seats, ranging from the ex-communist Left Party to the conservative
Christian Democrats. The Social Democrats, who have governed for
most of this century, are expected retain power. The election
campaign focused on reducing unemployment and restoring social
services.

international official said Saturday that preliminary election
results show moderates doing well in other races.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
organized the Sept. 12-13 Bosnian elections, has not commented on
reports that the U.S.-backed incumbent, Biljana Plavsic is badly
trailing to an ultranationalist rival in the race for the Bosnian
Serb presidency.
	   Despite accusations from backers of Nikola Poplasen, Plavsic's
hardline challenger, that the delay is an attempt at vote
manipulation, the OSCE says no results will be released until a
final tally is available later this week.
	   A Plavsic defeat would be a humiliating setback for U.S.-led
efforts to boost the popularity of moderates among Bosnian Serbs
and sideline the extremist supporters of indicted war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic, including Poplasen.
	   It could also call into question the entire U.S.-European
strategy, which has been to funnel millions of dollars in aid to
those who support a multi-ethnic, unified Bosnian state.
	   But on Thursday, international officials put a more promising
spin on the elections.
	   Officials familiar with the race for the Bosnian Serb presidency
have said Plavsic cannot hope to catch Poplasen. While refusing
specific comment on that race, Simon Haselock, a spokesman for
Bosnia's top international mediator, Carlos Westendorp, said
Saturday other preliminary vote counts were encouraging.
	   ``The trend that we now see is generally away from nationalist
parties,'' said Haselock.
	   Western diplomats hope that a strong showing of moderate parties
in the assembly of the Serb-held half of the country may neutralize
eventual attempts of Poplasen to move away from Bosnia's peace
accord emphasizing democracy and ethnic reconciliation.
	   A senior western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity
said Saturday moderate opposition parties were doing well on most
levels _ the Serb substate, the Muslim-Croat federation making up
the other half of Bosnia and the all-Bosnian parliament.
	   In the 83-seat Bosnian Serb assembly, opposition parties seem to
have won an additional four seats, giving them a majority of 48
seats.
	   In the 15-seat Lower House of the Bosnian joint parliament, the
pro-Plavsic coalition appears to have won at least two of five Serb
seats. Previously Serb hard-liners held all five seats.
	   In addition, the senior diplomat said, the pro-Western Serb
candidate for the three-member joint presidency, Zivko Radisic, has
a clear lead over the hardline candidate, Momcilo Krajisnik.
	   But the Western-backed Croat candidate, Kresimir Zuback
apparently has lost to Ante Jelavic, a Croat hardliner, indicating
that most Bosnian Croats still are opposed to coexistence with
Serbs and Muslims.
	   Alija Izetbegovic, the wartime leader of the Muslims and the
Muslim incumbent on the joint presidency was winning.
	   The western diplomat said a last-minute candidacy by a Muslim
for the presidency of the Bosnian Serb republic drew away tens of
thousands of Muslim votes from Plavsic and helped Poplasen.
	   Western powers now fear Poplasen would use the considerable
powers of the office _ ability to propose a Prime Minister and
eventually dissolve the parliament _ to reinforce his hard-liners.
	   Yet, they believe they will be able to work with Poplasen.
	   ``Even if Mr. Poplasen was to win against Mrs. Plavsic, given
the trend, he is unlikely to be in any particularly strong
position,'' Haselock said.

First seed Clavet to meet Di Pasquale in finals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ First seed Francisco Clavet easily
defeated fellow Spaniard Albert Portas to get to the finals of the
dlrs 350,000 Romanian Open.
	   In the other semifinals match, unseeded Arnaud Di Pasquale of
France struggled past Romanian Adrian Voinea 6-3, 2-6, 7-5.
	   Clavet lost the first set only to roar back for a 3-6, 6-0, 6-2
victory.
	   Di Pasquale and Voinea played long and powerful balls weakening
each other's resistance. After he won the first set, Di Pasquale
was dominated by the unseeded Romanian through the second set.
	   Di Pasquale finally won after his opponent made a series of
unforced mistakes on the Progresul arena's clay court.
	   Both matches were delayed several hours by heavy rain.

Four killed, three missing in aftermath of tropical storm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two fishermen and two swimmers were killed Saturday
in rough seas and three people went missing in a mudslide, all
casualties in Japan of Tropical Storm Todd.
	   The bodies of the fishermen were found in Shizuoka Prefecture
(state) in central Japan after their boats turned over, police
said.
	   In a separate accident, two college students drowned and were
washed ashore on a nearby beach, they said.
	   As of late Saturday, the storm was moving across the East China
Sea, west of Japan, at a speed of 20 kph (12 mph), packing winds up
to 83 kph (51 mph) and leaving a trail of dangerously rough waters.
	   The storm is headed toward China and was not expected to pass
over Japan, government weather forecasters said.
	   In Umaji village, about 650 kilometers (400 miles) southwest of
Tokyo, three construction workers were swallowed by a mudslide,
Kochi Prefectural (state) police said.
	   They were among four people setting up nets on a rain-soaked
hillside to prevent landslides, they said. The fourth fled to
safety.
	   Rainfall in Umaji totaled 231 millimeters (9 inches) from 11
a.m. (0200 GMT) Friday to 5 p.m. (0800 GMT) Saturday, the
Meteorological Agency said.
	   On Friday, six people suffered minor cuts in southern island of
Kyushu when struck by glass and other objects hurled through the
air by the storm's gusty winds.

Grenade kills two children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Albania (AP) _ Two children, aged 10 and 13, were
killed Saturday after a grenade left by fighting exploded, a human
rights organization reported.
	   The non-governmental Council for the Defense of Human Rights and
Freedoms said four more children were wounded in the same blast
near Leskovac, a village in the Prizren area, 65 kilometers (40
miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   All the victims were ethnic Albanian. The wounded were
transported to Pristina hospital in serious condition.
	   The area around Prizren was the site last month of heavy clashes
between independence-seeking ethnic Albanian guerrillas and an
alliance of Serbian police and the Yugoslav army.

Tyson apologizes again, promises to behave
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more detail; WILL be UPDATED. &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson apologized once again Saturday for
biting Evander Holyfield's ears during a title bout and promised
the Nevada state Athletic Commission that he would behave himself
if he is allowed to return to the ring.
	   The hearing to determine whether Tyson will regain his boxing
license in the western American state began with lawyer Dale
Kinsella reading a letter from the former heavyweight boxing champ
to commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem.
	   ``I acknowledge that I made a mistake and again I apologize for
it,'' Tyson said in the letter. ``I assure you this kind of
behavior will not repeat itself. Let's put this behind us and allow
boxing to be what it should be, the best sport in the world.''
	   Tyson is nearly broke and can't afford to wait another year to
return to the ring, adviser Shelly Finkel says. The commission's
ban last year has cost him tens of millions of dollars.
	   Tyson arrived at the building on a motorcycle, wearing a leather
jacket, jeans and a T-shirt. He entered the meeting room surrounded
by bodyguards and an entourage with about a dozen people.
	   On a hill next to the building stood a green, 3-meter (10-foot)
sign that said: ``Mike Tyson is still our hero.'' Six protesters of
the feminist group the National Organization for Women demonstrated
outside the building.
	   Tyson must convince the commission to allow him to return to the
sport he once dominated. If not, he might find some other country
to fight in, Finkel says.
	   ``I have loads of offers and I've turned them all down so far,''
he said. ``I don't know what I'm going to do if he isn't licensed,
though. His financial situation is very bad and he needs to
fight.''
	   Approval means Tyson could fight again in Nevada _ a popular and
lucrative venue major for bouts due to its casino gambling industry
_ before the end of the year. Rejection would mean another year on
the sidelines _ at least in Nevada and the other American states
that honor its suspension _ and threaten a career that was fading
even before he bit Holyfield.
	   ``Mike Tyson will have to rise to the occasion during his
licensing because it's going to be a test of what kind of person he
is,'' Ghanem said before the hearing. ``They call him Iron Mike,
but we're going to have to wait and see.''
	   Tyson reportedly has had offers from promoters in other
countries to fight for lucrative purses, money he needs despite
having made more than dlrs 100 million in the ring in the two years
before the last Holyfield fight.
	   The Internal Revenue Service, the American federal tax
collection agency, has put a dlrs 6.3 million lien on Tyson's
mansion about 150 kilometers (90 miles) northeast of New York City,
and Finkel says the fighter's finances are ``very bad.''
	   Other American states have so far honored Nevada's ban on Tyson,
and would probably continue to do so if he were denied a license.
But he could fight out of the country for the same kind of money he
would make in the United States.
	   Tyson's fate is in the same hands of the commission that banned
him from the sport and fined him dlrs 3 million last year.
	   This time, though, the decision is complicated by another
incident, the timing of which couldn't have been worse for the
former champion. Tyson is accused of attacking two men following a
automobile accident last month in a Washington, D.C., suburb. The
criminal charges could threaten his probation in the central state
of Indiana on a rape conviction.
	   Tyson's chances of regaining his license _ which many thought a
forgone conclusion as late as a few weeks ago _ are clouded again.
	   ``The whole issue is his temper and self-control,'' Ghanem said.
``Everything that has happened since we revoked his license we have
to find out about.''
	   Tyson has been seeing a Denver psychotherapist over the past
week, who was to appear to lobby on his behalf.

<TEXT>
	   ZARAGOZA, Spain (AP) _ German Marcel Wust of Festina captured
the 14th stage of the Tour of Spain Saturday in a sprint duel with
Russian Serguei Smetanine.
	   But the overall lead stayed with Spain's Abraham Olano of the
Banesto team with a 35-second cushion over Frenchman Laurent
Jalabert of ONCE-Deutsche Bank and 51 over No. 3 Fernando Escartin
of Spain and the Kelme Costa-Blanca team.
	   Wust edged out Smetanine and crossed the finish line in this
northern city in 2 hours, 50 minutes, 43 seconds. Wust finished
with a big pack of riders and all were given the same times.
	   The race covered 145-kilometers (88 miles) from Biescas to the
city of Zaragoza, leaving the Pyrenees Mountains behind.
	   Wust gave Festina, which was kicked out of July's Tour de France
after admitting to systematic drug use, its first win in this
year's Tour of Spain, the third big cycling race of the season
after the Tour of France and the Italian Giro.
	   Sunday's 15th leg covers 178 kilometers (112 miles) from
Zaragoza to the Castilian town of Soria and begins the race's final
week. The 22-stage tour will wrap up with several legs in the
mountains outside Madrid, and a key time-trial in the town of
Fuenlabrada.

Hingis beats Martinez to tie Swiss with Spain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS, UPDATES with Hingis-Martinez match, will be updated
with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ World No. 1 Martina Hingis defeated
Conchita Martinez to tie Switzerland 1-1 with Spain after two
matches of the Federation Cup world group final Saturday.
	   Some 12,000 frantic spectators packing the Palexpo watched in
relief as Hingis posted a solid 6-4, 6-4 win over Martinez, to even
the score between the nations.
	   Spain had taken the lead earlier in the day when Roland Garros
champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario defeated Patty Schnyder 6-2, 3-6,
6-2 in a roller-coaster match which lasted 2 hours, 25 minutes.
	   The 1-1 draw set the stage for an exciting, tense showdown in
the reverse singles Sunday when Sanchez Vicario plays Hingis, and
Schnyder plays Martinez.
	   Hingis, who has a 7-1 record over Sanchez-Vicario, winning the
last six times, most recently defeated the Spaniard in straight
sets in the semifinals in Manhatten, after eliminating her in the
quarterfinals at Wimbledon.
	   In the doubles the two veteran Spaniards, who together have led
Spain to all four of its titles, will join to play the two Swiss
teenagers.
	   Hingis and Martinez traded breaks twice in a see-saw opening
set, before Hingis, leading 5-4, took advantage of two set points
to close the set.
	   The second set was just as rocky, with Hingis breaking to go up
4-2. Up 5-3 with two match points, it appeared Hingis was poised to
close out the match. But the 17-year-old lost the next four points
_ and her temper _ allowing Martinez to get back within one.
	   Her pride stung by the set-back, Hingis stormed back on
Martinez's final serve, breaking the Spaniard with a love set to
take the match.
	   Supported by Spain's own little contingent of fans, clacking
castagnets and tambourines, Sanchez-Vicario dominated the first set
of her match against Schynder, the Swiss teenager often aiding the
Spaniard's campaign herself.
	   Making one unforced error after another, Schnyder gave up her
second and third serves in the opening set.
	   It was only when she was broken on her opening serve in the
second set that Schnyder suddenly came to life, finally displaying
the form which led her to five tournament wins this season, and
which lifted her from 26th to ninth in the WTA Tour rankings.
	   Spurred on by the crowd, Schnyder broke Sanchez-Vicario twice in
the second set to even the score, then broke the Spaniard's opening
serve in the final set.
	   But Sanchez-Vicario drew on the experience and determination
which helped her lead Spain to four Fed Cup titles, breaking back
to go up 4-2. Schnyder then squandered three break points, allowing
Sanchez-Vicario to jump ahead 5-2, and put the game out of reach.
	   ``It was important to win the first point for Spain,'' said
Sanchez-Vicario. ``All I can do now is try to get points for my
country in my next matches.''
	   For Schnyder, the loss was devastating.
	   ``Each exchange was so long,'' said Schnyder, close to tears.
``I tried everything I could. In the second set I was able to
comeback but I was tired out in the last set.''

Lebanese citizen sent to U.S. to face forgery charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ A Lebanese citizen in custody of FBI
agents left Paraguay for New York on Saturday to face charges of
forging U.S. documents for the Hezbollah guerrilla force, police
said.
	   Muhammad Garib Makki, 39, was detained Thursday at Ciudad del
Este, 390 kilometers (240 miles) east of Paraguay's capital,
Asuncion.
	   Garib Makki faces charges of forging U.S. passports, visas and
immigration green cards for Lebanon-based Hezbollah, an Iran-backed
Shiite Muslim force, a Paraguayan police spokesman said.
	   Garib Makki had a U.S. passport. The spokesman did not indicate
whether it was forged.
	   Ciudad del Este, near Paraguay's borders with Brazil and
Argentina, has a large Muslim community.
	   U.S. and Israeli intelligence suspect the terrorist attacks that
razed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1992 and
the Buenos Aires Jewish community center AMIA in 1995 received
support from the area.
	   The attacks, which caused 115 deaths, have not been solved.
	   The Buenos Aires daily Clarin quoted Buenos Aires judicial
sources as saying Garib Makki has no known connection with the
attacks in the Argentine capital.

Primakov meets Caucasus leaders, security officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of the Caucasus republic of Ingushetia
called on Saturday for joint administration of a district riven by
tension between two ethnic groups.
	   Ruslan Aushev, the president of Ingushetia, put forward his
proposal at a meeting chaired by Russia's new prime minister,
Yevgeny Primakov. The meeting was convened to try to calm tensions
in the Prigorod district of the republic of North Ossetia, which
borders on Ingushetia.
	   Last weekend, unidentified attackers killed five Ossetian
policemen, and Ossetians tried to exact revenge by setting ablaze
the homes of ethnic Ingush refugees in the Prigorod district.
Ethnic Ingush comprise much of the population in the district,
which lies within North Ossetia.
	   Aushev said Saturday that the district should be jointly
administered by Ingush and Ossetian officials, since North Ossetian
police were allegedly inflaming tensions.
	   The president of North Ossetia, Alexander Dzasokhov, immediately
rejected Aushev's accusation and his proposal. He said the main
task before regional leaders was to ``find the criminals once and
for all.''
	   At the meeting, Primakov ordered federal police to investigate
the arson attacks against the refugees last weekend.
	   The Ossetian-Ingush conflict goes back to a 1944 decision by
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin to deport the entire Ingush nation for
collaborating with the Nazis during World War II.
	   When the Ingush were permitted to return to the Caucasus in
1957, they found their homes inhabited by Ossetians. Ever since,
both groups have claimed territory that is now part of North
Ossetia.

Labor chooses candidates to lead Scottish, Welsh assemblies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The governing Labor Party on Saturday chose its
candidates to lead new assemblies in Scotland and Wales that will
be established after elections next year.
	   At Newport, southern Wales, 68.22 percent of the 300 delegates
to a special electoral college chose Ron Davies, currently
Britain's senior official in Wales, to lead the party in the new
Welsh assembly.
	   Davies, the government's Welsh Secretary, beat a challenge from
fellow lawmaker Rhodri Morgan.
	   In Edinburgh, Scotland, 500 party members elected Scottish
Secretary Donald Dewar, Britain's top official in Scotland,
unopposed.
	   If Labor wins the elections, due in May, Davies and Dewar will
be first ministers of the new assemblies, which are part of Prime
Minister Tony Blair's plan to ``modernize'' Britain by
decentralizing power.
	   The Welsh Assembly is likely to open immediately, but the far
more powerful Scottish Parliament, which will have tax-raising and
lawmaking powers, will open a year later.
	   The Welsh body will have power to distribute most of the annual
grant from the central government for health, education, transport,
arts and culture, but no power to tax the 2.7 million Welsh nor to
make laws.
	   Labor could face a fight in Scotland, one of its traditional
strongholds. In recent months there has been a surge of support for
the independence-seeking Scottish National Party, and it now runs
neck-and-neck with Labor in opinion polls.
	   In his a 25-minute acceptance speech Saturday, Dewar criticized
the Scottish Nationalists, saying they ``offer only the prospect of
a further decade of constitutional conflict which few want, which
Scotland cannot afford.''
	   Labor has warned that independence will prove costly for the 5
million Scots.
	   Scots voted 3-to-1 in a referendum last September to have their
own parliament; the Welsh voted narrowly for their own assembly in
a similar referendum the same month.

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) _ The United States came back from early
deficits to win three of the four morning matches Saturday morning
and build an 8 1-2-3 1-2 lead over Europe in the Solheim Cup.
	   Donna Andrews and Sherri Steinhauer won their match as did
Dottie Pepper and Juli Inkster and Kelly Robbins and Pat Hurst.
	   The United States led 5 1-2-2 1-2 after Friday's matches _ the
biggest lead at that stage in any of the five Solheim Cups. But, as
they had two years ago in the Solheim, the Europeans were intent on
making up ground in the second set of foursomes, or alternate-shot,
matches.
	   England's Laura Davies and Sweden's Charlotta Sorenstam won an
early point for the Europeans with a 3-2 victory over Mallon and
Brandie Burton. They never trailed in the match and clinched the
victory with a par on the par-3 16th.
	   Pepper and Inkster never led until they birdied the 15th hole in
their match with Sweden's Helen Alfredsson and Frenchwoman
Marie-Laure de Lorenzi. The Europeans won the next hole with a par
and both sides parred the 17th _ the match and the point coming
down to the closing hole.
	   Alfredsson's approach shot on the par-4 hole was in the deep
grass above the left front bunker, while Pepper's iron approach
ended up on the green but 12 meters (40 feet) away on the back
edge.
	   After de Lorenzi chipped 5 1-2 meters (18 feet) past the pin,
Inkster's lag putt came to rest a half meter (18 inches) from the
cup. Alfredsson missed the par attempt, then conceded the hole and
the 1-up match to the Americans.
	   Robbins and Hurst, 2-down through 10 holes, pulled even with a
birdie at the 14th hole and took the lead for good with a par at
the 16th. They halved the final two holes for the 1-up victory.
	   Andrews and Steinhauer pulled off a surprisingly easy victory
for the United States with a 3-2 victory over Sweden's Annika
Sorenstam and Scotland's Catriona Matthew. Sorenstam, leader in the
women's world rankings, has won one of her three matches and lost
the other two.
	   The teams were to play the second set of four-ball, or
best-ball, matches Saturday afternoon before contesting 12 singles
matches on Sunday.

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) _ Guatemala's Pacaya volcano
spewed plumes of ash Saturday, forcing the evacuation of more than
1,000 people living nearby and the suspension of all flights at the
airport in the capital.
	   The 8,421-foot (2,552-meter) volcano is located just 19 miles
(30 kms) from downtown Guatemala City, where around 1.5 million
people live.
	   The Center for Disasters Control said more than 1,000 people in
the villages of El Patrocinio, El Caracol and El Rodeo _ those
nearest the craters _ were evacuated Friday night and taken to
shelters in the town of Vicente Pacaya.
	   The Civil Aeronautics Administration announced the suspension of
flights at Guatemala City's La Aurora airport because the runways
were coated with gritty ash, inches (centimeters) thick in some
places, and the ash in the air could damage jet plane engines.
	   The last eruption May 20 sent plumes of smoke and ash up miles
(kilometers) in the air and covered the city with grit. Authorities
said the eruption since dawn Friday was not as powerful, but they
were starting to take precautions.
	   Many residents returned Saturday morning to feed their cattle
and tend their gardens, but are expected to spend the night again
in the shelters.

Iraq supports review of sanctions, but not more inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq welcomed Saturday a U.N. proposal to
review disarmament work in the country. But it again rejected a
resumption of weapons inspections, a step the U.N. Security Council
says is necessary before such a review can begin.
	   Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, an adviser to President Saddam Hussein,
said proposals for a comprehensive review addressed ``the core of
the issue'' and meet a longstanding Iraqi demand.
	   Earlier this month, the Security Council took tough action
against Iraq for freezing weapons inspections, suspending periodic
review of sanctions that have crippled Iraq's economy.
	   The action left Baghdad with little room to press for the easing
of sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   But the council agreed to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' of
sanctions after Iraq lets U.N. inspectors go back to work. Such a
move could force the council to acknowledge Iraq's progress in
ridding itself of weapons of mass destruction while generating
pressure for a lifting of sanctions.
	   Al-Saadi said such a review ``is what we have been calling for.
... This is the core of the issue. We go along with that.''
	   But he called a resumption of the inspections ``useless.''
	   ``We have been talking to them for the past seven years and
where did that get us?'' asked al-Saadi, who is widely believed to
be the father of Iraq's chemical warfare program.
	   Meanwhile, al-Saadi said test results of Iraqi warheads
suspected of carrying the deadly VX gas will prove Iraq's
contention that it never turned the substance into weapons.
	   U.N. officials have refused to characterize the findings of the
tests by French and Swiss laboratories. A French official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, has said the preliminary results were
inconclusive because not all the tests were complete.
	   But earlier, a U.S. army lab found that missile fragments had
traces of the deadly nerve agent.

Dortmund crisis deepens with 3-1 loss to Leverkusen

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The Bundesliga' youngest coach discovered once
again Saturday that halting Borussia Dortmund's downward slide
won't be easy.
	   Bayer Leverkusen trounced 32-year-old's Michael Skibbe's charges
3-1 in the Bundesliga _ the third loss in five matches this season
for the team that ruled Europe just two years ago by capturing the
Champions Cup.
	   ``We have to pull together. I'm sure we can pull out of this
deep hole and then the sun will shine again on Dortmund,'' said
Dortmund's veteran defender Juergen Kohler.
	   Striker Olaf Marschall, FC Kaiserslautern's usual hero, saved
the defending champions by scoring with five minutes left in a 1-1
draw against FC Nuremberg. His team held third in the table, just
behind surprising 1860 Munich.
	   First-place Bayern Munich plays Sunday against Hamburg, second
in the table entering the weekend.
	   Dortmund looked dispirited and disorganized in the second half
against Leverkusen after failing to cash in early on
high-percentage chances by Kohler and Bachirou Salou.
	   Leverkusen lost German national team striker Ulf Kirsten to a
deep cut six minutes into the match, but took advantage of
Dortmund's confusion with headers by Croatia's Niko Kovac in the
34th minute and Erik Meijer in the 56th.
	   Dortmund's Austrian libero Wolfgang Feiersinger, trying to
clear, aided Leverkusen's easy triumph with a 48th minute own goal.
	   German international Andreas Moeller's shot a beautiful free
kick under the crossbar in the 75th minute _ but it was Dortmund's
first goal in two matches.
	   Siddke, the Bundesliga's youngest head coach, was hired this
season without first division experience to inject new energy into
Dortmund.
	   But Siddke has come under fire for benching popular Swiss
striker Stephane Chapuisat and German national team players Thomas
Haessler and Steffen Freund.
	   Dortmund management has, until now, been sticking by their young
coach.
	   ``We need patience. We can't question everything again,'' said
President Gerd Niebaum.
	   Dortmund's lone bright spot was the return from injury of Lars
Ricken, the 22-year-old talent who was the hero of the Champions
Cup upset against Juventus Turin.
	   In other matches, Schalke pulled out of its own slump with a 2-1
away win against Bochum, 1860 deepened Stuttgart's problems with a
1-0 win and Bremen slipped out of last place with a 4-2 win against
Wolfsburg.
	   Libero Gerald Vanenburg blasted a 25-meter (25 yard) gamewinner
to lift visiting 1860 Munich past Stuttgart.
	   Stuttgart, routed in the UEFA Cup by Rotterdam four days ago,
has been ripped by a fued between management and coach Winfried
Schaeffer over the club's disappointing new players.
	   Striker Rene Eijkelkamp struck in the 52nd and 71st minutes to
hand Schalke its first away triumph this season. Bochum's Thorsten
Kracht had given his team a temporary lead in the 46th.
	   Marco Bode's two goals and one by Rade Bogdanovic, acquired from
Athletico Madrid three days ago, led Bremen past Bochum.
	   On Friday, Berlin beat Frankfurt 3-1 and Freiburg won 2-0
against Rostock.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Reacting to reports that a
hardliner is likely to be the next Bosnian Serb president, an
international official said Saturday that preliminary election
results show moderates doing well in other races.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
organized the Sept. 12-13 Bosnian elections, has not commented on
reports that the U.S.-backed incumbent, Biljana Plavsic is badly
trailing an ultranationalist rival in the race for the Bosnian Serb
presidency.
	   Despite accusations from backers of Nikola Poplasen, Plavsic's
hardline challenger, that the delay is an attempt at vote
manipulation, the OSCE says no results will be released until a
final tally is available later this week.
	   A Plavsic defeat would be a humiliating setback for U.S.-led
efforts to boost the popularity of moderates among Bosnian Serbs
and sideline the extremist supporters of indicted war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic, including Poplasen.
	   It could also call into question the entire U.S.-European
strategy, which has been to funnel millions of dollars in aid to
those who support a multi-ethnic, unified Bosnian state.
	   But on Thursday, international officials put a more promising
spin on the elections.
	   Officials familiar with the race for the Bosnian Serb presidency
have said Plavsic cannot hope to catch Poplasen. While refusing
specific comment on that race, Simon Haselock, a spokesman for
Bosnia's top international mediator, Carlos Westendorp, said
Saturday other preliminary vote counts were encouraging.
	   ``The trend that we now see is generally away from nationalist
parties,'' said Haselock.
	   Western diplomats hope that a strong showing of moderate parties
in the assembly of the Serb-held half of the country may neutralize
eventual attempts of Poplasen to move away from Bosnia's peace
accord emphasizing democracy and ethnic reconciliation.
	   A senior western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity
said Saturday moderate opposition parties were doing well on most
levels _ the Serb substate, the Muslim-Croat federation making up
the other half of Bosnia and the all-Bosnian parliament.
	   In the 83-seat Bosnian Serb assembly, opposition parties seem to
have won an additional four seats, giving them a majority of 48
seats.
	   In the 15-seat Lower House of the Bosnian joint parliament, the
pro-Plavsic coalition appears to have won at least two of five Serb
seats. Previously Serb hard-liners held all five seats.
	   In addition, the senior diplomat said, the pro-Western Serb
candidate for the three-member joint presidency, Zivko Radisic, has
a clear lead over the hardline candidate, Momcilo Krajisnik.
	   But the Western-backed Croat candidate, Kresimir Zubak
apparently has lost to Ante Jelavic, a Croat hardliner, indicating
that most Bosnian Croats still are opposed to coexistence with
Serbs and Muslims.
	   Alija Izetbegovic, the wartime leader of the Muslims and the
Muslim incumbent on the joint presidency was winning.
	   The western diplomat said a last-minute candidacy by a Muslim
for the presidency of the Bosnian Serb republic drew away tens of
thousands of Muslim votes from Plavsic and helped Poplasen.
	   Western powers now fear Poplasen would use the considerable
powers of the office _ ability to propose a Prime Minister and
eventually dissolve the parliament _ to reinforce his hard-liners.
	   Yet, they believe they will be able to work with Poplasen.
	   ``Even if Mr. Poplasen was to win against Mrs. Plavsic, given
the trend, he is unlikely to be in any particularly strong
position,'' Haselock said.
	   Post-election tensions have brought the special US envoy, Robert
Gelbard, back to Bosnia.
	   While visiting the southern town of Mostar, Gelbard indicated he
would be willing to work with whoever wins the election, pending
they respect the Dayton peace accord.
	   ``Everybody I talked to tell they are pro-Dayton; Mr. Poplasen
says he loves the Dayton agreement and now, greatest miracle of
all, Mr. Krajisnik says he loves the Dayton agreement too,''
Gelbard told reporters. ``I do not accept promises and commitments
any more, I accept facts and accomplishments.''
	   ``We are prepared to provide a serious economic support to those
who are implementing the Dayton agreement,'' Gelbard said. ``Those
who do not, are going to receive serious sanctions.''

journalists &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Drawing staunch opponents and equally
ardent supporters, a proposal to establish an international code of
ethics for journalists divided participants Saturday at a world
conference for journalists and news media experts.
	   The conference's organizers, the World Association of Press
Councils, also is proposing establishment of an institution to deal
with violations of the ethics code _ two ideas that some fear would
lead to greater press restrictions.
	   ``The only good thing that I could find to tell you (on an
international code of ethics) is that it will never exist _ and if
it did, it would never be implemented,'' said Claude Moisy,
president of UNESCO's Advisory Group on Press Freedom, adding that
a code for journalists would be wrong in principle, impossible to
formulate and impossible to enforce.
	   The proposals are being championed by the previously
little-known World Association of Press Councils. Founded in 1992,
the association has 16 councils in nations around the world to deal
with local complaints about the news media.
	   Some more prominent industry groups, including the American
Society of Newspaper Editors, have strongly objected to the
proposals.
	   An international code could become ``an instrument for
government and intergovernmental authorities against the press,''
according to Ronald Koven of the World Press Freedom Committee.
``It's an open invitation for government and official bodies to
turn a code into law. And ethics, by definition, are not law.''
	   Backers say the ethics code would be a voluntary one, to which
press councils or similar national institutions could choose to
observe.
	   ``It would be something for journalists to aspire to,'' said
Chris Conybeare of the Honolulu Press Council _ one few press
councils in the U.S. _ insisting that the code, which he preferred
to call a blueprint, should not come from top-down but ``try to use
the collective experience of journalists.''
	   To the former director of the International Press Institute,
Peter Galliner, establishing a code by and for journalists could
help preserve the profession from more press laws.
	   ``If the press can't get itself into reasonable order, the
pressure to introduce press legislation will increase,'' Galliner
told The Associated Press.
	   The debate's keynote speaker, Claude-Jean Bertrand of the
Paris-based French Press Institute, said a code would increase
ethical awareness, generate solidarity within the profession and
improve its reputation.
	   But a code is not enough, said Bertrand. ``What is needed are
voluntary 'media accountability systems','' set up by
professionals, media managers, media users or experts in media.
	   On Sunday, delegates are scheduled to discuss the creation of an
international monitoring body that would deal with press-related
complaints.

	   CHIAVARI, Italy (AP)_ On the edge of the sea, under a
crystalline blue sky, Pope John Paul II on Saturday urged his flock
to spread a message of love and faith.
	   About 70,000 were present for the pope's open-air Mass in the
little resort town of Chiavari, south of Genoa.
	   Although he is stooped with age and walks slowly, the
78-year-old pontiff was in fine form, pink-cheeked, bright-eyed and
clearly enjoying close contact with the faithful.
	   At a meeting Friday night with nuns, priests and seminarians in
the town cathedral, he gave a jaunty wave with his cane and beamed.
The nuns beamed warmly back, kissing his hand as he passed through
the crowd.
	   Chiavari spared no effort in welcoming the pope.
	   A brilliant, crackling fireworks display in his honor brightened
the night sky Friday. Thousands of people lined the streets waving
papal flags whenever the popemobile passed by. Local artisans
labored for months to build the turquoise, blue and white altar on
the bay where he celebrated Mass from an elaborate crimson and gold
throne.
	   In his homily, John Paul spoke of the importance of grassroots
Christianity and of reinvigorating the faith. Everyone, he said, is
Christ's disciple.
	   ``In the community, this means to carry each others' burdens, to
share, to collaborate, to feel responsible for one another,'' he
said.
	   The pontiff was in the second day of a three-day pastoral trip
to northern Italy. He was to return to Rome on Sunday.
	   On Saturday afternoon, he flew by helicopter to Brescia, a
prosperous city of 200,000 near Lake Garda at the feet of the
Italian Alps.
	   Before thousands of admirers, he saluted Brescia's vibrant
history, noting the lovely square around him, where a soaring
Baroque cathedral rubs shoulders with chunky medieval civic
buildings.
	   The structures, he said, ``evoke your noble past and rich
history, but more than anything, they are witness to the duty of
collaboration between civil society and religion.''
	   On Sunday, the pontiff will beatify a local son who devoted
himself to promoting the Roman Catholic faith, Giuseppe Tovini.
Beatification is a step toward sainthood.
	   A lawyer and father of 10 children, Tovini founded Catholic
schools, a Catholic newspaper, banks and charities. He died in
1897, the same year another local son, Pope Paul VI, was born.
	   John Paul's predecessor, Paul was pontiff from 1963 to 1978 and
presided over the historic reforms of the Second Vatican Council.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A top international delegation criticized
both the government and opposition Saturday for their part in
rioting this week that threatened to topple the elected leadership.
	   Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe blamed ex-President Sali Berisha for the unrest.
	   Berisha remained defiant. A high-level meeting of his Democratic
Party on Saturday rejected government demands that it recognize its
authority and condemn the violence unleashed nearly a week ago by
Berisha supporters as a condition for dialogue.
	   The meeting also pledged to continue ``massive protest'' against
the government.

	   CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) - Namibia qualified for next year's
Rugby World Cup Saturday by pounding Zimbabwe 39-14 in a key
qualifying match.
	   Morocco beat the Ivory Coast 6-3 to finish second in the
round-robin four-nation qualifying competition, and so progresses
to March's repechage qualifying tournament, a seven-team event
involving all five geographical regions from which two teams will
qualify.
	   The 20-nation finals will take place in September and October
1999 in Britain, Ireland and France.
	   Namibia, which won all three of its matches in Morocco, had
little problem beating Zimbabwe, with Tannie Augustine, Sarel van
Rensburg, Johan Nienaber, Attie Samelson, Lukas Holtz Hausen and
Lean Vandyk all scoring tries.
	   The win means that it will compete in the World Cup finals for
the first time.
	   Morocco, which ended up with two wins and one defeat, needed two
penalties by Chahid Karim to overcome Ivory Coast.

Israel heads into holiday on high alert; envoy's visit ending
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Hamas rally in Hebron. Time uncertain
on Ross-Arafat, Ross-Netanyahu meetings. &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. envoy Dennis Ross on Saturday was wrapping
up his latest effort _ fruitless so far _ to end the 18-month
deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts.
	   And, as so often happens in Israel, tension and fear shadowed
what is supposed to be a festive occasion _ the Jewish New Year
that begins at sundown Sunday.
	   In the West Bank, its border with Israel sealed off along with
that of the Gaza Strip, thousands of supporters of the radical
Islamic group Hamas staged a march, burning U.S. and Israeli flags
and screaming, ``Revenge, revenge!''
	   Barring a last-minute breakthrough in separate talks later
Saturday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ross appeared poised to head back to
the United States empty-handed after an 11-day visit to the region.
	   In the American-brokered talks, the two sides have been trying
to reach agreement on a long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and on revised terms of a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Ross' departure was scheduled for early Sunday, only hours
before the start of the two-day Rosh Hashana holiday. Commentators
agreed that as the year wound down, things looked inauspicious
indeed on the peace front.
	   ``If it's time for New Year well-wishing, let there be some
realism,'' commentator B. Michael wrote in the Friday's Yediot
Ahronot newspaper. ``The chance that the next year will be a good
one is pretty slim.''
	   Israelis mark Rosh Hashana with special prayers and readings,
and the blowing of a ram's horn, or shofar. A traditional treat is
apple slices dipped in honey, symbolizing hopes that the coming
year will be sweet.
	   But bitterness was the overriding theme. The Palestinian
Cabinet, in a statement issued Saturday, blamed Israel for the
failure to reach an accord during Ross' visit.
	   ``The mission did not achieve the progress anticipated due to
Israeli procrastination in ... acceptance of the American
Initiative,'' said the Cabinet, which met late Friday.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, more than 3,000 supporters of
the radical Islamic group Hamas rallied Saturday. Palestinian
police did not interfere with the march, staged in a
Palestinian-controlled area.
	   ``The blood of our murdered ones will not be wasted!'' said
Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin, addressing the demonstrators
by telephone hookup from Gaza.
	   Hamas has vowed to avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers Imad
and Adel Awadallah, top fugitives who were shot dead by Israeli
troops in a bloody raid on their West Bank hideout.
	   Near the West Bank town of Ramallah, Israeli troops and
Palestinian demonstrators fought small-scale skirmishes Saturday.
	   About 20 youths on a highway overpass outside Ramallah tore down

flung chunks of stone into a passing army jeep. Soldiers fired tear
gas to disperse the youths. No injuries were reported.
	   Later, near an Israeli checkpoint south of Ramallah,
Palestinians threw stones at soldiers and burned tires. The
official Voice of Palestine radio said Israeli troops encircled the
area.
	   Arafat, meanwhile, accused the Israeli government of condoning
violence by Jewish settlers against Palestinians, and said such
attacks were destroying prospects for peace. A Palestinian youth
was shot dead Thursday by a Jewish settler near the West Bank
village of Beitunia.

stoned. Palestinians said the shooting was unprovoked. A magistrate
ordered the settler held over until at least Sunday.

Israel heads into holiday on high alert; envoy's visit ending
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ross arriving in Gaza for meeting with Arafat,

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An American mediator on Saturday was wrapping
up his latest effort _ fruitless so far _ to end the 18-month
deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts.
	   And as so often happens in Israel, tension and fear shadowed
what was supposed to be a festive occasion _ the Jewish New Year's
holiday, beginning at sundown Sunday.
	   In the West Bank _ whose border with Israel was sealed off,
along with that of the Gaza Strip _ thousands of supporters of the
radical Islamic group Hamas staged a march, burning U.S. and
Israeli flags and screaming, ``Revenge, revenge!''
	   Barring a last-minute breakthrough in separate talks later
Saturday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. envoy Dennis Ross appeared poised
to head back to the United States empty-handed after an 11-day
visit to the region.
	   Arriving in Gaza for his meeting with Arafat, Ross made no
comment to reporters.
	   In the American-brokered talks, the two sides have been trying
to reach agreement on a long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and on revised terms of a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Ross' departure was scheduled early Sunday, only hours before
the start of the two-day Rosh Hashana holiday. Commentators agreed
that as the year wound down, things looked inauspicious indeed on
the peace front.
	   ``If it's time for New Year well-wishing, let there be some
realism,'' commentator B. Michael wrote in Friday's editions of the
Yediot Ahronot daily newspaper. ``The chance that the next year
will be a good one is pretty slim.''
	   Israelis mark Rosh Hashana with special prayers and readings,
and the blowing of a ram's horn, or shofar. A traditional treat is
apple slices dipped in honey, symbolizing hopes that the coming
year will be sweet.
	   But bitterness was the overriding theme. The Palestinian
Cabinet, in a statement issued Saturday, blamed Israel for the
failure to reach an accord during Ross' visit.
	   ``The mission did not achieve the progress anticipated due to
Israeli procrastination in ... acceptance of the American
Initiative,'' said the Cabinet, which met late Friday.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, more than 3,000 supporters of
the radical Islamic group Hamas rallied Saturday, waving green
Hamas flags and singing nationalistic songs. Palestinian police did
not interfere with the march, staged in a Palestinian-controlled
area.
	   ``The blood of our murdered ones will not be wasted!'' said
Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin, addressing the demonstrators
by telephone hookup from Gaza.
	   Hamas has vowed to avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers Imad
and Adel Awadallah, top fugitives who were shot dead by Israeli
troops in a bloody raid on their West Bank hideout.
	   Near the West Bank town of Ramallah, Israeli troops and
Palestinian demonstrators fought small-scale skirmishes over
several hours on Saturday. About 20 youths on a highway overpass
outside Ramallah tore down protective fencing meant to keep them
from stoning motorists.
	   ``Allahu akbar _ God is great!'' they shouted as they flung
chunks of stone that slammed into a passing army jeep. Soldiers
jumped out, guns at the ready, and fired tear gas to disperse the
youths. No injuries were reported.
	   Later, near an Israeli checkpoint south of Ramallah,
Palestinians threw stones at soldiers and burned tires, sending
plumes of black smoke into the air. The official Voice of Palestine
radio said Israeli troops encircled the area.
	   Arafat, meanwhile, accused the Israeli government of condoning
violence by Jewish settlers against Palestinians, and said such
attacks were destroying prospects for peace. A Palestinian youth
was shot dead Thursday by a Jewish settler near the West Bank
village of Beitunia.
	   The settler said he acted in self-defense after his car was
stoned; Palestinians said the shooting was unprovoked. A magistrate
ordered the settler held over until at least Sunday.
	   ``These crimes happen, and we haven't heard any denunciation of
such acts by the Israeli government,'' Arafat told his Cabinet.
	   At their meeting late Friday, Palestinian ministers discussed
preparations for a unilateral declaration of statehood in May,
saying Palestinian emissaries would fan out to ``friendly
countries'' to seek pledges of recognition for any new state.
	   Earlier in the day, Palestinian parliament speaker Ahmed Qureia
had told The Associated Press the Palestinians might delay their
declaration if there were sufficient progress in negotiations with
Israel.
	   Netanyahu has hinted he would respond to any unilateral
proclamation of Palestinian statehood by annexing parts of the West
Bank, a move that would likely bring an explosion of violence.

Police outnumber neo-Nazis at campaign rally in east Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES number of arrests, turnout; more details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROSTOCK, Germany (AP) _ At least 114 people were arrested and
one police officer injured Saturday in the Baltic port city of
Rostock, where an extreme-right party held its final campaign rally
a week before national and state elections.
	   Most of the arrests involved left-wing extremists who clashed
with police keeping them away from the National Party of Germany
rally, said state Interior Minister Armin Jaeger. Some will face
charges of causing bodily harm and disturbing the peace.
	   Some neo-Nazis also were taken into custody on charges such as
displaying banned symbols, he said. Exact numbers were not
available.
	   Police said about 3,000 supporters of the anti-foreigner
National Party had turned out for the rally, less than the 5,000
party officials had predicted.
	   Rostock Mayor Arno Poeker, who had sought to ban the rally, said
between 8,000 and 10,000 people turned out for a
counter-demonstration and ``peace festival.''
	   Most of the arrests occurred when about 400 left-wing anarchists
tried to break through police lines toward the National Party
rally, Jaeger said. One police officer was slightly injured by a
projectile thrown by the leftists.
	   About 6,000 police officers from across Germany were deployed to
keep the two sides separate and prevent violence _ the biggest
deployment ever in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, an economically
depressed state in former communist east Germany.
	   Officers stopped cars at roadblocks for checks and helicopters
flew overhead during the rally. Both sides complained that their
supporters couldn't reach the rallies because of the controls.
	   The city of Rostock initially banned the National Party rally,
its last major campaign event in the state before Sept. 27
elections both for the federal and state parliaments.
	   But the courts overturned the ban after the party agreed to move
the site away from the part of Rostock that was the scene of an
anti-foreigner arson attack and skinhead rioting in 1992.

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bavarian police have arrested a man
described as a close associate of international terrorist Osama bin
Laden, the state Justice Ministry said Saturtoday.
	   Officials did not release the identity of the man. They said he
was arrested Wednesday afternoon near Munich on a tip from Interpol
officials in Washington. The ministry said it would confirm the
man's identity this week and determine what he was doing in
Germany.
	   In a report Saturday, The Washington Post identified the suspect
as Mamduh Mahmud Salim and described him as a top lieutenant and
weapons procurer for bin Laden.
	   In Tanzania, meanwhile, a newspaper reported that two suspects
held there in connection with the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Dar es Salaam will be charged in a local court next
week. They were expected to be charged of murder, conspiracy and
bombing. Omar Mahita, head of the Tanzanian police, would only
identify the two as a Tanzanian from Zanzibar and a foreigner.
	   Mahita told the Swahili-language daily Mtanzania that some
others still being detained will be released soon. ``There is no
point to continue holding those (whom) we could not prove their
involvement in the incident,'' Mahita was quoted as saying. ``We
shall consult with our FBI partners to establish those we shall
release.''
	   The Post, in its report on the suspect in custody in Germany,
said U.S. officials have filed charges against Salim in New York.
It also said a sealed warrant seeking Salim's arrest was issued
recently in Manhattan.
	   The newspaper's sources said Salim was a member of al Qaida, an
international terrorist organization allegedly headed by bin Laden.
	   The FBI and CIA assisted in Salim's arrest, the Post said.
	   On Thursday, the U.S. government offered a dlrs 2 million reward
for a fugitive charged with killing 12 Americans by helping plan
the bombing in Nairobi, Kenya, which occured almost simultaneously
with the Dar es Salaam attack. The two embassy bombings killed a
total of 258 people and injured thousands.
	   The fugitive, identified as Haroun Fazil, was the third suspect
publicly charged in the bombings.

Seven arrested protesting launch of nuclear sub
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 2 and 3, with 12 arrested &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BARROW-IN-FURNESS, England (AP) _ Britain launched its fourth _
and probably last _ Trident nuclear submarine Saturday, to protests
from anti-nuclear campaigners.
	   In the early hours of Saturday, police arrested 12 people, some
of whom had climbed the perimeter fence of the VSEL shipyard in
Barrow-in-Furness, northwest England, where the 16,000-ton HMS
Vengeance was awaiting launch, said Inspector Ian Robertshaw of
Cumbria police.
	   Police said six were arrested inside the site and six outside.
They were held for questioning.
	   Later, more than 200 other protesters from the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament jeered, banged drums and waved placards from a
bridge overlooking the shipyard as Sandra Robertson, wife of
Defense Secretary George Robertson, officially launched the HMS
Vengeance.
	   The 500 million-pound (dlrs-800 million) vessel, which can carry
up to 16 nuclear missiles, is likely to be the last nuclear
submarine in Britain's fleet.
	   Speaking at the shipyard, Robertson said Saturday the new
submarine will enable the government ``to maintain a minimum, but
credible and effective nuclear deterrent.''
	   ``It is realistic in that we recognize that we must retain
strong defences against the uncertain and changing challenges of
the post-Cold War world,'' he said.
	   But he added that Britain remains committed to nuclear
disarmament.
	   ``We will continue to press with greater urgency than has been
seen for years for multilateral negotiations towards mutual,
balanced and verifiable reductions in such weapons,'' he said.

	   Details of Saturday English Premier League games.
 &UR; Coventry 1, Newcastle 5 (1-3) &QC; 
	   The fun's back in soccer at Newcastle with a wide-open style of
play that was missing under disposed coach Kenny Dalglish. The win
makes it three straight for Newcastle under Ruud Gullit and
Shearer, with two goals, now has five in three games after being
shut out in 10 games. Greece's Nikolas Dabizas, Stephen Glass and
Gary Speed also scored for Newcastle with Coventry's lone goal from
Noel Whelan in the fourth.
 &UR; Derby 2, Leicester 0 (1-0) &QC; 
	   The victory made up for a sharp 4-0 defeated last season against
Leicester as German Stefan Schnoor scored in the 34th and Costa
Rican Paulo Wanchope netted a goal in the 51st. The Derby defense
held Leicester striker Emile Heskey in check.
 &UR; Leeds 0, Aston Villa 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   This was a battle between two of the league's top defenses. Any
wonder it ended scoreless? Villa kept the league leadership and
coach John Gregory was still celebrating a two-year extension to
his contract signed Friday. For Leeds, it was a fifth league
shutout in the opening six league matches _ a club record. Leeds
also shut out Portugal's Maritimo in last week's UEFA Cup.
 &UR; Liverpool 3, Charlton 3 (1-1) &QC; 
	   Liverpool again missed the injured Paul Ince at midfield as
Charlton rallied with a late goal in the 83rd by Steve Jones to
tie. Charlton took a 1-0 lead in the 24th from Richard Rufus, but
Robbie Fowler _ back starting after a long injury battle _ made it
1-1 in the 33rd on a penalty. Clive Mendoca gave Charlton a 2-1
lead but Patrick Berger tied in the 67th and then Fowler game
Liverpool a short-lived lead in the 82nd.
 &UR; Middlesbrough 2, Everton 2 (2-0) &QC; 
	   Colombian Hamilton Ricard gave Middlesbrough a 2-0 lead on goals
in the 27th and 35th, but Everton rallied for the draw on a penalty
in the 47th by 18-year-old Michael Ball and goal in the 48th by
John Collins. Ricard now has a league-leading six goals, five in
league play and the other in the League Cup.
 &UR; Nottingham Forest 0, West Ham 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Another scoreless draw on a lackluster afternoon in Nottingham.
The draw ended Forest's two game losing streak as the struggle to
find a replacement for Pierre van Hooijdonk continues. West Ham
survived without eight key injured players.
 &UR; Southampton 1, Tottenham 1 (0-1) &QC; 
	   Ruel Fox gave Tottenham a 1-0 lead in the 25th, but Matt Le
Tissier got the tying goal in the 64th on a shot from 15 meters
(yards) that got behind stand-in goalkeeper Hans Segers. Segers was
cleared of match-fixing charges last year by an English court in a
case involving former Liverpool and Southampton 'keeper Bruce
Grobbelaar. It was Southampton's first point of the season.
 &UR; Wimbledon 2, Sheffield Wednesday 1 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Coach Danny Wilson benched Italian Paolo Di Canio for openly
criticizing the new coach after a 1-0 loss last week in the League
Cup to third-division Cambridge. Now maybe Wilson wishes he hadn't
made the move. With Wimbledon leading 2-0 on goals by Jason Euell
in the first and 50th, Di Canio scored as a second-half substitute
in the 84th. What might have been if he'd played the whole match?

Hingis beats Martinez to give Swiss 1-1 tie with Spain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with second singles; Stands as 3rd Ld-Writethru to
Sports-Tennis-Fed Cup Final to European lines to eliminate
reference to Manhattan. &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ Martina Hingis defeated Conchita
Martinez in straight sets Saturday and rallied Switzerland to a 1-1
tie with Spain after the first day's play of the Fed Cup Final.
	   About 12,000 frantic spectators packing the Palexpo watched in
relief as Hingis won 6-4, 6-4 to even the best-of-5 tie after
French Open champ Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario took advantage of a
struggling Patty Schnyder and prevailed 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 in 2-hours,
25-minute match.
	   ``It felt great today,'' said Hingis, winner of four Grand
Slams. ``I had a solid win and an enormous crowd was cheering for
me.
	   ``Normally the crowds are just as big, but being world No. 1 the
crowd is usually against mend Martinez traded breaks twice in the back-and-forth
first set before the Swiss capitalized on a second break point in
the 10th game to win the set.
	   In the second set, Hingis broke to lead 4-2 and had a double
break, double set point at 5-3 but lost the next four points _ and
then her temper _ to allow Martinez to get back on serve.
	   Hingis stormed back in the next game, breaking the Spaniard at
love to take the match.
	   ``I was upset I lost my serve when I was up two match points,''
Hingis said. ``I made stupid shots and played a bad game.
	   ``But I wanted to get off the court so I could be ready for
tomorrow.''
	   Hingis, who has a 7-1 record over Sanchez-Vicario including
victories in their last six meetings, most recently defeated the
Spaniard just over a week ago in the U.S. Open semifinals. She
eliminated her in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon.
	   Hingis, however, doesn't plan on lowering her guard.
	   ``Arantxa is a tough opponent,'' Hingis said. ``She's a tough
fighter and she'll run on the court until she dies.
	   ``You never know until the last point what is going to happen
even if you're leading by a lot.''
	   Supported by Spain's own little contingent of fans, clacking
castagnets and tambourines, Sanchez-Vicario dominated the first set
of her match against Schynder, the Swiss teen-ager often aiding in
her own defeat.
	   The Swiss teen-ager double-faulted on break point to give
Sanchez-Vicario a 3-1 advantage, then let the Spaniard convert a
second break point to go ahead 5-1.
	   It was only when she was broken on her opening serve in the
second set that Schnyder finally came to life. She began to display
the form which earned her five tournament titles this season and
lifted her from 26th to ninth in the WTA Tour rankings.
	   Spurred by the crowd, Schnyder immediately broke back and then
held to even the score 2-2.
	   At 4-3, Schnyder again broke Sanchez-Vicario and held to even
the match.
	   Maintaining the momentum, the 19-year-old Swiss broke
Sanchez-Vicario to open the final set and send the crowd into a
frenzy.
	   But drawing on the experience and determination which have
helped her lead Spain to four Fed Cup titles, Sanchez-Vicario
settled herself, and broke twice to lead 4-2.
	   Schnyder squandered three break points to get back on serve,
allowing Sanchez-Vicario to consolidate her lead at 5-2 and easily
win the match.
	   ``It was important to win the first point for Spain,'' said
Sanchez-Vicario. ``All I can do now is try to get points for my
country in my next matches.''

<TEXT>
	   EL SAUZAL, Mexico (AP) _ The killers arrived in three light
trucks before dawn, dressed all in black and carrying automatic
rifles.
	   They worked quickly, professionally. And when they were done, 18
men, women and children from one extended family lay dead in
bleeding mounds beside a patio wall at the ranch by the sea in
northern Mexico.
	   ``The children said that it lasted an eternity _ an hour,'' said
state Cmdr. Felipe Perez Cruz, quoting testimony of a 12-year-old
boy and 15-year-old girl who survived the Thursday morning massacre
linked to drugs. ``It was probably 15 or 20 minutes.''
	   Statements by investigators and a tour of the blood-stained
compound a day after the killings provide signs of a well-organized
team carrying out orders to kill an alleged marijuana trafficker
and his relatives for some unknown crime against rivals in the drug
trade.
	   After driving across a dusty plain, at least nine or 10 gunmen
got out at the ranch this suburb of the Baja California resort of
Ensenada. The killers broke into three teams, each assigned to one
of the family's three houses. ``They must have known the family,''
Perez Cruz said.
	   First hit was the Tovar family household, headed by a sister of
alleged trafficker Fermin Castro _ apparently the main target. The
Tovar family was the only part of the Castro clan not believed to
have been involved with drugs, investigators say.
	   One team went through a downstairs window in the Tovar house, in
the middle of the compound. Micaria Jaime Tovar, eight months
pregnant with her second child, her 1-year-old son Cesar and four
other family members were taken to the patio, probably at gunpoint.
	   A second team entered the house of Francisco Flores Altamirano,
Castro's brother-in-law and alleged lieutenant in marijuana
smuggling. The last team went after Castro, who local media say was
known as ``The Iceman.''
	   While the first and second teams gathered half-dressed couples
and pajama-clad children in a corner of the patio in the early
morning chill, the third team raced up an exterior staircase and
battered or shot in a third-story doorway in Castro's house.
	   Castro was caught in his second-story bedroom, where he was
beaten and possibly tortured. Two days later, Castro lay in a coma
with gunshot wounds to the head, barely alive.
	   It was unclear whether he was taken to the patio, where the
victims were closely packed together against a cinderblock wall.
His wife and 2-year-old son were among those killed there.
	   Normally, the story would have stopped with the gunmen issuing a
warning that would have been respected under a code of silence so
strict that ``you can't get a word out of these people,'' federal
investigator Jose Luis Chavez says.
	   Traffickers' relatives _ and especially children _ are rarely
targeted in drug-related paybacks in Mexico.
	   But something was different this time.
	   Perez Cruz said the killers may have been in an ``altered
state'' _ drugged or emotionally upset. Or the killers may have
been following little-used rules about punishment for those who
switch sides in drug gangs, local media say.
	   Still closely huddled together, toddlers beside their mothers,
they were ordered to get down on the cold concrete. Neighbors woke
when bursts of automatic weapons fire shattered the early morning
quiet at 4:15 a.m.
	   ``There weren't finished off one by one. They simply sprayed
them all with bullets,'' Perez Cruz said. Eighty spent shells, an
average of four bullets per victim, were later found.
	   Mario Alberto Flores, 12, miraculously survived. Losing blood,
he wandered about Castro's home until he was found by his cousin,
Viviana Flores, 15, who was never discovered by the killers. The
girl, six months pregnant, had hidden between a table and an
armoire.
	   There were no signs of struggle in the houses or on the patio.
Apparently no weapons were kept at the compound.
	   Inside Castro's house, a pile of video tapes lay on the living
room floor, some clothes on the back of a couch. Washing hung
limply on clotheslines outside.
	   Ten people have been detained in the border town of Tecate, east
of Tijuana, for questioning after the discovery of guns similar to
those used in the killings, authorities said Friday. But the
detainees have not been formally arrested.
	   The crime scene offers no clues for the killers' motive. The
killings remain as mysterious as the lone trail of bloody
footprints leading away from Castro's house.
	   A bare, right foot imprinted in blood starts to flee, wavers and
finally disappears just steps from the back door.

Iraq says Kuwait will pay `heavy price' for hostile stand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq warned Kuwait Saturday that it will
pay ``a heavy price'' for its anti-Iraq activities.
	   The threat came in a front-page editorial in Babil, a newspaper
owned by President Saddam Hussein's eldest son, Odai.
	   Kuwait's rulers ``once again throw themselves into the fire of a
conflict. They do not seem to realize its magnitude and the losses
they are going to pay for it,'' the paper said.
	   They ``will find themselves ... one day without American
protection ... and they will pay a heavy price that will be beyond
imagination,'' warned the paper, Iraq's most influential.
	   Babil accused Kuwait of trying to scuttle efforts by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to find a solution for Iraq's current
crisis with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Iraq has suspended cooperation with the inspectors and says it
will only resume it when they acknowledge the progress it has made
in eliminating its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, leading to the Gulf War. The United
Nations imposed sweeping sanctions after the invasion.

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Government troops captured the
residence of former warlord Roosevelt Johnson on Saturday during
more than half-a-day of pitched fighting with Johnson's ex-rebel
supporters.
	   The bodies of at least six people lay in the streets of downtown
Monrovia and dozens of wounded civilians poured into local
hospitals and clinics. Streets were nearly deserted as frightened
residents barred the doors and to their homes.
	   Machine-gun fire, exploding hand grenades and mortars erupted
overnight Friday when President Charles Taylor's personal security
unit surrounded Johnson's spacious apartment complex on the
southern edge of the city center.
	   Johnson reportedly fled his residence as throngs of his
supporters stripped half-naked and opened fire on the government
soldiers. Battles continued Saturday as Taylor's forces carried out
house-to-house searches for Johnson's followers.
	   Taylor said his soldiers had merely been trying to seize a
building that he said was illegally occupied by Johnson's ethnic
Krahn ex-rebels.
	   The president blamed the fighting on Johnson's men, saying an
arrest warrant had been issued for the former rebel leader, who he
said was hiding in the U.S. embassy. The claim could not be
independently confirmed and U.S. officials in Monrovia were
unreachable.
	   ``Enough is enough,'' Taylor told reporters. ``We will not react
kindly to any attempt by the U.S. government to evacuate those
individuals from Liberia.''
	   Several government soldiers were wounded because they had not
been expecting a battle. Fighting subsided to sporadic gunshots by
Saturday evening, as government troops patrolled the city streets
shouting jubilantly.

Hurricane watches posted in eastern Caribbean as Georges nears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new speed and location of storm; ADDS new quotes;
EDITS throughout. As of 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), hurricane located
15.4 north latitude and 53.5 west longitude, about 510 miles (815

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Residents of small islands in
the eastern Caribbean stocked up on food and water as Hurricane
Georges grew bigger, stronger and closer Saturday.
	   At 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) Saturday, the National Hurricane Center
in Miami said Georges was centered at 15.4 north latitude and 53.5
west longitude, about 510 miles (815 kilometers) east of the Lesser
Antilles.
	   A U.S. Air Force reconnaissance plane that flew into Georges at
about 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT) Saturday confirmed what forecasters had
gleaned from satellite images: Georges is a dangerous hurricane
with 125 mph (200 kph) sustained winds and may strengthen further.
	   Georges grew bigger as well as stronger Saturday, with hurricane
force winds extending 45 miles (70 kilometers) from the center.
	   Georges' sustained winds make it a category 3 hurricane, which
is capable of causing extensive damage.
	   Residents of the small, eastern Caribbean islands were taking
the strengthening storm seriously.
	   Under sunny skies in Dominica, the usually busy Saturday morning
markets were more active than usual as residents stocked up on
necessities while fishermen hauled their boats from the water.
	   In the neighboring French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe,
forecasters began warning residents Friday night to take Georges
seriously.
	   ``This is a hurricane big enough that people should remain very
vigilant and should not think that our island will be completely
spared by Georges,'' warned forecaster Danielle Decan on Radio
Caraibes in Martinique.
	   Jean-Jack Queyranne, the French minister of overseas
departments, sent 40 public service officers each to Martinique and
Guadeloupe to prepare for the hurricane.
	   The Hurricane Center said Georges was moving west-northwest at
18 mph (29 kph), slightly slower than its progress Friday.
	   With no major weather systems in its path, there was nothing to
turn Georges from its course toward the islands _ which could be
hit sometime Sunday morning.
	   ``Right now, it looks like it's going to stay on its westward
movement,'' said Brian Mahar, forecaster at the Hurricane Center.
``There's nothing major out there ahead of it.''
	   Hurricane watches extended around the northeastern rim of the
Caribbean from St. Lucia in the south to the U.S. Virgin Islands in
the north, and warnings were expected later Saturday for the
easternmost islands.
	   ``Things have been put in place for the implementation of action
if and when a hurricane warning is put into effect,'' announced
Dominica Prime Minister Edison G. James after a meeting of the
National Emergency Planning Organization on Saturday.

Iraq supports review of sanctions, but not more inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq welcomed a U.N. proposal to review
economic sanctions, but again on Saturday refused to resume weapons
inspections, a necessary step before any review can begin.
	   Earlier this month, the U.N. Security Council took tough action
against Iraq for freezing weapons inspections, suspending periodic
review of sanctions that have crippled Iraq's economy. The action
left Iraq with little room to press for the easing of sanctions
imposed after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   But council agreed Sept. 10 to conduct a ``comprehensive
review'' of sanctions after Iraq lets U.N. inspectors go back to
work. Such a move could force the council to acknowledge Iraq's
progress in ridding itself of weapons of mass destruction while
generating pressure to lift sanctions.
	   Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, an adviser to President Saddam Hussein,
said Saturday that proposals for a comprehensive review addressed
``the core of the issue'' and meet a longstanding Iraqi demand.
	   Al-Saadi said such a review ``is what we have been calling for.
... This is the core of the issue. We go along with that.''
	   But he called a resumption of the inspections ``useless.''
	   ``We have been talking to them for the past seven years and
where did that get us?'' asked al-Saadi, who is widely believed to
be the father of Iraq's chemical warfare program.
	   Meanwhile, al-Saadi said test results of Iraqi warheads
suspected of carrying the deadly VX gas will prove Iraq's
contention that it never turned the substance into weapons.
	   U.N. officials have refused to characterize the findings of the
tests by French and Swiss laboratories. A French official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, has said the preliminary results were
inconclusive because not all the tests were complete.
	   But earlier, a U.S. army lab found that missile fragments had
traces of the deadly nerve agent.

All-Spanish final at Bournemouth: Mantilla vs. Costa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) _ Defending champion Felix Mantilla
and '96 champion Albert Costa _ both of Spain _ will battle it out
again for this year's clay-court title at the Samsung Open.
	   The two Spaniards, showing again that Iberia produces the best
players in the world on clay, advanced in Saturday's semifinals as
No. 3 seed Mantilla beat Germany's Mark-Kevin Goellner 6-4, 6-2 and
No. 2 Costa won over Italy's Vincenzo Santopadre 7-6 (7-3), 6-0.
	   Spain's Alberto Berasategui was seeded No. 1 but lost in the
quarterfinals Friday to Goellner.
	   Mantilla, trying to win his first ATP title since winning this
tournament a year ago, served five straight aces against Goellner.
	   ``It was unbelievable, and on a clay court as well,'' Mantilla
said. ``When I had served three aces to make it 40-love, I thought
I would try to do one more. But I never thought it would happen.
	   ``I tried and it worked. I have never done anything like that
before in my six-year career. I was amazed.''
	   It will be tough for Mantilla against Costa. Costa has won all
four previous head-to-head matches, three of which were on clay.
	   ``I am going to try and be consistent like I have been all
week,'' Mantilla said. ```We will see what happens. I will just
give it my best.''

Preliminary results show opposition parties doing well
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Reacting to reports that a
hard-liner is likely to be the next Bosnian Serb president, an
international official said Saturday that preliminary election
results show moderates doing well in other races.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
organized the Sept. 12-13 Bosnian elections, has not commented on
reports that the U.S.-backed incumbent, Biljana Plavsic is trailing
a hard-line rival in the race for the Bosnian Serb presidency.
	   Despite accusations from backers of Nikola Poplasen, Plavsic's
hard-line challenger, that the delay is an attempt at vote
manipulation, the OSCE says no results will be released until a
final tally is available later this week.
	   A Plavsic defeat would be a humiliating setback for U.S.-led
efforts to boost the popularity of moderates among Bosnian Serbs
and sideline the extremist supporters of indicted war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic, including Poplasen.
	   It could also call into question the entire U.S.-European
strategy, which has been to funnel millions of dollars in aid to
those who support a multiethnic, unified Bosnian state.
	   But on Thursday, international officials put a more promising
spin on the elections.
	   Officials familiar with the race for the Bosnian Serb presidency
have said Plavsic cannot hope to catch Poplasen. While refusing
specific comment on that race, Simon Haselock, a spokesman for
Bosnia's top international mediator, Carlos Westendorp, said
Saturday other preliminary vote counts were encouraging.
	   ``The trend that we now see is generally away from nationalist
parties,'' said Haselock.
	   Western diplomats hope that a strong showing of moderate parties
in the assembly of the Serb-held half of the country may neutralize
eventual attempts of Poplasen to move away from Bosnia's peace
accord emphasizing democracy and ethnic reconciliation.
	   A senior western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity
said Saturday moderate opposition parties were doing well on most
levels _ the Serb substate, the Muslim-Croat federation making up
the other half of Bosnia and the all-Bosnian parliament.
	   In the 83-seat Bosnian Serb assembly, opposition parties seem to
have won an additional four seats, giving them a majority of 48
seats.
	   In the 15-seat Lower House of the Bosnian joint parliament, the
pro-Plavsic coalition appears to have won at least two of five Serb
seats. Previously Serb hard-liners held all five seats.
	   In addition, the senior diplomat said, the pro-Western Serb
candidate for the three-member joint presidency, Zivko Radisic, has
a clear lead over the hard-line candidate, Momcilo Krajisnik.
	   But the Western-backed Croat candidate, Kresimir Zubak
apparently has lost to Ante Jelavic, a Croat hard-liner, indicating
that most Bosnian Croats still are opposed to coexistence with
Serbs and Muslims.
	   Alija Izetbegovic, the wartime leader of the Muslims and the
Muslim incumbent on the joint presidency was winning.
	   The western diplomat said a last-minute candidacy by a Muslim
for the presidency of the Bosnian Serb republic drew away tens of
thousands of Muslim votes from Plavsic and helped Poplasen.
	   Western powers now fear Poplasen would use the considerable
powers of the office _ ability to propose a Prime Minister and
eventually dissolve the parliament _ to reinforce his hard-liners.
	   Yet, they believe they will be able to work with Poplasen.
	   ``Even if Mr. Poplasen was to win against Mrs. Plavsic, given
the trend, he is unlikely to be in any particularly strong
position,'' Haselock said.
	   Post-election tensions have brought the special US envoy, Robert
Gelbard, back to Bosnia.
	   While visiting the southern town of Mostar, Gelbard indicated he
would be willing to work with whoever wins the election, pending
they respect the Dayton peace accord.
	   ``Everybody I talked to tell they are pro-Dayton; Mr. Poplasen
says he loves the Dayton agreement and now, greatest miracle of
all, Mr. Krajisnik says he loves the Dayton agreement too,''
Gelbard told reporters. ``I do not accept promises and commitments
any more, I accept facts and accomplishments.''
	   ``We are prepared to provide a serious economic support to those
who are implementing the Dayton agreement,'' Gelbard said. ``Those
who do not, are going to receive serious sanctions.''

Aliyev pledges government will stick to democracy, rule of law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Azeri President Geidar Aliyev told a
rally of some 50,000 people on Saturday that his government would
remain committed to democracy and the rule of law.
	   Aliyev is running for re-election in October. With leading
opposition figures boycotting the election, Aliyev's victory is
almost certain.
	   Aliyev told the rally at a motorcycle race-track in Baku that he
hadn't wanted to run for president, but that the people had
demanded his candidacy. He said that his rule had seen great
achievements, but also conceded that mistakes had been made. He did
not elaborate.
	   Aliyev said that the government must work to win back the
Armenian-inhabited Nagorno-Karabakh region, which declared
independence in 1988 and drove Azerbaijani troops out with
Armenia's help.
	   ``If we don't succeed in solving this problem peacefully, the
people will find its methods for solving it,'' Aliyev warned.
	   The opposition is boycotting the Oct. 11 election, accusing
Aliyev of exercising too much control over the Central Election
Commission. Aliyev was Communist Party chief when Azerbaijan was a
Soviet republic, and has exercised strong control over the country
as president.

Soldiers seize ex-warlord's home in pitched battle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fighting raging near presidential palace,
military barracks. No pickup.
 &UR; BY JONATHAN PAYE-LAYLEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Government troops captured the
residence of former warlord Roosevelt Johnson on Saturday during
more than half-a-day of pitched fighting with Johnson's ex-rebel
supporters.
	   The bodies of at least six people lay in the streets of downtown
Monrovia and dozens of wounded civilians poured into local
hospitals and clinics. Streets were nearly deserted as frightened
residents barred the doors to their homes.
	   Machine-gun fire, exploding hand grenades and mortars erupted
overnight Friday when President Charles Taylor's personal security
unit surrounded Johnson's spacious apartment complex on the
southern edge of the city center.
	   Johnson reportedly fled his residence as throngs of his
supporters stripped half-naked and opened fire on the government
soldiers. Battles continued Saturday as Taylor's forces carried out
house-to-house searches for Johnson's followers.
	   Taylor said his soldiers had merely been trying to seize a
building that he said was illegally occupied by Johnson's ethnic
Krahn ex-rebels.
	   The president blamed the fighting on Johnson's men, saying an
arrest warrant had been issued for the former rebel leader, who he
said was hiding in the U.S. embassy. The claim could not be
independently confirmed and U.S. officials in Monrovia were
unreachable.
	   ``Enough is enough,'' Taylor told reporters. ``We will not react
kindly to any attempt by the U.S. government to evacuate those
individuals from Liberia.''
	   Several government soldiers were wounded because they had not
been expecting a battle.
	   Fighting, which at one point raged near the presidential palace
and within Monrovia's main military barracks, subsided to sporadic
gunshots by Saturday evening, as government troops patrolled the
city streets shouting jubilantly.
	   West African peacekeepers based in the capital fell back to the
outskirts of the city after President Charles Taylor's soldiers
encircled Johnson's residence overnight near the city center.
	   There was no explanation for the withdrawal, although a
government official who asked to remain anonymous said the
Nigerian-led peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG had agreed not to
intervene in what amounted to a government operation to round up
opponents.
	   In a radio broadcast, Information Minister Joe Mulba called on
residents to report ``dissident'' forces to authorities so they
could be arrested.
	   Nurses and doctors were called on to treat an unknown number of
wounded, including women and children, officials said on condition
of anonymity.
	   Taylor's personal military security unit has been involved in
clashes on several occasions in recent months with Johnson's
supporters, who have accused the president of trying to kidnap and
assassinate their leader.
	   Johnson on Friday told journalists that members of his former
Ulimo-J rebel group were disgruntled by Taylor's refusal to allow
ECOMOG direct the formation of a new national military and police
force. Instead, Taylor had handpicked members of his own former
rebel group.
	   The government has repeatedly called for the eviction of
Johnson's supporters from homes they allegedly illegally occupy
nearby their leader's spacious apartment, which is usually guarded
by ECOMOG troops.
	   Many Liberians have vivid memories of the country's seven-year
civil war that left 150,000 people dead and prompted countless
thousands more to flee their homes.
	   Johnson is a former arch-foe of Taylor, but the two were among a
number of warlords who signed a fragile truce in 1996. Johnson
returned from exile to become Liberia's rural development minister
after Taylor won last July's presidential elections.
	   Earlier this year, Johnson ignored an offer from Taylor to
become Liberia's first ambassador to India.

Hurricane watches posted in eastern Caribbean as Georges nears

	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Residents of small islands in
the eastern Caribbean stocked up on food and water as Hurricane
Georges grew bigger, stronger and closer Saturday.
	   At 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) Saturday, the National Hurricane Center
in Miami said Georges was centered about 510 miles (815 kilometers)
east of the Lesser Antilles, with sustained winds of 125 mph (200
kph).
	   Georges grew bigger as well as stronger Saturday, with hurricane
force winds extending 45 miles (70 kilometers) from the center.
	   Georges' sustained winds make it a category three hurricane,
which is capable of causing extensive damage.
	   Under sunny skies on the island of Dominica, the usually busy
Saturday morning markets were more active than usual as residents
stocked up on necessities while fishermen hauled their boats from
the water.
	   In the neighboring French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe,
forecasters began warning residents Friday night to take Georges
seriously.
	   Jean-Jack Queyranne, the French minister of overseas
departments, sent 40 public service officers each to Martinique and
Guadeloupe to prepare for the hurricane.
	   The Hurricane Center said Georges was moving west-northwest at
18 mph (29 kph), slightly slower than its progress Friday.
	   With no major weather systems in its path, there was nothing to
turn Georges from its course toward the islands _ which could be
hit sometime Sunday morning.
	   ``Right now, it looks like it's going to stay on its westward
movement,'' said Brian Mahar, forecaster at the Hurricane Center.
``There's nothing major out there ahead of it.''
	   Hurricane watches extended around the northeastern rim of the
Caribbean from St. Lucia in the south to the U.S. Virgin Islands in
the north, and warnings were expected later Saturday for the
easternmost islands.

Tyson apologizes again, promises to behave
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with new detail; quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson apologized once again Saturday for
biting Evander Holyfield's ears in a title bout and promised the
state Athletic Commission of Nevada that he would behave if he is
allowed to return to the ring.
	   He said he always seems to get into trouble because he's ``an
easy target.''
	   ``Basically, if anyone knows me, I'm a pretty grass-roots type
of guy,'' Tyson told the commissioners. ``I'm belligerent sometimes
when I'm provoked. I'm tired of people trying to take advantage of
me, trying to bully me around and antagonize me. It's been
pervasive for so many years that I'm a bad seed.''
	   At the hearing to determine whether Tyson will regain his boxing
license in the western American state _ and be cleared of most
hurdles of getting sanction for a bout in the United States, lawyer
Dale Kinsella began by reading a letter from the former heavyweight
boxing champ addressed to commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem.
	   ``I acknowledge that I made a mistake and again I apologize for
it,'' Tyson said in the letter. ``I assure you this kind of
behavior will not repeat itself. Let's put this behind us and allow
boxing to be what it should be, the best sport in the world.''
	   Tyson, who arrived on a red motorcycle wearing a leather jacket
and jeans, sat in front of the commissioners as his lawyer read the
letter. Sitting at the table with Tyson were his wife, Monica, and
other lawyers and advisers.
	   Kinsella told the commission that Tyson was a changed man who
has suffered ``financially, massively'' in the 14 months he hasn't
been allowed to fight. The boxer has surrounded himself with a new
set of advisers and lawyers, Kinsella said, meaning that he is no
longer associated with Don King and others Tyson feels cheated him.
	   ``He has significantly changed his life,'' the lawyer said.
	   Tyson is nearly broke and can't afford to wait another year to
return to the ring, his advisers say. The commission's ban last
year has cost the fighter dlrs 50 million to dlrs 65 million, and
he may be forced to box outside the United States if the commission
rejects his request.
	   Kinsella presented a chart to the commissioners that showed
Tyson received just dlrs 5.2 million of the dlrs 30 million he was
supposed to earn from the last Holyfield fight. Most of it was lost
to taxes, King's take, and a dlrs 3 million fine for biting the
champion.
	   In addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. federal
government's tax collection agency, has placed a dlrs 13 million
lien on Tyson for unpaid taxes, and the boxer is facing an dlrs 8
million judgment in a civil lawsuit to former trainer Kevin Rooney,
which is being appealed.
	   While Tyson may have suffered financially, his character is also
a central issue.
	   He's accused of assaulting two men following a minor traffic
accident involving his wife's Rolls-Royce in a Washington, D.C.,
suburb. A preliminary hearing is set for Oct. 2.
	   Because the matter is pending, Kinsella said Tyson would not
answer questions about it and asked the commissioners not the raise
the issue.
	   When commissioner Lorenzo Fertitta asked Tyson why he always
seemed to be getting in trouble, Tyson said he's been an ``easy
target'' for years.
	   Another issue with the commission is Tyson's application for a
license in the eastern state of New Jersey, which like Nevada is a
popular boxing venue due to its casino gambling industry.
	   The application in New Jersey was seen as an attempt to get
around the Nevada ban. The boxer withdrew that application last
month, the night before the New Jersey commission was to issue its
decision.
	   Finkel apologized to the commissioners on Saturday for going to
New Jersey, saying it was his idea. ``Hopefully, this will not be
held against us,'' he said.
	   Tyson entered the meeting room surrounded by bodyguards and an
entourage of about a dozen people.
	   On a hill next to the building where the hearing was held stood
a green, 3-meter (10-foot) sign that said: ``Mike Tyson Is Still
Our Hero.'' Six protesters from the feminist group the National
Organization for Women demonstrated outside the building.
	   If Tyson gets his license back he could fight again in the
United States before the end of the year. Rejection could mean
another year out of the ring _ at least in Nevada and the American
states that honor its suspension _ and threaten a career that was
fading even before he bit Holyfield.
	   Tyson reportedly has had offers from promoters in other
countries to fight for lucrative purses, money he needs despite
having made more than dlrs 100 million in the ring in the two years
before the last Holyfield fight.
	   Other American states have so far honored Nevada's ban on Tyson,
and would probably continue to do so if he were denied a license.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A top international delegation criticized
both the government and opposition Saturday for their part in
rioting this week that threatened to topple the elected leadership.
	   Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe blamed ex-President Sali Berisha for the unrest.
	   Berisha remained defiant. A high-level meeting of his Democratic
Party on Saturday rejected government demands that it recognize its
authority and condemn the violence unleashed nearly a week ago by
Berisha supporters as a condition for dialogue.
	   The meeting also pledged to continue ``massive protest'' against
the government.

Threat of terrorism is evident inside halls of General Assembly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With UN-Khatami &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Unprecedented security will greet world
leaders when they convene this week for the annual General Assembly
debate, and the reason is shaping up to be one of the session's
major themes: terrorism.
	   The U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa _ and the larger issues
surrounding them _ are expected to figure prominently in comments
by the 181 speakers who will begin gathering Monday for two weeks
of back-to-back policy talk.
	   Other hot topics this year are the conflict in Kosovo, the
financial turmoil in Asia, Europe and Latin America and the nuclear
threat in South Asia.
	   But it is the growing threat of international terrorism which
will overshadow at least the first day of the general debate, when
President Bill Clinton will take the podium and tell the world why
the war on terrorists must top its agenda.
	   ``He wants to make it clear to the international community that
the fight against terrorism is not a clash of civilizations or
cultures,'' said Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger.
``The dividing line is between those who practice, support and
tolerate terror and those who understand that terrorism is plain
and simple murder.''
	   The theme _ which has always been a fixture of General Assembly
speeches _ gained prominence this year with the near-simultaneous
bombings Aug. 7 at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania, which killed 247 people.
	   As the result of the blasts, the New York City Police Department
is sealing off the main avenue in front of the United Nations for
10 days beginning Saturday night. Usually, traffic is blocked only
for the first day of the speeches.
	   Trucks _ presumably the kind that can carry bombs _ aren't
allowed within a half-mile (kilometer) of the building along that
avenue. Massive sand trucks will block anyone from plowing through
police barricades.
	   All of which will just make it a little more complicated to get
the 26 heads of state, two crown princes, one vice president and
152 other ministers to the podium on time.
	   Clinton will be followed Monday by South African President
Nelson Mandela, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi _ whose own agendas will also set the
theme for the next two weeks.
	   Mandela is expected to discuss the regional conflicts that are
consuming the African continent and which Mandela himself has taken
personal initiatives to settle. Congo, Angola and other disputes
are expected to be discussed more fully later in the week during an
African ministerial meeting on the sidelines of the debate.
	   Khatami will be making a bit of history in his speech,
regardless of what he says about Tehran's threats of war against
Afghanistan's Taliban religious militia over the deaths of Iranian
diplomats in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   This is the first time in 12 years that Iran has been
represented at the head of state level at the General Assembly _ an
indication of Khatami's desire to open a new dialogue with the
west, and particular the United States.
	   Toward that end, his foreign minister is expected to meet with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during an eight-nation
discussion on the situation along the Iran-Afghanistan border. It
will be the highest level contact between the United States and
Iran since rabid fundamentalists took control in Tehran in 1979 and
seized the U.S. Embassy.
	   In spite of all the foreign policy talk, many will be
concentrating instead on Clinton's reception Monday morning, when
he will speak within hours of the release of his videotaped
testimony in the Monica Lewinsky affair. Asked how he thought
Clinton would be welcomed, Security Council president Hans Dahlgren
of Sweden said simply, ``with respect.''

first-set loss to easily defeat fellow Spaniard Albert Portas 3-6,
6-0, 6-2 to reach the final of the dlrs 350,000 Romanian Open.
	   In the other semifinal match, unseeded Arnaud Di Pasquale of

	   Di Pasquale and Voinea battled each otehr from the baseline in
an attempt to outlast the other.
	   After they split the first two sets, Di Pasquale prevailed on a
series of unforced errors by Voinea on the Progresul arena's clay
court.
	   Both matches were delayed several hours by heavy rain.

	   The Clinton grand jury testimony, the Lewinsky testimony and the
rest of the 2,800 pages of Starr documents will be made public by
the House Judiciary Committee when the Clinton videotape is
released at approximately 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT) Monday.
	   The Government Printing Office is printing the materials in
bound form.
	   Sometime after the printed transcripts are distributed _ how
much longer is not known _ we expect to get the materials
electronically.
	   We are planning a variety of news stories after the release.
Moving will be a mainbar, a color story and several sidebars on
merit.
	   Because of the volume, the full texts of the testimony and
documents will not move on regular news wires.
	   Instead, once they are in electronic form, we will provide the
full texts in ASCII and HTML formats at an ftp site. We have
arranged for an ftp server with additional capacity to handle the
expected demand. This means the files will not be at the same
address used to deliver the Starr report last week.
	   We will send an advisory Sunday with the address of the ftp
server and a number to call Monday to get the username and
password. The username and password will NOT be available before
then.
	   Running excerpts will move on regular news wires in two
versions, a long and a short. We cannot estimate wordage until we
see the documents. The excerpts will be edited; much of the
sexually graphic detail may be deleted and any that remains will be
carefully flagged.
	   The full transcripts on the ftp site and will be unedited and
will move in the official form provided by the House Judiciary
Committee.
	   Edited video clips in RealVideo and QuickTime formats from the
videotape of President Clinton's testimony will also be available
at the ftp site.
	   Additionally, we will post the text files and video excerpts on
The WIRE, the AP's public Web site that is displayed by newspaper
and broadcast sites around the world.
	   APTV, the AP's international video service that provides video
to 200 broadcasters in the United States and abroad, plans to carry
the video in full, unedited, as soon as it is made available.
	   Warnings about explicit language will be shown both on screen
and in APTV advisories before the tapes are played.
	   AP's Hotline audio channel will carry the audio from the tapes
live, as they are released on Capitol Hill. This transmission will
be unanchored. In addition, AP Network News and AP's actualities
service will have sound bites from the tape throughout the day.

Bundesliga chairman elected amidst German soccer crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ With German soccer in turmoil since
the country's dismal World Cup performance, Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder
Saturday was reelected to the post of chairman of the Bundesliga'
governing committee.
	   But VfB Stuttgart's president may not hold the job very long
amidst growing pressure to change the position from honorary to a
full-time paid position.
	   ``Professionals have to be led by professionals,'' said Bayern
Munich's influential Franz Beckenbauer, who last week blasted the
committee as a ``laughingstock.''
	   Mayer-Vorfelder, just one of two survivors amidst a shakeup of
the 12-member committee, refused to answer the question if he would
stay in his position if it becomes a full-time job.
	   ``We're reached the limits of what's possible with an honorary
position, but I'll answer that question when its necessary,'' he
said.
	   Since the public outrage that followed three-time champion
Germany's early ousting in the quarterfinals at the World Cup in
France, almost all its soccer structures have come under fire.
	   Head coach Berti Vogts fell victim to leading soccer figures and
the media's demands for a shakeup after German players at the World
Cup proved to be deficit both in ball-handling skills and tactics.
	   The Bundesliga governing committee, with representatives from
all 36 first and second division clubs holding an annual meeting,
also demanded more independence from the DFB, the umbrella
organization that runs soccer inside the country down to amatuers
and youth leagues.
	   Beckenbauer, despite calling the DFB ``antiquated'' last week,
gave a boost to embattled Egidius Braun's bid to be reelected
president of the organization at its annual meeting Oct. 24.
	   Beckenbauer, amidst cries from all sides for him to use his
weight to reform German soccer, was nominated to the DFB's
presidium Thursday.
	   ``I won't enter the presidium under any other president than
Braun because I know how much class he has,'' said Beckenbauer.
	   Braun received some of the heat for the German national team's
poor performance in France, along with being ripped by the media
for his chaotic search for a replacement for Vogts.
	   Erich Ribbeck, who had been unemployed as a coach for several
years, was finally selected as the new national team coach after a
frantic two-day search.
	   The Bundesliga governing committee also decided it would support
a new European super league under the auspices of UEFA, European
soccer's governing body.

	   CHIAVARI, Italy (AP)_ On the edge of the sea, under a
crystalline blue sky, Pope John Paul II on Saturday urged his flock
to spread a message of love and faith.
	   About 70,000 were present for the pope's open-air Mass in the
little resort town of Chiavari, south of Genoa.
	   Although he is stooped with age and walks slowly, the
78-year-old pontiff was in fine form, pink-cheeked, bright-eyed and
clearly enjoying close contact with the faithful.
	   At a meeting Friday night with nuns, priests and seminarians in
the town cathedral, he gave a jaunty wave with his cane and beamed.
The nuns beamed warmly back, kissing his hand as he passed through
the crowd.
	   Chiavari spared no effort in welcoming the pope.
	   A brilliant, crackling fireworks display in his honor brightened
the night sky Friday. Thousands of people lined the streets waving
papal flags whenever the popemobile passed by. Local artisans
labored for months to build the turquoise, blue and white altar on
the bay where he celebrated Mass from an elaborate crimson and gold
throne.
	   In his homily, John Paul spoke of the importance of grassroots
Christianity and of reinvigorating the faith. Everyone, he said, is
Christ's disciple.
	   ``In the community, this means to carry each others' burdens, to
share, to collaborate, to feel responsible for one another,'' he
said.
	   The pontiff was in the second day of a three-day pastoral trip
to northern Italy. He was to return to Rome on Sunday.
	   On Saturday afternoon, he flew by helicopter to Brescia, a
prosperous city of 200,000 near Lake Garda at the feet of the
Italian Alps.
	   Before thousands of admirers, he saluted Brescia's vibrant
history, noting the lovely square around him, where a soaring
Baroque cathedral rubs shoulders with chunky medieval civic
buildings.
	   The structures, he said, ``evoke your noble past and rich
history, but more than anything, they are witness to the duty of
collaboration between civil society and religion.''
	   On Sunday, the pontiff will beatify a local son who devoted
himself to promoting the Roman Catholic faith, Giuseppe Tovini.
Beatification is a step toward sainthood.
	   A lawyer and father of 10 children, Tovini founded Catholic
schools, a Catholic newspaper, banks and charities. He died in
1897, the same year another local son, Pope Paul VI, was born.
	   John Paul's predecessor, Paul was pontiff from 1963 to 1978 and
presided over the historic reforms of the Second Vatican Council.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Authorities arrested
three people and rescued several minors they said were used for
prostitution and to make pornographic videos, officials said
Saturday.
	   One of the three arrested was the grandmother of one of the
minors. She was charged with complicity in the operation.
	   Investigators seized 72 videos and said they believed the
suspects had connections in Puerto Rico, St. Martin and Thailand.
	   The Dominican authorities identified the two main suspects as
Finn Jensen, 66, a Danish citizen, and Hubert Barkhasse, 82, a U.S.
citizen. Both were charged with sexual abuse of a minor.
	   Police said Berrita Almonte Pena, the grandmother of a
3-year-old who was allegedly one of the victims, was arrested
because she knew what was happening although she was not a
participant.
	   Police said Barkhasse, originally from Philadelphia, brought
homosexual men from the United States and Thailand to the Dominican
Republic for sex with minors. He also allegedly traveled to St.
Martin with the minors.
	   The two suspects also traveled frequently to Puerto Rico, and
investigators believe they distributed their videos there.

	   BATU PAHAT, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's most
popular rebel politician, on Saturday accused Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad of coercing testimony to set him up in a sodomy
case.
	   Anwar, who was fired as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on Sept. 2, said his adopted brother and a friend were
tortured into confessing that he had sodomized them.
	   That crime in conservative Muslim Malaysia could lead to Anwar's
quick arrest, preventing him from speaking against Mahathir in
Freedom Square on Sunday, during a visit of Britain's Queen
Elizabeth II.
	   Anwar, 51, married with six children, categorically denied that
there was any ``iota of truth'' in the confessions. He said the
guilty pleas had been extorted through torture under which ``even
the strongest would crumble.''
	   Mahathir ``has given instructions to continue these massive
arrests of people, intimidation and torture,'' Anwar said of the
prime minister, who controls the police as minister of home
affairs. Mahathir is also now the finance minister.
	   Government television reported the sodomy confessions Saturday
night, and quoted a Cabinet minister as saying Anwar has ``no right
to challenge Mahathir.''
	   Police have said Anwar may be arrested any day on allegations
that include sexual misconduct and treason. He has not been
formally charged.
	   Anwar, once Mahathir's heir-apparent, has said he is being
targeted because he has become a serious challenge to Mahathir's
grip on power.
	   Anwar recently has embarked on a national campaign, making
speeches that have drawn enthusiastic crowds. He has called on
Mahathir to step down, accusing him of corruption.

Fire damages family home of Manchester United star Giggs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ A fire damaged the home of soccer
star Ryan Giggs' family on Saturday, and fire authorities described
it as a suspicious blaze.
	   The Manchester United player's mother and 6-year-old sister were
staying with friends when the blaze started, and his 21-year-old
brother Rhodri fled the flames without reported injury.
	   Press Association, the national news agency, said Rhodri Giggs
was reported to have told the police that he might have been the
target because he had been involved in a pub argument.
	   A fire brigade spokesman said the fire was severe and had
started in the living room of the small row house in Swinton,
Manchester, in northern England.
	   ``There was obviously something suspicious,'' the spokesman said
anonymously, in keeping with British custom.
	   The two ground floor windows of the white brick row cottage were
boarded up.

Tyson apologizes again, promises to behave

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson apologized once again Saturday for
biting Evander Holyfield's ears in a title bout and promised the
state Athletic Commission of Nevada that he would behave if he is
allowed to return to the ring.
	   At the hearing to determine whether he will regain his boxing
license in the western American state, Tyson said he always seems
to get into trouble because he's ``an easy target.''
	   ``I'm belligerent sometimes when I'm provoked,'' he told the
commissioners. ``I'm tired of people trying to take advantage of
me, trying to bully me around and antagonize me. It's been
pervasive for so many years that I'm a bad seed.''
	   Tyson, who arrived on a red motorcycle wearing a leather jacket
and jeans, sounded testy at times and at other times buried his
head in his hands as if he were disgusted. At one point he said he
was being ``humiliated.''
	   His lawyer, Dale Kinsella, opened the hearing by reading a
letter from the former heavyweight champ addressed to commission
chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem.
	   ``I acknowledge that I made a mistake and again I apologize for
it,'' Tyson said in the letter. ``I assure you this kind of
behavior will not repeat itself. Let's put this behind us and allow
boxing to be what it should be, the best sport in the world.''
	   Tyson sat at a table in front of the commissioners as his lawyer
read the letter. Sitting with Tyson were his wife, Monica, and
other lawyers and advisers, and the audience included celebrities
such as basketball stars Magic Johnson and Karl Malone.
	   Kinsella told the commission that Tyson was a changed man who
has suffered ``financially, massively'' in the 14 months he hasn't
been allowed to fight. The boxer has surrounded himself with a new
set of advisers and lawyers, Kinsella said, meaning that he is no
longer associated with Don King and others Tyson feels cheated him.
	   ``He has significantly changed his life,'' the lawyer said.
	   Tyson is nearly broke and can't afford to wait another year to
return to the ring, his advisers say. The commission's ban last
year has cost the fighter dlrs 50 million to dlrs 65 million, and
he may be forced to box outside the United States if the commission
rejects his request.
	   Kinsella presented a chart to the commissioners that showed
Tyson received just dlrs 5.2 million of the dlrs 30 million he was
supposed to earn from the last Holyfield fight. Most of it was lost
to taxes, King's take, and a dlrs 3 million fine for biting the
champion.
	   In addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. federal
government's tax collection agency, has placed a dlrs 13 million
lien on Tyson for unpaid taxes, and the boxer is facing an dlrs 8
million judgment in a civil lawsuit to former trainer Kevin Rooney,
which is being appealed.
	   During the discussion of Tyson's finances, the boxer interrupted
the commissioners, saying, ``My life is on trial, so to speak. I'm
not going to allow other people to have nice things and my kids to
starve. You've got to understand I care about my kids.''
	   Commissioner Luther Mack then asked him how many contracts he
had signed in his career, and Tyson snapped, ``Do you really think
I know, sir? Do you know any fighter who can actually say that?''
	   Mack said he wasn't trying to humiliate him.
	   ``You are humiliating me,'' Tyson said.
	   While Tyson may have suffered financially, his character is also
a central issue.
	   He's accused of assaulting two men following a minor traffic
accident involving his wife's Rolls-Royce in a Washington, D.C.,
suburb. A preliminary hearing is set for Oct. 2.
	   Because the matter is pending, Kinsella said Tyson would not
answer questions about it and asked the commissioners not the raise
the issue.
	   When commissioner Lorenzo Fertitta asked Tyson why he always
seemed to be getting in trouble, Tyson said he's been an ``easy
target'' for years.
	   Later, physiologist Norton Roitman, who examined Tyson last
month, told the commissioners that the fighter has changed his life
for the better and has a bright future. He said Tyson is ``sort of
desperate to feel touched and loved.''
	   Another issue with the commission is Tyson's application for a
license in the eastern state of New Jersey, which like Nevada is a
popular boxing venue due to its casino gambling industry.
	   The application in New Jersey was seen as an attempt to get
around the Nevada ban. The boxer withdrew that application last
month, the night before the New Jersey commission was to issue its
decision.
	   Finkel apologized to the commissioners on Saturday for going to
New Jersey, saying it was his idea. ``Hopefully, this will not be
held against us,'' he said.
	   Tyson entered the meeting room surrounded by bodyguards and an
entourage of about a dozen people.
	   On a hill next to the building where the hearing was held stood
a green, 3-meter (10-foot) sign that said: ``Mike Tyson Is Still
Our Hero.'' Six protesters from the feminist group the National
Organization for Women demonstrated outside the building.
	   If Tyson gets his license back he could fight again in the
United States before the end of the year. Rejection could mean
another year out of the ring _ at least in Nevada and the American
states that honor its suspension _ and threaten a career that was
fading even before he bit Holyfield.
	   Tyson reportedly has had offers from promoters in other
countries to fight for lucrative purses, money he needs despite
having made more than dlrs 100 million in the ring in the two years
before the last Holyfield fight.
	   Other American states have so far honored Nevada's ban on Tyson,
and would probably continue to do so if he were denied a license.

Sensationalist TV host killed in Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Gunmen in northeastern Brazil
killed a television journalist famed for exposing shady dealings of
politicians and businessmen, colleagues said Saturday.
	   Donizete Adauto, 38, was hauled from his car by six men and shot
just after midnight Friday, said producer Aparecida Oliveira of the
Meio Norte TV station.
	   Adauto's daily show, which specialized in investigative
journalism, was broadcast locally in the poor, northeastern state
of Piaui, 1,200 miles (2,000 kms) north of Rio.
	   ``The type of show he did was very close to the limit. He used
to receive a lot of death threats,'' Oliveira said by telephone
from Teresina, the capital of Piaui.
	   The station and Adauto's family offered a reward for information
leading to the killers, she said.
	   Aduato was a candidate for the federal congress in national
elections scheduled for Oct. 4. He was killed just after leaving a
political meeting in Teresina.

Suspect rearrested in deaths of two women tourists

	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ A suspect has been rearrested and will be
charged Monday with killing two women tourists whose bodies were
discovered hours apart in August, police said Saturday.
	   The 18-year-old suspect, who has not yet been identified pending
the formal filing of charges, had been initially taken into custody
by police on August 22, the day the bodies were found. Police
Commissioner B.K. Bonamy said Saturday that new evidence had led
police to arrest the suspect again, but he did not disclose what it
was.
	   The suspect will be accused of killing Lori Fogleman, a
32-year-old school teacher from Richmond, Virginia, and Joanne
Clark, 24, of Oxfordshire, England, Bonamy said.
	   The FBI and Scotland Yard sent officers to assist local police
in investigating the two killings.

Government warns of major offensive on Congo rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila's government
promised Saturday a ``mass counter-offensive'' against rebels based
in eastern Congo, after government war planes reportedly headed
east from the capital.
	   Bombers painted in Congo's national military colors left
Kinshasa's international airport on Friday headed for unknown
destinations in eastern Congo, several airport workers said on
condition of anonymity.
	   State radio, which has served as a mouthpiece for Kabila's
government, reported Saturday that ``victory is in the air for the
Congolese people.''
	   An imminent counter-offensive will ``change the course of
things'' and end with the rebels' defeat, state Voice of the People
radio said citing unnamed military sources.
	   Also citing anonymous officials, Kinshasa newspaper editor Amisi
Kilosho said the offensive will likely occur on Sunday or Monday
and begin in the town of Bukavu on Congo's eastern border with
Rwanda.
	   Bukavu is one of three major towns held by the rebels. The
others are Kisangani and the rebel's main base of Goma, which was
attacked by government forces for the first time last week.
	   ``The (counter-attack) may be difficult and dangerous but it
will go ahead nevertheless,'' Kilosho, editor of the Weekly
Reporter, said.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of Tutsi fighters, former Kabila allies
and military men in the army of the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko
_ are entrenched in several cities in the country's east.
	   The insurgents were repelled on the outskirts of the capital
after making gains at the beginning of the rebellion in early
August. A key reason for the loyalist's resurgence was the arrival
of Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian forces to aid Kabila's ailing
military.
	   Although Kabila has few military airplanes, several old bombers
used by Mobutu's former army have been recently repaired, Kabila's
government has said. Angola and Zimbabwe have also sent a number of
bombers, fighters and transport planes to Congo.
	   The rebels, who accuse Kabila of corruption and ethnic
war-mongering, say Sudanese military forces and rebels from Rwanda
and Burundi have been recruited to help Kabila. The government has
denied the charges.
	   Uganda and Rwanda are widely believed to be backing the rebel
insurgency. Both countries have denied direct involvement although
Uganda says it has troops in Congo under an earlier border defense
agreement.

Lyon strikers in form as champion Lens beaten 3-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ High-flying Lyon took full advantage of its rivals'
inactivity Saturday, beating champion Lens 3-1 to move within one
point of leader Bordeaux.
	   Strikers Marco Grassi and Alain Caveglia both scored their
fourth goal of the season for Lyon, which won at England's
Blackburn Rovers 1-0 in the UEFA Cup Tuesday.
	   In front of 26,000 spectators, Grassi scored first in the 12
minute, firing a Caveglia cross past goalkeeper Guillaume Warmuz
from close range.
	   Caveglia made it 2-0 in the 31st minute, collecting a
through-ball from the outstanding Vikash Dhorasoo to lob the
goalkeeper.
	   Wagneau Eloi pulled one back for Lens in the 75th minute but
Joseph Job made the game safe near the end.
	   Lyon was the only top four team in action Saturday.
	   On Sunday, leader Bordeaux visits fourth-placed Marseille, while
Monaco, currently third, travels to Paris Saint-Germain in the
sixth round of the championship.
	   Nantes missed its chance to make up ground on the leaders after
being held 1-1 at home by Brittany minnow Lorient.
	   Montpellier, this season's top scorer with 14 goals, also failed
to beat modest opposition, drawing 1-1 at home to Nancy.
	   Soufiane Kone scored for the visitors in the 9th minute before
Xavier Gravelaine, a recent signing from Marseille, equalized from
the penalty spot just before the break.
	   Metz, runnerup last year, is still without a league goal after
540 minutes of play this season after drawing 0-0 at home to
Toulouse.
	   Bruno Rodriguez, Metz's top scorer last season, missed a
second-half penalty.
	   In other games Saturday: Auxerre 3, Sochaux 1; Le Havre 0,
Strasbourg 1; Rennes 2, Bastia 0. (fap-ae)

Playing with dark and light at the Toronto Film festival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL FLEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Very bad things happened in the movies at the
Toronto International Film Festival, from pedophilia to body-part
tossing to murder in virtually every form.
	   But some old-fashioned hope, tenderness and love were able to
pierce the darkness at North America's biggest movie festival,
which ended Saturday.
	   Audiences laughed and cried with the Irish villagers in ``Waking
Ned Devine'' and with the American family in Paris in ``A Soldier's
Daughter Never Cries.''
	   The dark, upsetting themes were led by ``Very Bad Things.''
Cameron Diaz (hot off ``There's Something About Mary'') and
Christian Slater (just out of jail after serving time for battery)
star in a story about a party that goes awry in horrible and bloody
ways. At one point, the characters play catch with dismembered body
parts.
	   This is a comedy.
	   ``The films are at polar opposites, as if there's a kind of
breakdown in consensus in terms of overriding values or overriding
mood,'' said festival director Piers Handling, an author and movie
academic. ``How do you characterize this era right now? Obviously,
it's a very confused time.''
	   How confusing? The harshest, bloodiest, most brutally realistic
movie of the year came from escapism artist Steven Spielberg
(``Saving Private Ryan''). His DreamWorks studio also created
Saturday's festival-capping film ``Antz,'' an animated fantasy and
the most overtly commercial movie of the 10-day event.
	   And as much as people talked about disturbing scenes in the edgy
films ``Clay Pigeons'' and ``Sombre,'' those movies had to compete
with the news out of Washington (very big in Canada, too) about
disturbing scenes in a White House hallway.
	   As for the buyers looking for independent films to distribute,
tastes were as divergent as the festival lineup.
	   Paramount's new arthouse division, Paramount Classics, picked up
an offbeat comedy, ``The Adventures of Sebastian Cole,'' while
Trimark went after the considerably darker ``Another Day in
Paradise,'' an ironically titled tale of drugs and petty crime.
	   Also finding distributors were ``Desert Blue,'' a romance set
against a chemical spill in a remote town; ``Run Lola Run,'' a
stylish thriller from Germany, and ``Autumn Tale,'' French director
Eric Rohmer's look at middle age and romance.
	   But the movies that attracted some of the most attention were
the ones that had distribution already set up.
	   ``Happiness'' deals with a respected family man who rapes a
little boy. The black comedy, which also was a hit at the Cannes
festival, was so racy that October Releasing wouldn't release it,
so the producers opted to distribute it themselves.
	   Another touch of evil was ``Apt Pupil,'' one of several movies
tapping into that deepest of horrors, the Holocaust. The adaptation
of a Stephen King novella is about a teen-ager who blackmails an
aging Nazi.
	   The Italian film ``Life is Beautiful'' also draws on the
Holocaust, this time as a backdrop for a comedy-love story.
	   ``The banality of evil'' is how The Toronto Star summed up the
festival in Saturday's editions, with critic Peter Howell writing
that new movies are ``redefining notions of bad taste and excess by
making the ghastly seem commonplace.''
	   The New York Times said the films ``lounge on the dark side of
humanity.''
	   Busy independent film producer Beau Flynn sees it, too, and
suggests that some filmmakers feel that to be the next Martin
Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino they have to outdo those experts in
screen bloodletting.
	   ``I do work very hard to keep them level. They forget about the
content and heart of the movie,'' he said. ``There's so much
pressure. They feel they have one shot.''
	   Flynn's own festival entry, ``Judas Kiss,'' enters into the
Tarantino area. The jazzy crime thriller about a kidnapping that
goes in unexpected directions features a graphic torture scene.
	   But, Flynn insisted, ``compared to what could have been and what
we talked about, there could have been a stronger tone of
violence.''
	   In fact, the most shocking thing about the film are Brits Emma
Thompson and Alan Rickman speaking with southern drawls _ which was
almost as startling as raspy Texan Kris Kristofferson speaking
French (albeit briefly) in ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.''
	   The Merchant Ivory film offered another festival shocker: it was
that rare film about a functional family, whose members, despite
their ups and downs, work out their problems with love and
understanding.
	   No pedophiles in the bunch.
	   The movie received a standing ovation, as did ``Waking Ned
Devine,'' about a small Irish town turned upside down when one of
its inhabitants wins the lottery _ then promptly dies holding the
ticket. Much of the talk about the film centered on the comic nude
scenes by the lead male characters, ages 69 and 70.
	   Also getting an enthusiastic reception was the rambunctious
comedy ``Little Voice,'' about a quiet young woman who can express
herself only by belting out Judy Garland numbers. Michael Caine
plays the shifty agent who wants to make her a star.
	   ``When we went into this festival, we said it would be wildly
divergent,'' Handling said.

Trinidad and Tobago chosen to host Miss Universe 1999 pageant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago (AP) _ Miss Universe Wendy
Fitzwilliam will be right at home when she gives away her crown
next year, as her home nation of Trinidad and Tobago was chosen to
host the 1999 pageant.
	   Trade and Tourism Minister Mervyn Assam made the announcement at
a news conference Saturday, saying that Trinidad and Tobago had bid
dlrs 3 million to host the pageant.
	   Fitzwilliam's reign as Miss Universe helped the Caribbean
country win out over other contenders such as Mexico, Jamaica and
Israel, even though it did not make the highest bid, said Assam.
	   He said he expects the country's tourism industry to benefit
from the international exposure, as a television audience of more
than 2 billion persons is expected.
	   ``It's one of my dreams come true'' to have Trinidad and Tobago
host the pageant, said Kim Sabenay, sobbing with joy. Sabenay, who
holds the Miss Universe franchise in the country, has trained two
winners during her 30 years of involvement with the pageant.
	   Assam said an organization would be established Monday to begin
work on converting a sports and cultural complex 12 miles (19
kilometers) east of Port-of-Spain into a venue for the pageant.

Israel heads into holiday on high alert; envoy's visit ending
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 7 grafs to UPDATE with Ross-Arafat meeting over,
quotes, edits to conform.

 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An American mediator on Saturday was wrapping
up his latest effort to break the 18-month Israeli-Palestinian
deadlock, claiming progress but no real breakthrough.
	   And as so often happens in Israel, tension and fear shadowed
what was supposed to be a festive occasion _ the Jewish New Year's
holiday, beginning at sundown Sunday.
	   In the West Bank _ whose border with Israel was sealed off,
along with that of the Gaza Strip _ thousands of Palestinian
supporters of the radical Islamic group Hamas staged a march
Saturday, burning U.S. and Israeli flags and screaming, ``Revenge,
revenge!''
	   U.S. envoy Dennis Ross appeared poised to head back to the
United States empty-handed after an 11-day visit to the region,
except for hopes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Yasser Arafat might try to meet in the United States next week.
	   Ross met for nearly two hours in Gaza with Arafat Saturday night
and told reporters afterward: ``We have made some headway, but
there is still work to be done.''
	   Arafat, for his part, said he was willing to meet Netanyahu when
both are in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, but
said no session had been set. Then Ross headed to Jerusalem for a
final meeting with Netanyahu.
	   In the American-brokered talks, the two sides have been trying
to reach agreement on a long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and on revised terms of a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Ross' departure was scheduled early Sunday, only hours before
the start of the two-day Rosh Hashana holiday. Commentators agreed
that as the year wound down, things looked inauspicious indeed on
the peace front.
	   ``If it's time for New Year well-wishing, let there be some
realism,'' commentator B. Michael wrote in Friday's editions of the
Yediot Ahronot daily newspaper. ``The chance that the next year
will be a good one is pretty slim.''
	   Israelis mark Rosh Hashana with special prayers and readings,
and the blowing of a ram's horn, or shofar. A traditional treat is
apple slices dipped in honey, symbolizing hopes that the coming
year will be sweet.
	   But bitterness was the overriding theme. The Palestinian
Cabinet, in a statement issued Saturday, blamed Israel for failure
to reach an accord during Ross' visit.
	   ``The mission did not achieve the progress anticipated due to
Israeli procrastination in ... acceptance of the American
initiative,'' said the Cabinet, which met late Friday.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, more than 3,000 supporters of
the radical
	   Islamic group Hamas rallied Saturday, waving green Hamas flags
and singing nationalistic songs. Palestinian police did not
interfere with the march, staged in a Palestinian-controlled area.
	   ``The blood of our murdered ones will not be wasted!'' said
Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin, addressing the
demonstrators by telephone hookup from Gaza.
	   Hamas has vowed to avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers Imad
and Adel Awadallah, top fugitives who were shot dead by Israeli
troops in a bloody raid on their West Bank hideout.
	   Near the West Bank town of Ramallah, Israeli troops and
Palestinian demonstrators fought small-scale skirmishes over
several hours on Saturday. About 20 youths on a highway overpass
outside Ramallah tore down protective fencing meant to keep them
from stoning motorists.
	   ``Allahu akbar _ God is great!'' they shouted as they flung
chunks of stone that slammed into a passing Israeli army jeep.
Soldiers jumped out, guns at the ready, and fired tear gas to
disperse the youths. No injuries were reported.
	   Later, near an Israeli checkpoint south of Ramallah,
Palestinians threw stones at soldiers and burned tires, sending
plumes of black smoke into the air. The official Voice of Palestine
radio said Israeli troops encircled the area.
	   Arafat, meanwhile, accused the Israeli government of condoning
violence by
	   Jewish settlers against Palestinians, and said such attacks were
destroying
	   prospects for peace. A Palestinian youth was shot dead Thursday
by a Jewish settler near the West Bank village of Beitunia.
	   The settler said he acted in self-defense after his car was
stoned; Palestinians said the shooting was unprovoked. A magistrate
ordered the settler held over until at least Sunday.
	   ``These crimes happen, and we haven't heard any denunciation of
such acts by the Israeli government,'' Arafat told his Cabinet.
	   At their meeting late Friday, Palestinian ministers discussed
preparations
	   for a unilateral declaration of statehood in May, saying
Palestinian emissaries would fan out to ``friendly countries'' to
seek pledges of recognition for any new state.
	   Earlier in the day, Palestinian parliament speaker Ahmed Qureia
had told The Associated Press the Palestinians might delay their
declaration if there were sufficient progress in negotiations with
Israel.
	   Netanyahu has hinted he would respond to any unilateral
proclamation of Palestinian statehood by annexing parts of the West
Bank, a move that would likely bring an explosion of violence.

Rafter threatens to quit Davis Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ U.S. Open tennis champion Pat Rafter
has threatened to quit Davis Cup if captain John Newcombe or coach
Tony Roche step down because of a feud with losing finalist Mark
Philippoussis.
	   ``If those guys go I'm going to resign too,'' Rafter told the
Brisbane Sunday Mail newspaper.
	   The world No. 2 also gave his rival Pete Sampras a serve,
describing him as a ``crybaby, '' and saying Sampras had taken his
last two defeats by the Australian hard.
	   ``He's become a bit of a crybaby but it doesn't worry me,'' said
Rafter.
	   Sampras had said that the difference between he and Rafter was
``10 Grand Slams'' after being beaten by the Australian in August.
	   ``It's only nine now,'' Rafter said.
	   ``The first time you win a Slam, you don't know if it's a fluke
or not. When you win a Slam for the second time, it does two things
_ shuts up the critics and shuts up yourself.
	   ``It's great to be able to do it again. I'm now thinking maybe I
do deserve to win the big ones.''
	   Rafter, who has said he will always be available to play Davis
Cup for Australia, dedicated his U.S. Open win to Roche and feels
strongly enough about the rift to support the coach and captain.
	   Roche indicated earlier in the week he may resign after
Philippoussis, who has declined recently to play Davis Cup for
Australia, accused him of showing bias towards Rafter by sitting in
Rafter's box during the final.
	   Newcombe responded by saying if Roche, with whom he won 11 grand
slam doubles titles, went he would go to.
	   ``We all really value Rochey and the reason he's so upset is
because he doesn't deserve it,'' Rafter said. ``He's never come out
looking to take abuse like that.''
	   Rafter said he and Philippoussis were starting to rekindle their
friendship.
	   ``Mark and I are starting to patch things up _ we are a lot
better than we were,'' Rafter said. ``But it's hard to defend him
when he also offends another good friend of mine.''
	   Rafter will fly to Townsville on Monday for Australia's Davis
Cup match against Uzbekistan next weekend. (djp)

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Residents of small islands in
the eastern Caribbean stocked up on food and water as Hurricane
Georges grew bigger, stronger and closer Saturday.
	   At 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) Saturday, the National Hurricane Center
in Miami said Georges was centered about 510 miles (815 kilometers)
east of the Lesser Antilles, with sustained winds of 125 mph (200
kph).
	   Georges grew bigger as well as stronger Saturday, with hurricane
force winds extending 45 miles (70 kilometers) from the center.
	   Georges' sustained winds make it a category three hurricane,
which is capable of causing extensive damage.
	   Under sunny skies on the island of Dominica, the usually busy
Saturday morning markets were more active than usual as residents
stocked up on necessities while fishermen hauled their boats from
the water.
	   In the neighboring French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe,
forecasters began warning residents Friday night to take Georges
seriously.
	   Jean-Jack Queyranne, the French minister of overseas
departments, sent 40 public service officers each to Martinique and
Guadeloupe to prepare for the hurricane.
	   The Hurricane Center said Georges was moving west-northwest at
18 mph (29 kph), slightly slower than its progress Friday.
	   A U.S. Air Force reconnaissance plane flew into Georges on
Saturday afternoon, and confirmed that winds had strengthened to
125 mph (200 kph), with stronger gusts, and was expected to begin
hitting the islands Sunday.
	   Georges' sustained winds make it a category 3 hurricane, capable
of causing extensive damage. The hurricane grew bigger as well as
stronger Saturday, with hurricane force winds extending 45 miles
(72 kilometers) from the center.

	   EL SAUZAL, Mexico (AP) _ The killers arrived in three light
trucks before dawn, dressed all in black and carrying automatic
rifles.
	   They worked quickly, professionally. And when they were done, 18
men, women and children from one extended family lay dead in
bleeding mounds beside a patio wall at the ranch by the sea in
northern Mexico.
	   ``The children said that it lasted an eternity _ an hour,'' said
state Cmdr. Felipe Perez Cruz, quoting testimony of a 12-year-old
boy and 15-year-old girl who survived the Thursday morning massacre
linked to drugs. ``It was probably 15 or 20 minutes.''
	   Statements by investigators and a tour of the blood-stained
compound a day after the killings provide signs of a well-organized
team carrying out orders to kill an alleged marijuana trafficker
and his relatives for some unknown crime against rivals in the drug
trade.
	   After driving across a dusty plain, at least nine or 10 gunmen
got out at the ranch this suburb of the Baja California resort of
Ensenada. The killers broke into three teams, each assigned to one
of the family's three houses. ``They must have known the family,''
Perez Cruz said.
	   First hit was the Tovar family household, headed by a sister of
alleged trafficker Fermin Castro _ apparently the main target. The
Tovar family was the only part of the Castro clan not believed to
have been involved with drugs, investigators say.
	   One team went through a downstairs window in the Tovar house, in
the middle of the compound. Micaria Jaime Tovar, eight months
pregnant with her second child, her 1-year-old nephew Cesar and
four other family members were taken to the patio, probably at
gunpoint.

Ten years after Seoul, Ben Johnson still dreams of comeback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Even after 10 years, he still would have held the
title of fastest man in the world.
	   And now Ben Johnson is trying to reclaim what he says he never
should have lost. The muscle-bound sprinter who was caught at the
Seoul Olympics for taking steroids is ready to return to the track
at age 36.
	   ``It feels sad to think how fast I could have gone,'' he said.
	   He did go fast, anyway, amazingly fast, blowing past Carl Lewis
in the 100 meters for a gold medal and world record of 9.79 seconds
at the 1988 Games. Stripped of the medal and the record, he was
suspended for two years, and banned for life in 1993 when he again
tested positive for steroids.
	   His second comeback bid rests on a legal battle to overturn that
ban by the International Amateur Athletic Federation. He is to
appear in Ontario Court Monday.
	   Based on assessments from his agent and lawyers, Johnson is
optimistic about the outcome, and talks of returning to world-class
competition by December or January, perhaps at meets in Australia
or South Africa.
	   He has been training regularly throughout his long exile from
athletics, and estimates he would need eight weeks of intense work
to reach peak form. He says he recently ran 80 meters in 8.14, and
believes he could start his comeback with a 100-meter time of
around 10.10.
	   ``My dream is to come back again and compete against the best in
the world,'' he said.
	   Since his lifetime ban he's dabbled in real estate and made
several public appearances to raise cash and draw attention to his
case. He's traveled to Europe and Japan several times, where the
media remain fascinated by him, and last year resorted to such
antics as racing against a Toronto radio sportscaster.
	   Johnson's agent and manager, Morris Chrobotek, is engaged in a
two-pronged offensive to get his client back on the track. He's
collecting documents that he says cast doubt on the 1993 doping
test, while focusing the court case on the issue of restraint of
trade.
	   ``Let's say Ben was driving, and maybe he was speeding,''
Chrobotek said. ``OK, you take his license away _ but not for the
rest of his life. Enough is enough.''
	   Johnson's campaign has received little support from anyone at
the higher levels of Athletics Canada, whether officials or
athletes.
	   But there seems to be a shift in Canadian media coverage of him,
treating him less like a villain and more like someone who became a
scapegoat for a widespread problem.
	   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. aired a lengthy TV documentary
this month that raised the question of whether Johnson was treated
fairly. Among those interviewed was Mark McKoy, who came back to
win a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 after a two-year
suspension.
	   ``I've always thought Ben was shafted,'' McKoy said. ``You get
caught. You do your time. You come back.''
	   Johnson's quest is followed with interest at the Canadian Center
for Ethics in Sport, which helps administer doping tests on behalf
of Canada's sports federations.
	   The center's chief executive, Victor Lachance, said Johnson is
entitled to his day in court, but suggested the sprinter might have
been better off persevering with an appeal to the IAAF.
	   Lachance said the spate of doping scandals in sports this year
underscores the scope of the problem, but disputed the notion that
this should generate sympathy for Johnson.
	   ``There is no question there is doping going on, and no question
more needs to be done to ensure we have a level playing field,''
Lachance said. ``But the fact that other people were not caught
doesn't mean anything unjust was done to Mr. Johnson.''
	   Canadian sports officials are growing weary of Johnson's
long-running reinstatement campaign and believe the lifetime ban
was proper, said Hugh Wilson, director of athlete and coach
development for Athletics Canada.
	   ``People want Ben Johnson to have a good life and make the most
of the gifts that he has, but not here in track and field,'' he
said.
	   Johnson isn't alone in his exile. His former coach, Charlie
Francis, remains banned from coaching for life, although he appears
regularly at major Canadian meets and is sought for technical
advice.
	   Jamie Astaphan, the doctor who admitted administering banned
substances to Johnson, moved back to his native St. Kitts in the
Caribbean. He and Johnson contend that the positive doping test in
Seoul resulted from American resentment that Johnson was outrunning
Lewis. Johnson, however, also has admitted that he took steroids.
	   ``I beat the Americans _ that was the problem,'' he said. ``If I
was American, this never would have happened.''
	   His bitterness extends to Canada and the United States, and he
plans to move abroad, perhaps to Italy, once his reinstatement case
is resolved. Europeans, he said, have been more supportive than
North Americans, and he never wants to race again for Canada.
	   He and Chrobotek are planning ways to make money even if they
lose the case. They're about to market a line of Ben Johnson
sweatshirts and are trying to stir up interest in a book and movie.
	   Johnson is convinced he would have proved himself the world's
greatest sprinter had the doping problems not surfaced. He says he
could have run the 100 in 9.68. (Fellow Canadian Donovan Bailey
holds the world record, 9.84).
	   ``Maybe I'll get another chance _ maybe I won't,'' Johnson said.
	   He said inner faith, and the support of his mother and sisters
has helped sustain his spirits over the years, but he doesn't feign
nonchalance.
	   ``Sometimes I feel depressed _ all human beings do,'' he said.

Israel heads into holiday on high alert; envoy's visit ending

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An American mediator on Saturday was wrapping
up his latest effort to break the 18-month Israeli-Palestinian
deadlock, claiming progress but no real breakthrough.
	   And as so often happens in Israel, tension and fear shadowed
what was supposed to be a festive occasion _ the Jewish New Year's
holiday, which begins at sundown Sunday.
	   In the West Bank _ whose border with Israel was sealed off,
along with that of the Gaza Strip _ thousands of Palestinian
supporters of the radical Islamic group Hamas staged a march
Saturday, burning U.S. and Israeli flags and screaming, ``Revenge,
revenge!''
	   U.S. envoy Dennis Ross appeared ready to head back to the United
States empty-handed after an 11-day visit to the region. Ross met
for nearly two hours in Gaza with Arafat Saturday night and told
reporters afterward: ``We have made some headway, but there is
still work to be done.''
	   Arafat, for his part, said he was willing to meet Netanyahu when
both are in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, but
said no session had been set.
	   In the American-brokered talks, the two sides have been trying
to reach an agreement on a long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank and on revised terms for a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet, in a statement issued Saturday, blamed
Israel for failure to reach an accord during Ross' visit.
	   ``The mission did not achieve the progress anticipated due to
Israeli procrastination in ... acceptance of the American
initiative,'' said the Cabinet, which met late Friday.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, more than 3,000 supporters of
the radical
	   Islamic group Hamas rallied Saturday, waving green Hamas flags
and singing nationalistic songs. Palestinian police did not
interfere with the march, staged in a Palestinian-controlled area.
	   ``The blood of our murdered ones will not be wasted!'' said
Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin, addressing the
demonstrators by telephone hookup from Gaza.
	   Hamas has vowed to avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers Imad
and Adel Awadallah, top fugitives who were shot dead by Israeli
troops in a bloody raid on their West Bank hideout.
	   Near the West Bank town of Ramallah, Israeli troops and
Palestinian demonstrators fought small-scale skirmishes over
several hours on Saturday.
	   Arafat, meanwhile, accused the Israeli government of condoning
violence by Jewish settlers against Palestinians, and said such
attacks were destroying prospects for peace.
	   At their meeting late Friday, Palestinian ministers discussed
preparations for a unilateral declaration of statehood in May,
saying Palestinian emissaries would fan out to ``friendly
countries'' to seek pledges of recognition for any new state.
	   Earlier in the day, Palestinian parliament speaker Ahmed Qureia
had told The Associated Press the Palestinians might delay their
declaration if there were sufficient progress in negotiations with
Israel.
	   Netanyahu has hinted he would respond to any unilateral
proclamation of Palestinian statehood by annexing parts of the West
Bank, a move that would likely bring an explosion of violence.

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Hurricane Georges strengthened
to a category 4 storm Saturday afternoon capable of causing extreme
damage as it bore down on the small islands of the eastern
Caribbean.
	   ``Air Force reconnaissance reports indicate that Georges is now
an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane,'' the National
Hurricane Center in Miami warned.
	   At 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) Saturday, the Hurricane Center in Miami
said Georges was centered at 15.7 north latitude and 54.4 west
longitude, about 450 miles (720 kilometers) east of the Lesser
Antilles.
	   Georges was moving west-northwest at 20 mph (32 kph) and was
expected to begin affecting the easternmost islands Sunday morning
with the center of the storm passing over the islands later in the
day.
	   Georges' sustained winds increased to 145 mph (230 kph)
Saturday, moving it up to category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale,
comparable to Hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of southern
Florida in 1992.
	   The Hurricane Center said storm surge flooding of five to 10
feet (1.5 to 3 meters) above normal tide levels should be expected
along with five to eight inches (13 to 20 centimeters) of rain,
with heavier rainfall possible in some areas.
	   Residents of the small, eastern Caribbean islands were taking
the strengthening storm seriously, stocking up on necessities
Saturday.
	   Under sunny skies in Dominica, the usually busy Saturday markets
were more active than usual as residents stocked up on necessities
while fishermen hauled their boats from the water.
	   In the neighboring French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe,
forecasters urged residents to prepare.
	   ``This is a hurricane big enough that people should remain very
vigilant and should not think that our island will be completely
spared by Georges,'' warned forecaster Danielle Decan on Radio
Caraibes in Martinique.
	   Jean-Jack Queyranne, the French minister of overseas
departments, sent 40 public service officers each to Martinique and
Guadeloupe to prepare for the hurricane.
	   The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency sent Early Response
Teams, which include health care workers, engineers, firefighters
and other professionals, to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico
ahead of the storm.
	   At 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT), the Hurricane Center extended the
hurricane watch to Puerto Rico. Watches had already been issued for
the entire northeastern rim of the Caribbean from St. Lucia in the
south to the U.S. Virgin Islands in the north.

Late Anderson goal gives Barcelona 2-2 draw with Real Madrid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Brazilian forward Sonny Anderson set up one
goal and scored one of his own in the 83rd to earn FC Barcelona a
2-2 draw with arch-rival Real Madrid in the early season meeting of
the Spanish powerhouses.
	   Anderson's second goal silenced the capacity crownd of 79,000 at
Madrid's Santiago Bernebeu Stadium, which reportedly had 1,200
police on hands for the game Primera Division officials had listed
as a ``high-risk match.''
	   The victory moved Madrid one point past Zaragoza into the league
lead with seven points after only three rounds. The Real-Barca
clash was the only first-division match contested Saturday and
Zaragoza had a chance to retake the lead on Sunday against promoted
Alaves.
	   In other third-round matches Sunday, Oviedo faces Tenerife,
Celta takes on Valladolid, Racing plays Betis, Extremadura takes on
Athletic Bilbao, Valencia plays Villareal, Salamanca takes on
Deportivo, and Atletico Madrid receives Espanyol.
	   On Saturday, Real Madrid led throughout most of the match and
appeared on the verge of a victory in the twice-annual grudge
match.
	   Raul gave Madrid the lead in the seventh minute after countryman
Fernando Morientes's shot was partially blocked by Barcelona
goalkeeper Ruud Hesp.
	   Barcelona rallied back in the 14th when Dutchman Patrick
Kluivert, acquired from Ajax following the World Cup, scored his
first for the Catalan team.
	   With the boisterous crowd behind them, Madrid applied most of
the pressure during the first half but Barcelona's Rivaldo of
Brazil, struggled, sending shots high and wide or directly into the
hands of Madrid goalkeepter Bodo Illgner.
	   Madrid retook the lead in the 25th when Yugoslav Predraj
Mijatovic settled the ball deep in Barcelona territory and crossed
to Raul, who converted for a 2-1 lead.
	   Barcelona charged back out in the second half, piling on attacks
with several misses until Anderson got the equalizer in the 83rd.

	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Hurricane Georges strengthened
to a category 4 storm Saturday afternoon capable of causing extreme
damage as it bore down on the small islands of the eastern
Caribbean.
	   ``Air Force reconnaissance reports indicate that Georges is now
an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane,'' the National
Hurricane Center in Miami warned.
	   At 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) Saturday, the Hurricane Center in Miami
said Georges was centered at 15.7 north latitude and 54.4 west
longitude, about 450 miles (720 kilometers) east of the Lesser
Antilles.
	   Georges was moving west-northwest at 20 mph (32 kph) and was
expected to begin affecting the easternmost islands Sunday morning
with the center of the storm passing over the islands later in the
day.
	   Georges' sustained winds increased to 145 mph (230 kph)
Saturday, moving it up to category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale,
comparable to Hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of southern
Florida in 1992.
	   The Hurricane Center said storm surge flooding of five to 10
feet (1.5 to 3 meters) above normal tide levels should be expected
along with five to eight inches (13 to 20 centimeters) of rain,
with heavier rainfall possible in some areas.

Michalczewski knocks out Prince in eighth round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OBERHAUSEN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Dariusz Michalczewski
Saturday sent England's Mark Prince's into the ropes with a hard
left in the eighth round to defend his WBO lightheavyweight title.
	   Michalczewski, 38-0, finished off a staggering Prince with the
roundhouse shot to the chin with three seconds left in the round in
his 13th defense.
	   The Polish-born German, who has owned four different world
titles, seconds earlier buckled Prince's knees with a hard right to
the head. The knockout blow spun his opponent around before he fell
face down into the ropes.
	   Prince, now 18-1 with 14 knockouts, fought Michalczewski even
until he walked into a right hand to start the fifth round.
	   By the sixth round, Michalczewski was openly stalking Prince,
who desperately held him off with a flurry of blows.
	   ``I wasn't surprised by the way he hit _ but I thought I could
win anyhow,'' said Prince.
	   Michalczewski, 30, now wants to fight WBC champion Roy Jones Jr.
	   ``I've wanted him for a long time, but that's a matter for the
promoters,'' he said.
	   Prince, who had stopped 11 of his opponents by the third round,
began the fast-paced fight by answering Michalczewski's stiff left
jabs with right hooks to the head.
	   But when the German suddenly began throwing the right, he
stunned Prince almost every time. In the fifth, he opened a cut
above the British fighter's eye.
	   The two fighters slugged it out toe-to-toe at the end of the
fourth round, but afterwards Prince appeared to be slowed down by
the hits he took.
	   Michalczewski briefly owned the WBA, IBF and WBO titles after
beating American Virgil Hill two years, and once owned the WBO
cruiserweight crown.
	   Michalczewski, who earned dlrs 1.4 million for the bout, weighed
79.3 kilos (175 pounds), while Prince was at 78.8 (174 pounds).

Israel heads into holiday on high alert; envoy's visit ends
</HEADLINE>

no breakthrough reported, meeting in New York not ruled out, edits

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An American mediator on Saturday ended his
latest effort to break the 18-month Israeli-Palestinian deadlock,
claiming progress but no real breakthrough.
	   And as so often happens in Israel, tension and fear shadowed
what was supposed to be a festive occasion _ the Jewish New Year's
holiday, beginning at sundown Sunday.
	   In the West Bank _ whose border with Israel was sealed off,
along with that of the Gaza Strip _ thousands of Palestinian
supporters of the radical Islamic group Hamas staged a march
Saturday, burning U.S. and Israeli flags and screaming, ``Revenge,
revenge!''
	   U.S. envoy Dennis Ross was heading back to the United States
after an 11-day visit to the region apparently empty-handed except
for hopes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser
Arafat might try to meet in the United States this week.
	   Ross met for nearly two hours in Gaza with Arafat Saturday night
and told reporters afterward: ``We have made some headway, but
there is still work to be done.''
	   Afterward, he held a final session with Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The prime minister's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said some progress
was made, but provided no details.
	   Arafat said he would have no objection to meeting Netanyahu when
both are in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, but
said no session had been set. Bushinsky, too, said Netanyahu did
not rule out such a meeting, but added that ''we shall see in the
next few days if it is practical.''
	   In the American-brokered talks, the two sides have been trying
to reach agreement on a long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and on revised terms of a Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Ross' departure, set early Sunday, was only hours before the
start of the two-day Rosh Hashana holiday. Commentators agreed that
as the year wound down, things looked inauspicious indeed on the
peace front.
	   ``If it's time for New Year well-wishing, let there be some
realism,'' commentator B. Michael wrote in Friday's editions of the
Yediot Ahronot daily newspaper. ``The chance that the next year
will be a good one is pretty slim.''
	   Israelis mark Rosh Hashana with special prayers and readings,
and the blowing of a ram's horn, or shofar. A traditional treat is
apple slices dipped in honey, symbolizing hopes that the coming
year will be sweet.
	   But bitterness was the overriding theme. The Palestinian
Cabinet, in a statement issued Saturday, blamed Israel for failure
to reach an accord during Ross' visit.
	   ``The mission did not achieve the progress anticipated due to
Israeli procrastination in ... acceptance of the American
initiative,'' said the Cabinet, which met late Friday.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, more than 3,000 supporters of
the radical Islamic group Hamas rallied Saturday, waving green
Hamas flags and singing nationalistic songs. Palestinian police did
not interfere with the march, staged in a Palestinian-controlled
area.
	   ``The blood of our murdered ones will not be wasted!'' said
Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin, addressing the
demonstrators by telephone hookup from Gaza.
	   Hamas has vowed to avenge the Sept. 11 killings of brothers Imad
and Adel Awadallah, top fugitives who were shot dead by Israeli
troops in a bloody raid on their West Bank hideout.
	   Near the West Bank town of Ramallah, Israeli troops and
Palestinian demonstrators fought small-scale skirmishes over
several hours on Saturday. About 20 youths on a highway overpass
outside Ramallah tore down protective fencing meant to keep them
from stoning motorists.
	   ``Allahu akbar _ God is great!'' they shouted as they flung
chunks of stone that slammed into a passing Israeli army jeep.
Soldiers jumped out, guns at the ready, and fired tear gas to
disperse the youths. No injuries were reported.
	   Later, near an Israeli checkpoint south of Ramallah,
Palestinians threw stones at soldiers and burned tires, sending
plumes of black smoke into the air. The official Voice of Palestine
radio said Israeli troops encircled the area.
	   Arafat, meanwhile, accused the Israeli government of condoning
violence by Jewish settlers against Palestinians, and said such
attacks were destroying prospects for peace. A Palestinian youth
was shot dead Thursday by a Jewish settler near the West Bank
village of Beitunia.
	   The settler said he acted in self-defense after his car was
stoned; Palestinians said the shooting was unprovoked. A magistrate
ordered the settler held over until at least Sunday.
	   ``These crimes happen, and we haven't heard any denunciation of
such acts by the Israeli government,'' Arafat told his Cabinet.

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson must be examined by a psychiatrist
before he'll be allowed back into the ring in the state of Nevada,
the Nevada Athletic Commission decided Saturday.
	   The commission will pick three psychiatrists and Tyson will be
able to choose one of them for an examination expected within a
week or so. If the boxer is found mentally fit to fight again, the
commissioners are expected to approve his license. Another hearing
was scheduled for Oct. 3.
	   Tyson was at times testy but ultimately contrite as he pleaded
with the commission that banned him from boxing on July 9, 1997,
after he bit Evander Holyfield's ears in a title bout.
	   Tyson said he was ``so sorry'' and that the ban has left him all
but broke. He promised he was a changed man and would never
misbehave again.
	   ``Trust me, this won't happen anymore,'' he told the
commissioners.
	   ``I believed I was bigger than the sport. I realize now I'm Mike
Tyson the athlete. It brought me down to earth a great deal.''

	   The commissioners, however, want an outside source to determine
whether Tyson is ready to return to the sport he once dominated.
	   ``I believe a medically assisted solution is the fairest
solution to this matter,'' commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem
said. ``We owe it to Mr. Tyson. Anything less, in my opinion, would
be wrong.''
	   Tyson's lawyer, Dale Kinsella, told the commission that the
boxer has lost dlrs 50 million to dlrs 65 million because of the
ban, which has kept him from fighting virtually throughout the
United States. The former heavyweight boxing champ's advisers say
his money troubles may force him to fight overseas if the
commission rejects his application.
	   Tyson's character was also a key issue. When commissioner
Lorenzo Fertitta asked the boxer why he always seemed to be getting
in trouble, Tyson said:
	   ``I'm belligerent sometimes when I'm provoked. I'm tired of
people trying to take advantage of me, trying to bully me around
and antagonize me. It's been pervasive for so many years that I'm a
bad seed.''
	   Tyson is accused of assaulting two men following a minor traffic
accident involving his wife's Rolls Royce in a Washington, D.C.,
suburb. A preliminary hearing is set for Oct. 2. But because the
matter is pending, Kinsella said Tyson would not answer questions
about it.
	   Tyson, who arrived on a red motorcycle wearing a leather jacket
and jeans, sounded annoyed at times during the hearing and at other
times buried his head in his hands as if he were disgusted. At one
point he said he was being ``humiliated.''

Afridi pilots Pakistan to Sahara Cup victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY COZIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO, Canada (AP) _ A boundary filled 109 and opening bowling
spell that limited India to 34 runs in six overs highlighted a
brilliant all-round performance by Shahid Afridi on Saturday that
gave Pakistan a 134-run victory and an unassailable 3-1 lead in the
Sahara Cup.
	   Afridi's batting heroics started a tournament record innings of
316 for six wickets off 50 overs. He then contained the opposing
batsmen with his leg-spin bowling that featured in two runs outs as
India collapsed to 182 all out off 46.3 overs.
	   The result made Sunday's final match meaningless except as a
possible consolation win for India.
	   Pakistan, sent in to bat for the fourth successive time after
Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin won the toss, amassed the
highest team total in the three years of the Sahara Cup.
	   India never made a serious challenge, faltering against spirited
Pakistani bowling.
	   Power-hitting Afridi, a 18-year-old right-hander from Karachi,
hoisted six sixes to the delight of the flag-waving Pakistani
section of a packed, bipartisan crowd of 5,000. He also counted
seven fours in the first individual hundred recorded in the 15
matches since the series started in 1996. It was his second century
in one-day internationals.
	   He dominated a second-wicket partnership of 141 with captain
Aamir Sohail, who scored 46.
	   When Afridi fell to a skied catch to long-off from left-arm
spinner Sunil Joshi, Inzamam ul-Haq and Salim Malik continued the
blitz on the Indian bowlers, adding 103 off 79 balls for the fourth
wicket.
	   Inzamam, Man of the Match in Pakistan's victory in the third
match on Wednesday, hit two sixes and seven fours in 78 off 74
balls and Malik contributed 39 off 36 balls.
	   Joshi was the only Indian bowler to come through the onslaught
relatively unscathed. He took two for 36 off his 10 overs.
	   Medium-pacer Saurav Ganguly, Man of the Match five successive
times over the past two seasons, gave up four sixes and five fours
as he was belted for 62 off five overs.
	   India needed to score at an imposing 6.32 runs an over for the
victory that would level the series. It never progressed at more
than four an over and their disappointed fans streamed out of the
ground long before Pakistan completed its victory.
	   Opener Navjot Sidhu and captain Mohammed Azharuddin kept hope
flickering for India with a third-wicket partnership of 78. But
Sidhu took 76 balls over his 62 and Azharuddin 56 to make 40 as the
Pakistanis did not ease the pressure.
	   The outcome was all but settled when three wickets fell in the
space of 12 runs once Sidhu was stumped off left-arm spinner
Sohail, attempting a big hit. Two were to Afridi's fast and
accurate throwing that ran out Hrishikesh Kanitkar and Rahul Dravid
in successive overs and guaranteed him the Man of the Match award
from former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott.
	   Pakistan's best bowlers were off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq with
three wickets for 20 from nine overs and captain Sohail whose
left-arm spin earned him two for 38 from 10 overs.
	   India are expected to be boosted Sunday by the inclusion of
their best and most celebrated batsman, Sachin Tendulkar, who
arrived in Toronto Saturday. He was previously engaged in the
Commonwealth Games in Malaysia.
	   Pakistan took the inaugural Sahara Cup in 1996, 3-2, and India
won 4-1 last year.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An American mediator on Saturday was wrapping
up his latest effort to break the 18-month Israeli-Palestinian
deadlock, claiming progress but no real breakthrough.
	   And as so often happens in Israel, tension and fear shadowed
what was supposed to be a festive occasion _ the Jewish New Year's
holiday, which begins at sundown Sunday.
	   In the West Bank _ whose border with Israel was sealed off,
along with that of the Gaza Strip _ thousands of Palestinian
supporters of the radical Islamic group Hamas staged a march
Saturday, burning U.S. and Israeli flags and screaming, ``Revenge,
revenge!''
	   U.S. envoy Dennis Ross appeared ready to head back to the United
States empty-handed after an 11-day visit to the region. Ross met
for nearly two hours in Gaza with Arafat Saturday night and told
reporters afterward: ``We have made some headway, but there is
still work to be done.''
	   Afterward, he held a final session with Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The prime minister's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said some progress
was made, but provided no details.

Commission: Tyson must be examined by a psychiatrist

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson must be examined by a psychiatrist
before he'll be allowed back into the ring in the American state of
Nevada, the Nevada Athletic Commission decided Saturday.
	   The commission will pick three psychiatrists and Tyson will be
able to choose one of them for an examination expected within a
week or so. If the boxer is found mentally fit to fight again, the
commissioners are expected to approve his license.
	   Another hearing was scheduled for Oct. 3.
	   ``If they say he's normal and can fight again, then we have the
responsibility to maybe, probably, license him to fight again,''
commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem said.
	   Tyson was at times agitated and hostile but ultimately contrite
in front of the commission that banned him from boxing in its state
_ and virtually the entire United States _ on July 9, 1997, after
he bit Evander Holyfield's ears in a heavyweight title bout.
	   Tyson once again apologized and said the ban has left him all
but broke. He promised he was a changed man and would never
misbehave again.
	   ``Trust me, this won't happen anymore,'' he said.
	   ``I believed I was bigger than the sport. I realize now I'm Mike
Tyson the athlete. It brought me down to earth a great deal.''
	   The commissioners, however, want an outside source to determine
whether Tyson is ready to return to the sport he once dominated.
	   ``I believe a medically assisted solution is the fairest
solution to this matter,'' Ghanem said. ``We owe it to Mr. Tyson.
Anything less, in my opinion, would be wrong.''
	   Tyson's lawyer, Dale Kinsella, told the commission that the
boxer has lost dlrs 50 million to dlrs 65 million because of the
ban. The former heavyweight champ's advisers say his money troubles
may force him to fight overseas if the commission rejects his
application.
	   Tyson's character was also a key issue. When commissioner
Lorenzo Fertitta asked the boxer why he always seemed to be getting
in trouble, Tyson said:
	   ``I'm belligerent sometimes when I'm provoked. I'm tired of
people trying to take advantage of me, trying to bully me around
and antagonize me. It's been pervasive for so many years that I'm a
bad seed.''
	   Tyson is accused of assaulting two men following a minor traffic
accident involving his wife's Rolls-Royce in a Washington, D.C.,
suburb. A preliminary hearing is set for Oct. 2. But because the
matter is pending, Kinsella said Tyson would not answer questions
about it.
	   Tyson, who arrived on a red motorcycle wearing a leather jacket
and jeans, sounded annoyed at times during the hearing and at other
times buried his head in his hands as if he were disgusted. At one
point he said he was being ``humiliated.''
	   He entered the meeting room surrounded by bodyguards and an
entourage of about a dozen people.
	   On a hill next to the building where the hearing was conducted
stood a green, 3-meter (10-foot) sign that said: ``Mike Tyson Is
Still Our Hero.'' Six protesters from the feminist group the
National Organization for Women demonstrated outside the building.
	   Kinsella opened the proceedings by reading a letter from Tyson
to Ghanem.
	   ``I acknowledge that I made a mistake and again I apologize for
it,'' the fighter said in the letter. ``I assure you this kind of
behavior will not repeat itself. Let's put this behind us and allow
boxing to be what it should be, the best sport in the world.''
	   Tyson sat at a table in front of the commissioners as his lawyer
read the letter. Sitting with Tyson were his wife, Monica, and
other lawyers and advisers. The audience included celebrities such
as basketball stars Magic Johnson and Karl Malone.
	   Kinsella told the commission that Tyson has suffered
``financially, massively'' in the 14 months he hasn't been allowed
to fight. The boxer has surrounded himself with a new set of
advisers and lawyers, Kinsella said, meaning he's no longer
associated with promoter Don King and others Tyson feels cheated
him.
	   ``He has significantly changed his life,'' the lawyer said.
	   Kinsella presented a chart to the commissioners that showed
Tyson recieved just dlrs 5.2 million of the dlrs 30 million he was
supposed to earn from the last Holyfield fight. Most of it was lost
to taxes, King's take, and a dlrs 3 million fine for biting the
champion.
	   In addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. federal
government's tax collection agency, has placed a dlrs 13 million
lien on Tyson for upaid taxes, and the boxer is facing an dlrs 8
million judgment to former trainer Kevin Rooney from a civil
lawsuit, which is being appealed.
	   During the discussion of Tyson's finances, the boxer interrupted
the commissioners, saying, ``My life is on trial, so to speak. I'm
not going to allow other people to have nice things and my kids to
starve. You've got to understand I care about my kids.''
	   Commissioner Luther Mack then asked him how many contracts he
had signed in his career, and Tyson snapped, ``Do you really think
I know, sir? Do you know any fighter who can actually say that?''
	   Mack said he wasn't trying to humiliate him.
	   ``You are humiliating me,'' Tyson said.

LAS VEGAS: Tyson said.

<TEXT>
	   Later, psychologist Norton Roitman, who examined Tyson last
month, told the commissioners that the fighter has changed and has
a bright future. He said Tyson is ``sort of desperate to feel
touched and loved.''
	   As the Tyson camp ended its case before the commission, the
boxer gave one final statement.
	   ``Thanks for the opportunity to be here,'' he said. ``For some
reason I feel like Norman Bates up here with all the doctors and
stuff. Trust me, this won't happen anymore. I've learned, man. I'm
sorry, I'm so sorry.''
	   Norman Bates is a serial murder character from the Alfred
Hitchcock film Pyscho.
	   Tyson's application in Nevada comes two months after he applied
in eastern state of New Jersey, which was seen as an attempt to get
around the ban.
	   New Jersey and Nevada are popular venues for boxing due to its
casino gambling industry.
	   The boxer withdrew that application last month, the night before
the New Jersey commission was to issue its decision.
	   Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel apologized to the commissioners
Saturday for going to New Jersey, saying it was his idea.
``Hopefully, this will not be held against us,'' he said.
	   If Tyson gets his license back he could fight again in the
United States before the end of the year. Rejection would mean
another year on the sidelines _ at least in Nevada and the states
that honor its suspension _ and threaten a career that was fading
even before he bit Holyfield.
	   Tyson reportedly has had offers from promoters in other
countries to fight for lucrative purses, money he needs despite
having made more than dlrs 100 million in the ring in the two years
before the last Holyfield fight.
	   Other states have so far honored Nevada's ban on Tyson, and
would probably continue to do so if he were denied a license.

Summerhays in five-way tie at Kroger Senior Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERRY KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Bruce Summerhays landed one drive on a cart
path and the next in a creek, but managed to salvage a share of the
lead Saturday after two rounds of the dlrs 1.1 million Kroger
Senior Classic.
	   ``It was a Jekyll and Hyde type of round,'' said Summerhays, who
shot 69 over the 6,639-yard (5,975-meter), par-70 Grizzly Course at
The Golf Center just north of Cincinnati.
	   That dropped Summerhays, who took a two-stroke lead into
Saturday's round, into a five-way tie at 7-under 133 with Bob
Charles, Frank Conner, Larry Nelson and Hugh Baiocchi. Five other
players were one stroke behind.
	   Summerhays had three bogeys in a five-hole stretch on the back
side.
	   ``At 9 under, I really felt comfortable with my swing at the
turn,'' he said. ``I said, `Let's just keep cruising, hitting those
greens and fairways.' But I didn't maintain my rhythm.''
	   He had to take a free drop off the cart path on No. 13, which
put him behind a tree and led to a bogey. The drop after hitting
into a creek on the right side of the 14th fairway cost him another
stroke.
	   ``My glass is half full, not half empty,'' he said. ``I'm very
happy to be where I am.''
	   Summerhays, 54, won the State Farm Senior Classic in July at
Columbia, Maryland, for his second U.S. senior tour title. The
former club pro and golf coach at Stanford University also was the
first-round leader last week in Indianapolis, but ended up second
behind Hugh Baiocchi.
	   Charles and Conner shot 64, the best rounds of the day, to equal
Summerhays' opening round. Nelson and Baiocchi shot 66.
	   Charles not only moved into contention in the tournament but won
the MasterCard Champions 36-hole tournament-within-a-tournament for
players 60 and over.
	   He edged Harold Henning by one stroke for the dlrs 18,000 first
prize and the possibility of much more in the main tournament.
	   ``Let's worry about one thing at a time,'' Charles said.
	   Charles has played the best of anybody over the past 28 holes.
	   ``After eight holes yesterday, I made a deliberate effort to
slow my swing down, to get a better rhythm and better tempo,'' he
said.
	   Larry Nelson, sidelined the past seven weeks by a herniated
disc, said he has played better than he expected, although his
putting let him down Saturday.
	   ``Yesterday I hit eight greens and shot 67; today I hit 18
greens and shot 66,'' Nelson said. ``So I improved my score one
shot by hitting 10 more greens. Tomorrow I hope to put it all
together.''
	   Twenty players were within three shots of the lead going into
Sunday's final round.
	   Defending champion Jay Sigel headed a group of seven players at
136. Sigel shot a 63 last year and had a tournament-record 18-under
195 when the Grizzly course played to a par of 71.

Fleisher takes B.C. Open lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ENDICOTT, New York (AP) _ Bruce Fleisher said time had passed
him by. One month shy of his 50th birthday, maybe it has, but not
on Saturday at the B.C. Open.
	   Fleisher briefly put any thoughts of graduating from the regular
to the U.S. Senior PGA Tour on hold with a 9-under-par 63 and
gained the third-round lead at 12-under 204. That was one shot
better than Nolan Henke, who shot a 67 Saturday.
	   Chris Perry, second here last year, had a 69 and was alone in
third at 206, while rookie Richard Coughlan of Ireland and R.W.
Eaks were tied for fourth, another shot back.
	   Third-round leader Dave Barr of Canada had an off day with a 73
and led a group of six players at 208. Defending B.C. Open champion
Gabriel Hjertstedt of Sweden also was in contention after a 66
moved him within five strokes of the lead.
	   Three decades ago, Fleisher was dreaming of life on the American
PGA Tour after winning the U.S. Amateur title. Now he's staring at
life on tour as a senior, and that's not so bad.
	   ``I've been around a long time, but I can still play,'' said
Fleisher, who took advantage of the firm playing conditions on the
En-Joie Golf Club course for seven birdies and an eagle that got
him going.
	   ``I'm competitive, but that's why there is a senior tour. My
peers are out there. I'm looking forward to it. I'm looking forward
to the no-cut. This year I've missed eight cuts by one shot, and it
seems like every week I'm always around that cut. That's stressful.
	   ``I'm not putting a lot of heat on myself this week,'' said
Fleisher, whose only American tour victory came at the 1991 New
England Classic. ``It's certainly not life and death for me. It's
life and death for the 25-year-olds. I've done that, been there.''
	   So, too, has the 33-year-old Henke, who won the 1990 B.C. Open
in only his second full year on tour. He had four birdies on the
front nine to quickly sneak up the leaderboard, then managed to
save par on the final two holes after pulling his last two tee
shots.
	   ``That doesn't give me a lot of good vibes going into Sunday,''
Henke said. ``I hadn't drove the ball that great this week, but I
drove it a lot better today, so I'm not that worried about two
little pulls. I'll just try to forget about it.''
	   Perhaps the biggest surprise in a weekend of surprises was the
24-year-old Coughlan, who graduated from Clemson only last year.
Because of early morning fog, Friday's second round was delayed 90
minutes, and 22 players were stranded on the course when darkness
fell. Coughlan was one of them, which meant Saturday was a long
day.
	   ``I don't like going back out to finish one or two holes in the
morning because you get out of your groove,'' said Coughlan, who
was awake at 4:30 a.m. and shot a 5-under 67 on Saturday. ``I'm
just trying to keep the ball rolling. I feel confident in so far as
I'm playing good. I know what I'm doing well. But it's the last
round of a tour event, and I never thought I'd be out here with
these big boys so soon.''

Americans' late heroics build big Solheim lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Completes day's play. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) _ Juli Inkster made clutch shots down the
stretch of two matches Saturday as the United States built a
five-point lead over Europe heading into singles showdowns at the
Solheim Cup.
	   The U.S. team, which won five of the eight points available on
Saturday, held a 10 1-2 to 5 1-2 lead going into Sunday's 12
singles matches.
	   At the last Solheim Cup, in 1996 in Wales, the United States
trailed by two points but won nine of the 12 singles and halved two
others for a 17-11 victory.
	   In Saturday morning's foursomes, or alternate-shot, matches the
U.S. team won three of four points to take an 8 1-2 to 3 1-2 lead.
	   The Europeans won two of the first three afternoon foursome, or
better-ball, matches, but Inkster saved the day to give the United
States some breathing room.
	   Inkster and Meg Mallon took a 1-up lead with a par at 14, then
fought off a European charge. Liselotte Neumann, playing with
fellow Swede Charlotta Sorenstam, almost holed her approach at the
par-4 17th.
	   But Inkster ended the European comeback when she rolled in a
9-meter (30-foot) birdie putt as the sun was setting at Muirfield
Village Golf Club.
	   Europe also won a close afternoon match, and each side had a
lopsided decision.
	   Lisa Hackney, who had a birdie putt spin around the edge of the
cup and out at No. 12, sunk a 3-meter (10-foot) putt at 15 to give
her and fellow Englishwoman Laura Davies the lead for good.
	   Needing to win the final hole to halve the match, the U.S. team
couldn't do anything right. Tammie Green found a fairway bunker off
the tee and had to blast out, then hit a wedge 4 1-2 meters (15
feet) below the hole. She left her par putt short.
	   Teammate Chris Johnson almost hit her drive into a creek to the
left and her low approach bounced into the bunker fronting the 18th
green. She failed to get out with her first attempt and picked up.
	   In the meantime, both Hackney and Davies lagged their long putts
and had short but difficult putts for par, but they were conceded
along with the 1-up match victory.
	   Annika Sorenstam, ranked No. 1 in the world, evened her record
at 2-2 for the week by pairing with another Swede, Catrin Nilsmark,
to win 5 and 3 over Betsy King and Rosie Jones. The loss was King's
first in better-ball play after winning five and halving the other
match in her four previous Solheim appearances.
	   Sorenstam, who has won four times on the U.S. LPGA tour this
year, hit a wedge on the par-4 13th well short of the hole and it
kept rolling all the way across the green to within a meter (3
feet). Her birdie was the first in a string of three of her own
that closed out the Americans, including putts of 1 and 3 meters (3
and 9 feet) on the next two holes.
	   Donna Andrews and Sherri Steinhauer of the United States teamed
to beat Marie-Laure de Lorenzi of France and Helen Alfredsson of
Sweden 4 and 3 _ their second lopsided victory of the day.
	   Andrews had five birdies in a seven-hole stretch _ and six for
the day _ when she rolled in a 3 1-2-meter (12-foot) putt at the
12th hole.
	   Andrews was so hot that the only hole Steinhauer's score was
needed was when she had a birdie at the par-3 8th.
	   In the morning alternate-shot matches, the United States trailed
after 11 holes in three matches yet won two of them.
	   Davies and Charlotta Sorenstam never trailed in winning an early
point for the European side with a 3 and 2 victory over Mallon and
Brandie Burton.
	   However, that was it for the Europeans.
	   First-day hero Dottie Pepper and Inkster never led until they
birdied the 15th hole in their match with Alfredsson and de
Lorenzi. The Europeans won the next hole with a par and both sides
parred 17 _ the match and the point coming down to the closing
hole.
	   The Europeans failed to get up and down from the deep grass
above the left front bunker, while Inkster lagged a 12-meter
(40-foot) putt from the back of the green to within a half meter
(18 inches). After Alfredsson barely missed her 5 1-2-meter
(18-foot) par putt, Europe conceded the hole and the match, 1-up.
	   Kelly Robbins and Pat Hurst, 2-down through 10 holes, pulled
level with a birdie at 14 and took the lead for good with a par at
16. They halved the final two holes for the 1-up victory _ Hurst
locking up the victory by hitting a clutch 2-meter (6-foot) par
putt.
	   Andrews and Steinhauer also pulled off a surprisingly easy 3 and
2 victory over Annika Sorenstam and Catriona Matthew.
	   The United States needs 14 of the 28 possible points to retain
the cup, while Europe needs 14 1-2 points to take it away.
	   Each match is worth a point, with all 12 players from each side
playing in Sunday's singles matches.

Hurricane watches posted in eastern Caribbean as Georges nears

	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Hurricane Georges strengthened
to an ``extremely dangerous'' Category 4 storm Saturday, capable of
causing severe damage as its 145-mph (235-kph) winds bore down on
the small islands of the eastern Caribbean.
	   Georges was moving west-northwest at 20 mph (32 kph) and was
expected to begin affecting the easternmost islands Sunday morning,
with the center of the storm passing over the islands later in the
day.
	   At 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) Saturday, Georges was about 450 miles
(725 kph) east of the Lesser Antilles, the National Hurricane
Center in Miami said.
	   ``Georges is now an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane,''
the center warned.
	   Hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of southern Florida in
1992, was a Category 4 storm.
	   The Hurricane Center predicted storm-surge flooding of 5 feet to
10 feet (1.5 to 3 meters) above normal tide levels along with 5
inches to 8 inches (12 centimeters to 20 centimeters) of rain, with
heavier rainfall possible in some areas.
	   Residents of the small, eastern Caribbean islands were taking
Georges seriously: Under sunny skies in Dominica, the usually busy
Saturday markets were more active than usual as residents stocked
up on necessities and fishermen hauled their boats from the water.
	   In the neighboring French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe,
forecasters urged residents to prepare.
	   ``This is a hurricane big enough that people should remain very
vigilant and should not think that our island will be completely
spared by Georges,'' warned forecaster Danielle Decan on Radio
Caraibes in Martinique.
	   The Federal Emergency Management Agency sent health care
workers, engineers, firefighters and other professionals to the
U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico ahead of the storm.
	   France's deputy minister for overseas territories, Jean-Jack
Queyranne, sent 40 public service officers to both Martinique and
Guadeloupe.
	   At 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT), the Hurricane Center extended the
hurricane watch to Puerto Rico. Watches had already been issued for
the entire northeastern rim of the Caribbean from St. Lucia in the
south to the U.S. Virgin Islands in the north.

Report Saddam aide defected to Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An aide to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has
defected and described to British and American intelligence
officials Iraq's oil smuggling arrangements with Iran, The Sunday
Telegraph reported.
	   Sami Salih, described by the newspaper as the man who
``masterminded'' the sanctions-busting oil smuggling network,
defected to Britain with his wife and four children earlier this
year, it said.
	   Salih, 38, had been accused of spying and was arrested and
tortured by Saddam's guards before escaping from prison, the
newspaper said. He is now reportedly in hiding in Belgium with his
family.
	   The newspaper said Salih has also given the intelligence
services details of the layout of the presidential palace complex
on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates.
	   Despite the enmity that led Iran and Iraq to fight a war from
1980 to 1988, the Iranians agreed to help Iraq avoid the sanctions
the United Nations imposed after the Gulf War to force Saddam to
give up his weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Sunday Telegraph said the Iranians took a cut of the black
market oil profits and that both sides used the proceeds to buy
weapons
	   In May, U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said that
Iran, after brief attempts to help enforce the sanctions, was again
allowing ships smuggling Iraqi oil to pass through its territorial
waters.
	   He also said Iraq's refusal to allow the U.N. to monitor the
sales ``strongly suggests that the proceeds from these sales are
intended very clearly for nonhumanitarian purposes.''
	   The Sunday Telegraph said the deal was negotiated at the highest
level of the Iranian regime. Both the Iraqis and Iranians worked
through front companies and by 1996, when Salih was arrested, the
trade was earning about dlrs 1 million per day for each country,
the report said.
	   It said the Iraqi profits were deposited in bank accounts in
Amman, Jordan, and that the funds were used to finance Saddam's
regime and to purchase arms and military supplies. After Salih's
arrest, the companies were controled by Saddam's sons Uday and
Qusay, then shut down.
	   ``The companies might have gone, but the trade still
continues,'' Salih was quoted as saying.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ With more than 120 people still
missing Saturday, maritime officials puzzled over why a Philippine
passenger ferry with 430 people aboard began tilting in a storm and
then quickly sank. By late Saturday, 14 were confirmed dead, the
coast guard said. The Princess of the Orient had been rocked by
strong waves and winds, but should have been able to withstand much
worse weather, officials said. Passengers and crew among the 294
people rescued Saturday said the ship sank in less than an hour _
highly unusual for a vessel with no apparent damage. The local
governor appealed in a radio broadcast for help in rescuing people
still floating in the chilly, storm-whipped water. Carlos Go, chief
executive officer of Sulpicio Lines, the owner of the 24-year-old
ship, insisted it was in seaworthy condition despite an on board
fire in 1997. (PHILIPPINES-SHIP)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank's program to jump-start the
country's paralyzed banking system has already opened the way for
some banks to pay their debts, a bank official said Saturday.
Reviving the commercial banks' activities is one of the priorities
Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, has set for his
economic crisis-fighting government. The economy has been at a
near-standstill after the events of the past month, during which
the nation's currency has been devalued, the country has defaulted
on its loans and has changed governments. Primakov, who was
confirmed by parliament on Sept. 11, has yet to name his whole
Cabinet. Commercial banks in particular have been brought to the
brink of bankruptcy, and their virtual shutdown for the past two
weeks has brought other commercial activities to a standstill.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bavarian police have arrested a man
described as a close associate of international terrorist Osama bin
Laden, the state Justice Ministry said Saturday. Officials did not
release the identity of the man. They said he was arrested
Wednesday afternoon near Munich on a tip from Interpol officials in
Washington. The ministry said it would confirm the man's identity
this week and determine what he was doing in Germany. Bavarian
Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein told German television the man
had arrived in Munich from Sudan. Beckstein said he would seek to
extradite the suspect to the United States as quickly as possible.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ One top White House aide keeps tabs on almost
40 Democratic lawmakers, a third of whom privately say President
Bill Clinton should leave office. Just as many want him censured;
the remaining few are supporters. Every day, this aide calls the
Capitol Hill offices of the wavering, and, in one way or another,
asks: ``What can I do to keep you from bolting?'' Like a boy
holding back the sea with his finger in the dike, White House
officials are scrambling to prevent Democratic defections. Two
House members of Clinton's party already have called for his
resignation over the Monica Lewinsky inquiry, and aides fear more
desertions. Yet there is no fancy strategy or silver bullet
guaranteed to save the president, no ``battle plan'' or ``war
room.'' Instead, White House officials say it's more like a street
fight; they act on instinct, fighting skirmish after skirmish on
the enemy's terms. (US-CLINTON-STRATEGY)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An American mediator on Saturday was wrapping
up his latest effort to break the 18-month Israeli-Palestinian
deadlock, claiming progress but no real breakthrough. And as so
often happens in Israel, tension and fear shadowed what was
supposed to be a festive occasion _ the Jewish New Year's holiday,
which begins at sundown Sunday. In the West Bank _ whose border
with Israel was sealed off, along with that of the Gaza Strip _
thousands of Palestinian supporters of the radical Islamic group
Hamas staged a march Saturday, burning U.S. and Israeli flags and
screaming, ``Revenge, revenge!'' U.S. envoy Dennis Ross appeared
ready to head back to the United States empty-handed after an
11-day visit to the region. Ross met for nearly two hours in Gaza
with Arafat Saturday night and told reporters afterward: ``We have
made some headway, but there is still work to be done.''

<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (AP) _ South African President Nelson
Mandela's honorary law degree from Harvard puts him in heady
company.
	   Mandela, 80, is one of only three people to receive an honorary
degree from Harvard at a time other than the university's
commencement exercises. The others were George Washington in 1776
and Winston Churchill in 1943.
	   The honor ``holds great symbolic significance to the mind and to
the future memory of this great American institution _ the name of
an African is now added to those two illustrious leaders,'' Mandela
said to a standing ovation of more than 8,000 people in Harvard
Yard on Friday.
	   Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison in a fight against
apartheid and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, accepted the
degree and then called for an end to economic disparities
worldwide.
	   Where there is hunger and suffering, ``talk of democracy ... can
ring hollow and erode confidence in exactly those values we seek to
promote,'' Mandela said.
	   ___
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Nobel Prize-winning author Wole Soyinka isn't
ready to end his self-imposed exile, even though Nigerian
authorities have dropped treason charges against him.
	   Soyinka was charged with treason in March 1997. Authorities
under former dictator Sani Abacha claimed he and 14 others were
behind a series of bombings.
	   Soyinka, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, fled to
the United States in 1995, fearing he was about to be arrested.
	   Since Abacha's death in June, military ruler Abdulsalami
Abubakar has freed hundreds of political prisoners, scheduled
elections and promised a return to civilian rule. Abubakar dropped
the charges against the 15 people, saying it was an effort to
reconcile.
	   Soyinka, who teaches at Emory University, said in Saturday's
editions of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that ``the right thing
has been done.''
	   But, he said, he won't return home until a security decree
allowing people to be arrested without a charge is revoked.
	   ___
	   ARLINGTON, Virginia (AP) _ Director Steven Spielberg has
received the Army's highest civilian decoration for ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' his gritty depiction of American soldiers in combat
during World War II.
	   Army Secretary Louis Caldera presented Spielberg with the
Distinguished Civilian Service Award on Thursday and lauded him for
``reminding Americans of the sacrifices that soldiers make to
defend our country.''
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen said he left his viewing of the
movie in silence, struck by its profound impact.
	   ``It drives a cold steel spike into our very souls,'' Cohen
said.
	   Spielberg turned recognition instead to the World War II
soldiers who fought for the freedom of future generations.
	   ``The real decorations are reserved for all those kids who 56
years ago left home for the very first time, traveled thousand and
thousands of miles away ... to fight there, die there and survive
there so that today we could live as free people in an almost free
world,'' he said.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ South African first lady Graca Machel visited
Hale House in Harlem on Saturday, where one of its founders
announced an exchange program to train South African health care
workers.
	   Five toddlers greeted Machel as she arrived at the home for
malnourished, drug-addicted and HIV-positive infants.
	   Among the children Machel and Sisulu visited were three orphaned
siblings, whose parents, natives of Nigeria, died of AIDS.
	   ``Our region _ South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe _ is becoming
very affected with this (AIDS) problem,'' Machel said. ``We have so
many things in common when it comes to holistic health care. We
have to learn, we need to learn.''
	   Hale House co-founder Dr. Lorraine Hale invited Machel to send
four South African health-care professionals to learn Hale House's
holistic methods. A spokeswoman for the first lady said the
specifics of the exchange would be developed.
	   Hale House planned to offer the trainees transportation and
housing stipends while they are in the United States, said
spokesman Jesse DeVore.
	   ___
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago (AP) _ Miss Universe Wendy
Fitzwilliam will be right at home when she gives away her crown
next year, as her home nation of Trinidad and Tobago was chosen to
host the 1999 pageant.
	   Trade and Tourism Minister Mervyn Assam made the announcement at
a news conference Saturday, saying that Trinidad and Tobago had bid
dlrs 3 million to host the pageant.
	   Fitzwilliam's reign as Miss Universe helped the Caribbean
country win out over other contenders such as Mexico, Jamaica and
Israel, even though it did not make the highest bid, said Assam.
	   He said he expects the country's tourism industry to benefit
from the international exposure, as a television audience of more
than 2 billion persons is expected.

At last, Hollywood listens to Orson Welles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY348 &QL; 
 &UR; By HILLEL ITALIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Hollywood has discovered a new box-office star:
Orson Welles.
	   A re-edited version of ``Touch of Evil,'' first released in
1958, is playing to sold-out theaters in New York, Los Angeles and
at the Toronto International Film Festival. The director's
charismatic thriller about corruption and decadence in a Texas
border town will be opening nationwide throughout the fall.
	   The return of ``Touch of Evil'' is a rare, and posthumous,
Hollywood victory for Welles. The film originally was dumped on the
market by Universal Studios as part of a double feature. It was
seen in a cut down version and given little publicity despite a
cast that featured some of the era's biggest stars _ Charlton
Heston, Janet Leigh and Marlene Dietrich.
	   The return is also a tribute to Universal, which finally put out
Welles' film the way he wanted it.
	   ``The feeling I got was that this was done on their part as
'Let's do something honorable,''' the project's producer, Rick
Schmidlin, said of the executives at Universal. ``All that they
were concerned about was that they would make their money back, not
that they would make a big profit.''
	   Cut to 96 minutes when first released, ``Touch of Evil'' now
runs 111 minutes and its once-disjointed plot is far easier to
follow. The new version was edited by Walter Murch, who won Academy
Awards both for film editing and sound mixing of ``The English
Patient.'' The film scholar and critic Jonathan Rosenbaum was hired
as a consultant.
	   ``Touch of Evil'' continues the restoration of both the movies
and the reputation of Welles, who died in 1985. A victim of poor
funding, studio politics and a rather eclectic attention span,
Welles was seen for much of his life as an undisciplined genius who
never grew beyond his early success. His career after ``Citizen
Kane'' was defined by unfinished films, badly edited films or films
of near-primitive production standards.
	   ``The studios, the brass, the money people _ they were down on
him,'' Leigh said.
	   ``In school, some of the best students were the most disruptive
because they were bored. They're so far ahead of what's being
taught and shown, they just act out. He knew he was right. He had
already shown that with `Citizen Kane.' It was so perfect and right
on and acclaimed so widely that it was too much for the rest of
Hollywood.''
	   But as Welles predicted not long before he died, the industry
would learn to love him once he was gone. Over the past few years,
such Welles films as ``Othello'' and ``F for Fake'' have been
re-released to great acclaim. Schmidlin is trying to get funding
for an unfinished film, ``The Other Side of the Wind,'' which
starred Welles and John Huston, and efforts are being made to
restore the Shakespearean production, ``Chimes at Midnight.''
	   The new version of ``Touch of Evil'' arrived soon after two
other major posthumous projects were announced. Patrick Hemingway
revealed that he had edited a fictional memoir left unpublished by
his late father and academics in England and the United States said
they would use computer programs to resolve contradictions in the
manuscripts of ``The Canterbury Tales.''
	   But the problem with finishing, or refinishing, a past work is
that no one _ professors, computer scientists, relatives of the
deceased _ has ever been able to read the mind of a dead genius.
It's easy to imitate the style of Ernest Hemingway, but the spirit
was the author's alone.
	   The production team for ``Touch of Evil'' didn't have Welles,
but it did have something close _ a recently discovered 58-page
memo he wrote immediately after seeing a studio cut. The director
gave detailed suggestions on everything from camera shots to sound
to the placement of credits. Putting the new print together became
less about interpretation and more about simply following
instructions.
	   ``I cried, I was so happy,'' Leigh said after seeing the new
version. ``It had the bite. It had the roughness. It was like deja
vu; we were seeing what they actually shot.''
	   When Welles signed on for ``Touch of Evil,'' he had been out of
Hollywood for 10 years. Most of his studio films after ``Citizen
Kane'' flopped and by the late 1940s Welles had moved to Europe and
was appearing in as many films as he could to raise money for his
own work.
	   He first joined ``Touch of Evil'' as an actor, but when Heston
learned of his involvement he insisted Welles also be allowed to
direct. Welles, anxious to make a comeback in Hollywood, quickly
transformed what had been an ordinary crime story into one of his
most innovative and daring movies.

TORONTO: daring movies.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The casting alone was inspired to the point of hallucination:
Heston as a Mexican narcotics investigator; Marlene Dietrich as a
gypsy madam; Mercedes McCambridge as a lesbian Mexican gang leader;
Zsa Zsa Gabor as a nightclub owner; Dennis Weaver as a trembling
hotel manager. Welles, who played a crooked American police chief,
wore heavy makeup and a fake nose and added padding to his already
substantial midsection.
	   Filmed in sweaty, shadowy black and white, ``Touch of Evil'' was
marked by blunt references to drugs and sex and politics. Those who
only know Heston as Hollywood's most vocal conservative might be
surprised to hear his character warning that ``a policeman's job is
only easy in a police state.''
	   But the real breakthrough was in the look and in the sound.
Welles helped introduce a technique known as ``worldizing,'' in
which the music is deliberately recorded poorly so it will sound
more realistic. The long, seamless camera shot that opens the film
has been a favorite of directors and was imitated by Robert Altman
at the beginning of ``The Player.''
	   When Universal executives saw the completed film, however, they
were both confused and concerned. With Welles off in Mexico trying
to direct an adaptation of ``Don Quixote,'' several cuts were made
and additional scenes were filmed. Few of the recommendations in
Welles' memo were used and the version released was both more
confusing and less provocative.
	   The film flopped in the United States and got mixed reviews. As
had become typical, Welles' work received a better reception in
Europe. ``Touch of Evil'' quickly became a favorite of such young
filmmakers as Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. Edits and all,
it became, after ``Citizen Kane,'' Welles' most celebrated movie.
	   Welles, meanwhile, never again directed a movie in Hollywood.
	   And he never did finish ``Don Quixote.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ There is a hole in this story, and his name is
Jerome David Salinger.
	   He wrote a few short stories and a novel that shook lives _
``Catcher in the Rye'' _ and then he shut the world out. Since
1965, he has published nothing and said little, rebuffing efforts
to pierce his wall of silence.
	   But in 1972, when he was 53, he sent a fan letter to an
18-year-old college freshman who had written an article in The New
York Times Magazine. Within months, they were living together.
Months later, he broke off their relationship.
	   That would have been the end of it, except that Joyce Maynard
was fated to become the anti-Salinger _ as open as he is secretive,
exposing her own life again and again in print.
	   ``Of all the 18-year-olds in America that J.D. Salinger could
have written to ... he invited into his life a person who was
almost destined sometime or another to find her way out of the mist
and sit down at a typewriter,'' Ms. Maynard says.
	   And she did. Less than half of her new book, ``At Home in the
World,'' is devoted to her time with Salinger, but in those 138
pages she tells more about him than has been revealed since the
Eisenhower administration.
	   If the entire book was even 15 percent as bad as a Vanity Fair
excerpt, ``it will bid fair to be the worst book ever written:
smarmy, whiny, smirky and, above all, almost indescribably
stupid,'' wrote Jonathan Yardley of the Washington Post.
	   ``Just because we are dying to know, does that mean we have a
right to know?'' Elizabeth Gluck wrote in Time magazine. ``Maynard
may have written this story because she needed to. But she
published it because someone was willing to pay her to do so. And
that is not reason enough.''
	   But Ms. Maynard is steadfast. This is her story, she insists.
	   The market for her book would have been smaller had it not
involved Salinger, she acknowledges, but ``it would still be a good
story.'' She did not consider writing but not publishing the book:
``I have a family to support, and I make no apologies about that.''
	   She says her book is drawing attention because it provides the
first Salinger fragments ``in a long time. Like fragments from the
Titanic.'' And as for Salinger's privacy? ``If you want to lead a
totally private life, I don't think that you should be writing
letters to 18-year-old girls.''
	   That is what happened to Ms. Maynard. She was attending Yale
when her picture _ brown-haired, big-eyed, anorexic thin _ appeared
on the cover of the Times Magazine. It accompanied her story,
``Looking Back: An Eighteen Year Old Reflects on Life.''
	   This first memoir was full of majestic pronouncements about her
generation (``I made up this all-American everygirl'') but it did
not mention her alcoholic father, a professor and frustrated
painter. Or her mother, who gave up an academic career to breathe
for her children.
	   The story drew hundreds of letters, but the one from Salinger
stood out. Ms. Maynard had not even read ``Catcher in the Rye'' at
this point, but she knew about Salinger, about his celebrity and
his seclusion.
	   A correspondence started, and then there were phone calls. He
told her that they were ``landsmen,'' a Yiddishism meaning that
they were from the same place, soul mates. Finally, she quit school
and moved in with him.
	   The portrait of Salinger that emerges in ``At Home in the
World'' is of a crank. Ms. Maynard's Salinger is a control freak.
He is obsessed with homeopathic medicine; a strange diet consisting
of nuts, cheese, vegetables and ground lamb patties cooked at 150
degrees Fahrenheit (65.5 Celsius) (he taught her how to induce
vomiting after eating foods that were deemed unhealthy); the
treacheries of publishing and of fame.
	   The book details their problematic sex life, and the
disintegration of their relationship. Salinger disapproved of Ms.
Maynard's desire for celebrity, her willingness to put her picture
on the jacket of the book-length version of ``Looking Back.'' The
covers of his books are plain.
	   After eight months, Ms. Maynard says, during a trip to Florida
with his children, Salinger told her they were through. She should
go to the New Hampshire house, remove her belongings, and be gone.
	   This is not the end of Ms. Maynard's book. It goes on to
describe her marriage, an abortion, her divorce, a forcible sexual
encounter, her parents' deaths, her children's lives and more.
	   She has covered much of this material before. For Ms. Maynard,
it has been suggested, the unpublished life is not worth living.
This is, after all, a woman who wrote about having her breasts
augmented, and then wrote about having her breast implants removed.
	   She writes about her life, she says, because she knows it best.
As a child of an alcoholic whose affliction was never discussed,
she grew too accustomed to secrets.
	   ``One review of the book said, `Joyce Maynard is shameless.'
That's true! I decided to give shame up, and what a relief it was.
I can reveal regret and sadness and even dismay, but I am not a bad
person.''

NEW YORK: bad person.''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Through the years, she has drawn a fierce base of fans, some of
whom have become friends and active participants in her life.
	   When she needed a place to get away and write the book, readers
lent her a house. When she needed a place to meet the press in New
York, readers put her up in the Essex House on Central Park South.
	   She has her own Web site (www.joycemaynard.com). There, fans can
read about Joyce and chat with and about Joyce. Most support Ms.
Maynard's decision to tell all about Salinger.
	   ``The story in question is not Salinger's story to tell or
quell. It's Joyce's story,'' writes DeanQ.
	   ``Isn't the reason people object to Joyce's revelations about
Salinger ... that he does not conform to what they want him to be?
And why shouldn't she be able to tell her story after the shabby
treatment she received from a predatory male?'' asks mick.
	   Occasionally, the critics are heard. ``I knew a guy who worked
at a crematorium and stole gold out of the teeth of the bodies and
ashes ... he saw nothing wrong with that,'' writes Holden. ``I used
to think I'd pass his number on to the police, but hey, he's
single, maybe JM would like him?''
	   In fact, Salinger's fans are all over the Web _ every bit as
devoted as Ms. Maynard's and more numerous, though he encourages
them not at all. If Ms. Maynard is celebrated for her willingness
to invite readers into her messy life, Salinger is revered for his
purity of vision and his refusal to open up.
	   Salinger has written for more than 30 years but refuses to
publish. When quotes from his works were reprinted on Web sites,
Salinger unleashed his literary agents, Harold Ober Associates, to
order them removed.
	   In Cornish, New Hampshire, his neighbors respect Salinger's
choices, and have no respect for Ms. Maynard's.
	   ``What she's doing is despicable,'' said state Rep. Peter
Burling. ``We certainly aren't going to open any doors to folks
that are attracted here because of that book. If anything, we'll
probably be a little tighter lipped.''
	   Orange ``No Trespassing'' signs are nailed to nearly every tree
on the dirt road to Salinger's house. The man who lives inside, Ms.
Maynard says, speaks with the voice of his most famous creation,
Holden Caulfield.
	   It is Holden, in ``Catcher in the Rye,'' who says he would
``pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes. That way I wouldn't have
to have any ... stupid useless conversations with anybody.''
	   Ms. Maynard does not understand why the world goes along.
	   ``A man kind of dictates the rules about how he is to be
treated, and for 30 years, people do what he says. I can't think of
another public figure _ and he IS a public figure _ who has been
allowed to do that. He's not a monster, but he's not a god. He's a
man.''

At the Movies: 'One True Thing'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: film opened Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB THOMAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Ellen Gulden works as an investigative reporter
for New York magazine and is hot on the trail of a U.S. senator
tainted with scandal. Ambitious and talented, she loves her job and
the Manhattan apartment she shares with her boyfriend. But now a
family crisis forces her to move back to her hometown and face the
parents she has never understood.
	   Adapted by Karen Croner from Anna Quindlen's novel, ``One True
Thing'' goes beyond the responsibilities of sons and daughters to
the previous generation. It also poses the question: Do we really
know what kind of people our parents were?
	   The care of ill parents concerns a growing number of Americans.
Never has the issue been presented with greater sensitivity than in
``One True Thing,'' a film by Carl Franklin.
	   When Ellen (Renee Zellweger) sullenly returns to Langhorne, she
seems to enter the time warp of a Frank Capra town. Everything
looks freshly scrubbed, the citizens are cheerful and guileless.
	   The situation at home disturbs Ellen. Her mother Kate (Meryl
Streep) seems almost pitiful in her devotion to a ladies' clique
dedicated to making holidays enjoyable for the town's kids. To
Ellen, Kate appears the quintessential cake-baking,
Christmas-tree-decorating housewife and mother.
	   College professor George Gulden (William Hurt) is perceived by
his daughter as cold, aloof, more devoted to midterms than his
wife's care. Ellen suspects that his relationships with female
students are more than academic.
	   Less visible is Ellen's brother Brian (Tom Everett Scott), who
has flunked out of Harvard and fears his father's wrath.
	   The elements of ``One True Thing'' might fit into a TV
movie-of-the-week, except that it is flawlessly acted, and directed
and written with rare insight.
	   Choosing Franklin as director required imagination, since his
previous films had been hard-bitten crime tales, ``One False Move''
and ``Devil in a Blue Dress.'' He comes through brilliantly,
touching the heart in scene after scene.
	   As the ailing wife and mother, Miss Streep delivers an
astonishing performance, among the best in a superlative career. At
first Kate seems frivolous in her devotion to making Halloween
costumes and Christmas decorations. Later Ellen perceives a wisdom
that she never suspected in her mother. Save another Oscar berth
for Miss Streep.
	   Hurt's self-absorbed college professor offers less
accessibility, but he also provides a surprise for his daughter. It
is a deeply intelligent performance.
	   To Renee Zellweger fell the burden of witnessing the events and
evolving from resentment to love and appreciation. Best known for
her role opposite Tom Cruise in ``Jerry Maguire,'' she instills
extraordinary depth in her role as Ellen.
	   The Universal Pictures release was produced by Harry Ufland and
Jesse Beaton.
	   Running time is 125 minutes.

Orsay show: Van Gogh copied, then surpassed Millet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY301 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Vincent Van Gogh spent the last year of his
troubled life in an insane asylum in sunny Provence, battling
despondency and epilepsy by copying the tranquil peasant scenes of
Jean-Francois Millet.
	   Virtually identical in theme and composition, the ``copies''
born of Van Gogh's encroaching madness are on display at the Orsay
Museum side-by-side with the works that inspired them.
	   The show, which opened Sept. 13 and runs through Jan. 3,
features 85 paintings, drawings and engravings by both artists _
men separated by a generation who shared the same spiritual calling
and lifelong obsession with the noble poor.
	   Among the show's highlights are Van Gogh's ``La Sieste'' (The
Nap) and Millet's ``La Meridienne'' (Midday sun) which depict a
peasant couple napping in the shade of a haystack.
	   Millet's soft browns and green tones have been put into the Van
Gogh vernacular: the paint has been thickened, the brushstroke
widened and the whole scene illuminated by the bright Provencal sun
he knew so well.
	   ``The show is all about influence and comparison,'' said Louis
van Tilborgh, a curator at Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum, which
co-sponsored the exhibition.
	   ``Van Gogh really wanted to do something with his art, and he
found it in Millet. It's a `shock of recognition.' It's something
he felt over the years.''
	   Van Gogh discovered Millet's work at an auction shortly after
arriving in Paris in 1875, still struggling to find his vocation.
	   He was 22 but had already failed both as an art dealer and a
clergyman among Dutch miners.
	   In Millet's ``Sower,'' the celebrated portrayal of a gaunt
peasant sowing seeds, Van Gogh saw the symbol of man's union with
the earth, and he copied it in more than 13 oil paintings and 30
drawings.
	   Among the most striking paintings are small-format peasant
figures Van Gogh painted during the last months of his life to
quiet his nerves, boost his confidence and keep epileptic fits at
bay.
	   ```I started (copying) by accident, but find that it teaches me,
and above all, it comforts me,'' he wrote.
	   One poignant painting, ``First Steps,'' shows a peasant
kneeling, his arms outstretched to a baby about to take its first
steps. Van Gogh sent the painting as a gift to Theo whose wife was
about to give birth to their first child.
	   Other works depict peasants chopping wood, shearing sheep,
harvesting crops and baling hay.
	   Theo was convinced they were an unmistakable sign of his
brother's physical and emotional recovery.
	   ``Copies like those aren't really copies,'' Theo wrote. ``They
lead me to believe ... some big surprises are in store.''
	   But in May 1890, Van Gogh fled Saint-Remy for Auvers-sur-Oise,
and committed suicide two months later.

A splashy French musical starring Catherine Deneuve
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo NY342 &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHLEEN SAMPEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Catherine Deneuve is promoting a movie she says
you won't want to see. Why? Because ``The Young Girls of
Rochefort'' is a musical. Made 31 years ago. In French. With
English subtitles.
	   ``Musicals are from a different period of time,'' she explains
over coffee at a Manhattan restaurant. ``People say they are
interested in musicals, that they would like it. But I don't think
they will go see it.''
	   What's more, her singing was dubbed, and Ms. Deneuve volunteers
that lip-synching all the musical numbers as impeccably as she does
was very painstaking.
	   ``It was like an opera. Nobody was used to working like that.
Everyone thinks it was crazy to do a musical,'' she says, referring
to the mood of the late 1960s, when both the United States and
France were in social turmoil.
	   The film is the late director Jacques Demy's testimonial to the
splashy Hollywood musicals of yesteryear, so much so that he
managed to land Gene Kelly in a supporting role. The film opened in
New York and Los Angeles on Aug. 14 and elsewhere in late
September.
	   Ms. Deneuve says Demy was very single-minded about the film.
``We shot in the streets with normal people, normal houses.
(Musicals) are so not our culture.''
	   Another interesting aspect of the film is that it also stars Ms.
Deneuve's sister, Francoise Dorleac, who was 27 when she was killed
in a car crash shortly after the film's completion.
	   ``She used to say that the two of us together would make one
complete woman,'' Ms. Deneuve remembers of her sister, older by two
years. ``Because we were so different. She was energetic, and I was
more reserved.
	   ``There is a film where I can see her because it is a real
comedy, 'The Man From Rio.' I like to see pieces because I like to
hear her voice. The voice gives so much presence to a face. But I
don't like so much to see the films. It's quite emotional, quite
melancholic. I did a special on her last year for (French)
television. So I had to look at a lot of material on her. And
actually I was able to do more than what I thought I could.''
	   At 55, Ms. Deneuve is striking even without much makeup. Dressed
in a black tank dress, a silver cross dangling from her necklace,
her blond hair is swept back on top and then falls casually to her
shoulders.
	   Drinking muddy coffee and puffing on a white cigarette as long
and thin as a cocktail straw, she radiates an earthy elegance and
gives the impression of not really caring much about her looks or
anyone else's. It seems fitting that ``The Girl From Ipanema'' is
playing on the restaurant's sound system.
	   While friendly, she is not necessarily quick to smile, though
mention of France's recent World Cup victory perks her up.
	   ``I was in the stadium,'' Ms. Deneuve says of the soccer final,
her eyes shining. ``When they won I was happy, not for patriotism
but just because it was a nice feeling in the country.''
	   In ``Rochefort,'' she also doesn't display the exuberance
associated with big-screen musical performances. Instead, as
Delphine, a small-town girl searching for true love, Ms. Deneuve
exudes the same aloof, mysterious aura critics have long assigned
to her screen performances, most notably ``Repulsion,'' ``Belle de
Jour,'' ``The Hunger'' and ``Indochine,'' for which she received an
Academy Award nomination for best actress.
	   ``The Young Girls of Rochefort'' was shot on location in the
summer of 1966 in the seaside town of Rochefort, France. It was
restored in 1992 by Demy's widow, Agnes Varda, and is a companion
piece to his musical, ``The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,'' also starring
Ms. Deneuve.
	   The songs in ``Rochefort'' are so lighthearted that the couplets
are discernible even to those who don't speak French. That aspect,
combined with sunbaked outdoor scenes and wardrobes etched in pink
and blue pastels, makes the movie a timeless celluloid swirl of
cotton candy.
	   Besides Kelly, American audiences will recognize Etienne, played
by George Chakiris, who won an Oscar for his performance in ``West
Side Story.''
	   Ms. Deneuve says she isn't sure why she was awarded the Golden
Bear award at the Berlin Film Festival earlier this year for her
life's work.
	   ``There is always something solemn, ceremonial about such
things,'' she reasons, suggesting that such an honor may have come
too soon. ``It's like you are done with it, you know?''
	   When asked how she might like to be remembered, Ms. Deneuve
turns away from a photographer who is taking her portrait. Still
seated, she throws her arms open and with a warm, engagingly
mischievous smile, practically shouts, ``Like an aloof icon!''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jackie Chan gestures like he's working on the
speed bag. He bounces out of his chair to make a point and
rearranges the furniture to demonstrate how he choreographs his
stunts.
	   For Chan, this is sitting still for an interview.
	   His assistants back in Hong Kong say the action-film star
doesn't really relax anyway. But while talking about his new movie
the other day, he confesses another reason why he's treating the
chair like a throne of nails.
	   He's extremely nervous.
	   Years after miserably failing to gain big-time recognition in
the United States, Chan again is trying to win the hearts and
wallets of American moviegoers _ and he admits to feeling a lot of
pressure.
	   For one thing, he doesn't have another 15 years to play with.
And time is even more pressing in his case, because his main
drawing card, beside charm and energy, is that he does his own
stunt work, often at great risk.
	   ``Before, I'm young,'' the 44-year-old actor says in his
sometimes halting English. ``Now, if it doesn't work, that means
American audience do not accept my kind of action, or my kind of
personality, or me.''
	   His recent films have met with some modest success (``Rumble in
the Bronx'' grossed about dlrs 32 million in its North American
run) but he's hoping for dlrs 60 million, dlrs 80 million, even
dlrs 100 million for ``Rush Hour,'' co-starring Chris Tucker.
	   ``Don't forget: It's not for the money. It's for the face,'' he
says, explaining that it's a cultural thing not to want to lose
face.
	   ``You know Chinese, always face.''
	   This time around, he says, he's most willing to listen and
learn.
	   Among the lessons being proffered: shorter fight scenes.
	   ``Usually in Asia when I'm fighting, you can see fighting,
fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting _ long, long fight,'' says
Chan, who's brawnier in person than on the screen.
	   Since so much of his reputation _ and success _ is built on his
martial arts and fight scenes, he's wracked with doubt and only
hopes that he's getting good advice. ``I just don't know,'' he
says.
	   Beyond that, though, he sounds like his attitude is: anything
goes.
	   ``You want me cut my hair? Cut. You want me change my character?
Change. You want me more serious? Yes. I listen everything they
tell me to do. ...
	   ``It's not like 15 years ago. ... Boom! America destroy my
heart. Destroy my confidence. At that time I'm the biggest in Asia.
Wherever I go 20 people are with me. I think I'm the king. I don't
know how big is the world. ...
	   ``When I come to America _ boom! First, I don't know English.
And second, nobody knows me. When I walk on the street, nobody care
about me.''
	   At the time his biggest claims to movie fame in America were
small roles in ``The Cannonball Run,'' its sequel and two
forgettable movies, ``The Protector'' and ``The Big Brawl.''
	   Chan's latest swing at U.S. stardom has had a slow build since
``Rumble in the Bronx.''
	   ``Mr. Nice Guy'' cracked the box-office top 10 earlier this
year. Some of his old movies, such as ``Police Story,'' have been
reissued on video, feeding the cult following that he has here. And
Ballantine Books this month is publishing his autobiography, ``I Am
Jackie Chan.''
	   Born Chan Kong-Sang, which means ``Born in Hong Kong'' Chan, he
writes in his book that his native city in the 1950s ``was a hard
and restless place, and my family's position there was at the very
bottom of the social ladder, among the thousands of destitute
migrants who'd fled to the British colony after the mainland's
Communist Revolution.''
	   His father worked as a cook and handyman for the French consul
in Hong Kong, while his mother served as a housekeeper.
	   Because he was 12 pounds (5.4 kilos) at birth, his mother had a
Caesarian section, which cost dlrs 26. His parents didn't have
enough money to even come close to covering the cost. The female
doctor, who was childless, offered his father substantially more to
``adopt'' Chan, but his father's friends lent him the money to pay
for the surgery.
	   When he was 7, his parents moved to Australia, leaving him with
the China Drama Academy, where over the next 10 years of 19-hour
days, he learned acting, singing, dance, mime, acrobatics and a
variety of martial arts.
	   After stints as a child actor and stuntman, Chan finally broke
out of obscurity in 1978 with ``Snake in the Eagle's Shadow'' and
``Drunken Master,'' creating the genre of kung fu comedy.
	   Since then, his trademarks have been breathtaking fights using
any prop at hand, slapstick comedy, a nice guy persona and
death-defying stunts, which he's always performed himself.
	   Doing his own stunts has maybe been the single biggest
ingredient of his international popularity. Those stunts have
resulted in broken or dislocated bones from his ankle to his head _
which, quite literally, has a hole in it.
	   He assures a visitor that there's ``a plastic plug there to keep
my brains in.''
	   Over the years, Chan has been compared to Harold Lloyd and
Buster Keaton, whom he sees as a role model. And just as kids today
see a silent film by Buster Keaton and say, ``Wow,'' Chan would
like a new generation look at his work 50 years from now and also
say, ``Wow.''
	   If he can achieve a big commercial breakthrough with ``Rush
Hour,'' he says he'd like to work with the biggest American
directors, and he'd like to direct action films.
	   He worries about slowing down physically but he doesn't think
that's happened yet. And remember, he says, it's just the movies.
	   ``I'm not going to the stage to fight with Mike Tyson. I'm on
the movie set,'' Chan says. ``When I'm feeling not so good, maybe
I'm tired _ wrap. Go home. Tomorrow, come again. Good sleep.
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bap,'' he says, throwing quick, short punches in the
air.

A journey from cabaret to motherhood to `Chicago'

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It is a long way from a tiny, dark Berlin
nightspot where a young woman sang Kurt Weill, to the sunny,
cheerfully disorganized front parlor of a West Side brownstone that
resembles Romper Room in chaos.
	   Children's playthings are scattered everywhere. A lunch box. A
few dolls. Stuffed animals. Board games. And most intriguingly, a
large plastic banana. A small boy, dressed in a Superman outfit,
buzzes about.
	   Ute Lemper, international chanteuse and now star of the Broadway
musical ``Chicago,'' is moving in _ with husband, actor-writer
David Tabatsky, and their two children, 4-year-old Max, and
daughter Stella, 2. And things aren't quite settled.
	   Several grim, almost expressionistic paintings _ all done by
Lemper _ lean against the wall on the floor. A dark, brooding
portrait of jazz great Miles Davis. A group of women, all arms and
legs, who are not having a good day.
	   The toys and paintings are reminders of two distinct parts of
Lemper's life. ``Chicago'' represents a third _ Lemper's foray into
the world of Kander and Ebb, first starring last year in the London
production and now replacing Bebe Neuwirth in New York.
	   Neuwirth is more than a hard act to follow. Her icy precision as
hard-boiled femme fatale Velma Kelly already is the stuff of
Broadway legend. Yet Lemper has put her own stamp on the role. The
voice may be more Teutonic than tough guy, but the leggy performer
delivers an exotic, even eccentric performance that is fresh and
funny and totally her own.
	   ``I realized in the rehearsal process that Velma Kelly doesn't
have a dramatic edge to her,'' Lemper says. ``Her story is not
incredibly developed. There's not a sad, introverted edge to her.
When she's up there on stage, she's really up there.
	   ``It took me quite a while to understand that. Usually I work
much more from the interior: You sit on the stage, you take all the
time that you want, and then you develop the stories you want to
tell.''
	   The barefoot Lemper sits serenely on a sofa in the middle of all
the clutter. The 35-year-old performer looks younger, more
vulnerable than the alluring woman with stylish blond hair _ a
cross between Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo _ who has begun to
appear on billboards and sides of buses advertising ``Chicago.''
	   That allure has been noticeable since her performing days in
Berlin in the early 1980s when she was developing a cabaret act
that would win her acclaim across Europe.
	   ``Berlin in the early 1980s was a very isolated place,'' says
Lemper, who was born in Munster in Westphalia. ``The Wall was up,
but the city was vibrant with history. It was also a very political
city, straightforward, very aggressive and oddly claustrophobic
because you couldn't get out. So there really were a lot of
creative things going on.''
	   Berlin was a city ripe for Lemper's exploration of 1920s cabaret
material, particularly the music of Weill. She had first learned of
the composer of ``The Threepenny Opera'' and ``Seven Deadly Sins''
when she was a teen-ager, attending summer seminars in Salzburg.
	   ``I listened to his music more and more, getting all the records
of people like Lotte Lenya,'' she says. ``Then I had an awakening
in my early 20s about the Holocaust and other Jewish composers and
their input into the German music tradition at that time.
	   ``It was then that I started to conceive my first Kurt Weill
evening. I went through Weill's life, from the beginnings right
after the First World War, then later into the 1920s and the other
people he worked with like Brecht and finally his emigration to
France and the United States.''
	   Those early evenings of Weill were done in tiny cellar clubs,
no-frills cabaret with Lemper wearing leather pants, a T-shirt and
no makeup. ``It was completely straightforward with no
microphones,'' she says. ``Mostly the evening was for people of my
generation who never really heard about it.
	   ``The history of all these artists being thrown out of the
country or killed, during the time I grew up in the 1960s and the
1970s, was hardly talked about it. The war had been over for only
30 years. It was looked at historically but you didn't speak about
the impact _ what Hitler did was completely ignored. Maybe people
couldn't face it.
	   ``And with my parents, they were kids during the war. Their
memories of the war were of bombs falling down and running into the
cellar. My mother had nightmares for years after that.''
	   Lemper finds ``Chicago'' an amazing change of pace from the
isolated performance world of cabaret. She had first seen the
musical when the revival opened in New York, and knew she had to be
in it. She auditioned for the role of Roxie Hart but was offered
Velma when the London company was formed.
	   ``I was looking forward to working in a company, to share the
stage, to have partners and to sing together with them,'' she says.
``It was a relief after all those dark, torturous songs I usually
sing.''
	   It also was a relief not to have to tour the world and live out
of a suitcase. Besides, she says, children need to be settled.
	   ``I did a lot of traveling when they were little. I took them
everywhere. But that has to be adjusted. Still, I am not working
less. I am just picking the work a little bit differently. My
children put everything into perspective.''

	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Elvis Presley finally gets his due
at this year's Country Music Association Awards.
	   Presley, who died in 1977, joins singers Tammy Wynette and
George Morgan _ country singer Lorrie Morgan's father _ and music
executive E.W. ``Bud'' Wendell as inductees into the Country Music
Hall of Fame.
	   The three-hour CMA awards show and Hall of Fame induction at the
Grand Ole Opry House will be broadcast at 8 p.m. EDT Wednesday
(Sept. 23) (0000 GMT Thursday Sept. 24) on CBS. Vince Gill is the
host for the seventh straight year.
	   ``There will be a substantial nod to Elvis and his music and
contributions to country music,'' said Ed Benson, CMA executive
director. ``Some people may be up in arms about Elvis Presley going
into the Hall of Fame, so we want to show why he deserves to be in
there.
	   ``Just about any country music star you ask was influenced by
his music and showmanship.''
	   Early in his career, Presley played on country music radio
showcases like the Louisiana Hayride and Grand Ole Opry. The B-side
of his first single, ``That's All Right,'' was a revved-up version
of bluegrass master Bill Monroe's ``Blue Moon of Kentucky.'' The
song never made it to No. 1 on the country charts, but 11 other
Presley records did.
	   Travis Tritt, Trisha Yearwood and Dwight Yoakam are among the
many contemporary country stars who count Presley as a major
influence.
	   In addition to the induction, highlights of this year's CMA show
include Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood singing ``Where the Road
Leads,'' and performances by Reba McEntire, Faith Hill, Patty
Loveless, Tim McGraw, Steve Wariner, Lee Ann Womack and others.
	   There also will be musical salutes to Morgan and Wynette, who
died in April.
	   George Strait is the leading nominee with five, and his 47
career nominations are the most of any performer in CMA history.
Gill has won the most (17), including Entertainer of the Year in
1993 and 1994.
	   This year's nominees for best entertainer are Garth Brooks (last
year's winner), Gill, Strait, Tim McGraw and the duo of Kix Brooks
and Ronnie Dunn. It is McGraw's first nomination in the category.
	   ``It takes a little while to get this kind of recognition,''
McGraw said. ``I'm just glad that I've stayed around long enough to
have a chance at it.''
	   Brooks, Gill, McGraw, Strait and Collin Ray are vying for best
male vocalist. Best female vocalist nominees are McGraw's wife,
Faith Hill, Patty Loveless, Martina McBride, Lee Ann Womack and
Yearwood.
	   ``Obviously, I feel insecure being in that category with the
girls that have been doing this awhile,'' Womack said of her first
nomination in the category. ``I'll feel a little bit out of place,
but still thrilled to be there.''
	   Besides best entertainer and male vocalist, Strait is up for
best single for ``I Just Want To Dance With You,'' album for ``One
Step at a Time,'' and music video for ``Carrying Your Love with
Me.''
	   ``I Just Want To Dance With You'' also is up for best song, but
the award will go to songwriters John Prine and Roger Cook if it
wins.
	   Alan Jackson and LeAnn Rimes failed to score any nominations
this year. Jackson had been nominated for at least one award every
year since 1990.
	   ``The awards shows have been pretty good to me,'' said Jackson,
who was named Entertainer of the Year in 1995. ``I've always won my
share for a long time. You can't continue to be nominated and win
forever.''
	   Jackson still will perform on the show, singing his hit, ``I'll
Go on Loving You.''
	   The CMA winners are selected by 6,100 country music industry
workers, while the Country Music Hall of Fame inductees are chosen
by about 300 people selected by the CMA executive committee.
	   Last year's CMA awards show was the highest program of the
evening in all adult demographics.

Rock hall pays tribute to early blues master Robert Johnson

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ If it's true the blues had a baby and named it
rock 'n' roll, then many would agree Robert Johnson was the daddy.
	   A blues guitarist and singer of almost mythic status among
musicians, Johnson's impact can be heard any day on FM radio
through the people who were touched by his work.
	   Yet he never achieved widespread fame, either in his short life
or in the 60 years since his mysterious death.
	   Starting Sunday (Sept. 20), however, the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame and Museum is celebrating Johnson's musical legacy with eight
days of talks, concerts and jam sessions paying tribute to the
early master who recorded just 29 songs.
	   ``Johnson is one of those guys who transcends the whole blues
genre,'' says Joe Louis Walker, one of a list of musical guests
expected in Cleveland. ``He was very accessible. Everybody from
Muddy Waters to Aerosmith _ and everybody in between _ would have
something to say about Robert Johnson.''
	   Robert Santelli, education director at rock's Hall of Fame, is
even more succinct: ``If you're going to look at the impact of the
blues on rock 'n' roll, you have to start with Robert Johnson.''
	   Born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi, in 1911, Johnson was a man who
lived the rock 'n' roll life years before the term ``rock 'n'
roll'' was even coined.
	   He married young and tried his hand at sharecropping to support
himself. But his 16-year-old wife, Virginia, and their first child
both died when the baby was born in 1930. Shortly thereafter,
Johnson's guitar became his livelihood.
	   He traveled restlessly, almost ceaselessly, playing on the
streets and in the juke joints of the Mississippi Delta. All of his
songs were recorded in five sessions in November 1936 and June
1937.
	   It was a hard life.
	   ``Robert was kind of quiet but he was a good blues player. He
liked to drink. He liked his women,'' recalled guitarist David
``Honeyboy'' Edwards, who played with Johnson.
	   In fact, it may have been his taste for alcohol and a woman that
cost Johnson his life.
	   On the night of Aug. 13, 1938, Johnson played a country
roadhouse outside Greenwood, Mississippi. What happened next is
still the subject of speculation but according to witnesses,
including Edwards, the bar owner _ jealous that his wife had taken
up with Johnson _ poisoned the musician's whisky.
	   Edwards said Johnson sat in a corner for a while with his guitar
in his arms. The crowd asked for blues but Johnson couldn't
perform.
	   ``Robert said, `Well sir, I don't feel good,''' Edwards said. He
was taken to a friend's home and died a few days later at age 27.
	   Biographer Peter Guralnick said what makes Johnson special is
that he took the Delta blues he learned from people like Son House,
mixed it with popular music and other influences, and came up with
something new and intensely emotional that has captured listeners
ever since.
	   ``He had his own style of playing and at that time it was
different from the other blues musicians in the Delta,'' Edwards
recalled. ``He added more to his blues style than any of them
had.''
	   The Rolling Stones' Keith Richards has said Johnson was so deft
that when he first heard the blues man play solo, he thought two
people were playing guitar.
	   But Johnson was more than a guitar player. He had a gift for
writing simple yet compelling lyrics. Consider the final verse of
``Love in Vain,'' a tune later covered by the Stones. Here's how
Johnson captures the isolation of a man parting from his lover:
	   ``When the train, it left the station, with two lights on behind
	   ``When the train, it left the station, with two lights on behind
	   ``Well, the blue light was my blues, and the red light was my
mind.
	   ``All my love's in vain.''
	   ``His poetry is extraordinary,'' said Larry Cohn, who won a
Grammy in 1991 for producing a CD box set of all Johnson's
recordings plus alternate takes of some songs. ``It's as haunting
and current as it was when it was written and will be 100 years
from now.''
	   Cohn's release of Johnson's work revived interest in the
musician, just as a 1961 release of some of his recordings under
the title ``King of the Delta Blues Singers'' influenced a host of
musicians of that era: Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page.
	   Coincidentally, ``King of the Delta Blues Singers'' was reissued
Sept. 15 with a bonus, alternate take of ``Traveling Riverside
Blues'' included.
	   Santelli said the events at the rock hall should show how
Johnson's work has spread throughout popular music.
	   The lineup for a ``juke joint jam'' at a Cleveland nightclub on
Saturday night features Walker, George Thorogood and Johnny Winter.
A concert the following night includes the Grateful Dead's Bob
Weir, jazz singer Cassandra Wilson and the Allman Brothers Band.
Each artist is being asked to perform a Johnson song.
	   ``All their styles are different,'' Santelli said. ``Yet a case
can be made that Johnson's music links them. And we'll make that
case.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Everyone has childhood memories. Here's one of
Christopher Dickey's: waking each morning at 6 to the clinking of
ice cubes in the kitchen _ Mom's first Scotch of the day.
	   Dickey's mother was drinking herself to death. But the real
perpetrator, as recounted in her son's excruciating and moving
memoir, was her husband, James: renowned poet, novelist and author
of ``Deliverance.''
	   James Dickey was a genius, we learn. He also lied and cheated.
He made up stories so often you never knew when he was telling the
truth. His rampant infidelity made his wife's existence a living
hell.
	   There was more: As commercial success came, he cut himself off
from his family, withdrawing into an egotistical, liquor-induced
haze. He watched alcohol kill his wife, and eventually he allowed
it to kill him as well.
	   But not before a two-year period when he was weak but sober.
That is when Christopher Dickey, an author and Newsweek's bureau
chief in Paris, was finally able to speak, honestly and at length,
to his father.
	   The result of those talks, ``Summer of Deliverance'' (Simon and
Schuster) isn't a book about hate or revenge, as some reviews might
have you believe (``Dud as a Dad,'' read one headline.)
	   It is, rather, a story about a difficult love _ complicated,
painful, but redemptive; a story about a son's efforts, even as he
was writing the book, to reach across the bridge that divides many
of us from our parents.
	   And a story about gratitude, too. Because after all the sordid
details, the reader is left with something resembling a happy
ending. Chris Dickey, who became a foreign correspondent to get as
far away from James as he could, was able to do something many
can't: He got to know his father again, before it was too late.
	   ``I wanted the book to have a happy ending,'' Dickey says,
``because I wanted my father's life to have a happy ending.''
	   The memoir does not begin gently.
	   ``My father was a great poet, a famous novelist, a powerful
intellect,'' and a man he hated, Chris Dickey writes on the first
page.
	   And it's easy to see why the son so detested the father.
	   ``I believed _ I KNEW _ that he had killed my mother,'' Dickey
writes. ``He belittled and betrayed her, humiliated her and forgot
about her, then watched her over the course of a few years quietly,
relentlessly poison herself with the whisky she had at her right
hand all day long every day until she died, bloated, her liver
hardening and the veins in her esophagus erupting, bleeding to
death at the age of 50.''
	   It wasn't always that bad. Dickey tells of the days before the
fame, before the drinking got really bad, when life ``was an
adventure story, not a horror show.''
	   The family moved around the country and around Europe. James
Dickey gained popularity as a poet. But nobody was prepared for
what would happen once ``Deliverance'' was published in 1970.
	   The following summer, the novel about four suburbanites who go
canoeing in the Appalachian wilderness and enter a world of redneck
horror was made into a film, starring Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds.
	   ``And after that, nothing good was the same,'' Dickey writes.
	   The book gives a detailed account of the filming, one any
``Deliverance'' fan will relish: the off-set escapades of Reynolds,
the troubled relationship between Dickey and director John Boorman,
the lines that didn't make it into the film. A harrowing section
describes the shooting of the famous scene in which Ned Beatty's
character, Bobby, is sodomized.
	   But life off-screen was harrowing, too. It was bad enough for
Christopher and his brother, Kevin, but worse for their mother,
Maxine, who bore the brunt of James Dickey's abusiveness, all the
more cruel for its unpredictability.
	   Take, for example, a poetry reading at Rice University, where
James Dickey stood before an audience that included his wife and
sons and read a new poem called ``Adultery.''
	   As the poet described being in rooms ``where someone is always
checking the wrist watch to see how much longer we have left,'' his
son sat there, ``hoping I could find a way to say he was making
this up.''
	   But he couldn't. ``My lover, my dear one, I will see you next
week,'' the poet read. Chris, unable to look at his mother,
thought: ``Ah, Jesus, Dad. Oh, come on.''
	   And then the poem ended: ``Guilt is magical.'' A thin smattering
of uneasy applause.
	   James Dickey cheated on his children, too, with lies. He told
the young Chris he'd been married before, to a woman who then died
of blood poisoning. Years later, he said he'd made it up.
	   Why? ``Just to do it,'' his father said.
	   ``Summer of Deliverance'' began to take shape in the summer of
1994, when the author finally went back home to South Carolina, and
James Dickey was seriously ill but sober. Over the next two years,
Chris took on the endless task of cleaning out his father's garage,
and basically ``rearranging his life.'' He arranged to have his
father's university classes taped. He also taped their own talks.
	   James Dickey died on Jan. 19, 1997. At first, Chris felt he
couldn't go on with the book. Then he threw himself into it,
finishing it in a hotel room in Tehran during a reporting trip.
	   Would his father have objected to the brutal honesty in its
pages, like the description of his abusive second marriage to a
now-reformed drug addict? Maybe. But Dickey thinks his father would
have approved.
	   ``I wanted to bring him back to life,'' the author says. ``I
couldn't have done that if I had written about a saint.''
	   His father, he says, spent much time in their final
conversations trying to set the record straight on all sorts of
things. But he really only had one urgent request.
	   ``Remember,'' he told Chris, ``what I was to you. Not to anyone
else. To you.''

Five questions with Martin Gore: on tour with Depeche Mode
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIME HOLGUIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ To pen his melancholy lyrics, Martin Gore often
returns to the topic that's closest to him.
	   ``Songs about relationships are always quite high on my priority
list,'' said Gore, co-founder and songwriter for Depeche Mode.
``It's something that's happening around me all the time.'' Depeche
Mode was formed in 1980 and is known for such hits as ``Just Can't
Get Enough'' and ``Personal Jesus.''
	   On the British band's new single, ``Only When I Lose Myself,''
Gore again explores topics like co-dependence and obsessive love.
The song is featured on a new retrospective record, ``The Singles
1986-98,'' scheduled for release Oct. 6.
	   Gore, singer Dave Gahan and keyboardist Andy Fletcher were in
Manhattan in July to film a video, which Gore described as very
``ethereal,'' with many images of wrecked cars. ``Our bit was very
simple, basically rocking backwards and forwards out of lights,''
Gore said. ``I suppose it'll all be done in post-production.''
	   The band recently launched the European leg of a world tour, its
first in five years, in Helsinki, Finland. U.S. tour dates include
Madison Square Garden in New York on Oct. 28, with shows also
scheduled in Miami, Houston, Denver and San Diego until the end of
the year.
	   Veteran band photographer and visual collaborator Anton Corbijn
designed the low-key, 1930s-inspired stage for the tour. Corbijn
has been documenting Depeche Mode for the past 12 years, as the
band steadily gained worldwide fame. But the future of Depeche Mode
became uncertain when Gahan almost died after a drug overdose in a
West Hollywood hotel room in 1996.
	   ``There was a period that lasted for a week where I very
seriously considered if this was a viable option anymore,'' Gore
recalled.
	   Prior to launching its new world tour, the band stayed away from
the rigors of the road. Gore is confident that the respite has made
Depeche Mode more mentally fit. ``We have to see it more as a work
scenario and not as 'just go out and party every night,''' he said.
``Before, I think the music was very secondary. If you could
remember a show, it was a rare night.''
	   1. How easy is it to give in to temptations when you're on the
road for a long stretch of time?
	   Gore: Every time you play in a city, there's always something
that someone has arranged for you. And it's sometimes very hard to
turn those things down. Every night tended to turn into a party. We
want to try to avoid that this time.
	   2. How sure of your success were you when you formed the band in
1980?
	   Gore: I'm not sure we knew that it was going to happen. But we
did know that what we were doing was right, and that it was wrong
to carry on in some rock rut that had been happening for God knows
how many years.
	   3. Your use of keyboard-driven beats was considered
groundbreaking. Now it's the norm. How do you feel about the recent
rise in popularity of techno and other electronic-driven music?
	   Gore: The whole thing seems obvious to us. I don't feel
vindicated or anything. Everything takes time, even down to videos.
When we made the Barrel of a Gun video, we were told nobody liked
it. .... It just wasn't right for TV. Now we're about to make this
new video and we're being told, 'Oh, can't we have something like
Barrel of a Gun?' The whole thing just makes you laugh.
	   4. The new collection documents an era for Depeche Mode during
which it transformed itself from a strictly electronic pop band to
a band more willing to embrace its blues, country and gospel roots.
What was the impetus for the change in direction?
	   Gore: We set ridiculous rules when we started out because I was
actually a guitar player. ... And I felt slightly frustrated by the
fact that I couldn't play guitar in this band. We started off as
electronic purists who really wanted to be totally different from
everybody else. It was a nice philosophy but we took it to its
extremes.
	   5. Can you describe your songwriting process?
	   Gore: I sit down and start playing around with melodies and
somehow words just come out; they're suggested to me. The words and
the melody come at the same time. I never sit down and write the
words to a whole song and then put music to it. I think maybe
that's why it's so natural. If you sit down and write a poem and
put it to music, I think you're really having to think too much.

Designer Helmut Lang invents Faux Fashion Week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo NY346 &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: `7th on Sixth' is cq &QL; 
 &UR; By CAROL DEEGAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It started with designer Helmut Lang.
	   Lang, who has moved his business from Vienna to New York,
announced this summer that he would break with tradition and show
his spring 1999 collection in September, ahead of the European
collections.
	   It was the birth of what some have called Faux Fashion Week, the
week of Sept. 14-18, when a dozen designers showed their spring
collections ahead of 7th on Sixth's official Fashion Week. Four
dozen designers _ names like Bill Blass, Ralph Lauren, Isaac
Mizrahi and Oscar de la Renta _ will show in November, as
originally scheduled.
	   Nicole Miller invited 300 press and retailers to her 7th Avenue
showroom Monday. Donna Karan showed both her DKNY and Donna Karan
collections midweek. Lang's show followed Thursday, with Calvin
Klein and Vivienne Tam's shows on Friday.
	   ``We're thrilled to be the first in the world to show,'' said
Nicole Miller CEO Bud Konheim. ``We're getting a six-week or
seven-week jump on everyone else. Nicole gets to show her stuff
first.''
	   The organization known as 7th on Sixth, which coordinates the
semiannual Fashion Week, is planning to shift all the American
shows from April to February, ahead of the Europeans. The shift
will mean a calendar of spring shows in September instead of
November next year.
	   Although this year's jump to September has drawn mixed reviews,
Santo Versace, who runs the business side of Versace and is the
recently elected president of the Italian Fashion Chamber, said the
move was a shrewd one.
	   ``It's the most intelligent move ever made. It puts them over a
month ahead with the buyers and production,'' Versace said.
	   He said there were no plans at present to react but that in the
future, ``Europe will have to face up to it.'' For planning
purposes, Versace said it didn't really affect the October round of
shows in Italy.
	   Tam said the earlier showing would give her a longer production
time and would help her expand into the international market.
	   Earlier deliveries mean a longer sales season, Miller said.
	   ``A lot of people have department store business. They spend too
much of their budget in Europe and not enough is left for U.S.
companies,'' she said. ``It's always good to get in there ahead.''

	   In the spotlight: Bruce Springsteen, blue-collar boss
	    &UR; Personal stats: Bruce Springsteen was born into a working-class
family in Freehold, New Jersey, on Sept. 23, 1949. He fell in love
with rock 'n' roll at an early age. ``When I was 9, I couldn't
imagine anyone not wanting to be Elvis Presley,'' he says.
	   Despite his father's doubts about a musical career, Springsteen
never wavered from his dreams of performing. Arguments with his
father would later inspire some of his most heartfelt songs _ from
the anguished fury of ``Adam Raised a Cain'' to the wistful
farewell of ``Independence Day'' and the poignant reconciliation of
``Walk Like a Man.''
	   Springsteen joined the Castiles in 1965 and began playing dates
in Asbury Park, New Jersey, quickly becoming known as the Jimi
Hendrix of the Jersey shore.
	    &UR; Born to play: Springsteen gained critical acclaim _ but little
airplay _ with his debut album, ``Greetings From Asbury Park, New
Jersey,'' and his sophomore set, ``The Wild, the Innocent, and the
E Street Shuffle.''
	   ``Born to Run,'' released in 1975, was immediately acclaimed.
Springsteen was featured on the covers of both Time and Newsweek
magazines.
	   After several years of legal disputes over his record contract,
``Darkness on the Edge of Town'' was released in 1978. It was
almost immediately certified platinum. On the tour that followed,
Bruce Springstreen
	   and the E Street Band developed into one of the most powerful
ensembles in rock, and Springsteen was routinely hailed for his
three-hour performances.
	   ``Born in the U.S.A.,'' released in 1984, became a multiplatinum
album, establishing Springsteen as one of the most dominant forces
in '80s rock music. In late 1986, having performed more than 500
shows in the past decade, Springsteen released the five-album set,
``Live 1975-1985.'' The album entered the U.S. chart at No. 1.
After that, a shift toward the tensions and joys of relationships
was reflected in the albums, ``Tunnel of Love,'' ``Human Touch''
and ``Lucky Town.''
	   In 1995, Springsteen's ``Streets of Philadelphia'' won song of
the year, best male rock performance and best rock song written
specifically for motion picture or television at the Grammy Awards.
The song was written and performed by Springsteen for the 1993
movie, ``Philadelphia.'' The song also won an Oscar.
	    &UR; Quote: ``When you're young and you pick up a guitar, it feels
so powerful. It feels like you pulled the sword from the stone. I
used to believe that it could save the world. But I don't really
believe that any more.''

At the Movies: 'A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: movie opened Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By LINDA DEUTSCH &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A new film from the respected Merchant-Ivory
production team usually is cause for excitement. Like a present
wrapped in an exclusive Tiffany box, we unwrap it with great
expectations. When the contents don't measure up, the
disappointment is doubled.
	   ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' is not a bad film. It's
just not up to this team's abilities. Even with the talents of
screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, director James Ivory and stars
Kris Kristofferson and Barbara Hershey, the movie never gets beyond
being mildly interesting.
	   Don't expect ``Howards End'' or ``A Room With a View.''
	   It should be noted that the glue holding this film together is a
remarkable performance by 15-year-old Leelee Sobieski as the
daughter who tells the story. The young actress, recently seen in
``Deep Impact,'' is on the screen constantly and when she's there,
an otherwise turgid film can be a heart tugger.
	   ``A Soldier's Daughter'' is billed as a recounting of the
relationship between the late author James Jones and his daughter.
	   Kaylie Jones wrote the autobiographical novel on which the film
is based. An American family _ mother, father and daughter _ moves
to Paris where the parents adopt a French boy from an unwed mother.
The father is a best-selling author working on his latest novel.
The story is told through the memory of the daughter, Channe, as
the two children struggle to adjust to each other, to their
bilingual school and to the unusual schoolmates they encounter.
	   It has the elements of an intriguing saga. But the film's
structure is perplexing. Unable to unify all of its characters'
stories, the filmmakers choose to break it up into episodes. For
instance, the first episode is entitled ``Billy'' for the adopted
child. Another section is ``Channe.'' The viewer's attention is
diverted by the change of focus. One subplot, involving an
artistic, mannered young boy who befriends Channe, is temporarily
involving but never fully explored.
	   Kristofferson's role should be pivotal, but in the first half of
the film he has little to do and in the second half we never get
beyond the surface of the man he is portraying. The author comes
off as a gruff man's man who adores his daughter but does give her
the silly admonition, ``a soldier's daughter never cries.''
	   Through his daughter's eyes, he is the perfect father,
understanding of everything including his daughter's teen-age
sexual adventures. Kristofferson seems uncomfortable in the role
and Hershey as his wife all but fades into the scenery.
	   A crisis finally occurs when the father, stricken with heart
problems, decides to move his family back to the United States to
be near his doctors and to bring the children back to their
American roots. The transition is difficult. The children don't fit
in at their new high school, and, of course, the father's illness
worsens. The denouement is predictable.
	   ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' is released by October
Films. Running time is 124 minutes.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A cooking gas storage center near
the airport went up in a ball of fire Saturday, injuring one worker
and forcing authorities to cancel flights temporarily.
	   Fire department spokesman Capt. Juan Granados said about 85,000
gallons (330,000 liters) of liquid propane gas exploded and burned
in the air at the Texaco Oil Co. installation.
	   The tank farm is located about 200 yards from the Toncontin
international airport control tower in a residential section of the
capital.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ A cement truck plunged 65 feet (20
meters) from an overpass and landed on traffic below, crushing cars
and killing 11 people, firefighters said Saturday.
	   The crash occurred just after noon about 30 miles (50 kms) north
of the capital, on a road linking Brasilia to the outlying town of
Sobradinho, firefighter Reginaldo Jesus Souza said by telephone.
	   The cause of the accident wasn't clear. Brazilian media reported
that the truck apparently lost its brakes.
	   Three people, including the truck's driver, were hospitalized
with serious injuries, Souza said.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Grupo Televisa SA are to introduce a new way
to sell advertising time, a major step in the Mexican media giant's
drive to boost profits.
	   Televisa plans to scrap its 16-year-old system which requires up
front payments for the coming year with an option to add time
during the year at the same rate. It will be replaced next year
with a plan where prices are linked to audience ratings.
	   Televisa officials confirmed Friday that they were briefing
advertising agencies on changes, and would do the same for major
advertisers during the next few weeks.
	   Investors and analysts have complained that the old plan has
prevented Televisa from translating improved ratings into an
improved bottom line.
	   Revenues fell during the second quarter despite impressive
ratings gains against its young archrival in Mexican television, TV
Azteca SA.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A gunman opened fire on a crowd watching a
prize fight on television in a restaurant, killing four people and
wounding six, police said Saturday.
	   A police report said the crowd had been watching Mexican
welterweight Julio Cesar Chavez fight Oscar de la Hoya in Las Vegas
on Friday night when the gunman walked in.
	   The police report quoted witnesses as saying the man pulled out
a a gun and started firing indiscriminately, according to
government news agency Notimex. He then fled.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Supply of goods and services in Mexico's
economy during the first half of 1998 grew 8.3 percent from the
same period last year, the Treasury Department reported.
	   Gross domestic product growth of 5.4 percent and a 19.9 percent
increase in imports accounted for the increase, the department said
in a press release late Friday.
	   Private consumption among households rose 8.5 percent compared
with the first half of last year. Fixed capital formation rose 16.8
percent. Exports of goods and services rose 12.9 percent.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) _ More than 1,000 people living
near Mt. Pacaya were evacuated Saturday after the volcano erupted
and spewed huge plumes of ash.
	   At Guatemala City's nearby La Aurora airport, aviation officials
announced the suspension of flights because runways were coated
with gritty ash.
	   Pacaya, 8,421 feet (2,552 meters) tall, is located 19 miles (30
kms) from downtown Guatemala City and is the country's most active
volcano.
	   The Center for Disasters Control said people in the villages of
El Patrocinio, El Caracol and El Rodeo _ those nearest the craters
_ were evacuated and taken to shelters in the town of Vicente
Pacaya.
	   ___
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ A Lebanese citizen in custody of FBI
agents flew to the United States early Saturday to face charges of
forgery in a New York court, Paraguayan police said.
	   Muhammad Garib Makki, 39, was detained Thursday at Ciudad del
Este, 390 kilometers (240 miles) east of Asuncion.
	   Garib Makki had a United States passport, a police spokesman
said. He did not indicate wether it was forged.
	   Garib Makki, who arrived at this South American nation Sept. 15,
faces charges of forging U.S. passports, visas and immigration
green cards for Lebanon-based Hezbollah, the spokesman said.
	   Ciudad del Este, near the borders with Brazil and Argentina, has
a large Muslim community.
	   ___
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ A suspect has been rearrested and will be
charged Monday with killing two women tourists whose bodies were
discovered hours apart in August, police said Saturday.
	   The 18-year-old suspect, who has not yet been identified pending
the formal filing of charges, had been initially taken into custody
by police on August 22, the day the bodies were found. Police
Commissioner B.K. Bonamy said Saturday that new evidence had led
police to arrest the suspect again, but he did not disclose what it
was.
	   The suspect will be accused of killing Lori Fogleman, a
32-year-old school teacher from Richmond, Virginia, and Joanne
Clark, 24, of Oxfordshire, England, Bonamy said.
	   The FBI and Scotland Yard sent officers to assist local police
in investigating the two killings.

	   ENTEBBE, Uganda (AP) _ Authorities are closing in on suspects
wanted for allegedly planning attacks on American targets
worldwide, with arrests in Uganda and charges planned against two
suspects in Tanzania. A suspect also was arrested in Germany.
	   In Uganda, police have arrested 18 people suspected of planning
attacks on American and other foreign diplomatic missions as well
as Ugandan government installations, a senior official said
Saturday.
	   ``They wanted to hit key installations, not only American but of
the Ugandan government. We have all the documentary material on
their operations,'' said David Pulkol, Director of Internal
Security.
	   Investigators, meanwhile, continue to pursue suspects in the
Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which
killed 258 people, including 12 Americans, and injured 5,500.
	   In Tanzania, authorities were preparing to charge two suspects
in connection with the Dar Es Salaam bombing. And a close associate
of Osama bin Laden, who is wanted by U.S. authorities in connection
with the bombings, was arrested in Germany.
	   Among those arrested in Uganda was businessman Ahamed Mandela,
financial secretary of the Express Football Club. Pulkol said most
of the arrests were made in the capital, Kampala, during the past
15 days. He would not provide further details.
	   Five diplomatic missions in the Ugandan capital of Kampala,
including the U.S. Embassy and the British High Commission, were
closed at the beginning of the week following a series of
threatening telephone calls.
	   In Tanzania, two suspects being held in connection with the
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam will be charged in a
local court next week, the daily Mtanzania newspaper reported
Saturday. They were expected to be charged with murder, conspiracy
and bombing.
	   Omar Mahita, head of the Tanzanian police, would only identify
the suspects as a Tanzanian from Zanzibar and a foreigner, the
newspaper said.
	   Two suspects were in custody in New York, charged with the
murder of the 12 Americans who died in the Nairobi bombing.
	   German police, meanwhile, have arrested a man described as a
close associate of Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, according to
the Justice Ministry in the German state of Bavaria.
	   Officials did not release the identity of the man, though the
state Interior Ministry said he had arrived from Sudan. They said
he was arrested Wednesday near Munich. The ministry said it would
confirm the man's identity this week and determine what he was
doing in Germany.
	   In a report Saturday, The Washington Post identified the suspect
as Mamduh Mahmud Salim and described him as a top lieutenant and
weapons procurer for bin Laden.
	   The Post said U.S. officials have filed charges against Salim in
New York. It also said a sealed warrant seeking Salim's arrest was
issued recently in Manhattan.

Financial crisis means Russians are putting off vacation plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ They escaped Russia's freezing winters and mild
summers in droves, heading for the blazing heat of Egypt and the
beaches of the French Riviera. They toured the sights of Europe and
explored exotic islands in the Indian Ocean.
	   But these days, Russians are staying put.
	   The travel fever that gripped the country after the fall of the
Soviet Union is on the wane, as the ruble plummets and the economy
continues to slide.
	   ``People are more worried about saving their money now,'' said
Sergei Kuznetsov, advertising manager at the Irene tour agency in
Moscow. ``They've got other things to worry about.''
	   When the Soviet Union fell, Russians could travel freely to many
spots around the world for the first time in 80 years after the
government eased regulations on leaving the country.
	   Previously, it was almost impossible for Soviet citizens to
travel abroad because of authoritarian controls. Only a favored few
were allowed to travel, usually just in supervised groups on
strictly monitored itineraries.
	   Last year alone an estimated 5 million Russians traveled abroad
to places like Cyprus, Spain, and France. The more adventurous _
and wealthy _ went to islands like the Maldives.
	   ``Before, we didn't even dream about it,'' said Eleonora
Albrecht, a speech pathologist who has traveled extensively
throughout Europe in the last five years with friends. The trips
have become ``something to live for,'' she said.
	   Others started going places tourists rarely go, vacationing
``everywhere they could,'' said Alla Dobrovolskaya, a columnist
with the Segodnya newspaper. ``Travel became a symbol of freedom.
After so many years, they could finally do it.''
	   But now, as many in Russia's emerging middle class lose their
jobs with the collapse of financial companies, ad agencies, and
banks, the travel agencies that sprouted up in Moscow during the
boom are as deserted as a beach resort in the dead of winter.
	   ``Most of our inexpensive tours have been stopped or are just
dead, dead, dead,'' said Jan Passoff, president of IRO Travel.
Though wealthy Russians continue to buy some tours, the rest have
just fled the market, he said.
	   For Albrecht, who saved up for her trips each year, ruble
inflation has left journeys to Europe ``out of the question,'' she
said.
	   ``Now, with the crisis, we will have to go to St. Petersburg, or
study Moscow in greater detail. We'll read literature about other
countries and watch the videos we filmed when we were there.''
	   The financial crisis also means a large drop in the once booming
``shuttle trade'' of foreign goods, which saw Russian traders flood
Turkey and China, seeking consumer goods for re-sale back home.
	   Before the crisis, more than 3,000 shuttle traders each week
were going to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, said Nikolai
Kakora, director of the Midwest tour company. ``Now there are a
maximum of two flights a week.''
	   Still, travel agents were confident that the vacation bug would
return to Russia, particularly now that going abroad is becoming
the norm, not just a symbol of freedom.
	   ``People have learned to spend money on themselves, to relax,''
said Maya Donitze, editor of the TourInfo magazine. ``They've seen
the difference between Russian and European service, and they won't
give it up.''

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ After a campaign notable for its high
level of doubt, the Social Democrats were leading polls going into
national elections Sunday, but not by much.
	   Polls on Saturday showed the Social Democrats likely to get
about 38 percent of the vote for the 349 seats in the Riksdag
parliament. Although that's far short of a majority and a
significant drop from the 45 percent the party got four years ago,
most of the lost votes apparently have been siphoned off by the
Left Party.
	   With the Lefts recording support of 10 to 12 percent in recent
polls and the Greens around 5 percent, that would be enough for the
party that has governed Sweden for most of the past seven decades
to continue doing so.
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson says he doesn't want a coalition
government with those parties, but Left or Green alliances with any
of the other four parties likely to win seats is seen as anywhere
from improbable to impossible.
	   The polls also have shown about 12 percent of the 6.6 million
voters undecided in the final days of the campaign, about double
the number in previous elections.
	   In previous years, poll respondents used to ``say `I am,' but
now they say `I vote for','' Toivo Sjoeren of the SIFO polling
organization said in characterizing the decline in decisiveness.
	   It's a notable phenomenon because Swedish political style
encourages close involvement. American-style orchestrated
spectacles are rare; the characteristic event is a politician _
from city office aspirants on up to Cabinet ministers _ giving
short talks to attentive audiences in a marketplace or square, then
answering questions from the crowd.
	   But many voters' have apparently been shaken by the trials of
the 1990s, when funding for Sweden's cradle-to-grave welfare state
was slashed to try to dig the country out from under a crushing
debt.
	   The economic pragmatism of the Social Democrats over the past
four years disappointed many who had seen the party as caring,
while others remember that difficult times under the 1991-1994
non-socialist government led by the Moderates party.
	   Sweden has wrestled its way back to some extent. The government
predicts a small budget surplus this year, inflation is negligible
and unemployment is falling, although still troubling at more than
7 percent.
	   Finance Minister Erik Aasbrink said last week that ``we need a
few more years to restore the welfare state,'' but admitted that
the easy days of previous decades will never come back.
	   Moderates leader Carl Bildt says even those reduced expectations
are too high. With the world's highest tax burden, Sweden will lose
jobs in an increasingly competitive global economy and become a
stepchild of a unifying Europe, he contends.
	   But even tax-cutting conservatives aren't proposing that Sweden
take a sudden plunge. Bildt promises a tax cut of 80 billion kronor
(dlrs 10 billion) over three years _ a substantial amount for a
country of only 8.8 million people, but only enough to reduce
Sweden's tax burden to 50 percent of gross domestic product, still
one of the world's highest levels.

Union, thoug it opted out of the first round of the EU's
single-currency program.
	   A century ago, Sweden had one of Europe's most economically
divided societies, but in the 20th century developed its ``middle
way'' mix of capitalism and socialism that created a
cradle-to-grave social welfare system.
	   ___
	   INDUSTRY: Sweden is a major exporter of telecommunications
equipment, automobiles, forest products and precision machinery.
	   ___
	   ECONOMY: After a slump in the early 1990s as the costs of the
welfare state grew, Sweden has reduced unemployment from double
digits to about 7 percent. Inflation is negligible and the
government predicts a small budget surplus this year. The tax
burden, about 53 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, is the
world's highest.
	   ___
	   ELECTION: Voting is for all parliament seats and municipal and
county elections. Seven parties are expected to win parliament
seats, ranging from the ex-communist Left Party to the conservative
Christian Democrats. The Social Democrats, who have governed for
most of this century, are expected retain power. The election
campaign focused on reducing unemployment and restoring social
services.

Officials in Philippines puzzle over cause of ferry disaster

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ With more than 100 people still
missing, maritime officials puzzled Sunday over why a large
Philippine passenger ferry with 430 people aboard began tilting in
a storm and then quickly sank.
	   The Princess of the Orient had been rocked by strong waves and
winds but should have been able to withstand much worse weather,
officials said.
	   Passengers and crew among the 303 people rescued by early Sunday
said the ship sank in less than an hour _ highly unusual for a
vessel with no apparent damage.
	   Twenty-three bodies had been recovered and more than 100 people
were still missing, the coast guard said. The local governor
appealed in a radio broadcast for help in rescuing people still
floating in the chilly, storm-whipped water.
	   Carlos Go, chief executive officer of Sulpicio Lines, the owner
of the 24-year-old ship, insisted it was in seaworthy condition
despite an on board fire in 1997.
	   Sulpicio Lines also owned the Dona Paz, a ferry which collided
with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in the world's worst peacetime
shipping disaster. A year later, 250 people died in the sinking of
another ship owned by the company, the Dona Marilyn.
	   Dozens of anxious relatives waited Saturday at a coast guard
pier in Manila for two rescue ships returning with survivors.
	   Pablo Sy wept as he waited to find out whether his wife and two
sons were still alive. When he saw his wife and older son coming
off the first ship, he dashed under a restraining rope and embraced
them, still weeping because his younger son was not there. Then,
many agonizing minutes later, the younger son stepped off the
second ship.
	   ``I'm very happy now to see my family,'' Sy said.
	   Many of the survivors who floated for hours with life preservers
in the rough seas were covered in black oil from the ship, their
eyes bloodshot. Some survivors were picked up by a passing fishing
boat, while others were plucked from the water by helicopters or
navy ships.
	   One crew member, Vincente Go, said the ship began listing to the
left and would not stabilize even after the crew began pumping
ballast water from the left to the right side. Normally, large
ships pushed one direction by heavy winds or waves naturally bob
back, but Go said the Princess of the Orient refused to do so.
	   Another crew member said the ship's cargo may have suddenly
shifted to one side in the heavy seas.
	   But maritime officials said some other, still undetermined,
factor must have been involved.
	   Tropical storm Vicki was beating the northern Philippines with
75 kilometer (45 mile) per hour winds when the ship left Manila at
about 8 p.m. (1200 GMT) Friday for Cebu, about a day's journey to
the south.
	   A storm warning prohibited ships of less than 500 tons from
sailing but did not apply to the 13,734-ton ferry, coast guard
spokesman Joel Garcia said.
	   A few hours later the ship reported it was listing 25 degrees
near Fortune island off Batangas province, about 60 kilometers (40
miles) south of Manila, and then lost radio contact, the company
told naval authorities.
	   Rescue efforts were delayed for several hours because the storm
prevented rescue ships from leaving their berths, officials said.
	   The company said 338 passengers and 92 crew were aboard the
ship. No foreign names were on the ship's manifest, Garcia said.

Hurricane Georges strengthens to dangerous category 4 storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous, UPDATES with new information &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT HOFFMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Residents of the eastern Caribbean
braced Saturday for Hurricane Georges, which gained strength as it
bore down on the region's small islands with ferocious 150 mph (240
kph) winds.
	   ``Air Force reconnaissance reports indicate that Georges is now
an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane,'' the National
Hurricane Center in Miami warned.
	   At 8 p.m. EDT (0000 GMT) Saturday, the Hurricane Center said
Georges was centered at 15.8 north latitude and 55.0 west
longitude, about 420 miles (670 kilometers) east of the Lesser
Antilles.
	   Georges' clearly defined eye was moving almost due west at 18
mph (29 kph) and was expected to begin affecting the easternmost
islands Sunday morning with the center of the storm passing over
the islands later in the day.
	   Georges' sustained winds increased to 150 mph (240 kph)
Saturday, moving it up to category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale _
comparable to Hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of southern
Florida in 1992 or Hurricane Hugo which caused severe damage in the
Caribbean in 1989. Forecasters said there was a chance it could
strengthen even further.
	   Hurricane warnings were in effect from Dominica to Anguilla.
	   A hurricane watch was extended to the U.S. territory of Puerto
Rico, where 3.8 million residents in the path of the growing storm
began covering windows with plywood and stocking up on supplies
Saturday even though Georges wasn't expected to arrive until Monday
morning.
	   ``From the path I've seen on the news, it's coming on strong and
could really affect us,'' said San Juan resident Heriberto Cruz,
who was shopping Saturday for batteries, water and other
necessities.
	   On St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, residents who remember
when Hurricane Hugo damaged 95 percent of the island's homes in
1989 rushed to supermarkets and waited in long lines at gas
stations.
	   ``I am totally bewildered,'' said Josiah Mercury as she
hurriedly picked up crackers and bottled water at a supermarket.
``The most I can do is prepare and take the warning seriously.''
	   Residents of the small eastern Caribbean islands, the first ones
expected to be hit Sunday, also took the hurricane seriously,
buying extra supplies and hauling boats out of the water.
	   Jean-Jack Queyranne, the French minister of overseas
departments, sent 40 public service officers each to Martinique and
Guadeloupe to prepare for the hurricane.
	   The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency sent Early Response
Teams, which include health care workers, engineers, firefighters
and other professionals, to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico
ahead of the storm.
	   The Hurricane Center said storm surge flooding of five to 10
feet (1.5 to 3 meters) above normal tide levels should be expected
along with five to eight inches (13 to 20 centimeters) of rain,
with heavier rainfall possible in some areas.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A trailer fit for a movie queen was waiting for
Meryl Streep when she arrived in rural Ireland last summer to begin
shooting a low-budget ensemble film.
	   It was a massive, ugly aluminum thing, fully equipped and
noticeably larger than the trailers assigned each of the five other
actors. No one said a word.
	   Streep made a mental note.
	   By week's end, the trailer was gone, discreetly replaced by a
more modest one.
	   ``That's pure Meryl,'' Pat O'Connor, the director of the
forthcoming ``Dancing at Lughnasa,'' says. ``She's so likable,
she's so lacking in fussiness. That trailer bothered her.''
	   When Streep arrives for an interview, there is no pushy
entourage or yelping cell phones.
	   In fact, just the opposite. There are times when Streep acts
more like a 49-year-old soccer mom who, purely by accident, has
stumbled into a career as one of the most revered actors of her
generation who has picked up 10 Academy Award nominations, two
Oscars, a Tony and an Obie.
	   ``People think I know something that I don't know. They see me
as not who I really am,'' she says. ``It's like I'm now sort of
emeritus on some level, you know? Like Stella Adler. But I don't
know anything! And very quickly on they realize this.''
	   Wearing sensible black trousers and a red blazer over a white
T-shirt, Streep carefully ponders her responses. Ask about her
craftsmanship, and you are met with puzzlement. It's as though she
has a guilty conscience, as if at any moment the movie police might
break down the door, confiscate her Screen Actors Guild card and
frog-march her to theatrical prison.
	   ``Look, I really don't know how people act,'' she says. ``I feel
like I'm just sneaking by a lot. I have great respect for other
actors and really don't know how they do it. I really don't. It's
wonderful when you see it done right _ and that's what I crave, but
I don't know how people light upon that truth.''
	   Pardon? She's got to be kidding, right? This is, after all,
Meryl Streep _ an Academy-tested, 100 percent, Grade-A acting icon
_ confessing to cinematic ignorance. How can this be?
	   ``I think sometimes she takes herself by surprise,'' O'Connor
says, laughing. ``She can vanish into a role so far that when she
resurfaces, she doesn't know what happened!''
	   True, going deep is a big part of Streep's reputation. So deep
that it's almost distracting. After all, this is an actress who
studied both Polish and German five days a week for three months
just to do a scene in ``Sophie's Choice.''
	   She later spent 12 weeks before the filming of ``The French
Lieutenant's Woman'' perfecting a Victorian middle-class accent by
reading Jane Austen and George Eliot aloud with a voice coach.
	   And when she signed up for the role of a former white-water
rafting guide in ``The River Wild,'' Streep actually learned to
navigate Class V rapids, the category just below the level deemed
unnavigable.
	   Her resume goes on and on like that. But Carl Franklin, the
director of her latest film, ``One True Thing,'' says that Streep's
awesome ability isn't really about just being ready.
	   ``She is someone who goes through all the preparation, but I
think we're talking about something beyond that, too. There's a
gift going on: She's blessed,'' he says.
	   ``There's a certain amount of it that can be attributed to
training and preparation and being smart and all of that. Some of
it is just genius.''
	   To that, the actress just laughs. There are, she insists, no
geniuses in the Streep household, where she is instead the working
mother of four and wife of 20 years to sculptor Donald Gummer.
Besides, she's well aware that not everyone adores her.
	   ``It very rarely happens that I meet someone new without them
already having an opinion about me. I can see them running through
the reel when they meet you. Or they think: 'I just can't stand
her! I know she's a good actor, but I just can't look at her!'''
Streep shrieks in delight.
	   ``How do I know that? ... I know because I've done the same
thing about actors _ these people that we let into our brains and
our hearts when the movie's playing in the dark. You have a
visceral reaction.''
	   And it isn't always pretty. Streep admits she sometimes gets on
people's nerves with her use of accents, facial mannerisms and
self-conscious hand gestures.
	   But when critics complain that her performances are too
technical, too mechanical _ maybe even soulless _ or gripe that the
actress reveals nothing of herself in her work _ her reply is quite
simple:
	   That's why it's called acting.
	   ``I couldn't give more than I do. I think that I've shown
something that I know in each character and reveal something that
only I _ only I _ know,'' Streep says. ``I don't feel like there's
anything more I could do.''

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa went 0-for-4 to remain a home run
behind Mark McGwire in the chase for the single-season record as
the Cincinnati Reds beat the Chicago Cubs 7-2 on Saturday.
	   The loss dropped the Cubs into a tie for the National League
wild-card lead with the New York Mets, 4-3 winners over Florida.
	   Jon Nunnally homered twice and drove in four runs for the Reds,
and Jason Bere (2-2) allowed only two hits over eight innings. Mark
Clark (8-14) gave up six hits and six runs in five innings.

 &UR; Mets 4, Marlins 3 &QC; 
	   In New York, John Franco, who blew a save Friday night, struck
out Mike Redmond on a 3-2 pitch with the bases loaded as New York
held off Florida.

Marlins within a run and chased Masato Yoshii (6-8). Turk Wendell
worked 1 2-3 innings, and Franco pitched the ninth for his 38th
save.
	   Jesus Sanchez (7-9) took the loss.
	   New York's John Olerud went 3-for-3 to raise his average to
.352. He has an RBI single in the second inning.
 &UR; Giants 18, Dodgers 4 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Bill Mueller and Jeff Kent hit grand slams as
San Francisco beat Los Angeles to move within three games of the
leaders in the NL wild-card race.
	   Mueller's first career slam capped a seven-run third inning.
Kent's seventh career slam, his second of the season, completed a
six-run fourth. He tied his career high set last season with his
29th homer.
	   Brian Johnson and Doug Mirabelli also homered for the Giants.
	   Russ Ortiz (3-4) allowed four runs on 11 hits in 6 1-3 innings

	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Manny Ramirez hit his 44th and 45th homers, but
the Cleveland bullpen failed to hold a six-run lead as the Indians
dropped a 7-6 decision to the Kansas City Royals on Saturday.
	   Ramirez's homers gave him a major league-record eight in five
games, tying the mark reached twice by Washington's Frank Howard in
1968.
	   The Royals scratched out the winning run in the ninth off Paul
Shuey (5-3) to snap Cleveland's six-game winning streak.
	   Scott Service (6-3) pitched one scoreless inning and Jeff
Montgomery worked the ninth for his 35th save.
 &UR; White Sox 5, Red Sox 2 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Mike Cameron hit a three-run homer as Chicago beat
Boston despite getting only five hits.
	   Pedro Martinez (18-7) lost his third straight start, allowing
seven hits and two earned runs with three walks and nine strikeouts
in seven innings.
	   John Snyder (7-2) won his third straight decision, allowing six
hits over six innings with one walk and three strikeouts.
	   Darren Lewis homered for Boston.
 &UR; Orioles 5, Yankees 3 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Orioles rookie Sidney Ponson ruined New York star
David Cone's second try at his 20th victory.
	   Ponson (8-8) allowed six hits in 7 1-3 scoreless innings,
walking two and striking out five. In his previous start against
New York, the right-hander allowed two hits over 6 2-3 shutout
innings on June 16 for his first major league victory.
	   Cone (19-7), looking to match his career high in victories,
allowed 12 hits and five runs in eight innings.
	   Alan Mills got the last three outs for his second save.
 &UR; Tigers 8, Twins 7, 10 innings &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Damion Easley hit a game-winning homer for the
second time in three days, a two-run shot in the 10th inning, as
Detroit won its third straight.
	   Easley followed Tony Clark's leadoff single with his 26th homer
off Rick Aguilera (3-9). Easley went 3-for-5 with two doubles, two
RBIs and three runs scored.
	   Minnesota's Paul Molitor was 3-for-5 with a homer and three
RBIs, extending his hitting streak to 16 games.
	   The loss extended the Twins' losing streak to 10 games.

British actress Patricia Hayes dies aged 88
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British comic actress Patricia Hayes, a star of
many popular British television shows, has died at age 88.
	   Miss Hayes died on Saturday at a nursing home, her son, Richard
O'Callaghan, said early Sunday.
	   ``She had been in the nursing home for a while and died very
peacefully,'' he said. ``All her family were with her when she
passed away.''
	   The cause of death was not given.
	   In a career spanning 70 years, Miss Hayes appeared in many films
and television programs, often in comic character parts.
	   A tiny woman of energy and warmth, she was best known for her
portrayal of high-pitched cockney characters and won her greatest
acclaim in the title role of the television play ``Edna, the
Inebriate Woman.'' The role won her a 1972 British Academy Award
from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.
	   In recent years she became best known for a string of
performances in television programs such as ``Till Death Us Do
Part,'' ``Spooners Patch,'' ``Pat and Dandy,'' ``The Lady is a
Tramp'' and ``In Sickness and in Health.''
	   Her films included ``Nicholas Nickleby'' in 1946, ``Goodbye Mr.
Chips,'' in 1969, ``The Never Ending Story'' in 1984, and ``Little
Dorrit'' in 1987.
	   In 1987, Queen Elizabeth II made Miss Hayes an OBE, or Officer
of the Order of British Empire.
	   In addition to her son, she is survived by two daughters.
	   Funeral plans were not immediately announced.

	   The Clinton grand jury testimony, the Lewinsky testimony and the
rest of the 2,800 pages of Starr documents will be made public by
the House Judiciary Committee when the Clinton videotape is
released at approximately 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT) Monday.
	   The Government Printing Office is printing the materials in
bound form.
	   Sometime after the printed transcripts are distributed _ how
much longer is not known _ we expect to get the materials
electronically.
	   We are planning a variety of news stories after the release.
Moving will be a mainbar, a color story and several sidebars on
merit.
	   Because of the volume, the full texts of the testimony and
documents will not move on regular news wires.
	   Instead, once they are in electronic form, we will provide the
full texts in ASCII and HTML formats at an ftp site. We have
arranged for an ftp server with additional capacity to handle the
expected demand. This means the files will not be at the same
address used to deliver the Starr report last week.
	   We will send an advisory Sunday with the address of the ftp
server and a number to call Monday to get the username and
password. The username and password will NOT be available before
then.
	   Running excerpts will move on regular news wires in two
versions, a long and a short. We cannot estimate wordage until we
see the documents. The excerpts will be edited; much of the
sexually graphic detail may be deleted and any that remains will be
carefully flagged.
	   The full transcripts on the ftp site and will be unedited and
will move in the official form provided by the House Judiciary
Committee.
	   Edited video clips in RealVideo and QuickTime formats from the
videotape of President Clinton's testimony will also be available
at the ftp site.
	   Additionally, we will post the text files and video excerpts on
The WIRE, the AP's public Web site that is displayed by newspaper
and broadcast sites around the world.
	   APTV, the AP's international video service that provides video
to 200 broadcasters in the United States and abroad, plans to carry
the video in full, unedited, as soon as it is made available.

Queen Elizabeth II visits Malaysia during political storm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The state visit of Queen Elizabeth
II, which begins Sunday, has been threatened by a political
bombshell that could explode during her visit.
	   After a highly successful three-day visit to the tiny kingdom of
Brunei, the queen and her husband, Prince Philip, were due to
arrive in the capital of this former British colony Sunday to begin
their first state visit since 1989.
	   But this Southeast Asian nation is embroiled in an ugly
political clash that could sully the queen's visit.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's sacked deputy, Anwar Ibrahim,
has accused his former mentor of ordering witnesses tortured in a
court case against him.
	   Anwar, who was fired as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on Sept. 2, said Saturday that his adopted brother and a
friend were tortured into confessing that he had sodomized them.
	   Police have said they are investigating Anwar on allegations of
unlawful sex acts, leaking state secrets and abusing his powers.
	   Anwar, 51, married with six children, has vehemently denied the
allegations. He said Mahathir instigated the accusations because he
feared his deputy's challenge to his 17-year leadership.
	   Meanwhile, the sacked deputy has scheduled a rally in the
capital's huge Independence Square at the same time the queen is
scheduled to visit a nearby cathedral Sunday. Most of Anwar's
rallies have been attended by thousands of cheering supporters.
	   The queen and Prince Philip will also visit athletes who are
competing in the 16th Commonwealth Games, the first ever to be held
in Asia. The queen, as the head of the Commonwealth, will close the
games at a ceremony Monday.
	   The royal couple will also attend a state banquet in their honor
and make visits to the tallest skyscraper in the world, an
exhibition highlighting British industry and a recording studio to
meet with Malaysian pop music stars.
	   Prince Philip, an avid environmentalist, will visit the World
Wide Fund for Nature's Education Center in a national park outside
the capital.

Aboriginal star earns track title to go with Oly hockey gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The first Aboriginal to win an
Olympic gold medal, Nova Peris-Kneebone had 10 team-mates helping
her on the field hockey field in Atlanta.
	   Reaching a solo Commonwealth Games gold on the track was a long
and winding road.
	   Peris-Kneebone made a late charge to the line to steal the 200
meter title from under the nose of experienced Jamaican Juliet
Campbell Saturday, beating her by .02 in 22.77 seconds.
	   Uncertain that she had won, she had to see it to believe it.
	   ``I had no idea. I wanted to see it up on the scoreboard,'' the
Australian said. ``I knew it was extremely close.
	   ``It's like when I won my hockey gold medal, I just couldn't
believe it until later on.
	   ``It's unreal. I'm going to have to sit down by myself and think
about it. It hasn't sunk in yet.''
	   While the race took her less than 23 seconds, the route to the
Games took many twists and turns for the 27-year-old from Darwin,
one of few Aboriginals to make it in international sport.
	   Peris-Kneebone took Athletics Australia to court last month in a
bid to run in the Commonwealth 100 meters.
	   At the time she was only down to run the 4x100 relay and claimed
a 100m place on the basis that she had a qualifying time and a
runner who beat her in the trials, Tania Van Heer, didn't.
	   She lost her case but then was chosen for the 100 when Melinda
Gainsford-Taylor, Australia's biggest 100 hope, was injured.
	   She then gained a 200m place when world 400m titlist Cathy
Freeman withdrew with injury.
	   After finishing sixth in the 100, ironically two behind Van
Heer, she made her big impact in the 200. Although three
Australians finished in the first four but it was Peris-Kneebone
who had the gold medal.
	   ``It's unbelievable. As I say, from opportunity comes success -
that's a message to all you Australian kids out there,'' she said.
	   ``I knew within myself that a medal was there and I did it when
it counted.''

Turland win's women's marathon for Australia, Lesotho gain's first

gold in men's race &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: will be updated by 1300 GMT with Sunday's track finals &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Heather Turland, a 38-year-old
mother of five who only started running in her early 30s, led an
Australian 1-2 in the women's marathon at the Commonwealth Games
Sunday.
	   After finishing in 2 hours 41 minutes 24 seconds she was hugged
by one of her sons at the finish line before the whole family
joined in the celebrations.
	   Lisa Dick came home second, 25 seconds behind but ahead of
Namibia's Elizabeth Monghudi, a one time leader.
	   Thabiso Moqhabi pulled away from the field four miles (6.4
kilometers) from home in the men's race to win Lesotho's first
Commonwealth Games gold.
	   Tanzania's Simon Bisiligitwa and Andea Suja made it an African
sweep of the men's medals on the streets of Kuala Lumpur by placing
second and third in a slow run race in the early morning sunshine.
	   Turland led the women's race of only 12 starters for a long
spell before she was joined by Mongudhi, who edged past her 10
miles (16 kilometers).
	   The Namibian tried to pull away but the Australian moved back on
her shoulder and regained the lead. Although Mongudhi tried to get
back, Turland had too much strength and pulled confidently away and
the fading Namibian was caught by Dick in the last two miles.
	   After 26 runners started out in the men's race, England's David
Taylor made the early move in the men's race until he was caught by
a pack of six runners.
	   Moqhabi kicked ahead in the last quarter of the race and the
runner from Lesotho made a decisive break after 20 miles (32 kms).
	   The rest of the field were unable to respond and Moqhabi wasn't
challenged in the final stages of the race as he crossed the line
in 2 hours 19 minutes and 15 seconds.

With democracy party labeled illegal, activists detained in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Crushing the slight hope Chinese dissidents had
of organizing an opposition party, authorities have declared the
party illegal and arrested an activist who traveled around the
country trying to get it started, a rights group said Sunday.
	   Tang Yuanjuan, who had visited several cities trying to help
organize the China Democracy Party, has been sent to a detention
center in Changchun on a charge of having contacts with an illegal
organization, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said.
	   Police took Tang away from the Beijing home of longtime
democracy activist Xu Wenli on Friday, transported him to his home
city of Changchun in northeastern China and are holding him in a
detention center there, the rights group said in a statement.
Authorities on Saturday notified his family about the detention and
charge, it said.
	   Earlier this month activists in two provinces were encouraged
when Civil Affairs Ministry officials did not immediately reject
their efforts to register the opposition party.
	   Chinese law requires all organizations must be approved by the
government. The ruling Communist Party has never allowed an
opposition group to form.
	   The charge against Tang ``sends a very strong signal,'' Xu said.
	   Activists believed Tang was doing nothing illegal and were
trying to find a way to protest his detention, he added.
	   The Hong Kong rights group said Tang had traveled to various
cities to meet with activists trying to set up the opposition
party.
	   Tang was one of several workers at Changchun's First Auto Works
who were jailed for organizing sympathy protests with the Tiananmen
Square demonstrations in Beijing in 1989. A court later commuted
his sentence of 20 years to eight, and he was released last year.
	   Other dissidents trying to register the China Democracy Party
also have been detained in recent days. Among them was Han Lifa,
who was held for six hours after authorities rejected his group's
efforts on Friday to register the party in Shanghai, the rights
group said.

Allen wins interim middleweight championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER Jr. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Robert Allen won the interim WBC middleweight
championship by stopping former sparring partner Abdul Ramadan in
the first round Saturday night in the Georgia Dome.
	   The left-handed Allen hurt Ramadan with two right hands to the
head and followed with a flurry. Ramadan turned his back and
grabbed hold of the ropes, and referee Jim Korb gave him a
mandatory eight-count.
	   When action resumed, Allen landed another barrage and once again
Ramadan turned his back in a neutral corner. Allen looked at the
referee and then threw another flurry before Korb stepped in and
stopped it at 2:46.
	   The fight was on the undercard of Evander Holyfield's WBA-IBF
heavyweight title defense against Vaughn Bean.
	   Allen, 23-2 with 18 knockouts, becomes interim champion until
champion Bernard Hopkins recovers from a sprained ankle he suffered
when referee Mills Lane accidentally pushed him out of the ring in
a fight against Allen on Aug. 28. That fight was declared a
no-contest.
	   If Hopkins elects to defend the title again, he must fight
Allen. If he moves up to super middleweight, Allen becomes
champion.
	   In two other fights, John Ruiz of Chelsea, Massachusetts,
stopped Jerry Ballard of Washington in the fourth round of a
12-round heavyweight match.
	   And, Jorge Eliecer Julio of Colombia retained the WBO
bantamweight title on a unanimous decision over Adonis Cruz of
Nicaragua.
	   ``Everything I threw I caught him with,'' Ruiz said in an
understatement.
	   In the fourth round, Ruiz, 228, drove Ballard back with a
six-punch barrage to the head, then staggered him with a
seven-punch flurry and finally put him down with an eight-punch
barrage capped by two overhand rights, two right uppercuts and an
overhand right.
	   Ballard, 224, staggered up but fell into the ropes and the fight
was stopped.
	   ``It's the biggest win of my career,'' Ruiz said. ``Hopefully it
will give me a chance with the big man _ Holyfield.''
	   Eliecer Julio took charge in the second half of the fight,
wearing down Cruz with body shots and doing damage in close,
especially with right uppercuts.
	   Eliecer Julio, 117 1-2, won by eight points on each of two cards
and by nine on the third as he boosted his record to 40-1 with 30
knockouts. Cruz, 117 1-2, now is 29-4-1 with 16 knockouts.
	   After the fight, Eliecer Julio called for a match against Johnny
Tapia, the WBO and IBF junior bantamweight champion.
	   In a women's bout scheduled for 10 rounds, Christy Martin, 141
1-2, of Orlando, Florida, stopped Christine Robinson, 144, of
Sylva, North Carolina, in the fifth with a barrage of punches to
the head.

	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Mark McGwire was 0-for-4 in the St. Louis
Cardinals' 7-4 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday night,
striking out four times and getting hit by a pitch.
	   McGwire, who struck out four times in a game for the first time
this season, has 64 homers, one ahead of Chicago's Sammy Sosa.
McGwire has left the plate without making contact 311 times this
season: an NL-record 156 walks, 149 strikeouts and six times when
he was hit by a pitch.
	   McGwire was plunked in the ribs by Steve Woodard (10-12) in the
first, right after Brian Jordan hit his 24th homer.
	   Fernando Tatis hit his seventh homer and pinch-hitter John Mabry
had a two-run double to put the Cardinals ahead 5-4 in the fifth.
Delino DeShields had a run-scoring single and Jordan had an RBI
single in the sixth.
	   Jose Jimenez (2-0) was the winner, and Juan Acevedo got his 12th
save.
 &UR; Reds 7, Cubs 2 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa was 0-for-4 to remain a homer behind Mark
McGwire in the chase for the single-season record as Cincinnati
beat Chicago.
	   The loss dropped the Cubs into a tie for the NL wild-card lead
with the New York Mets, 4-3 winners over Florida.
	   Jon Nunnally homered twice and drove in four runs for the Reds,
and Jason Bere (2-2) allowed only two hits over eight innings. Mark
Clark (8-14) gave up six hits and six runs in five innings.
	   Sosa, stuck on 63 homers, struck out three times and grounded
into a double play to end the game.
 &UR; Mets 4, Marlins 3 &QC; 
	   In New York, John Franco, who blew a save Friday night, struck
out Mike Redmond on a 3-2 pitch with the bases loaded as New York
held off Florida.
	   Mark Kotsay's two-run homer in the seventh had pulled the
Marlins within a run and chased Masato Yoshii (6-8). Turk Wendell
worked 1 2-3 innings, and Franco pitched the ninth for his 38th
save.
	   Jesus Sanchez (7-9) took the loss.
	   New York's John Olerud went 3-for-3 to raise his average to
.352. He has an RBI single in the second inning.
 &UR; Giants 18, Dodgers 4 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Bill Mueller and Jeff Kent hit grand slams as
San Francisco beat Los Angeles to move within three games of the
leaders in the NL wild-card race.
	   Mueller's first career slam capped a seven-run third inning.
Kent's seventh career slam, his second of the season, completed a
six-run fourth. He tied his career high set last season with his
29th homer.
	   Brian Johnson and Doug Mirabelli also homered for the Giants.
	   Russ Ortiz (3-4) allowed four runs on 11 hits in 6 1-3 innings
for the Giants. Ismael Valdes (10-10) was the loser.
 &UR; Phillies 4, Expos 3 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Kevin Sefcik hit an RBI single in the eighth
inning to push Philadelphia past Montreal.
	   Curt Schilling (15-14) allowed five hits, struck out nine and
walked two in his major league-leading 15th complete game. He
struck out the side in the ninth to increase his strikeout total to
293, the best in the NL.
	   Mike Maddux (3-4) was the loser.
	   Derrick May homered for Montreal, and Bobby Abreu connected for
Philadelphia.
 &UR; Pirates 7, Astros 1 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Jose Guillen hit a three-run homer and doubled in

	   Lisa Dick came home second, 24 seconds behind but ahead of
Namibia's Elizabeth Monghudi, a one-time leader. Monghudi finished
in 2:43:28.
	   Thabiso Moqhabi pulled away from the field four miles (6.4
kilometers) from home in the men's race to win Lesotho's first
Commonwealth Games gold. He finished in 2 hours, 19 minutes, 15
seconds.
	   Tanzania's Simon Bisiligitwa and Andea Suja made it an African
sweep of the men's medals on the streets of Kuala Lumpur by placing
second and third in 2:19:42 and 2:19:50 in a slow race in the early
morning sunshine.
	   Turland led the women's race of only 12 starters for a long
spell before she was joined by Mongudhi, who edged past her after
10 miles (16 kilometers).
	   The Namibian tried to pull away but the Australian moved back on
her shoulder and regained the lead. Although Mongudhi tried to get
back, Turland had too much strength and pulled confidently away and
the fading Namibian was caught by Dick in the last two miles.
	   After 26 runners started out in the men's race, England's David
Taylor made the early move until he was caught by a pack of six
runners.
	   Moqhabi kicked ahead in the last quarter of the race and the
runner from Lesotho made a decisive break after 20 miles (32 kms).
	   The rest of the field were unable to respond and Moqhabi wasn't
challenged in the final stages of the race.
	   Taylor finished fourth in 2:20:30.

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Round-by-round description of Evander Holyfield's
WBA-IBF heavyweight title defense Saturday night against challenger
Vaughn Bean:
	   Round 1: The two fighters met in the center of the ring and
exchanged short jabs. Bean got in a short right to the body.
Holyfield missed with a three-punch flurry, but the crowd roared a
little anyway. Bean was circling away, Holyfield got in a left and
right to the head at the 45- second mark, then just missed with a
right to the head and got in a stiff jab, then two stiff lefts to
the body with 2 minutes left in the round. Holyfield was stalking.
Holyfield got in a right to the head at midround, a hard right to
the body. Bean got in a short left to the head that had no power
behind it at 1:50. Action then slowed. Holyfield seemed to be
looking for the big punch. Bean got in a left to the body,
Holyfield a left to the head. Holyfield dealt two punches to the
head and two to the body about 10 seconds before the bell.
	   The AP gives the round to Holyfield.

	   Round 5: Holyfield landed a left to the head, then missed badly

outweighed him. Bean got in a good right to the head, then a right
to the body as Holyfield missed. Bean got in a right high to the
head just past the one minute mark, then another right. Bean threw

round. Bean landed a hard left to the head, and Holyfield came back
at him. Holyfield landed a right to the chin before they clinched

in Bean's corner. Holyfield came out dancing, but not punching.
Bean got in the first punch, a left to the body. Almost nothing
happened in the first minute of the round. Bean then got in a good
right, and Holyfield came back with three rights before the referee
got in the way. Holyfield has had the best of the fight, but he did
not appear particularly sharp. Bean landed a few more, including
two lefts to the body. Bean got in a hard right at 2:25, and

body with about 10 seconds left. Bean missed with a roundhouse

Holyfield, landing two body punches as he backed the champ to the
ropes. Bean got in a left to the face as Holyfield missed, and Bean

got in a right to the body, and seemed to be beating Holyfield to
the punch. Holyfield landed a light right to the head, and Bean
answered with a right to the head. Holyfield landed a hook to the
jaw that might have hurt Bean with about 30 seconds left. Bean then
grabbed. Both men exchanged punches, but were wild.
