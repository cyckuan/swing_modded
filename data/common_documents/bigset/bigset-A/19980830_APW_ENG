Kim Beazley: The new face of Labor in Australia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Labor leader Kim Beazley, an amateur
historian, welcomed President Bill Clinton on his visit to
Australia in 1996 by reminding him that he is the first Southern
Democrat since the end of the U.S. Civil War to win a second
presidential term.
	   This brief but memorable speech was a minor triumph for Beazley.
Until then, he had been finding it hard to establish a distinct
presence either as Labor or opposition leader.
	   Beazley had not then emerged from the shadows of two
better-known Labor prime ministers, former union boss Bob Hawke and
the svelte but sarcastic Paul Keating, whose trademark arrogance
led to a landslide loss for Labor in March 1996.
	   Australia's then-new conservative Prime Minister John Howard,
who also made a formal welcoming speech for Clinton on the same
occasion in the main hall of Parliament, had been basking in the
afterglow of his election victory just eight months earlier.
	   Beazley, who won't turn 50 till December this year, has had a
very long apprenticeship in politics.
	   He is both a former defense minister and deputy prime minister
in the previous Labor government of former prime minister Paul
Keating.
	   His deep and abiding interest in military strategy has earned
him the nickname ``Bomber Beazley'' among his colleagues.
	   His father, the widely respected Kim Beazley Sr., was education
minister in the Labor government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in
the early 1970s.
	   As a boy, the young Kim Beazley often traveled with his father
from their home in the West Australian capital of Perth to
Australia's national capital of Canberra, almost 2,500 miles (4,000
km) away.
	   Family friend Jim Killen, a senior member of the government of
conservative prime minister Robert Menzies would take young Kim to
the cinema on some Saturdays.
	   Killen was one of Parliament's most accomplished post war
raconteurs, and the young Beazley took advantage of the opportunity
to polish his own rhetorical skills.
	   Kim Beazley later won masters' degrees both from the University
of Western Australia and Oxford in England, where he was a Rhodes
scholar.
	   His first marriage was to Mary, daughter of Shane Paltridge,
civil aviation minister in the Menzies government.
	   That marriage was dissolved in 1989 and Beazley now lives with
his second wife, Susannah, and their children, in Perth.
	   Beazley, a big man who struggles to keep his quite substantial
weight under control, lists swimming and reading as recreations.
	   He has tried hard to cut his weight, mainly through exercise.
	   But he frankly admits that a tough swimming session leaves him
``as hungry as a horse.''
	   Beazley won his present seat of Brand, along a coastal strip
south of Western Australia's main port of Fremantle, by the
narrowest of margins in 1996.
	   Party colleagues fear that the rise of the populist anti-Asian
and anti-Aboriginal One Nation party, led by Pauline Hanson, might
threaten his political survival in the coming election by costing
him his own district.

Pauline Hanson: Right-wing wild card in Australian election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Former fish-and-chip shop owner
Pauline Hanson is the wild card in Australia's election.
	   She leads a right-wing populist party that has a chance of
winning the balance of power in the Senate.
	   Her One Nation party came close to doing just that last June in
Queensland's state election, attracting 23 percent of the statewide
vote and capturing 11 of the 89 seats in state parliament.
	   Hanson, an independent member of federal Parliament who
maintains Asian immigrants steal jobs and refuse to assimilate,
says she merely voices the secret wish of many white Australians:
an end to Asian immigration and to privileges for Australia's
indigenous people, the Aborigines.
	   Hanson appeals to some middle-class Australians who blame
immigrants for tough economic times, including relatively high
unemployment that reaches 30 percent in some rural areas where
Hanson-mania flourishes.
	   Others, however, say her views threaten progress toward
multiculturalism in a country that only in 1973 repealed a
100-year-old law effectively blocking Asian immigrants in favor of
Europeans.
	   Hanson's maiden speech to Parliament in September 1996 _ a call
to keep out immigrants _ attracted world attention. She claimed
Australia will be swamped with Asians by 2040.
	   In her book, ``Pauline Hanson: The Truth,'' she warned that
Australia's president in 2050 will be ``Poona Li Hung,'' a
``lesbian of Indian and Chinese background ... a part machine ...
produced by a joint Korean-Indian-Chinese research team.''
	   She also alleged Aborigines ate their babies and elderly like
livestock, a claim that outraged aboriginal groups and that top
Australian historians debunked.
	   Aborigines, Hanson said, didn't deserve sympathy for their poor
status in Australian society.
	   Hanson, a 43-year-old divorcee, sold her fish-and-chips shop to
launch a right-wing populist political party last year, ``Pauline
Hanson's One Nation.''
	   Australia eliminated its White Australia Policy in 1973, in part
to find an economic and political home in Asia.
	   White Australia today is a taboo concept, for many a shameful
relic of the past. But Hanson is urging Australians to shed the
guilt.
	   ``I am fed up with political correctness,'' she said on
Australian television. ``People are in fear of opening their mouths
for fear of being called racist.''

Capital brought to standstill by massive anti-Hun Sen protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The largest demonstration in memory
brought Cambodia's capital to a standstill Sunday when 15,000
people marched through the streets demanding the ouster of leader
Hun Sen, deepening Cambodia's political turmoil.
	   Though largely peaceful, the protest developed racial overtones
when a statue of Vietnamese soldiers _ who occupied the country
between 1979 and 1989 _ was smashed and burned after the march
concluded outside the National Assembly.
	   The march, preceded by a rally at the city's main sports
stadium, capped an unprecedented round-the-clock vigil since last
Monday by thousands of people objecting to Hun Sen's declared
victory in parliamentary elections a month ago.
	   Traffic police stood by helplessly as crowds swarmed past them
on foot, motorbikes and pedicabs, cheering, clapping and beeping
their horns. No arrests were reported.
	   ``Down with the despicable Hun Sen! Down with the Yuon dictator
regime!'' protesters shouted as the march passed Hun Sen's
residence in Phnom Penh, where he seldom stays.
	   Yuon is a derogatory term for Vietnamese. Though Vietnam's
invasion toppled the genocidal Khmer Rouge, many Cambodians regard
their neighbors with suspicion and hate. Hun Sen came to power
during the harsh occupation and many consider him too pro-Hanoi.
	   The march ended at a park, dubbed ``Democracy Square,'' outside
the National Assembly where a small city of makeshift tents has
housed thousands of people for a week calling for Hun Sen to step
down and demanding alleged election irregularities be investigated.
	   A Vietnamese occupation-era statue in the center of the park was
attacked by a dozen demonstrators, who smashed it with hammers,
poured fuel on it and set it afire.
	   The opposition leaders whose parties officially lost the
elections, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, frequently
played on deep anti-Vietnamese sentiments during the election
campaign.
	   Hun Sen emerged the victor from the vote, but the opposition
refused to accept the result. The campaign was marred by violence
and intimidation against their supporters, and they alleged
hundreds of voting and counting irregularities.
	   The Hun Sen-packed National Election Committee has rejected
their charges as ``baseless.'' The Hun Sen-controlled
Constitutional Council, the country's highest appeals body, is to
issue a final ruling by Wednesday.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority of 64
of the 122 National Assembly seats, not enough for the two-thirds
majority needed to endorse a new government.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party threaten to
boycott the assembly and have refused offers to join a coalition,
meaning Cambodia could have no legal government when the assembly
meets for the first time Sept. 24.
	   Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-premier last year in a bloody
coup. The prince won U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993, but Hun Sen
muscled his way into a tense coalition by threatening renewed civil
war.
	   The recent elections were intended by Hun Sen to cement his
power and win back international aid and legitimacy. Instead, the
result has been to deepen hostility to his continued rule.

Flood waters surge downstream on China's Yangtze River
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's flood control headquarters sent an urgent
appeal to soldiers and civilians already worn down from a
summer-long battle against floods, urging them Sunday to keep up
the fight.
	   Another flood crest rolled down the Yangtze River, China's
longest river. It has been hit by the heaviest flooding since 1954,
when more than 30,000 people were killed.
	   This year's floods have killed more than 3,000 people, 1,320 of
them along the 3,900-mile- (6,200-kilometer-) long Yangtze.
	   The latest flood crest, the eighth this summer, passed Chongqing
in southwest China, and waters were rising in Yichang, in central
China's Hubei province, on the middle reaches of the Yangtze, state
television reported Sunday.
	   Flood control officials urged the millions of people patrolling
important dikes along the river and on Dongting Lake to work hard
guarding danger points, People's Daily reported Sunday.
	   The dikes have been weakened and waterlogged after more than two
months of floods that have left millions of people homeless.
	   The floods since mid-June have affected 2.1 million hectares of
farmland nationwide, according to official figures.
	   Agriculture experts have been mobilized to advise farmers on how
to save late rice and cotton crops where waters have receded and to
provide seeds for cash crops to help farmers make up for lost
income, the China Daily reported.
	   In addition to the heavily populated Yangtze basin, China's
unusually heavy summer floods have struck on rivers in the
northeast and in Tibet.
	   After many years of rapid growth at the expense of the
environment, China is being forced by this year's severe flooding
to acknowledge the costs of environmental devastation.
	   Officials have pointed out that deforestation along the Yangtze
has worsened the flooding. With no trees to soak up the water, soil
erodes from hillsides and silts up river beds.
	   In addition, human encroachment on wetlands has reduced their
ability to absorb floodwaters.
	   In Tibet, floods have hit 40 of the region's more than 70
counties, destroying 2,000 houses, killing livestock and ruining
crops.
	   Major rivers in Tibet were at record levels, and forecasters
said more torrential rains were expected.

<TEXT>
	   In Phoenix, Fernando Vina committed two errors in the ninth
inning to allow Arizona to rally past Milwaukee for the
Diamondbacks' second victory in 80 games when trailing after eight
innings.
	   Bob Wickman (6-8) walked Tony Batista to open the inning. Devon
White followed with a sacrifice bunt that Wickman fielded and threw
to Vina covering first, but White was safe when Vina dropped the
ball.
	   Travis Lee singled to load the bases and the Brewers brought the
infield in. Matt Williams hit a grounder to second and Vina tagged
out Lee as Batista scored. Vina then wheeled and threw wildly to
home allowing White to score.
	   Aaron Small (2-0) pitched a perfect ninth for the victory.
	   Batista homered for Arizona, and Jeromy Burnitz and Dave Nilsson
connected for Milwaukee.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Confident of his success in
maintaining Australia's relative prosperity amid Asia's economic
crisis, Prime Minister John Howard on Sunday called an early
national election for Oct. 3.
	   ``I am very proud of the record of economic and other
achievement of the government that I lead,'' Howard said, adding
that tax reform will be the centerpiece of his campaign.
	   He also pointed to how his administration had turned a budget
deficit it inherited into a surplus in less than three years,
despite the Asian crisis.
	   ``The important thing is that we would have been affected a lot
worse if we hadn't have got rid of that 10.5 billion dollar (U.S.
dlrs 6 billion) deficit,'' he said.
	   ``And we will be affected a lot more in the future if we don't
fix our tax system.''
	   Howard's governing conservatives want to introduce a 10 percent
goods and services tax, but are sweetening that proposal by cutting
personal income taxes and many sales taxes.
	   The opposition Labor Party, led by Kim Beazley, has proposed
more limited tax reforms and offered tax cuts aimed mainly at its
traditional blue-collar working class constituency.
	   The Labor Party would not introduce a goods and services tax,
however. Labor won a landslide victory in the 1993 election by
campaigning against the introduction of such a tax then.
	   Labor has been ahead in opinion polls for most of the year. But
Howard's government has gained ground since it released its plan to
overhaul the nation's tax system earlier this month.
	   Under the constitution, Howard's government, elected in 1996,
had until next May to call an election.
	   But the economic effects of the Asian crisis are beginning to
filter into Australia, harming commodity exports and tourism. The
sooner Howard called the election, the better to avoid the
worsening effects of the regional problem.
	   The Russian financial collapse has also hit the economy of
Australia, along with the rest of the the world. The share market
has dropped and the Australian dollar has fallen by a penny to
about U.S. 57 cents in the last week.
	   ``We are on two different chessboards, John Howard and me. He is
talking about bribes, unsustainable to the current economic
circumstances _ bribes to persuade people to support a bad
dead-hand tax on the economy,'' Beazley told TV Network Ten.
	   ``Every Australian knows next year is going to be a year of
great economic difficulty for this nation.''
	   An October election will also be the first federal test for
Pauline Hanson's fledgling One Nation right-wing populist party,
which made major inroads into the major parties' vote in the
Queensland state election in June.
	   In the current House of Representatives, Howard's governing
Liberal Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the
Labor Party holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's
Country Liberal Party, 1.
	   The Labor Party has to win 27 seats to return to government,
which is formed out of the House of Representatives.
	   Half of the 76-member Senate will also be up for grabs.
	   One Nation has a chance of winning enough Senate seats to hold
the balance of power there, where it could block legislation it
opposes, such as gun control, welfare for Aborigines or loosening
Asian immigration restrictions.
	   Howard insisted Sunday, ``I will make no deals in government
with One Nation.''
	   There are about 11.7 million voters among Australia's 18 million
people.

Rains in China swell Russian rivers

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A river on the border between Russia and China has
overflowed, flooding 20,000 hectares (nearly 50,000 acres) of
farmland in Russia's Far East, a news agency reported Sunday.
	   Waters rose in the Amur River after one of its Chinese
tributaries, the Sungari River, flooded following torrential rains,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   The farmland now under water in the Khabarovsk and Jewish
Autonomous regions of Russia includes 540 hectares (1,330 acres)
planted with crops, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The flood is expected to crest on Sunday, it said, quoting the
Ministry for Emergency Situations reports.

	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ Sandra Hunt, one of the first women
to serve as a senior referee in an MLS game, ejected a player from
each team Saturday night and the Chicago Fire beat the Kansas City
Wizards 3-2 in a shootout.
	   While Hunt made her debut, Nancy Lay did the same in the game
between the New York-New Jersey MetroStars and the Burn in Dallas.
	   The MLS joined the NBA as the only professional sports leagues
to have women serve as senior game officials as Hunt, 39, of
Bellingham, Wash., and Lay each worked their first games.
	   Hunt, who has been a line judge in several MLS games, has
officiated about 1,000 games in an 11-year career at the youth,
collegiate, professional and national team levels.
	   Jerzy Podbrozny capped Chicago's rally from a 2-0 deficit by
scoring the tying goal in the 90th minute and the Fire won the
shootout 3-2.
	   Hunt ejected Kansas City captain Mo Johnston and Chicago
defender C.J. Brown for violent conduct in the 64th minute, forcing
both teams to finish the game with 10 men.
	   Ante Razov beat goalkeeper Chris Snitko of the Wizards (11-16)
to take a 3-2 lead in the shootout and Zach Thornton then saved
Digital Takawira's shot to preserve the win for the Fire (16-10).
 &UR; Burn 2, MetroStars 0
	   In Dallas, a game as noteworthy for the referee as the players,
the Dallas Burn scored twice in the final 18 minutes Saturday night
to beat the New York-New Jersey MetroStars 2-0.
	   Nancy Lay, an elementary school physical education teacher from
Plantation, Fla., became one of the first two women to referee an
MLS game. Sandra Hunt refereed Saturday night's game between the
Chicago Fire and Wizards in Kansas City.
	   Lay was in the spotlight in the first half when she ejected Burn
defender Chad Deering for a rough tackle in the 30th minute. Dallas
had to play a man short the rest of the game. She handed out five
cautions, ranging from dangerous play to dissent.
	   After 72 minutes of scoreless play, midfielder Jason Kreiss
chipped a ball over MetroStars goalkeeper Tony Meola to give Dallas
the lead.
	   With just three minutes remaining, defender Jorge Rodriguez
padded the Dallas lead, with assists from Leonel Alvarez and Dante
Washington.
	   Mark Dodd had four saves to record the shutout for the Burn.
 &UR; Mutiny 3, United 2, SO
	   In TAmpa, Florida, Evans Wise scored the lone goal and Thomas
Ravelli made four saves during the shootout as the Tampa Bay Mutiny
stopped D.C. United's nine-game winning streak with a 3-2 victory
Saturday night.
	   United's last lost was on June 25, 3-1 at Colorado.
	   The Mutiny trail Miami by four points for the final Eastern
Conference playoff berth, but the Fusion have two games in hand,
including a home match Sunday against New England.
	   Tampa Bay's Dominic Kinnear forced the shootout when he tied the
game 2-2 3:56 left. Eddie Pope had given United a 2-1 lead just two
minutes earlier.
	   Alan Prampin put the Mutiny ahead in the 18th minute and United
tied the game in the 39th, when former Mutiny forward Roy Lassiter
scored his 17th goal of the season.
	   D.C. goalkeeper Mark Simpson, who underwent three knee
operations last year, made his first MLS appearance since June 7,
1997.
 &UR; Crew 3, Galaxy 0
	   In Pasadena, California, Stern John scored two goals and
goalkeeper Juergen Sommer made four saves in shutting out the MLS'
highest-scoring team as the Columbus Crew defeated the Los Angeles
Galaxy 3-0 Saturday night.
	   Brian McBride gave Columbus (13-12) the only goal it would need
by scoring in the 31st minute as the Crew clinched a playoff berth.
	   The Western Conference-leading Galaxy (20-7) was shut out for
just the third time this season. Los Angeles has scored an
MLS-record 76 goals this year.
	   John's first goal came in the 44th minute when he trapped a pass
from Andy Williams with his chest near the top of the penalty area,
turned 90 degrees and put a shot into the net with his right foot.
 &UR; Rapids 3, Clash 1
	   In San Jose, California, Ross Paule and Peter Vermes scored
goals two minutes apart to help the Colorado Rapids break a
five-game losing streak with a 3-1 win over the San Jose Clash on
Saturday night.
	   The duo set each other up for goals in the 23rd and 25th minutes
of the first half.
	   Marquis White gave the Rapids their final goal 30 seconds into
the second half on a cross by Paul Bravo.
	   The Clash's only goal came in the 74th minute, when Francisco
Uribe scored with a header.
	   Colorado proved to 12-15. San Jose dropped to 10-16.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian booster rocket blasted into space on
Sunday carrying a European communications satellite, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   The Proton-K rocket left from the Baikonur cosmodrome in
neighboring Kazakstan at 4:31 a.m. Moscow time (0031 GMT),
ITAR-Tass said, quoting the press center of the Strategic Missile
Forces.
	   It carried an Astra A2 satellite belonging to the

Recovering Suu Kyi greets 500 well-wishers, defies government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has
vowed before 500 well-wishers at her home that her party will defy
the government and convene parliament, her supporter said Sunday.
	   Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, has been
warned by the government that attempting to convene the parliament
_ elected in 1990 but never allowed to take power _ will be illegal
and result in long prison terms and a banning of the NLD.
	   Tin Oo, an NLD vice chairman, said that Suu Kyi had received
about 500 people Saturday evening at her lakeside compound, where
she has been recovering from low blood pressure, weakness and other
ailments since ending her 13-day roadside standoff a week ago.
	   ``Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has told her party members that the NLD
will convene a parliament by itself,'' Tin Oo said. ``She appealed
to NLD members to support and help realize the convening of the
parliament.'' Daw is an honorific.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, the winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, spent 13
days parked in a van on a bridge outside Yangon in protest after
the authorities prevented her for the fourth time from traveling to
the provinces to meet supporters.
	   The confrontations are one of the few political tools available
to Suu Kyi. The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma,
since 1962 and brooks little dissent.
	   The recent protest coincides with the 10th anniversary of a
nationwide uprising against military rule. It was crushed by
troops, leaving an estimated 3,000 people dead. The recent
agitation has not prompted Myanmar's frightened people to return to
the streets.
	   The ruling State Peace and Development Council rejected an Aug.
21 deadline set by the NLD to call the parliament. The party has
said it will do so unilaterally, though Suu Kyi has given no clear
date.
	   Suu Kyi, Tin Oo and NLD Chairman Aung Shwe met leaders of
Myanmar's ethnic minorities Saturday and discussed the moves to
convene parliament, which amount to a direct challenge to the
legitimacy of the military government.
	   An ethnic minority leader, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that Suu Kyi explained that the move is not illegal, as the
government has said.
	   The NLD won 392 of the 485 seats at stake in the 1990 elections,
while ethnic-based parties won more than 60. Faced with a crushing
defeat for pro-military parties, the ruling generals refused to
relinquish power.
	   They instead said that a new parliament would have to await a
new constitution. The committee they called to draft it has not met
in two years. The NLD has boycotted it since 1995, saying it was
stacked in favor of prolonged military rule.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The largest demonstration in memory
brought Cambodia's capital to a standstill Sunday when 15,000
people marched through the streets demanding the ouster of leader
Hun Sen, deepening Cambodia's political turmoil.
	   Though largely peaceful, the protest developed racial overtones
when a statue of Vietnamese soldiers _ who occupied the country
between 1979 and 1989 _ was smashed and burned after the march
concluded outside the National Assembly.
	   The march, preceded by a rally at the city's main sports
stadium, capped an unprecedented round-the-clock vigil since last
Monday by thousands of people objecting to Hun Sen's declared
victory in parliamentary elections a month ago.
	   Traffic police stood by helplessly as crowds swarmed past them
on foot, motorbikes and pedicabs, cheering, clapping and beeping
their horns. No arrests were reported.
	   ``Down with the despicable Hun Sen! Down with the Yuon dictator
regime!'' protesters shouted, using the derogatory term for
Vietnamese, ``Yuon.''
	   They marched past Hun Sen's residence in Phnom Penh, where he
seldom stays.
	   Vietnam's invasion toppled the genocidal Khmer Rouge. But many
Cambodians regard their neighbors with suspicion and hate. Hun Sen
came to power during the harsh occupation and many consider him too
pro-Hanoi.
	   The march ended at a park, dubbed ``Democracy Square,'' outside
the National Assembly where a small city of makeshift tents has
housed thousands of people for a week calling for Hun Sen to step
down and demanding alleged election irregularities be investigated.
	   A graffiti-scarred Vietnamese occupation-era statue in the
center of the park was attacked by a dozen demonstrators, who
smashed it with hammers, poured fuel on it and set it afire.
	   It was not destroyed, so protesters stacked tires and wood
around the statue to torch it again.
	   They were stopped by opposition leader Sam Rainsy, who
intercepted a collection taken to buy more gasoline and said the
money would be spent instead on food.
	   Sam Rainsy urged the demonstrators to stay nonviolent.
	   ``So far, thank God, there has been no bloodshed. But this is
very risky,'' Sam Rainsy told reporters. ``I don't know all of the
protesters, some may be uncontrolled elements or infiltrators.''
	   The opposition leaders whose parties officially lost the
elections, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, frequently
played on deep anti-Vietnamese sentiments during the election
campaign.
	   Hun Sen emerged the victor from the vote, but the opposition
refused to accept the result. The campaign was marred by violence
and intimidation against their supporters, and they alleged
hundreds of voting and counting irregularities.
	   The Hun Sen-packed National Election Committee has rejected
their charges as ``baseless.'' The Hun Sen-controlled
Constitutional Council, the country's highest appeals body, is to
issue a final ruling by Wednesday.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority of 64
of the 122 National Assembly seats, not enough for the two-thirds
majority needed to endorse a new government.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party threaten to
boycott the assembly and have refused offers to join a coalition,
meaning Cambodia could have no legal government when the assembly
meets for the first time Sept. 24.
	   Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-premier last year in a bloody
coup. The prince won U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993, but Hun Sen
muscled his way into a tense coalition by threatening renewed civil
war.
	   The recent elections were intended by Hun Sen to cement his
power and win back international aid and legitimacy. Instead, the
result has been to deepen hostility to his continued rule.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Aboriginal rugby league star Anthony
Mundine claimed he was racially insulted, and a referee was spat on
by angry fans, in a controversial opening round of Australia's
National Rugby League playoffs.
	   Canterbury scored a 20-12 win over St. George, Parramatta beat
North Sydney 25-12, Canberra knocked out Manly 17-4 and Sydney City
beat Melbourne 26-12. Top two sides Brisbane and Newcastle had the
week off.
	   St. George fly-half Mundine said he would lodge a protest after
he was allegedly racially abused by a rival player, while referee
Steve Clark needed a police escort away from the ground.
	   ``When I got to the dressingroom I looked in the mirror and saw
my hair was covered in spit,'' said Clark. ``Spitting is the lowest
act.''
	   Clark was also pelted with garbage after several close calls
went Canterbury's way in its fight back from 12-0 down.
	   Melbourne, hosting a final after finishing third in its debut
season, led Sydney City 12-8 at the break but were overrun in the
second term.
	   Australian test star Brad Fittler scored a first half try for
the visitors and was in strong form while Jack Elsegood rounded off
a brilliant second half passing movement to help the Roosters to an
eight point margin.
	   Parramatta gained the advantage of another chance after also
coming back from 12-0 down against Norths.
	   Jason Smith scored a try on 68 minutes to break a 12-12 deadlock
and Norths were left with a huge injury toll ahead of next week's
knockout final against Canterbury.
	   ``Most of the guys in the shed are wounded,'' said Norths coach
Peter Louis. Jason Taylor, David Fairleigh, Mark Soden, Steve
Trindall and Matt Seers are all in serious doubt for next week's
game.
	   Manly's hopes of adding to their three-straight appearances in
the championship game ended at the first hurdle on Friday.
Canberra's Ricky Stuart, playing his last games with the Raiders
before joining Canterbury, played a significant role in ending the
career of Sea Eagles veteran Cliff Lyons.
	   Stuart had a hand in all three Canberra tries and kicked a drop
goal, but it was his defensive work to nullify Lyons that kept the
Raiders alive in the 10-team finals series.
	   Next week's elimination matches are Norths vs. Canterbury and
Canberra vs. Melbourne, while Brisbane plays Parramatta and
Newcastle plays Sydney City in games where the winners advance and
the losers get another chance.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government and parliamentary
leaders are preparing for a new round of talks over a political
deal to end the country's crisis and restore calm to the markets
and confidence to the people.
	   But acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin declared Saturday
there will be no return to the Soviet system.
	   ``We have already joined the world economy, and there will be no
return to the past,'' Chernomyrdin pledged on national television.
	   His assurances followed days of frenzied negotiations in which
the government appeared ready to take drastic actions to restore
economic calm, including reimposing Soviet-style controls on prices
and the exchange rate.
	   Chernomyrdin spent hours bargaining with lawmakers Saturday over
terms of a political deal that would give the parliament more power
in return for swift confirmation of his nomination. They were
scheduled to resume meeting at 11:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) on Sunday.
	   A major sticking point was whether the lower house, the State
Duma, would be granted the power to approve or reject Cabinet
appointments. Currently they only confirm the president's
nomination of a prime minister, not lower-ranking Kremlin
officials.
	   Chernomyrdin said the deliberations were difficult in part
because they are historic.
	   ``This is the first time in six years that we are coming to
agreement on the definition of the problems in which Russia finds
herself,'' he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov told Interfax that all sides
expect to reach final agreement Sunday before parliament takes up
debate on Chernomyrdin's appointment on Monday.
	   The economy meanwhile, showed a few signs of nascent recovery.
After sharp drops earlier in the week, the ruble bounced back a bit
in Moscow street sales on Saturday and demand was high enough that
some exchange booths ran out of the Russian currency.
	   In a scripted TV interview with journalists, Chernomyrdin _
whose devotion to economic reform has frequently been questioned _
pledged to keep the ruble convertible, shore up the wobbly banking
system and protect depositors.
	   ``The main thing is to make sure people don't suffer,'' he said,
looking straight at the camera. ``For this we should use our power,
and we will use it as much as necessary.''
	   ``You can be calm. You will get your savings,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back as prime minister a week ago
because he hoped the familiar figure would restore confidence in
the government, badly damaged by the ruble's sharp decline. The
crisis of confidence climaxed Thursday in a wave of rumors that
even Yeltsin would resign.
	   But the president, with typical bluster, sought to squash such
speculation by going on television Friday to declare he would not
step down.
	   The crisis has been building all summer as Russia's financial
markets collapsed, unbuoyed even by a dlrs 23 billion international
bailout. The economic turmoil forced the government to devalue the
ruble two weeks ago, which triggered a larger crisis of confidence
in Yeltsin's government.

North leads table into playoffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ North Melbourne has confirmed its
premiership favoritism by beating second-placed Western Bulldogs to
take top spot after the last round of the Australian Football
League regular season.
	   North's record ninth win in a row came after it was behind for
three quarters. With captain Wayne Carey in brilliant form, North
battled back for 17.11 (113) to 16.12 (108) win.
	   Coach Denis Pagan was impressed with the record breaking
performance. ``We're proud of that and so are our players,'' Pagan
said.
	   The Bulldogs finished second while Sydney was third and
Melbourne fourth with the top four teams enjoying home advantage in
the first round of the eight-team playoffs.
	   Sydney ensured third place with an 18.11 (119) to 16.11 (107)
victory against Collingwood while Melbourne thrashed Richmond 19.19
(133) to 8.9 (57).
	   Richmond's loss ruled it out of the playoffs, letting Essendon
scrape in after a nervous wait.
	   Essendon was expected to secure its place against Geelong on
Saturday, but blew a 27-point lead to lose 19.13 (127) to 18.9
(117) against a team whose executive board quit en masse before the
match.
	   Defending champion Adelaide finished fifth with a last-round
15.16 (106) to 12.9 (81) win against West Coast at Subiaco. It was
Adelaide's first win against West Coast in Perth and the Eagles
needed a late surge to maintain their place in the top eight on
percentages.
	   St. Kilda was sixth following a one-point loss at last-placed
Brisbane. The Saints thought they had won the match when captain
Stewart Loewe scrambled through a late goal but the umpires ruled
the kick came after the full-time siren. The ruling meant St. Kilda
slipped from a certain top four finish and missed a home final.
	   Hawthorn's veteran forward Jason Dunstall, the third most
productive goalscorer in AFL history, ended his career on a winning
note in a match which had no bearing on the playoffs.
	   Dunstall, 34, bowed out with two goals in an 89-point win over
Fremantle. He finished with 1,254 goals in 269 matches to place
behind former Collingwood player Gordon Coventry and current Sydney
forward Tony Lockett.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Irish President Mary McAleese spent a rainy
Sunday afternoon lunching with her Singapore counterpart at an
opulent British colonial mansion used for government state
functions.
	   ``I'm very happy to be here,'' said McAleese, wearing a tropical
white pantsuit, as she introduced her husband, Martin, to President
Ong Teng Cheong.
	   Uniformed guards with bayonet rifles stood at attention on the
columned porch of the Istana mansion, which was built in 1869 for
the British governor and set in a park reminiscent of English
country house gardens.
	   The lunch, and a later cocktail reception with Irish residents
of Singapore, were the only public functions on McAleese's schedule
during her two-day rest stop before heading to Australia on Monday
for a state visit.
	   She was accompanied by Ireland's minister for the environment
and local government, Noel Dempsey, who met during the lunch with
Singapore's health and environment minister, Yeo Cheow Tong.

Thai government will try to stay in power until 2000: Report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A top member of Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai's government has said that the current coalition will try
to hang on to power until the year 2000, dampening expectations of
early elections, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Chuan meanwhile said that he was not afraid to shake up the
government, which rules with a narrow 207 to 185 majority in the
House of Representatives, if coalition members are found to be
involved in a medical equipment purchasing scandal.
	   ``I will not worry about coalition support,'' The Bangkok Post
quoted Chuan as saying Saturday. ``I will uphold what is right,
since the government is not here to stay for just one day.''
	   The longevity of Chuan's government has been in question ever
since he came to power in a crisis atmosphere last November to try
turning around the economic meltdown bequeathed by his predecessor,
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.
	   The Bangkok Post cited Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart, a
senior official in Chuan's Democrat Party, as saying at a party
rally Saturday in northern Thailand that the Democrats expect the
current government to stay in power until the year 2000.
	   By then, Sanan said, economic reforms the government has
undertaken should have accomplished a turnaround and the party
would be popular enough to win power on its own.
	   Though Thailand shows no signs of recovery yet, Chuan has stayed
in the good graces of the International Monetary Fund, which has
arranged a dlrs 17.2 billion economic rescue, and implemented some
reforms to help stabilize the economy.
	   The coalition has proven more durable than previous Thai
governments and remains fairly popular, partly because Chavalit's
opposition is still blamed by most Thais for the economic collapse
that triggered the Asian crisis.
	   A land scandal brought down Chuan's previous government in 1995,
however, and the prime minister has issued a warning that no one
will be spared in a new scandal over alleged kickbacks in purchases
of medical equipment by state hospitals.
	   Public Health Minister Rakkiat Sukthana has denied any
involvement in the scandal, revealed by rural doctors who said they
were pressured to buy over-priced medical equipment on the orders
of their superiors, who invoked Rakkiat's name.
	   An investigation has been opened into the scandal.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ A teacher at a primary school in southwestern
China was sentenced to death for raping 10 girls ages 8 to 14, a
Beijing newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The Suining Intermediate People's Court on Friday sentenced Tang
Jin to death for the rapes and indecent behavior to two other

Israeli singer's concert Nablus city cancelled due to threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A popular Israeli singer said Sunday she has
cancelled a performance in a Palestinian city after reports that
she might be attacked by Islamic militants.
	   Zehava Ben told Israel radio she was to have performed in the
West Bank city of Nablus this coming Thursday, but Israeli police
warned her that the Islamic Hamas group had expressed opposition to
her appearance there.
	   Ben's agent Eli Banai told The Associated Press a leaflet was
distributed in the mosques in Nablus warning that if Ben tried to
enter the city the Palestinians would stop her.
	   Police also received warnings that Hamas might attack Ben or try
to kidnap her if she went ahead with the performance, Israel radio
and Army radio reported.
	   Hamas is opposed to the Oslo agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians, and has killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombings
since the peace process began.
	   Ben is a supporter of reconciliation between the two peoples and
has appeared before in Palestinian cities. ``The most enthusiastic
audiences have been in Nablus,'' she told Israel radio. She sings
in Arabic but said the Palestinians also ask for her Hebrew songs.
	   A concert she was to have given in Gaza some years ago was also
canceled because security officials were apprehensive about her
safety.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The largest demonstration in memory
brought Cambodia's capital to a standstill Sunday when 15,000
people marched through the streets demanding the ouster of leader
Hun Sen, deepening Cambodia's political turmoil.
	   Though largely peaceful, the protest threatened to turn violent
when a statue of Vietnamese soldiers _ who occupied the country
from 1979 to 1989 _ was smashed and burned after the march
concluded outside the National Assembly.
	   The march, preceded by a rally at the city's main sports
stadium, capped an unprecedented round-the-clock vigil since last
Monday by thousands of people objecting to Hun Sen's declared
victory in parliamentary elections a month ago.
	   For the first time, opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy spelled out conditions Sunday for ending the
protest:
	   _ Changing the formula used in allocating seats so Hun Sen,
whose party won 41 percent of the popular vote, does not get the
parliamentary majority he currently claims.
	   _ Accounting for all unused ballots to ensure some were not used
for fraud, conducting random recounts of opposition-specified
districts, and organizing revoting in some areas.
	   ``If these demands are met, then we believe the people will end
their protest and we will encourage them to do it,'' the opposition
said in a statement. ``If they are not met, then this cannot be a
legal election.''
	   But for many ordinary people, the issue is more simple _ driving
Hun Sen from power. Traffic police stood by helplessly as crowds
swarmed past on foot, motorbikes and pedicabs, cheering, clapping
and beeping their horns.
	   ``Down with the despicable Hun Sen! Down with the Yuon dictator
regime!'' protesters shouted as they march passed Hun Sen's
residence in Phnom Penh, where he seldom stays.
	   Yuon is a derogatory term for Vietnamese. Though Vietnam's
invasion toppled the genocidal Khmer Rouge, many Cambodians regard
their neighbors with suspicion and hate. Hun Sen came to power
during the harsh occupation and many consider him too pro-Hanoi.
	   The march ended at a park, dubbed ``Democracy Square,'' outside
the National Assembly where a small city of makeshift tents has
housed thousands of protesters for a week.
	   A graffiti-scarred Vietnamese occupation-era statue in the
center of the park was attacked by a dozen demonstrators, who
smashed it with hammers, poured fuel on it and set it afire.
	   It was only slightly damaged, so protesters stacked tires and
wood around the statue to torch it again.
	   They were stopped by Sam Rainsy, who intercepted a collection
taken to buy more gasoline and said the money would be spent on
food. Sam Rainsy urged the demonstrators to stay nonviolent.
	   ``So far, thank God, there has been no bloodshed. But this is
very risky,'' Sam Rainsy told reporters. ``I don't know all of the
protesters, some may be uncontrolled elements or infiltrators.''
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy frequently played on deep
anti-Vietnamese sentiments during the election campaign.
	   They have refused to accept Hun Sen's official victory. The
campaign was marred by violence and intimidation against their
supporters, and they alleged hundreds of voting and counting
irregularities.
	   The Hun Sen-packed National Election Committee has rejected
their charges. The Hun Sen-controlled Constitutional Council, the
country's highest appeals body, is to issue a final ruling by
Wednesday.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority of 64
of the 122 National Assembly seats, not enough for the two-thirds
needed to endorse a new government.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party threaten to
boycott the assembly and have refused offers to join a coalition,
meaning Cambodia could have no legal government when the assembly
meets for the first time Sept. 24.
	   Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister last year in a
bloody coup. The prince won U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993, but
Hun Sen muscled his way into a tense coalition by threatening civil
war.

Philippine president to launch neighborhood anti-crime units.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said Sunday
he would launch a program next month aimed at organizing
neighborhood anti-crime units to speed up the government's response
to crimes and emergencies.
	   Estrada has made his anti-crime campaign a cornerstone of his
administration and he says it will help woo investors into the
country.
	   Estrada said the program, called ``Street Watch,'' would
organize residents in villages nationwide into groups that would
monitor criminal activities in their neighborhoods and report them
to authorities.
	   The groups would also report criminal threats to residents and
give advice on how they could be thwarted.
	   Estrada said a private anti-crime foundation would establish a
telephone hotline to receive calls from the groups and help relay
information to authorities.
	   Estrada also recently formed an anti-crime task force composed
of police and military men to focus on groups engaged in gun
running, kidnapping, robbery, car theft, smuggling, piracy, drug
trafficking, large-scale swindling, counterfeiting and bank fraud.
	   Filipino businessmen have consistently ranked law and order as
their top concern in the Philippines in surveys.
	   Ransom kidnappings, which often victimize wealthy
Chinese-Filipinos, and bank robberies have over the years
undermined business confidence in the Philippines.
	   Estrada, who took office June 30, also heads the Department of
Interior and Local Governments, which supervises the police force
and has a direct hand in the fight against crime.

Blair discusses Russian crisis with leaders of major powers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITS to fix 1st graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair is calling leaders of
the major industrialized powers to share assessments of Russia's
economic crisis and political changes.
	   Blair, who holds the rotating chairmanship of the Group of Eight
major industrialized nations, spoke to U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday night and to French President Jacques Chirac and
Italy's Prime Minister Romano Prodi on Saturday.
	   He hopes to complete the round of telephone conversations on
Sunday, a spokesman said, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   Details of the conversations were not released, but there
appeared to be general agreement among the leaders that the only
way to resolve the crisis is for Russia to continue economic
reforms.
	   ``The idea of the calls essentially is to take stock and share
analysis of what's going on in Russia,'' Blair's spokesman said.
``The calls are just to ensure we all understand what's happening
and share the same analysis.''
	   He said there are no plans for an emergency summit of the group.
	   Russia, whose economic crisis has been building all summer, is
the newest member of the Group of Eight. The growing global turmoil
in developing markets hit Russia, leading to the collapse of its
financial markets and forcing the government to devalue the ruble
two weeks ago. This triggered a larger crisis of confidence in
President Boris Yeltsin's government.
	   Blair has been making the calls from Balmoral Castle in Scotland
where he and his wife, Cherie, are guests of Queen Elizabeth II.
The prime minister traditionally spends a weekend at Balmoral when
the queen is vacationing with her family.
	   Blair said he plans to speak to Canada's Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi and Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima, whose country
holds the rotating presidency of the European Union.
	   Blair also discussed the Russian crisis with Bank of England
Governor Eddie George and International Monetary Fund Managing
Director Michel Camdessus, his spokesman said.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's chief economic planner on Sunday proposed
an emergency summit of major industrialized countries to address
the chaos roiling world financial markets, a news report said.
	   Economic Planning Agency Director General Taichi Sakaiya said on
a TV talk show that a gathering of the Group of Seven countries may
become necessary after Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi meets with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Septemeber, Kyodo News reported.
	   Stock markets around the world plunged last week amid political
and economic turmoil in Russia, where the ruble has gone into
freefall against the U.S. dollar and President Boris Yeltsin is
under pressure to resign.
	   Japan, which is in the midst of a stubborn recession, saw its
main stock index plummet Friday to its lowest level in more than
twelve years.

Sakagami wins Goyo Construction Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOMOZAKI, Japan (AP) _ Harumi Sakagami sank a 4-foot (1.2-meter)
par putt on the fourth playoff hole Sunday and won the Goyo
Construction Ladies, her first triumph in two years as a pro.
	   Sakagami and Kaori Higo shot 5-under-par 67s to finish the
regulation 54 holes tied at 7-under 209 along with veteran Atsuko
Hikage, who carded a 68.
	   On the second extra hole at the par-4 18th, Sakagami and Hikage
both scored birdies, while Higo two-putted for par and was
eliminated.
	   On the fourth trek of the 18th, Hikage missed a par putt that
was shorter than 3 feet (1 meter).
	   Hikage was in contention for her first victory in five years and
19th overall.
	   Higo was seeking her first title of the year and sixth overall.
	   The 60 million yen (dlrs 419,000) event paid Sakagami 10.8
million yen (dlrs 75,000).
	   ``I am more than happy,'' said the 24-year-old Sakagami. ``After
being able to put together the final round, I felt a growing
pressure in the playoff.''
	   ``I could hardly move my hands at one point,'' Sakagami added,
apparently referring to a 3-foot (1-meter) birdie putt that she
missed on the third extra hole.
	   Fusako Nagata and Aiko Hashimoto each shot a level round of 72
and fished tied for fourth at 210 together with Fuki Kido, who shot
a 71.
	   Mayumi Murai and Chie Yoshida carded 73s and shared seventh at
211.

Russia's nuclear technology makes America nervous
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ If the White House thought imposing sanctions on
Russian technology firms would scare them away from deals with
Iran, Gennady Khromov wants to set the record straight: No way.
	   ``The sanctions mean nothing to us,'' he said.
	   Khromov is the export controls expert at Glavkosmos, one of
seven Russian companies and institutes sanctioned last month by the
Clinton administration. Effective immediately, they will no longer
be able to do business with U.S. firms.
	   The only problem is _ they didn't do business with America in
the first place.
	   ``The sanctions are groundless and pointless,'' Khromov says.
	   The White House action, and Khromov's reaction, illustrate one
of the deep divides in U.S.-Russian relations.
	   When it comes to arms control, the United States tends to focus
on the safety of nuclear weapons, especially the spread of weapons
and know-how from Russia to ``rogue'' states like Iran and Libya.
	   The Russians, however, tend to focus on more traditional arms
control issues, including conventional weapons and strategic arms
control.
	   ``They basically have the same priorities, but the accent is on
different things,'' says Alexander Pikayev, a military analyst at
the Moscow branch of the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, a U.S. think tank.
	   This means that when presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton
sit down to talk about arms control during their summit Sept. 1-3,
there may be some friction.
	   The Russians see the greatest threat to their security coming
from NATO's overwhelming superiority in conventional weapons, and
would like to even out the balance. They also want to negotiate
deeper cuts in nuclear missiles in a new START III treaty.
	   However, asking Clinton to reduce NATO's war-fighting capability
would be a non-starter. As for START III, the main obstacle is the
Russian parliament. Angry over Russia's declining superpower
status, lawmakers have refused to ratify the previous treaty, START
II, despite pleas and prods from Yeltsin.
	   With START III on hold, nuclear non-proliferation is likely to
take top priority on the American side. In particular, Clinton is
expected to press U.S. demands for tougher action to keep missile
technology and nuclear materials out of Iranian hands.
	   The U.S. emphasis on Iran is irritating to more than a few
Russians, who consider the country a neighbor and long-time ally.
	   ``Your relations with Iran are your affair,'' Khromov says.
``For our part, we are categorically against condemning all forms
of cooperation with Iran.''
	   One reason is that nuclear technology is one of Russia's few
exports, and the government is desperate to earn cash. The Russians
are helping Iran build a nuclear power plant at Bushehr and the
deal is said to be worth about dlrs 800 million. The United States
fears the plant could help Iran develop its potential to make
nuclear weapons, a concern the Russians say is groundless.
	   The Glavkosmos case is different. The company is a state-owned
firm that negotiates sales of Russian space technology _ everything
from solar batteries to rockets. The United States, based on
reports from the Russian government, suspects Glavkosmos of
arranging deals to sell missile technology to Iran.
	   Concerns about such sales deepened recently when Iran
successfully tested a new missile capable of carrying a nuclear
warhead as far as Israel. While analysts agree that the technology
was supplied by North Korea, the incident heightened fears that
Iran would increasingly seek such technology from Russia.
	   Russia has tight export controls on the books, and Glavkosmos
says its contracts with Iran have all been reviewed and approved by
the Russian government.
	   While he won't give details, Khromov insists ``You can't use the
word `missile' in connection with any of our contracts with Iran.''
	   But even simple items can be turned to military uses, and it can
often be extremely difficult to determine if a given purchase is
purely civilian in intent.
	   Khromov gives an example. Glavkosmos sold desalinization
equipment to Iran, presumably to help them produce drinking water
in desert communities.
	   ``Is it possible that soldiers at a missile site could drink
this water? It's possible,'' Khromov says. ``Is that a violation?
Often you can't find hard boundaries between what's permitted and
what's forbidden.''
	   Analysts say the U.S. sanctions are unlikely to have much effect
on Russia although they may be a deterrent to the many European
companies eager to make deals with the Iranians.
	   ``It won't stop the trade and I don't think the administration
thought for a moment that it would,'' said Terry Taylor of the
International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. ``But it
does send a warning to companies in Britain, Germany, France and
elsewhere.''
	   In the meantime, the United States intends to keep up the
pressure on the Russians.
	   After all, Taylor asks, ``What's the alternative?''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government and parliamentary
leaders agreed Sunday to an 18-month truce that would leave Boris
Yeltsin in control and give the administration time to try to end
the country's economic and political crisis.
	   Under the tentative agreement, Communists and their allies
agreed to give swift confirmation to acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and said they would not try to topple the government
for 18 months.
	   In exchange, President Yeltsin will consult lawmakers on Cabinet
appointments and will not dissolve parliament during the same
period, Russian media reported.
	   The agreement comes after nearly a week of uncertainty about who
was in charge of Russia while the economy is in a tailspin. While
Yeltsin would be obliged to consult parliament on key issues, the
agreement appeared to leave him with substantial political power.
	   The agreement would provide a political truce until
parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1999. Under the
Russian Constitution, the parliament has little authority and
opposition leaders had demanded some form of power sharing, but the
pact appeared to stop short of that.
	   Yeltsin was forced to go on national television Friday to
reiterate he would not resign before his term ends in 2000 and
Chernomyrdin followed on Saturday with reassurances that there will
be no return to the Soviet system.
	   ``Maybe we would have liked some sections of the documents to be
tougher,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is speaker of
the State Duma.
	   ``But we must take into consideration that there are seven
factions in the State Duma, there is the president, the government
and the Federation Council,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   The Federation Council is the upper chamber of parliament and
the State Duma, the lower. The Duma is scheduled to meet Monday to
consider Chernomyrdin's appointment, and Alexander Shokhin, the
head of his parliamentary faction predicted he would be approved on
the first vote.
	   Chernomyrdin said Saturday the negotiations on the political
agreement were difficult in part because they are historic.
	   ``This is the first time in six years that we are coming to
agreement on the definition of the problems in which Russia finds
herself,'' he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The agreement was sent to Yeltsin to sign at his country
residence outside of Moscow, said Vladimir Ryzhkov, deputy speaker
of the Duma.
	   It could yet be derailed by some of the smaller parties who were
still seeking amendments.
	   The Communists want some changes made to the terms of IMF loans
to Russia, said the chairman of their allied Agrarian Party,
Nikolai Kharitonov. They also want Yeltsin to be forced to consult
them on an alternative candidate for prime minister if they reject
Chernomyrdin. Yeltsin now has the authority to dissolve parliament
if they reject his candidate three times.
	   Chernomyrdin _ whose ability to carry out economic reforms has
been questioned in the past _ vowed in a scripted TV interview
Saturday that there will be no return to the Soviet system.
	   ``We have already joined the world economy, and there will be no
return to the past,'' Chernomyrdin said, promising to keep the
ruble convertible, shore up the wobbly banking system and protect
depositors.
	   ``The main thing is to make sure people don't suffer,'' he said,
looking straight at the camera. ``For this we should use our power,
and we will use it as much as necessary.''
	   ``You can be calm. You will get your savings,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back as prime minister a week ago
because he hoped the familiar figure would restore confidence in
the government, badly damaged by the ruble's sharp decline.
	   The situation showed a few signs of nascent recovery. After
sharp drops last week, the ruble bounced back a bit in Moscow
street sales and demand was high enough that some exchange booths
ran out of the Russian currency.
	   The crisis has been building all summer as Russia's financial
markets collapsed, hit by the growing global crisis in developing
markets. The economic turmoil forced the government to devalue the
ruble two weeks ago, which triggered a larger crisis of confidence
in Yeltsin's government.

Cuban president named winner of Gadhafi human rights award
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya has named Cuban President Fidel Castro
the winner of its 1998 human rights award, which is named in honor
of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported Sunday.
	   It said the award was ``in appreciation of his history of
struggle,'' the agency said.
	   Previous winners of the award include South African President
Nelson Mandela and Louis Farrakhan, the controversial leader of the
Nation of Islam.
	   The prize generally is awarded during celebrations marking the
anniversary of the coup that brought Gadhafi to power in September
1969.
	   There was no word on whether Castro would attend the ceremonies.
	   The award _ which carries a cash prize of dlrs 250,000 _ has
been given annually since 1989.
	   Libya and Cuba have good relations. Both are on the U.S. State
Department list of countries that allegedly sponsor terrorism.
	   MENA said that other contenders for this year's prize were Pope
Shenouda III, who is head of the Coptic Christian church in Egypt,
and former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark. The agency did not
say why they were nominated.

Superlative-happy Malaysia attempts world's longest car convoy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GELUGOR, Malaysia _ In yet another attempt to set a world
record, Malaysia's prime minister Sunday led a fleet of 1,998
national cars and touted it as the world's longest car convoy.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad waved to thousands of cheering
onlookers from the wheel of a Proton Wira sedan, followed by
cabinet ministers, cab drivers and volunteers over a 10 kilometer
(6 mile) route.
	   While Malaysia continues to grapple with a full-blown recession,
the Southeast Asian nation remains enamored of record-breaking
feats.
	   A number of these attempts have been set here in the northern
state of Penang, the venue for Malaysia's 41st-year independence
celebration scheduled to take place Monday.
	   The blue Proton Wira that Mahathir drove, for example, is
purportedly the only Asian car to be parachuted onto the north
pole, while the 13.5-kilometer (8.35-mile) bridge the convoy
crossed has been called Asia's longest.
	   Despite rain and overcast skies, nearly 2,500 volunteers turned
up for the record-breaking event.
	   ``Malaysia Can!'' shouted a family of five holding colorful
umbrellas and waving the Malaysian flag as the convoy passed by.
	   As Malaysia celebrates 41 years of independence from British
rule, its economy is in the throes a deep recession _ a far cry
from the galloping 8 percent growth the country had enjoyed over
the past decade.
	   But that hasn't prevented the 72-year-old Mahathir _ the world's
longest ruling elected head of a democratic government _ from
striving for superlative accomplishments.
	   This year, Mahathir has inaugurated the 88-story Petronas
towers, touted as the world's tallest building and the Kuala Lumpur
International Airport, Southeast Asia's biggest airport, which also
contains the world's largest hangar and loftiest control tower.
	   Inspired by the prime minister's penchant for records,
Malaysians have organized the most massive beach party, the largest
outdoor buffet, and biggest pop-up greeting card for entry in the
``Guiness Book of World Records.''
	   Attempts that fall short of Guiness' standards are still
eligible for Malaysia's own ``Book of Records.''

Planes forced to avoid vehicle on runway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Two planes were forced to make last-minute
maneuvers to avoid hitting a fire services vehicle that drove
across the runway of Hong Kong's new airport, the government said
Sunday.
	   The Civil Aviation Department said a Cathay Pacific Airways
aircraft preparing to take off last Tuesday had to stop when it
spotted the vehicle. Airport traffic controllers also had to
command an in-bound Chinese Eastern jet to abort its landing, it
said.
	   The department is investigating why the vehicle appeared on the
runway.
	   The U.S. dlrs 20.1 billion Chek Lap Kok airport has been hit by
a series of computer and mechanical glitches since it opened in
July. The airport only began handling air cargo at full capacity
last week.

Sudan: relief plane may have spied prior to U.S. strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudan suggested Sunday that a relief plane
from a U.N. umbrella group may have spied on behalf of the United
States, carrying out surveillance just before the American missile
strike on a Sudanese factory.
	   The Sudanese foreign minister, Mustafa Osman Ismail, told
reporters in the Kenyan capital that Sudanese suspicions were
aroused by the fact that a plane from Operation Lifeline Sudan had
been cleared to land just prior to the Aug. 20 U.S. raid, but
instead circled the airport and then flew off.
	   Its flight path took it very close to the targeted factory, he
added.
	   Ismail said Sudan had no direct proof the plane was conducting
surveillance on behalf of the United States, but said: ``This is
our analysis.''
	   Representatives of the Kenya-based relief organization could not
immediately be reached for comment. The group has been funneling
aid to Sudanese in the country's south who face starvation due to
drought and the 15-year civil war between the Islamic government
and rebels.
	   Ssudan has long been Operation Lifeline Sudan, accusing it at
repeatedly in the past of aiding the southern rebels.
	   Ismail was in Kenya for a stopover en route to Durban, South
Africa for the Non-aligned Movement meeting. At the gathering,
Sudan's President Omar el-Bashir plans to make an issue of the U.S.
strike, which came 13 days after the twin bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 258 people.
	   The Clinton administration said the targeted sites had links to
Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, whom it accuses of inspiring and
bankrolling the embassy attacks.
	   Washington has said the Sudanese plant was manufacturing
precursors for VX nerve gas, but Sudan says it was strictly a
pharmaceutical manufacturer _ a claim Ismail reiterated on Sunday.
	   Sudan, he said, ``has got nothing to do with bin Laden, it has
nothing to do with chemicals.''
	   The foreign minister also renewed Sudan's calls for an
independent fact-finding mission by the United Nations Security
Council or another foreign observer group to study competing U.S.
and Sudanese claims about the El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries
Co.'s activities.
	   He also said that even if the plant had been a chemical-weapons
factory, the U.S. strike against it would have been ``genocide''
because the plant, on Khartoum's outskirts, was in a populated area
and close to a river that could have been contaminated.
	   Despite the harsh criticism of the U.S. strike, Ismail said
Sudan's main interest was to determine whether the United States
had simply been ``misled or misinformed'' in hitting the Khartoum
factory.
	   ``We are not confronting the U.S.,'' he said. ``We are for
mutual dialogue and understanding.''
	   Ismail also said he had no opinion of Kenya's handing over last
week of two suspects in the embassy bombing to the United States
for trial.
	   ``That's up to the Kenyans, of course,'' he said.
	   Kenyans generally greeted the handover with relief, because of
fears a terrorist trial could bring new attacks against their
country. But some saw the move as giving up too much national
sovereignty.

China's destructive floods have environmental silver lining
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BEJ103, Graphic CHINA FLOODS &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARBIN, China (AP) _ Their homes drowned by muddy, fetid
floodwaters, refugees huddle with their pigs, cows and dogs under
cramped lean-tos on high ground.
	   Furniture, wet clothes and whatever other belongings people
managed to salvage are piled nearby. In the filthy, hot and humid
conditions, diarrhea, skin diseases and stress thrive. Drinking
water is short, discomfort plentiful.
	   Such is the misery wrought by floods that have ravaged China for
more than two months, inundating towns and villages, washing away
roads, railways and bridges. The human toll: at least 3,000 dead,
millions more homeless. By government count, 223 million people _
nearly the population of the United States _ have been affected.
	   But in the upended lives and wrecked communities, there may be
some good for China's embattled environment.
	   Facing mounting criticism from outcast dissidents as well as
senior legislators, officials have acknowledged an unpalatable
truth: Misuse of land and other human mistakes _ not just
persistent, torrential rains _ played a role in the floods'
ferocity.
	   Criticism focused on unrestrained logging that increased water
runoff and the destruction of vital lakes that could have absorbed
increased flow along the Yangtze, the world's third longest river
that has seen its worst flooding in 44 years. Critics also said
flood controls were neglected.
	   The response: a new government ban on logging on the Yangtze's
upper reaches, plans to reverse the damaging human invasion of its
lakes and calls for more investment in flood control.
	   ``We have asked a lot of nature. Now we are going to give back
to nature,'' Zhao Qizheng, the top government spokesman, told
reporters last week.
	   The summer rainy season brings floods to China every year. But
this year's storms were earlier, heavier and more widespread than
normal _ in part due to El Nino, the global weather phenomenon.
	   Deadly flooding hit the usually arid northwest. Mudslides and
flash floods engulfed villages. In Wuhan, an industrial city of 7
million, people waded through waist-deep water; ducks paddled down
flooded streets.
	   The rains caused rivers _ including the 3,900-mile Yangtze _ to
rise, first to warning levels, then to record levels, and then
beyond.
	   In Hubei and Hunan, badly hit provinces crisscrossed by the
Yangtze and its tributaries, floodwaters only had to rise a few
feet in some areas to overwhelm dikes and inundate the countryside.
	   The flatness of the surrounding farmland allowed floodwaters to
spread in some places for miles, forming placid lakes broken only
by dikes and the raised beds of train tracks.
	   The government already has the mammoth Three Gorges Dam, the
world's largest hydro project, under construction in the middle
reaches of the Yangtze in Hubei, and officials say one of its main
purposes is to prevent such flooding.
	   Critics, however, say the dam will not be big enough to hold
back the Yangtze and its tributaries at flood times. They also
question whether dam operators will discharge water to prevent
flooding upriver instead of keeping reservoir levels high for
generating electricity.
	   In the northeast, a region bordering Russia where winters are
bitterly cold, 1 million people are homeless. Already, evacuees in
makeshift lean-tos are shivering through nights as temperatures
drop to around 50 degrees.
	   Because flood fighting efforts focused on saving cities, farmers
have often been among the worst affected. Some rural areas were
inundated deliberately to relieve pressure on levees safeguarding
urban areas.
	   ``It's disastrous. We couldn't get our possessions out,'' said
Shi Baohuai, whose village near the northeastern industrial center
of Harbin was flooded by the bloated Songhua River. ``We can't
start over again; we haven't got any money.''
	   Short-term, government leaders hope rebuilding after floodwaters
recede will boost the flagging economy, pushing them closer to
their goal of 8 percent economic growth this year.
	   But long-term, the flooding's environmental message may be the
most far-reaching, belatedly concentrating government leaders'
minds on the destruction of nature that has accompanied China's
rush for development.
	   ``This flooding should be a very important pivotal moment,
giving them a very big lesson,'' said Dai Qing, an author and
persistent critic of government policies.
	   The new logging ban taking effect on the Yangtze's upper reaches
on Sept. 1 will be accompanied by loggers given work planting and
protecting trees, state news media said.
	   Deforestation has denuded hills, making them unable to absorb
rain. Water rushes down, triggering mudslides and washing soil into
rivers. There, it silts up channels and raises water levels,
worsening floods.
	   Silting also has combined with human encroachment to shrink
Yangtze basin lakes, reducing their effectiveness as sponges to
soak up floods. Hubei province had 1,066 lakes in the 1950s. Now it
has 325, and three-quarters of those are shrunken.
	   ``For so many years, by blindly following the concept that `man
can conquer nature,' we have built up vast, evil debts to the
Yangtze River,'' 309 dissidents said last week in the largest

Runaway weather balloon lost in Arctic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A runaway weather balloon which proved to be
tougher than Canada's top guns is lost in the Arctic.
	   The 100-meter-high (110-yard-high) balloon disappeared off radar
screens late Saturday night about 200 miles (320 kms) north of the
Arctic Circle and was still missing Sunday morning, said Halli
Sigurdsson, deputy director of Air Traffic Services in Iceland.
	   ``The balloon is lost _ we lost it,'' he said.
	   Sigurdsson said a U.S. Navy P-3 Orion martime patrol aircraft
took off Sunday morning from the NATO military base at Keflavik on
Iceland's southwest coast to search for the errant balloon.
	   ``They are heading to the point where they lost the balloon and
they will start a search from that position,'' he told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview.
	   The balloon, an unstaffed research station used to observe
weather patterns, can be seen from about 70 kilometers (40 miles)
away. It is not equipped with transponders that emit navigation
signals to alert airliners to its presence.
	   Air traffic controllers in Iceland had been diverting planes
from the balloon's path.
	   ``This is obviously a much worse situation _ not knowing where
it is then when we knew where it was and we could route air traffic
around it,'' Sigurdsson said.
	   Aircraft from Canada, Britain and the U.S. military in Iceland
had tracked the runaway balloon. Canadian jet fighters on Thursday
fired more than 1,000 rounds into the helium-filled balloon but it
remained aloft.
	   On Saturday, when the balloon came close to Iceland, a volcanic
island nation in the North Atlantic just under the Arctic Circle,
the U.S. military picked it up on radar. The U.S. military aircraft
tracking the balloon then landed.
	   ``When the balloon went north of Iceland, the U.S. military lost
it off radar,'' he said, noting that it disappeared between 2300
and 2400 GMT on Saturday. ``At the time, they had no aircraft
flying to follow the balloon.''
	   The 25-story balloon, which flattened out would cover five
football fields, was launched before dawn on Monday from Vanscoy,
just outside Saskatoon, in Canada to measure ozone levels over
Canada.
	   The project was a joint effort between the Canadian Space
Agency, Environment Canada, the Center for Research in Earth and
Space Technology, the University of Toronto, York University and
the University of Denver.

Prince Hassan: Talk of confederation with Palestinians premature

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Crown Prince Hassan said Sunday that any
talk of a confederation between Jordan and the Palestinians is
premature.
	   But the crown prince also told a conference here that Jordan
will continue to support the Palestinians as ``the Palestinian Arab
conduit to the Arab world.''
	   Hassan, who is acting as regent while King Hussein undergoes
cancer treatment in the United States, did not spell out why Jordan
is hesitant to discuss confederation.
	   But the king has said repeatedly that Jordan preferred to hold
off discussing its future relationship with the Palestinians until
they have some form of independence.
	   Hassan told the conference: ``We in Jordan held to the position
_ and we still do _ that it is premature at this stage to discuss
the future strategic relations between Jordan and the
Palestinians.''
	   There has long been talk that an independent Palestinian state
in the West Bank would have to link up with neighboring Jordan or
Israel to be economically viable.
	   In 1988, the Palestinian National Council, a
parliament-in-exile, voted for a confederation with Jordan, which
ruled the West Bank from 1950 until Israel seized the territory in
the 1967 Middle East War.
	   In his one-hour address to 300 visiting government officials,
businessmen and political experts, Hassan also stressed that the
future of Arab relations with Israel hinged on a peace agreement
being reached between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   ``It is fair that the peace talks must succeed,'' the crown
prince said. ``Our efforts for peace building must continue. The
Palestinian track is the heart and soul of the peace process and
without it, it has no text and it has no context.''
	   Jordan signed its own peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
	   The conference Sunday was sponsored by the North Atlantic
Initiative, launched 1996 to try to improve economic and political
cooperation among North Atlantic Treaty Organization members and
supporters.
	   Participants here were to visit neighboring Israel on Monday,
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was expected to
address the gathering there.

Report: Former ruling party ally seeks cooperation with opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Social Democratic Party, a former coalition
partner of Japan's ruling party, decided Sunday to seek alliances
with opposition parties at an extraordinary convention, a news
report said.
	   The Socialists have lost much of their credibility with the
Japanese public because of their four-year partnership with the
conservative Liberal Democratic Party and suffered major losses in
July parliamentary elections.
	   At a special convention to plot out strategies to rebuild
itself, the SDP decided to cooperate with the main opposition
Democratic Party and other parties in future elections, Kyodo News
reported.
	   The LDP's popularity ratings have sunken to record lows because
of its handling of Japan's languishing economy, and many opposition
groups are calling for a broad alliance to try to boot the party
from power.
	   The SDP also voted to retain its leader Takako Doi, but
reshuffled other key posts, Kyodo said.
	   The Socialists ended their partnership with the LDP before
elections for the upper house of Parliament on July 12.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government and parliamentary
leaders agreed Sunday to an 18-month truce that would leave Boris
Yeltsin in control and give the administration time to try to end
the country's economic and political crisis.
	   Under the tentative agreement, Communists and their allies
agreed to give swift confirmation to acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and said they would not try to topple the government
for 18 months.
	   In exchange, President Yeltsin will consult lawmakers on Cabinet
appointments and will not dissolve parliament during the same
period, Russian media reported.
	   The agreement comes after nearly a week of uncertainty about who
was in charge of Russia while the economy is in a tailspin. While
Yeltsin would be obliged to consult parliament on key issues, the
agreement appeared to leave him with substantial political power.
	   The agreement would provide a political truce until
parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1999. Under the
Russian Constitution, the parliament has little authority and
opposition leaders had demanded some form of power sharing, but the
pact appeared to stop short of that.
	   Yeltsin was forced to go on national television Friday to
reiterate he would not resign before his term ends in 2000 and
Chernomyrdin followed on Saturday with reassurances that there will
be no return to the Soviet system.
	   ``Maybe we would have liked some sections of the documents to be
tougher,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is speaker of
the State Duma.
	   ``But we must take into consideration that there are seven
factions in the State Duma, there is the president, the government
and the Federation Council,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   The Federation Council is the upper chamber of parliament and
the State Duma, the lower. The Duma is scheduled to meet Monday to
consider Chernomyrdin's appointment, and Alexander Shokhin, the
head of his parliamentary faction predicted he would be approved on
the first vote.
	   Chernomyrdin said Saturday the negotiations on the political
agreement were difficult in part because they are historic.
	   ``This is the first time in six years that we are coming to
agreement on the definition of the problems in which Russia finds
herself,'' he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The agreement was sent to Yeltsin to sign at his country
residence outside of Moscow, said Vladimir Ryzhkov, deputy speaker
of the Duma.
	   It could yet be derailed by some of the smaller parties who were
still seeking amendments.
	   The Communists want some changes made to the terms of IMF loans
to Russia, said the chairman of their allied Agrarian Party,
Nikolai Kharitonov. They also want Yeltsin to be forced to consult
them on an alternative candidate for prime minister if they reject
Chernomyrdin. Yeltsin now has the authority to dissolve parliament
if they reject his candidate three times.
	   Last week the hard-liners were also seeking a package of
Soviet-style economic measures, such as price and currency
controls, renationalization, and printing more money.
	   But they have said nothing about it since Chernomyrdin vowed in
a scripted TV interview Saturday that there will be no return to
the Soviet system. There was no mention of an economic agreement
after Sunday's negotiations.
	   ``We have already joined the world economy, and there will be no
return to the past,'' Chernomyrdin said, promising to keep the
ruble convertible, shore up the wobbly banking system and protect
depositors.
	   ``The main thing is to make sure people don't suffer,'' he said,
looking straight at the camera. ``For this we should use our power,
and we will use it as much as necessary.''
	   ``You can be calm. You will get your savings,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back as prime minister a week ago
because he hoped the familiar figure would restore confidence in
the government, badly damaged by the ruble's sharp decline.
	   The Russian ruble appeared to gain in street trading Sunday and
exchange points across Moscow were buying U.S. dollars at an
average 8 rubles, down from an average 8.5 the day before. That
would value one ruble at about 12.5 cents, up from 11.76 cents.
	   The average street rate was close to the latest official rate of
7.95 rubles to the dollar _ or 12.57 cents _ set before Russia's
Central Bank suspended dollar sales last week.
	   The crisis has been building all summer as Russia's financial
markets collapsed, hit by the growing global crisis in developing
markets. The economic turmoil forced the government to devalue the
ruble two weeks ago, which triggered a larger crisis of confidence
in Yeltsin's government.

Pope offers recipe for post-vacation blues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Sunday
offered a prescription against post-vacation blues for those
everywhere heading back to work or school.
	   ``I try to imagine what passes through the spirit of one who
comes back after a period of relaxation, perhaps long desired and
now already over,'' the pope told tourists and pilgrims at his
summer residence in Castel Gandolfo, in the hills southeast of
Rome.
	   John Paul added that ``maybe a sense of disappointment''
accompanies those returning to ``daily reality, with its
concreteness, its problems, its heaviness.''
	   ``All this can also be depressing. But there's an antidote
against depression,'' the pope said. ``Keep in your heart a great
ideal, of authentic values which give sense to your own life,''
John Paul concluded.
	   The pontiff also offered advice to those braving the traffic
back home, telling motorists to use ``prudence'' behind the wheel.
	   John Paul himself appeared relaxed. When someone in the crowd
yelled out, ``There has never been such a likeable and capable
pope,'' John Paul joked back: ``For some (I'm) likeable, for
others, unpleasant, there's nothing to do about that.''
	   John Paul's own vacation continues. Except for shuttling back to
Vatican City for his Wednesday public audiences, the pope will stay
at his vacation retreat here until mid-September.

Police on hand for small gathering at Diana memorial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ As they have every day for a year, people gathered
Sunday at the Pont de l'Alma, where Princess Diana met her death in
a high-speed crash last August.
	   More police than usual were on hand to prevent people from
walking into the traffic tunnel, and perhaps causing an accident.
But the crowd, most of them tourists, seemed typical for a Sunday
afternoon in Paris.
	   More were expected for an evening vigil on Monday, the
anniversary of Diana's Aug. 31 death.
	   All year, people have been paying homage to Diana at a makeshift
memorial by the bridge. The bronze Flame of Liberty _ a replica of
the flame of the Statue of Liberty _ was originally erected to
honor French-American ties. Now, its pedestal is covered with
flowers and handwritten notes to the three victims of the crash:
Diana, her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and driver Henri Paul.
	   There will soon be an official memorial to Diana, too. Last week
the city of Paris said it would transform a former school in the
heart of the capital into a nature center named after the princess.
	   The park in the historic Marais neighborhood, to open next
spring, will be aimed at teaching children to respect nature and
learn about gardening. The public will be able to visit the garden
on the weekends.
	   Mayor Jean Tiberi also has expressed the wish to rename a street
in Paris for Diana. But that procedure takes five years to
formalize.
	   A poll earlier this month showed 70 percent of French people
want a street or square to be named after her.

people marched through the streets demanding the ouster of leader
Hun Sen, deepening Cambodia's political turmoil. The march was
largely peaceful until the end, when protesters attacked a statue
of Vietnamese soldiers _ who occupied the country from 1979 to 1989
_ outside the National Assembly. The statue was only slightly
damaged, and opposition leader Sam Rainsy urged the demonstrators
to stay nonviolent. The march, preceded by a rally at the city's
main sports stadium, capped an unprecedented round-the-clock vigil
since last Monday by thousands of people objecting to Hun Sen's
declared victory in parliamentary elections a month ago.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Angolan forces fighting on behalf of
President Laurent Kabila have captured the port town of Matadi, one
of the last rebel strongholds in southwestern Congo,
state-controlled radio reported Sunday. A ministry-level government
official confirmed the report. The official said rebel forces had
withdrawn and left the city to advancing Angolan soldiers.
State-controlled Voice of the People radio also said a key power
dam at the town of Inga had been recaptured by Congo's allies,
although electricity to Kinshasa had not yet been restored.
Jean-Pierre Ondekane, a senior rebel commander, had earlier given a
tacit warning that the Inga dam would be destroyed if Angolan
troops tried to take it. (CONGO)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's flood control headquarters sent an urgent
appeal to soldiers and civilians already worn down from a
summer-long battle against floods, urging them Sunday to keep up
the fight. Another flood crest rolled down the Yangtze River,
China's longest river. It has been hit by the heaviest flooding
since 1954, when more than 30,000 people were killed. This year's
floods have killed more than 3,000 people, 1,320 of them along the
3,900-mile- (6,200-kilometer-) long Yangtze. Flood control
officials urged the millions of people patrolling important dikes
along the river and on Dongting Lake to work hard guarding danger
points, People's Daily reported Sunday. The dikes have been
weakened and waterlogged after more than two months of floods that
have left millions of people homeless. (CHINA-FLOODS)
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi
promised 500 well-wishers at her home that her party will defy the
government and convene parliament, her supporter said Sunday. Suu
Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, has been warned by
the government that attempting to convene the parliament _ elected
in 1990 but never allowed to take power _ is illegal and will
result in long prison terms and a banning of the NLD. Suu Kyi, 53,
the winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, spent 13 days parked in a
van on a bridge outside Yangon in protest after the authorities
prevented her for the fourth time from traveling to the provinces
to meet supporters. The recent protest coincides with the 10th
anniversary of a nationwide uprising against military rule in
Myanmar, also known as Burma. It was crushed by troops, leaving an
estimated 3,000 people dead. (MYANMAR)

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A Palestinian firing squad Sunday
executed two brothers for murdering two brothers as part of a long
standing family feud.
	   Mohammed Abu Sultan, 25 and Raed Abu Sultan, 24, were sentenced
to death Saturday by a military court for gunning down Majdi
al-Khaldi, 32, and Mohammed al-Khaldi, 30, at a wedding party.
	   The sentences were confirmed Sunday by Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat.
	   A third member of the family, Faris Abu Sultan, was also
sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted Sunday to life
imprisonment.
	   Two other members of the Abu Sultan family were given life
sentences for their involvement in the shootings.
	   The members of both families involved in the attack belonged to
Palestinian security services.
	   Although Palestinian courts have issued several death sentences
before, these were the first to be carried out.

Deputy: Taliban killed Iranian diplomats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A member of the Iranian parliament was
quoted Sunday as saying he believed that the Taliban movement in
Afghanistan killed 11 Iranian diplomats after the storming of
Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Mortaza Nabavi, a prominent deputy in Iran's Majlis, or
parliament, was quoted by the Farsi-language daily Rouznameh Zan.
It marked the first time an Iranian official has said anything
about the possibility the diplomats were dead.
	   Nabavi said that reliable Shiite Muslim sources, whom he did not
name, reported that the diplomats were killed by the Taliban. He
gave no further details.
	   Iran claims that the 11 diplomats, along with 35 truck drivers
and a journalist for the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency,
were captured by the Taliban when the fundamentalist group overran
the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban has said it knows nothing about the Iranian
diplomats, but it admits to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of
arming its opponents.
	   Iran is believed to have backed the northern-based opposition to
the Taliban, while Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and
other support to the Taliban.
	   Iran has said it holds Pakistan responsible for the detainees'
safety.
	   Earlier this month, an Iranian official was allowed to meet with
the detained Iranian truck drivers in the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar.
	   Iran's deputy foreign minister, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, said the
official found the drivers to be in good health but that the
Taliban did not allow him to meet the missing diplomats or the IRNA
correspondent.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government and parliamentary
leaders agreed Sunday to an 18-month truce that would leave Boris
Yeltsin in control and give the administration time to try to end
the country's economic and political crisis.
	   Under the tentative agreement, Communists and their allies
agreed to give swift confirmation to acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and said they would not try to topple the government
for 18 months.
	   In exchange, President Yeltsin will consult lawmakers on Cabinet
appointments and will not dissolve parliament during the same
period, Russian media reported.
	   The agreement comes after nearly a week of uncertainty about who
was in charge of Russia while the economy is in a tailspin. While
Yeltsin would be obliged to consult parliament on key issues, the
agreement appeared to leave him with substantial political power.
	   The agreement would provide a political truce until
parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1999. Under the
Russian Constitution, the parliament has little authority and
opposition leaders had demanded some form of power sharing, but the
pact appeared to stop short of that.
	   Yeltsin was forced to go on national television Friday to
reiterate he would not resign before his term ends in 2000 and
Chernomyrdin followed on Saturday with reassurances that there will
be no return to the Soviet system.
	   ``Maybe we would have liked some sections of the documents to be
tougher,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is speaker of
the State Duma.
	   ``But we must take into consideration that there are seven
factions in the State Duma, there is the president, the government
and the Federation Council,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   The Federation Council is the upper chamber of parliament and
the State Duma, the lower. The Duma is scheduled to meet Monday to
consider Chernomyrdin's appointment, and Alexander Shokhin, the
head of his parliamentary faction predicted he would be approved on
the first vote.
	   Chernomyrdin said Saturday the negotiations on the political
agreement were difficult in part because they are historic.
	   ``This is the first time in six years that we are coming to
agreement on the definition of the problems in which Russia finds
herself,'' he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The agreement was sent to Yeltsin to sign at his country
residence outside of Moscow, said Vladimir Ryzhkov, deputy speaker
of the Duma.
	   Yeltsin spoke by telephone to one of his staunchest allies,
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the two men agreed that the fast
confirmation of a new Cabinet would be a significant factor in
restoring stability in Russia, the presidential press service said.
	   The agreement could yet be derailed by some of the smaller
parties who were still seeking amendments.
	   The Communists want some changes made to the terms of IMF loans
to Russia, said the chairman of their allied Agrarian Party,
Nikolai Kharitonov. They also want Yeltsin to be forced to consult
them on an alternative candidate for prime minister if they reject
Chernomyrdin. Yeltsin now has the authority to dissolve parliament
if they reject his candidate three times.
	   Last week the hard-liners were also seeking a package of
Soviet-style economic measures, such as price and currency
controls, renationalization, and printing more money.
	   But they have said nothing about it since Chernomyrdin vowed in
a scripted TV interview Saturday that there will be no return to
the Soviet system. There was no mention of an economic agreement
after Sunday's negotiations.
	   ``We have already joined the world economy, and there will be no
return to the past,'' Chernomyrdin said, promising to keep the
ruble convertible, shore up the wobbly banking system and protect
depositors.
	   ``The main thing is to make sure people don't suffer,'' he said,
looking straight at the camera. ``For this we should use our power,
and we will use it as much as necessary.''
	   ``You can be calm. You will get your savings,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back as prime minister a week ago
because he hoped the familiar figure would restore confidence in
the government, badly damaged by the ruble's sharp decline.
	   The Russian ruble appeared to gain in street trading Sunday and
exchange points across Moscow were buying U.S. dollars at an
average 8 rubles, down from an average 8.5 the day before. That
would value one ruble at about 12.5 cents, up from 11.76 cents.
	   The average street rate was close to the latest official rate of
7.95 rubles to the dollar _ or 12.57 cents _ set before Russia's
Central Bank suspended dollar sales last week.
	   The crisis has been building all summer as Russia's financial
markets collapsed, hit by the growing global crisis in developing
markets. The economic turmoil forced the government to devalue the
ruble two weeks ago, which triggered a larger crisis of confidence
in Yeltsin's government.

Gough leads an England fightback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Darren Gough led an England fightback with two
wickets in as many balls as Sri Lanka lost its way on the fourth
morning of the one-test at the Oval Sunday.
	   Resuming the day on 446 for three, Sri Lanka, struggled to 518
for seven at lunch, extending its overnight one-run lead to 73.
England scored 445 in its first innings.
	   Gough, ended Sri Lanka's hopes of a big first innings lead,
striking with his first and second balls of his 21st over.
	   Skipper Arjuna Ranatunga (51), added just one run in eight balls
before he shuffled across a Gough-delivery and was trapped leg
before wicket.
	   Another left-hander, Hashan Tillakaratne (0), was trapped plumb
in front with a full length delivery and Sri Lanka had slumped to
450 for five.
	   Aravinda de Silva, who had anchored the innings patiently, and
Romesh Kaluwitharana (25) figured in a brief 38-run stand for the
sixth wicket.
	   De Silva, playing in his 74th test, reached his 150 but four
balls later edged a Ben Hollioake outswinger to wicketkeeper Alec
Stewart.
	   De Silva batted for 42 minutes over seven hours for his 152
runs, sharing two important stands _ a record 243 for the third
with Sanath Jayasuriya (213), and 122 with Ranatunga for the fourth
wicket.
	   The right hander hit 17 boundaries off 292 balls.
	   Kaluwitharana fell before de Silva, an uppish drive was well
caught on the rebound by John Crawley at short extra cover off
Dominic Cork.
	   Ranatunga's innings included seven boundaries and a six while
Kaluwitharana hit two fours in his 58-minute stay at the crease.
	   Kumara Dharmasena and Suresh Perera were unbeaten at the break
on 13 and two respectively.
	   Gough, Hollioake and Cork took two wickets apiece.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Some 600 foreign workers will lose their jobs in
the Communications Ministry next March as part of the government's
program to make room for Kuwaiti nationals, Al-Siyassah daily
reported Sunday.
	   The newspaper said a document signed by the minister, Sheik Ali
Salem al-Ali al-Sabah, stated that the services of the foreigners
would no longer be needed as of March 30.
	   Kuwaiti graduates have complained of trouble getting government
jobs, which for decades have been considered a way through which
the country distributes its considerable oil wealth.
	   Foreigners make up the majority of Kuwait's 2.1 million
population, with most working in the private sector. Kuwait's
800,000 nationals mainly take government jobs.
 &UR; ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt has set up a company to manufacture
steel pipes and other products, the Al-Ahram daily reported Sunday.
	   The Aswan Iron and Steel Co. will have an initial capitalization
of 517 million Egyptian pounds (dlrs 152 million), the newspaper
said.
	   The paper quoted Zafer el-Bishry, minister of state for planning
and international cooperation, as saying the company will turn out
2 million tons of iron and steel in its first phase of production,
scheduled to begin in May 2001. The company will be headquartered
in Aswan, which is 700 kilometers (440 miles) south of Cairo.
	   The government aims to increase the company's capital to 816
million pounds (dlrs 240 million) by selling shares to the public,
el-Bishry was quoted as saying.
	   The company will employ some 3,000 workers.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will export 400 tons of shrimp this
year, a 280 ton increase from last year's exports, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday.
	   Iran plans to exploit the potential for fish farming in the
northwestern Khuzestan province by developing shrimp and fish
farming, IRNA quoted a senior official as saying.
	   Noting the high profits that can be earned in the fish farming
field, the official called on the government to increase its
investments in the sector.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The price of gold fell 5.2 percent in the
past week to 6.4 Jordanian dinars (dlrs 8.9) for a kilogram (35
ounces), the Central Bank of Jordan said Sunday.
	   ``The drop in gold prices is the result of a cash crunch and
economic recession,'' said Michel Nino, a manager at the Blue
Diamond Jewelry.
	   Nino told The Associated Press that a recent sale of Russian
gold on the international market also contributed to receding
prices in Jordan.
	   He said that if gold prices continued to drop, jewelers could
lose between dlrs 20,000 and dlrs 150,000 each this year because of
devalued inventories.
	   There are 400 jewelry firms in Jordan.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Proceeds from sales taxes fell 11.7 percent
to 154 million dinars (dlrs 217 million) in the first half of 1998
compared with the January-June period in 1997, the Finance Ministry
said Sunday.
	   But revenues from customs increased 11 percent to 134.6 million
dinars (dlrs 189.6 million), it said.
	   Economists blamed the fall in sales tax revenue to weak economic
growth.
	   The Jordanian economy grew just 0.8 percent in 1997 after
showing no growth the previous year. The economy grew 4 percent in
1995. Inflation currently is estimated at about 6 percent.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ One year on the flowers are once again being laid
at the gates of Kensington Palace, the home of Princess Diana which
became a magnet for a grieving nation following her tragic death a
year ago Monday.
	   There were a few tears Sunday but the scene was more of a
tourist spectacle _ visitors placing bouquets, then stopping to
take photographs. By midday, there were about 500 floral tributes
along the palace gates.
	   In Scotland, Diana's sons, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry,
13, attended church services near Balmoral Castle with their father
Prince Charles, grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, and other members
of the royal family. The young princes will return to Crathie
village church on Monday for a private service in memory of their
mother.
	   The boys were vacationing at Balmoral when the were awakened in
the early morning hours of Aug. 31 and told that their mother had
been killed in a car crash in Paris along with her companion Dodi
Fayed and driver Henri Paul.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, who are guests
of the queen at Balmoral _ an annual ritual for British leaders _
attended Sunday's Church of Scotland service and will also attend
Monday's prayers for the princess.
	   Diana's brother and sisters and their families plan to mark the
anniversary nearly 500 miles (800 km) south at Althorp, the
Spencers' ancestral home, where the princess is buried on an
island.
	   Earl Spencer on Sunday thanked members of the Northamptonshire
County Cricket Club for their support and solidarity during the
``turbulent year'' since his sister's death. He spoke at the
opening of an indoor cricket center at the club, near his home.
	   Treasury chief Gordon Brown, chairman of the Diana Princess of
Wales Memorial Committee, said in a BBC Radio 1 interview to be
broadcast Sunday night that her legacy will stay with people for
the rest of their lives.
	   ``I think her legacy is that she has made not only Britain a
better place but she's made hundreds of thousands of people in
Britain feel more confident about what they can do to make Britain
a better place,'' he said.
	   She meant a lot to many people, he said, ``because she had shone
a torch into areas of life that a lot of people had been happy to
forget'' like AIDS and landmines.
	   Brown stressed that the committee, charged with deciding on a
suitable memorial to the princess, is trying to carry on Diana's
work _ ``not some physical memorial but to continue her work.''
	   The committee has made several proposals including a garden near
Kensington Palace, a medal for schoolchildren involved in community
service, a new 5-pound coin, and a program providing nurses to
children with life-threatening or severely disabling illnesses.
	   While weekend newspapers from tabloids to the highbrow carried
tributes to the princess, essays on why her death was - or wasn't -
important, and pullout supplements carrying her most well-known
images, a poll indicated that only 6 percent of Britons plan to
observe the anniversary.

Ozaki wins third straight Hisamitsu KBC Augusta crown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, Japan's winningest
golfer, shot an even-par 72 Sunday and won his third straight
Hisamitsu KBC Augusta crown by four strokes.
	   The 51-year-old Ozaki scattered three birdies and three bogeys
en route to a 13-under 275 total.
	   The victory, Ozaki's second of the year and 108th overall, was
worth 18 million yen (dlrs 125,000) from a purse of 100 million yen
(dlrs 699,000).
	   ``In order not to incur the gallery's possible hatred at having
the same guy win again and again, I might seek second place next
year,'' Ozaki said.
	   ``It was so windy and I made a bad start with the bogey at No.
1, the toughest hole for me out there,'' said Ozaki. The par-4
first hole has a narrow fairway and punitive rough on either side.
	   ``But I knew there would be very few low scores today,'' Ozaki
said.
	   With the victory, Ozaki stands second on this year's money list
with 76.2 million yen (dlrs 533,000). He trails American Brandt
Jobe, who has so far earned 77.4 million yen (dlrs 541,300).
	   Ozaki has been the Japan PGA Tour's top money earner in 11
seasons, including the last four in a row.
	   Up-and-coming Katsunori Kuwabara fired a 73 and was alone in
second place at 279. He was in contention for his second victory on
the tour. He won his only career victory in the 1995 Acom
International.
	   Kazuhiro Takami shot a 69 for 280, followed by Nobumitsu Yuhara
and four others tied for fourth at 282.

Philippine president to fight congress over special funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said Sunday
he will fight any attempt by lawmakers to reintroduce special funds
for congressional members in next year's proposed budget.
	   Estrada is in for what could be bruising battle with the
Philippine Congress after he abolished the funds in the 579.5
billion peso (dlrs 13.8 billion) budget he submitted for
congressional approval last week.
	   The funds for lawmakers' pet infrastructure projects have been
widely suspected of being a main source of graft.
	   Many congressional members have said they would find ways of
reinserting the funds into the 1999 budget. Some are planning to
stall the approval of the budget, which would technically allow
them to retain access to the funds next year.
	   Estrada told reporters he would veto any attempt by congress to
bring back the funds.
	   Lawmakers said the money allows them to ensure funding for
certain projects, usually basketball courts, pedestrian sheds,
water pumps, deep wells, village roads, for their constituencies.
	   Estrada has called the funds ``immoral'' and said congressmen
must stick to their role of law-making and leave public works to
the government.
	   Roman Catholic bishops, who have been critical of some of
Estrada's recent policies, have backed the former movie actor in
removing the funds.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said he hoped lawmakers
would consider the country's economic difficulties and approve the
proposed budget before the end of the year.
	   Estrada has told lawmakers that the budget reflects the need to
rein in expenses due to a huge budget deficit this year.
	   The budget, which is 7.3 percent higher than that of the current
year, allocates 159.4 billion pesos (dlrs 3.8 billion), or 27.5
percent, to social services including education, health, social
welfare and agrarian reform.
	   Officials said 16.3 percent, or about 94.6 billion pesos (dlrs
2.2 billion) will go to the economic services sector, including
agriculture, power, transport and communications, local
governments.
	   The Philippines government is projecting a budget deficit of 40
billion (dlrs 952 million) this year but says that could drop to
17.9 billion pesos (dlrs 426 million) next year with an austerity
program and an aggressive revenue collection drive.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ One person was killed and two went missing Sunday

and sent waters gushing from streams in northeastern Japan.
	   The downpour caused by Typhoon Rex has claimed 14 lives and
injured 40 since Thursday. Among the dead were five people who were
buried in a mudslide in Fukushima prefectures, 240 kilometers (150
miles) northeast of Tokyo. Five people were still missing.
	   On Sunday, 73-year-old woman died after being buried under a
landslide while clearing the debris from an earlier landslide
behind her home in Fukushima, police said.
	   Police said casualties and damage had spread to at least 22
prefectures (states), as of 5 p.m. Sunday. About 10,000 people were
evacuted from their homes Sunday in Shizuoka Prefecture, west of
Tokyo.
	   A 58-year-old woman went missing Sunday after a bulging river
swallowed her in Iwate Prefecture (state), 460 kilometers (290
miles) north of Tokyo. And in Ashikaga, 80 kilometers (48 miles)
northwest of Tokyo, a 26-year-old man fell into a swollen
irrigation channel and has not been found.
	   Rescue workers digging in mud have been unable to find the three
people who were swept downstream after a river burst Thursday in
Tochigi, 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Tokyo, they said.
	   More than 10,000 homes have been flooded, destroyed or partly
destroyed, and the number of mudslides climbed Sunday to 715 from
575 Saturday, police said.
	   In Tochigi prefecture, about 450 cows drowned or went missing as
cow sheds were washed away, causing 234 million yen (dlrs 1.6
million) in damage, said Toshihiro Yoshizawa, a spokesman of the
Tochigi prefectural government.
	   The Central Meteorogical Agency said that Rex, packing winds of
up to 126 kph (80 mph), was located about 650 kilometers (390
miles) south of Tokyo as of 6 p.m. (0900gmt) Sunday. Rex was moving
toward north-northeast at a speed of 10 kilometers (6 miles) per
hour, it said.
	   Rains were likely to continue for the next two or three days
because Rex was moving so slowly. It could come near the eastern
Japanese coast by Monday night, the agency said.
	   Heavy rain and flood warnings were issued Sunday throughout
regions in northeastern Japan, including Tokyo and Gunma, Ibaraki,
Tochigi and Saitama prefectures.
	   Rainfall was expected to hit as high as 60 millimeters (2.5
inches) per hour in some areas, the agency said.
	   Nationwide TV news showed cars swimming through currents
swerving through residential streets.
	   Bullet trains and several other lines throughout northern Japan
and areas near Tokyo were disrupted, with stops or slow-downs, a
railway spokesman said.

 &UR; Major crash halts Belgian Grand Prix on opening lap &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details, COMBINES takes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ One of the biggest crashes in
Formula One history interrupted the Belgian Grand Prix on the
opening lap Sunday, but no driver appeared to be seriously injured.
	   The accident involving a dozen cars happened just after the
opening La Source hairpin when the 22 cars started accelerating on
the downward section to Eau Rouge. David Coulthard was in third
position when his McLaren-Mercedes veered into the protective wall
and bounced back onto the track.
	   His car was hit by several other drivers and tires and debris
went flying everywhere. Only 10 cars escaped the crash. The drivers
were able to walk back to the pits to prepare the backup cars.
	   Eddie Irvine was limping slightly and Rubens Barrichello was
holding his arm on the walk back. No other drivers appeared to have
been injured. Irvine prepared to restart the race.
	   After two days of relatively dry conditions, the Belgian Grand
Prix started in rain and when Coulthard crashed, those who followed
where unable to react because of the sheets of spray coming off the
leading cars.
	   ``I saw nothing. I saw crashes everywhere. I couldn't stop,''
French driver Olivier Panis said. His car was a total wreck.
	   It was the third day running that serious accidents marred the
Belgian Grand Prix weekend.
	   On Friday, reigning world champion Jacques Villeneuve lost
control of his Williams-Mecachrome on the famed Eau-Rouge corner at
some 290 kph (180 mph) and crashed backward into a protective tire
barrier. He was not hurt.
	   On Saturday, the infamous Eau Rouge corner claimed yet another
victim.
	   Finland's Mika Salo lost control of his Arrows-Yamaha at almost
the exact same uphill spot during morning practice and his car
slammed into protective tires at high speed before spinning four
times on the track and coming to a standstill.
	   World standings leader Mika Hakkinen was on pole and avoided the
carnage while Villeneuve had moved up from sixth position on the
grid into second and was also not affected when third-place
Coulthard had his accident.

Report: illegal immigrants drown off Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Two Chinese illegal immigrants drowned and
two others were missing after the crew of a fishing boat they paid
to smuggle them into Taiwan dropped them off on a sandbar in the
middle of the night, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Five men and two women survived the ordeal and were rescued by a
different fishing boat early Saturday, the United Daily News said.
The immigrants were residents of China's Fujian province, just
across the Taiwan Strait, who hoped to find better paying work in
Taiwan.
	   The rescued told police they paid 10,000 yuan (U.S. dlrs 1,219)
each for passage to Taiwan under cover of darkness. Before dawn,
they were told they had arrived at the central Taiwan coast and
ordered off the boat into waist-deep water, only to discover land
was far off.
	   Two men drowned and two others were swept away when the tide
rose, and the others survived by clinging to pieces of driftwood,
the paper said.

Taiwan's Vice President cleared of improper loan allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ An investigation has cleared Vice
President Lien Chan and his wife of allegations they made an
improper loan to an official later convicted of corruption, news
reports said Sunday.
	   The Taipei prosecutor's office said investigations into Lien's
36 million Taiwan dollar (U.S. dlrs 1 million) loan to Wu Tse-yuan
showed it was purely intended to support Wu's campaign for chief of
Pingtung county, local media reported.
	   Wu won that campaign, but was convicted in 1997 of taking
kickbacks and sentenced to 15 years in prison.
	   Opposition politicians suggested the loan was a bribe for Wu's
granting bids for a pumping station and water treatment plant in
his former post as a local official responsible for infrastructure
development. Others alleged the money was used by Wu to illegally
speculate on real estate for Lien.
	   Lien, one of Taiwan's richest politicians, has apologized for
not listing the 1993 loan in financial declaration forms required
of all government officials. The corruption allegations were seen
as a public relations setback for Lien, who is considered to be
President Lee Teng-hui's choice as his successor in elections in
2000.

High court overturns libel conviction of journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's highest court on Sunday overturned
the conviction of a journalist who has served more than five months
of a six-month prison term and ordered a retrial.
	   Security officials said the Court of Cessation found ``mistakes
of technicality'' in a lower court's ruling of libel against Gamal
Fahmy.
	   The officials said they expected Fahmy to be released
immediately. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Fahmy, managing editor of the now-defunct Al-Dustour daily,
began serving a six-month jail term on March 21 after he was
convicted of libeling Tharwat Abaza, a member of parliament who
also writes for a pro-government newspaper.
	   The case involved an article Fahmy wrote for Al-Arabi newspaper
in which he alleged that Abaza's father was a British sympathizer
during Britain's occupation of Egypt.
	   Fahmy's jailing came amid a crackdown by the government on
Egypt's lively independent press.
	   Four other journalists also were sentenced to prison in libel
convictions since January, but the Court of Cessation has
overturned all the convictions.
	   Scores of other journalists still face pending libel charges.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARBIN, China (AP) _ Their homes drowned by muddy, fetid
floodwaters, refugees huddle with their pigs, cows and dogs under
cramped lean-tos on high ground.
	   Furniture, wet clothes and whatever other belongings people
managed to salvage are piled nearby. In the filthy, hot and humid
conditions, diarrhea, skin diseases and stress thrive. Drinking
water is short, discomfort plentiful.
	   Such is the misery wrought by floods that have ravaged China for
more than two months, inundating towns and villages, washing away
roads, railways and bridges. The human toll: at least 3,000 dead,
millions more homeless. By government count, 223 million people _
nearly the population of the United States _ have been affected.
	   But in the upended lives and wrecked communities, there may be
some good for China's embattled environment.
	   Facing mounting criticism from outcast dissidents as well as
senior legislators, officials have acknowledged an unpalatable
truth: Misuse of land and other human mistakes _ not just
persistent, torrential rains _ played a role in the floods'
ferocity.
	   Criticism focused on unrestrained logging that increased water
runoff and the destruction of vital lakes that could have absorbed
increased flow along the Yangtze, the world's third longest river
that has seen its worst flooding in 44 years. Critics also said
flood controls were neglected.
	   The response: a new government ban on logging on the Yangtze's
upper reaches, plans to reverse the damaging human invasion of its
lakes and calls for more investment in flood control.
	   ``We have asked a lot of nature. Now we are going to give back
to nature,'' Zhao Qizheng, the top government spokesman, told
reporters last week.
	   The summer rainy season brings floods to China every year. But
this year's storms were earlier, heavier and more widespread than
normal _ in part due to El Nino, the global weather phenomenon.
	   Deadly flooding hit the usually arid northwest. Mudslides and
flash floods engulfed villages. In Wuhan, an industrial city of 7
million, people waded through waist-deep water; ducks paddled down
flooded streets.
	   The rains caused rivers _ including the 3,900-mile (6,275
kilometer) Yangtze _ to rise, first to warning levels, then to
record levels, and then beyond.
	   In Hubei and Hunan, badly hit provinces crisscrossed by the
Yangtze and its tributaries, floodwaters only had to rise a few
feet (meters) in some areas to overwhelm dikes and inundate the
countryside.
	   The flatness of the surrounding farmland allowed floodwaters to
spread in some places for miles (kilometers), forming placid lakes
broken only by dikes and the raised beds of train tracks.
	   The government already has the mammoth Three Gorges Dam, the
world's largest hydroelectric project, under construction in the
middle reaches of the Yangtze in Hubei, and officials say one of
its main purposes is to prevent such flooding.
	   Critics, however, say the dam will not be big enough to hold
back the Yangtze and its tributaries at flood times. They also
question whether dam operators will discharge water to prevent
flooding upriver instead of keeping reservoir levels high for
generating electricity.
	   In the northeast, a region bordering Russia where winters are
bitterly cold, 1 million people are homeless. Already, evacuees in
makeshift lean-tos are shivering through nights as temperatures
drop to around 50 F (10 C).
	   Because flood fighting efforts focused on saving cities, farmers
have often been among the worst affected. Some rural areas were
inundated deliberately to relieve pressure on levees safeguarding
urban areas.
	   ``It's disastrous. We couldn't get our possessions out,'' said
Shi Baohuai, whose village near the northeastern industrial center
of Harbin was flooded by the bloated Songhua River. ``We can't
start over again; we haven't got any money.''
	   Short-term, government leaders hope rebuilding after floodwaters
recede will boost the flagging economy, pushing them closer to
their goal of 8 percent economic growth this year.
	   But long-term, the flooding's environmental message may be the
most far-reaching, belatedly concentrating government leaders'
minds on the destruction of nature that has accompanied China's
rush for development.
	   ``This flooding should be a very important pivotal moment,
giving them a very big lesson,'' said Dai Qing, an author and
persistent critic of government policies.
	   The new logging ban taking effect on the Yangtze's upper reaches
on Sept. 1 will be accompanied by loggers given work planting and
protecting trees, state news media said.
	   Deforestation has denuded hills, making them unable to absorb
rain. Water rushes down, triggering mudslides and washing soil into
rivers. There, it silts up channels and raises water levels,
worsening floods.
	   Silting also has combined with human encroachment to shrink
Yangtze basin lakes, reducing their effectiveness as sponges to
soak up floods. Hubei province had 1,066 lakes in the 1950s. Now it
has 325, and three-quarters of those are shrunken.
	   ``For so many years, by blindly following the concept that `man
can conquer nature,' we have built up vast, evil debts to the
Yangtze River,'' 309 dissidents said last week in the largest
petition since the military crushed the Tiananmen Square democracy
movement nine years ago.
	   ``We are now swallowing the bitter fruit of nature's revenge,''
they said.

Summer on Mont Blanc: balmy weather hides treacherous dangers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ All it takes is rain at high altitude and the
popular slopes of Mont Blanc, Europe's highest mountain, turn into
a treacherous wall of ice.
	   In seven days, 14 climbers have fallen to their deaths, many of
them plunging several hundred meters (yards.) The scenario is the
same almost every summer, and authorities in the popular resort are
once again urging climbers to be extra vigilant.
	   ``Many amateurs come to Mont Blanc and choose not to hire a
guide, and that's a risky business,'' said Pierre Raveneau,
spokesman for the mountain gendarmes in the popular Alps resort.
	   ``Nobody's obliged, but the advice you see everywhere is to go
with an expert. It's always the best step.''
	   Mont Blanc rises to 4,800 meters (15,750 feet) between the
borders of France and Italy.
	   In summer, warm weather and blue skies draw thousands of
tourists, hikers and climbers. But the balmy weather hides
treacherous dangers: slippery ice and hidden crevasses.
	   Last summer, more than 60 people were killed in the Alps in
climbing accidents.
	   Rescue workers using helicopters have had to pluck 14 corpses
from Mont Blanc's peak this month. All the victims plunged to their
deaths from the rain-slicked face after snow turned to ice.
	   The victims included Spanish, German, Hungarian, Italian and
French climbers. None of them had a guide.
	   Rain at high altitude is rare. Even usually safe routes, such as
the Dome du Gouter at an altitude of 14,400 feet, were hazardous
this year after the rain. Two of the victims perished there.
	   But the deaths are often a result of negligence borne of
over-confidence, experts say.
	   ``Accidents almost always happen when climbers are descending,''
said local guide Michel Schneider. ``That's when complacency sets
in and people lose their concentration, after perhaps having made
the summit.''
	   Several hundred climbers scale the peak each day in summer,
authorities say. But even at low altitudes, where crampons might be
considered superfluous, there are dangers.
	   ``If a mountaineer comes without crampons, or sufficient
knowledge of how to use them in different conditions, then there
will be difficulties,'' said Raveneau.
	   Schneider, the guide, said the mountain shouldn't be considered
highly dangerous if the right precautions are taken.
	   ``There's a very big difference between being difficult and
dangerous,'' he said.
	   ``But if you lose your focus, a slip can be fatal. The margin of
error can be minute.''

<TEXT>
	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ One of the biggest crashes in
Formula One history interrupted the Belgian Grand Prix on the
opening lap Sunday, but no driver was seriously injured.
	   The accident involving a dozen cars happened just after the
opening La Source hairpin when the 22 cars started accelerating on
the downward section to Eau Rouge. David Coulthard was in third
position when his McLaren-Mercedes suddenly veered into the
protective wall and bounced back onto the track.
	   His car was hit by several other drivers and immediately tires
and debris went flying everywhere. Only 10 cars escaped the crash.
	   The race resumed with almost an hour delay, after all the car
wrecks and debris were removed off the track.
	   The drivers were able to walk back to the pits to prepare the
backup cars. Eddie Irvine was limping slightly and Rubens
Barrichello was holding his arm on the walk back. No other drivers
were hurt in the horrifying accident. Irvine restarted the race.
	   World standings leader was out of the race on the first hairpin
when he spun on the track, trying to hold off Michael Schumacher,
and was hit by the onrushing Sauber Petronas of Johnny Herbert.

Quakes shake Etna volcano, watched by scientists,
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CATANIA, Sicily (AP) _ A series of earthquakes has rattled Mount
Etna, putting on alert Sunday a team of scientists monitoring the
volcano for a possible eruption.
	   By mid-morning Sunday, at least seven quakes had been registered
in a 24-hour period, although none of the temblors was sharp enough
to be felt by the people who live in small towns on the volcano's
slopes, the Italian news agency ANSA reported from this eastern
Sicilian city.
	   The latest quake had a preliminary magnitude of 2.3, the report
said.
	   Experts have said there is no telling when the volcano might
erupt. Etna has been spewing smoke and sending up showers of hot
lava rock off and on for months.

Religious meeting seeks to bring together Western, Eastern
</HEADLINE>
Christians and others &QL; 
 &UR; By ALISON MUTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Eastern and Western Christians and
other religious leaders from some 50 countries were converging
Sunday on this former Communist capital to preach peace and
understanding among all people.
	   ``Before 1989 (when communism fell), ecumenism was a foreign
exercise,'' said Theodor Baconski, Romania's ambassador to the
Vatican, referring to decades of state persecution of religious
believers.
	   ``Now we have reached a kind of spiritual maturity,'' he said.
	   The interdenominational gathering, comprising Christians,
Muslims, Buddhists and Jews, is scheduled to open later Sunday.
	   It was preceded hours earlier by an open-air Orthodox church
service.
	   Most of the guests attending the two-day event gathered on the
hill of Bucharest Patriarchy, taking seats on a platform around
President Emil Constantinescu.
	   ``Jesus' blood is the way for all people to reconcile with
God'', said Peter VII, patriarch of Alexandria and all Africa.
	   Israel's Chief Rabbi Meir Lau, eight Catholic cardinals and
Islamic leaders are at the two-day event. American Sister Helen
Prejean, whose opposition to the death penalty was portrayed by
Susan Sarandon in the film ``Dead Man Walking,'' will give a talk.
Sarandon won an Oscar for her role.
	   Romania's presidential office, the Romanian Orthodox Church and
Italian Catholic organization called San' Egidio s are the hosts.
Catholic sponsors raised some dlrs 350,000 for the event, said
Mario Marazziti, a spokesman for the Italians.
	   Prior to the church meeting, questions were raised about the
timing of the conference despite an ongoing dispute inside the
Orthodoxy between the patriarchy in Moscow and Istanbul and a
church quarrel in Romania.
	   In Romania, the disagreement is over church property Eastern
Rite Catholics request to be returned from the Orthodox Church.
	   Critics noted several Orthodox Church leaders stayed away and
Protestants were thin on the ground. In addition to Peter VII, the
only other heads of national Orthodox Churches were Romania's
Patriarch Teoctist and Patriarch Chrysostomos of Cyprus.
	   One of the aims of the conference is to set the stage for a
visit by Pope John Paul II, who was invited by Constantinescu to
come to Romania in May 1999.
	   However, the papal visit requires the blessing of the Romanian
Orthodox Church, who has set certain conditions.
	   It would be the first visit by the pope to an Orthodox country
since the schism between Rome and Constantinople in 1054. Almost 90
percent of Romanians adhere to the Orthodox creed.
	   The Orthodox want Romania's 300,000-strong Eastern Rite
Catholics, the country's second largest church, to drop demands for
the return of hundreds of churches seized by the Communists and
given to the Orthodox in 1948. They also want Catholics to stop
calling them ``Communist collaborators.''
	   There are about 300 million Orthodox worldwide. Many believers
lived in Communist countries where religious freedoms were
curtailed until recently. After the fall of communism, the church
has played a greater role in these societies.
	   The daily Ziua reported on Saturday that Romanian security
forces were on alert for possible terrorist attacks.

Russian military to shut down last Baltic outpost

	   SKRUNDA, Latvia (AP) _ The last Russian military operation in
the Baltics ends Monday when the Skrunda radar station stops
scanning the western skies. Decommissioning the base marks the end
of a resented military presence of more than a half-century.
	   ``We Latvians never wanted that thing here in the first place,''
said 26-year-old Inara Karklis last week as she stood outside the
post office in this dusty two 120 kilometers west of the capital,
Riga. ``We're certainly not going to miss it when it is turned off
and hauled away.''
	   The Soviet Union annexed Latvia and its Baltic neighbors
Lithuania and Estonia at the start of World War II. Over the
decades, tens of thousands of troops were brought in and hundreds
of military bases were established.
	   Following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, the Kremlin
pulled almost all of its soldiers out of the Baltics. Except for
those manning Skrunda, the withdrawal was completed in 1994.
	   But Russia insisted on being able to continue to operate the
Skrunda base, manned by about 400 soldiers. As the Kremlin's
westernmost radar base it was a key link in Russia's
missile-defense system.
	   Under a lease grudgingly agreed to by Latvia, Moscow paid dlrs 5
million a year to continue the Skrunda operation and promised to
switch the radar off by August 31, 1998. The agreement then allows
Russia another 18 months to dismantle the equipment.
	   Despite the importance of the base, Moscow has not tried to
extend the lease, Latvian officials say.
	   ``No such requests were ever made by Russia,'' said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Andrejs Pildegovics. ``The agreement was
fulfilled perfectly, without any problems.''
	   Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency last week quoted an unnamed
Russian Defense Ministry official as saying that the loss of
Skrunda would not weaken the nation's defenses. He said existing
radar stations could take up the slack and suggested that a new
radar installation might be built in Belarus, which borders Latvia
to the east.
	   The implementation of the Skrunda agreement is a bright spot in
Russia-Latvia relations, which have been troubled this year by
harsh words from both sides over Moscow's charges that Latvia is
discriminating against its huge Russian-speaking minority.
	   Jurgen Hubschen, a regional representative for the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the Skrunda agreement
bodes well for future relations.
	   ``It definitely builds up confidence between the two
countries,'' he said. ``It shows that Latvians and Russians are
able to rely on each other.''
	   Pildegovics, the foreign ministry offical, agreed.
	   ``This has been a unique experience for Latvia and Russia,'' he
said. ``There aren't that many examples between us of long,
complicated agreements being fulfilled like this. It's a nice
precedent.''
	   The base is off-limits to journalists. Latvian government
officials also had to ask permission before entering.

Flood waters surge downstream on China's Yangtze River
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's flood control headquarters sent an urgent
appeal to soldiers and civilians already worn down from a
summer-long battle against floods, urging them Sunday to keep up
the fight.
	   Another flood crest rolled down the Yangtze River, China's
longest river. It has been hit by the heaviest flooding since 1954,
when more than 30,000 people were killed.
	   This year's floods have killed more than 3,000 people
nationwide.
	   The latest flood crest, the eighth this summer, passed Chongqing
in southwest China, and waters were rising in Yichang, in central
China's Hubei province, on the middle reaches of the Yangtze, state
television reported Sunday.
	   Flood control officials urged the millions of people patrolling
important dikes along the river and on Dongting Lake to work hard
guarding danger points, People's Daily reported Sunday.
	   State news media warned that in the past oversaturated dikes
often have given way as water levels dropped.
	   The floods since mid-June have affected 2.1 million hectares (5
million acres) of farmland nationwide, according to official
figures.
	   Agriculture experts have been mobilized to advise farmers on how
to save late rice and cotton crops where waters have receded and to
provide seeds for cash crops to help farmers make up for lost
income, the China Daily reported.
	   In addition to the heavily populated Yangtze basin, China's
unusually heavy summer floods have struck on rivers in the
northeast and in Tibet.
	   After many years of rapid growth at the expense of the
environment, China is being forced by this year's severe flooding
to acknowledge the costs of environmental devastation.
	   Development on wetlands has reduced their ability to absorb
floodwaters. In addition, deforestation has worsened flooding in
the Yangtze basin. With no trees to soak up the water, soil erodes
from hillsides and silts up river beds.
	   A recent ban on logging in western Sichuan province, along the
upper reaches of the Yangtze, was scheduled to go into effect
Tuesday. About 45,000 loggers would lose their jobs cutting trees,
but most would be re-employed in reforestation and forest
protection, the Economic Daily reported.
	   It said logging in the area had been so extensive that there
were hardly any trees left to cut. Tons of soil eroding into the
Yangtze River is endangering the area that will become the
reservoir of the Three Gorges Dam, scheduled for completion in
2009, and downstream areas, the report said.

Kabila flies to Zimbabwe to thank Mugabe for help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Congo's President Laurent Kabila flew
Sunday to Zimbabwe for talks with President Robert Mugabe, who has
sent troops to help Kabila stem rebels fighting to oust the leader.
	   Mugabe met the Congolese leader at the airport, officials said.
	   Kabila was ``expected to personally express his gratitude to
Mugabe for Zimbabwe's support in the fight against Rwanda and Tutsi
rebels'', officials said.
	   Mugabe spearheaded military intervention from Zimbabwe, Angola
and Namibia, despite warnings from other southern African countries
that the move threatened regional security.
	   Kabila claims that Rwanda and Uganda are backing ethnic Tutsi
rebels trying to unseat his year-old government.
	   The two countries have denied the charges, but Rwanda's Foreign
Minister Anastase Gasana told reporters Saturday in Durban, South
Africa, that his government would send troops into Congo if peace
efforts failed. Gasana was in Durban for the Nonaligned Movement
summit.
	   Summit organizers have said they did not expect Kabila to attend
the summit, where the Congo crisis was expected to dominate
discussion among global delegates who started arriving on Saturday.
	   Summit officials denied reports that Kabila's foes would also
attend the summit, saying the misunderstanding came from an
outdated delegate list that included former Congo Foreign Minister
Bizima Karaha, who has joined the rebels.
	   Zambia's President Frederick Chiluba met with Mugabe on
Saturday, and defended military intervention to back Kabila _ even
though Zambia has not sent troops to Congo.
	   ``A rebellion is a rebellion and must be crushed,'' Chiluba
said.
	   Mugabe also met with Ethiopia's President Meles Zenawi in Harare
on Sunday. Zenawi was on his way to the summit.
	   The government has not announced the number of troops it has
sent to Congo, but state controlled media Sunday trumpeted battle
successes, saying Zimbabwe-led allied forces had smashed rebel
resistance on the Kinshasa-Ndhili International Airport road on
Saturday and opened Kinshasa's food supplies route.
	   The coalition force of ethnic Tutsi fighters and disenchanted
members of Kabila's military is trying to oust Kabila.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Irish President Mary McAleese declared Sunday
that the people of Ireland were united in repudiating terrorist
bombings, causing a crowd of Irish expatriates in Singapore to
break into sustained applause.
	   Addressing a crowd of about 150 Irish people at a reception in a
Singapore hotel, McAleese said that Ireland had rallied against
terrorism by voting for a peace accord to end decades of civil
strife in Northern Ireland.
	   ``The perpetrators of the Omagh bombing ... were repudiated even
before the bombing in the referendum,'' she said.
	   McAleese called the Aug. 15 bombing, which killed 28 people and
wounded more than 330, the worst act of terrorism during the modern
period of Irish troubles, and said the tragedy was a test of
whether the peace accord would hold.
	   But she stressed that the people of Ireland had come together in
condemning the perpetrators.
	   ``There no longer is any space for them in Ireland. We want them
gone,'' McAleese said at the reception at the Ritz Carlton Hotel.
	   She said the agreement had never guaranteed an immediate end to
violence but was ``a balanced, comprehensive, fair framework for
what we hope will be a new peaceful era. ...''
	   McAleese chatted with every one of the guests at the party, her
last engagement during a weekend stopover on the way to a state
visit to Australia and New Zealand.
	   It was her first visit to Asia as president, and she toured
Chinatown, the Singapore Zoo and had lunch Sunday with Singapore
President Ong Ten Cheong.
	   McAleese said she had learned during her lunch conversation
about the city-state's conscious effort to celebrate the ethnic,
cultural and religious differences of its 3.1 million people, and
that Ireland was trying to accept diversity as well.
	   ``We are in the process of learning to celebrate diversity,
rather than be frightened by it,'' she said.
	   McAleese told the Irish expatriates that their homeland is now
the success story of Europe, with the lowest unemployment in the
European Union and the world's second largest software exporting
industry after the United States.
	   She was accompanied by her husband, Martin, and Ireland's
minister for the environment and local government, Noel Dempsey,
who met during the lunch with Singapore's health and environment
minister, Yeo Cheow Tong.

	   LONDON (AP) _ One year on the flowers are once again being laid
at the gates of Kensington Palace, the home of Princess Diana which
became a magnet for a grieving nation following her tragic death a
year ago Monday.
	   There were a few tears Sunday but the scene was more of a
tourist spectacle _ visitors placing bouquets, then stopping to
take photographs. By midday, there were about 500 floral tributes
along the palace gates.
	   In Scotland, Diana's sons, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry,
13, attended church services near Balmoral Castle with their father
Prince Charles, grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, and other members
of the royal family. The young princes will return to Crathie
village church on Monday for a private service in memory of their
mother.
	   The boys were vacationing at Balmoral when the were awakened in
the early morning hours of Aug. 31 and told that their mother had
been killed in a car crash in Paris along with her companion Dodi
Fayed and driver Henri Paul.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, who are guests
of the queen at Balmoral _ an annual ritual for British leaders _
attended Sunday's Church of Scotland service and will also attend
Monday's prayers for the princess.
	   Diana was not mentioned by name during the service at Crathie,
but she was remembered at services at Westminster Abbey in London,
where her funeral was held.
	   During prayers for the dead, Precentor of the Abbey, the Rev.
Dominic Fenton, said: ``And we particularly remember Diana,
Princess of Wales, the first anniversary of whose death is
tomorrow.''

Swallows beat Dragons 5-3 in 12 innings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Eric Anthony singled home two runs in the 12th
inning as the Yakult Swallows beat the Central League's
second-place Chunichi Dragons 5-3 at Nagoya Dome Sunday and
extended their winning streak to five.
	   Anthony, formerly with the Los Angeles Dodgers, hit the
game-winning single after the bases were loaded on two hits and a
walk.
	   The Dragons are now two games behind the front-running Yokohama
BayStars whose scheduled game with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp at
Yokohama was rained out.
	   At Tokyo Dome, former Chicago Cubs player Dave Hansen doubled
home a run in the two-run sixth inning to lead the Hanshin Tigers
to a 5-2 victory over the Yomiuri Giants.
	   Hanshin hurler Ben Rivera, formerly with the Philadelphia
Phillies, pitched an inning of perfect relief in the ninth to earn
his 19th save this season. He is 2-3.
	   In the Pacific League, the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks scored seven runs
in the fourth inning and went on to beat the front-running Nippon
Ham Fighters 8-5 at Fukuoka Dome.
	   In the fourth, the Hawks drew four walks and had two hits off
Fighters starter Kip Gross before he was relieved by Junji Kuroki.
Gross, formerly with Los Angeles Dodgers, took his first loss
against no wins.
	   The Fighters are still two games ahead of the Seibu Lions who
moved into the second place as the Kintetsu Buffaloes lost to the
Orix BlueWave 7-5 at Kobe and fell to the third place.
	   Koichi Oshima hit a winning three-run home run in the four-run
ninth inning for the BlueWave. Oshima has five homers this season.
	   The Lions are .024 percentage points ahead of the Buffaloes, who
suffered their sixth straight defeat.
	   The Lions' scheduled game with the Chiba Lotte Marines at Seibu
Dome was rained out.

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Americans see pigs as dirty, greedy slobs, but
in China, the pig is respected for its usefulness.
	   To artist Xu Bing, the American disdain for pigs is a metaphor
for people's tendency to make instant judgments about one another,
instead of looking beneath the surface at hidden qualities.
	   He expresses that idea through his exhibit, ``Xu Bing _ Cultural
Animal,'' at the Wood Street Galleries in downtown Pittsburgh, in
which he displays three black-and-white Hampshire piglets wearing
panda masks.
	   Pigs have many good qualities and in rural China many households
have at least one pig which is given scraps of food that would
otherwise be wasted. When the pig is large enough, it is killed or
sold.
	   Pigs are intelligent animals, says Xu, a New Yorker. ``They are
really smart, they are really cute and they are really sensitive.
Each pig has a different personality.''
	   Murray Horne, the museum's curator, explained that Xu chose the
panda disguise because in the West the panda has a cuddly, positive
image, unlike the pig.
	   The fake-fur masks leave eyes and snouts free, and the pigs were
able to eat, investigate a worker cleaning their cage and walk to
the edge of the cage to be patted. Their floor was covered with
pine shavings and topsoil, and rocks and bamboo were placed in
their cage.
	   Bernie Wilke, a member of Animal Advocates, said he hadn't seen
the exhibit and couldn't say whether the ``Panda Zoo'' portion of
Xu's show used animals ethically. However, confining any animal
runs counter to its interests, he said.
	   ``It would seem that animals would like to be free and forage
for their own food,'' Wilke said.
	   The artist lives in New York and has lectured at Carnegie Mellon
University, while the pigs come Avondale, Westmoreland County.
	   Spectators' reactions varied.
	   ``It doesn't seem to be anything very specific. Everyone here is
just talking it out,'' said Richard Pell, 22, an art student.
``He's not preaching, he's just stirring the pot.''
	   ``I'm not sure what's going on,'' said Julie McAfee, 37, an
artist from Wilkinsburg, a suburb of Pittsburgh. ``I'm looking
forward to understanding more of what is being said.''
	   ``The environment creates a situation of interaction but
separation,'' said art student Thad Kellstadt, 21. ``It also poses
a question and possibly makes a joke or social commentary.''

Dissident who tried to form opposition party released
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A former Tiananmen Square student leader who
recently tried to form an opposition party was released Sunday
after more than seven weeks in detention.
	   Police allowed Wang Youcai to return home, but said he could not
leave his home without their permission, the Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said in a statement.
	   Wang and two other activists announced the formation of the
China Democracy Party on June 25, the day U.S. President Bill
Clinton arrived on a visit, to challenge the ruling Communist
Party's monopoly on power. In mid-July, a week after Clinton's
departure, Chinese police detained Wang and 11 others in connection
with the party.
	   The others were released, but Wang was charged with subversion,
a crime China has used in the past three years to prosecute
high-profile dissidents.
	   The Hong Kong-based human rights center noted Wang was released
a week before the scheduled visit of U.N. Human Commissioner Mary
Robinson. But it argued the most important reason for Wang's
release was pressure on the government from other dissidents who
wrote letters, went on hunger strikes and tried to apply for
permission to hold demonstrations on his behalf.
	   In 1989, after the military quelled the democracy demonstrations
in Tiananmen Square, Wang was on the list of 21 most-wanted student
leaders. He was caught and sentenced to prison, but released early
in late 1991.

More crosses, Mass near Auschwitz defy Polish church

<TEXT>
	   OSWIECIM, Poland (AP) _ With grunts and anti-Semitic comments,
Polish nationalists planted two more crosses next door to the
Auschwitz death camp Sunday to defy their church leaders.
	   A priest from a Roman Catholic splinter group then celebrated
Mass and blessed the more than 150 smaller crosses standing near a
larger cross in a field bordering Auschwitz.
	   About 200 worshipers applauded the Rev. Karl Stehlin of the
Society of St. Pius X when he criticized Polish bishops, who have
refused to bless the smaller crosses and called for their removal.
	   ``Those who should be the first to defend the cross are on the
opposite side of the barricade.'' Stehlin said.
	   The crosses set up in the past month are a religious and
political issue in Poland, drawing protests from Jewish groups
around the world and serving as a rallying point for some Polish
nationalists.
	   They stand on three sides of an eight-meter (26-foot) brown,
wooden cross erected in 1988 by Carmelite nuns on the site where
152 Poles were killed by the Nazis in 1941.
	   The large cross was used in a 1979 Mass celebrated by
Polish-born Pope John Paul II at Birkenau, the sister camp to
Auschwitz three kilometers (1.8 miles) down the road, and its top
can be seen from inside Auschwitz.
	   Jewish groups complain the papal cross disturbs the memory of
the more than 1 million Jews killed at Auschwitz and Birkenau and
want it removed.
	   Poles also consider Auschwitz a symbol of Polish suffering under
the Nazis and they want the papal cross to stay. Fearful that the
government would cave in to Jewish demands and move the papal
cross, Polish nationalists have put up the smaller crosses to try
to protect it.
	   Church leaders including Cardinal Jozef Glemp and the Council of
the Episcopate, the highest church body, last week called the
smaller crosses a political provocation and said they should be
removed.
	   But more crosses have gone up since then, including the two
four-meter (13-foot) wooden ones planted Sunday. One man took off
his suit coat to dig a hole, and then four others joined him in
picking up the second cross and, grunting and struggling, placing
it in.
	   As they worked, they complained that Jews were trying to tell
Poland where to put crosses and controlled the government and the
church. None of the five would give their names.
	   During Stehlin's homily, he attacked the Polish church hierarchy
for failing to respond to the needs of its faithful.
	   ``The church authorities say that we must look at the world,''
he said of the bishop's statement issued Tuesday. ``There must be
peace on the earth and human dignity must be respected. Those words
were said for the first time by freemasons, the biggest enemies of
the church. Instead of God, the human being is now in the center.''
	   The Society of St. Pius X is an international order started by
French-born Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who was excommunicated in
1988 for defying liberal reforms of the 1962-65 Vatican Council.
	   Stehlin, who is German, performed the Mass in Latin and
delivered the homily in Polish. He said afterward he blessed the
crosses because Catholic faithful wanted him to.
	   ``These people are crying because they are fed up, they are
being mistreated,'' he said. Asked about the anti-Semitism of some
of those erecting the crosses, he said: ``I bless a cross, I don't
bless an opinion.''
	   Some people followed Stehlin around the field as he sprinkled
holy water on the crosses, one of which was set up by a Polish
skinhead group and sported Polish and German banners.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP ) _ A pro-Albanian human rights group
disputed Sunday Serbian allegations that Kosovo Albanian guerrillas
had killed and burned 22 Serbs in the embattled southern Kosovo
province.
	   The Board for Protection of Human Rights and Freedoms, based in
Kosovo's capital Pristina, demanded an independent investigation to
determine if recently found human remains were those of Kosovo
Serbs.
	   Serbian police said Saturday they had discovered a crematory in
southern Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians allegedly had burned the
bodies of at least 22 Serb civilians.
	   They said the furnace, allegedly used to destroy the bodies of
civilians killed by the rebels, was found in the village of Klecka,
recently retaken by government forces.
	   The statement, carried by the official Tanjug news agency, was
the latest in a series of claims of brutality and atrocities by
both sides.
	   In Pristina, the pro-Albanian rights group said Sunday: ``The
monstrous crime was blamed on members of the Kosovo Liberation army
without first determining the truth first by unbiased, competent
experts.''
	   It hinted the remains might have been of Kosovo Albanians killed
elsewhere in the province and planted as false evidence.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have waged a months-long
offensive to crush the KLA, which is spearheading the independence
fight of Kosovo's Albanian majority. Kosovo is a province of
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides, and more than
260,000 have been rendered homeless by the fighting which erupted
in Kosovo in March this year between government forces and the KLA.
	   Both Serb and Albanian sources reported Sunday a shootout in the
village of Susica, northwestern Kosovo, where eight ethnic
Albanians were killed on Saturday.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center said Serbian police
in armored vehicles surrounded several houses of the Salihaj
family, issuing an ultimatum for all to surrender.
	   Women and children left, but the men remained, and in an ensuing
battle eight of the ethnic Albanians died and one was arrested.
Bodies of the killed were allegedly mutilated.
	   A terse police version of the same incident, carried by the
official Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency, said police were
engaged in fighting in Susica while searching for a ``terrorist
group,'' led by Saban Salihaj, 42, wanted in the slaying of three
Serbian policemen in June.
	   On Saturday, the Red Cross evacuated 13 women and children, who
were wounded Thursday by fierce shelling, from a crowded refugee
village to Pristina.
	   The victims were among an estimated 50,000 ethnic Albanians near
Senik village in southwestern Kosovo, where they fled after their
own communities were shelled by Yugoslav army tanks.
	   In Pristina, some of the evacuees from around Senik said the
attack Thursday targeted only civilians.
	   ``The shelling began at seven in the morning,'' said one of the
victims, Xhemile Zulfaj, as she lay shivering on the floor of the
Red Cross truck, her 2-year-old boy beside her. ``Thirteen of us
were in our house. A shell exploded, and we ran outside, screaming.
One of us died.''
	   Maggie Bryson of the International Red Cross, who helped
evacuate the 13, said conditions around Senik were deplorable.
	   With the onset of cold weather, the estimated 50,000 refugees
camped out in the open in isolated areas were facing an
``absolutely dreadful'' situation, she said.
	   ``Without shelter, people cannot survive,'' she said.
	   Serbian police and Yugoslav army troops have purged KLA fighters
from much of the at least 30 percent of Kosovo territory the rebels
once controlled.

Claydon wins first tour title at BMW Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ England's Russell Claydon captured the
first tour title of his 10-year-career Sunday, shaking off several
players at the BMW International Open with a long 17th hole birdie.
	   Claydon, who had to settle for second seven times, fired a final
day four-under-par 68 to win the dlrs 1.39 million event by a
stroke at 18-under 270.
	   ``I'm really pleased,'' said Claydon. ``I think I got the right
breaks at the right time and capitalized on them.''
	   England's Jamie Spence, with a final round 66, grabbed second
with 271, followed by Germany's Thomas Goegele at 16-under 272.
	   Claydon's win also denied Bernhard Langer the only title he's
failed to capture in Germany. The two-time Masters champion had won
10 titles and swept all three other European tour events held in
his homeland.
	   After sharing the third round lead with Claydon and fighting for
the lead most of the day, Langer finished three strokes back at
273, along with Argentina's Angel Cabrera. He shot a final round
68.
	   But Claydon, who had grabbed a stroke lead, didn't shake off the
field until a 8-meter (25 feet) putt on the 17th hole dropped in,
putting him ahead by two strokes.
	   ``I didn't play the last five holes well _ the putts just didn't
fall,'' said Langer, who had par on the holes while Claydon bolted
into the lead.
	   Spence, firing a 66, mounted the final challenge to Claydon,
chopping his lead back to a single stroke with a birdie on the 18th
hole.
	   But Claydon, playing it safe, made par in his final hole. He
almost added another birdie, but his putt hung on the lip of the
cup.

Mahathir urges self-reliance in independence day address
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
marked Malaysia's 41st independence celebration on a defiant note
Sunday, saying the country should not depend on foreign help to
overcome its current economic woes.
	   ``Outsiders never wish to see Malaysia recover by continuously
attacking the country's currency and the stock market whenever the
government initiate measures to revive the nation's economy,'' he
said in a nationally televised address.
	   Mahathir also lashed out at ``outsiders'' who wanted Malaysia to
do away with the Internal Security Act which allows detention
without trial.
	   ``Do they wish to see our national stabillity adversely affected
by racial riots?'' he said.
	   Mahathir said Malaysia had been able to resist speculative
attacks on its currency because the country's development was based
on its own efforts and policies.
	   Malaysia has been hit hard by the stubborn economic turmoil in
Southeast Asia. The central bank said last week that the country
has fallen into full-blown recession after its second quarter gross
domestic product contracted by 6.8 percent.

Official: rebels withdraw from key Congo port town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with cabinet director accusing rebels of torching port,
looting Matadi; loyalists capture Inga dam; UPDATES with Kabila in
Zimbabwe, ADDS quotes. No pickup.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The government on Sunday accused
retreating rebel forces of looting and setting ablaze Congo's only
major port town of Matadi.
	   Angolan forces fighting on behalf of President Laurent Kabila
have captured Matadi, the only major shipping facility on the Congo
River serving inland southwestern Congo, but not before withdrawing
rebels on Saturday set fire to the port.
	   ``This is a signal of what would come if their plan to take
Kinshasa succeeds,'' Kabila's cabinet director Abdoulaye Yerodia
told reporters.
	   Matadi was the last major town in southwestern Congo controlled
by a rebel coalition that won a string of stunning successes early
in the month-old uprising.
	   With the help of allied Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian forces,
Kabila's loyalist troops have regained ground nearly as quickly as
it was lost. The rebels are widely believed to be backed by
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, although both countries have denied
involvement.
	   The rebels, who accuse Kabila of tribalism and money-grabbing,
remain in control of several major cities in Congo's eastern
regions.
	   Yerodia said a key power dam at the town Inga, southwest of
Kinshasa had been recaptured by Congo's allies, although
electricity to the capital had not yet been restored.
	   ``This is due to a technical fault,'' Deputy Interior Minister
Faustin Munene said in a state radio broadcast.
	   Rebel leader Jean-Pierre Ondekane on Saturday remained defiant,
telling reporters in the eastern stronghold of Goma that his forces
were in control of an airbase at Matadi, about 350 kilometers (215
miles) southwest of Kinshasa.
	   ``They say the war is over but I say the war in not finished,''
Ondekane. ``We're in Kinshasa fighting. The situation is going
well.''
	   Kabila flew Sunday to Zimbabwe, where he was expected to thank
the country for sending troops that have played a key role in
impeding the rebels, including an advance last week on Kinshasa's
airport.
	   Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe met Kabila at the airport,
officials said.
	   Congo's capital was quiet Sunday morning a night after gunfire
rattled the city's west side. Firefights west of the downtown area
broke out shortly before a nightly curfew went into effect at 6
p.m.
	   Government, Angolan and Zimbabwean forces continued to search
door-to-door for suspected insurgent fighters who last week tried
to stage an assault on Kinshasa.
	   Days of fierce fighting took a heavy toll in the capital's
eastern Kingasani and Masina districts, where bodies littered the
streets, Health Minister Jean-Baptist Sondgi said.
	   Fighting in parts of Kinshasa also triggered days of
execution-style killings, lynchings and revenge attacks against
suspected rebels.
	   Responding to complaints from foreign ambassadors in Kinshasa,
Yerodia defended his military's conduct.
	   ``The reality of this situation is that the front is
everywhere,'' he said. ``The aggressors are hiding in houses and
back alleys in all quarters. If there are fronts everywhere in
Kinshasa, there is war everywhere.''
	   The charred corpses of suspected rebels lie along some streets
in downtown Kinshasa.
	   Officials say hundreds and perhaps thousands of rebel fighters
have surrendered or been killed just in the past few days of
fighting.
	   Kabila won the support of several neighboring countries after
insisting the Congolese rebellion was in fact an invasion by
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Rwanda has denied its involvement in the conflict, but on
Saturday Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana reiterated
warnings his government will send troops into Congo if peace
efforts fail.
	   Rwanda will have ``no choice but to intervene militarily to
rescue Rwandese ... as well as some Congolese ... who do not
support the killings,'' Gasana told reporters at a Nonaligned
Movement summit in South Africa.
	   Fifty-one heads of state are scheduled to attend the summit, and
participants are expected to discuss the Congo war. Kabila has
chosen to send his foreign minister Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe,
summit organizers said.
	   It was unclear whether Congolese rebels would be attending.

Mandela meets with Libyan minister on Lockerbie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Libya's Foreign Minister Omar
Montasser met Sunday with President Nelson Mandela to discuss
proposed Lockerbie trial issues, the South African Press
Association reported.
	   Montasser, who is heading the Libyan delegation to the
Nonaligned Movement summit in Durban, flew Sunday morning to Cape
Town for the meeting, a Mandela aide told SAPA. The aide was not
identified.
	   Libya has accepted a joint U.S.-British proposal to hold the
trial of two Libyan suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in
a neutral venue of the Netherlands. The plane exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people
	   But it has made no firm commitment to turn over the pair.
	   The proposal provides for the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ to be tried in the
Netherlands by a panel of three Scottish judges according to
Scottish law.
	   Last Friday, the Security Council unanimously agreed to suspend
sanctions against Tripoli once it turns over the two suspects,
calling on Libya to honor its pledges.
	   Mandela last year played a key role in convincing the United
States and Britain to support a neutral venue for the trial and
relayed the proposal to Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
	   SAPA said the Libyan delegation was seeking greater clarity on
such issues as where the two men would serve a sentence if found
guilty and how witnesses would be used at the trial.

Kohl's coalition partner squares off against Greens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Similar report moved Saturday on these lines. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The perennial kingmakers in German
politics, the Free Democrats, called for deep tax cuts this weekend
in their campaign to keep a foothold in the national government.
	   The Free Democrats, a tiny junior party in Kohl's conservative
coalition since defecting from the main opposition Social Democrats
in 1982, hope to recrown Kohl for a record fifth term after Sept.
27 elections.
	   But the staunch free marketeers have been losing ground steadily
in recent years, and Kohl's Christian Democrats are in a tough race
with the left-leaning Social Democrats.
	   The Social Democrats are expected to try to form a national
coalition with the environmentalist Greens, their junior partner in
several state governments.
	   At a gathering Saturday in Bonn to launch their final phase of
campaigning, the Free Democrats portrayed the Greens as their main
adversary and called them anti-technology and backward-looking.
	   ``If it were up to the Greens, a mobile telephone still would be
two cans connected by a cord,'' Free Democrats general-secretary
Guido Westerwelle said.
	   The Free Democrats also called for across-the-board tax cuts
that would save taxpayers up to 30 billion marks (dlrs 17 billion)
a year.
	   The Free Democrats are fiscally conservative like the rest of
Kohl's coalition, but tend to overlap more with the left-leaning
Greens on social issues like immigration and illegal drugs.
	   Both of the minor parties could be sidelined under a scenario
drawing increased discussion among the two major parties: the
Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats could team up
together.
	   Social Democratic chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder
indicates he'd consider the idea. Kohl and other coalition members
have dismissed Schroeder's stance as a ruse to assure middle-class
voters he is a business-friendly centrist, and that his real
intention is having the Social Democrats head a leftist government.
	   But a key member of Kohl's party, Saxony state governor Kurt
Biedenkopf, was quoted as saying he thought such a ``grand
coalition'' was not improbable.
	   ``Many voters think it might be best if the two big parties did
things together,'' Biedenkopf said in an interview for Monday's Der
Spiegel magazine.

U.S. secretary of state and Croatian president disagree over
</HEADLINE>
Bosnia &QL; 
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright acknowledged Sunday that Croatia and the United States
disagree over Croatia's relations with Croats in neighboring
Bosnia.
	   ``Where we have a disagreement, I think, is in the relationship
of Croatia to Bosnian Croats,'' Albright said at a joint press
conference with President Franjo Tudjman.
	   Albright arrived here late Saturday to try to accelerate
democracy in a nation affected by ethnic war in neighboring Bosnia,
which has a sizable ethnic Croatian population, and Tudjman's
hard-line rule.
	   Tudjman rules with a firm hand, and his government is frequently
criticized for its treatment of minorities and the media.
	   ``We believe that it's very important for the Bosnian Croats to
be able to act independently,'' she said, referring to the uphill
U.S.-led effort to establish a diversified, peaceful state from
often clashing communities in Bosnia.
	   Later Sunday, Albright traveled to Bosnia to support the
national elections that will be held in two weeks and to spur
return of Serb refugees.
	   She met with American members of NATO's stabilization force and
local officials. She also flew by helicopter to Bijeljina, a town
in the Bosnian Serb half of Bosnia for meetings with officials
there.
	   In Zagreb, Tudjman said the Bosnia issue ``is the main problem
in cooperation between the United States and Croatia.''
	   While saying that Croatia supports the 1995 peace agreement that
ended a 3 1/2-year war in Bosnia, Tudjman argued that his
government should, according to its constitution, take care of its
compatriots in Bosnia, ``who in many ways feel imperiled.''
	   The agreeement, reached near Dayton, Ohio, set up separate
republics in Bosnia for Serbs, who had fought the mostly Muslim
government in Sarajevo, and for a combination of Muslims and
Croats.
	   Tudjman also complained Sunday that Bosnian Serbs have the right
to their insignia and state-like institutions, ``while Croats are
deprived of using their national symbols.''
	   Albright pledged to speed up the return of Serbs, who fled en
masse when the government recaptured areas they seized in 1991.
	   She said that Croatia made some progress, but emphasized that
the United States still has ``important concerns,'' which include
the state of democracy in Croatia.
	   ``We urge political reforms and respect for free media,'' she
said.
	   In an attempt to nudge democracy in this young former-Yugoslav
state, Albright also met leaders of the six strongest opposition
parties and representatives of independent media.
	   Albright also met Zagreb Archbishop Josip Bozanic, Croatia's
Roman Catholic prelate.
	   Neither gave any statement, but that meeting appeared to boost
the 49-year-old Bozanic, who has been highly critical of some of
the government's moves ever since he was appointed by the Vatican
last October.

Somali faction leader says reconciliation conference set
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopa (AP) _ Somali faction leader Hussein
Mohammed Aidid said Sunday that a long-awaited national
reconciliation conference would be held in January.
	   Aidid, who held talks over the weekend with Ethiopian officials,
said the venue was still under consideration, but that the
gathering would be in either the central Somali city of Baidoa,
which he controls, or in Mogadishu, the capital.
	   Late last year, 24 Somali faction leaders, including Aidid,
agreed to form a transition government and to hold a national
reconciliation conference, which has now been postponed three
times.
	   Somalia has had no central government since 1991, when warlords
Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Mohamed Farah Aidid joined forces to oust
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. They later turned on each other, and
the country dissolved into warring fiefdoms of clan-based factions.
	   After weekend talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
and other officials, Aidid also said he had pledged that his
movement would not allow any terrorist group to operate from
Somalia against Ethiopia.
	   That was in apparent reference to the fundamentalist Muslim
group Al-Itihad Al-Islam, which Ethiopia says was behind a spate of
hotel bombings in Ethiopian cities in the last 18 months.
	   Aidid has been a major critic of the Ethiopian government's
cross-border attacks against the group's suspected bases and
training camps in Somalia.
	   Al-Itihad Al-Islam has fought since 1992 for the unification of
the southeastern Ethiopian Ogaden region with Somalia. Ogaden is
populated by ethnic Somalis.
	   With the agreement to curtail guerrilla operations from his
territory, Aidid told a news conference that ``a new page'' has
been turned in relations with the Ethiopian government. He said his
faction would soon open a liaison office in the Ethiopian capital.

Iraq complains of delays in receiving spare parts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Oil production is in ``critical condition''
because of delays in receiving spare parts, the official Iraqi News
Agency said Sunday.
	   It also said Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid left for
India Sunday for talks on ways to boost trade and oil sales. It
gave no details.
	   INA quoted an unnamed official at the Oil Ministry as saying
that oil production and export systems are in a ``critical
condition'' and are operating without backup because of delays in
receiving spare parts, bought under the the U.N-approved
oil-for-food deal.
	   ``The delay in the arrival of the spare parts and the necessary
material needed for production at the Iraqi oil installations will
definitely lead to a drop in production and exports because Iraq
will not be able to do any emergency repair work in its oil
installations,'' INA said.
	   The official said Iraq had signed 11 contracts for spare arts
worth dlrs 100 million but that the U.N. sanctions committee had
only approved seven contracts so far and had suspended five others.
Spare parts received so far by Iraq amounted to only dlrs 2.5
million of the value of the contracts, the official was quoted as
saying.
	   ``We are still waiting for the supplies to arrive, although the
letters of credit to pay for these contracts have already been
opened, using surplus money from the previous phases,'' the
official said.
	   Under the U.N. sanctions imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, a U.N. committee must approve all contracts Iraq signs
with foreign companies before shipments are allowed into the
country.
	   The oil-for-food deal, implemented in Dec. 1996, allows Iraq to
skirt the sanctions and sell limited amounts of oil to buy food and
medicine.

<TEXT>
	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ Britain's Damon Hill won a
tumultuous Belgian Grand Prix Sunday, surviving a rainstorm that
caused one of the biggest pile-ups in Formula One history and saw
hotheaded Michael Schumacher crash out with victory beckoning.
	   World standings leader Mika Hakkinen spun out on the first
hairpin and Schumacher seemed poised to take over the championship
lead until he crashed into the back of Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes
teammate David Coulthard, blinded by a sheet of spray.
	   Hill, the 1996 world champion, won his first Grand Prix in two
seasons and gave the Jordan team its first ever victory. It was
Hill's third win on Formula One's most challenging circuit. Ralf
Schumacher made it an incredible one-two finish for Jordan-Mugen
Honda, which had known a difficult start to the season.
	   Veteran Jean Alesi drove his Sauber-Petronas into third place.
	   The Grand Prix turned into one of the most spectacular ever as
of the first initial lap, when a dozen of the 22 cars slammed into
each other in the downhill straight just after the opening La
Source hairpin. Coulthard was in third position when his car
suddenly veered into the protective wall and bounced back onto the
track.
	   Blinded by spray coming off the leading cars, driver after
driver crashed into a wall of wrecks, tires and debris. Amazingly,
all drivers were able to walk away from the smoke and twisted
metal.
	   The race resumed nearly one hour later and Hakkinen started slow
off pole position and already had Schumacher breathing down his
neck at La Source. The Finn could not hold his line on the hairpin
and, with Schumacher slightly touching his car, he spun. Johnny
Herbert slammed into the McLaren and Hakkinen's race was over after
about 10 seconds.
	   Schumacher moved past early leader Hill and with brilliant
wet-weather driving, he dominated until the 25th lap when he
prepared to lap Coulthard. The German miscalculated Coulthard's
speed and in near-invisbility, he slammed into the back the
McLaren, and lost his right frontwheel and any chance of victory.
	   Both drivers slumped to the pits and Schumacher immediately went
over the McLaren stand to challenge Coulthard, accusing him of
reckless driving. Schumacher had to be restrained before he could
reach the Scot.
	   With both Hakkinen and Schumacher out of the race, the Finn held
on to his 77-70 edge in the standings with only three races
remaining on the calendar.
	   With the championship leaders back in the pits, this season's
lesser gods took over and didn't disappoint. With four laps to go,
Hill, Ralf Schumacher and Alesi were within three seconds of each
other the thrilling race captivated the tens of thousands of fans
up to the end.

	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ Britain's Damon Hill won a
tumultuous Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday, surviving a rainstorm that
caused one of the biggest pile-ups in Formula One history and saw
hotheaded Michael Schumacher crash out with victory beckoning.
	   World standings leader Mika Hakkinen spun out on the first
hairpin and Schumacher seemed poised to take over the championship
lead until he crashed into the back of Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes
teammate David Coulthard, blinded by a sheet of spray.
	   Hill, the 1996 world champion, won his first Grand Prix in two
seasons and gave the Jordan team its first ever victory. It was
Hill's third win on Formula One's most challenging circuit. Ralf
Schumacher made it an incredible one-two finish for Jordan-Mugen
Honda, which had a difficult start to the season.
	   Veteran Jean Alesi drove his Sauber-Petronas into third place.
	   The Grand Prix turned into one of the most spectacular ever as
of the first initial lap, when a dozen of the 22 cars slammed into
each other in the downhill straight just after the opening La
Source hairpin. Coulthard was in third position when his car veered
into the protective wall and bounced back onto the track.
	   Blinded by spray coming off the leading cars, driver after
driver crashed into a wall of wrecks, tires and debris. Amazingly,
all drivers were able to walk away from the smoke and twisted
metal.
	   The race resumed nearly an hour later and Hakkinen started slow
off pole position and already had Schumacher breathing down his
neck at La Source. The Finn could not hold his line on the hairpin
and, with Schumacher slightly touching his car, he spun. Johnny
Herbert slammed into the McLaren and Hakkinen's race was over after
about 10 seconds.
	   Schumacher moved past early leader Hill and with brilliant
wet-weather driving, he dominated until the 25th lap when he
prepared to lap Coulthard. The German miscalculated Coulthard's
speed and in near-invisibility, he slammed into the back the
McLaren, and lost his right front wheel and any chance of victory.
	   Both drivers slumped to the pits and Schumacher immediately went
over the McLaren stand to challenge Coulthard, accusing him of
reckless driving. Schumacher had to be restrained before he could
reach the Scot.
	   With both Hakkinen and Schumacher out of the race, the Finn held
on to his 77-70 edge in the standings with only three races
remaining on the calendar.
	   With the championship leaders back in the pits, this season's
lesser gods took over and didn't disappoint. With four laps to go,
Hill, Ralf Schumacher and Alesi were within three seconds of each
other the thrilling race captivated the tens of thousands of fans
up to the end.

Brack wins third straight IRL race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMPTON, Georgia (AP) _ It took him a while to get rolling, but
Kenny Brack was there at the end of the inaugural Atlanta 500
Classic, becoming the first Pep Boys Indy Racing League driver to
win three straight races.
	   Brack, a 30-year-old Swede, failed to win in his first 13 IRL
races and hasn't lost since, giving car-owner A.J. Foyt victories
at Charlotte, Pikes Peak and now Atlanta Motor Speedway.
	   Saturday night's win, combined with Scott Sharp's failure to
finish because of a gearbox problem midway through the race, moved
Brack into the season points lead with only two of 11 races
remaining.
	   ``Amazing,'' Brack said. ``On the last yellow, we were not sure
if we should go for the lead or stay in third for the points. I
guess I'm not that kind of driver.''
	   He was third when the green flag came out on lap 185 for the
last restart, but Brack quickly passed Davey Hamilton for second
and then chased down leader Jeff Ward.
	   Brack led just 17 of the 208 laps on the 1.54-mile (2.5
kilometer) oval, but took the lead for good on lap 195 when he
drove his Dallara-Aurora race car past Ward's G Force-Aurora in the
first turn and pulled away.
	   Hamilton also drove past Ward on lap 195 and held onto second,
finishing .944 seconds _ about 10 car-lengths _ behind the winner.
	   ``Right now, they're on a roll,'' Hamilton said of Brack's team.
``He won one and got confident. Once you get that first one,
sometimes it's easy. Their team is jelling real good and they're on
a mission right now.''
	   Indianapolis 500 winner Eddie Cheever held off Scott Goodyear
for third, followed by Tony Stewart, the fading Ward, who had
handling problems at the end, and Mark Dismore, the last driver on
the lead lap.
	   The race, the first major event held under the lights at
Atlanta, drew an estimated 40,000 spectators on a warm humid night.
They saw a fast race punctuated by a series of crashes and periods
of spectacular racing at speeds topping 220 mph (354 kph).
	   The race was caution-free until a bank of lights went out on lap
54. After six laps, IRL officials determined the section of
darkened track posed no threat to the drivers and the green flag
came back out. Eventually, the lights came back on.
	   Greg Ray, who started 16th and quickly drove into contention,
moving all the way to third by lap 18, began a long caution period
when he ran over debris and exploded a tire, spinning in turn three
and backing into the wall.
	   During the ensuing caution, as everyone was making scheduled pit
stops, John Paul Jr., the only driver in the lineup who had
previously raced an Indy-car here _ finishing third in 1983 in a
CART event _ also hit the wall.
	   Paul had just left the pits and was putting on the power to get
back up to speed when his car veered to the right and slammed into
the wall just past the exit of turn three.
	   Stephan Gregoire, who had finished fourth, eighth and fifth in
his last three starts, was the next crash victim, losing control
and hitting the wall on lap 133 and hitting the third-turn wall.
The Frenchman was sixth at the time.
	   The most spectacular incident of the night came on lap 170 when
Billy Boat, who had just regained a lost lap and was running
seventh just behind the leaders, tried to pass the lapped car of
Marco Greco. Greco's car was enveloped in flames, but the driver
scrambled to safety without injury.
	   Those two banged together twice, sending both into the wall on
the back straightaway. Robby Unser, who earlier lost several laps
after his car caught on fire in the pits, and rookie Steve Knapp
got involved. Both hit the wall, with Knapp going upside down and
Unser nearly upside down as trailing cars dodged and darted to
avoid them. Knapp was placed on a stretcher for the short trip to
the infield medical center, but was released after being checked
out.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algerian President Liamine Zeroual plans
to argue for an international convention on fighting terrorism when
he attends this week's Nonaligned Movement summit in South Africa,
diplomats say.
	   The Algerian leader, fighting a bloody insurgency at home, left
Sunday on an African trip that will take him to Mozambique, South
Africa and Namibia.
	   Zeroual was to spend two days in Maputo, Mozambique at the
invitation of President Joaquim Chissano. Then he heads to Durban
for the 12th summit of the Nonaligned Movement.
	   There, he plans to present new ideas for an accord on fighting
terror, diplomats in Algiers said on condition of anonymity.
	   Massacres and bombings during Algeria's 6-year-old Islamic
insurgency have left some 75,000 people dead.
	   Zeroual, accompanied by his foreign minister, Ahmed Attaf, will
end his African trip with a three-day visit to Namibia.

	   PARIS (AP) _ As they have every day for a year, people gathered
Sunday at the Pont de l'Alma, where Princess Diana met her death in
a high-speed car crash last August.
	   More police than usual were on hand to prevent people from
walking into the traffic tunnel and perhaps causing an accident.
	   But the crowd of 150-200 people, largely tourists, mostly
gathered around a makeshift memorial and examined notes and

Czech Republic to lose economic partner if it approves station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - The Czech Republic will lose a potential
economic partner if it allows Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to
broadcast to Iraq from its territory, a newspaper said Sunday.
	   The new Czech Social Democratic government has agreed to allow
the U.S.-run programs to broadcast to Iran, but said the United
States must make an official request to target the broadcast at
Iraq.
	   Despite the previous government's favorable stance, Prague's new
government fears the station might become a target for terrorist
attacks.
	   ``The Czech Republic's hesitation is understandable,'' said an
editorial in Al-Thawra, the daily newspaper of the ruling Baath
party.
	   ``If it agrees to the American request (to broadcast to Iraq),
it will erect a giant wall between it and Iraq, and maybe between
it and the Arabs and will negatively affect relations between the
two countries,'' said the paper.
	   ``At any rate, there is no need for the Czech Republic to get
involved in any antagonistic action toward (Iraq)... a country from
which it can benefit a great deal economically and politically.''
	   In May, U.S. legislators approved the station's new plans to
beam to Iraq and Iran.
	   The Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty began transmissions from
Munich, Germany in 1951 with uncensored news to Communist countries
during the Cold War. The station moved to Prague in 1995, following
Communism's collapse.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Heavy rains brought on by an approaching typhoon
flooded homes and sent waters gushing from streams in northeastern
Japan Sunday, killing at least one person and leaving two missing.
	   The downpour caused by Typhoon Rex has claimed at least 14 lives
and injured 40 since Thursday. Among the dead were five people who
were buried in a mudslide in Fukushima prefectures, 240 kilometers
(150 miles) northeast of Tokyo. Five people were still missing.
	   On Sunday, 73-year-old woman died after being buried under a
landslide while clearing the debris from an earlier landslide
behind her home in Fukushima, police said.
	   Kyodo News said that another person was found dead in Ibaraki
Prefecture, north of Tokyo, but police could not confirm the
report.
	   Casualties and damage had spread to at least 22 prefectures
(states), as of 5 p.m. Sunday. About 10,000 people were evacuted
from their homes Sunday in Shizuoka Prefecture, west of Tokyo.
	   A 58-year-old woman went missing Sunday after a bulging river
swallowed her in Iwate Prefecture (state), 460 kilometers (290
miles) north of Tokyo.
	   And in Ashikaga, northwest of Tokyo, a 26-year-old man fell into
a swollen irrigation channel and has not been found.
	   Rescue workers digging in mud have been unable to find the three
people who were swept downstream after a river burst Thursday in
Tochigi, 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Tokyo, they said.
	   More than 10,000 homes have been flooded, destroyed or partly
destroyed, and the number of mudslides climbed Sunday to 715 from
575 Saturday, police said.
	   In Tochigi prefecture, about 450 cows drowned or went missing as
cow sheds were washed away, causing 234 million yen (dlrs 1.6
million) in damage, said Toshihiro Yoshizawa, a spokesman of the
Tochigi prefectural government.
	   The Central Meteorogical Agency said that Rex, packing winds of
up to 126 kph (80 mph), was located about 650 kilometers (390
miles) south of Tokyo as of 6 p.m. (0900gmt) Sunday. Rex was moving
toward north-northeast at a speed of 10 kilometers (6 miles) per
hour, it said.
	   Rains were likely to continue for the next two or three days
because Rex was moving so slowly. It could come near the eastern
Japanese coast by Monday night, the agency said.
	   Heavy rain and flood warnings were issued Sunday throughout
regions in northeastern Japan, including Tokyo and Gunma, Ibaraki,
Tochigi and Saitama prefectures.
	   Rainfall was expected to hit as high as 60 millimeters (2.5
inches) per hour in some areas, the agency said.
	   Nationwide TV news showed cars swimming through currents
swerving through residential streets.
	   Bullet trains and several other lines throughout northern Japan
and areas near Tokyo were disrupted, with stops or slow-downs, a
railway spokesman said.

U.S. Navy plane may have found runaway weather balloon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Icelandic officials saying U.S. Navy
believes they've spotted runaway balloon but can't confirm it &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A U.S. Navy plane believes it spotted a runaway
weather balloon Sunday about halfway from Iceland to the North
Pole.
	   But the P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft developed a propeller
leak and had to return to the NATO base in Keflavik, on Iceland's
southwest coast, before it could confirm the discovery, said Halli
Sigurdsson, deputy director of Air Traffic Services in Iceland.
	   ``We are fairly optimistic the balloon has been found,'' he told
The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ``The U.S. military
is launching another P-3 and it is going to go to the area and
confirm that the balloon is there.''
	   The 100-meter-high (110-yard-high) balloon, which was being
tracked by the U.S. military in Iceland, disappeared off radar
screens late Saturday night about 200 miles (320 kms) north of the
Arctic Circle. The Navy launched a P-3 Sunday morning to try and
find it.
	   Sigurdsson said the Navy believes the errant balloon is now east
of Greenland and north of mainland Norway, about halfway from
Iceland to the North Pole.
	   ``If this is the balloon, it looks like it's heading towards
Spitsbergen,'' a remote Norwegian island on the Arctic Circle off
the country's north coast, he said.
	   The balloon, an unstaffed research station used to observe
weather patterns, can be seen from about 70 kilometers (40 miles)
away. It is not equipped with transponders that emit navigation
signals to alert airliners to its presence.
	   Aircraft from Canada, Britain and the U.S. military in Iceland
had tracked the runaway balloon, and air traffic controllers had
been diverting planes from its path. Sigurdsson said its
disappearance Saturday night was worrying because of the possible
danger to air traffic.
	   Canadian jet fighters on Thursday fired more than 1,000 rounds
into the helium-filled balloon but it remained aloft.
	   On Saturday, when the balloon came close to Iceland, a volcanic
island nation in the North Atlantic just under the Arctic Circle,
the U.S. military picked it up on radar. The U.S. military aircraft
tracking the balloon then landed.
	   ``When the balloon went north of Iceland, the U.S. military lost
it off radar,'' Sigurdsson said. ``At the time, they had no
aircraft flying to follow the balloon.''
	   If the P-3 launched Sunday afternoon confirms the discovery of
the balloon, U.S. military aircraft ``are going to stay with it for
as long as they can to track its position and heading,'' he said.
	   The 25-story balloon, which flattened out would cover five
football fields, was launched before dawn on Monday from Vanscoy,
just outside Saskatoon, in Canada to measure ozone levels over
Canada.
	   The project was a joint effort between the Canadian Space
Agency, Environment Canada, the Center for Research in Earth and
Space Technology, the University of Toronto, York University and
the University of Denver.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government and parliamentary
leaders agreed Sunday to an 18-month truce that would leave Boris
Yeltsin in control and give the administration time to try to end
the country's economic and political crisis.
	   Under the tentative agreement, Communists and their allies
agreed to give swift confirmation to acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and said they would not try to topple the government
for 18 months.
	   In exchange, President Yeltsin will consult lawmakers on Cabinet
appointments and will not dissolve parliament during the same
period, Russian media reported.
	   In a televised interview Sunday evening, Chernomyrdin expressed
optimism that the nation's economic crisis could be overcome.
	   ``We know how to begin and what first steps to take,'' he said.
``We cannot waste time. The country cannot live without a
government.''
	   The agreement comes after nearly a week of uncertainty about who
was in charge of Russia while the economy is in a tailspin. While
Yeltsin would be obliged to consult parliament on key issues, the
agreement appeared to leave him with substantial political power.
	   The agreement would provide a political truce until
parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1999. Under the
Russian Constitution, the parliament has little authority and
opposition leaders had demanded some form of power sharing, but the
pact appeared to stop short of that.
	   Yeltsin was forced to go on national television Friday to
reiterate he would not resign before his term ends in 2000 and
Chernomyrdin followed on Saturday with reassurances that there will
be no return to the Soviet system.
	   ``Maybe we would have liked some sections of the documents to be
tougher,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is speaker of
the State Duma.
	   ``But we must take into consideration that there are seven
factions in the State Duma, there is the president, the government
and the Federation Council,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   The Federation Council is the upper chamber of parliament and
the State Duma, the lower. The Duma is scheduled to meet Monday to
consider Chernomyrdin's appointment, and Alexander Shokhin, the
head of his parliamentary faction predicted he would be approved on
the first vote.
	   Chernomyrdin said Saturday the negotiations on the political
agreement were difficult in part because they are historic.
	   ``This is the first time in six years that we are coming to
agreement on the definition of the problems in which Russia finds
herself,'' he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The agreement was sent to Yeltsin to sign at his country
residence outside of Moscow, said Vladimir Ryzhkov, deputy speaker
of the Duma.
	   Yeltsin spoke by telephone to one of his staunchest allies,
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the two men agreed that the fast
confirmation of a new Cabinet would be a significant factor in
restoring stability in Russia, the presidential press service said.
	   The agreement could yet be derailed by some of the smaller
parties who were still seeking amendments.
	   The Communists want some changes made to the terms of IMF loans
to Russia, said the chairman of their allied Agrarian Party,
Nikolai Kharitonov. They also want Yeltsin to be forced to consult
them on an alternative candidate for prime minister if they reject
Chernomyrdin. Yeltsin now has the authority to dissolve parliament
if they reject his candidate three times.
	   Last week the hard-liners were also seeking a package of
Soviet-style economic measures, such as price and currency
controls, renationalization, and printing more money.
	   But they have said nothing about it since Chernomyrdin vowed in
a scripted TV interview Saturday that there will be no return to
the Soviet system. There was no mention of an economic agreement
after Sunday's negotiations.
	   ``We have already joined the world economy, and there will be no
return to the past,'' Chernomyrdin said, promising to keep the
ruble convertible, shore up the wobbly banking system and protect
depositors.
	   ``The main thing is to make sure people don't suffer,'' he said,
looking straight at the camera. ``For this we should use our power,
and we will use it as much as necessary.''
	   ``You can be calm. You will get your savings,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back as prime minister a week ago
because he hoped the familiar figure would restore confidence in
the government, badly damaged by the ruble's sharp decline.
	   The Russian ruble appeared to gain in street trading Sunday and
exchange points across Moscow were buying U.S. dollars at an
average 8 rubles, down from an average 8.5 the day before. That
would value one ruble at about 12.5 cents, up from 11.76 cents.
	   The average street rate was close to the latest official rate of
7.95 rubles to the dollar _ or 12.57 cents _ set before Russia's
Central Bank suspended dollar sales last week.
	   The crisis has been building all summer as Russia's financial
markets collapsed, hit by the growing global crisis in developing
markets. The economic turmoil forced the government to devalue the
ruble two weeks ago, which triggered a larger crisis of confidence
in Yeltsin's government.

Flash floods in Yemen kill 14, injure 15
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Flash floods have killed 14 people and
injured 15 others in Yemen, a government official said Sunday.
	   The deaths occurred on Friday and Saturday in different parts of
Yemen. At least two of those killed were women who died after they
were struck by lightening, said the official, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   President Ali Abdullah Saleh toured some of the flooded areas in
the suburbs of the capital San`a and offered his condolences to the
families of the victims.
	   According to government estimates, nearly 100 people have died
over the past month from flash floods caused by heavy rains.
	   About 200 people died in floods in 1996 that swept through
several Yemeni provinces, causing damage estimated at dlrs 1.2
billion.

Turkish military casts stern eye on radical Islam

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Celebrating the anniversary of a 1922
victory that helped bring secularism to power, Turkey's powerful
military on Sunday sharply reminded that country that it would
counter any surge of extremist Islamic movements.
	   Since pressuring modern Turkey's first Islamic-led government
out of power last year, the military has been doggedly opposing any
rise in radical Islam.
	   ``Any attempt to change the regime of secular and democratic
Turkish republic will definitely be ruined by our will and
determination,'' said new Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Huseyin
Kivrikoglu in his message to mark the 76th anniversary of the
country's victory over the invading forces of France, Britain,
Italy and Greece.
	   Kivrikoglu took over the command of Turkey's armed forces,
second largest within NATO, on Friday.
	   The valedictorian of the War School, Lt. Ali Cakan, led the
graduates in an oath with the same commitment as his commander,
Kivrikoglu.
	   ``We are determined to defend the republic until the very last
drop of our blood,'' Cakan said.
	   Prominent during the military parades and air shows were
hundreds of posters and banners honoring Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the
founder of modern Turkey along strictly secular lines.
	   Turks around the country hung Turkish flags from windows or
balconies around the country in what was seen as support for
secularism and its protector, the military.
	   Turkish law empowers the army to defend the country's
constitutionally guaranteed secular principles and defend it
against domestic as well as foreign threats.
	   Last year, the generals forced Islamic Premier Necmettin Erbakan
into resigning after he tried to increase the profile of Islam in
Turkish society. Erbakan's party, Welfare, was later banned for
anti-secular activities.
	   The military has staged takeovers three times since 1960, the
last military-led government running from 1980-83.

	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ Britain's Damon Hill won a
tumultuous Belgian Grand Prix Sunday, braving a rainstorm that
caused one of the biggest pile-ups in Formula One history and saw
hotheaded Michael Schumacher crash out with victory beckoning.
	   World standings leader Mika Hakkinen spun out on the first
hairpin and Schumacher seemed poised to take over the championship
lead until he hit the back of Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes teammate
David Coulthard, blinded by a sheet of spray. He was leading by
half a minute at the time.
	   Hill, the 1996 world champion, won his first Grand Prix in two
seasons and gave the Jordan team its first ever victory. It was
Hill's third win on Formula One's most challenging circuit. Ralf
Schumacher made it an incredible one-two finish for Jordan-Mugen
Honda, which had a terrible start to the season.
	   Hill completed the 44 laps around the 6.968-kilometer
(4.329-mile) circuit in one hour, 43 minutes 47.407 second, at an
average speed of 177.229 kilometers an hour. Ralf Schumacher
finished 0.932 seconds behind. Veteran Frenchman Jean Alesi drove
his Sauber-Petronas into third place, 7.240 seconds back.
	   ``It is a fantastic result,'' said Hill after greeting the
British Union Jack flags near the finish area. ``Now, we'll go out
to celebrate.''
	   Celebration was the farthest thing on anyone's mind just three
hours earlier.
	   The Grand Prix turned into one of the most spectacular ever on
the first lap, when a dozen of the 22 cars slammed into each other
in the downhill straight just after the opening La Source hairpin.
Coulthard was in third position when his car suddenly veered into
the protective wall and bounced back onto the track.
	   Blinded by spray coming off the leading cars, driver after
driver crashed into a wall of wrecks, tires and debris. Amazingly,
all drivers were able to walk away from the smoke and twisted
metal.
	   The race resumed nearly one hour later and Hakkinen started slow
off pole position and already had Schumacher breathing down his
neck at La Source. The Finn could not hold his line on the hairpin
and, with Schumacher nudging his car, he spun. Johnny Herbert
slammed into the McLaren and Hakkinen's race was over after about
10 seconds.
	   Schumacher moved past early leader Hill and with brilliant
wet-weather driving, he dominated until the 25th lap when he
prepared to lap Coulthard. The German miscalculated Coulthard's
speed and in near-invisibility, he slammed into the back the
McLaren, and lost his right frontwheel and any chance of victory.
	   Both drivers slumped to the pits and Schumacher marched over to
the McLaren stand to challenge Coulthard, accusing him of reckless
driving. Schumacher had to be restrained before he could reach the
Scot.
	   The McLaren team denied Coulthard deliberately tried to get
Schumacher out of the race and said he slowed down to let the
German pass.
	   With both Hakkinen and Schumacher out, the Finn held on to his
77-70 edge in the standings with only three races remaining on the
calendar.
	   With the championship leaders back in the pits, this season's
lesser gods took over and didn't disappoint. With four laps to go,
Hill, Ralf Schumacher and Alesi were within three seconds of each
other the thrilling race captivated the over 120,000 spectators up
to the end.

	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares
was among the first in line Sunday to vote on whether to reform the
constitution to allow him to seek re-election.
	   Supporters say the change would ensure political stability
during next year's handover of the Panama Canal and U.S. military
land. Opponents say it's an attempt to put friends of the ruling
Democratic Revolutionary Party in the best position to win land
development contracts.
	   Early in the steamy, tropical morning, Perez Balladares and his
wife voted at a Panama City primary school shortly after polls
opened.
	   ``We all have the right ... (and) civic obligation to send our
opinion, to decide the future of Panama,'' he said after casting
his ballot.
	   Panama's constitution restricts the president to one five-year
term, and re-election is only possible if a leader sits out two
terms. The next president will be elected in May and take office in
September, three months before the U.S. government turns over the
canal and U.S. military bases.
	   The pro-reform side spent millions of dollars on television and
radio commercials and ``Si'' flags, T-shirts and banners. A huge
street party Friday night drew tens of thousands of Panamanians.
	   But Rosa de Olive, who voted at the same school as the
president, was confident the proposed reform would lose.
	   ``Propaganda always does damage,'' she said.
	   A high portion of Panama's 845,747 registered voters was
expected to turn out before the more than 2,000 polling stations
closed at 2100 GMT.
	   Reform supporters hoped stormy skies would keep `No' voters at
home; and in the morning, a heavy rain poured on the capital.
Pro-reform groups also organized free transportation for voters who
needed to return to their home districts in the country's interior.
	   Observers from the Organization of American States raised
concern about the fairness of the service, but Perez Balladares
said it had been organized privately.
	   Reform opponents fear allowing the president to seek a
successive term would weaken Panama's democratic system, which took
hold just nine years ago after U.S. forces toppled the regime of
Gen. Manual Noriega.
	   Opposition leaders say Panama's system of checks-and-balances is
too weak to keep an autocrat from holding onto power. Others say
Perez Balladares _ who won office with just 33 percent of the vote
in 1994 _ has not done enough to help poor Panamanians.
	   Industry and agricultural workers say they have been left behind
by the administration's push to modernize the service sector. More
than 40 percent of Panama's 2.6 million people live below the
poverty level of dlrs 228 a month for a family of five.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Sri Lankan tailenders _ Suresh Perera and Muttiah
Muralitharan _ frustrated England for almost an hour to give the
visitors a handy lead in the one-off test at the Oval.
	   Inspired by a brilliant 213 by Sanath Jayasuriya and a fine 152
by Aravinda de Silva, Sri Lanka was finally bowled out for 591 in
its first innings.
	   This was after England had scored 445 after being sent in by the
visitors.
	   Sri Lanka, enjoying a 146-run lead, finds itself in a perfect
position to force only its fourth win overseas in 86 tests over 16
years.
	   Mark Butcher, eight not out, and Steve James, unbeaten on five,
batted out the seven overs before tea to take England to 13 without
loss at the break.
	   In fact, Sri Lanka's total is its highest in a test outside Sri
Lanka, improving on its 491 for seven declared in the one-off test
against England at Lord's in 1984.
	   After a late order collapse saw Sri Lanka lose ground after
resuming the day on 446 for three to 532 for nine, the last pair
put on an invaluable 59 runs to drive England into despair.
	   Perera, the 20-year old debutant, hit an unbeaten 43 while
Muralitharan, who tormented the England first innings with 7-115,
hit 30 off 36 balls with five boundaries.
	   The pair came together after medium paceman Angus Fraser had
grabbed 2-1 in 11 balls after lunch to remove Kumara Dharmasena
(13) and Pramodaya Wickramasinghe (0).
	   Perera's innings included a straight driven six off Fraser and
six sweetly timed boundaries.
	   Sri Lanka, looking to build a big first innings lead, lost
skipper Arjuna Ranatunga (51) and Hashan Tillakaratne (0) to
successive balls from medium paceman Darren Gough.
	   But De Silva, uncharacteristically subdued throughout his 17th
test century, was joined by Romesh Kaluwitharana (25) and briefly
repaired the damages with a 38-run stand for the sixth wicket.
	   De Silva, playing ion his 74th test, reached his 150, but four
balls later, edged a Ben Hollioake outswinger to wicketkeeper Alec
Stewart.
	   De Silva batted for 42 minutes over seven hours and shared two
important stands _ a record 243 for the third with Jayasuriya, and
122 with Ranatunga for the fourth wicket. He hit 17 boundaries off
292 balls.
	   Kaluwitharana fell before de Silva, an uppish drive was well
caught on the rebound by John Crawley at short extra cover off
Dominic Cork.
	   Ranatunga's innings included seven boundaries and a six while
Kaluwitharana hit two fours in his 58-minute stay at the crease.
	   Fraser was the pick of the bowlers with 3-95 while Gough,
Hollioake and Cork took two wickets apiece.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algerian President Liamine Zeroual plans
to argue for an international convention on fighting terrorism when
he attends this week's Nonaligned Movement summit in South Africa,
diplomats say.
	   The Algerian leader, fighting a bloody insurgency at home, left
Sunday on an African trip that will take him to Mozambique, South
Africa and Namibia.
	   Zeroual was to spend two days in Maputo, Mozambique at the
invitation of President Joaquim Chissano. Then he heads to Durban
for the 12th summit of the Nonaligned Movement.
	   There, he plans to present new ideas for an accord on fighting
terror, diplomats in Algiers said on condition of anonymity.
	   Massacres and bombings during Algeria's 6-year-old Islamic
insurgency have left some 75,000 people dead.
	   In the latest violence, 10 people were killed Saturday night in
the region of Ain Defla west of Algiers, French radio reported.
	   Zeroual, accompanied by his foreign minister, Ahmed Attaf, will
end his African trip with a three-day visit to Namibia.

Yemeni workers at Hunt Oil Company Oil to strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Some 1,300 Yemeni workers at the American
Hunt Oil Company announced Sunday that they will begin an
open-ended strike on Monday, an official with the workers' union
said.
	   The decision to strike came after the union failed to reach a
compromise with the oil company and the Oil Ministry, said the
official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The workers, including technical and management staff, are
demanding full medical insurance, overtime payments, late shift and
risk incentives and equal treatment with American co-workers, he
said.
	   He said the strike will continue until all their demands are
met.
	   Hunt Oil Company has a concession in an oil field in Marib, in
northern Yemen, with a production capacity of 165,000 barrels per
day. The company hires 1,300 Yemeni staff in addition to 30 foreign
workers.

Albright sets meeting with NATO commander

<TEXT>
	   BIJELJINA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Western contingency plans
for an attack on Serb forces in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo are
accelerating, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Sunday.
	   On a stopover en route to the presidential summit in Moscow,
Albright said she would meet Monday with NATO's top military
officer, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark.
	   Renewing an old warning, Albright said forces are being
identified for use in an attempt to halt the Serb offensive that
has claimed a high civilian toll and left tens of thousands of
people homeless.
	   Albright stressed that the top U.S. priority remains finding a
diplomatic solution to the struggle between the Serbs and
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.
	   ``Neither the United States nor the European allies can tolerate
this much longer,'' she said on a busy day in the Balkans that was
marked also by positive signs.
	   In Bijeljina, the Bosnian Serb half of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Albright met with leaders credited with trying to implement the
1995 Dayton peace accord that ended 3 1/2 years of warfare.
	   They have been rewarded with U.S. assistance, which Albright
said would be increased by dlrs 20 million to dlrs 30 million this
year.
	   She visited a rebuilt feeder station that supplies electricity
to 110,000 people and three industrial zones. The project was
finished three days ago. And dlrs 1.6 million in U.S. contributions
will also be used to bring clean water to the area.
	   ``You should be very proud. It's a great message to run on,''
she told Biljana Plavsic, the president of the Serb republic, who
broke from war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic and will seek
another term in nationwide elections in two weeks.
	   By the end of the year, Albright said, the United States will
have provided dlrs 100 million in aid to Bosnia. ``The election
will be a chance to tell us what kind of country Bosnia will be,''
she said.
	   Earlier, in Croatia, she lectured President Franjo Tudjman on
the pace of return of ethnic Serb refugees, a press that is still
partly under government control and Croatia's close ties to ethnic
Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   ``Bosnian Croats have to be able to act independently,''
Albright said, referring to the Western effort to establish a
diversified, peaceful state in a region populated with often
clashing communities.
	   Tudjman resisted. At a joint news conference, he said Croats in
Bosnia should not be denied their ``mark of identity,'' conjuring
up the notion of creating a ``greater Croatia'' at Bosnia's
expense.

	   CRATHIE, Scotland (AP) _ The royal family gathered Sunday at the
Scottish castle where they first heard of the death of Princess
Diana a year ago.
	   The day before the anniversary of her death, Diana's sons,
Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 14, went to Sunday morning
services with their father, grandparents, uncles and cousins, and
the rest of the local parishioners at tiny Crathie church.
	   In London, admirers of the princess brought bouquets by the
hundreds to the gates of her old home of Kensington Palace, a
fragrant echo of the mourning and the weeklong vigil that followed
the princess' death.
	   ``I thought there would be more flowers and more people here,''
said Liegh O'Malley, 50, who came from suburban Essex county. ``But
it is wonderful to see everyone coming from all over the world to
remember.''
	   While congregations around the country remembered Diana and her
family in prayer, the Rev. Robert Sloan led the services at
Crathie.
	   ``Hear our prayers for those grieving the loss of a loved one in
circumstances known to the world but only experienced by a few,''
he said, as William and Harry sat on either side of Prince Charles
in the front pew.
	   Scores of well-wishers, strung along the tree-shaded approach to
the church, waited quietly for the limousines to move slowly past,
waving at Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, the Queen Mother
Elizabeth and two younger generations, who smiled and waved back.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, who are visiting
Balmoral Castle for the weekend, also got a subdued greeting.
	   ``The Scottish people are more reserved than the British,'' said
Robert Robertson, 27, standing outside the church. ``But Princess
Diana was held in as high regard here as in London.''
	   At St. James's Palace in London, where Harry and William now
live with Prince Charles, Diana's former employees and other
members of the royal household will take part on Monday in a
service of remembrance. Diana's body lay at St. James's Palace
before the funeral at Westminster Abbey.
	   Quiet dignity and privacy are very much the mood of family
memorial plans _ and as far removed as could be from the massive
funeral televised to millions around the world Sept. 6.
	   The royal family will meet again Monday at Crathie church for
private prayers, joined by the prime minister and his wife.
	   Diana's brother and sisters and their families will mark the
anniversary even more privately, nearly 500 miles (800 km) south at
the lake where the princess is buried on an island at Althorp, the
Spencers' ancestral home. The estate and its memorial museum closed
Sunday for the season.
	   A granite and bronze sculpture of Diana and Dodi Fayed, the
lover with whom she died, will be unveiled Monday at Harrods, the
London store owned by Fayed's father.
	   The national flag, the Union Jack, will fly at half staff on
government buildings and royal residences. Some businesses will be
closed because the day is, coincidentally, the end of August
``bank'' holiday.''
	   The public will be able to attend memorial services at St.
Paul's Cathedral, where Diana and Charles were married, and at the
Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral.
	   But for most Britons, it's likely to be just another day.
	   The Daily Telegraph on Friday published the results of a
telephone survey by Gallup which found that 94 percent of those
questioned said they had no plans to mark the anniversary. While 28
percent wanted the day to be an occasion for national remembrance,
69 percent thought it should be left for individuals to mark as
they choose.
	   The survey of 1,009 people had a margin of error of three
percentage points.
	   A week ago, a Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Walk for charity
fizzled on a damp Sunday in London when only a few hundred turned
up to follow the route of Diana's cortege, instead of the expected
15,000.
	   A National Opinion Poll published by The Sunday Times last week
said three-fourths of the respondents wanted an end to the ``cult
of Diana.''
	   In a message on Friday, Church of England Bishop Mark Santer
said: ``The time comes when we have to let go of part of the past,
into the hands of God. It is time to let Diana rest in peace.''

Main points of Russia's proposed political agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Key points of a draft political agreement between the Russian
president, government and parliament:
	   _ Parliament would not initiate a no-confidence vote in the
government or seek to impeach the president before its term expires
in late 1999. President Boris Yeltsin would not use his right to
disband parliament.
	   _ Prime minister would appoint Cabinet ministers in consultation
with parliament. Yeltsin would keep the right to propose candidates
for prime minister and appoint the ministers of defense, security
and foreign affairs. Parliament would approve other government
appointments and dismissals.
	   _ The media law would be changed to allow for increased public
control over state-run TV and radio outlets.
	   _ Parliament would give priority to discussing the Cabinet's
anti-crisis program.

Blair discusses Russian crisis with leaders of major powers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Blair speaking to Kohl and Obuchi, comment from
spokesman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair is calling leaders of
the major industrialized powers to share assessments of Russia's
economic crisis and political changes.
	   Blair, who holds the rotating chairmanship of the Group of Eight
major industrialized nations, spoke to U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday night and to French President Jacques Chirac and
Italy's Prime Minister Romano Prodi on Saturday.
	   On Sunday, he conferred with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Japanese premier Keizo Obuchi and also planned to speak to Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
	   ``There is a clear feeling ... that it is in all our interests
to make sure Russia gets through this crisis and that it will best
do so by sticking to the reform path,'' said a spokesman for Blair,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The spokesman said there are no plans for an emergency summit of
the group.
	   Russia, whose economic crisis has been building all summer, is
the newest member of the Group of Eight. The growing global turmoil
in developing markets hit Russia, leading to the collapse of its
financial markets and forcing the government to devalue the ruble
two weeks ago. This triggered a larger crisis of confidence in
President Boris Yeltsin's government.
	   Blair has been making the calls from Balmoral Castle in Scotland
where he and his wife, Cherie, are guests of Queen Elizabeth II.
The prime minister traditionally spends a weekend at Balmoral when
the queen is vacationing with her family.

Gunmen in Lebanon kill owner of liquor store, wound another
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen shot and killed the
owner of a liquor store and wounded another in southern Lebanon
Sunday, security officials said.
	   They said two gunmen on a motorcycle shot Wajih Ramadan inside
his shop at 10.30 a.m. (7:30 GMT) in the coastal town of Wadi
al-Zeineh, five kilometers (three miles) north of the port city of
Sidon, killing him instantly.
	   Ten minutes later, the same gunmen shot Ibrahim Abbas at his
liquor store in the coastal town of Rmeileh, two kilometers (1.2
miles) north of Sidon, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Abbas suffered wounds in his shoulder and was rushed to a
hospital in Sidon, provincial capital of southern Lebanon, they
said.
	   Lebanese army and police set up checkpoints on main roads in
Sidon and mounted a manhunt for the two gunmen.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday's
shootings, which came nearly a month after a liquor shop owner was
killed by unidentified gunmen in Sidon.
	   Security officials and local residents believe Muslim
fundamentalist groups, seeking a ban on alcohol in Muslim-populated
areas, could be behind the shootings.

Swiss have new ``King'' in sawdust-wrestling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Staffing &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS BRUNNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's beloved national sawdust
wrestling championship climaxed Sunday with the crowning of a
19-year-old carpenter as King.
	   Joerg Abderhalden received the coveted title _ and an
accompanying pedigree bull called Adrian _ for pinning his opponent
down after a sweaty contest combining muscles, tactics and
impeccable manners.
	   More than 70,000 fans and traditional troupes of yodelers, alp
horn blowers and folk dancers, packed into Bern's sun-drenched
soccer stadium during the two-day competition to cheer the burly
national heroes.
	   ``Schwingen,'' German for ``swing'' _ is more than just the
national sport. It is also a unique insight into what _ apart from
cuckoo clocks _ makes the fiercely independent Swiss tick.
	   ``Schwingen belongs to Switzerland,'' declared President Flavio
Cotti. ``We are proud of our country and our traditions. And we
will defend them.''
	   Dating back about 1,000 years, the sport was banned during the
16th and 17th century as authorities found it undignified. It was
reborn in the early 1800's as a symbol of strength and unity
against Napoleonic Europe.
	   ``Steinstossen,'' _ another integral part of the event in which
men toss a boulder weighing 83 kilograms (182 lbs) _ recalls the
era when mountain farmers used to chuck huge rocks to keep away
intruders.
	   That spirit lives on.
	   Even today, followers of ``Schwingen'' _ overwhelmingly male and
from the country's conservative rural heartland _ mistrust outside
interference.
	   A fact which helps explain popular anger against U.S.-led
accusations that neutral Switzerland colluded with the Nazis in
World War II. Mindful of the mood, the Swiss government is not
planning to contribute taxpayers' money to a recent dlrs 1.25
billion settlement reached between commercial banks and Holocaust
victims.
	   The national pride on display at the festival _ held every three
years _ also illustrates why Switzerland is still outside the
United Nations and European Union.
	   Cotti, a pro-European, said he had been warned not to raise the
subject of closer European integration in his speech.
	   ``I was told I should rather read from the telephone directory
or television schedules than deal with the theme of Europe,'' he
said.
	   His advisers warned him he would otherwise risk seeing stars in
front of his eyes _ and not those of the European Union's flags,
Cotti added. He was only half joking.
	   The rules of Schwingen are simple and strict. Competitors have
to wear khaki shorts over their long trousers. Each wrestler has to
keep one hand on the shorts of the opponent while trying to pin all
or part of his back to the sawdust.
	   Correct manners are a must. The winner helps the loser up and
brushes the sawdust off his back. All recipients of awards _
ranging from the winner's pedigree bull to color televisions and
vacuum cleaners _ must send written thanks within one week.
	   Marketing deals are frowned upon and prize winners are not meant
to sell off their trophies.
	   Abderhalden, 1.90 meters (6.3 feet) tall and weighing 120
kilograms (264 pounds), was regarded as the season's rising star
but was not the top favorite among the 300 competitors.
	   He defeated 31-year-old veteran Werner Vitali in the final for
the title as Schwinger King.

Kosovo Albanians disputes Serb accusations of mass murder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by Secretary of State Albright on
Kosovo. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP ) _ A pro-Albanian human rights group
disputed Sunday Serbian allegations that Kosovo Albanian guerrillas
had killed and burned 22 Serbs in the embattled southern Kosovo
province.
	   The Board for Protection of Human Rights and Freedoms, based in
Kosovo's capital Pristina, demanded an independent investigation to
determine if recently found human remains were those of Kosovo
Serbs.
	   Serbian police said Saturday they had discovered a crematory in
southern Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians allegedly had burned the
bodies of at least 22 Serb civilians.
	   They said the furnace, allegedly used to destroy the bodies of
civilians killed by the rebels, was found in the village of Klecka,
recently retaken by government forces.
	   The statement, carried by the official Tanjug news agency, was
the latest in a series of claims of brutality and atrocities by
both sides.
	   During a visit to Bosnian Serb leaders in the Bosnian town of
Bijeljina Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
renewed an old warning, said forces are being identified for use in
an attempt to halt the Serb offensive against ethnic Albanian
militants.
	   But Albright stressed that the top U.S. priority remains finding
a diplomatic solution to the struggle between the Serbs and
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.
	   ``Neither the United States nor the European allies can tolerate
this much longer,'' she said.

Chronology of financial, political crisis in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A chronology of events in Russia during the past
eight days:
	   Sunday, Aug. 23 _ Yeltsin fires Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
and reinstates Viktor Chernomyrdin as acting prime minister.
	   Monday, Aug. 24 _ Yeltsin says he brought Chernomyrdin back
because he needed a ``heavyweight'' to tackle the burgeoning
economic crisis. Reformer Boris Nemtsov quits as first deputy prime
minister. Value of the ruble falls to 7.14 to the dollar (14 cents)
from 6.29 (16 cents) a week earlier.
	   Tuesday, Aug. 25 _ Ruble falls 9.2 percent to close at 7.86
(12.7 cents), biggest one-day plunge in nearly four years. Currency
trading suspended twice when banks overwhelmed by demand for
dollars.
	   Wednesday, Aug. 26 _ Central bank cancels already-agreed dollar
sales for first time. Government fails to make payments on
longer-term debt previously unaffected by the crisis. Ruble falls 5
percent to 8.26 to dollar (12.1 cents).
	   Thursday, Aug. 27 _ Opposition demands that Yeltsin resign,
drafts power-sharing agreement and package of Soviet-style economic
measures to reverse reforms.
	   Friday, Aug. 28 _ Yeltsin goes on national television to declare
he won't resign. Currency trades suspended for third straight day,
but stocks rise slightly in light trading. Ruble's street hovers
below 10 to the dollar (10 cents).
	   Saturday, Aug. 29 _ Chernomyrdin begins negotiating
power-sharing agreement with parliament, declares that Russia will
not return to a Soviet-style economy. Ruble's street value rises
slightly, is mostly above 10 to the dollar (10 cents).
	   Sunday, Aug. 30 _ The interim government and parliamentary
leaders agree to an 18-month truce that would leave Yeltsin in
control and give the administration time to try to end the crisis.

U.S. Secretary of State and Tudjman disagree over Bosnia

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Albright's comments in Serb-run
Bosnia in grafs 4-8. &QL; 
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright acknowledged Sunday that Croatia and the United States
disagree over Croatia's relations with Croats in neighboring
Bosnia.
	   ``Where we have a disagreement, I think, is in the relationship
of Croatia to Bosnian Croats,'' Albright said at a joint press
conference with President Franjo Tudjman.
	   Mrs. Albright arrived here late Saturday on a tour that later
Sunday took her to Bosnia. She was also to visit Russia and
Austria.
	   In Bijeljina, a town in the Serb half of Bosnia, Albright
conferred with Biljana Plavsic and Milorad Dodik, the president and
prime minister of the Serb substate, who are opposed to hard-liners
supporting the No. 1 war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic.
	   Albright made it clear that the United States is willing to help
only those in Bosnia who cooperate in implementing the Dayton peace
agreement.
	   ``We have been able to do this because the government and the
people of Republika Srpska ... have made a real commitment to
implement Dayton. They know that Dayton means jobs, reconstruction
and a normal life. In other words, Dayton pays.''
	   Albright signaled clear support for the two Serb top officials
and other moderates.
	   ``The elections will be a clear consequential choice. The voters
will help decide whether this will be a country that prospers from
trade or that stagnates in isolation, ... a country where criminals
will pay for their crimes or where honest people are murdered for
investigating them.''
	   Earlier, in Zagreb, Albright said, ``We believe that it's very
important for the Bosnian Croats to be able to act independently,''
voicing international officials' concerns that Tudjman's government
still stands behind all Bosnian Croat leaders' moves.
	   Tudjman admitted that the Bosnia issue ``is the main problem in
cooperation between the United States and Croatia.''
	   While saying that Croatia supports the Dayton agreement for
Bosnia, Tudjman argued that his government should, according to its
constitution, take care of its compatriots in Bosnia, ``who in many
ways feel imperiled.''
	   He charged that Bosnian Serbs, who control half of Bosnia, have
the right to their insignia and state-like institutions, ``while
Croats are deprived of using their national symbols.''
	   Albright pledged to speed up the return of Serbs, who fled en
masse when the government recaptured areas they seized in 1991.
	   She said that Croatia made some progress, but emphasized that
the U.S. still has ``important concerns,'' which include the state
of democracy in Croatia.
	   ``We urge political reforms and respect for free media,'' she
said.
	   In an attempt to nudge democracy in this young ex-Yugoslav
state, Albright also met leaders of the six strongest opposition
parties and representatives of independent media.
	   Tudjman rules with a firm hand, and his government is frequently
criticized for its treatment of minorities and the media.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ An armed rebellion launched four weeks
ago Sunday against President Laurent Kabila is sputtering to a halt
in the Congo's southwest, where loyalist forces recaptured the
area's last major rebel stronghold.
	   Angolan troops and tanks fighting on behalf of Kabila marched
into the Congo River port town of Matadi after insurgent fighters
reportedly airlifted their troops from the area in a hasty retreat.
	   Kabila's cabinet director, Abdoulaye Yerodia, said the rebels
set fire to Matadi's port _ the only major shipping facility
serving inland southwestern Congo.
	   ``This is a signal of what would come if their plan to take
Kinshasa succeeds,'' Yerodia told reporters.
	   Matadi was the last major town in Congo's southwest controlled
by a rebel coalition that won a string of stunning successes early
in the month-old uprising.
	   With the help of allied Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian forces,
Kabila's loyalist troops have regained ground nearly as quickly as
it was lost. The rebels are widely believed to be backed by
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, although both countries have denied
involvement.
	   The capital Kinshasa was quiet Sunday after days of pitched
combat on its western and eastern suburbs left bodies scattered
through the streets and triggered a vicious spree of lynching and
summary executions.
	   Responding to complaints from foreign ambassadors in Kinshasa,
Yerodia defended his military's conduct.
	   ``The reality of this situation is that the front is
everywhere,'' he said. ``The aggressors are hiding in houses and
back alleys in all quarters. If there are fronts everywhere in
Kinshasa, there is war everywhere.''
	   The charred corpses of suspected rebels lie along some streets
in downtown Kinshasa.
	   Officials say hundreds and perhaps thousands of rebel fighters
have surrendered or been killed in the past few days of fighting.
	   The rebels, however, say they are not finished.
	   The insurgent coalition force of ethnic Tutsis and former
Congolese soldiers still control key cities in the country's east,
including Goma, Bukavu and Kisangani.
	   Yerodia said a key power dam at the town Inga, southwest of
Kinshasa, had been recaptured by Congo's allies, although
electricity to the capital had not yet been restored.
	   ``This is due to a technical fault,'' Deputy Interior Minister
Faustin Munene said in a state radio broadcast.
	   Rebel leader Jean-Pierre Ondekane remained defiant.
	   ``They say the war is over but I say the war in not finished,''
said Ondekane. ``We're in Kinshasa fighting. The situation is going
well.''
	   Rebel troops slipped past government defenses in various parts
of Kinshasa last week and launched an attack for the airport and
the city's eastern outskirts.
	   Government, Angolan and Zimbabwean troops searched door-to-door
Sunday in search of insurgent forces hiding amid the population,
Yerodia said.
	   Kabila, meanwhile, flew to Zimbabwe, where he was expected to
thank the country for sending troops.
	   Kabila won the support of several neighboring countries after
insisting the Congolese rebellion was in fact an invasion by Rwanda
and Uganda.
	   Rwanda's Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana on Sunday criticized
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia for helping Kabila, who he accused of
training 10,000 soldiers to unseat Rwanda's government.
	   Rwanda has repeatedly threatened to intervene in the conflict to
protect its vital interests in the turbulent eastern border region
of Congo.
	   Gasana made the comments in South Africa, where he is attending
a summit of Non-Aligned Movement member states.
	   The heads of state from 51 members of the Non-Aligned Movement
were meeting in South Africa, where the conflict in Congo was to be
discussed.

	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ Britain's Damon Hill won a
chaotic Belgian Grand Prix Sunday, braving a rainstorm that caused
one of the biggest pile-ups in Formula One history and saw
hotheaded Michael Schumacher crash out with victory beckoning.
	   World standings leader Mika Hakkinen spun out on the opening
hairpin and Schumacher seemed poised to take over the championship
lead until he hit the back of Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes teammate
David Coulthard, blinded by a sheet of spray. He was leading by
half a minute at the time.
	   It allowed Hill, the 1996 world champion, to won his first Grand
Prix in two seasons and gave the Jordan team its first ever
victory. It was Hill's third win on Formula One's most challenging
circuit. Ralf Schumacher made it an incredible one-two finish for
Jordan-Mugen Honda, which had a terrible start to the season.
	   Hill completed the 44 laps around the 6.968-kilometer
(4.329-mile) circuit in one hour, 43 minutes 47.407 second, at an
average speed of 177.229 kilometers an hour. Ralf Schumacher
finished 0.932 seconds behind. Veteran Frenchman Jean Alesi drove
his Sauber-Petronas into third place, 7.240 seconds back.
	   ``It is a fantastic result,'' said Hill after greeting the
British Union Jack flags near the finish area. ``Now, we'll go out
to celebrate.''
	   Celebration was the farthest thing on anyone's mind just three
hours earlier.
	   A dozen of the 22 cars slammed into each other in the downhill
straight just after the opening La Source hairpin. Coulthard was in
third position when his car suddenly veered into the protective
wall and bounced back onto the track.
	   Blinded by spray coming off the leading cars, driver after
driver crashed into a wall of wrecks, tires and debris. Amazingly,
all drivers were able to walk away from the smoke and twisted
metal.
	   The race resumed nearly one hour later and Hakkinen started slow
off pole position and already had Schumacher breathing down his
neck at La Source. The Finn could not hold his line on the hairpin
and, with Schumacher nudging his car, he spun. Johnny Herbert
slammed into the McLaren and Hakkinen's race was over after about
10 seconds.
	   Schumacher moved past early leader Hill and with brilliant
wet-weather driving, he dominated until the 25th lap when he
prepared to lap Coulthard. The German miscalculated Coulthard's
speed and in near-invisibility, he slammed into the back the
McLaren, and lost his right frontwheel and any chance of victory.
	   Both drivers slumped to the pits and an outraged Schumacher
marched over to the McLaren stand to challenge Coulthard, accusing
him of reckless driving. Schumacher had to be restrained before he
could reach the Scot.
	   The McLaren team denied Coulthard deliberately tried to get
Schumacher out of the race and said he slowed down to let the
German pass. The sudden shift of speed surprised Schumacher.
	   ``I didn't have any chance and banged into him,'' he said
afterwards. He clutched both hands to his head, considering he
could have easily become the world championship leader.
	   Coulthard said the conditions were so atrocious the race should
have been slowed by a safety car much earlier.
	   With both Hakkinen and Schumacher out, the Finn held on to his
77-70 edge in the standings with only three races remaining on the
calendar.
	   With the championship leaders back in the pits, this season's
lesser gods took over and didn't disappoint. With four laps to go,
Hill, Ralf Schumacher and Alesi were within three seconds of each
other the thrilling race captivated the over 120,000 spectators up
to the end.
	   Accidents dominated the whole weekend.
	   On Friday, reigning world champion Jacques Villeneuve lost
control of his Williams-Mecachrome on the famed Eau-Rouge corner at
some 290 kilometers an hour (180 mph) and crashed backward into a
protective tire barrier. He was not hurt.
	   On Saturday, the infamous Eau Rouge corner claimed yet another
crash victim.
	   Finland's Mika Salo lost control of his Arrows-Yamaha at almost
the exact same uphill spot during morning practice and his car
slammed at high speed into protective tires before spinning four
times on the track and coming to a standstill.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Aviation experts began Sunday sifting
through the charred remains of a Cuban commercial airplane to look
for clues about why it burst into flames during takeoff and crashed
high in the Andes mountains, killing 78 people.
	   Red Cross workers dug through the charred wreckage for
survivors, while firefighters sprayed jets of waters on the smoking
ruins to prevent further explosions.
	   At least 22 passengers reportedly survived Saturday's crash.
	   ``Before we heard the roar of the crash, we felt the plane rise
a bit and burst in flames. There were three explosions,'' one of
the survivors, Hernan Boada, 27, of Cuba told a Channel 10
television station. ``I saw other people wrapped in flames jump
from the plane.''
	   The Russian-made Tupolev 154 aircraft owned by Cubana de
Aviacion burst into flames Saturday during takeoff and slammed into
two homes, clipped the top of a auto mechanic's workshop and a
soccer field located 200 yards (180 meters) beyond the end of the
runway at Quito's International Airport. At least five children on
the ground were killed.
	   The nose and front part of the plane disintegrated in the crash.
	   The jetliner barely missed a heavily traveled avenue at the end
of the airport runway in a middle-class residential neighborhood
9,300 feet (2,835 meters) above sea level. It was en route first to
Guayaquil, on the Ecuadorean coast, then to Havana.
	   Cuba's official Prensa Latina news agency said Sunday that a
team of experts from Cuba's civilian aeronautics agency had arrived
in Quito to help in the investigation.
	   Alvaro Martinez of Chile, who survived the crash with minor
injuries, said that even though the engine made a loud sound before
takeoff, the pilot insisted on flying the plane.
	   ``This is a case of professional negligence that should be
condemned internationally. It is not possible that a pilot that
knows his plane has problems attempts to take off,'' he said.
	   The entire 14-person crew died in the crash. Two stewardesses
helped passengers escape from the burning plane but were enveloped
by the fire before they could escape, survivors told local
newspapers.
	   Gen. Osvaldo Dominguez, director of the Civil Aviation Office,
said 78 people died in the crash, including nine people on the
ground. He said at least 19 foreigners were killed, including
Cubans, Chileans, Italians, Spaniards, one Argentine and one
Jamaican.
	   Prensa Latina reported that 68 people on the plane had died.
There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.
	   President Jamil Mahuad went to the crash site and said he was
asking investigators to complete studies as soon as possible for
building an airport outside the capital. ``I deeply lament the
tragedy,'' Mahuad said. ``This is one more reason to relocate the
airport as soon as possible.''
	   People have often complained about the noise and the possibility
of accidents at the current airport.
	   In 1984, an Ecuadorean cargo plane slammed into a neighborhood
beyond the end of the runway after failing to gain altitude,
killing 65 people.
	   And in 1996, a Brazilian FLY airlines plane carrying a Brazilian
soccer team, crashed into some airport walls after one of the jet
turbines flamed out and the crew aborted the takeoff. One player
was slightly injured.
	   The Cubana plane used the same takeoff route as the two planes,
which both fell in roughly the same spot as the Cubana plane.

Elton John criticizes Diana's family for burying her on remote
</HEADLINE>
island &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Britain-Diana Anniversary &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir Elton John, whose adaptation of ``Candle in
the Wind'' in memory of Princess Diana captured the grief of
millions around the world, has criticized her family's decision to
bury her on a tiny island far from her sons and her adoring public.
	   The rock star, in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, said
Diana should have been buried in Westminster Abbey where her
funeral took place and not on an island in a lake at Althorp, her
family's ancestral home 65 miles (105 kms) northwest of London.
	   ``I just feel it's sad that she's on that island _ it's as if
she's all alone again,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   The singer and the princess met in 1981, at Prince Andrew's 21st
birthday party when she asked him to dance. She was a fan and they
became friends.
	   Singing goobye to ``England's rose'' at her funeral was, he
says, ``the biggest thing I'd ever done.''
	   ``I didn't want it to be cheesy; I didn't want to come across as
`the pop star at the Abbey.' I just wanted it to be full of how I
felt,'' John was quoted as saying.
	   The singer said he didn't think that turning Diana into a
``commercial enterprise'' was the right way to mark her death.
	   The princess' brother, Earl Spencer, opened Althorp's gates on
July 1, the date of his sister's birthday, to allow thousands of
tourists to see Diana's final resting place, at a cost of 9.50
pounds (dlrs 15.75) per ticket.
	   John also attacked the commercialization of her memory,
especially putting her name on margarine tubs to raise money for
the memorial fund established to honor her.
	   ``I just think that some of the things that have been done in
her name have been extremely tacky. Extremely thoughtless towards
the boys,'' the singer was quoted as saying.
	   ``It's none of my business but, if I was going to bury her
anywhere, I would have liked it to have been in Westminster Abbey
so that people could come in and they wouldn't have to pay to see
her,'' John was quoted as saying.
	   He apparently was unaware that Westminster Abbey recently
imposed an admission charge of 5 pounds (dlrs 8.00) except for
those attending services.
	   Diana's boys, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13, are with
their father, Prince Charles, grandmother Queen Elizabeth II and
other members of the royal family at Balmoral Castle in Scotland.
They were told of their mother's death in the early hours of Aug.
31 while vacationing at Balmoral _ and they will attend a private
service in her memory near the Scottish retreat on Monday.

Kosovo Albanians disputes Serb accusations of mass murder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with amplified Albright quote in graf 7, more charges
against Serbian police in grafs 17-18. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP ) _ A pro-Albanian human rights group
disputed Sunday Serbian allegations that Kosovo Albanian guerrillas
had killed and burned 22 Serbs in the embattled southern Kosovo
province.
	   The Board for Protection of Human Rights and Freedoms, based in
Kosovo's capital Pristina, demanded an independent investigation to
determine if recently found human remains were those of Kosovo
Serbs.
	   Serbian police said Saturday they had discovered a crematory in
southern Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians allegedly had burned the
bodies of at least 22 Serb civilians.
	   They said the furnace, allegedly used to destroy the bodies of
civilians killed by the rebels, was found in the village of Klecka,
recently retaken by government forces.
	   The statement, carried by the official Tanjug news agency, was
the latest in a series of claims of brutality and atrocities by
both sides.
	   During a visit to Bosnian Serb leaders in the Bosnian town of
Bijeljina Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
renewed an old warning, said forces are being identified for use in
an attempt to halt the Serb offensive against ethnic Albanian
militants and the civilian population.
	   ``The tragedy of watching the people who have been expelled from
their homes and various killings, I think, is something that
neither the U.S. nor the European allies can tolerate much
longer,'' she said.
	   But Albright stressed that the top U.S. priority remains finding
a diplomatic solution to the conflict.
	   In Pristina, the pro-Albanian rights group said Sunday: ``The
monstrous crime was blamed on members of the Kosovo Liberation army
without first determining the truth first by unbiased, competent
experts.''
	   It hinted the remains might have been of Kosovo Albanians killed
elsewhere in the province and planted as false evidence.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have waged a months-long
offensive to crush the KLA, which is spearheading the independence
fight of Kosovo's Albanian majority. Kosovo is a province of
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides, and more than
260,000 have been rendered homeless by the fighting which erupted
in Kosovo in March this year between government forces and the KLA.
	   Both Serb and Albanian sources reported Sunday a shootout in the
village of Susica, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of
Pristina, where eight ethnic Albanians were killed on Saturday.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center said Serbian police
in armored vehicles surrounded several houses of the Salihaj
family, issuing an ultimatum for all to surrender.
	   Women and children left, but the men remained, and in an ensuing
battle eight of the ethnic Albanians died and one was arrested.
Bodies of the killed were allegedly mutilated.
	   A terse police version of the same incident, carried by the
official Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency, said police were
engaged in fighting in Susica while searching for a ``terrorist
group,'' led by Saban Salihaj, 42, wanted in the slaying of three
Serbian policemen in June. The wording suggested he was a KLA
leader. ` The Kosovo Information Center also blamed authorities
Sunday for beating to death an ethnic Albanian, Bilal Sala, who was
arrested on Friday. Sala allegedly died in a police station from
torture, possibly during an interrogation.
	   The Albanian source also said the police shot dead a Kosovo
Albanian refugee, in the village of Pecane, near Suva Reka, some 40
kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina. He was seeking to
return home after fleeing earlier fighting.
	   On Saturday, the Red Cross evacuated 13 women and children, who
were wounded Thursday by fierce shelling, from a crowded refugee
village to Pristina.
	   The victims were among an estimated 50,000 ethnic Albanians near
Senik village, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of
Pristina, where they fled after their own communities were shelled
by Yugoslav army tanks.
	   In Pristina, some of the evacuees from around Senik said the
attack Thursday targeted only civilians.
	   Maggie Bryson of the International Red Cross, who helped
evacuate the 13, said conditions around Senik were deplorable.
	   With the onset of cold weather, the estimated 50,000 refugees
camped out in the open in isolated areas were facing an
``absolutely dreadful'' situation, she said.
	   ``Without shelter, people cannot survive,'' she said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's political leaders hammered out a
tentative deal Sunday to swiftly approve a new government under
Boris Yeltsin and call a political truce to tackle the country's
political and economic crisis.
	   The proposed agreement would give the State Duma, parliament's
lower house, more say in Cabinet appointments, but leave Yeltsin
with substantial power, despite earlier opposition calls for his
removal.
	   In particular, the president would retain control of the
security forces with the right to fill three key posts _ the
defense, foreign and interior ministries.
	   If the deal gets through, the Communists and their allies would
swiftly confirm acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in Duma
hearings, possibly as soon as Monday. In exchange, Yeltsin would
agree to Duma approval of most Cabinet appointments for the first
time, according to lawmakers and media reports.
	   The draft, which was not made public, would also oblige both
sides to maintain a political truce. The Duma would not try to vote
the government out of power until parliament's term ends in late
1999, while Yeltsin would not use his right to dissolve the
legislature _ although he apparently would not lose this power.
	   Chernomyrdin expressed optimism that with the formation of a new
Cabinet the nation's economic crisis could be overcome.
	   ``We must resolve financial problems. The ruble is hanging by a
thread,'' he said. ``So if we have a political agreement and the
president accepts it _ let's start working.''
	   Russia was plunged into political and economic crisis when
financial markets and the currency collapsed as the government
defaulted on its debts and the country was hit by the global furor
in developing markets. Ordinary Russians fear they face yet more
hardships after years of upheaval, but there have been few signs of
panic on the streets of Moscow and other cities.
	   The ruble appeared to gain Sunday and exchange points across
Moscow were buying U.S. dollars at an average 8 rubles (12.5
cents), down from an average 8.5 (11.7 cents) the day before. The
rate had been 6 rubles to the dollar (16.6 cents) before the
collapse.
	   But there was no immediate confirmation that Yeltsin would
accept the deal, even though it left him with a firm grip on power.
If the deal is accepted by all sides, changes to the constitution
reportedly are to be made within one month.
	   Yeltsin's parliament envoy Alexander Kotenkov gave the proposed
pact to the president at his country home outside Moscow. If
Yeltsin were to reject the document, it could trigger a new battle
for power with the Duma.
	   ``It's too early to speak about the final fate of the draft
political agreement,'' Kotenkov said cautiously. ``If anybody
thinks it'll be an easy decision for the president, they're
wrong.''
	   There was no word on an economic plan that had been discussed
with the opposition to handle the crisis. It called for imposing
some Soviet-style economic controls, but Chernomyrdin said Saturday
there was no question of restoring the Soviet system.
	   The Communists got through a provision setting up special public
councils to oversee the work of state-run radio and TV stations,
which the hard-liners long have accused of biased coverage.
	   Other details of the talks remained fuzzy as parliament leaders,
pausing for brief interviews, disappeared into their trademark
black cars that left with flashing lights from the Duma near the
Kremlin.
	   While Yeltsin would lose some power under the deal, it appeared
to represent a major step down by the hard-line opposition, which
had been calling for the president's removal and formal power
sharing. Yeltsin said last week he would never resign.
	   ``Maybe we would have liked some sections of the documents to be
tougher,'' admitted Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is speaker
of the State Duma.
	   The agreement could yet be derailed, even if Yeltsin approves
it.
	   The Communists reportedly were pushing for more concessions.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov called for unspecified changes to
the International Monetary Fund's terms for extending a dlrs 22.6
billion loan to Russia.
	   The Communists also called for formation of a Constitutional
Assembly, a new body that would take over ``if the situation gets
out of control'' and tighter controls on Yeltsin's powers to
nominate a prime minister.
	   Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back as prime minister a week ago
because he hoped the familiar figure would restore confidence in
the government, badly damaged by the ruble's sharp decline.

	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ Britain's Damon Hill won a
chaotic Belgian Grand Prix Sunday, braving a rainstorm that caused
one of the biggest pile-ups in Formula One history and saw
hotheaded Michael Schumacher crash out with victory beckoning.
	   World standings leader Mika Hakkinen spun out on the opening
hairpin and Schumacher seemed poised to take over the championship
lead until he hit the back of Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes teammate
David Coulthard, blinded by a sheet of spray. He was leading by
half a minute at the time.
	   It allowed Hill, the 1996 world champion, to win his first Grand
Prix in two seasons and gave the Jordan team its first ever
victory. It was Hill's third win on Formula One's most challenging
circuit. Ralf Schumacher made it an incredible one-two finish for
Jordan-Mugen Honda, overcoming a terrible start to the season.
	   Hill completed the 44 laps around the 6.968-kilometer
(4.329-mile) circuit in one hour, 43 minutes 47.407 second, at an
average speed of 177.229 kilometers an hour. Ralf Schumacher
finished 0.932 seconds behind. Veteran Frenchman Jean Alesi drove
his Sauber-Petronas into third place, 7.240 seconds back.
	   ``It is a fantastic result,'' said Hill after greeting the
British Union Jack flags near the finish area. ``Now, we'll go out
to celebrate.''
	   Celebration was the farthest thing on anyone's mind just three
hours earlier.
	   A dozen of the 22 cars slammed into each other in the downhill
straight just after the opening La Source hairpin. Coulthard was in
third position when his car suddenly veered into the protective
wall and bounced back onto the track.
	   Blinded by spray coming off the leading cars, driver after
driver crashed into a wall of wrecks, tires and debris. Amazingly,
all drivers were able to walk away from the smoke and twisted
metal.
	   The race resumed nearly one hour later and Hakkinen started slow
off pole position and already had Schumacher breathing down his
neck at La Source. The Finn could not hold his line on the hairpin
and, with Schumacher nudging his car, he spun. Johnny Herbert
slammed into the McLaren and Hakkinen's race was over after about
10 seconds.
	   Schumacher moved past early leader Hill and with brilliant
wet-weather driving, he dominated until the 25th lap when he
prepared to lap Coulthard. The German miscalculated Coulthard's
speed and in near-invisibility, he slammed into the back the
McLaren, and lost his right frontwheel and any chance of victory.
	   Both drivers slumped to the pits and an outraged Schumacher
marched over to the McLaren stand to challenge Coulthard, accusing
him of reckless driving. Schumacher had to be restrained.
	   The McLaren team denied Coulthard deliberately tried to get
Schumacher out of the race and said he slowed down to let the
German pass. The sudden shift of speed surprised Schumacher.
	   ``I didn't have any chance and banged into him,'' he said
afterwards, clutching both hands to his head.
	   Coulthard said the conditions were so atrocious the race should
have been slowed by a safety car much earlier.
	   With both Hakkinen and Schumacher out, the Finn held on to his
77-70 edge in the standings with only three races remaining on the
calendar.
	   With the championship leaders back in the pits, this season's
lesser gods took over and didn't disappoint. With four laps to go,
Hill, Ralf Schumacher and Alesi were within three seconds of each
other. The thrilling race captivated the over 120,000 spectators up
to the end.
	   Accidents dominated the whole weekend.
	   On Friday, reigning world champion Jacques Villeneuve lost
control of his Williams-Mecachrome on the famed Eau-Rouge corner at
some 290 kilometers an hour (180 mph) and crashed backward into a
protective tire barrier. He was not hurt.
	   On Saturday, the Eau Rouge corner claimed yet another crash
victim.
	   Finland's Mika Salo lost control of his Arrows-Yamaha at almost
the exact same uphill spot during morning practice and his car
slammed at high speed into protective tires before spinning four
times on the track and coming to a standstill.

Owen wrecks Gullit's debut as Newcastle coach; Liverpool wins 4-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ So much for the glamor of new coach
Ruud Gullit arriving and changing Newcastle's dismal, early season
start.
	   Liverpool, behind three goals in 15 minutes by 18-year-old
England international Michael Owen _ two in 85 seconds early in the
game _ drubbed Newcastle 4-1 Sunday in England's Premier League.
	   The victory moved Liverpool into first place with seven points,
the same as Aston Villa but superior on goal difference. Nottingham
Forest is third with six points.
	   Gullit, who was named in a shock announcement Thursday to
replace Kenny Dalglish, jotted notes and watched the match
impassively from the grandstand in the first half.
	   He could not have liked what he saw, particularly from a chaotic
defense.
	   The 38,000 sellout came to St. James' Park for a party, hoping
to see wide-open, imaginative soccer. They did _ from Liverpool _
as the Magpies added an abysmal loss to two lackluster draws under
Dalglish.
	   Liverpool sliced up Newcastle's defense, attacking relentlessly
in the first half hour with Owen scoring almost at will.
	   He struck in the 17th, driving home a rebound from eight meters
(yards) off a Paul Ince shot. Moments later in the 18th, he got a
pass from Steve McManaman and again scored from eight meters
(yards).
	   Newcastle's French international Stephane Guivarc'h stemmed the
flow in the 28th, scoring his first of the season from 10 meters
(yards) as his shot went in off the goalpost to the left of
Liverpool's American goalkeeper Brad Friedel.
	   But Owen struck again in the 32nd for his fourth of the season,
this time dribbling through two defenders and then chipping it home
from 10 meters.
	   Czech forward Patrik Berger added a fourth just seconds from
halftime as he scored on a left-footed drive from 18 meters.
	   Gullit moved to the bench for the second half as Newcastle
looked more poised, although Liverpool didn't press its advantage.
	   On Saturday, Aston Villa took a 1-0 victory at Sheffield
Wednesday on a goal in the 37th by Julian Joachim.
	   Nottingham Forest, on the third weekend of the season, defeated
Southampton 2-1. For Southampton, it was a third loss in three
games, leaving it last in the 20-team league.
	   Newly promoted Charlton, the surprise team of the early season,
held defending league and F.A. Cup champions Arsenal to a 0-0 draw
at the Gunners' north London stadium.
	   Arsenal had to settle for the draw when French international
Emmanuel Petit was sent off in the 58th minute after picking up his
second yellow card.
	   Despite the draw, Charlton _ the leaders after two weeks _
stayed in fourth place tied with four other clubs with five points:
Wimbledon, Arsenal, Leeds and West Ham.
	   Everton remained without a goal in three games, losing 1-0 to
Tottenham, another troubled side that had dropped its first two
games with coach Christian Gross's job clearly on the line.
	   In other games Saturday in the Premier League: Blackburn 1,
Leicester 0; Coventry 0, West Ham 0; Middlesbrough 1, Derby 1;
Wimbledon 1, Leeds 1.
	   In England's first division Saturday: Birmingham 0, Barnsley 0;
Bolton 2, Sheffield United 2; Huddersfield 3, Portsmouth 3; Oxford
United 0, Grimsby 0; Queens Park Rangers 0, Bury 0; Stockport 1,
Crystal Palace 1; Swindon 1, Port Vale 1; Tranmere 1, Bristol City
1; West Brom 2, Norwich 0.
	   In Scotland on Sunday, Kilmarnock defeated Hearts 3-0 and
Motherwell and Dundee United played a late game.
	   On Saturday, Rangers defeated St. Johnstone 4-0 on goals by
Andrei Kanchelskis (26th), Giovanni Van Bronckhorst (45th), Rod
Wallace (56th) and Jorg Albertz (penalty 85th).
	   In two other key matches Saturday in the Premier Division,
Celtic and Dundee played a 1-1 draw as did Dunfermline and
Aberdeen.

More police on hand for gathering at Diana memorial

	   PARIS (AP) _ Under the watchful eye of French police, people
gathered Sunday at the Pont de l'Alma, peering into the traffic
tunnel where Princess Diana met her death in a high-speed car crash
last August.
	   The police were on hand to prevent people from walking into the
traffic tunnel and perhaps causing an accident.
	   But the crowd of 150-200, largely tourists, was content to stare
across a wire fence at the entrance to the tunnel, and to gather
around a makeshift memorial full of flowers and handwritten notes.
	   ``I was in Paris on business, and I just felt like I had to make
this pilgrimage. It means a lot to me,'' said Janet Brill of Coral
Springs, Florida. ``I was really crushed when she died.''
	   More people were expected for a vigil on Monday, the anniversary
of Diana's Aug. 31 death.
	   All year, people have been paying homage to Diana at a makeshift
memorial by the bridge. The bronze Flame of Liberty _ a replica of
the flame of the Statue of Liberty _ was originally erected to
honor French-American ties. Now, its pedestal is covered with
flowers and handwritten notes to the three victims of the crash:
Diana, her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and driver Henri Paul.
	   ``You will always be the most beautiful,'' read a note scrawled
in magic marker on the bronze flame.
	   A colored sign from a child read: ``Diana, je t'aime (I love
you), Kelly B.''
	   There soon will be an official memorial to Diana, too. Last week
the city of Paris said it would transform a former school in the
heart of the capital into a nature center named after the princess.
	   The park in the historic Marais neighborhood, to open next
spring, will be aimed at teaching children to respect nature and
learn about gardening. The public will be able to visit the garden
on the weekends.
	   Mayor Jean Tiberi also has expressed the wish to rename a street
in Paris for Diana. But that procedure takes five years to
formalize.
	   A poll earlier this month showed 70 percent of French people
want a street or square to be named after her.

Near misses becoming laughing matter for Ivanisevic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA TOMMELLEO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ The summer of his discontent
nearly over, Goran Ivanisevic finds that laughter comes a bit
easier these days.
	   The talented and temperamental left-hander, winner of 21 singles
titles, comes to the U.S open at Flushing Meadow this week as the
14th seed. He's still searching for his first Grand Slam title and
still smarting somewhat from another Wimbledon finals loss.
	   Last week, he failed in his fifth attempt to win a tournament on
U.S. soil when he lost in the finals of the Pilot Pen
International, dropping a three-set decision to Karol Kucera, of
Slovakia.
	   He has two options, he said, as he prepares mentally for the
dlrs 14 million U.S. Open.
	   ``To think again or start to laugh,'' Ivanisevic said. ``If I
just now think about Wimbledon and (Pilot Pen), then I am going to
become crazy. So better laugh and have fun.''
	   He wasn't having much fun earlier this summer.
	   His five-set loss to Pete Sampras in July was his third defeat
in a Wimbledon final. The hard-serving Croat lost a five-setter to
Andre Agassi in 1992 and two years later fell in straight sets
again to Sampras.
	   Against Kucera, his antics ranged from angry to amusing when
close calls went against him or he missed easy winners. At various
times, he glared at line judge for several seconds, ripped his
shirt open in frustration, threw his racket and climbed into the
empty umpire's chair after the match to watch the award ceremony.
	   This week, he didn't make it out of the first round of the
Hamlet Cup in Commack, New York.
	   Fueling his frustration has been a chronic sore left shoulder,
made tender from a decade of dominating serves. Ivanisevic's
130-plus mph (210 kmh-plus) serves has been his calling card for
years. In 1996, he broke his own record by firing 1,477 aces on the
ATP Tour. He said the shoulder is a concern going into the five-set
competition of the U.S. Open.
	   ``I have to feel good, just hope my shoulder is going to be
fine,'' he said. ``You have to win three sets. It can be five sets
and it is not easy to play, but my form is fine.''
	   Ivanisevic admits he has to sometimes push himself to do daily
exercises for the shoulder but knows it is necessary.
	   ``I am not 21 anymore. I am going to be 27 pretty soon, and I
have to do it if I want to play another couple years of tennis,''
he said.
	   With maturity also comes mellowing and the ability to enjoy
himself even when he fights with the officials, he said.
	   ``Maybe I take too serious these losses and I just ... have to
have fun. Maybe it is going to help. I try new strategy from now,''
Ivanisevic said. ``Better to laugh than cry.''

Ejection doesn't mean homer chase is getting to McGwire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By R.B. FALLSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Just because Mark McGwire threw a bit of a
tantrum doesn't mean the home run chase is getting to him.
	   McGwire was able to shrug off his ejection in the first inning
of Saturday's game, staying loose as any of his teammates as he
entered Sunday night's game against the Atlanta Braves with 54
homers.
	   Through this season of chasing Roger Maris, McGwire has learned
how to keep things casual
	   On Friday night, he killed time playing ping-pong with his
10-year-old son Matthew, the team's sometime bat boy, and yukking
it up with visitors.
	   A few hours after being ejected for arguing a called third
strike in the first inning Saturday, he was glib enough to blame it
all on a pre-game chat with Indiana coach Bob Knight.
	   But McGwire is not about to apologize for showing some fire on
the field, much less drawing a line in the dirt with his bat during
the argument with rookie umpire Sam Holbrook that led to his third
banishment in two seasons. Sometimes, he said, confrontations are
unavoidable.
	   ``If you're in the heat of the moment and you're in competition,
I'm not thinking about walking away,'' McGwire said. ``I thought it
was ball four and I let him know what I thought. Period.''
	   McGwire noted that this sort of thing isn't rare in baseball. He
knows it's big news only because he's seven homers away from
baseball's most hallowed record and cost him a few at-bats. About a
half-hour after getting kicked out, he was ready to move on.
	   No grudges.
	   ``The only problem is we're under the microscope for what I'm
doing, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey,'' McGwire said. ``Anything we do
is going to be blown out of proportion, and please, it should not
be.
	   ``It's part of the game, it happened, let it die. It's just one
game.''
	   Manager Tony La Russa didn't mind it a bit that McGwire blew off
some steam.
	   ``For a number of years, big-league baseball has come across as
too cool,'' La Russa said. ``Managers are always talking to their
players about playing harder, which means, get your emotions into
it.
	   ``He responded emotionally, I think that's fine. He cared about
that at-bat.''
	   Both La Russa and McGwire agree that he went too far and paid
the price. McGwire definitely is the biggest show in baseball, but
he said he doesn't need or want any favors.
	   ``In the heat of competition, he threw me out of the ballgame,''
McGwire said. ``He's not going to be back behind the plate
thinking, `Oh, I can't throw him out.'
	   ``I have a thing to do, he has a thing to do. Did I cross the
line? Yeah, I probably crossed the line and I own up to it.''
	   La Russa said if he were wearing the mask, he'd probably have
given McGwire the heave-ho, too, considering Holbrook gave him
three warnings.
	   ``If I'm an umpire, I'd probably be a lot like they are now,''
La Russa said. ``It would have been a great time to walk away, but
you've got to be pretty special to have that kind of control of
yourself.
	   ``I don't think I could have done it. I think I'd have been just
like him.''

 &UR; Kosovo Albanians disputes Serb accusations of mass murder &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with human rights group asking for
independent probe into Serbian allegation of rebels' atrocities,
eight ethnic Albanian men killed in northern village; CHANGES

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A pro-Albanian human rights group on
Sunday disputed Serbian allegations that ethnic Albanian guerrillas
had killed and burned 22 Serbs in the embattled southern province
of Kosovo.
	   The Board for Protection of Human Rights and Freedoms, based in
Kosovo's capital, Pristina, demanded an independent investigation
to determine if recently found human remains were those of Kosovo
Serbs.
	   Serbian police said Saturday they had discovered a crematory in
southern Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians allegedly had burned the
bodies of at least 22 Serb civilians.
	   They said the furnace, allegedly used to destroy the bodies of
civilians killed by the rebels, was found in the village of Klecka,
recently retaken by government forces.
	   The statement, carried by the official Tanjug news agency, was
the latest in a series of claims of brutality and atrocities by
both sides.
	   During a visit Sunday to Bosnian Serb leaders in the Bosnian
town of Bijeljina, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
renewing an old warning, said forces are being identified for use
in an attempt to halt the Serb offensive against ethnic Albanian
militants.
	   ``The tragedy of watching the people who have been expelled from
their homes and various killings, I think, is something that
neither the U.S. nor the European allies can tolerate much
longer,'' she said.
	   But Albright stressed that the top U.S. priority remains finding
a diplomatic solution to the struggle between the Serbs and
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.
	   In Pristina, the pro-Albanian rights group said Sunday: ``The
monstrous crime was blamed on members of the Kosovo Liberation army
without first determining the truth first by unbiased, competent
experts.''
	   It also hinted the remains might have been those of Kosovo
Albanians killed elsewhere in the province and planted as false
evidence.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have waged a months-long
offensive to crush the KLA, which is spearheading the independence
fight of Kosovo's Albanian majority. Kosovo is a province of
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides, and more than
260,000 have been rendered homeless by the fighting, which erupted
in March this year.
	   Also Sunday, Serbian police said they had engaged in fighting
Saturday in the village of Susica, 60 kilometers (40 miles)
northwest of Pristina, while searching for a ``terrorist group,''
led by Saban Salihaj, 42, wanted in the slaying of three Serbian
policemen in June, according to a statement carried by the official
Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency. The statement implied that
Salihaj was a KLA leader
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center said Serbian police
in armored vehicles surrounded several houses of the Salihaj
family, issuing an ultimatum for all to surrender.
	   Women and children left, but the men remained, and eight of the
ethnic Albanians died in the fighting that ensued, according to the
center, which also alleged that the bodies of those killed were
mutilated.
	   The Kosovo Information Center also blamed authorities Sunday for
killing two more Kosovo Albanians, including one refugee who was
seeking to return home after fleeing earlier fighting.
	   On Saturday, the Red Cross evacuated 13 women and children, who
were wounded Thursday by fierce shelling, from a crowded refugee
village 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest to Pristina.
	   The victims were among an estimated 50,000 ethnic Albanians near
the village of Senik, where they fled after their own communities
were shelled by Yugoslav army tanks.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ An armed rebellion launched four weeks
ago Sunday against President Laurent Kabila is sputtering to a halt
in the Congo's southwest, where loyalist forces recaptured the
area's last major rebel stronghold.
	   Angolan troops and tanks fighting on behalf of Kabila marched
into the Congo River port town of Matadi after insurgent fighters
reportedly airlifted their troops from the area in a hasty retreat.
	   Kabila's cabinet director, Abdoulaye Yerodia, said the rebels
set fire to Matadi's port _ the only major shipping facility
serving inland southwestern Congo.
	   ``This is a signal of what would come if their plan to take
Kinshasa succeeds,'' Yerodia told reporters.
	   Matadi was the last major town in Congo's southwest controlled
by a rebel coalition that won a string of stunning successes early
in the month-old uprising against Kabila, whom the rebels have
accused of corruption and tribalism.
	   With the help of allied Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian forces,
Kabila's loyalist troops have regained ground nearly as quickly as
it was lost. The rebels are widely believed to be backed by
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, although both countries have denied
involvement.
	   The capital Kinshasa was quiet Sunday after days of pitched
combat on its western and eastern suburbs left bodies scattered
through the streets and triggered a vicious spree of lynching and
summary executions.
	   Responding to complaints from foreign ambassadors in Kinshasa,
Yerodia defended his military's conduct.
	   ``The reality of this situation is that the front is
everywhere,'' he said. ``The aggressors are hiding in houses and
back alleys in all quarters. If there are fronts everywhere in
Kinshasa, there is war everywhere.''
	   The charred corpses of suspected rebels lie along some streets
in downtown Kinshasa.
	   Officials say hundreds and perhaps thousands of rebel fighters
have surrendered or been killed in the past few days of fighting.
	   The rebels, however, say they are not finished.
	   The insurgent coalition force of ethnic Tutsis and former
Congolese soldiers still control key cities in the country's east,
including Goma, Bukavu and Kisangani.
	   Yerodia said a key power dam at the town Inga, southwest of
Kinshasa, had been recaptured by Congo's allies, although
electricity to the capital had not yet been restored.
	   ``This is due to a technical fault,'' Deputy Interior Minister
Faustin Munene said in a state radio broadcast.
	   Rebel leader Jean-Pierre Ondekane remained defiant.
	   ``They say the war is over but I say the war in not finished,''
said Ondekane. ``We're in Kinshasa fighting. The situation is going
well.''
	   Rebel troops slipped past government defenses in various parts
of Kinshasa last week and launched an attack for the airport and
the city's eastern outskirts.
	   Government, Angolan and Zimbabwean troops searched door-to-door
Sunday in search of insurgent forces hiding amid the population,
Yerodia said.
	   Kabila, meanwhile, flew to Zimbabwe, where he was expected to
thank the country for sending troops.
	   Kabila won the support of several neighboring countries after
insisting the Congolese rebellion was in fact an invasion by Rwanda
and Uganda.
	   Rwanda's Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana on Sunday criticized
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia for helping Kabila, who he accused of
training 10,000 Rwandan rebel soldiers bidding to unseat Rwanda's
government.
	   Rwanda has repeatedly threatened to intervene in the conflict to
protect its vital interests in the turbulent eastern border region
of Congo.
	   Gasana made the comments in South Africa, where he is attending
a summit of Non-Aligned Movement member states.
	   The heads of state from 51 members of the Non-Aligned Movement
were meeting in South Africa, where the conflict in Congo was to be
discussed.

At Nonaligned Summit: Rwanda accuses Congo of training rebels
</HEADLINE>
against Rwanda &QL; 
 &UR; With Congo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Rwanda's foreign minister alleged
Sunday that Congo has trained 10,000 soldiers to unseat the East
African country's government.
	   Repeating past allegations, Gasana Anastase spoke at a press
conference at the Nonaligned Movement summit, a gathering of 113
member states that opened Saturday.
	   Much of the summit's work takes place behind closed doors, and
the delegates were expected to gather Sunday to consider an
application by Congo to censure Rwanda and Uganda for alleged
aggression on its territory.
	   Congo's President Laurent Kabila has accused his two neighbors
of supporting an armed rebellion launched by a coalition of Tutsis
and disaffected Congolese soldiers four weeks ago. Both Rwanda and
Uganda have denied involvement.
	   Anastase's public charges against Congo set an openly
confrontational tone for the summit's second day. Escalated tension
brewing over the insurrection in Congo has already drawn five
southern and eastern African countries into the fray since early
August.
	   Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola, whose presidents are expected to
attend the summit, have sent troops to back Kabila.
	   Anastase claimed that Kabila is training Rwandan refugees of an
ethnic Hutu background to unseat Rwanda's Tutsi ethnic majority
government just across its eastern border.
	   Just last year the roles were reversed as Rwanda backed Kabila's
drive to unseat the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled the
former Zaire, and oust Hutu refugees.
	   ``He tried to cheat on his alliance,'' Anastase said. ``These
(troops he is training) are the people who committed genocide in
Rwanda in 1994.''
	   Congo state radio has exhorted citizens to massacre ethnic
Tutsis, Amnesty International has reported.
	   Resolution of the Congo crisis was expected to be a major agenda
issue for the summit, along with India and Pakistan's nuclear
disagreements and economic issues.
	   Other issues expected on the agenda included Indonesia's
proposal for tighter regulation of global financial and currency
markets. Indonesia and other Asian countries have particularly
suffered from market instability.

 &UR; Eds: RESTORES 1st reference to Yeltsin &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A chronology of events in Russia during the past
eight days:
	   Sunday, Aug. 23 _ President Boris Yeltsin fires Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko and reinstates Viktor Chernomyrdin as acting prime
minister.
	   Monday, Aug. 24 _ Yeltsin says he brought Chernomyrdin back
because he needed a ``heavyweight'' to tackle the burgeoning
economic crisis. Reformer Boris Nemtsov quits as first deputy prime
minister. Value of the ruble falls to 7.14 to the dollar (14 cents)
from 6.29 (16 cents) a week earlier.
	   Tuesday, Aug. 25 _ Ruble falls 9.2 percent to close at 7.86
(12.7 cents), biggest one-day plunge in nearly four years. Currency
trading suspended twice when banks overwhelmed by demand for
dollars.
	   Wednesday, Aug. 26 _ Central bank cancels already-agreed dollar
sales for first time. Government fails to make payments on
longer-term debt previously unaffected by the crisis. Ruble falls 5
percent to 8.26 to dollar (12.1 cents).
	   Thursday, Aug. 27 _ Opposition demands that Yeltsin resign,
drafts power-sharing agreement and package of Soviet-style economic
measures to reverse reforms.
	   Friday, Aug. 28 _ Yeltsin goes on national television to declare
he won't resign. Currency trades suspended for third straight day,
but stocks rise slightly in light trading. Ruble's street hovers
below 10 to the dollar (10 cents).
	   Saturday, Aug. 29 _ Chernomyrdin begins negotiating
power-sharing agreement with parliament, declares that Russia will
not return to a Soviet-style economy. Ruble's street value rises
slightly, is mostly above 10 to the dollar (10 cents).
	   Sunday, Aug. 30 _ The interim government and parliamentary
leaders agree to an 18-month truce that would leave Yeltsin in
control and give the administration time to try to end the crisis.

<TEXT>
	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ Britain's Damon Hill won a
chaotic Belgian Grand Prix Sunday, braving a rainstorm that caused
one of the biggest pile-ups in Formula One history and saw
hotheaded Michael Schumacher crash out with victory beckoning.
	   World standings leader Mika Hakkinen spun out on the opening
hairpin and Schumacher seemed poised to take over the championship
lead until he hit the back of Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes teammate
David Coulthard, blinded by a sheet of spray. He was leading by
half a minute at the time.
	   It allowed Hill, the 1996 world champion, to won his first Grand
Prix in two seasons and gave the Jordan team its first ever
victory. It was Hill's third win on Formula One's most challenging
circuit. Ralf Schumacher made it an incredible one-two finish for
Jordan-Mugen Honda, which had a terrible start to the season.
	   Hill completed the 44 laps around the 6.968-kilometer
(4.329-mile) circuit in one hour, 43 minutes 47.407 second, at an
average speed of 177.229 kilometers an hour. Ralf Schumacher
finished 0.932 seconds behind. Veteran Frenchman Jean Alesi drove
his Sauber-Petronas into third place, 7.240 seconds back.
	   ``It is a fantastic result,'' said Hill after greeting the
British Union Jack flags near the finish area. ``Now, we'll go out
to celebrate.''
	   Celebration was the farthest thing on anyone's mind just three
hours earlier.
	   A dozen of the 22 cars slammed into each other in the downhill
straight just after the opening La Source hairpin. Coulthard was in
third position when his car suddenly veered into the protective
wall and bounced back onto the track.
	   Blinded by spray coming off the leading cars, driver after
driver crashed into a wall of wrecks, tires and debris. Amazingly,
all drivers were able to walk away from the smoke and twisted
metal.
	   ``I saw nothing ... I couldn't stop,'' French driver Olivier
Panis said. His car was a total wreck.
	   The race resumed nearly one hour later and Hakkinen started slow
off pole position and already had Schumacher breathing down his
neck at La Source. The Finn could not hold his line on the hairpin
and, with Schumacher nudging his car, he spun. Johnny Herbert
slammed into the McLaren and Hakkinen's race was over after about
10 seconds.
	   Schumacher moved past early leader Hill and with brilliant
wet-weather driving, he dominated until the 25th lap when he
prepared to lap Coulthard. The German miscalculated Coulthard's
speed and in near-invisibility, he slammed into the back the
McLaren, and lost his right frontwheel and any chance of victory.
	   Both drivers slumped to the pits and an outraged Schumacher
marched over to the McLaren stand to challenge Coulthard, accusing
him of reckless driving. Schumacher had to be restrained before he
could reach the Scot.
	   ``You want to kill me,'' Schumacher shouted.
	   The McLaren team denied Coulthard deliberately tried to get
Schumacher out of the race and said he slowed down to let the
German pass. The sudden shift of speed surprised Schumacher.
	   Schumacher said he had been chasing Coulthard for 1 1/2 laps and
always found the Scot closing the door on him. Then, suddenly,
Coulthard slowed down.
	   ``I didn't have any chance and banged into him,'' Schumacher
said afterwards. He clutched both hands to his head, considering he
could have easily become the world championship leader.
	   Coulthard said the conditions were so atrocious the race should
have been slowed by a safety car much earlier.
	   With both Hakkinen and Schumacher out, the Finn held on to his
77-70 edge in the standings with only three races remaining on the
calendar.
	   With the championship leaders back in the pits, this season's
lesser gods took over and didn't disappoint. With four laps to go,
Hill, Ralf Schumacher and Alesi were within three seconds of each
other the thrilling race captivated the over 120,000 spectators up
to the end.
	   Accidents dominated the whole weekend.
	   On Friday, reigning world champion Jacques Villeneuve lost
control of his Williams-Mecachrome on the famed Eau-Rouge corner at
some 290 kilometers an hour (180 mph) and crashed backward into a
protective tire barrier. He was not hurt.
	   On Saturday, the infamous Eau Rouge corner claimed yet another
crash victim.
	   Finland's Mika Salo lost control of his Arrows-Yamaha at almost
the exact same uphill spot during morning practice and his car
slammed at high speed into protective tires before spinning four
times on the track and coming to a standstill.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Communist Party said Sunday it would not agree
to a deal with President Boris Yeltsin that would impose a

Owen wrecks Gullit's debut at Newcastle; Liverpool wins 4-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Gullit quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ So much for the glamor of new coach
Ruud Gullit arriving and changing Newcastle's dismal, early season
start.
	   Liverpool, behind three goals in 15 minutes by 18-year-old
England international Michael Owen _ two in 85 seconds early in the
game _ drubbed Newcastle 4-1 Sunday in England's Premier League.
	   The victory moved Liverpool into first place with seven points,
the same as Aston Villa but superior on goal difference. Nottingham
Forest is third with six points.
	   Gullit, who was named in a shock announcement Thursday to
replace Kenny Dalglish, jotted notes and watched the match
impassively from the grandstand in the first half.
	   He could not have liked what he saw, particularly from a chaotic
defense.
	   The 38,000 sellout came to St. James' Park for a party, hoping
to see wide-open, imaginative soccer. They did _ from Liverpool _
as the Magpies added an abysmal loss to two lackluster draws under
Dalglish.
	   Liverpool sliced up Newcastle's defense, attacking relentlessly
in the first half hour with Owen scoring almost at will.
	   He struck in the 17th, driving home a rebound from eight meters
(yards) off a Paul Ince shot. Moments later in the 18th, he got a
pass from Steve McManaman and again scored from eight meters
(yards).
	   Newcastle's French international Stephane Guivarc'h stemmed the
flow in the 28th, scoring his first of the season from 10 meters
(yards) as his shot went in off the goalpost to the left of
Liverpool's American goalkeeper Brad Friedel.
	   But Owen struck again in the 32nd for his fourth of the season,
this time dribbling through two defenders and then chipping it home
from 10 meters.
	   Czech forward Patrik Berger added a fourth just seconds from
halftime as he scored on a left-footed drive from 18 meters.
	   Gullit moved to the bench for the second half as Newcastle
looked more poised, although Liverpool didn't press its advantage.
	   ``At least we played on their half and created some chances, but
still not enough,'' Gullit said of the second half. ``But at least
it's a start.
	   ``I knew that it was going to be like this, but I just wanted to
see it with my own eyes,'' he added. ``It will take some time to do
something about it.''
	   Rumors have suggested striker Alan Shearer may not be in
Gullit's plans. Gullit admitted every player was on trial.
	   ``You have to see which players can cope with it and which
not,'' he said.
	   On Saturday, Aston Villa took a 1-0 victory at Sheffield
Wednesday on a goal in the 37th by Julian Joachim.
	   Nottingham Forest, on the third weekend of the season, defeated
Southampton 2-1. For Southampton, it was a third loss in three
games, leaving it last in the 20-team league.
	   Newly promoted Charlton, the surprise team of the early season,
held defending league and F.A. Cup champions Arsenal to a 0-0 draw
at the Gunners' north London stadium.
	   Arsenal had to settle for the draw when French international
Emmanuel Petit was sent off in the 58th minute after picking up his
second yellow card.
	   Despite the draw, Charlton _ the leaders after two weeks _
stayed in fourth place tied with four other clubs with five points:
Wimbledon, Arsenal, Leeds and West Ham.
	   Everton remained without a goal in three games, losing 1-0 to
Tottenham, another troubled side that had dropped its first two
games with coach Christian Gross's job clearly on the line.
	   In other games Saturday in the Premier League: Blackburn 1,
Leicester 0; Coventry 0, West Ham 0; Middlesbrough 1, Derby 1;
Wimbledon 1, Leeds 1.
	   In England's first division Saturday: Birmingham 0, Barnsley 0;
Bolton 2, Sheffield United 2; Huddersfield 3, Portsmouth 3; Oxford
United 0, Grimsby 0; Queens Park Rangers 0, Bury 0; Stockport 1,
Crystal Palace 1; Swindon 1, Port Vale 1; Tranmere 1, Bristol City
1; West Brom 2, Norwich 0.
	   In Scotland on Sunday, Kilmarnock defeated Hearts 3-0 and

	   PARIS (AP) _ All it takes is rain at high altitude and the
popular slopes of Mont Blanc, Europe's highest mountain, turn into
a treacherous wall of ice.
	   In seven days, 15 climbers have fallen to their deaths, many of
them plunging several hundred meters (yards.) The scenario is the
same almost every summer, and authorities in the popular resort are
once again urging climbers to be extra vigilant.
	   The latest death was on Sunday, when a 25-year-old woman from
Poland fell while climbing the Mont Maudit peak in the Mont Blanc
range.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Aviation experts began Sunday sifting
through the charred remains of a Cuban commercial airplane to look
for clues about why it burst into flames during takeoff and crashed
high in the Andes mountains, killing 78 people.
	   Red Cross workers dug through the charred wreckage for
survivors, while firefighters sprayed jets of waters on the smoking
ruins to prevent further explosions.
	   At least 22 passengers reportedly survived Saturday's crash.
	   ``Before we heard the roar of the crash, we felt the plane rise
a bit and burst in flames. There were three explosions,'' one of
the survivors, Hernan Boada, 27, of Cuba told a Channel 10
television station. ``I saw other people wrapped in flames jump
from the plane.''
	   The Russian-made Tupolev 154 aircraft owned by Cubana de
Aviacion burst into flames Saturday during takeoff and slammed into
two homes, clipped the top of a auto mechanic's workshop and a
soccer field located 200 yards (180 meters) beyond the end of the
runway at Quito's International Airport.
	   Five children who were playing outside their homes or watching a
soccer game near the soccer games were killed, relatives and
witnesses said.
	   The nose and front part of the plane disintegrated in the crash.
	   The jetliner barely missed a heavily traveled avenue at the end
of the airport runway in a middle-class residential neighborhood
9,300 feet (2,835 meters) above sea level. It was en route first to
Guayaquil, on the Ecuadorean coast, then to Havana.
	   Cuba's official Prensa Latina news agency said Sunday that a
team of experts from Cuba's civilian aeronautics agency had arrived
in Quito to help in the investigation.
	   Alvaro Martinez of Chile, who survived the crash with minor
injuries, said that even though the engine made a loud sound before
takeoff, the pilot insisted on flying the plane.
	   ``This is a case of professional negligence that should be
condemned internationally. It is not possible that a pilot that
knows his plane has problems attempts to take off,'' he said.
	   Gen. Osvaldo Dominguez, director of the Civil Aviation Office,
said two out of three engines were in reverse, but would not
comment further on the causes of the accident until the
investigation has concluded.
	   The entire 14-person crew died in the crash. Two stewardesses
helped passengers escape from the burning plane but were enveloped
by the fire before they could escape, survivors told local
newspapers.
	   Dominguez said 78 people died in the crash. Nine of those were
people on the ground _ including the five children. Dominguez also
said 19 foreigners died, including Cubans, Chileans, Italians,
Spaniards, one Argentine and one Jamaican.

Muralitharan sends England on a spin

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score &QL; 
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan bowled Sri Lanka
to a stranglehold of the one-off test against England on the fourth
day at the Oval Sunday.
	   England, trailing by 146 runs in the first innings, crawled to
54 for two off 42 overs, still needing 92 runs to avoid the
ignominy of an innings defeat.
	   Sri Lanka, rallied around a brilliant 213 by opener Sanath
Jayasuriya and a fine 152 by Aravinda de Silva to score a
formidable 591 in its first innings.
	   This was after England, sent into bat, had scored 445 thanks to
centuries by Graeme Hick and John Crawley.
	   Muralitharan, who tormented England's first innings with 7-115,
removed Mark Butcher and Hick in the space of three balls to have
the home side struggling on 25 for two.
	   But skipper Alec Stewart and Steve James, played out 155 testing
deliveries in 86 minutes between them to save the day for England.
	   Stewart, was involved in a furious exchange of words with
wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana, before umpire David Shepherd
intervened and calmed things down.
	   Muralitharan, playing in his 42nd test, drew Butcher (15) out
with a well flighted delivery and Kaluwitharana completed an
outstanding stumping.
	   With the second ball of his next over, Muralitharan, trapped
Hick (0), leg before wicket with a ball that kept low and turned
sharply.
	   Muralitharan, has taken 196 wickets with his nine-wicket haul so
far, and another four will make him only the second off spinner
since West Indian Lance Gibbs to take 200 test wickets. Gibbs, took
309 wickets in 79 tests.
	   Muralitharan, who took five wickets in Sri Lanka's only test win
over England, six years ago in Colombo, took 2-16 in 18 overs, and
a match-bag of 9-131, a record for Sri Lanka against the home side.
	   Earlier, Muralitharan helped Suresh Perera add an invaluable 59
runs for the last wicket to put the game beyond England's reach.
	   The tailenders Perera and Muttiah Muralitharan, frustrated
England for almost an hour after Sri Lanka had lost its way
following a lower-order collapse.
	   Perera, the 20-year old debutant, hit an unbeaten 43 while
Muralitharan, used the long handle to score 30 off 36 balls with
five boundaries.
	   The pair came together after medium paceman Angus Fraser had
grabbed 2-1 in 11 balls after lunch.
	   Perera's innings included a straight driven six off Fraser and
six sweetly timed boundaries.
	   Sri Lanka, resuming on 446 for three, got off to a disastrously,
losing skipper Arjuna Ranatunga (51) and Hashan Tillakaratne (0) to
medium paceman Darren Gough off successive balls.
	   But De Silva, uncharacteristically subdued throughout his 17th
test century, was joined by Kaluwitharana (25) and briefly repaired
the damages with a 38-run stand for the sixth wicket.
	   De Silva, playing ion his 74th test, reached his 150, but four
balls later, edged a Ben Hollioake outswinger to wicketkeeper
Stewart.
	   De Silva, batted for 42 minutes over seven hours and shared two
important stands _ a record 243 for the third with Jayasuriya, and
122 with Ranatunga for the fourth wicket. He hit 17 boundaries off
292 balls.
	   Ranatunga's innings included seven boundaries and a six while
Kaluwitharana hit two fours in his 58-minute stay at the crease.
	   Fraser was the pick of the bowlers with 3-95 while Gough,
Hollioake and Cork took two wickets apiece.

	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ Britain's Damon Hill won a
chaotic Belgian Grand Prix Sunday, braving a rainstorm that caused
one of the biggest pile-ups in Formula One history and saw
hotheaded Michael Schumacher crash out with victory beckoning.
	   World standings leader Mika Hakkinen spun out on the opening
hairpin and Schumacher seemed poised to take over the championship
lead until he hit the back of Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes teammate
David Coulthard, blinded by a sheet of spray. He was leading by
half a minute at the time.
	   It allowed Hill, the 1996 world champion, to win his first Grand
Prix in two seasons and gave the Jordan team its first ever
victory. It was Hill's third win on Formula One's most challenging
circuit. Ralf Schumacher made it an incredible one-two finish for
Jordan-Mugen Honda, overcoming a terrible start to the season.
	   Hill completed the 44 laps around the 6.968-kilometer
(4.329-mile) circuit in one hour, 43 minutes 47.407 second, at an
average speed of 177.229 kilometers an hour. Ralf Schumacher
finished 0.932 seconds behind. Veteran Frenchman Jean Alesi drove
his Sauber-Petronas into third place, 7.240 seconds back.
	   ``It is a fantastic result,'' said Hill after greeting the
British Union Jack flags near the finish area. ``Now, we'll go out
to celebrate.''
	   Celebration was the farthest thing on anyone's mind just three
hours earlier.
	   A dozen of the 22 cars slammed into each other in the downhill
straight just after the opening La Source hairpin. Coulthard was in
third position when his car suddenly veered into the protective
wall and bounced back onto the track.
	   Blinded by spray coming off the leading cars, driver after
driver crashed into a wall of wrecks, tires and debris. Amazingly,
all drivers were able to walk away from the smoke and twisted
metal.
	   ``I saw nothing ... I couldn't stop,'' French driver Olivier
Panis said. His car was a total wreck.
	   The race resumed nearly one hour later and Hakkinen started slow
off pole position and already had Schumacher breathing down his
neck at La Source. The Finn could not hold his line on the hairpin
and, with Schumacher nudging his car, he spun. Johnny Herbert
slammed into the McLaren and Hakkinen's race was over after about
10 seconds.
	   Schumacher moved past early leader Hill and with brilliant
wet-weather driving, he dominated until the 25th lap when he
prepared to lap Coulthard. The German miscalculated Coulthard's
speed and in near-invisibility, he slammed into the back the
McLaren, and lost his right frontwheel and any chance of victory.
	   Both drivers slumped to the pits and an outraged Schumacher
marched over to the McLaren stand to challenge Coulthard, accusing
him of reckless driving. Schumacher had to be restrained.
	   ``You want to kill me,'' Schumacher shouted.
	   The McLaren team denied Coulthard deliberately tried to get
Schumacher out of the race and said he slowed down to let the
German pass. The sudden shift of speed surprised Schumacher.
	   Schumacher said he had been chasing Coulthard for 1 1/2 laps and
always found the Scot closing the door on him. Then, suddenly,
Coulthard slowed down.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Eastern and Western Christians and
other religious leaders from some 50 countries gathered Sunday in
this former Communist capital, attempting to cast aside discord and
fight for peace and tolerance.
	   But the three-day meeting was overshadowed by divisions within
the World Council of Churches, the Orthodox Churches and a church
dispute in Romania.
	   The head of Orthodoxy, Bartholomew I, and the Russian Patriarch
Alexei II were conspicuously absent from the conference. Before it
started, questions were raised about its timing.
	   Last fall, the Bulgarian, Georgian and Serbian Orthodox Churches
left the World Council of Churches, protesting against Protestants
groups, who they claim have compromised Christianity by showing too
much tolerance towards homosexuals.
	   The Romanian Orthodox Church's relations with its Russian
counterpart are strained over the Moldovan Church, which was part
of the Romanian church before World War II when Moldova and Romania
were united. But after 1991, when Moldova declared independence,
its Orthodox believers stayed under Moscow's tutelage.
	   In addition, relations between the Orthodox centers in Istanbul
and Moscow turned sour in 1996 when the small Estonian Orthodox
Church asked to go under Istanbul's protection. This reportedly
angered Russian Patriarch Alexei II, who is an ethnic Estonian.
	   In Romania itself, the disagreement is over church property
Eastern Rite Catholics request to be returned from the Orthodox
Church.
	   However, Romania's President Emil Constantinescu, who is seen as
wanting to promote Romania as a regional power by hosting the
meeting, appealed Sunday to church and other leaders to avoid
imposing their own political, cultural and religious values.
	   ``It is more reasonable to identify the evil we all fight
against,'' he said, citing terrorism, war, famine, racism and
discrimination as the ills of the contemporary world.
	   The interdenominational gathering, comprising Christians,
Muslims, Buddhists and Jews, was preceded earlier in the day by an
open-air Orthodox church service.
	   Israel's Chief Rabbi Meir Lau, eight Catholic cardinals and
Islamic leaders are among those in attendance.
	   American Sister Helen Prejean, whose opposition to the death
penalty was portrayed by Susan Sarandon in the film ``Dead Man
Walking,'' will give a talk. Sarandon won an Oscar for her role.
	   Critics noted several other Orthodox Church leaders stayed away,
and Protestants were thin on the ground. In addition to Peter VII,
the only other heads of national Orthodox Churches were Romanian
Patriarch Teoctist and Patriarch Chrysostomos of Cyprus.
	   One of the aims of the conference is to set the stage for a
visit by Pope John Paul II, who was invited by Constantinescu to
come to Romania in May 1999.
	   However, the papal visit requires the blessing of the Romanian
Orthodox Church, who has set certain conditions. Almost 90 percent
of Romanians adhere to the Orthodox creed.
	   The Orthodox want Romania's 300,000-strong Eastern Rite
Catholics, the country's second largest church, to drop demands for
the return of hundreds of churches seized by the Communists and
given to the Orthodox in 1948.
	   There are about 300 million Orthodox believers worldwide.

Tom River swaggered way to title

	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ A five-homer game in the
Little League World Series?
	   No big deal, Todd Frazier says.
	   ``I thought we had it in us,'' Frazier said after the New Jersey
team beat Kashima, Japan, 12-9, Saturday to win its first series.
``I thought _ ''
	   ``Don't lie, Todd,'' manager Mike Gaynor broke in with a grin.
	   ``I did!'' Frazier insisted.
	   ``Well, I'm glad you were confident,'' Gaynor said.
	   These 11- and 12-year-old New Jerseyans exuded that kind of
swagger all week as they went 5-0 and hit 10 home runs. Even quiet
reserve Chris Cardone caught it, hitting home runs in consecutive
at-bats Saturday, including the game-deciding shot in the sixth
inning.
	   After their second victory lap _ one came when they won the U.S.
title _ talking about their conquests became second nature.
	   The run started with the longest game in World Series by innings
(11) and time (3 hours, 11 minutes). They scored four runs in the
final inning to put away Jenison, Mich., 13-9, then returned the
next night and defeated Cypress, California, 4-2 on Gabe Gardner's
three-run shot.
	   They beat Greenville, North Carolina, twice in the next three
days to reach the final, the second time with ace Scott Fisher on
the mound. He won two games with a 1.00 ERA.
	   Frazier was in the middle of all of it: He batted 9-for-15,
including 4-for-4 in the final, hit four home runs and he won two
games on the mound, giving up just three earned runs. A
sixth-inning, two-out homer against Greenville sealed the U.S.
title.
	   ``I got my home run ball right here,'' he said on Saturday,
``and it just means everything to me.''
	   Frazier finished the championship game _ an 11-homer affair _ by
holding the Japanese to two hits in the final two innings and
striking out the last batter. He limited Kashima's Tetsuya Furukawa
to a single and struck out Tatsuya Sugata _ two batters who went a
combined 7-for-8 with five solo home runs.
	   ``We had quite a few home runs and some good hitting, but we
just did not have the men on,'' Kashima manager Atsushi Ohkawa
said.
	   For Frazier and Casey Gaynor, the win gave them family bragging
rights. Both had older brothers who played in the 1995 World
Series. That Toms River team went 1-2.
	   Gaynor and his dad, the manager, came up with a few T-shirt
ideas just to rub it in.
	   To give Colin, his 15-year-old brother, a shirt reading ``I'm
Casey's Brother.'' And for the rest of the family, a ``Colin Who?''
shirt.
	   This week brings a Labor Day parade, maybe a pizza party at
Mugsy's in Toms River (``My mom knows the owner,'' Fisher said) and
_ ugh _ school.
	   Frazier wasn't too upset about returning to classes though.
	   ``I think a lot of guys are going to recognize us and say `Hi,'
'' he guessed.

	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares
was among the first in line Sunday to vote on whether to reform the
constitution to allow him to seek re-election.
	   Supporters say the change would ensure political stability
during next year's handover of the Panama Canal and U.S. military
land. Opponents say it's an attempt to put friends of the ruling
Democratic Revolutionary Party in the best position to win land
development contracts.
	   Early in the steamy, tropical morning, Perez Balladares and his
wife, Dora, voted at a Panama City primary school shortly after
polls opened.
	   ``We all have the right ... (and) civic obligation to send our
opinion, to decide the future of Panama,'' he said after casting
his ballot.
	   Panama's constitution restricts the president to one five-year
term, and re-election is only possible if a leader sits out two
terms. The next president will be elected in May and take office in
September, three months before the U.S. government turns over the
canal and U.S. military bases.
	   The pro-reform side spent millions of dollars on television and
radio commercials and ``Si'' flags, T-shirts and banners. A huge
street party Friday night drew tens of thousands of Panamanians.
	   But Rosa de Olive, who voted at the same school as the
president, was confident the proposed reform would lose.
	   ``Propaganda always does damage,'' she said.
	   Teams of foreign observers were dispatched across the Central
American nation to monitor voting. The opposition warned of
potential fraud.
	   Presidential candidate Mireya Moscoso of the Arnulfista Party
showed reporters she could easily wash off ink that is used to
stain voters' fingers to prevent repeat voting.
	   Immediately after casting her ballot, she dipped her finger in a
water-chlorine mixture and wiped it clean.
	   A high portion of Panama's more than 1.7 million registered
voters was expected to turn out before the more than 2,000 polling
stations closed at 2100 GMT.
	   Reform supporters hoped stormy skies would keep `No' voters at
home, and in the morning, a heavy rain poured on the capital.
Pro-reform groups also organized free transportation for voters who
needed to return to their home districts in the country's interior.
	   Observers from the Organization of American States raised
concern about the fairness of the service, but Perez Balladares
said it had been organized privately.
	   Reform opponents fear allowing the president to seek a
successive term would weaken democracy, which took hold just nine
years ago after U.S. forces toppled the regime of Gen. Manuel
Noriega.
	   Opposition leaders say Panama's system of checks-and-balances is
too weak to keep an autocrat from holding onto power.
	   They said Panama should not to follow the steps of Peru, where
Congress' decision to allow President Alberto Fujimori to seek a
third term set off violent protests last week.
	   Many Panamanians say Perez Balladares _ who won office with just
33 percent of the vote in 1994 _ has not done enough to help poor
Panamanians.
	   Industry and agricultural workers say they have been left behind
by the administration's push to modernize the service sector. More
than 40 percent of Panama's 2.6 million people live below the
poverty level of dlrs 228 a month for a family of five.

British diplomat resigns, angry with Britons on holiday in Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IBIZA, Spain (AP) _ Annoyed at the behavior of his fellow
countrymen on holiday, Britain's vice-consul on the tourist resort
island of Ibiza said Sunday that he was quitting.
	   Michael Birkett, 51, was reluctant to talk about his decision to
resign until Tuesday, when he will have left his post, he said from
his home in Ibiza, where for the past 18 months he has dealt with
such problems as crime, drug overdoses and traffic accidents.
	   In London, a Foreign Office spokeswoman, speaking with customary
anonymity, said: ``He put in his resignation three weeks ago and it
was accepted. ... We wouldn't discuss the reason.''
	   Birkett himself was quoted by the British news agency Press
Association as saying that he was quitting over the ``degenerate''
behavior of young Britons who come to the island in search of sun,
sex, drugs and alcohol.
	   ``Basically I am sick of the behavior of some of the, mainly
young, British tourists who come here, and of clearing up the mess
they cause,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Birkett previously worked as an accountant at the British
Embassy in Madrid.
	   Ibiza, one of the three Balearic islands is a favorite
destination for European tourists, including a large number of
Britons.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A tentative agreement to approve a new government
under Boris Yeltsin to tackle Russia's political crisis appeared to
collapse within hours Sunday after the Communists said they would
not accept the deal.
	   The Communist turnabout came just after the government and the
opposition said they had reached a deal following days of tough
behind-the-scenes bargaining to call a political truce.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zuganov said the proposed pact was
rejected by a meeting of his party leadership because there was no
firm guarantee Yeltsin would abide by its provisions. But he did
not rule out further talks.
	   ``So far the document is not guaranteeing anybody anything,'' he
said, adding that the party would vote Monday against the
confirmation of acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in
parliamentary hearings.
	   The Communists' surprise rejection of the deal could be a
prelude to more bargaining as the opposition seeks further
concessions. Russia may face weeks of political uncertainty if the
opposition blocks Chernomyrdin's confirmation and Yeltsin refuses
to withdraw it.
	   Chernomyrdin said earlier that swift formation of a new
government was vital to tackle the nation's economic crisis.
	   ``We must resolve financial problems. The ruble is hanging by a
thread,'' he said. ``So if we have a political agreement and the
president accepts it _ let's start working.''
	   The proposed three-page agreement would have given the State
Duma, parliament's lower house, more say in Cabinet appointments,
but leave Yeltsin with substantial power, despite earlier
opposition calls for his removal.
	   In particular, the president would have retained control of the
security forces with the right to fill three key posts _ the
defense, foreign and interior ministries. In exchange, Yeltsin
would have agreed to Duma approval of most Cabinet appointments for
the first time, according to lawmakers and media reports.
	   The draft, which was not made public, would also have obliged
both sides to maintain a political truce. The Duma would not try to
vote the government out of power until parliament's term ends in
late 1999, while Yeltsin would not use his right to dissolve the
legislature _ although he apparently would not lose this power.
	   But the deal was on paper only and Yeltsin would have retained
his powers to dissolve the Duma.
	   Russia was plunged into political and economic crisis when
financial markets and the currency collapsed as the government
defaulted on its debts and the country was hit by the global furor
in developing markets. Ordinary Russians fear they face yet more
hardships after years of upheaval, but there have been few signs of
panic on the streets of Moscow and other cities.
	   The ruble appeared to gain Sunday and exchange points across
Moscow were buying U.S. dollars at an average 8 rubles (12.5
cents), down from an average 8.5 (11.7 cents) the day before. The
rate had been 6 rubles to the dollar (16.6 cents) before the
collapse.
	   There had been no immediate confirmation that Yeltsin would
accept the deal, even though it left him with a firm grip on power.
But he appeared reluctant to accept many of the provisions,
according to Russia media.
	   Yeltsin's parliament envoy Alexander Kotenkov gave the proposed
pact to the president at his country home outside Moscow. If
Yeltsin were to reject the document, it could trigger a new battle
for power with the Duma.
	   ``It's too early to speak about the final fate of the draft
political agreement,'' Kotenkov said cautiously. ``If anybody
thinks it'll be an easy decision for the president, they're
wrong.''
	   There was no word on an economic plan that had been discussed
with the opposition to handle the crisis. It called for imposing
some Soviet-style economic controls, but Chernomyrdin said Saturday
there was no question of restoring the Soviet system.
	   While Yeltsin would lose some power under the deal, it appeared
to represent a major step down by the hard-line opposition, which
had been calling for the president's removal and formal power
sharing. Yeltsin said last week he would never resign.
	   ``Maybe we would have liked some sections of the documents to be
tougher,'' admitted Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is speaker
of the State Duma.
	   Zyuganov called for unspecified changes to the International
Monetary Fund's terms for extending a dlrs 22.6 billion loan to
Russia. The Communists also called for formation of a
Constitutional Assembly, a new body that would take over ``if the
situation gets out of control'' and tighter controls on Yeltsin's
powers to nominate a prime minister.
	   The opposition also fears criticism from its own supporters if
it is seen to agree swiftly to a deal with Yeltsin.
	   Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back as prime minister a week ago
because he hoped the familiar figure would restore confidence in
the government, badly damaged by the ruble's sharp decline.

AEK beats Apollon to share lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Star striker Demis Nikolaidis scored two
goals Sunday as AEK Athens beat crosstown Apollon 3-1 to share the
prime position of the Greek first division soccer league.
	   But the round was marred by incidents when PAOK and Aris fans,
both from Salonica, clashed soon after the end of their game
Saturday.
	   Four days after its promotion to the Champions League, defending
champion Olympiakos Piraeus was disappointingly held to a 1-1 draw
at home Sunday by Panelefsiniakos Elefsis, a club advanced to the
first division this season.
	   In another game, Panathinaikos Athens beat Proodeftiki of
Korydalos 2-1 away.
	   After two rounds, AEK, Aris, Ionikos Nikea and Panathinaikos are
atop the standings with six points each.
	   Christos Maladenis gave AEK the lead in the 5th minute, but
Panayiotis Lahanas levelled for Apollon four minutes later.
	   Nikolaidis put his team ahead in the 43rd and made the final 3-1
in the 82nd.
	   With a penalty taken by Isaac Almanidis in the 40th. Proodeftiki
led Panathinaikos 1-0.
	   Polish striker Krzysztof Warzycha equalized with a shot from the
edge of the box in the 68th.
	   Ten minutes before the end of the game, Yiannis Goumas scored
the winner with a header off a center from Croatian star Aljosa
Asanovic.
	   Olympiakos sieged the Panelefsiniakos area particularly in the
second half, but the visitors' defense resisted well.
	   Panelefsiniakos took a 1-0 lead with Giorgos Koutsis in the
27th.
	   Stelios Giannacopoulos levelled for Olympiakos off a center from
Grigoris Georgatos three minutes later.
	   Six minutes before the final whistle, Serbian striker Sinisa
Gogic had a shot on Panelefsiniakos' right post.
	   On Saturday, police chased fans outside the stadium after they
clashed soon after the referee marked the end of the game in which
Aris trounced rival PAOK 4-1 away.
	   Officially, one fan and eight policemen were injured. However,
media reported that at least 25 supporters from both teams were
slightly injured, but they avoided going to hospital in order to
avoid arrest.
	   Police said 12 fans were arrested and will be referred to a
public prosecutor to be charged. The clashes led to damages at many
shops and cars around the Toumba stadium, PAOK's home field.
	   The defeat, combined with PAOK's elimination by Glasgow Rangers
from the UEFA cup last week, led the club's administration to
accept Ukrainian coach Oleg Blachin's resignation. Reports said
that Angelos Anastassiadis, the Greek coach whom Blachin replaced
two months ago, may return to his post.

King is queen at world triathlon championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Australia's Joanne King was the
surprise winner at the world triathlon championships Sunday,
narrowly preventing compatriot Michellie Jones from claiming a
record third world title.
	   King completed the 1.5 kilometer (.93 mile) swim, 40 km (24.85
mile) bike ride and 10 km (6.2 mile) running stages in 2 hours, 7
minutes, and 25.3 seconds, frustrating Jones' bid for a third title
in seven years.
	   ``It's a real surprise for me to become world champion,'' said
King, who only took up the sport two years ago. ``I was the last
one chosen for the Australian team and so I was the least expected
to get on the podium.
	   ``My goal was to finish ahead of Jones in the run, my dream was
to finish in the top-five.''
	   Jones, back-to-back champion in 1992-1993, nevertheless improved
on her bronze medal from last year's worlds in Perth, Australia,
claiming the silver in 2:08:03.9.
	   New Zealand's Evelyn Williamson completed a South Pacific sweep
of the podium, finishing third in 2:08:12.2.
	   Loretta Harrop, another Australian, finished fourth, 1:34.7
back, while France's Isabelle Mouthon, second in the ITU points
table, was fifth in 2:09:10.7.
	   Defending champion and ITU World Cup points leader Emma Carney,
also of Australia, had a disasterous race, her hopes for a double
dashed when her gear cable broke midway through the bike stage
	   Jackie Gallagher, a silver medallist at the last worlds, was the
fourth Australian in the top-10, finishing sixth.
	   ``If the Australian's are this strong it's because of our
trainer Brett Sutton,'' said King. ``He works very hard to prepare
us psychologically and physically. He makes sure our heads and legs
are ready for h-hour.''
	   King dedicated her title to Sutton, who she says is the main
reason she can swim a respectable race, when two years ago she
``sank better than I floated.''
	   While King has made considerable progess in the water, it still
isn't her strong suit. The 22-year-old got off to slow start,
finishing 24th after the swim with a 58.2 second deficit.
	   ``The swim was a bit wild at first with so many girls fighting
to get ahead,'' explained King.
	   But a stellar performance in the bike stage brought King back to
within 3.5 seconds of Jones, leading at the start of the run.
	   Even more impressive during the final stage, King surged past
Jones in the final four kilometers, digging a massive lead and
crossing the finishline 38.6 seconds ahead of the former champion.
	   Having earned the classic distance world title, King now plans
to compete at the long-distance world triathlon championships in
Japan next weekend.
	   But King was not ready to discuss anything further than next
weekend, saying the 2000 Sydney Summer Games _ where triathlon
makes its Olympic debut _ is just too unsure.
	   ``It's too early to think about Sydney,'' said King. ``First
you've got to qualify and with the depth of field on the Australian
team, it's not a sure thing I'll be on the team.''
	   Barbara Lindquist, who led after the swim, and Susan Bartolomen
were the top Americans, finishing seventh and eighth respectively.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A tentative agreement to approve a new government
under Boris Yeltsin to tackle Russia's political crisis appeared to
collapse within hours Sunday after the Communists said they would
not accept the deal.
	   The Communist turnabout came just after the government and the
opposition said they had reached a deal following days of tough
behind-the-scenes bargaining to call a political truce.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zuganov said the proposed pact was
rejected by a meeting of his party leadership because there was no
firm guarantee Yeltsin would abide by its provisions. But he did
not rule out further talks.
	   ``So far the document is not guaranteeing anybody anything,'' he
said, adding that the party would vote Monday against the
confirmation of acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in
parliamentary hearings.
	   The nationalist Liberal Democratic Party also said it would not
sign the deal. The social democratic Yabloko party had said from
the start that it wouldn't support Chernmoyrdin's nomination.
	   The Communists' surprise rejection of the deal could be a
prelude to more bargaining as the opposition seeks further
concessions. Russia may face weeks of political uncertainty if the
opposition blocks Chernomyrdin's confirmation and Yeltsin refuses
to withdraw it.
	   Chernomyrdin said earlier that swift formation of a new
government was vital to tackle the nation's economic crisis.
	   ``We must resolve financial problems. The ruble is hanging by a
thread,'' he said. ``So if we have a political agreement and the
president accepts it _ let's start working.''
	   The proposed three-page agreement would have given the State
Duma, parliament's lower house, more say in Cabinet appointments,
but leave Yeltsin with substantial power, despite earlier
opposition calls for his removal.
	   In particular, the president would have retained control of the
security forces with the right to fill three key posts _ the
defense, foreign and interior ministries. In exchange, Yeltsin
would have agreed to Duma approval of most Cabinet appointments for
the first time, according to lawmakers and media reports.
	   The draft, which was not made public, would also have obliged
both sides to maintain a political truce. The Duma would not try to
vote the government out of power until parliament's term ends in
late 1999, while Yeltsin would not use his right to dissolve the
legislature _ although he apparently would not lose this power.
	   But the deal was on paper only and Yeltsin would have retained
his powers to dissolve the Duma.
	   Russia was plunged into political and economic crisis when
financial markets and the currency collapsed as the government
defaulted on its debts and the country was hit by the global furor
in developing markets. Ordinary Russians fear they face yet more
hardships after years of upheaval, but there have been few signs of
panic on the streets of Moscow and other cities.
	   The ruble appeared to gain Sunday and exchange points across
Moscow were buying U.S. dollars at an average 8 rubles (12.5
cents), down from an average 8.5 (11.7 cents) the day before. The
rate had been 6 rubles to the dollar (16.6 cents) before the
collapse.
	   There had been no immediate confirmation that Yeltsin would
accept the deal, even though it left him with a firm grip on power.
But he appeared reluctant to accept many of the provisions,
according to Russia media.
	   Yeltsin's parliament envoy Alexander Kotenkov gave the proposed
pact to the president at his country home outside Moscow. If
Yeltsin were to reject the document, it could trigger a new battle
for power with the Duma.
	   ``It's too early to speak about the final fate of the draft
political agreement,'' Kotenkov said cautiously. ``If anybody
thinks it'll be an easy decision for the president, they're
wrong.''
	   There was no word on an economic plan that had been discussed
with the opposition to handle the crisis. It called for imposing
some Soviet-style economic controls, but Chernomyrdin said Saturday
there was no question of restoring the Soviet system.
	   While Yeltsin would lose some power under the deal, it appeared
to represent a major step down by the hard-line opposition, which
had been calling for the president's removal and formal power
sharing. Yeltsin said last week he would never resign.
	   ``Maybe we would have liked some sections of the documents to be
tougher,'' admitted Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is speaker
of the State Duma.
	   Zyuganov called for unspecified changes to the International
Monetary Fund's terms for extending a dlrs 22.6 billion loan to
Russia. The Communists also called for formation of a
Constitutional Assembly, a new body that would take over ``if the
situation gets out of control'' and tighter controls on Yeltsin's
powers to nominate a prime minister.
	   The opposition also fears criticism from its own supporters if
it is seen to agree swiftly to a deal with Yeltsin.
	   Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back as prime minister a week ago
because he hoped the familiar figure would restore confidence in
the government, badly damaged by the ruble's sharp decline.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A 10-member firing squad wearing
black hoods on Sunday executed two Palestinian policemen who were
convicted of killing two brothers at a wedding as part of the a
longstanding blood feud.
	   In approving the Palestinian Authority's first ever execution,
Yasser Arafat sent a strong signal that abuse of power will not be
tolerated among the 40,000 Palestinians in uniform.
	   Mohammed Abu Sultan, 25 and Raed Abu Sultan, 24, brothers and
members of the Palestinian police force in the Gaza Strip, were
sentenced to death Saturday by a military court for gunning down
two other brothers, Majdi al-Khaldi, 32, and Mohammed al-Khaldi,
30.
	   Arafat approved the sentences Sunday and they were carried out
by masked policemen with AK-47 rifles in the courtyard of the
central Gaza prison.
	   Hassan Asfour, a lawmaker from Gaza and close confidant to
Arafat said the Palestinian leader acted to ensure that no one took
the law into their own hands.
	   ``No one is above the law,'' Asfour told The Associated Press.
	   Sunday's executions were the first carried out by the
Palestinian Authority. In the past, death sentences were commuted
to life in prison on direct orders from Arafat.
	   But the incidents of Palestinian forces using their uniforms to
settle personal scores have begun to mount over the past year.
Dozens of Palestinian police have been convicted of illegally
bursting into homes, making unauthorized arrests of personal
enemies, jailing members of rival clans and taking part in wide
corruption schemes and theft.
	   Israel has also accused Palestinian police of involvement in a
series of violent attacks against Israeli civilians.
	   Both the victims, the al-Khaldi brothers, and the perpetrators,
the Abu Sultan brothers, belonged to the Palestinian security
services.
	   Palestinian human rights activist Bassam Eid condemned the death
penalty and said Arafat had ``no right to confiscate the life of
any Palestinian.''
	   Gaza police chief Ghazi Jabali said the two men asked to pray
before the execution and made a last minute plea for clemency.
	   ``They asked that their sentence be reduced, but the decision
was already made,'' Jabali said. He said that several ministers and
lawmakers were allowed to witness the execution along with members
of the victims' family, who shouted ``Allahu Akbar'' or God is
Great as the firing squad took aim.
	   Three other members of the Abu Sultan family were also sentenced
in the murder, two to life in prison and a third to five years.
	   Sami al-Khaldi, 23, a cousin of the victims, said all five men
should have been executed, fueling speculation that the blood feud
between the families _ started over accusations by the Abu Sultan
brothers that the al-Khaldi brothers were ``looking at the women in
their house,'' _ was not over.
	   But the al-Khaldi family did not open a house of mourning, a
traditional sign that revenge was imminent. And in a move to defuse
tensions, the Abu Sultan family praised Arafat's decision to
executed it's own family members and sent condolences to the
al-Khaldi family through the mosque loudspeaker.

King is queen at world triathlon championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Australia's Joanne King was the
surprise winner at the world triathlon championships Sunday,
narrowly preventing compatriot Michellie Jones from claiming a
record third world title.
	   King completed the 1.5 kilometer (.93 mile) swim, 40 km (24.85
mile) bike ride and 10 km (6.2 mile) running stages in 2 hours, 7
minutes, and 25.3 seconds, frustrating Jones' bid for a third title
in seven years.
	   ``It's a real surprise for me to become world champion,'' said
King, who only took up the sport two years ago. ``I was the last
one chosen for the Australian team and so I was the least expected
to get on the podium.
	   ``My goal was to finish ahead of Jones in the run, my dream was
to finish in the top-five.''
	   Jones, back-to-back champion in 1992-1993, nevertheless improved
on her bronze medal from last year's worlds in Perth, Australia,
claiming the silver in 2:08:03.9.
	   New Zealand's Evelyn Williamson completed a South Pacific sweep
of the podium, finishing third in 2:08:12.2.
	   Loretta Harrop, another Australian, finished fourth, 1:34.7
back, while France's Isabelle Mouthon, second in the ITU points
table, was fifth in 2:09:10.7.
	   Defending champion and ITU World Cup points leader Emma Carney,
also of Australia, had a disasterous race, her hopes for a double
dashed when her gear cable broke midway through the bike stage
	   Jackie Gallagher, a silver medallist at the last worlds, was the
fourth Australian in the top-10, finishing sixth.
	   ``If the Australians are this strong it's because of our trainer
Brett Sutton,'' said King. ``He works very hard to prepare us
psychologically and physically. He makes sure our heads and legs
are ready for h-hour.''
	   King dedicated her title to Sutton, who she says is the main
reason she can swim a respectable race, when two years ago she
``sank better than I floated.''
	   While King has made considerable progess in the water, it still
isn't her strong suit. The 22-year-old got off to slow start,
finishing 24th after the swim with a 58.2 second deficit.
	   ``The swim was a bit wild at first with so many girls fighting
to get ahead,'' explained King.
	   But a stellar performance in the bike stage brought King back to
within 3.5 seconds of Jones, leading at the start of the run.
	   Even more impressive during the final stage, King surged past
Jones in the final four kilometers, digging a massive lead and
crossing the finishline 38.6 seconds ahead of the former champion.
	   Having earned the classic distance world title, King now plans
to compete at the long-distance world triathlon championships in
Japan next weekend.
	   But King was not ready to discuss anything further than next
weekend, saying the 2000 Sydney Summer Games _ where triathlon
makes its Olympic debut _ is just too unsure.
	   ``It's too early to think about Sydney,'' said King. ``First
you've got to qualify and with the depth of field on the Australian
team, it's not a sure thing I'll be on the team.''
	   Barbara Lindquist, who led after the swim, and Susan Bartolomen
were the top Americans, finishing seventh and eighth respectively.

Kosovo Albanians disputes Serb accusations of mass murder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ultranationalist government official claiming
that Kosovo Liberation Army ``no longer exists.''
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP ) _ A pro-Albanian human rights group
disputed Sunday Serbian allegations that Kosovo Albanian guerrillas
had killed and burned 22 Serbs in the embattled southern Kosovo
province.
	   The Board for Protection of Human Rights and Freedoms, based in
Kosovo's capital Pristina, demanded an independent investigation to
determine if recently found human remains were those of Kosovo
Serbs.
	   Serbian police said Saturday they had discovered a crematory in
southern Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians allegedly had burned the
bodies of at least 22 Serb civilians.
	   They said the furnace, allegedly used to destroy the bodies of
civilians killed by the rebels, was found in the village of Klecka,
recently retaken by government forces.
	   The statement, carried by the official Tanjug news agency, was
the latest in a series of claims of brutality and atrocities by
both sides.
	   During a visit to Bosnian Serb leaders in the Bosnian town of
Bijeljina Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
renewed an old warning, said forces are being identified for use in
an attempt to halt the Serb offensive against ethnic Albanian
militants and the civilian population.
	   ``The tragedy of watching the people who have been expelled from
their homes and various killings, I think, is something that
neither the U.S. nor the European allies can tolerate much
longer,'' she said.
	   But Albright stressed that the top U.S. priority remains finding
a diplomatic solution to the conflict.
	   In Pristina, the pro-Albanian rights group said Sunday: ``The
monstrous crime was blamed on members of the Kosovo Liberation army
without first determining the truth first by unbiased, competent
experts.''
	   It hinted the remains might have been of Kosovo Albanians killed
elsewhere in the province and planted as false evidence.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have waged a months-long
offensive to crush the KLA, which is spearheading the independence
fight of Kosovo's Albanian majority. Kosovo is a province of
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides, and more than
260,000 have been rendered homeless by the fighting which erupted
in Kosovo in March this year between government forces and the KLA.
	   In Belgrade, Serbian vice premier Tomislav Nikolic of the
ultranationalist Radical Party, asserted: ``That gang (the KLA) no
longer exists, it has been broken down into small groups which
commit atrocities.
	   ``The police is resolved to finish them off by fall,'' Nikolic
was quoted by the Tanjug news agency as telling a TV station.

Subs dribble Feyenoord to second win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Goals from substitutes Igor
Korneev and Peter van Vossen eased Feyenoord Rotterdam to a 3-1
victory over MVV Maastricht Sunday.
	   Feyenoord joins Ajax Amsterdam, SC Heerenveen and FC Utrecht on
six points from two games. Utrecht leads the Dutch premiership on
goal difference after downing Cambuur Leeuwarden 3-0.
	   Henk Vos put Feyenoord ahead after just ten minutes with a
glancing header from Jean-Paul van Gastel's free kick.
	   The Rotterdammers had three strong appeals for penalties during
the first half, two of them as Ivory Coast winger Bonaventure Kalou
broke into the box.
	   The most convincing saw Kalou upended by the fierce advance of
MVV keeper Rein van Duijnhoven but referee Dick van Egmond was
unmoved.
	   Danny Landzaat equalized for MVV five minutes into the second
period but then Feyenoord's subs won the game.
	   First an individual assault on the MVV defense from Igor Korneev
made it 2-1 as the Russian struggled through challenges from three
defenders before firing home.
	   The third was Peter van Vossen's first goal back on Dutch soil
after three years at Glasgow Rangers, and it was a masterpiece.
	   Van Vossen picked up the ball in the center circle, beat five
men in his dribble and rolled the ball home from a tight angle.
	   In Sunday's other games FC Twente downed Sparta Rotterdam 1-0
and NEC Nijmegen versus NAC Breda stayed goalless.

Kabila claims South Africa sent munitions to Rwanda for Congo

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Kabila remarks in Zimbabwe; ADDS

 &UR; By MICHAEL HARTNACK &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Congo's President Laurent Kabila on
Sunday accused South Africa of supplying munitions to Rwanda that
are being used in a Congolese rebel incursion.
	   Kabila spoke to state media after landing in Zimbabwe, where he
thanked President Robert Mugabe for sending troops to help stem
rebels fighting to oust the leader.
	   ``We all know that South Africa sold more than 60 tons of guns
and ammunition to Rwanda before the aggression and we cannot see
reason in calling for a cease-fire before condemning the aggression
and calling the aggressors to retreat,'' Kabila said.
	   The insurgent coalition force of ethnic Tutsis and former
Congolese soldiers disaffected with Kabila's regime are widely
believed to be backed by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, although
both countries have denied involvement.
	   Congolese officials have hinted they believe South Africa also
is supporting the rebels, but it was the first time Kabila publicly
made the charge.
	   A South African official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press that South Africa sold munitions to
Rwanda two years ago, but no transactions had occurred this year.
	   Kabila said he would not attend the Nonaligned Movement summit
meeting that began Saturday in Durban, South Africa, because he was
``too busy organizing resistance against foreign aggression.''
	   The four-week Congo crisis was expected to dominate discussion
among global delegates who on Sunday were to consider a proposal
from Kabila to censure Rwanda and Uganda for alleged invasion of
his country.
	   Meanwhile, Rwanda's Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana repeated on
Sunday in Durban past charges that Kabila is training 10,000
insurgents to unseat the East African nation's government.
	   Gasana was in Durban for the Nonaligned Movement summit.
	   Mugabe spearheaded military intervention from Zimbabwe, Angola
and Namibia, despite warnings from other southern African countries
that the move threatened regional security. By Sunday, the alliance
had brought the rebel incursion sputtering to a halt.
	   ``The people of Congo are very happy with your soldiers. We are
now going to the eastern front and we are preparing for a counter
offensive,'' Kabila told reporters.
	   Zambia's President Frederick Chiluba met with Mugabe on Saturday
and defended military intervention to back Kabila _ even though
Zambia has not sent troops to Congo.
	   ``A rebellion is a rebellion and must be crushed,'' Chiluba
said.
	   Mugabe also met with Ethiopia's President Meles Zenawi in Harare
on Sunday. Zenawi was on his way to the summit.
	   The Zimbabwe government has not announced the number of troops
it has sent to Congo, but state controlled media Sunday trumpeted
battle successes.
	   The coalition force of ethnic Tutsi fighters and disenchanted
members of Kabila's military is trying to oust Kabila.

Indian prime minister visits Namibia, discusses precious stone

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vaypayee arrived in this southwest African nation for a two-day
visit to discuss bilateral relations and enterprises in precious
stones.
	   Vaypayee headed the 12-member delegation on a stopover en route
to the Nonaligned Movement summit in Durban, where heads of state
are to meet next week.
	   India's High Commissioner to Namibia Pripuran Singh Haer said
the two governments would discuss areas of future collaboration
that included the jewelry industry and small and medium-sized
enterprises.
	   He said India would ``certainly assist small Namibian
entrepreneurs in value-adding to precious and semiprecious
stones.''
	   In the diamond industry, value is added to a raw diamond by
cutting and setting the stone into jewelry.
	   Namibia recently opened its first diamond polishing plant, but
it still buys diamonds mined in Namibia back from the Central
Selling Organization in London that controls diamond sales
worldwide.
	   Earlier this year, Namibia signed an agreement with Russia for
their countries to cooperate in diamond mining, a deal seen as a
check on the South African cartel De Beers that controls the CSO.

Landslide jolts Himalayas again, 65 killed in Nepal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ A flash flood and a landslide triggered
by heavy monsoon rain swept away at least 65 people in a remote
mountainous region in Nepal's midwest, the state-run Radio Nepal
said Sunday.
	   Villagers have recovered 13 bodies so far in the Syangja
district from the Andhi and Bhod rivers swollen by heavy rain and
riverside villages where boulders and mud poured in Saturday.
	   The area is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of Katmandu,
the capital of the Himalayan kingdom.
	   The National News Agency reported that 16 families in the
Bahakot village were still missing. Two people have been rescued
and three bodies recovered from the village, the news agency
reported.
	   In the nearby Thulahidi village, 12 families were washed away.
The number of people in the families was not immediately known.
	   Few other details were available.
	   The Himalayas, spread across Nepal and neighboring India, have
been pulverized this year by scores of landslides caused by lashing
monsoon rains _ in some places, the most severe in nearly 60 years,
geologists amd meteorological officials say.
	   More than 350 people died this month in a string of landslides
across the lower Himalayan terrain in India's northern Uttar
Pradesh state, which borders Nepal on its east. Torrential rains
have now caused devastating floods in the state in which more than
1,000 people have died.
	   Experts have warned that worse landslides could occur on the
lower Himalayas in the coming years if villagers and greedy real
estate developers do not stop indiscriminate felling of trees on
the mountains, making the slopes vulnerable when lashed by heavy
rain.

Swiss have new ``King'' in sawdust-wrestling

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's beloved national sawdust
wrestling championship climaxed Sunday with the crowning of a
19-year-old carpenter as king.
	   Joerg Abderhalden received the coveted title _ and an
accompanying pedigree bull called Adrian _ for pinning his opponent
down after a sweaty contest combining muscles, tactics and
impeccable manners.
	   More than 70,000 fans and traditional troupes of yodelers, alp
horn blowers and folk dancers, packed into Bern's sun-drenched
soccer stadium during the two-day competition to cheer the burly
national heroes.
	   ``Schwingen,'' German for ``swing'', is more than just the
national sport. It is also a unique insight into what _ apart from
cuckoo clocks _ makes the fiercely independent Swiss tick.
	   ``Schwingen belongs to Switzerland,'' declared President Flavio
Cotti. ``We are proud of our country and our traditions. And we
will defend them.''
	   Dating back about 1,000 years, the sport was banned during the
16th and 17th century because authorities found it undignified. It
was reborn in the early 1800's as a symbol of strength and unity
against Napoleonic Europe.
	   ``Steinstossen,'' _ another integral part of the event in which
men toss a boulder weighing 83 kilograms (182 lbs) _ recalls the
era when mountain farmers used to chuck huge rocks to keep away
intruders.
	   That spirit lives on.
	   Even today, followers of ``Schwingen'' _ overwhelmingly male and
from the country's conservative rural heartland _ mistrust outside
interference.
	   The national pride on display at the festival _ held every three
years _ also illustrates why Switzerland is still outside the
United Nations and European Union.
	   Cotti, a pro-European, said he had been warned not to raise the
subject of closer European integration in his speech.
	   ``I was told I should rather read from the telephone directory
or television schedules than deal with the theme of Europe,'' he
said.
	   His advisers warned him he would otherwise risk seeing stars in
front of his eyes _ and not those of the European Union's flags,
Cotti added. He was only half joking.
	   The rules of Schwingen are simple and strict. Competitors have
to wear khaki shorts over their long trousers. Each wrestler has to
keep one hand on the shorts of the opponent while trying to pin all
or part of his back to the sawdust.
	   Correct manners are a must. The winner helps the loser up and
brushes the sawdust off his back. All recipients of awards _
ranging from the winner's pedigree bull to color televisions and
vacuum cleaners _ must send written thanks within one week.
	   Marketing deals are frowned upon and prize winners are not meant
to sell off their trophies.
	   Abderhalden, 1.90 meters (6.3 feet) tall and weighing 120
kilograms (264 pounds), was regarded as the season's rising star
but was not the top favorite among the 300 competitors.
	   He defeated 31-year-old veteran Werner Vitali in the final for
the title as Schwinger King.

Thousands flock to see basketball superstar Jordan in charity golf

<TEXT>
	   CARY, North Carolina (AP) _ The masses chased after him,
basketballs, posters, cards and ink pens in hand, their little feet
unable to keep up with his long strides or golf cart.
	   Whether they saw him in the movie ``Space Jam'' or simply
overheard their dads call him the greatest basketball player ever,
thousands of children wanted a glimpse of Michael Jordan on Sunday
at the Jimmy V Celebrity Golf Classic.
	   ``Mighty Mouse and Superman and all those people, they are not
as promoted anymore,'' Duke University coach Mike Krzyzewski said
when asked to analyze Jordan's appeal to children. ``They are all
alive and well in one person _ Michael Jordan.''
	   Thousands of spectators lined Jordan's first hole an hour before
his scheduled 9:30 a.m. tee time, jockeying for position to see his
first shot of the day and first-ever in the 5-year-old event. The
rest of Prestonwood Country Club's 53 holes were virtually empty.
	   Every other person seemed to have a camera or camcorder, and
many held their children high on their shoulders to see Jordan
approach the first tee. Kids, some dressed in Chicago Bulls or
North Carolina Tar Heels uniforms, poked their parents saying,
``There he is, there he is.''
	   ``Michael said to me, `This is awesome,''' said Pam Valvano, Jim
Valvano's widow. ``He never expected it to be this big.''
	   ``It's an Arnie and a Jack gallery,'' said Prestonwood director
of golf and former PGA Tour pro Vance Heafner, referring to the
throngs of fans those famous golfers drew in their prime.
	   Jordan avoided talking about his basketball future on the No. 1
tee.
	   ``I am not even thinking about that,'' he said. ``My golf day is
just starting so I'm trying to keep it straight and not hit
anybody.''
	   Steve Stefano, who knew a month ago he would be one of four
other players paired with Jordan, was still a bit nervous on the
first tee.
	   ``How could you not be?'' he asked. ``I've played in these
before, so you get a little used to (the crowds) but never like
this, never like this.''
	   For the most part, Jordan stayed clear of the ropes, either
walking down the middle of the fairway or riding a golf cart. He
drew a huge roar from the crowd when he sank a 10-foot birdie putt
on the first hole, then got a few chuckles when he had an exchange
with a woman in the crowd around the second tee.
	   The woman held up a sign that read, ``Show me your Hanes,''
referring to the company whose T-shirts and other underwear he
promotes.
	   Jordan turned, pointed to the woman, laughed and said, ``That's
a good one.''
	   She responded: ``I'll show you mine.''
	   Jordan teed off, then posed for a picture with the woman.
	   The 6-foot-6 (198-centimeter) Jordan, a 3-handicap, has
reportedly been playing 36 holes a day. His game showed it. He
blasted a 300-yard (meter) drive down the middle of the fairway on
the fourth hole.
	   ``His swing is good and it's under control,'' said Heafner, who
helped Jordan with the layout of the course. ``People that say his
handicap is not as low as it is are wrong. The guy can play.''
	   Heafner stopped short of saying Jordan could make it on the PGA
Tour.
	   ``I think Michael Jordan can do whatever he puts his mind to,''
Heafner said. ``He sure is enjoying himself and he's got a good
attitude. I haven't seen his short game. He may just need a little
bit of fine-tuning, but I bet he's got some nerves, don't you?''

Jewish militants reportedly threaten Netanyahu, Islamic sites
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members
of his Cabinet have been threatened by Jewish militants who aim to
derail peace talks with the Palestinians, Netanyahu's aide said
Sunday.
	   And Israel radio reported that the Shin Bet internal security
agency believes that the same militants have hatched plans to
strike at the Temple Mount, home to Islam's third holiest shrine.
	   Netanyahu has met intensively over the past week with members of
the Shin Bet in charge of protecting VIPs after receiving the
warnings.
	   ``There are reports of plans by extremists, specifically Jewish
extremists to hurt the prime minister, the defense minister, and
other officials as long as the peace process continues and through
its completion,'' Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky told Channel
Two.
	   The threats are especially chilling in a country which was
traumatized by the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in
November 1995 by an ultra-nationalist Jew who aimed to end the
land-for-peace process with the Palestinians.
	   Last week, a member of the outlawed anti-Arab Kach party, from
the Jewish settlement in Hebron, West Bank, was charged with
incitement for calling Israel's moderate president a traitor who
should be removed from power.
	   Also, Israel radio and Channel 2 TV reported that Netanyahu and
other ministers were briefed in a special session with security
chiefs Sunday on plans by Jewish militant groups to carry out an
attack on the Temple Mount.
	   Israel radio said police were beefing-up security at the site,
which has been the target of such groups in the past. The Temple
Mount, home to the al-Aqsa mosque and above Judaism's Western wall,
is at the center of the Mideast conflict, and such an assault on
the site is likely to trigger violence and upset chances for a
continuation of the peace process.
	   According to Zeev Schiff, an Israeli intelligence expert who
writes for the daily Haaretz newspaper, recent Shin Bet security
assessments point to a civil war in Israel's future.
	   ``They (Shin Bet officials) said extreme right-wing groups could
fight one another or the Israeli army, in other words, a civil
war,'' Schiff told Israel Television, ``In the past year, there are
groups that are more extreme right, their ideology is more extreme
and they simply want to end the peace process,'' Schiff said.
	   Police arrested three residents of the militant Jewish community
of Hebron Sunday for assaulting and throwing stones at Palestinians
in the city. Several others have been taken in for questioning and
charges are pending against at least 20 settlers for violent
attacks against Arabs and Israeli authorities. Sunday, the Israeli
police announced it was formign a special task force to deal solely
with charges against Hebron settlers.
	   Television footage caught settler children for a seventh day in
a row taunting and hitting Palestinian passersby. One young Israeli
boy wearing a skullcap smiled at his parents while he kicked a
Palestinian adult. Other settlers have been filmed throwing stones
and yelling ``murderer'' and ``dogs,'' at Palestinian men and women
in the city streets.
	   Anger has been mounting inside the tiny Jewish community of 500
settlers who live with 30,000 Palestinians in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron, since a rabbi was stabbed to
death 10 days ago.
	   Two Hebron settlers were also arrested Sunday on suspicion of
inciting violence against Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, whom many settlers have said is not doing enough to
protect them.
	   Mordechai has recently become a target of increasing anger from
extreme right-wing groups. Eerily similar of the anti-Rabin
demonstrations held in the weeks before the assassination,
right-wing activists have staged daily protests outside Mordechai's
home and a report last week said militants had plotted to kill him.
	   As a moderate in a hardline government and a supporter of a
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians, Mordechai has never been
a favorite of Israel's right-wing, including Jewish settler groups.

Albright sets meeting with NATO commander

<TEXT>
	   BIJELJINA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Western contingency plans
for an attack on Serb forces in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo are
accelerating, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Sunday.
	   On a stopover en route to the presidential summit in Moscow,
Albright said she would meet Monday with NATO's top military
officer, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark.
	   Renewing an old warning, Albright said forces are being
identified for use in an attempt to halt the Serb offensive that
has claimed a high civilian toll and left tens of thousands of
people homeless.
	   Albright stressed that the top U.S. priority remains finding a
diplomatic solution to the struggle between the Serbs and
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.
	   ``Neither the United States nor the European allies can tolerate
this much longer,'' she said on a busy day in the Balkans that was
marked also by positive signs.
	   In Bijeljina, the Bosnian Serb half of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Albright met with leaders credited with trying to implement the
1995 Dayton peace accord that ended 3 1/2 years of warfare.
	   They have been rewarded with U.S. assistance, which Albright
said would be increased by dlrs 20 million to dlrs 30 million this
year.
	   ``We are using this money to fix bridges and roads, schools and
clinics and to provide loans for businesses,'' she said. ``We have
been able to do this because the government the people of Republika
Srpska elected have made a real commitment to implement Dayton.
They know that Dayton means jobs, reconstruction and a normal life.
In other words, Dayton pays.''
	   She visited a rebuilt feeder station that supplies electricity
to 110,000 people and three industrial zones. The project was
finished three days ago. And dlrs 1.6 million in U.S. contributions
will also be used to bring clean water to the area.
	   ``You should be very proud. It's a great message to run on,''
she told Biljana Plavsic, the president of the Serb republic, who
broke from war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic and will seek
another term in nationwide elections in two weeks.
	   By the end of the year, Albright said, the United States will
have provided dlrs 100 million in aid to Bosnia. ``The election
will be a chance to tell us what kind of country Bosnia will be,''
she said.
	   She pressed the same point in the Sarajevo suburb of Stup.
There, in a speech to hundreds of returned refugees, she made clear
that the United States would offer assistance only to areas that
promote tolerance.
	   ``Whatever the outcome of the vote, we will provide support only
to those communities that meet their responsibility to implement
Dayton by welcoming refugees, making joint institutions work, by
upholding justice and the law,'' she said.
	   Albright also took an indirect slap at Germany and Austria,
which are eager to have Bosnian refugees depart. ``I hope our
European allies will recognize,'' she said, ``that it is also
irresponsible to force them to return where there is no security,
no housing and no jobs.''
	   Earlier, in Croatia, she lectured President Franjo Tudjman on
the pace of return of ethnic Serb refugees, a press that is still
partly under government control and Croatia's close ties to ethnic
Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   ``Bosnian Croats have to be able to act independently,''
Albright said, referring to the Western effort to establish a
diversified, peaceful state in a region populated with often
clashing communities.
	   Tudjman resisted. At a joint news conference, he said Croats in
Bosnia should not be denied their ``mark of identity,'' conjuring
up the notion of creating a ``greater Croatia'' at Bosnia's
expense.
	   A senior U.S. official, briefing reporters later in Sarajevo,
said Albright had called for an overhaul of election laws in
Croatia and for an easing of restrictions on the news media.
	   Specifically, the official said, the state-approved television
network was seriously distorting the positions of Kresimir Zubak,
the moderate Bosnian Croat who serves on Bosnia's tripartite
presidency, with voicer-overs and other unfair tactics.

Subs dribble Feyenoord to second win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Goals from substitutes Igor
Korneev and Peter van Vossen eased Feyenoord Rotterdam to a 3-1
victory over MVV Maastricht Sunday.
	   Feyenoord joins Ajax Amsterdam, SC Heerenveen and FC Utrecht on
six points from two games. Utrecht leads the Dutch premiership on
goal difference after downing Cambuur Leeuwarden 3-0.
	   Henk Vos put Feyenoord ahead after just ten minutes with a
glancing header from Jean-Paul van Gastel's free kick.
	   The Rotterdammers had three strong appeals for penalties during
the first half, two of them as Ivory Coast winger Bonaventure Kalou
broke into the box.
	   The most convincing saw Kalou upended by the fierce advance of
MVV keeper Rein van Duijnhoven but referee Dick van Egmond was
unmoved.
	   Danny Landzaat equalized for MVV five minutes into the second
period, but then Feyenoord's subs won the game.
	   An individual assault on the MVV defense from Igor Korneev made
it 2-1 as the Russian struggled through challenges from three
defenders before firing home.
	   Peter van Vossen scored his first goal back on Dutch soil after
three years at Glasgow Rangers, and it was a masterpiece.
	   Van Vossen picked up the ball in the center circle, beat five
men in his dribble and rolled the ball home from a tight angle.
	   In Sunday's other games, FC Twente downed Sparta Rotterdam 1-0
and NEC Nijmegen versus NAC Breda stayed goalless.

Cuban president named winner of Gadhafi human rights award
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with award ceremony televised on Libyan
TV. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya awarded Cuban President Fidel Castro
its 1998 human rights award, which is named in honor of Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, Libyan television reported.
	   Castro, who was not present at the televised ceremony in the
Libyan capital, Tripoli, won the award for the ``defense of his
people and his steadfast stand against the imperialism that
surrounds him,'' said a statement read out by a representative of
the General People's Committee for the Gadhafi Award for Human
Rights.
	   It was not clear if the award will be presented to Castro
himself at some later date.
	   The award statement was read during the ceremony which was aired
live on Libyan television and monitored in Cairo.
	   The speakers included Libyan officials, former Zambian President
Kenneth Kaunda and the Cuban Ambassador to Libya.
	   The speakers praised Gadhafi and Castro for their ``valor, ''
and said the two leaders were ``visionaries who stood firm in the
face of imperialism.''
	   Previous winners of the dlrs 250,000 award include South African
President Nelson Mandela, Louis Farrakhan, the controversial leader
of the Nation of Islam, and the children of Palestine.
	   The prize has been given annually since 1989 and is generally
awarded during celebrations marking the anniversary of the coup
that brought Gadhafi to power in September 1969.
	   Other contenders for this year's prize were Pope Shenouda III,
who is head of the Coptic Christian church in Egypt, and former
U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
said earlier Sunday. It did not say why they were nominated.

United Nations team to assess flood damage in Bangladesh

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A United Nations disaster assessment
team will travel to Bangladesh Monday to study the damage caused by
devastating floods that have killed 627 people and marooned
millions, a domestic news agency reported Sunday.
	   The official BSS news agency reported that the two-week U.N.
mission would assess the flood situation in 44 of the country's 64
districts submerged by raging rivers as part of efforts to muster
international aid for the flood victims.
	   Nearly 30 million people across the country have been either
marooned, taken to relief centers or displaced from their homes,
The New Nation newspaper quoted officials as saying.
	   The government has sought foreign aid of dlrs 680 million for
emergency relief and an extensive rehabilitation program.
	   ``The immediate response to our appeal is positive and
encouraging,'' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Sunday in an
address to the nation telecast on state-owned television and radio.
``Friendly nations and agencies have already committed 665,000
metric tons of food grain in aid of the flood affected people.''
	   Hasina said the United States had made a commitment of 200,000
tons (181,437 metric tons) of wheat. The European Union and
Australia are rushing 81,000 tons and 86,000 tons of wheat
respectively, she said.
	   The flood situation deteriorated further Sunday in six districts
of the country including the capital, Dhaka, where more than 5
million of the 9 million residents have been hit by the flood.
	   The health ministry reported 12 fresh deaths late on Saturday.
	   A doctor at Dhaka's largest diarrhea hospital in Dhaka said an
average of 1,000 patients were being brought for treatment each
day. Nearly 150,000 cases of diarrheal diseases have been brought
to government health centers for treatment since July 15 when the
flooding started, officials said.
	   The Flood Forecasting and Warning Center said the flooding may
continue for another two weeks and end in mid-September.

Lebed: It's in Chechnya's best interests to remain within Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two years after he signed an agreement ending the
war in Chechnya, retired Gen. Alexander Lebed warned Chechens on
Sunday that their economic prosperity still depends on Russia.
	   Lebed, attending a conference in Grozny, the Chechen capital,
argued that the breakaway province should remain part of the
Russian federation.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent following its war of
secession with Russia, but Russia maintains that the southern
republic is still within its territory.
	   ``It is essential that Russian-Chechen relations be solved
before 2001, as well as war wounds healed and both Chechen and
Russian mothers' tears dried,'' Lebed said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   He said he was ``not sure that the world community will accept a
state that created a precedent by seceding from the Russian
Federation.'' No country recognizes Chechnya's independence.
	   Lebed said sovereignty should not be an end in itself, but a
means to achieve prosperity. ``Chechnya's economic tearing-off from
Russia would be painful,'' he added.
	   Lebed negotiated the end of the Chechen hostilities and is now
governor of the Siberian territory of Krasnoyarsk. He is frequently
named as a potential presidential candidate.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A chronology of events in Russia during the past
eight days:
	   Sunday, Aug. 23 _ President Boris Yeltsin fires Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko and reinstates Viktor Chernomyrdin as acting prime
minister.
	   Monday, Aug. 24 _ Yeltsin says he brought Chernomyrdin back
because he needed a ``heavyweight'' to tackle the burgeoning
economic crisis. Reformer Boris Nemtsov quits as first deputy prime
minister. Value of the ruble falls to 7.14 to the dollar (14 cents)
from 6.29 (16 cents) a week earlier.
	   Tuesday, Aug. 25 _ Ruble falls 9.2 percent to close at 7.86
(12.7 cents), biggest one-day plunge in nearly four years. Currency
trading suspended twice when banks overwhelmed by demand for
dollars.
	   Wednesday, Aug. 26 _ Central bank cancels already-agreed dollar
sales for first time. Government fails to make payments on
longer-term debt previously unaffected by the crisis. Ruble falls 5
percent to 8.26 to dollar (12.1 cents).
	   Thursday, Aug. 27 _ Opposition demands that Yeltsin resign,
drafts power-sharing agreement and package of Soviet-style economic
measures to reverse reforms.
	   Friday, Aug. 28 _ Yeltsin goes on national television to declare
he won't resign. Currency trades suspended for third straight day,
but stocks rise slightly in light trading. Ruble's street hovers
below 10 to the dollar (10 cents).
	   Saturday, Aug. 29 _ Chernomyrdin begins negotiating
power-sharing agreement with parliament, declares that Russia will
not return to a Soviet-style economy. Ruble's street value rises
slightly, is mostly above 10 to the dollar (10 cents).
	   Sunday, Aug. 30 _ The interim government and parliamentary
leaders tentatively agree to an 18-month truce that would leave
Yeltsin in control and give the administration time to try to end
the crisis. But Communists say they won't support the deal,
throwing it into doubt.

Turmoil in Asia and Russia increases need for banking reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 2200 GMT Sunday, Aug. 30. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Financial turmoil in Asia and Russia
underlines the need to reform the world's banking structure, a
central bankers' report released Sunday said.
	   The global system is ``increasingly beyond the reach'' of
national regulators, said the 78-page study by the Bank for
International Settlements, known as the central bankers' central
bank.
	   ``Questions have been raised concerning the international
response to recent events,'' said the report, entitled
International Banking and Financial Market Developments.
	   Better international cooperation is needed to cope with global
financial markets' increasing interdependence, it added.
	   Although market tensions in Asia eased somewhat earlier this
year, a new round of turbulence rocked the region in the second
quarter of 1998, according to the study.
	   That upheaval's repercussions on the rest of the world were
deeper than before because of concerns about the situation in
Russia and other countries suffering economic imbalances.
	   BIS statistics show international banks reduced substantially
their exposure to Asia during the first quarter of 1998, and
support earlier anecdotal evidence of contagion elsewhere, the
report said. It did not specify where that contagion was.
	   In the second quarter, nervousness about Japanese economic and
financial conditions increased investors' coolness towards
yen-denominated assets. Policy credibility problems in several
Asian countries pressured currencies in the region downward.
	   ``These events, together with the weakness of commodity prices
and, in some countries, political uncertainty, initiated a new wave
of contagion to other emerging market economies,'' triggering a
flight towards the perceived safe-haven markets of the United
States and Europe, according to the study.
	   Renewed financial turbulence in the second quarter of 1998 has
lent a ``new sense of urgency'' to the need for crisis prevention
and resolution.
	   A consensus seems to be developing on the need for improved
information, reduced reliance on short-term capital and other
measures in Asia, said the report. But these may not be enough to
prevent crises and will take time to establish, it added.
	   A commitment by Asian governments to rapidly adopt necessary
adjustment measures is needed but ``doesn't yet appear to be
forthcoming in some countries,'' the study said, without giving
names. The region's governments should also decide how to share the
financial costs of crises.
	   ``Asian countries as a group are faced with a less favorable
external environment requiring strong policy commitment,'' it said.

Sosa hits 54th homer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Sammy Sosa hit his 54th home run on Sunday, a
towering two-run blast in the first inning off Colorado's Darryl
Kile.
	   The Chicago Cubs slugger tied St. Louis' Mark McGwire for the
major league lead. They are both two homers shy of tying Hack
Wilson's NL home run record, set in 1930.
	   Sosa's shot, which struck the Coca-Cola sign just left of the
scoreboard in left field, was estimated at 482 feet (147 meters),
making it the longest at Coors Field this season and the
fifth-longest in the stadium's history.
	   Sosa, chasing Roger Maris' major league record of 61 homers, hit
a 1-2 pitch for his first career homer against Kile. Previously,
Sosa had gone 4-for-31 against Kile with 13 strikeouts.
	   The crowd cheered Sosa when he came to the plate, as it had done
throughout this four-game series, and gave him a rousing ovation
after the homer.
	   Sosa's blast was his 25th this season on the road, extending his
club record.
	   Sosa, who hit a solo homer here Friday night, now has 10 career
homers at Coors Field, which ranks him third among Colorado
opponents. Los Angeles' Eric Karros has 13 homers at Coors and New
York's Mike Piazza 12.

<TEXT>
	   YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - In the tumult before the downfall
of President Suharto, the sultan of this history-steeped city
emerged a hero, at one point climbing on a car roof to cool the
zeal of a throng of unruly protesters.
	   Like a beloved king and his minions, Sri Sultan Hamengku Buwono
X and many local people share a rapport that eclipses the
limitations of his largely ceremonial post and the erosion of royal
power centuries ago.
	   Trappings of pedigree abound in his white-walled palace, a maze
of courtyards and pavilions where aging retainers in sarongs,
daggers tucked in cummerbunds, squat and smoke clove-scented
cigarettes.
	   In the Javanese dialect, the Sultan's name means ``World in his
Lap.'' Guests can call him ``Your Highness.''
	   But with reform sweeping Indonesia, the heir to a long line of
Javanese kings is molding himself as a voice for democracy and
sharp critic of the new government.
	   ``I'm the godfather of feudalism,'' or an heir to the feudal
past, said the Sultan, a 52-year-old ex-legislator, in an interview
in his quarters. ``But I don't exercise feudalism in my daily life.
I was born after Indonesia became independent. I'm living in the
new era.''
	   Tall and trim, the Sultan tapped cigarettes out of a pack in a
chamber crammed with Chinese porcelain and portraits of royal
luminaries. Well-coiffed, he wore a batik shirt.
	   A stuffed tiger, fangs bared, lurked in one corner as servants
shuffled on their knees, crab-like, in a traditional show of

Eyewitness recalls horror of attack, militants threaten revenge
</HEADLINE>
against U.S. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Islamic militants had offered their
last prayer of the day and were preparing to go to bed when the
U.S. Tomahawk missiles screamed overhead and slammed into nearby
buildings.
	   That from an eyewitness, a member of the radical Harakat
ul-Ansar group, which was declared a terrorist organization more
than one year ago by the U.S.
	   The eyewitness report was published in this week's edition of
Harakat ul-Ansar's weekly Urdu-language newspaper Al-Hilal.
	   The article rails against the United States, threatens revenge
for the Aug. 20 missile strike on suspected terrorist training
camps in eastern Afghanistan and mourns the death of its militants.
	   According to Washington, the missiles targeted camps run by
Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, the man the U.S. believes financed
the bombings of two U.S. embassies in east Africa earlier this
month.
	   In the Afghanistan attack, 13 missiles hit an called Markaz
Khalid bin Waheed, 10 missiles slammed into an area called Markaz
Amir Muavia and five blasted a base belonging to Jalaluddin
Haqqani, the Taliban religious army's minister of border affairs,
according to the newspaper's eyewitness report.
	   There were 1,200 members of Harakat ul-Ansar training in the
area at the time of the attack, said the newspaper. Nine were
killed, it said.
	   Four mosques in nearby villages were destroyed and ``the burned
pages of 200 Korans'' were strewn over the area.
	   ``Three of our friends who were killed, their limbs were
scattered and we buried them there in Afghanistan,'' said one
eyewitness, who was not identified.
	   According to the report ``a large number of villagers'' were
killed, many of them victims of collapsed homes and shattered
windows.
	   ``When the missiles hit we thought that the Russians had
attacked once again,'' said another eyewitness who was not
identified. He was referring to the 1980s war against invading
Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan.
	   It was then that Islamic militants from dozens of countries,
many of them nearby Arab nations, converged on Afghanistan to fight
against the communist army that had marched into the Central Asian
state on Dec. 27, 1979.
	   Training camps were set up and weapons poured into the country,
supplied by the United States and other sympathetic western
countries who were supporting the Islamic rebels jehad or holy war
against the former Red Army.
	   When the former Soviet Union pulled its soldiers out of
Afghanistan in 1989 and the pro-communist government in Kabul fell
in 1992 many of these militants returned to their home countries to
lead insurgencies against their own governments they perceived as
being pro-West and not sufficiently Islamic.
	   ``They were in search of other enemies,'' said Pakistan's
information Minister Mujahid Hussein.
	   The U.S. missile attack on Afghanistan and Sudan has inflamed
militant Muslim sentiments.
	   ``America has invited it's own death upon itself,'' said Maulvi
Fazl-ur-Rehman Khalil, head of Harakat ul-Ansar in a statement
carried in the Al-Hilal newspaper. ``If we don't get any justice
from the world court we know how to get our own justice.''

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Eastern and Western Christians and
other religious leaders from some 50 countries gathered Sunday in
this former Communist capital, attempting to cast aside discord and
fight for peace and tolerance.
	   But the three-day meeting was overshadowed by divisions within
the World Council of Churches, the Orthodox Churches and a church
dispute in Romania.
	   The head of Orthodoxy, Bartholomew I, and the Russian Patriarch
Alexei II were conspicuously absent from the conference. Before it
started, questions were raised about its timing.
	   Last fall, the Bulgarian, Georgian and Serbian Orthodox Churches
left the World Council of Churches, protesting against Protestants
groups, who they claim have compromised Christianity by showing too
much tolerance towards homosexuals.
	   The Romanian Orthodox Church's relations with its Russian
counterpart are strained over the Moldovan Church, which was part
of the Romanian church before World War II when Moldova and Romania
were united. But after 1991, when Moldova declared independence,
its Orthodox believers stayed under Moscow's tutelage.
	   In addition, relations between the Orthodox centers in Istanbul
and Moscow turned sour in 1996 when the small Estonian Orthodox
Church asked to go under Istanbul's protection. This reportedly
angered Russian Patriarch Alexei II, who is an ethnic Estonian.
	   In Romania itself, the disagreement is over church property
Eastern Rite Catholics request to be returned from the Orthodox
Church.
	   However, Romania's President Emil Constantinescu, who is seen as
wanting to promote Romania as a regional power by hosting the
meeting, appealed Sunday to church and other leaders to avoid
imposing their own political, cultural and religious values.
	   ``It is more reasonable to identify the evil we all fight
against,'' he said, citing terrorism, war, famine, racism and
discrimination as the ills of the contemporary world.
	   The interdenominational gathering, comprising Christians,
Muslims, Buddhists and Jews, was preceded earlier in the day by an
open-air Orthodox church service.
	   Israel's Chief Rabbi Meir Lau, eight Catholic cardinals and
Islamic leaders are among those in attendance.
	   American Sister Helen Prejean, whose opposition to the death
penalty was portrayed by Susan Sarandon in the film ``Dead Man
Walking,'' will give a talk. Sarandon won an Oscar for her role.
	   Critics noted several other Orthodox Church leaders stayed away,
and Protestants were thin on the ground. In addition to Peter VII,
the only other heads of national Orthodox Churches were Romanian
Patriarch Teoctist and Patriarch Chrysostomos of Cyprus.
	   One of the aims of the conference is to set the stage for a
visit by Pope John Paul II, who was invited by Constantinescu to
come to Romania in May 1999.
	   However, the papal visit requires the blessing of the Romanian
Orthodox Church, who has set certain conditions. Almost 90 percent
of Romanians adhere to the Orthodox creed.
	   The Orthodox want Romania's 300,000-strong Eastern Rite
Catholics, the country's second largest church, to drop demands for
the return of hundreds of churches seized by the Communists and
given to the Orthodox in 1948.
	   There are about 300 million Orthodox believers worldwide.

Libyan plane evacuates stranded Arabs from Congo, violating air
</HEADLINE>
ban &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In violation of a U.N. air embargo, a Libyan
aircraft on Sunday evacuated Arab families stranded in Congo, the
Libyan news agency JANA reported.
	   It said the plane, carrying ``a number of Arab families,''
returned to the Libyan capital, Tripoli, Sunday night.
	   The mission had been launched ``within the framework of the
humanitarian efforts by the Libyan people,'' said the agency, which
was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   It gave no details and it did not specify the nationalities of
the evacuees fleeing the violence in Congo.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila _ backed by troops from Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia _ is locked in a war against rebels allegedly
backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Libya is under an air ban imposed six years ago after it refused
to turn over two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet
over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   The U.N. Security Council voted Thursday to suspend the
sanctions once Libya hands over the suspects for a trial in the
Netherlands by a panel of three Scottish judges.
	   The resolution was passed after Libya agreed to the trial.

Jackson beats Johnson; Brits, Americans split sprint contest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ World record holder Colin Jackson edged
world and Olympic champion Allen Johnson in yet another showdown
between the two 110 meter hurdlers Sunday while Britain and the
United States had scored it even in their own head-to-head rivalry
in the sprints.
	   Running into a headwind, Jackson pulled away from Johnson off
the last hurdle at the Scotstoun Stadium to cross the line in 13.40
seconds. Johnson, who has beaten Jackson in the major championships
over the past four years, placed second in 13.42.
	   ``I'm on top of my game and I'm very pleased with that result,''
the Welshman said. ``There are plenty of competitions still left,
the World Cup, the Commonwealth Games and four of five Grand Prix
meetings so there is a lot of battling to do.''
	   American 100 meter stars Tim Harden and Vince Henderson finished
1-2, both clocking 10.32 into the strong headwind and beating
newly-crowned European Champion Darren Campbell, the sprinter who
is being dubbed the ``new Linford Christie.''
	   ``We had to run into a headwind but it was a good competitive
race with my fellow countrymen,'' said Harden, who is due to
compete for the United States at the Grand Prix final in Moscow and
the World Cup in South Africa.
	   ``I felt good. I just got over here (to Europe) so I'm probably
a little bit fresher than the other guys.''
	   Coached by former Olympic titlist Christie, Campbell came home
third in 10.37.
	   While the Americans dominated the short sprint in the Britain
vs. United States challenge international match, British runners
scored notable victories over their rivals in the 200 and 400 meter
races.
	   Doug Turner charged clear of World Indoor 200-meter titlist
Kevin Little to win the 200 in 20.63 seconds. The American placed
second in 21.17. Britain's leading 200-meter star, Doug Walker, was
absent after surgery Friday to remove broken knee cartilage.
	   Iwan Thomas charged past early leader Harry ``Butch'' Reynolds,
the world record holder, coming off the final bend of the 400
meters and then held off a late charge by Milton Campbell to win in
45.13.
	   Campbell took second in 45.16 and Reynolds, who says he aims get
back to his competitive best next season after a spell of low-key
performances, clocked 45.54.
	   An American quartet of Kareem Streete-Thompson, Tony McCall,
Allen Johnson and Harden clocked a fast 38.47 to win the 400-meter
relay and the U.S. also took the 1,600 relay.
	   A blunder by Britain's Jamie Baulch, who slowed and repeatedly
looked over his shoulder while leading near the end of the third
led, lost the lead and then game Thomas too much to do against
Campbell.
	   The Americans, hurdling star Kevin Young, Woody, Tony Wheeler
and Campbell, won in 3:04.96. Despite the two relay triumphs, a
comparatively weak U.S. team lost the match 141 points to 132
against a British lineup close to full strength.
	   Eric Thomas edged world record holder Young for a U.S. 1-2 in
the 400 meters hurdles to clock 48.84 seconds. Young, whose world
mark is 46.78, had 49.59.
	   John Godina won the shot put with a heave of 21.13 meters but
placed third in the discus behind fellow American Adam Setliff and
Britain's Robert Weir.
	   Godina, former world champion at both events, is setting himself
up for bigger performances in next week's Grand Prix final in
Moscow and the World Cup in South Africa a week later.
	   ``I really don't think I or anybody else will be putting at this
level come the Grand Prix final and the World Cup,'' he said.
	   ``Everybody is going to step up their act for those two meets.
I'm sure the Europeans will not let me have my own way but I'm more
than positive about both competitions and the discus.''
	   With world record holder Jonathan Edwards watching from the
stands because of an ankle injury which has ruled him out of the
Commonwealth Games and the rest of the season, Julian Golley leaped
16.63 meters to win the triple jump ahead of American jumper La
Mark Carter, who had 16.40.

Taliban leader says Clinton should be stoned to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The reclusive leader of Afghanistan's
Taliban army Mullah Mohammed Omar was quoted as saying U.S.
President Bill Clinton should be stoned to death for becoming
involved with a woman who is not his wife.
	   This according to a weekly newspaper published by the militant
Islamic group, Harakat ul-Ansar. Washington last year declared this
group a terrorist organization.
	   The newspaper, quoting Omar, said ``Clinton is a confessed
sinner and a bad person.''
	   Ruling out the possibility of holding negotiations with Clinton,
Omar was quoted as saying ``It is absolutely not possible to
negotiate with such a person and he should be removed (from power)
and stoned to death. He is of bad character.''
	   In strict Islam it is a capital offense to have sex outside of
marriage and it is punishable by stoning. Clinton has confessed to
an inappropriate relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban army has imposed a harsh brand of
Islamic law on its country since taking over the capital of Kabul
in 1996.
	   It has imposed Islamic punishments that include the death
penalty, the amputation of limbs for theft and public beatings for
minor offenses.
	   Referring to the Aug. 20 missile attack on eastern Afghanistan
by the United States, the newspaper quoted Omar as demanding an
apology from the U.S. administration.
	   ``America should apologize to the world of Islam and should
remove its forces from Muslim countries,'' the newspaper quoted
Omar as saying.

Iranian parliament member says Taliban has killed missing Iranian
</HEADLINE>
diplomats &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A member of the Iranian parliament was
quoted Sunday as saying he believed that the Taliban movement in
Afghanistan killed 11 Iranian diplomats after the storming of
Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Mortaza Nabavi, a prominent deputy in Iran's Majlis, or
parliament, was quoted by the Farsi-language daily Rouznameh Zan.
It was the first time an Iranian official has said the diplomats
might be dead.
	   Nabavi said that reliable Shiite Muslim sources, whom he did not
name, reported that the diplomats were killed by the Taliban. He
gave no further details.
	   Iran claims that the 11 diplomats, along with 35 truck drivers
and a journalist for the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency,
were captured by the Taliban when the fundamentalist group overran
the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban has said it knows nothing about the Iranian
diplomats, but it admits to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of
arming its opponents.
	   Iran is believed to have backed the northern-based opposition to
the Taliban, while Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and
other support to the Taliban.
	   Iran has said it holds Pakistan responsible for the detainees'
safety.
	   Earlier this month, an Iranian official was allowed to meet with
the detained Iranian truck drivers in the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar.
	   Iran's deputy foreign minister, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, said the
official found the drivers to be in good health but that the
Taliban did not allow him to meet the missing diplomats or the IRNA
correspondent.

Pakistan accuses India of ''unwarranted interference''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan on Sunday accused India of
``unwarranted interference'' in its internal affairs after India's
prime minister criticized Islamabad's plans to introduce a new
legal system based on the Muslim holy book, the Koran.
	   ``It is unacceptable and unwarranted interference in the
internal affairs of Pakistan,'' said Information Minister Mushahid
Hussein.
	   Hussein was referring to statements by Indian Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee that a proposed constitutional amendment to
create a new Islamic order in Pakistan was a step backward.
	   The Press Trust of India quoted Vajpayee as saying that ``when
we are preparing to enter the 21st century such a step in Pakistan
takes us backward. This cannot be welcome.''
	   On Friday Pakistan introduced a constitutional amendment that
would scrap the old British common laws and replace them with
Islamic laws based on the Koran and the Sunnat, which are the
writings of Islam's prophet, Mohammed.
	   According to the Press Trust of India, Vajpayee said that a new
Islamic order in Pakistan ``will have a definite impact on
Afghanistan and in the Central Asian republics.''
	   After last May's tit-for-tat nuclear explosions, Hussein said it
was incumbent on both India and Pakistan to choose their words
carefully when criticizing each other.
	   ``We need to act in a mature and responsible manner . . . more
so in light of the momentous (events) in the month of May,'' said
Hussein referring to the underground nuclear explosions carried out
by both India and Pakistan. ``We should be very careful about what
we say about each other.''
	   The two unfriendly neighbors have fought three wars since the
Asian subcontinent gained its independence from Britain. Two wars
have been fought over the disputed state of Kashmir and a third
conflagration over Bangladesh or what was then East Pakistan.
	   Hussein dismissed fears that the proposed amendment would create
a fundamentalist state in Pakistan similar to its neighbor
Afghanistan, where the Taliban religious army has imposed a harsh
form of Islamic rule.
	   In Afghanistan women have been banished from the work force,
forced to wear the all enveloping burqua, and schools for girls
have been closed. Men have been ordered to pray in the mosque and
grow their beards.
	   But Hussein said rigid fundamentalist parties have been soundly
defeated at the polls in Pakistan mustering barely three percent of
the vote in successive elections.
	   Rather he said India, with the election of a Hindu nationalist
party, is dealing with Hindu fundamentalism, which has been bad
news for minority Muslims in that country.

Blair discusses Russian crisis with leaders of major powers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second Blair-Clinton call, comment from
spokesman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair is calling leaders of
the major industrialized powers to share assessments of Russia's
economic crisis and political changes.
	   Blair, who holds the rotating chairmanship of the Group of Eight
major industrialized nations, spoke to U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday night and again Sunday night.
	   On Saturday, he spoke to French President Jacques Chirac and
Italy's Prime Minister Romano Prodi, and on Sunday, he conferred
with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Japanese premier Keizo
Obuchi.
	   ``There is a clear feeling ... that it is in all our interests
to make sure Russia gets through this crisis and that it will best
do so by sticking to the reform path,'' said a spokesman for Blair,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Following Blair's second conversation with Clinton, the
spokesman said the major industrial powers were waiting to see
Viktor Chernomyrdin, confirmed as the new prime minister.
	   ``Clearly, we need to wait to see Chernomyrdin confirmed and a
new government formed and a program mapped out,'' the spokesman
said.
	   The spokesman said there are no plans for an emergency summit of
the group.
	   Russia, whose economic crisis has been building all summer, is
the newest member of the Group of Eight. The growing global turmoil
in developing markets hit Russia, leading to the collapse of its
financial markets and forcing the government to devalue the ruble
two weeks ago. This triggered a larger crisis of confidence in
President Boris Yeltsin's government.
	   Blair has been making the calls from Balmoral Castle in Scotland
where he and his wife, Cherie, are guests of Queen Elizabeth II.
The prime minister traditionally spends a weekend at Balmoral when
the queen is vacationing with her family.

Jewish militants reportedly threaten Netanyahu, Islamic sites
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members
of his Cabinet have been threatened by Jewish militants who aim to
derail peace talks with the Palestinians, Netanyahu's aide said
Sunday.
	   And Israel radio reported that the Shin Bet internal security
agency believes that the same militants have hatched plans to
strike at the Temple Mount, home to Islam's third holiest shrine.
	   Netanyahu has met intensively over the past week with members of
the Shin Bet security service, which is in charge of protecting
VIPs after receiving the warnings.
	   ``There are reports of plans by extremists, specifically Jewish
extremists, to hurt the prime minister, the defense minister, and
other officials as long as the peace process continues and through
its completion,'' Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky told Channel
Two.
	   The threats are especially chilling in a country which was
traumatized by the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in
November 1995 by an ultra-nationalist Jew opposed to handing over
land in exchange for peace with the Palestinians.
	   Last week, a member of the outlawed anti-Arab Kach party, from
the Jewish settlement in Hebron, West Bank, was charged with
incitement for calling Israel's moderate president a traitor who
should be removed from power.
	   Also, Israel radio and Channel 2 TV reported that Netanyahu and
other ministers were briefed in a special session with security
chiefs Sunday on plans by Jewish militant groups to carry out an
attack on the Temple Mount.
	   Israel radio said police were beefing-up security at the site,
which has been the target of such groups in the past. The Temple
Mount _ home to the al-Aqsa mosque and above Judaism's holiest
site, the Western Wall _ is at the center of the Mideast conflict.
An assault on the site would likely trigger violence and upset
chances for continuing peace talks.
	   According to Zeev Schiff, an Israeli intelligence expert who
writes for the daily Haaretz newspaper, recent Shin Bet security
assessments point to a civil war in Israel's future.
	   ``They (Shin Bet officials) said extreme right-wing groups could
fight one another or the Israeli army, in other words, a civil
war,'' Schiff told Israel Television, ``In the past year, there are
groups that are more extreme right, their ideology is more extreme
and they simply want to end the peace process,'' Schiff said.
	   Police arrested three residents of the militant Jewish community
of Hebron Sunday for assaulting and throwing stones at
Palestinians. Several others have been taken in for questioning and
charges are pending against at least 20 settlers for violent
attacks against Arabs and Israeli authorities. Israeli police
announced Sunday the formation of a special task force to deal
solely with charges against Hebron settlers.
	   Television footage caught settler children for a seventh day in
a row taunting and hitting Palestinian passersby. One young Israeli
boy wearing a skullcap smiled at his parents while he kicked a
Palestinian adult. Other settlers have been filmed throwing stones
and yelling ``murderer'' and ``dogs,'' at Palestinian men and women
in the city streets.
	   Anger has been mounting inside the tiny Jewish community of 500
settlers, who live with 30,000 Palestinians in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron, since a rabbi was stabbed to
death 10 days ago.
	   Two Hebron settlers were also arrested Sunday on suspicion of
inciting violence against Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, whom many settlers have said is not doing enough to
protect them.
	   Mordechai has recently become a target of increasing anger from
extreme right-wing groups. Right-wing activists have staged daily
protests outside Mordechai's home and a report last week said
militants had plotted to kill him.
	   As a political moderate who supports a land-for-peace deal with
the Palestinians, Mordechai has never been a favorite of Israel's
right wing.

	   CRATHIE, Scotland (AP) _ Princess Diana's sons, in Scotland on
the eve of the anniversary of her death, spent Sunday in private
with their father, far from the strangers who brought bouquets by
the hundreds to the gates of her London palace.
	   ``Hear our prayers for those grieving the loss of a loved one in
circumstances known to the world but only experienced by a few,''
said the Rev. Robert Sloan, presiding at the morning service at
Crathie church, near Balmoral Castle.
	   Diana's sons, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13, sat in
the front pew on either side of their father, Prince Charles.
	   The boys were at Balmoral last year when they learned that Diana
had been killed in a car crash in Paris. The royal family
traditionally spends August in the Scottish Highlands.
	   In London, admirers of the princess again brought flowers to her
old home of Kensington Palace, a fragrant echo of the mourning and
the weeklong vigil that followed the princess's death on Aug. 31,
1997.
	   ``I thought there would be more flowers and more people here,''
said Liegh O'Malley, 50, who came from suburban Essex county. ``But
it is wonderful to see everyone coming from all over the world to
remember.''
	   Scores of well-wishers, strung along the tree-shaded approach to
the Crathie church, waited quietly for the limousines to move
slowly past, waving at Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, the Queen
Mother Elizabeth and two younger generations, who smiled and waved
back.

Airport officials investigate cause of a crash that killed 79

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Investigators picked through the charred
remains of a Cuban airliner that plowed into a soccer field,
searching on Sunday for clues to the disaster that killed 79
people, including five children playing on the ground.
	   The Tupolev 154 aircraft owned by Cubana de Aviacion burst into
flames Saturday during takeoff, clipping through two homes and an
auto mechanic's shop before slamming into the field 200 yards (182
meters) from a runway at Quito's Mariscal Sucre International
Airport.
	   The plane was headed to the coastal city of Guayaquil and then
on to Havana. It was carrying 76 passengers and a 14-member crew,
said Gen. Osvaldo Dominguez, director of the Civil Aviation Office.
At least 21 passengers reportedly survived the crash.
	   Rescue workers found another charred body Sunday, bringing the
death toll to 79. At least 10 people on the ground were killed.
	   Survivors said they heard loud noises before the crash, and
Dominguez said that it appeared one of the engines stalled before
the crash.
	   Police cordoned off the site while investigators searched for
the plane's black box and a local resident missing since the crash.
It was not immediately clear if the body found Sunday was that of
the missing neighbor.
	   Firefighters sprayed jets of water on to the smoldering ruins,
hoping to prevent further explosions. Though part of the fuselage
remained intact, the plane's nose and front section disintegrated.
	   The jet barely missed a busy street at the end of the airport
runway in a middle-income residential neighborhood 9,300 feet
(2,834 meters) above sea level in the Andes mountiains.
	   ``There was a great deal of noise, the plane started to shake,
we all went forward and the plane split in half,'' said Eduardo
Rivadeneira, 21, one of the crash survivors who was traveling with
his aunt. ``I then saw ... people on fire and shouting madly. I
managed to get out of the plane before it burst into fire.
	   ``My aunt did not make it.''
	   None of the crew members survived the crash high in the Andes.
Two stewardesses helped passengers escape from the burning plane,
only to be consumed by the fire, survivors told local newspapers.
	   Relatives of the Ecuadoreans who died in the crash began
identifying remains. Among them, Elvira San Martin, mother of three
of the dead children, who came to the city morgue supported by
other family members. She wept as she saw their charred corpses.
	   San Martin said her children were outside their tin-roof shack,
just before the plane ripped through the one-room dwelling. She had
not been home at the time.
	   ``My kids were playing,'' she said, ``and then I never saw them
again.''
	   President Jamil Mahuad visited the crash site and said he would
insist on a study to move the airport.
	   ``I deeply lament the tragedy,'' Mahuad said. ``This is one more
reason to relocate the airport as soon as possible.''
	   The neighborhood of carpentry and mechanics shops has long been
plagued by noise and the risk of accidents.
	   In 1984, an Ecuadorean cargo plane slammed into the neighborhood
beyond the end of the runway after failing to gain altitude,
killing 65 people.
	   And in 1996, a Brazilian FLY airlines plane carrying a Brazilian
soccer team, crashed into airport walls after one of the jet
turbines flamed out and the crew aborted the takeoff. One player
was slightly injured.
	   The Cubana plane used the same takeoff route as the two planes,
which both fell in roughly the same spot as the Cubana plane.

FC Barcelona starts title defense with a goal-less draw against
</HEADLINE>
Racing &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Defending champion FC Barcelona drew with
modest Racing de Santander while Zaragoza trashed Athletic de
Bilbao 2-0 to take the lead Sunday in the Spanish first division's
opening round.
	   The Catalan team coached by Dutchman Louis Van Gaal looked set
to start with a win until Racing's Russian striker Vladimir
Bestchastnyck threatened Barcelona with three dangerous shots and
restored the team's confidence against the powerhouse.
	   Van Gaal's team gave a poor show despite the array of foreign
talent at its disposal, including Brazilians Rivaldo and Giovanni
and new Dutch international signings Phillip Cocu and Boudewijn
Zenden.
	   Predictions that new foreign stars brought to Spain this summer,
costing millions of dollars, would dominate play failed to pan out.
	   Ruud hesp, Barcelona's Dutch goalkeeper and a 1-year Sapnish
league veteran, became the man to beat with several spectacular
dives throughout the match, leaving Racing unable to get a goal
past him.
	   Perennial title contender and the League's runner-up, Athletic
de Bilbao did not look as powerful as last season in its 2-0 loss
against Zaragoza.
	   Marcos Vales scored in the 66th minute using a deflection from a
corner to catch the goalkeeper unaware. Argentine Gustavo Lopez
added a goal to secure victory eight minutes later to give Zaragoza
the lead in the Spanish premier League.
	   In other games Sunday, it was: Espanyol 2, Tenerife 1; Real
Sociedad 3 Oviedo 3; Salamanca 0, Mallorca 0; Celta 0, Deportivo de
La Coruna 0, Extremadura 0, Valladolid 0; Zaragoza 2, Athletic de
Bilbao 0.
	   On Saturday, Valencia beat Atletico de Madrid 1-0 and Alaves
drew 0-0 against Betis. Real Madrid will host newly promoted
Villareal, a side playing its first game ever in the premier
division, on Monday.
 &UR; Real Sociedad 3, Oviedo 3 &QC; 
	   In San Sebastian, Juan Menendez 'Manel' powered a last-minute
equalizer as Oviedo hit back to tie 3-3 with Real Sociedad.
	   Peter Duvosky of Slovakia gave Oviedo the first lead in the 14th
minute thanks to a pass by Panamanian Dely Valdes.
	   Real responded with an equalizer in the 23rd minute by
Portuguese Ricardo Da Silva Sa Pinto, but three minutes later
Valdes placed Oviedo ahead 2-1. Real's second goal by Picabea in
the 48th minute placed the two teams on an equal footing again,.
	   Aitor Aldeando placed the third goal for Real in the 80th minute
of the second half.
 &UR; Espanyol 2, Tenerife 1 &QC; 
	   The two second-ranking teams fought fiercely, but it was a 2-1
victory for Espanyol _ despite playing one man down during most of
the match.
	   Argentine striker Juan Eduardo Esnaider scored in the 43rd
minute and Miguel Angel Benitez of Paraguay scored in the 48th to
reassure the local team's victory before Slavisa Jokanovic scored
for Tenerife on a 54th minute penalty.
	   In Vigo, Celta and Deportivo fought out a 0-0 draw, while first
division newcomer Extremadura managed a 0-0 draw against veteran
Valladolid. Newly promoted Salamanca and Mallorca also finished
with a goal-less draw in the opening round.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Investigators picked through the charred
remains of a Cuban airliner that plowed into a soccer field,
searching on Sunday for clues to the disaster that killed 79
people, including five children playing on the ground.
	   The Tupolev 154 aircraft owned by Cubana de Aviacion burst into
flames Saturday during takeoff, clipping through two homes and an
auto mechanic's shop before slamming into the field 200 yards (182
meters) from a runway at Quito's Mariscal Sucre International
Airport.
	   The plane was headed to the coastal city of Guayaquil and then
on to Havana. It was carrying 76 passengers and a 14-member crew,
said Gen. Osvaldo Dominguez, director of the Civil Aviation Office.
At least 21 passengers reportedly survived the crash.
	   Rescue workers found another charred body Sunday, bringing the
death toll to 79. At least 10 people on the ground were killed.
	   Survivors said they heard loud noises before the crash, and
Dominguez said that it appeared one of the engines stalled before
the crash.
	   Police cordoned off the site while investigators searched for
the plane's black box and a local resident missing since the crash.
It was not immediately clear if the body found Sunday was that of
the missing neighbor.
	   Firefighters sprayed jets of water on to the smoldering ruins,
hoping to prevent further explosions. Though part of the fuselage
remained intact, the plane's nose and front section disintegrated.
	   The jet barely missed a busy street at the end of the airport
runway in a middle-income residential neighborhood 9,300 feet
(2,834 meters) above sea level in the Andes mountiains.
	   ``There was a great deal of noise, the plane started to shake,
we all went forward and the plane split in half,'' said Eduardo
Rivadeneira, 21, one of the crash survivors who was traveling with
his aunt. ``I then saw ... people on fire and shouting madly. I
managed to get out of the plane before it burst into fire.
	   ``My aunt did not make it.''
	   None of the crew members survived the crash. Two stewardesses
helped passengers escape from the burning plane, only to be
consumed by the fire, survivors told local newspapers.
	   Relatives of the Ecuadoreans who died in the crash began
identifying remains. Among them, Elvira San Martin, mother of three
of the dead children, who came to the city morgue supported by
other family members. She wept as she saw their charred corpses.
	   San Martin said her children were outside their tin-roof shack,
just before the plane ripped through the one-room dwelling. She had
not been home at the time.
	   ``My kids were playing,'' she said, ``and then I never saw them
again.''
	   President Jamil Mahuad visited the crash site and said he would
insist on a study to move the airport.
	   ``I deeply lament the tragedy,'' Mahuad said. ``This is one more
reason to relocate the airport as soon as possible.''
	   The neighborhood of carpentry and mechanics shops has long been
plagued by noise and the risk of accidents.
	   In 1984, an Ecuadorean cargo plane slammed into the neighborhood
beyond the end of the runway after failing to gain altitude,
killing 65 people.
	   And in 1996, a Brazilian FLY airlines plane carrying a Brazilian
soccer team, crashed into airport walls after one of the jet
turbines flamed out and the crew aborted the takeoff. One player
was slightly injured.

Venus Williams seeks giant step to U.S. Open title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVE WILSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Tennis Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Venus Williams made more than a little noise
with her beads, brashness and bump with Irina Spirlea at the U.S.
Open a year ago.
	   Now she's back hoping to raise the level a notch by capturing
her first Grand Slam title.
	   As the U.S. Open begins Monday, Williams returns more polished
in every way, and has the confidence of several tournament titles
behind her. Last year, she seemed to be learning on the run at the
Open, assessing how to play big points in big matches, gauging when
to rally, when to come in, when to go for hard shots, when to just
keep the ball in play.
	   This time around, she's got most of that figured out.
	   ``I think my serve is much better,'' Williams said. ``I would
say I'm much smarter. I think I play better shots. I make better
selections. I know I win matches from my playing well or if I'm not
supposed to win.''
	   Williams has been bothered much of the summer by a strained
knee, but says it is in pretty good shape right now with the help
of rest and regular stretching.
	   At the start of the year, Williams boasted that she would be No.
1 by year's end. That's unlikely now, though her No. 5 seeding is
not too shabby for someone playing less than two full years on the
tour.
	   ``I thought maybe I'd be higher up,'' she said. ``But it's
difficult when you're an athlete because you always want to be
better. Sometimes you have to be happy where you're at.''
	   The women's draw at the Open is perhaps stronger than ever.
Steffi Graf showed in Saturday's final victory over Jana Novotna in
New Haven that she's ready to challenge for a major title again
after a year away from the game. Novotna, though, should not be
discounted with her confidence still high after winning Wimbledon.
	   Defending champion Martina Hingis has been in a slump since
winning the Australian Open to start the year, but doesn't seem too
worried. She tuned up by playing three tournaments and taking a
week off.
	   ``It seems like I always get to the semis and finals and can't
win the tournament,'' she said. ``But this is a different one, the
last Grand Slam of the year. I'll save my energy and go round by
round.
	   ``This year the players became much stronger. You have the
younger players, who are more experienced. And the older ones, they
started practicing again and they want it back. They won the last
two Grand Slams. Right now it's a very big competition.''
	   With Graf on the rise, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario still high from
her French Open title, Novotna strong and Monica Seles reasserting
herself, the ``older ones'' certainly are looking eager to take the
game back from the teens like Hingis, Anna Kournikova, and the
Williams sisters.
	   Then, too, there's the player in the middle who never has won a
major, Lindsay Davenport. The 1996 Olympic champion is slimmer and
quicker than ever, and the hard courts at the National Tennis
Center suit her game perfectly.
	   In the men's draw, defending champion Patrick Rafter is perhaps
the hottest player of the summer, followed closely by Andre Agassi.
There are dangerous players scattered throughout the seeds, but the
one who's No. 1, Pete Sampras, is still the man everyone fears the
most.
	   ``There's Pete, and then there's the rest of us,'' Rafter said.
``I played well last year, and hopefully I can come in here and do
it again if the draw opens up for me. There are a lot of good
players who could win it. But all of us know that the player to
beat is Pete.''

More Internet use is more depressing, study says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLAUDIA COATES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ The more hours people spend on the Internet,
the more depressed, stressed and lonely they feel, according to a
groundbreaking study that surprised its authors.
	   Internet use had the same effect even for people who spent most
of their time in such social activities as chat rooms or exchanging
e-mail, said the study headed by Robert Kraut, a social psychology
professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
	   Sociable users ended up feeling just as isolated as users who
spent more time crawling the Web for information, Kraut said
Sunday.
	   One reason for the negative effect may have been that using the
Internet left less time for the deeper relationships of friends and
family, Kraut suggested.
	   ``People are substituting weaker social ties for stronger
ones,'' he said. ``They're substituting conversations on narrower
topics with strangers for conversations with people who are
connected to their life.''
	   It was the first study to examine the emotional impact of
people's Internet use over time, Kraut said.
	   The findings contradicted the researchers' expectation that
Internet use would foster social contact, especially through e-mail
and chat rooms.
	   Kraut and his colleagues followed 93 Pittsburgh-area families
for two years. The families were given computer, phone lines and
use of the Internet for free, in return for agreeing to fill out
occasional questionnaires.
	   The true-false questionnaires included such statements as ``I
can't find companionship when I want it,'' ``I felt that everything
I did was an effort,'' and ``I felt I could not shake off the
blues, even with help from my family and friends.''
	   The number of hours they spent on line were recorded
electronically.
	   Participants' levels of depression and loneliness were measured
at the start of the study. At the end of the two years, researchers
found they could predict changes in an individual's emotional state
according to the number of hours spent on the Internet.
	   The reverse was not true. ``Depression and loneliness doesn't
predict subsequent use of the Internet,'' Kraut said.
	   The dlrs 1.5 million study was funded by the National Science
Foundation, the Markle Foundation and 13 computer, software or
communications companies, including AT-and-T Research, Bell
Atlantic, the U.S. Postal Service, Apple Computer, Hewlett Packard
and Intel. It is to be published this week in The American
Psychologist, the monthly journal of the American Psychological
Association.
	   One study participant, 17-year-old Andrea Rubinsky of
Pittsburgh, said she didn't feel any worse for her Internet use,
although her Internet use has dropped since the study began. She
started out using it 10 hours to 15 hours per week but now averages
about three hours, she estimated.
	   ``It just also might be I have more things to do now,'' Andrea
said.
	   She made no lasting friends through the chat rooms, she said,
but does use e-mail to keep up with friends she has met in person.
	   Her father, Peter, also didn't feel he ever neglected personal
relationships to spend time on-line.
	   ``I would say there's a conflict with other things that needed
to get done. The grass didn't get mowed sometimes and the car
didn't get washed,'' Rubinsky said.
	   The study will continue in order to examine the mechanisms that
seem to produce the emotional effects and how computer use compares
with television use.
	   Other scientists told The New York Times that the research may
start a debate over how the Internet should be shaped.
	   Christine Riley, a psychologist at Oregon-based Intel, told the
Times the research results surprised her but that more study was
needed.
	   Tora Bikson, a senior scientist at the Rand Corp., a the
research institution, said the study was carefully done and not
easily ignored.

	   CRATHIE, Scotland (AP) _ Princess Diana's sons, in Scotland on
the eve of the anniversary of her death, spent Sunday in private
with their father, far from the strangers who brought bouquets by
the hundreds to the gates of her London palace.
	   ``Hear our prayers for those grieving the loss of a loved one in
circumstances known to the world but only experienced by a few,''
said the Rev. Robert Sloan, presiding at the morning service at
Crathie church, near Balmoral Castle.
	   Diana's sons, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13, sat in
the front pew on either side of their father, Prince Charles.
	   The boys were at Balmoral last year when they learned that Diana
had been killed in a car crash in Paris. The royal family
traditionally spends August in the Scottish Highlands.
	   In London, admirers of the princess again brought flowers to her
old home of Kensington Palace, a fragrant echo of the mourning and
the weeklong vigil that followed the princess's death on Aug. 31,
1997.
	   ``I thought there would be more flowers and more people here,''
said Liegh O'Malley, 50, who came from suburban Essex county. ``But
it is wonderful to see everyone coming from all over the world to
remember.''
	   Scores of well-wishers, strung along the tree-shaded approach to
the Crathie church, waited quietly for the limousines to move
slowly past, waving at Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, the Queen
Mother Elizabeth and two younger generations, who smiled and waved
back.
	   Queen Elizabeth II thanked people who have sent many messages of
sympathy, though the royal website as well as in the mail.
	   ``The queen and the royal family, particularly the Prince of
Wales, Prince William and Prince Harry, would like to thank people
for their messages and kind gestures of sympathy at this sad time
and for sharing their remembrance of the Princess of Wales,'' said
the royal statement.

Rafter wins Hamlet Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COMMACK, New York (AP) _ Patrick Rafter defeated Felix Mantilla
of Spain, 7-5 (7-3), 6-2 to win the Hamlet Cup on Sunday, and
declared he is ready to defend his U.S. Open title.
	   The 25-year-old Australian, ranked No. 3 on the ATP Tour and the
second seed at the tournament, defeated Mantilla, the eighth seed,
for the third time in as many matches to earn dlrs 45,000 and 150
ATP points.
	   ``Physically, I'm more refreshed and a lot more relaxed for the
U.S. Open than I was last year,'' Rafter said.
	   ``I don't have to prove anything. My record this summer speaks
for itself. I'm going into the tournament with a lot more
confidence and a stronger mental attitude.''
	   Rafter broke the 23-year-old Mantilla twice, bolting to a 4-0
lead in the second set. He had 11 aces for the match, compared to
Mantilla's four.
	   ``Today I didn't want to lose and have that hanging over me,''
Rafter said. ``I served well and it was just a matter of time
before I got Mantilla. I definitely put him under a lot of
pressure.''
	   Rafter, only broken once in 54 service games in his five
matches, won 37 of 41 first-serve points to Mantilla's 23-of-30.
	   ``I tried everything against him,'' Mantilla said. ``His serve
just got better and better. I think I'm going to go and practice
with him and find out how he does it.''
	   Rafter, in becoming the first Australian to win the Hamlet Cup _
he was runnerup to Carlos Moya last year _ is 26-3 with four titles
since mid-June. Rafter is 45-16 and has won five titles this year.
	   The last Australian to win at least five championships in a
season was John Newcombe, who won nine, and Rod Laver, five, both
in 1974.

Mother allegedly drowned four sons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Police detained a 33-year-old woman Sunday
on suspicion that she drowned her four sons while her husband was
attending Mass.
	   The father came home to find the bodies of the boys in barrels
of water outside his house in Mlynne, a village 350 kilometers (220
miles) south of Warsaw, according to police spokesman Zbigniew
Ladka.
	   Ladka said the father pulled out the bodies of the boys, aged 8,
7, 5 and 1, and called for a doctor, who pronounced them dead.
	   Police found the mother hiding in the attic. They had to prevent
the father from attacking her, Ladka said.
	   Under Polish law, the names of crime suspects cannot be released
until formal charges have been filed. The mother, who police
suspect is mentally ill, was in custody, Ladka said.

...'
 &UR; Toronto Blue Jays 6, Minnesota Twins 0.

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Roger Clemens pitched a two-hitter for his third
straight shutout and extended his scoreless innings streak to 29
Sunday, leading the Toronto Blue Jays to a 6-0 win over the
Minnesota Twins.
	   Clemens (17-6), who hasn't lost since May 29, pitched three-hit
shutouts over Seattle and Kansas City in his previous two starts.
The 36-year-old right-hander walked three and struck out seven in
his fifth complete game this season.
	   Clemens, who reeled off 11 straight wins last season en route to
winning his fourth Cy Young Award, is unbeaten in his last 17
starts. He was coming off an 18-strikeout performance against the
Royals.
	   After allowing Alex Ochoa's one-out single in the first, Clemens
didn't give up another hit until Todd Walker singled with two outs
in the seventh.
 &UR; Seattle Mariners 13, New York Yankees 3
	   At New York, Ken Griffey Jr. hit his American League-leading
46th and 47th homers, giving him five in eight games, as the
Seattle Mariners routed the New York Yankees.
	   Griffey drove in five runs with his 34th career multihomer game
and a sacrifice fly to the warning track. Silent for the first half
of August, he may be making a late bid to rejoin the home run race
led by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa with 54 each.
	   A day after the Yankees became the first team in major league
history to clinch a postseason spot in August, they looked nothing
like a playoff club. A crowd of 55,341 watched New York fall behind
10-0 in the fifth inning and saw its four-game winning streak
stopped.
	   Griffey hit a three-run homer in the second and lined a leadoff
shot in the eighth.
 &UR; Kansas City Royals 3, Baltimore Orioles 2
	   At Baltimore, The Kansas City Royals completed their first sweep
of Baltimore since 1991 and stretched the Orioles' losing streak to
seven games.
	   Mendy Lopez had two RBIs in a three-run fifth inning that lifted
the Royals to their ninth win in 11 games. Kansas City turned three
double plays and had eight in the three-game series.
	   The Royals third straight one-run victory gave them their first
three-game sweep of Baltimore since June 1991, the year before the
Orioles moved to Camden Yards.
	   Mike Bordick homered for Baltimore, which has endured three
losing streaks of at least seven games this season.
 &UR; Anaheim Angels 8, Boston Red Sox 6
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Garret Anderson homered and drove in three runs as
Anaheim won its second straight series against a possible playoff
opponent.
	   The Angels, who took two of three games from the Red Sox after
winning three of five in New York earlier in the week, built a 7-2
lead with two runs in the second, four in the third and one in the
fourth.
	   Mo Vaughn hit a three-run homer, John Valentin had a two-run
homer and Nomar Garciaparra added a solo shot for Boston.
	   Red Sox starter Tim Wakefield (15-6) had his worst start of the
season, giving up seven runs and six hits in 3 2-3 innings.
	   Shigetoshi Hasegawa (7-3) pitched 3 1-3 innings of scoreless
relief for the win, and Troy Percival pitched the ninth for his
38th save.
 &UR; Tampa Bay Devil Rays 10, Detroit Tigers 5
	   At Detroit, Rolando Arrojo pitched seven shutout innings for his
first win since July 16 and Bobby Smith homered as Tampa Bay beat
Detroit.
	   Aaron Ledesma had four RBIs for the Devil Rays, who won three of
four from Detroit to move 1 1/2 games ahead of the Tigers in a race
to avoid the AL's worst record.

<TEXT>
	   FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) _ Diego Serna scored three goals
on assists from Carlos Valderrama as the Miami Fusion solidified
its hold on a playoff spot with a 3-2 win Sunday over the New
England Revolution.
	   Serna's game-winning goal came on a give-and-go with Valderrama
in the 80th minute, after the Revolution had rallied from a
two-goal second-half deficit.
	   The goal was Serna's seventh this season, and the fifth in his
last four games.
	   Miami evened its record at 13-13 and now has 29 points, nine
ahead of the Revolution and eight more than Tampa Bay in the race
for the fourth and final playoff spot in Major League Soccer's
Eastern Division .
	   The win was Miami's sixth straight at home.
	   New England, which was playing its first game under new coach
Walter Zenga, dropped to 8-19 with 20 points. Zenga replaced Thomas
Rongen, who resigned under pressure last Monday.
	   Serna first scored in the 17th minute, then again at 28 minutes
to give the Fusion what appeared to be an insurmountable edge. The
Colombian forward nearly made 3-0 in the 50th minute, but was
thwarted by New England goalkeeper Ian Feuer.
	   In the second half, the Revolution struck back, making it 2-1 in
the 56th minute when midfielder Edwin Gorter scored on a shot from
28 yards. Gorter's shot deflected off Miami defender Kris
Kelderman, right past rookie goalkeeper Matt Napoleon.
	   Revolution forward Raul Diaz Arce stunned the Lockhart Stadium
crowd of 6,127 in the 74th minute when he first-timed a left-footed
volley just inside Napoleon's post to tie it at 2-2. The goal was
Diaz Arce's 18th this season.

Patience pays: Duval holds off challengers to win World Series
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AKRON, Ohio (AP) _ With no one making a serious charge at him,
David Duval maintained his lead and his composure and then nailed
back-to-back birdies coming down the stretch to win the NEC World
Series of Golf on Sunday.
	   Duval's final-round 2-under-par 68 left him at 11-under 269 and
two shots ahead of 1996 World Series winner Phil Mickelson.
	   The victory was Duval's sixth in a remarkable 11-month span in
which he has pocketed more than dlrs 3.3 million. It was his third
win this year _ more than anyone else on tour.
	   The dlrs 405,000 first-place check also put him atop the money
list with more than dlrs 2 million this year.
	   Duval, who started the day with a one-shot lead over local
favorite John Cook, eagled the second hole and bogeyed the next but
still retained a two-shot lead on Mickelson.
	   Duval parred the next seven holes _ while holding on to the same
two-shot edge _ but bogeyed the par-4 11th when his chip from just
off the back of the green rolled 25 feet (7.6 meters) past the
hole.
	   Mickelson was within a shot but was in the midst of a string of
14 straight pars.
	   Duval then put it out of reach by rolling in a 12-foot
(3.6-meter) birdie putt at the 13th hole and following that with a
15-footer (4.6-meter putt) for birdie at No. 14 to expand his lead
to three shots.
	   After birdies on the 17th and 18th holes in the third round gave
him the one-shot lead, Duval said he expected to occasionally make
mistakes in the final round and was hoping to remain patient until
he was faced with birdie opportunities.
	   That was precisely what happened as he saved par three times
with pinpoint bunker shots and kept the challengers at bay with his
two birdies and an eagle.
	   Meanwhile, everyone else within reach was just muddling through.
	   Tiger Woods began the day four shots back but never seriously
threatened, falling by the wayside with back-to-back bogeys at Nos.
14 and 15 on the way to an even-par 70 and 5-under 275.
	   Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara drew as close as
two shots after a birdie at the 13th, but followed that up with a
bogey at 14 and a double-bogey at the 16th when he hit his sand
wedge approach into the pond in front of the green. His 72 left him
at 4-under 276.
	   It was another major disappointment for Cook, who grew up in
Akron and learned to play on the Firestone Country Club course. He
had led the tournament _ which is managed by his father, Jim _ a
year ago through three rounds only to shoot a closing 74 that
dropped him into a tie for third, five shots back of winner Greg
Norman.
	   Cook said he was depressed for weeks after that loss.
	   This time he birdied the second hole to crawl within a shot but
never made a run. He ended up with a 71 and was four shots back at
273 after parring the last 12 holes.
	   Mickelson was the only player to keep Duval in his sights. While
shooting a 68 that left him alone in second at 271, he almost cut
the gap to a shot on the final hole when his bladed sand wedge from
the fringe stopped on the lip and he had to settle for par.
	   Davis Love III had the lowest round of the day, a 65, to get to
272 for sole possession of third place.
	   Duval joined a select fraternity with the win. Since 1960, only
nine players have won at least three titles in back-to-back seasons
on the PGA Tour: Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Billy Casper, Ray
Floyd, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Johnny Miller, Nick Price and now
Duval.
	   This was the final year for the World Series name and the
current format, which has remained relatively unchanged since 1976.
Next year, the tournament will be known as the NEC Invitational,
part of the four-event World Golf Championship. The field will be
composed primarily of players from the sport's all-star teams _ the
Ryder and Presidents Cup squads _ along with additional qualifiers.

Chang defeats Haarhuis to win MFS Pro tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLINE, Massachusetts (AP) _ Michael Chang won his first
title of the year Sunday with a straight-sets victory over Paul
Haarhuis of the Netherlands at the MFS Pro Championships at the
Longwood Cricket Club.
	   Displaying the crisp style and endless hustle that has always
made him a crowd favorite, Chang, the fourth seed, won the final
match 6-3, 6-4.
	   It was a sweet victory in a tough year for Chang, one in which
his once-high ranking dropped to 22 and he suffered a number of
injuries.
	   ``I've tried to keep a positive attitude and keep battling,'' he
said.
	   Chang broke serve in the sixth game to take a 4-2 lead in the
first set. Haarhuis had a chance to break back, but failed to
convert. The Dutchman held his serve to bring the score to 5-3, but
Chang then served out to take the opening set.
	   ``That was the turning point,'' Haarhuis said. ``I tried to
attack his backhand, and I felt I played as well as he did. The
difference was, I couldn't take advantage of my chances.''
	   In the second set, both players stayed on serve until the ninth
game. Then Chang again delivered a service break, and went on to
take the opening point on a serve and volley. Haarhuis appeared to
tire and lost the critical game on a pair of double-faults.
	   Chang then closed the match out with a pair of sizzling
forehands in the final game.
	   ``I tried to be patient out there today and wait for my
opportunities,'' Chang said.
	   It was the first singles final of the year for Haarhuis, one of
the world's top doubles players.

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Sammy Sosa hit his 54th homer to tie Mark McGwire
for the major league lead and Kevin Tapani pitched seven strong
innings as the Chicago Cubs beat the Colorado Rockies 4-3 Sunday.
	   Sosa remained ahead of Roger Maris' record 61-homer pace,
putting the Cubs ahead 2-0 in the first with a towering, 482-foot
(147-meter) homer off the Coca-Cola sign next to the scoreboard in
left field.
	   The two-run shot off Darryl Kile (10-15) was the longest homer
at Coors Field this season and the fifth-longest in ballpark
history.
	   Jose Hernandez and Gary Gaetti also homered for the Cubs, who
won three out of four in the series.
	   Tapani (16-7) equaled his career high for wins in a season,
holding the Rockies to six hits and one run in seven innings. Rod
Beck put the tying run on second in the ninth before getting two
outs for his 39th save.
 &UR; Houston Astros 11, Pittsburgh Pirates 4
	   At Houston, Rookie Richard Hidalgo homered twice and the Houston
Astros got their 40th come-from-behind victory this season.
	   Houston, which trailed 3-0 in the first inning, has won three
straight games and 18 of 23.
	   Shane Reynolds (17-8) struck out a season-high 11 in seven
innings. He allowed four runs and six hits in winning for the fifth
time in his last six starts.
	   Jeff Bagwell hit two doubles and his 28th homer, a two-run shot
in the eighth for Houston. Houston had six doubles and three home
runs among its 14 hits. Turner Ward hit a three-run homer in the
first for the Pirates.
 &UR; Cincinnati Reds 14, Florida Marlins 7
	   At Cincinnati, the Cincinnati Reds finished a perfect season
against the Florida Marlins _ winning all nine games _ by coming
from behind three times.
	   Bret Boone hit his fourth homer in four games, drove in four
runs and extended his hitting streak to a career-high 13 games as
the Reds completed a four-game sweep of the defending World Series
champions.
	   It's the first time this century that the Reds have gone
undefeated against another National League team in a season series.
It's nothing new for the Marlins, who have been swept by three
National League teams this year alone.

Irwin wins another senior tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CONCORD, Massachusetts (AP) _ Hale Irwin didn't let a strong
challenge from Jay Sigel keep him from winning the BankBoston
Classic for the second straight year.
	   Irwin shot a 4-under-par 68 Sunday for a 15-under 201 total and
a two-stroke victory over Sigel, who had a 6-under 30 on the front
nine only to fade to a 66 with bogeys on two of the last three
holes.
	   The victory at Nashawtuc Country Club was Irwin's sixth in his
last 13 starts, the most on the Senior PGA Tour this season, and
the 19th since he turned 50 in 1995.
	   Irwin has finished in the top five in each of the 16 tournaments
he has played this season and in the top three in 42 of the 74
senior tour events he has played.
	   The dlrs 150,000 first-place check put his 1998 earnings at dlrs
2,251,750 and brought his total senior tour earnings to dlrs
7,110,058. He's the fifth senior tour player to top the dlrs 7
million mark.
	   At 204 were Joe Inman, who started the day tied with Irwin at 11
under but had a closing 71, and David Graham, who had a 68. Another
shot back were Allen Doyle, who had a 69, and Al Geiberger, who had
a 71.
	   On Sunday, Irwin started with his only bogey of the tournament
when he missed the green and didn't get up and down. He credited
pars on Nos. 3 and 4 as the keys to the victory.
	   ``If I didn't make those pars, there's no telling where I might
have ended up,'' he said. ``Paint me lucky if you want. I'm just
happy I can still win when I'm not playing my best.''
	   Irwin, who was aware of Sigel's fast start, had birdies on Nos.
6 and 8.
	   ``When you see someone six under after eight holes, you know
they are going to be tough to beat,'' Irwin said. ``I don't know
what happened to him down the stretch.''
	   A birdie on 10 _ when Irwin put a sand wedge within a foot (30
centimeters) _ pulled him even with Sigel. The two were still tied
after 14 holes, but Irwin birdied 15 to take the lead for good.
	   ``It's particularly pleasing to successfully defend a
championship,'' said Irwin, who has done so in three tournaments
this year.
	   ``Winning and playing well are on-going goals. I was nervous out
there and I love that. If I were not nervous on the first tee, or
on the 18th green, it might be time to quit.''
	   Sigel entered Sunday's round trailing Irwin and Inman by four
strokes, but he quickly made those up with birdies on six of the
first eight holes.
	   He held a one-shot lead at the turn, when he was 13 under.
	   ``The front nine was pretty neat. I played the backside pretty
well,'' Sigel said. ``But 16 was a hiccup and 18 a `Who knows?'''

Holocaust survivor recalls slave labor; attorney files lawsuit

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As a teen-ager, Elly Gross was waiting her turn
to die at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland when she was
instead sent to work as slave labor for German automaker
Volkswagen.
	   While fortunate to have escaped the Nazi camp where her mother
and 5-year-old brother were gassed to death, Mrs. Gross was forced
to work long hours with no pay and still has trouble breathing from
the paint she inhaled as a youngster.
	   A class-action lawsuit expected to be filed Monday on behalf of
Mrs. Gross and others like her demands compensation for the work of
slave laborers, alleging that Volkswagen not only exploited slave
labor, but worked with the Nazis to ensure its steady supply.
	   In a similar action, attorney Ed Fagan filed a federal lawsuit
Sunday in New York City against several German and Austrian
companies _ including Volkswagen _ over use of slave labor.
	   ``The industrial companies of Germany played an integral role in
the Holocaust,'' Fagan said. ``They masterminded and implemented
with the Nazi regime a ... conspiracy to purposely enslave and
exploit Holocaust victims and to profit from the Holocaust.''
	   Fagan's lawsuit also named Siemans, Krup, Diamler-Benz, Audi,
Wurttembergische Metall Waremfabrik, Heinkel, Eicon Technology, BMW
and Leica Camera.
	   The lawsuits against Volkswagen and other companies follow the
agreement by Swiss banks to settle outstanding Holocaust claims for
dlrs 1.25 billion that were negotiated in part by Fagan and Weiss.
	   ``Nobody can give me back my mother and brother. But they can
make right what they did to me,'' Mrs. Gross, of New York City,
said Sunday.
	   Historians believe more than 7 million people were coerced to
work in Germany under Hitler's regime.
	   The government has so far turned down survivors' demands for
back wages, but Volkswagen said in July it would establish a fund
to pay back wages. Lawyer Mel Weiss, who said he will file the
lawsuit Monday in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, said the
company's proposal was not acceptable.
	   Volkswagen did not immediately return telephone calls seeking
comment to its offices in Germany and the United States.
	   ``Germany has apologized for the Holocaust. This lawsuit is a
test of whether it will put justice where its mouth is,'' Weiss
said.
	   But it's about more than money for Mrs. Gross.
	   In April 1944, 15-year-old Elly Gross, her mother and brother
were loaded on a railroad boxcar from their native Romania for a
six-day trip to Auschwitz.
	   ``When we arrived, people were screaming. Dogs were barking.
Everybody was yelling,'' she said.
	   She was told the family would be reunited in several days. It
never happened. After several months she was shipped to a
Volkswagen factory near Hannover, Germany, were she spent nearly a
year painting machinery parts.
	   ``You have to understand, after what I had been through at
Auschwitz _ sleeping in the mud, eating sand to fill my belly,
watching people die _ the factory was like heaven. We had food and
blankets,'' she said.
	   But the 12-hour work days under the supervision of Nazi guards,
who beat those who made a mistake, took its toll on her health.
	   ``I coughed up the paint,'' said Gross, a 69-year-old retired
bookkeeper who came to the United States in 1966.
	   In the waning days of the war, the factory workers were shipped
to another concentration camp, where she was eventually liberated
by American soldiers. When she returned to Romania, she found
strangers living in her home and learned that her family was dead.
	   While her battle against Volkswagen has just begun, Mrs. Gross
earlier this year closed a door on another part of her past.
	   In April 1998, she returned to Auschwitz. At a camp museum, she
found a picture of her mother and brother standing next to a
boxcar. She believes it was taken shortly after their arrival and
hours before their death.
	   ``I had my family reunion ... on Friday, April 23, 1998 in
Auschwitz,'' she said. ``I promised that day, I would tell
everybody. I promised them everything would be made right.''

Hank Kuehne beats veteran Tom McKnight to win U.S. Amateur
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By BEN DOBBIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, New York, (AP) _ Hank Kuehne, a recovering alcoholic
whose brother lost to Tiger Woods in the 1994 final, overcame
one-time pro Tom McKnight to win the 98th U.S. Amateur championship
Sunday.
	   McKnight's heroics on the green stemmed an early runaway in the
36-hole, match-play duel but, after recovering the lead briefly in
the afternoon, he lost his deft touch and went down 2 and 1 at Oak
Hill.
	   ``It's an unbelievable feeling,'' said Kuehne, 22, of McKinney,
Texas, who is entering his senior year at Southern Methodist
University in Dallas.
	   ``I got to get back to school, I'm a week behind,'' he joked.
	   The Kuehnes have been the most notable family in amateur golf of
late. Kuehne's elder brother and caddy, Trip, lost 2-down to Woods,
an 18-year-old phenomenon in 1994; his sister, Kelli, won the U.S.
Women's Amateur in 1995 and 1996 before turning pro.
	   ``It tops off a long journey,'' Trip Kuehne said. ``Henry (Hank)
had won before he even got here.''
	   Hooked on alcohol in his teens, Kuehne survived a scary car
crash in Oklahoma in February 1995 when he ran a stop sign while
drunk. He survived with broken ribs, entered a clinic and has
stayed sober ever since.
	   ``I didn't want to live like that anymore,'' he said, calling
his family ``the pillar in my recovery, to say the least.''
	   McKnight, 44, operates a chain of 17 ``On the Way'' convenience
stores and gasoline stations in rural southwestern Virginia. He
joined the pro circuit out of college in 1976 but never qualified
for the PGA Tour and quit trying when he dislocated his elbow
playing basketball in 1980.
	   During his year-long recovery, McKnight took on his father's
business, started a family _ he has three teen-age children _ and
regained his amateur status in 1984.
	   To reach the final, McKnight knocked out Spanish sensation
Sergio Garcia, the 18-year-old British Amateur champion who had
toppled defending champion Matt Kuchar in Friday's quarterfinal.
	   Kuehne was 3-up after the morning round and might have been
further ahead but for some drama around the greens.
	   McKnight grabbed the lead on the 2nd hole when he sank a 35-foot
(10-meter) birdie putt and Kuehne missed from 3 feet (one meter).
He bogeyed the next two holes to fall 1-down, drew level with a par
on the 5th, then drove into a creek on the 7th and into the trees
on the 8th to drop 2-down.
	   Kuehne bolted further ahead on the 10th with a 15-foot
(4.5-meter) birdie putt. Although McKnight clawed back on the par-3
11th by chipping in from a front bunker, Kuehne soared to 4-up with
birdies on Nos. 14 and 16.
	   McKnight holed a crucial 20-foot (6-meter) par putt to tie the
17th and closed the gap on the 18th when Kuehne's drive was hemmed
in by trees.
	   Momentum swung right around in the early afternoon. McKnight
dropped an 8-foot (2.5-meter) birdie putt on the 2nd, then drew
level when Kuehne got jammed in a fairway bunker on the 4th and
drove into a 5th-hole creek.
	   But after recovering the lead on the 6th, where he sank an
11-foot birdie (3.3-meter) putt, McKnight missed four short putts
from 5 feet (1.5 meter) on both the 8th and 10th, 2 feet on the
11th and 7 feet on the 12th to again fall 3-down.
	   He benefited from a Kuehne bogey on the 14th, then sank a
30-footer (9-meter) on the 15th to get back to 1-down. On the par-4
17th, however, with Kuehne safely on the green in two, he lipped a
20-foot (6-meter) par putt and conceded the match.

Panama rejects presidential re-election

	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Panamanian voters have rejected a proposed
constitutional change that would allow President Ernesto Perez
Balladares to seek re-election, early results showed Sunday.
	   Reform opponents had asserted Perez Balladares was trying to
hold onto power to put friends of his Democratic Revolutionary
Party in the best position to profit from the Dec. 31, 1999,
handover of the Panama Canal.
	   With 38 percent of polling stations reporting, the anti-reform
side had 62.55 percent of Sunday's vote compared to 35.56 for
reform supporters.
	   More than 1.7 million Panamanians were eligible to vote. Early
results showed the `No' side ahead in nearly every district.
	   The president's backers had argued the change would help Panama
ensure political stability when the country takes control of the
canal and land being vacated by the U.S. military.
	   Panama's constitution restricts the president to one five-year
term, and re-election is only possible if a leader sits out two
terms. The next president will be elected in May and take office in
September, three months before the handover.
	   With Perez Balladares out of the 1999 race, the ruling party's
nomination was up for grabs. Mireya Moscoso of the Arnulfista Party
is the leading opposition candidate.
	   Backed by the business community, the pro-reform side spent
millions of dollars on television and radio commercials and ``Si''
(Yes) flags, T-shirts and banners. A huge street party Friday night
drew tens of thousands of Panamanians.
	   But Rosa de Olive, who voted at a Panama City primary school
where the president also cast his ballot, was confident the
proposed reform would lose.
	   ``Propaganda always does damage,'' she said.
	   The apparent loss could prove embarrassing to Perez Balladares
at a key moment: On Saturday he will preside over a summit of more
than a dozen Latin American presidents.
	   Opponents said the pro-reform campaign had expected to coast to
an easy victory, following the success of similar measures in Peru
and Argentina.
	   But they had urged Panama not to follow the steps of Peru, where
Congress' decision to allow President Alberto Fujimori to seek a
third term set off violent protests last week.
	   They argued that allowing the president to seek a successive
term would weaken democracy, which took hold just nine years ago
after U.S. forces toppled the regime of Gen. Manuel Noriega.
	   Opposition leaders say Panama's system of checks-and-balances is
too weak to keep an autocrat from holding onto power.
	   Many Panamanians say Perez Balladares _ a millionaire economist
who won office with just 33 percent of the vote in 1994 _ has not
done enough to help poor Panamanians.
	   Industry and agricultural workers say they have been left behind
by the administration's push to modernize the service sector. More
than 40 percent of Panama's 2.6 million people live below the
poverty level of dlrs 228 a month for a family of five.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Government-allied troops chased rebels
from their last stronghold in southwest Congo, officials said
Sunday, dealing a major setback to an insurgency aimed at ousting
President Laurent Kabila. Parts of Matadi were reportedly in flames
as Angolan troops fighting on behalf of Kabila marched into the
Congo River port over the weekend, after insurgent fighters
reportedly airlifted their troops out in a hasty retreat. Kabila's
cabinet director, Abdoulaye Yerodia, said the rebels set fire to
the port _ the only major shipping facility serving inland
southwestern Congo. ``This is a signal of what would come if their
plan to take Kinshasa succeeds,'' Yerodia told reporters. Matadi
was the last major town in Congo's southwest controlled by a rebel
coalition that won a string of stunning successes early in the
month-old uprising against Kabila. The rebels accuse Kabila of
corruption and tribalism. (CONGO)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A tentative agreement to approve a new government
under Boris Yeltsin to tackle Russia's political crisis appeared to
collapse within hours Sunday after the Communists said they would
not accept the deal. The Communist turnabout came just after the
government and the opposition said they had reached a deal
following days of tough behind-the-scenes bargaining to call a
political truce. Communist leader Gennady Zuganov said the proposed
pact was rejected by a meeting of his party leadership because
there was no firm guarantee Yeltsin would abide by its provisions.
But he did not rule out further talks. The nationalist Liberal
Democratic Party also said it would not sign the deal. The social
democratic Yabloko party had said from the start that it wouldn't
support Chernmoyrdin's nomination. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Investigators picked through the charred
remains of a Cuban airliner that plowed into a soccer field,
searching on Sunday for clues to the disaster that killed 79
people, including five children playing on the ground. The Tupolev
154 aircraft owned by Cubana de Aviacion burst into flames Saturday
during takeoff, clipping through two homes and an auto mechanic's
shop before slamming into the field 200 yards (182 meters) from a
runway at Quito's Mariscal Sucre International Airport. The plane
was headed to the coastal city of Guayaquil and then on to Havana.
It was carrying 76 passengers and a 14-member crew, said Gen.
Osvaldo Dominguez, director of the Civil Aviation Office. At least
21 passengers reportedly survived the crash. (ECUADOR-AIR CRASH)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members
of his Cabinet have been threatened by Jewish militants who aim to
derail peace talks with the Palestinians, Netanyahu's aide said
Sunday. And Israel radio reported that the Shin Bet internal
security agency believes that the same militants have hatched plans
to strike at the Temple Mount, home to Islam's third holiest
shrine. Netanyahu has met intensively over the past week with
members of the Shin Bet security service, which is in charge of
protecting VIPs after receiving the warnings.The threats are
especially chilling in a country which was traumatized by the
assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in November 1995 by
an ultra-nationalist Jew opposed to handing over land in exchange
for peace with the Palestinians. (ISRAEL-JEWISH MILITANTS)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's flood control headquarters sent an urgent
appeal to soldiers and civilians already worn down from a
summer-long battle against floods, urging them Sunday to keep up
the fight. Another flood crest rolled down the Yangtze River,
China's longest river. It has been hit by the heaviest flooding
since 1954, when more than 30,000 people were killed. This year's
floods have killed more than 3,000 people nationwide. The latest
flood crest, the eighth this summer, passed Chongqing in southwest
China, and waters were rising in Yichang, in central China's Hubei
province, on the middle reaches of the Yangtze, state television
reported Sunday. Flood control officials urged the millions of
people patrolling important dikes along the river and on Dongting
Lake to work hard guarding danger points, People's Daily reported
Sunday. (CHINA-FLOODS)

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bidding for the Monica Lewinsky story could turn
her saga into the highest-priced sex story in history, according to
the New Yorker magazine.
	   The magazine reports in its Sept. 7 issue that the Star tabloid
sent Lewinsky a one-sentence offer promising ``one million dollars
for exclusive rights to her story _ if and when she should decide
to talk publicly.''
	   That bid was topped by publisher HarperCollins, which offered
dlrs 2 million for a book, the magazine said, citing a source
familiar with the offer.
	   Star editor-in-chief Phil Bunton said the price is being pushed
up because the market for sex stories is getting crowded.
	   ``When the (Gennifer) Flowers story first broke, the mainstream
press dumped all over us,'' Bunton said. ``Now they're every bit as
aggressive as we are in chasing the sex details.''
	   Clinton admitted to having an affair years ago with Flowers.
	   Despite the offers, there has been no indication Lewinsky is
willing to sell her story, the New Yorker said.
	   ___
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ More than 600 people queued up for passes
Sunday to a show of 70 paintings by Vincent van Gogh that will open
in Washington on Oct. 4, more than a month away.
	   Some had been standing in line since 6:20 a.m. by the time the
National Gallery of Art opened at 11 a.m. The line stretched around
the huge gallery and back almost to the main entrance.
	   Museum spokeswoman Deborah Ziska said such lines had not been
seen since the gallery featured a unique collection of paintings by
another Dutch master, Johannes Vermeer. Those paintings had never
been exhibited simultaneously in one place.
	   Museum officials are issuing 300 advance passes for each
half-hour until the van Gogh show closes Jan. 3.
	   Passes issued at the gallery are free.
	   The paintings were brought from the Amsterdam's van Gogh museum,
which shuts down Tuesday for renovation. Other pictures in its
collection will be lent to Amsterdam's main gallery, the
Rijksmuseum.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Trading his death mask for oversized glam rock
sunglasses, Marilyn Manson has gone Hollywood _ in spirit and for
real.
	   The outrageous rock star moved to Tinseltown's famed Laurel
Canyon, home to the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison when
they were outrageous rock stars.
	   ``This whole past year, my house has become a real Hollywood
Babylon, Studio 54 type of place,'' Manson says in the Sept. 17
issue of Rolling Stone, adding that he likes to invite
semi-forgotten former stars over for karaoke performances.
	   ``So at any given moment, you may have found Leif Garrett or
Corey Feldman singing the theme from `Grease,''' Manson says.
	   The singer-songwriter often criticized _ and in some cases
banned _ for his unholy, explicit lyrics and walking corpse persona
has traded his blackened-eye-sockets look for lighter makeup and
colorful 1970s outfits featuring platform shoes and Elton
John-style spectacles.
	   Manson's new album ``Mechanical Animals'' (due Sept. 15) is a
big change too, swapping the teen Satanism and hissing,
postindustrial buzzsaw sound from his 1996 album ``Antichrist
Superstar'' for melodic guitar grooves and lyrics about spacey
sci-fi romance fantasies.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ At age 19, ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' star
Natasha Lyonne has already realized her lifelong dream: a Manhattan
apartment.
	   ``The only thing I ever wanted is to own a home in New York,''
Lyonne says in the Sept. 7 People magazine.
	   Lyonne, who began acting on television when she was 6, went on
to a role in the TV soap opera ``As the World Turns'' before making
her screen debut in 1986, in ``Heartburn.''
	   Her breakout role came in 1996, portraying Woody Allen's
daughter in ``Everyone Says I Love You.'' In ``Slums of Beverly
Hills,'' she plays a girl blooming into womanhood whose family
exists as postmodern nomads wandering the Los Angeles landscape.
	   In real life, Lyonne couldn't be happier about putting down
roots.
	   ``I'm testing the American dream,'' says Lyonne, a Great Neck,
New York, native who spent part of her childhood living in Israel.
``I'm just going to watch movies and make movies 'till I die _ even
if people don't want me anymore.''
	   ___
	   WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) _ Merle Haggard was feeling too poorly
to treat country music fans this weekend to longtime favorites like
``Okie from Muskogee.''
	   Haggard was supposed to be the headliner at the Red River Music
Festival on Sunday, but a gum infection forced organizers to
postpone the entire show.
	   ``He can't even talk right now,'' said organizer LoriAnn Bussey.
``There's no sense in the festival going on without Merle.''
	   Other acts agreed to perform at the rescheduled concert on Sept.
13. Ticket holders may use their tickets then or receive a refund.
	   Haggard, a country music staple, broke onto the charts 35 years
ago. His hits include ``Hungry Eyes,'' ``If We Make It Through
December,'' ``Working Man Blues,'' ``Old Man From the Mountain,''
and ``Okie from Muskogee.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A popular Israeli singer said Sunday she has
canceled a performance in a Palestinian city after reports that she
might be attacked by Islamic militants.
	   Zehava Ben told Israel radio she was to have performed in the
West Bank city of Nablus on Thursday, but Israeli police warned her
that the Islamic Hamas group had expressed opposition to her
appearance there.
	   Ben's agent Eli Banai told The Associated Press a leaflet was
distributed in the mosques in Nablus warning that if Ben tried to
enter the city the Palestinians would stop her.
	   Police also received warnings that Hamas might attack Ben or try
to kidnap her if she went ahead with the performance, Israel radio
and Army radio reported.
	   Hamas is opposed to the Oslo agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians, and has killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombings
since the peace process began.
	   Ben is a supporter of reconciliation between the two peoples and
has appeared before in Palestinian cities. ``The most enthusiastic
audiences have been in Nablus,'' she told Israel radio. She sings
in Arabic but said the Palestinians also ask for her Hebrew songs.
	   A concert she was to have given in Gaza some years ago was also
canceled because of safety concerns.

Angolan troops patrol deserted streets in Congo port town

	   MATADI, Congo (AP) _ Angolan troops have been guarding the
strategic Congolese port town of Matadi after rebel forces trying
to oust President Laurent Kabila deserted their positions.
	   The Angolans took control of Matadi over the weekend after the
rebels put up only light resistance before fleeing into the
surrounding forest, Deputy Interior Minister Faustin Munene told
reporters Sunday.
	   The loss of Matadi, one of the last major rebel strongholds, is
a blow to the insurgent force that just weeks ago seemed poised to
take the capital, about 350 kilometers (215 miles) northeast of
here.
	   A fire at Matadi's port _ the only major Congo River port
serving inland southwestern Congo _ raged in one warehouse, but the
shipping facility was otherwise undamaged and city streets were
deserted.
	   Kabila's cabinet director, Abdoulaye Yerodia, earlier had
described major destruction at the port.
	   ``This is a signal of what would come if their plan to take
Kinshasa succeeds,'' Kabila's cabinet director Abdoulaye Yerodia
told reporters.
	   Angolan forces teamed up with Kabila's beleaguered military more
than a week ago and have helped turn the tide against the rebel
force _ a coalition army of ethnic Tutsi fighters and former
soldiers in Kabila's army.
	   Zimbabwe and Namibia are also fighting on behalf of Kabila.
	   Several gunmen from the Angola's UNITA rebel force were arrested
in Matadi, confirming suspicions that Congo's insurgents had been
cooperating with the UNITA movement.
	   ``We came here to protect the legal government of the Democratic
Republic of Congo,'' Angolan chief of army staff Joao De Matos
said. ``We also came to protect the vital interests of Angola.''
	   Kabila in recent days has regained ground nearly as quickly as
it was lost to the rebels _ believed to be backed by neighboring
Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Away from Matadi, Angolan troops also were in control of a
massive power dam at the town of Inga, which provides electricity
to much of southwestern Congo and the neighboring Republic of
Congo.
	   Electricity in Kinshasa was still off due to a technical fault
in the power lines linking to capital to Inga, the dam's director
Daniel Yeuga Massawpu said.
	   The rebels acknowledged the loss of Matadi and Inga.
	   ``We have tactically withdrawn from Matadi and Inga so our
forces can concentrate on Kinshasa,'' the rebel leader Ernest Wamba
dia Wamba said.
	   The capital Kinshasa was quiet Sunday after days of pitched
combat on its western and eastern suburbs left bodies scattered
through the streets and triggered a vicious spree of lynching and
summary executions.
	   Government troops searched door-to-door Sunday in search of
insurgent forces hiding amid the population, Yerodia said. A
dusk-to-dawn remained in effect in Kinshasa, where rebels are still
believed to be holding some positions.
	   Responding to complaints from foreign ambassadors in Kinshasa,
Yerodia defended his military's conduct.
	   ``The reality of this situation is that the front is
everywhere,'' he said. ``The aggressors are hiding in houses and
back alleys in all quarters. If there are fronts everywhere in
Kinshasa, there is war everywhere.''
	   The charred corpses of suspected rebels lie along some streets
in downtown Kinshasa.
	   Officials say hundreds and perhaps thousands of rebel fighters
have surrendered or been killed just in the past few days of
fighting.
	   Rebel leader Jean-Pierre Ondekane, however, remained defiant and
insisted the fight to oust Kabila would continue.
	   Rebel troops slipped past government defenses in various parts
of Kinshasa last week and launched an attack for the airport and
the city's eastern outskirts.
	   Congolese Deputy Interior Minister Munene said rebels still in
positions between Matadi and the capital were putting up a tough
fight.
	   ``There is a lot of resistance from the rebels between Matadi
and Songololo,'' he said. Songololo is about 50 kilometers (30
miles) east of Matadi.

A year later: Princess Diana mourned in public and in private
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RECAPS pvs. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CRATHIE, Scotland (AP) _ A year after Princess Diana's death,
thousands will commemorate one of the most public lives of modern
times, while those who knew her best mark the anniversary of a very
private grief in the seclusion of their Scottish castle.
	   Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13, are with the rest of
the royal family at Balmoral Castle, where their father woke them
last Aug. 31 to tell them of their mother's fatal car crash.
	   While admirers in London pile flowers at the gates of Kensington
Palace and attend memorial services at the city's great cathedrals,
Diana's sons will attend private prayers at the tiny stone church
of Crathie parish, just outside the castle gates and across the
rushing waters of the River Dee.
	   Queen Elizabeth II thanked people who have sent many messages of
sympathy, though the royal website as well as in the mail.
	   ``The queen and the royal family, particularly the Prince of
Wales, Prince William and Prince Harry, would like to thank people
for their messages and kind gestures of sympathy at this sad time
and for sharing their remembrance of the Princess of Wales,'' said
the royal statement.
	   At the Crathie church on Sunday, the royal family heard the Rev.
Robert Sloan pray for them.
	   ``Hear our prayers for those grieving the loss of a loved one in
circumstances known to the world but only experienced by a few,''
Sloan said, as William and Harry sat on either side of Prince
Charles in the front pew.
	   Balmoral, Queen Victoria's ``dear paradise'' of mountains,
moorlands, forests and salmon streams, has been a vacation retreat
for the royal family since 1855 and they visit off and on during
the year, particularly in late summer.
	   But now they have come together en masse, with spouses and
children, to be present for the anniversary of Diana's death. Prime
Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, are at Balmoral for the
annual prime ministerial weekend and were invited to attend the
family prayers Monday morning.
	   Equally privately, Diana's brother, Earl Spencer and her
sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, are
holding a service at Althorp, the family estate 75 miles (120 km)
north of London where Diana was buried on an island in an
ornamental lake. The estate and the museum in Diana's memory closed
for the season on Sunday after receiving 152,000 visitors who paid
up to 9 pounds (dlrs 15.75) each.
	   At St. James's Palace, where Harry and William live in London
with Prince Charles, Diana's former employees and other members of
the royal household are taking part in a service of remembrance in
the chapel where the princess's coffin rested before her funeral.
	   The national flag, the Union Jack, is to be flown all day at
half staff on government buildings and royal residences. Some
businesses are closed because the day is, coincidentally, a
``bank'' holiday
	   Memorial services at St. Paul's Anglican cathedral and at
Westminster Roman Catholic cathedral are open to all. And
individuals are free to make their own informal observances at
Kensington Palace, where hundreds took bouquets as the anniversary
approached.
	   Diana's face appeared on front pages of most of the national
newspapers on Sunday, and half a dozen special programs were
offered on television.
	   A granite and bronze sculpture of Diana and Dodi Fayed, the
lover with whom
	   she died, will be unveiled Monday at Harrods, the London store
owned by Fayed's
	   father.
	   But public commemorations seem modest, and recent opinion polls
have indicated many believe the mourning last year was excessive.
	   The Daily Telegraph on Friday published the results of a
telephone survey by Gallup which found that 94 percent of those
questioned said they had no plans to mark the anniversary. While 28
percent wanted the day to be an occasion for national remembrance,
69 percent thought it should be left for individuals to mark as
they choose.
	   The survey of 1,009 people had a margin of error of three
percentage points.

	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Panamanian voters have rejected a proposed
constitutional change that would allow President Ernesto Perez
Balladares to seek re-election, early results showed Sunday.
	   Reform opponents had asserted Perez Balladares was trying to
hold onto power to put friends of his Democratic Revolutionary
Party in the best position to profit from the Dec. 31, 1999,
handover of the Panama Canal.
	   With 39 percent of polling stations reporting, the anti-reform
side had 62.55 percent of Sunday's vote compared to 35.56 for
reform supporters.
	   More than 1.7 million Panamanians were eligible to vote. The
`No' side appeared ahead in nearly every district.
	   The government said it would honor the results.
	   ``We have given a lesson in civic duty,'' Labor Minister
Mitchell Doens said.
	   Reform opponents drove through the capital's streets Sunday
night honking their horns in celebration.
	   The president's backers had argued the change would help Panama
ensure political stability when the country takes control of the
canal and land being vacated by the U.S. military.
	   Panama's constitution restricts the president to one five-year
term, and re-election is only possible if a leader sits out two
terms. The next president will be elected in May and take office in
September, three months before the handover.
	   With Perez Balladares out of the 1999 race, the ruling party's
nomination was up for grabs. Mireya Moscoso of the Arnulfista Party
is the leading opposition candidate.
	   A celebrating Moscoso said Panama had given ``a resounding `No'
to the personal aspirations of the president, who wanted to
perpetuate his stay in power.''
	   ``The people want change,'' she said.
	   Many Panamanians say Perez Balladares _ a millionaire economist
who won office with just 33 percent of the vote in 1994 _ has not
done enough to help poor Panamanians.
	   Industry and agricultural workers say they have been left behind
by the administration's push to modernize the service sector. More
than 40 percent of Panama's 2.6 million people live below the
poverty level of dlrs 228 a month for a family of five.
	   Backed by the business community, the pro-reform side spent
millions of dollars on television and radio commercials and ``Si''
(Yes) flags, T-shirts and banners. A huge street party Friday night
drew tens of thousands of Panamanians.
	   But Rosa de Olive, who voted at a Panama City primary school
where the president also cast his ballot, was confident the
proposed reform would lose.
	   ``Propaganda always does damage,'' she said.
	   The apparent loss could prove embarrassing to Perez Balladares
at a key moment: On Saturday he will preside over a summit of more
than a dozen Latin American presidents.
	   Opponents said the pro-reform campaign had expected to coast to
an easy victory, following the success of similar measures in Peru
and Argentina.
	   But they had urged Panama not to follow the steps of Peru, where
Congress' decision to allow President Alberto Fujimori to seek a
third term set off violent protests last week.
	   They argued that allowing the president to seek a successive
term would weaken democracy, which took hold just nine years ago
after U.S. forces toppled the regime of Gen. Manuel Noriega.
	   Panama's system of checks-and-balances is not yet strong enough
to keep an autocrat from holding onto power, they said.

Chamblee win first PGA event.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SURREY, British Columbia (AP) _ Brandel Chamblee made a 36-foot
(10-meters) birdie putt on the final hole of the dlrs 2 million
Greater Vancouver Open on Sunday to cap a 5-under-par 66 that gave
him his first PGA Tour victory.
	   Chamblee had a 19-under 265 total, three strokes better than
third-round leader Payne Stewart, who closed with a 70 on the
6,893-yard (6,300-meter) Northview Golf -and- Country Club course.
	   Chamblee, 36, who earned dlrs 360,000 for the win, had won dlrs
301,846 this year in 20 events.
	   For Stewart, who had a one-stroke lead after 54 holes, it was
the 23rd time in his career that the former U.S. Open and PGA
champion finished second.
	   Lee Porter closed with a 66 and was alone in third at 271, one
stroke ahead of Brian Claar, who had a 67.
	   Stewart, who also led the tournament after an opening-round 64,
started strong Sunday, making birdies on the first two holes then
making a great sand save for par on No. 3.
	   Chamblee, a co-leader after the second round, birdied No. 12 to
move into a tie with Stewart, then took the lead on 14 when Stewart
missed a par putt.
	   It was another disappointing finish at the GVO for Stewart, who
hasn't won a tournament since the 1995 Houston Open. He started the
final round last year one shot off the lead but finished tied for
sixth.

Sakura Bank shares to be suspended on capital increase report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange said Monday it would
temporarily suspend trading in shares of Sakura Bank Ltd. to
confirm a newspaper report that the major commercial bank was
considering an emergency capital increase.
	   The Nihon Keizai, Japan's leading business daily, reported
Monday that Sakura was considering a capital boost of around 300
billion yen (dlrs 2.1 billion) with the help of Toyota Motor Corp.,
Mitsui &AMP; Co., Mitsui Fudosan Co. and some 10 other companies in the
Mitsui group.
	   Sakura is the group's main bank.
	   A Sakura Bank spokesman was unable to immediately confirm the
report. But he said: ``We are moving toward such a direction, and
hope to make some kind of announcement as soon as possible today
(Monday).''
	   The bank later scheduled a press conference at 11 a.m. (0200
GMT).
	   In the front-page article, the newspaper said the move could be
just the first of many private sector-led efforts to forestall a
crisis in Japan's financial system.
	   The move comes as a government plan for a taxpayer-financed
bailout of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. has
been criticized by opposition parties.
	   It is also designed to strengthen the bank amid Japan's `big
bang' deregulation of its financial industry and to make it easier
for Sakura to tie-up with a foreign partner or enter new fields of
business, the report said.

American sprinters leave ``new Christie'' third
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RECAPS pvs.
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ The new Linford Christie came third.
	   The best of British sprinting faced a team of American maybes
Sunday and Tim Harden and Vince Henderson left European champion
Darren Campbell in third place.
	   Harden and Henderson finished 1-2, both clocking 10.32 into the
strong headwind at the Scotstoun Stadium and beating newly-crowned
European titlist Campbell, the sprinter who is being dubbed the
``new Linford Christie.''
	   Coached by former Olympic titlist Christie, Campbell came home
third in 10.37.
	   ``We had to run into a headwind but it was a good competitive
race with my fellow countrymen,'' said Harden, who is due to
compete for the United States at the Grand Prix final in Moscow and
the World Cup in South Africa.
	   ``I felt good. I just got over here (to Europe) so I'm probably
a little bit fresher than the other guys.''
	   In a Britain vs. United States international meet, the home
nation won the 200 and 400 races while world record holder Colin
Jackson edged world and Olympic champion Allen Johnson in a
showdown between the two 110 meter hurdlers.
	   Running into the headwind, Jackson pulled away from Johnson off
the last hurdle at the Scotstoun Stadium to cross the line in 13.40
seconds. Johnson, who has beaten Jackson in the major championships
over the past four years, placed second in 13.42.
	   ``I'm on top of my game and I'm very pleased with that result,''
the Welshman said. ``There are plenty of competitions still left,
the World Cup, the Commonwealth Games and four of five Grand Prix
meetings. So there is a lot of battling to do.''
	   Doug Turner charged clear of world indoor 200-meter titlist
Kevin Little to win the 200 in 20.63 seconds. The American placed
second in 21.17. Britain's leading 200-meter star, Doug Walker, was
absent after surgery Friday to remove damaged knee cartilage.
	   Iwan Thomas charged past early leader Butch Reynolds, the world
record holder, coming off the final bend of the 400 meters and then
held off a late charge by Milton Campbell to win in 45.13.
	   Campbell took second in 45.16 and Reynolds, who says he aims get
back to his competitive best next season after a spell of low-key
performances, clocked 45.54.
	   An American quartet of Kareem Streete-Thompson, Tony McCall,
Allen Johnson and Harden clocked a fast 38.47 to win the 400-meter
relay and the U.S. also took the 1,600 relay.
	   A blunder by Britain's Jamie Baulch, who slowed and repeatedly
looked over his shoulder while leading near the end of the third
leg, game Thomas too much to do against Campbell.
	   The Americans, hurdling star Kevin Young, Woody, Tony Wheeler
and Campbell, won in 3:04.96. Despite the two relay triumphs, a
comparatively weak U.S. team lost the match 141 points to 132
against a British lineup close to full strength.

Russian parliament to consider Chernomyrdin nomination
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RECAPS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia faced more political uncertainty Monday as
parliament prepared to open debate on the nomination of Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
	   Against a backdrop of economic collapse, key parliamentary
leaders, led by the Communists, rejected a proposed truce agreement
Sunday that would have paved the way for 18 months of political
peace.
	   The apparent breakdown appeared likely to usher in a period of
political head-butting similar to the one that surrounded the
nomination of the previous prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, last
spring. This time, though, the economic situation is substantially
worse.
	   Government and opposition leaders had agreed on a pact earlier
Sunday under which parliament would approve the new government and
give it a chance to solve the economic crisis. In return, President
Boris Yeltsin was to give parliament a much bigger role in
selecting the Cabinet.
	   Within hours, however, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov had
backed off, saying his party's leadership could not support the
pact because there was no firm guarantee Yeltsin would abide by its
provisions. He said the Communists would vote against
Chernomyrdin's nomination.
	   Under the constitution, the lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, can vote three times on a prime minister's nomination. In the
case of Kiriyenko, the Communist-led Duma twice voted no, then
caved in on the third vote after trying to wrest concessions from
the government.
	   Zyuganov kept up his rhetorical pressure on Yeltsin on Sunday,
telling the television program ``Itogi'': ``Let Yeltsin's family
convince him to resign and not to drag the entire country into the
grave by his bony hand.''
	   However, he did not rule out further talks on a power-sharing
agreement.
	   The nationalist Liberal Democratic Party joined the Communists
in vowing not to sign the deal, as did the social democratic
Yabloko party. Yabloko leaders had said from the start that they
wouldn't support Chernomyrdin's nomination.
	   The political stalemate couldn't come at a worse time for the
Russian government, which is trying to stabilize an economy that
has been seriously damaged by the devaluation of the national
currency, the ruble, and the government's default on its debts.
	   Chernomyrdin said swift formation of a new government was vital
to tackle the crisis.
	   ``We must resolve financial problems. The ruble is hanging by a
thread,'' he said. ``So if we have a political agreement and the
president accepts it _ let's start working.''
	   The proposed three-page agreement would have given the State
Duma, parliament's lower house, more say in Cabinet appointments,
but leave Yeltsin with substantial power, despite earlier
opposition calls for his removal.
	   In particular, the president would have retained control of the
security forces with the right to fill three key posts _ the
defense, foreign and interior ministries. In exchange, Yeltsin
would have agreed to Duma approval of most Cabinet appointments for
the first time, according to lawmakers and media reports.
	   The draft, which was not made public, would also have obliged
both sides to maintain a political truce. The Duma would not try to
vote the government out of power until parliament's term ends in
late 1999, while Yeltsin would not use his right to dissolve the
legislature _ although he apparently would not lose this power.
	   But the deal was on paper only and Yeltsin would have retained
his powers to dissolve the Duma.
	   The ruble appeared to gain Sunday and exchange points across
Moscow were buying U.S. dollars at an average 8 rubles, giving them
a value of 12.5 cents, down from an average 8.5 rubles to the
dollar the day before. The rate had been 6 rubles to the dollar
before the collapse.
	   There had been no immediate confirmation that Yeltsin would
accept the deal, even though it left him with a firm grip on power.
But he appeared reluctant to accept many of the provisions,
according to Russia media.

	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Panamanian voters have rejected a proposed
constitutional change that would allow President Ernesto Perez
Balladares to seek re-election, according to early results.
	   Reform opponents had asserted Perez Balladares was trying to
hold onto power to put friends of his Democratic Revolutionary
Party in the best position to profit from the Dec. 31, 1999,
handover of the Panama Canal.
	   With 39 percent of polling stations reporting on Sunday, the
anti-reform side had 62.55 percent of Sunday's vote compared to
35.56 for reform supporters.
	   More than 1.7 million Panamanians were eligible to vote. The
`No' side appeared ahead in nearly every district.
	   Ruling party leaders said they would honor the results.
	   ``We have given a lesson in civic duty,'' former Labor Minister
Mitchell Doens said.
	   Reform opponents drove through the capital's streets Sunday
night honking their horns in celebration.

South African soldiers to help with Lesotho vote recount
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South African soldiers started
arriving Sunday in the mountain kingdom of Lesotho to help recount
votes from an election earlier this year, officials said.
	   The soldiers are to relieve South African students who worked
over the weekend to recount ballots that are being contested by
opposition parties in Lesotho.
	   South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki asked the soldiers
to replace the students who had to return to lectures on Monday.
	   One hundred soldiers would participate in the recount, said
Mbeki spokesman Ricky Naidoo.
	   Air Force spokeswoman Lt. Col. Laverne Machine said 15 soldiers
flew to Lesotho's capital, Maseru, on Sunday and the remaining 85
would arrive on Monday.
	   Students started the recount on Saturday in a proposal
negotiated by Mbeki last week during hours of discussion with
opposition parties and the government.
	   The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy won 79 out of the 80
seats in the National Assembly in the May elections that were
monitored by opposition parties and certified by independent
election observers from abroad as having been free and fair.
	   But the three main opposition parties _ the Basotholand Congress
Party, the Basotho National Party and the Marematlou Freedom Party
_ have refused to accept the results and have paralyzed the capital
of Maseru with violent demonstrations several times since early
August.
	   Lesotho's Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and his ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy Party have agreed to step down if
serious flaws are found in examination of the balloting.
	   Surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho is a nation of 2 million
that has long been plagued by political upheaval and the passing of
power back and forth between military and elected governments.
	   Members of the royal family have even taken opposite sides in
the struggles.

IRA calls on car bombers to disband `sooner rather than later'

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republican Army has
called on truce-defying dissidents to disband ``sooner rather than
later'' after they committed Northern Ireland's most lethal
terrorist atrocity.
	   A lengthy statement from an unnamed IRA spokesman was
distributed to journalists Monday three days before its publication
in the weekly IRA-Sinn Fein newspaper An Phoblacht/Republican News.
	   The dissidents claimed responsibility for an Aug. 15 car bomb in
the town of Omagh that killed 28 civilians and wounded more than
330. They also announced that they had ``suspended'' operations,
one step below the formal cease-fire being observed by the outlawed
IRA since July 1997.
	   ``They should disband and they should do so sooner rather than
later,'' the spokesman was quoted as saying about the dissidents,
who call themselves simply the IRA and have been dubbed the
``Real'' IRA by Irish media.
	   ``This grouping have done only disservice to the republican
cause. They have no coherent political strategy. They are not a
credible alternative to the Irish Republican Army.''
	   The IRA spokesman confirmed that the founders of the diehard
faction had resigned from the IRA's ruling executive in October
after being outvoted in a secret meeting in Ireland's remote
northwest.
	   ``Their views on future strategy and direction were rejected by
the vast majority of those delegates,'' the spokesman said.
	   The dissidents opposed the cease-fire _ called to permit the
IRA's allied Sinn Fein party to enter talks with other Northern
Ireland parties _ on grounds that it would never achieve the IRA's
goal of abolishing Northern Ireland as a Protestant-majority state.
	   ``Having failed in what was essentially a bid for leadership,

organization and, in a very deliberate and calculated way, set
about trying to undermine'' Sinn Fein and the IRA, the spokesman
said.
	   The Belfast agreement struck in April and accepted by Sinn Fein
envisioned a new government for a Northern Ireland still firmly
linked with Britain, and committed the IRA to disarming by
mid-2000. But the spokesman said that the dissidents had won few
converts from the IRA, which he emphasized had no intentions of
disarming regardless of the agreement.
	   ``The reality is they are very few in numbers and have little or
no support base, particularly in the occupied counties,'' said the
spokesman, referring to Northern Ireland.
	   The spokesman also rejected speculation that wavering IRA
members had helped the dissidents by lending them explosives,
detonators or other technical support.
	   ``Arguably, actions that this grouping have carried out have
been designed and timed not only to derail the peace process, but
also specifically to damage our struggle. It is ridiculous for
anyone to suggest we would assist them in that.''

IRA calls on car bombers to disband `sooner rather than later'

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republican Army has
called on truce-defying dissidents to disband ``sooner rather than
later'' after they committed Northern Ireland's most lethal
terrorist atrocity.
	   A lengthy statement from an unnamed IRA spokesman was
distributed to journalists Monday three days before its publication
in the weekly IRA-Sinn Fein newspaper An Phoblacht/Republican News.
	   The dissidents claimed responsibility for an Aug. 15 car bomb in
the town of Omagh that killed 28 civilians and wounded more than
330. They also announced that they had ``suspended'' operations,
one step below the formal cease-fire being observed by the outlawed
IRA since July 1997.
	   ``They should disband and they should do so sooner rather than
later,'' the spokesman was quoted as saying about the dissidents,
who call themselves simply the IRA and have been dubbed the
``Real'' IRA by Irish media.
	   ``This grouping have done only disservice to the republican
cause. They have no coherent political strategy. They are not a
credible alternative to the Irish Republican Army.''
	   The IRA spokesman confirmed that the founders of the diehard
faction had resigned from the IRA's ruling executive in October
after being outvoted in a secret meeting in Ireland's remote
northwest.
	   ``Their views on future strategy and direction were rejected by
the vast majority of those delegates,'' the spokesman said.
	   The dissidents opposed the cease-fire _ called to permit the
IRA's allied Sinn Fein party to enter talks with other Northern
Ireland parties _ on grounds that it would never achieve the IRA's
goal of abolishing Northern Ireland as a Protestant-majority state.
	   ``Having failed in what was essentially a bid for leadership,
this small number of individuals then resigned from our
organization and, in a very deliberate and calculated way, set
about trying to undermine'' Sinn Fein and the IRA, the spokesman
said.
	   The Belfast agreement struck in April and accepted by Sinn Fein
envisioned a new government for a Northern Ireland still firmly
linked with Britain, and committed the IRA to disarming by
mid-2000. But the spokesman said that the dissidents had won few
converts from the IRA, which he emphasized had no intentions of
disarming regardless of the agreement.
	   ``The reality is they are very few in numbers and have little or
no support base, particularly in the occupied counties,'' said the
spokesman, referring to Northern Ireland.
	   The spokesman also rejected speculation that wavering IRA
members had helped the dissidents by lending them explosives,
detonators or other technical support.
	   ``Arguably, actions that this grouping have carried out have

also specifically to damage our struggle. It is ridiculous for

	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Panamanian voters have rejected a proposed
constitutional change that would allow President Ernesto Perez
Balladares to seek re-election, according to early results.
	   Reform opponents had asserted Perez Balladares was trying to
hold onto power to put friends of his Democratic Revolutionary
Party in the best position to profit from the Dec. 31, 1999,
handover of the Panama Canal.
	   With 64 percent of polling stations reporting by late Sunday,
the anti-reform side had 62.8 percent of Sunday's vote compared to
35.36 for reform supporters _ or 454,745 votes to 256,595.
	   More than 1.7 million Panamanians were eligible to vote. The
`No' side appeared ahead in nearly every district.
	   Ruling party leaders said they would honor the results.
	   ``We have given a lesson in civic duty,'' former Labor Minister
Mitchell Doens said.
	   Reform opponents drove through the capital's streets Sunday
night honking their horns in celebration.
	   The president's backers had argued the change would help Panama
ensure political stability when the country takes control of the
canal and land being vacated by the U.S. military.
	   Panama's constitution restricts the president to one five-year
term, and re-election is only possible if a leader sits out two
terms. The next president will be elected in May and take office in
September, three months before the handover.
	   With Perez Balladares out of the 1999 race, the ruling party's
nomination was up for grabs. Mireya Moscoso of the Arnulfista Party
is the leading opposition candidate.
	   A celebrating Moscoso said Panama had given ``a resounding `No'
to the personal aspirations of the president, who wanted to
perpetuate his stay in power.''
	   ``The people want change,'' she said.
	   Many Panamanians say Perez Balladares _ a millionaire economist
who won office with just 33 percent of the vote in 1994 _ has not
done enough to help poor Panamanians.
	   Industry and agricultural workers say they have been left behind
by the administration's push to modernize the service sector. More
than 40 percent of Panama's 2.6 million people live below the
poverty level of dlrs 228 a month for a family of five.
	   Backed by the business community, the pro-reform side spent
millions of dollars on television and radio commercials and ``Si''
(Yes) flags, T-shirts and banners. A huge street party Friday night
drew tens of thousands of Panamanians.
	   But Rosa de Olive, who voted at a Panama City primary school
where the president also cast his ballot, was confident the
proposed reform would lose.
	   ``Propaganda always does damage,'' she said.
	   The apparent loss could prove embarrassing to Perez Balladares
at a key moment: On Saturday he will preside over a summit of more
than a dozen Latin American presidents.
	   Opponents said the pro-reform campaign had expected to coast to
an easy victory, following the success of similar measures in Peru
and Argentina.
	   But they had urged Panama not to follow the steps of Peru, where
Congress' decision to allow President Alberto Fujimori to seek a
third term set off violent protests last week.
	   They argued that allowing the president to seek a successive
term would weaken democracy, which took hold just nine years ago
after U.S. forces toppled the regime of Gen. Manuel Noriega.
	   Panama's system of checks-and-balances is not yet strong enough
to keep an autocrat from holding onto power, they said.

Secretary of state comes under pressure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BIJELJINA, Bosnia (AP) _ In Europe, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright finds herself under pressure for a U.S. foreign
policy that appears sometimes hesitant or short on delivery.
	   From the House Speaker Newt Gingrich, to Washington analysts,
Albright is taking the heat at home for an administration burdened
with President Bill Clinton's personal problems and the political
constraints they have brought.
	   Admired at the outset for a forceful, plain-speaking style
designed both to make clear America's objectives to foreign leaders
and the American people, Albright's performance is now being
questioned.
	   On Sunday, in the Balkans, she persisted in carrying a U.S.
message of democracy to governments that are reluctant to move in
that direction.
	   Albright cited progress in reconstructing the Bosnian Serb
republic as evidence that patience pays off.
	   ``I am very encouraged by the kind of progress we are making
here,'' she said after inspecting a rebuilt feeder substation in
Bijeljina, which is supplying electricity to 110,000 people as well
as three industrial zones.
	   The United States spent dlrs 1.6 million for work on the project
and on restoring water supply to the area. Albright, at a news
conference, said dlrs 100 million in assistance would go to the
republic this year and that aid to refugees in Yugoslavia's Kosovo
province would be boosted from dlrs 10 million to dlrs 30 millon.
	   Earlier, in Croatia, she lectured President Franjo Tudjman on
the pace of return of ethnic Serb refugees, for a press that is
still partly under government control and for Croatia's close ties
to ethnic Croats in Bosnia.
	   ``Bosnian Croats have to be able to act independently,''
Albright said, referring to the uphill U.S.-led effort to establish
a diversified, peaceful state from often clashing communities in
Bosnia.
	   Tudjman resisted. At a joint news conference, he said Croats in
Bosnia should not be denied their ``mark of identity,'' thereby
conjuring up the notion of a ``greater Croatia'' at Bosnia's
expense.
	   On Monday, she joins President Bill Clinton at the Moscow
summit. It will be an awesome test of the administration's juggling
of support for beleaguered President Boris Yeltsin and political
and economic reform as the goverment tries to restore stability
with a return to some state controls.
	   All the while, Albright and U.S. foreign policy on several
fronts are under challenge.
	   Threats to use force against the Serbs for a bloody offensive
against ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province remain
only that _ threats.
	   Even so, on Sunday, in Bijeljina, Albright again warned the
Serbs, ``there is the potential use of force,'' and said she would
meet in Sarajevo on Monday with Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO
commander.
	   ``Neither the United States nor the European allies can tolerate
much longer'' what is going on in Kosovo, she said.
	   Earlier, threats to compel President Saddam Hussein to submit to
unfettered U.N. searches for illegal weapons caches in Iraq also
remained only threats.
	   ``If necessary, we will use force on our timetable.'' Albright
warned Aug. 14, even as her opposition to certain weapons searches
was emerging. Responding to critics, she said she had been
concerned about a deep split in the U.N. Security Council.
	   Scott Ritter, an American inspector, quit in protest, and
Speaker Newt Gingrich said Albright may have misled Clinton or the
public by advising U.N. monitors to avoid a collision with Iraq.
	   Gingrich also is challenging Clinton's decision to go ahead with
the summit in Moscow. Calling the trip ``imprudent,'' he asked:
``who knows what kind of promises they will make to each other.''
	   Albright's plain-speaking style is also at issue in the Middle
East, where peacemaking between Israel and the Arabs is at a
standstill.
	   Through it all, though, Albright is trudging along, faithfully
serving her president.

Survey: Australian business confidence falls sharply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian business expectations for
the September quarter fell sharply with the Asian currency turmoil
hitting home, a survey released Monday showed.
	   The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said its
national survey of business expectations had fallen from an index
of 48.9 to 39.9.
	   That reflected the consensus in business that Australian
economic growth would slow from the rate of 4.9 percent achieved in
the year to March.
	   ``A growth rate of around half that level now looks a far more
likely outcome for 1998-99,'' the Chamber said.
	   ``The catastrophic fall in output in the Asian region, which is
spreading to markets around the world, must have a detrimental
impact on business confidence.''
	   It said exports appeared hardest hit with a negative 10.8 net
balance.
	   For employment there was a negative net balance of 5.1 in the
last quarter, with expectations it would further deteriorate in the
coming quarter.
	   But sales and investment were more positive, indicating the
economy was showing resilience in the face of the external
problems.
	   The sales expectation figure showed a positive net balance of
14.1, while investment expectations held a positive net balance of
5.8.

Mexicans vote on controversial bank bailout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A referendum by a leftist opposition party at
improvised polling booths across Mexico revealed continuing
resistance to a government proposal for taxpayers to pay for a dlrs
60 billion bank bailout.
	   The non-binding referendum on Sunday organized by the Democratic
Revolution Party, is part of an unusual challenge to the government
proposal, in a country where the ruling party's 69-year grip on
power has often allowed presidents to impose unpopular measures.
	   ``It's not in our best interest to pay for the debts of other
people,'' said Adan Castillo, a member of a leftist bus drivers'
union, as he cast his ballot in Mexico City's main square.
	   Hoping to increase its political leverage, the Democratic
Revolution spent about dlrs 1 million in a flashy media campaign
before the referendum. None of those interviewed as they waited to
cast their ballots said they supported the government proposal.
	   The party, known as the PRD, opposes a government program that
bought about dlrs 60 billion in past-due loans from private banks
following the 1994 peso devaluation in order to keep the banks from
failing.
	   The government has countered with television ads claiming the
program was needed to prevent a costly and damaging collapse of the
nation's financial system.
	   Marco Provencio, a spokesman for the Finance Secretariat, called
the referendum ``an exercise in manipulation'' that ``sought to
falsify the government position.''
	   The PRD estimated it set up about 15,000 booths throughout the
nation, where voters could choose to approve a paraphrased version
of President Ernesto Zedillo's proposal, or a PRD alternative.
	   The PRD said it would release final results of the referendum on
Monday, just a day before Zedillo delivers his State of the Nation
address before an opposition-led congress.
	   In Mexico City's main square, thousands of laid-off workers _
including Castillo, whose bus union was dissolved by the government
in 1995 _ and PRD sympathizers stood in long lines to cast their
votes.
	   Both the PRD and the right-center National Action Party oppose
the bailout, which they say benefits wealthy businessmen and
bankers with government ties.
	   Gerardo Fernandez Norona, president of a nationwide debtors'
group that opposes the bailout, voted for the PRD's proposal.
	   ``The government's proposal does not solve the nation's economic
problems, but our vote does not constitute a blank check to the
PRD,'' he said.
	   ``I cannot vote for the people who stole all that money,''
shopkeeper Antonieta Martinez said.
	   In the upscale Polanco district, smaller numbers of voters also
rejected Zedillo's bailout proposal.
	   Pilar Pellicer, a popular actress, said she had voted for the
PRD's proposal because it seemed more sensible.
	   ``The government's proposal is unconvincing; it favors bankers
and certain financial groups,'' she said.

Wounded President Yeltsin hopes for Clinton embrace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ When Boris Yeltsin last welcomed U.S. President
Bill Clinton to Moscow, the Russian president was nearing the end
of a desperate race for re-election. This time, he's fighting a
no-less-desperate battle to rescue his country from economic ruin
and his reputation from deeper disrepute.
	   In April 1996, Clinton gave his friend a boost by supporting his
plan to end the Chechen war and praising his economic reform
efforts.
	   This time as well, Yeltsin will be looking for a boost. He's
hoping the photo ops with Clinton will buff his credentials as a
member of the elite club of world leaders _ what many see as his
last political straw.
	   ``Yeltsin is worse than a lame duck,'' said Igor Bunin, an
analyst at the Center for Political Technologies in Moscow.
``Clinton is supporting Yeltsin by inertia. It's no longer support
of a concrete person _ it's fear of catastrophe.''
	   At 67, Yeltsin is showing his age and the effects of his heart
disease, back injury and other ailments. Some days, he walks
rigidly and seems to have trouble settling into a chair. On others,
he talks with exaggerated diction and drama, suggesting he's on
medication or inspiring rumors that he's drinking excessively. At
times he appears to struggle to understand what's said to him.
	   There are no indications, however, that he's mortally ill.
	   Yeltsin's political health is another story. He played a heroic
role in 1991, leading Russia into a new, democratic and
market-oriented age after decades of communism. But he hasn't had
the wherewithal to take on the pervasive corruption that has robbed
the country of its riches. And he has proved unable to sustain the
nation's hopes through cyclical economic troubles _ including this
summer's financial collapse.
	   Few trust Yeltsin to pull Russia out of its most serious
economic distress since market reforms were launched seven years
ago, and calls mounted last week for his resignation.
	   ``Boris Yeltsin has turned all of his forces to forever keeping
up his readiness for battle. To simply preserving himself in power.
Power for power's sake. Power, period,'' wrote the editor-in-chief
of the Itogi weekly, Sergei Parkhomenko.
	   Yeltsin long ago lost his almost legendary democratic shine. He
and his advisers blundered time and again in the 22-month war in
Chechnya, which cost tens of thousands of lives. He has a mercurial
history of setting his aides against one another, and shifting the
blame onto them when things don't go right.
	   For many Russians, Yeltsin lost his last shred of credibility
when he announced on Aug. 14 that there would be no devaluation of
the ruble; a de facto devaluation came three days later. Within two
weeks he was forced to go on national television to deny rumors he
would resign.
	   Talking with his aides, you'd never know he was so besieged. His
inner circle of true believers remain almost blindly loyal,
insisting that despite his plunging popularity in public opinion
polls and long periods out of the public eye, he's strong enough to
rule.
	   ``I think he's in good form. I can certify that his authority is
as great as it was earlier,'' said Alexander Livshits, Yeltsin's
economic adviser who resigned Aug. 17 to take responsibility for
the government's failed attempts to stabilize the economy. Livshits
still considers himself part of the Yeltsin team.
	   Yeltsin's supporters seem unable _ or unwilling _ to conceive of
any viable successors. They say that the two most likely contenders
for the president's seat in 2000, Gen. Alexander Lebed and Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, can't be trusted to protect Russians' civil
liberties.
	   Certainly neither candidate _ nor Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
acting prime minister whom Yeltsin has identified as a possible
successor _ would have any room in his entourage for aides tainted
in the public eye by their association with Yeltsin.
	   Even Yeltsin's old friends seem to be distancing themselves as
the president's fortunes decline. Clinton, who has offered moral
support for years, has adopted the line that the United States is
interested in how Russia is run _ not who, in particular, runs it.

	   Key points of a draft political agreement between the Russian

collapse within hours Sunday after the Communists said they would
not support it:
	   _ Parliament would not initiate a no-confidence vote in the
government or seek to impeach the president before its term expires
in late 1999. President Boris Yeltsin would not use his right to
disband parliament.
	   _ Prime minister would appoint Cabinet ministers in consultation
with parliament. Yeltsin would keep the right to propose candidates
for prime minister and appoint the ministers of defense, security
and foreign affairs. Parliament would approve other government
appointments and dismissals.
	   _ The media law would be changed to allow for increased public
control over state-run television and radio outlets.
	   _ Parliament would give priority to discussing the Cabinet's
anti-crisis program.

At crunch time, Duval runs away with World Series title

	   AKRON, Ohio (AP) _ Less than a year ago, there were some who
questioned whether David Duval could win on the PGA Tour.
	   Now he is arguably the best young player in the world.
	   Over the last 11 months he has won six times and collected more
than dlrs 3.3 million, stashing dlrs 405,000 more into his wallet
Sunday by winning the NEC World Series of Golf.
	   ``I believe in what I do,'' Duval said after he kept all
challengers at arm's length with a 2-under-par 68 that left him at
11-under 269 and two shots ahead of 1996 World Series champion Phil
Mickelson. ``I always stayed true to the course I wanted to follow,
even when people questioned it and didn't think I could win.''
	   The World Series was his third win this year _ more than anyone
else on tour. With more than dlrs 2 million earned in 1998, he now
leads the money list.
	   Since he will defend the three consecutive starts he won late
last year, don't be surprised if he pushes the envelope for
earnings to the dlrs 3 million stratosphere.
	   ``Yeah, I absolutely could. But to do that I would have to win
the Tour Championship,'' said the defending champion of that title.
``First place there is something like dlrs 720,000 and that would
put me up high, to dlrs 2.7 or dlrs 2.8 million and I'd have to
play well in the other events I'm playing. But it's a
possibility.''
	   Duval started the final round with a one-shot lead over local
favorite John Cook, then poured in a downhill 15-footer (4.5
meters) for an eagle on the par-5 2nd hole.
	   ``His eagle at No. 2 was kind of a little springboard for him,''
said Cook, who shot a 71 to finish alone in fourth at 273. ``It
really eliminated about four or five guys right there.''
	   ``I know as a competitor you don't ever quit,'' Duval said,
``but certainly that makes it that much more difficult for somebody
starting three, four or five shots back to get excited about their
chances.''
	   Duval parred the next seven holes _ while holding on to the same
two-shot lead _ but bogeyed the par-4 11th when his chip from just
off the back of the green rolled 25 (8 meters) feet past the hole.
	   Mickelson was within a shot but was stuck in the midst of a
string of 14 straight pars.
	   Duval ended the drama by rolling in a 12-foot (3.5-meter) birdie
putt at 13 and following that with a 15-footer (4.5-meters) for
birdie at 14 to expand his lead to three shots.
	   ``When crunch time came, I hit the shots I had to hit and made
the putts I needed to make and that's what it takes to win a golf
tournament,'' the 26-year-old Floridian said.
	   Duval, ranked 160th on the tour in sand saves, blasted out close
enough for easy par putts three times in the final round.
	   ``I'm not going to play a perfect game of golf _ never have,
never will,'' he said. ``If you realize that and if you realize
that you're going to play poorly in spots, you maximize the good
shots and minimize the bad shots.''
	   Meanwhile, everyone else within reach was just muddling through.
	   Tiger Woods began the day four shots back but never seriously
threatened, falling by the wayside with bogeys at 14 and 15 on the
way to an even-par 70 and 5-under 275.
	   Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara drew as close as
two shots but his hopes drowned at the 16th when he hit his sand
wedge approach into the pond in front of the green and took a
double-bogey. His 72 left him at 4-under 276.
	   Mickelson was the only player to keep Duval within range. While
shooting a 68 that left him alone in second at 271, he almost cut
the gap to a shot on the final hole when his bladed sand wedge from
the fringe stopped on the lip and he had to settle for par.
	   Davis Love III had the lowest round of the day, a 65, to get to
272 for sole possession of third place.
	   This was the final year for the World Series name and the
current format, which has remained relatively unchanged since 1976.
Next year, the tournament will be known as the NEC Invitational,
part of the four-event World Golf Championship. The field will be
composed primarily of players from the sport's all-star teams _ the
Ryder and Presidents Cup squads _ along with additional qualifiers.

USC 27, Purdue 17
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN PETERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Freshman quarterback Carson Palmer came off
the bench to guide Southern California to two second-half
touchdowns and a field goal for a 27-17 victory over Purdue in Paul
Hackett's Trojan coaching debut.
	   On a sweltering afternoon in the Coliseum, Chad Morton scored on
a 98-yard kickoff return early in the game, then sealed the victory
with a 13-yard touchdown run with 3:02 left in the season-opening
Pigskin Classic matchup Sunday.
	   Temperatures on the Coliseum field reached 110-plus (43 C)
degrees and several USC band members, a cheerleader and a number of
fans fainted from the heat. The crowd of 56,623 also thinned out
considerably as the game wore on, with about a third of the fans
remaining in their seats by the middle of the final quarter.
	   Palmer, who replaced starter Mike Van Raaphorst with the Trojans
trailing 17-10 early in the third quarter, needed just two series
to help put his team ahead as USC outscored Purdue 17-0 in the
second half.
	   Palmer came in with the Trojans at their own 32-yard line, and,
after overthrowing the receiver on his first college attempt, threw
a 9-yard completion. Then Palmer hooked up with Larry Parker for a
42-yarder, down to the Purdue 8.
	   Shortly afterward, Petros Papadakis punched into the end zone
from the 1-yard line to tie the game with 1:57 left in the quarter.
	   The Trojans went ahead for the first time on Adam Abrams'
45-yard field goal in the opening minute of the fourth quarter. The
score was set up by linebacker Chris Claiborne's interception at
the Purdue 31.
	   With USC up by three, Van Raaphorst returned to replace Palmer
for the next series, then Palmer came back with 3:54 left in the
game and took the Trojans on a drive that ended with Morton's
second touchdown of the day, set up by David Gibson's fumble
recovery at the Purdue 44.
	   For the game, Palmer was 3-of-6 for 79 yards. Van Raaphorst, a
sophomore who started two games before being hurt last season,was
11-of-22 for 89 yards, with one interception.
	   Drew Brees, a sophomore in his first start for Purdue, completed
30-of-52 for 248 yards and two TDs, with two interceptions. He was
the dominant player in the first half, completing 18-of-27 for 148
yards and two scores.
	   The fourth football meeting ever between the schools, and the
first since 1976, marked a successful homecoming for Hackett, a USC
assistant under John Robinson in the late 1970s. After serving as
the Kansas City Chiefs' offensive coordinator, Hackett was hired as
by the Trojans last winter after Robinson was fired following a 6-5
season.
	   Purdue, which turned around last season under new coach Joe
Tiller, was coming off a 9-3 season and the school's first bowl
appearance since 1984.

 &UR; Chicago Cubs 4, Colorado Rockies 3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Sammy Sosa hit his 54th homer to tie Mark McGwire
for the major league lead and Kevin Tapani pitched seven strong
innings as the Chicago Cubs beat the Colorado Rockies 4-3 Sunday.
	   Sosa remained ahead of Roger Maris' record 61-homer pace,
putting the Cubs ahead 2-0 in the first with a towering, 482-foot
(147-meter) homer off the Coca-Cola sign next to the scoreboard in
left field.
	   The two-run shot off Darryl Kile (10-15) was the longest homer
at Coors Field this season and the fifth-longest in ballpark
history.
	   Jose Hernandez and Gary Gaetti also homered for the Cubs, who
won three out of four in the series.
	   Tapani (16-7) equaled his career high for wins in a season,
holding the Rockies to six hits and one run in seven innings. Rod
Beck put the tying run on second in the ninth before getting two
outs for his 39th save.
 &UR; Houston Astros 11, Pittsburgh Pirates 4
	   At Houston, Rookie Richard Hidalgo homered twice and the Houston
Astros got their 40th come-from-behind victory this season.
	   Houston, which trailed 3-0 in the first inning, has won three
straight games and 18 of 23.
	   Shane Reynolds (17-8) struck out a season-high 11 in seven
innings. He allowed four runs and six hits in winning for the fifth
time in his last six starts.
	   Jeff Bagwell hit two doubles and his 28th homer, a two-run shot
in the eighth for Houston. Houston had six doubles and three home
runs among its 14 hits. Turner Ward hit a three-run homer in the
first for the Pirates.
 &UR; Cincinnati Reds 14, Florida Marlins 7
	   At Cincinnati, the Cincinnati Reds finished a perfect season
against the Florida Marlins _ winning all nine games _ by coming
from behind three times.
	   Bret Boone hit his fourth homer in four games, drove in four
runs and extended his hitting streak to a career-high 13 games as
the Reds completed a four-game sweep of the defending World Series
champions.
	   It's the first time this century that the Reds have gone
undefeated against another National League team in a season series.
It's nothing new for the Marlins, who have been swept by three
National League teams this year alone.
 &UR; Expos 2, Padres 1 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Rookie Mike Thurman and three relievers held San
Diego to three hits and former Padre Scott Livingstone had a
pinch-hit RBI single in the seventh inning to give Montreal the
victory.
	   The Expos handed Kevin Brown (17-5) just his second loss in his
last 16 decisions. Brown was trying to become the Padres' first
18-game winner since Andy Hawkins in 1985.
	   After losing 12-8 Friday night in the opener of the four-game
series, the Expos have won two straight from the NL West-leading
Padres.
 &UR; Phillies 5, Giants 4 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Curt Schilling pitched his major
league-leading 13th complete game and the Philadelphia Phillies
turned a triple play to beat the San Francisco Giants.
	   Schilling (13-12) allowed seven hits, including two homers by
Barry Bonds, walked two and struck out five to boost his NL-leading
strikeout total to 258.
	   The Giants had the tying run on second with two outs in the
ninth, but Schilling retired pinch hitter J.T. Snow on a groundout
to end the game.
	   Schilling escaped another jam in the eighth with the benefit of
the Phillies' first triple play since Sept. 20, 1992, against
Pittsburgh.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen early
Monday amid profit-taking triggered by uncertainty about the
outlook for stability in Russia and on Wall Street. Japanese stock
prices were mixed.
	   The dollar bought 141.40 yen in early trading, down 1.92 yen
from late in Tokyo on Friday and also below its level of 141.85 in
late New York trading Friday.
	   Dealers cashed in dollar holdings on lingering concern about the
drop on Wall Street last week and the dim outlook for political
stability in Russia, traders said.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its slide Friday,
falling 114.31 points to 8051.68. In Russia, a compromise deal
between key parliamentary leaders and President Boris Yeltsin fell
apart late Sunday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average continued its fall to 12-year lows. The Nikkei lost
25.12 points, or 0.18 percent, to 13,890.51 in the first half hour
of trading on Monday.
	   On Friday, the index lost 498.16 points, or 3.46 percent, to
13,915.63 _ its lowest finish since March 6, 1986.
	   But the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on
the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 1.85 points, or
0.17 percent, to 1,088.84. It had fallen 29.98 points, or 2.68
percent, to close at 1,086.99 Friday.
	   Led higher by banking shares, the TOPIX rebounded following a
Nihon Keizai newspaper report Monday that Toyota Motor Corp. and
other Mitsui group firms may provide Sakura Bank Ltd. with a
massive infusion of new capital.
	   ``The report about Sakura Bank and the yen's rebound are seen as
bullish for major bank shares,'' said Yasuo Ueki, a general manager
at Nikko Securities Co.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond declined to 1.055 percent from Friday's finish of
1.070 percent, driving its price up to 112.75 yen from 112.65 yen.

Australian leader campaigning on economic track record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard opened his
re-election campaign Monday by stressing his government's economic
achievements in the midst of international upheaval.
	   ``We have a plan, we have a good track record, we are saying to
the Australian people, `At a time of international economic
turmoil, more than at any other time, you shouldn't be changing
economic managers,''' Howard told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio one day after calling an early election for Oct. 3.
	   Australia has one of the few economies in the Asia-Pacific
region that is not in recession, although its commodity-export
based economy is increasingly vulnerable to the global downturn as
orders for raw materials are cut back.
	   ``We are not heading for a recession,'' he said.
	   Howard said the lesson from overseas was that Japan was weaker
because it postponed reform of its banking system, underlining that
Australia's best protection against world economic chaos is to get
its own house in order.
	   Howard's governing conservatives want to introduce a 10 percent
goods and services tax, but are sweetening that proposal by cutting
personal income taxes and many sales taxes.
	   The opposition Labor Party, led by Kim Beazley, has proposed
more limited tax reforms and offered tax cuts aimed mainly at its
traditional blue-collar working class constituency.
	   The Labor Party would not introduce a goods and services tax,
however. Labor won a landslide victory in the 1993 election by
campaigning against the introduction of such a tax.
	   Howard attacked Beazley's tax package, saying it distinguished
between people in the work force and retirees living on their
savings.
	   Beazley said Labor's tax cuts, aimed at people on low and middle
incomes, would help the domestic economy amid international
difficulties.
	   ``Given that we are going to have in the next couple of years
major plummeting of consumer confidence _ that always happens when
there's a threat to jobs _ the focusing of the tax package on the
folk in our community who spend every single dollar that they earn,
then that's going to be not bad for the economy, as well as not bad
for themselves,'' Beazley said.
	   Labor has been ahead in opinion polls for most of the year. But
Howard's government has gained ground since it released its plan to
overhaul the nation's tax system earlier this month.
	   Under the constitution, Howard's government, elected in 1996,
had until next May to call an election.
	   But the economic effects of the Asian crisis are beginning to
filter into Australia, harming commodity exports and tourism. The
sooner Howard called the election, the better to avoid the
worsening effects of the regional problem.
	   In the current House of Representatives, Howard's governing
Liberal Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the
Labor Party holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's
Country Liberal Party, 1.
	   The Labor Party has the daunting task of winning 27 seats to
return to government, which is formed out of the House of
Representatives.
	   Half of the 76-member Senate will also be up for grabs.
	   There are about 11.7 million voters among Australia's 18 million
people.

<TEXT>
	   It is hard to dig in the Middle East, the cradle of
civilization, without stumbling over some artifact from an ancient
culture.
	   Ruins and other remnants from the far past offer archaeologists
insights into ways of life. The most spectacular relics are big
tourist draws, while other sites stand almost forgotten. And some
long-abandoned spots are taking on a surprising new life.
	   Associated Press correspondents report on three of those ancient
sites:
	   _Land-poor Syrians are moving back into the ``Dead Cities,'' a
string of Byzantine villages abandoned more than 1,000 years ago,
and archaeologists fear a priceless historical record is going to
be lost.
	   _The study of tablets recovered from the ruins of Ugarit in what
is now Syria is shining a new light on the Canaanites, whose
religion was reviled by the prophets of the Old Testament.
	   _In Iraq, the once powerful city of Ur, the purported birthplace
of the Jewish prophet Abraham, is visited by only the occasional
tourist and seems virtually neglected by the government.

Sakura Bank shares suspended on capital increase report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with trading suspended; UPDATES bank stocks rising in
last graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange temporarily suspended
trading in shares of Sakura Bank Ltd. on Monday following a
newspaper report that the major commercial bank was considering an
emergency capital increase.
	   The Nihon Keizai, Japan's leading business daily, reported
Monday that Sakura was considering a capital boost of around 300
billion yen (dlrs 2.1 billion) with the help of Toyota Motor Corp.,
Mitsui and Co., Mitsui Fudosan Co. and some 10 other companies in
the Mitsui group.
	   Sakura is the group's main bank.
	   A Sakura Bank spokesman was unable to immediately confirm the
report. But he said: ``We are moving toward such a direction, and
hope to make some kind of announcement as soon as possible today
(Monday).''
	   The bank scheduled a press conference for 11 a.m. (0200 GMT).
	   In the front-page article, the newspaper said the move could be
just the first of many private sector efforts to forestall a crisis
in Japan's financial system.
	   The move comes as a government plan for a taxpayer-financed
bailout of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. has
been criticized by opposition parties.
	   It is also designed to strengthen the bank amid Japan's `big
bang' deregulation of its financial industry and to make it easier
for Sakura to tie-up with a foreign partner or enter new fields of
business, the report said.
	   The report boosted bank shares higher, driving the benchmark
Nikkei 225 stock average moderately higher in early trading Monday.

Immigration debate simmers along below surface of campaign

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ While tax reform and economic policy
appear certain to dominate Australia's election campaign, the
immigration debate continues to simmer below the surface.
	   Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock has faced an uphill battle
during his term to make an impact in the face of the right-wing
populist One Nation party onslaught.
	   Ruddock predicted in July that immigration was likely to be a
minor election issue.
	   ``It's always difficult to judge these matters, but if you use
some of the polling that looks at particular political issues, it's
still on the bottom of the list,'' he said.
	   ``But obviously amongst some people in the Australian community
there is a concern about the levels of immigration, about the way
in which the program has been conducted.''
	   In the face of One Nation's strident anti-Asian immigration
stance and call for a zero net intake of all immigrants, Ruddock
has stayed a steady course of hitting back with a facts campaign.
	   The rise of One Nation has shown all too clearly that much of
middle Australia remains unconvinced that the populate or perish
maxim still applies as the nation heads toward a new century.
	   The problem he has faced is that when confronted with the facts,
obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, One Nation
leader Pauline Hanson and her immigration spokeswoman Robyn Spencer
have dismissed them as lies.
	   At the launch of One Nation's immigration policy, Spencer
claimed the government was lying about immigration figures being
set at 80,000, saying the figure was closer to 160,000.
	   But Ruddock has fought on, making sometimes controversial
structural changes to the immigration program, including forcing
migrants to wait two years before they can receive welfare.
	   The program had been reduced from an intake of 83,000 when the
conservative coalition came to power in 1996 to 74,000 and would
fall to 68,000 in 1998-99, he said.
	   As for Labor, opposition leader Kim Beazley this month declared
himself in favor of increased immigration in a move designed to
paint a clear differentiation between his party and One Nation.
	   But he gave no firm commitment to increase immigration levels,
saying the current intake was about right for the moment.
	   He promised to develop a policy based on Labor's belief that
immigration can help counter the impact of sluggish growth and an
aging population.

Sinn gets first LPGA victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Illinois (AP) _ Pearl Sinn had a 7-under-par 65
Sunday to beat Michelle Redman by a stroke and win the dlrs 700,000
Rail Classic for her first LPGA tour victory.
	   Sinn birdied the last two holes after Redman opened the door by
pulling her second shot into the water and bogeying the par-5 15th.
	   Redman got within a stroke of Sinn with a birdie from long range
on 16, but her 25-foot (7.6-meter) putt to tie from the back fringe
on 18 slid by the right side of the hole.
	   ``It was very sweet,'' said Korean-born Sinn, 31, who finished
with a 16-under 200 total to take the first prize of dlrs 105,000.
``It's been a long time coming.''
	   Redman, one of five players tied for first heading into the
final round at the 6,403-yard (5,850-meter) Rail Golf Course,
closed with a 68. Another shot back was Tammie Green, who led or
shared the lead most of the final round before a three-putt bogey
on the par-3 16th. She had a final-round 69.
	   First-round leader Dottie Pepper closed with a 68 to head a
group of six at 203. Pepper failed to overtake another Korean
player, rookie sensation Se Ri Pak, in the final event for the dlrs
250,000 Mercury LPGA Series bonus pool.
	   Pak, who finished in an eight-way tie for 10th after a
final-round 66, won the dlrs 100,000 first-place check for the
Mercury series, which was based on performances in seven televised
LPGA events.
	   At the close of the tournament, U.S. Solheim Cup captain Judy
Rankin named Rosie Jones and Sherri Steinhauer as her optional
picks for the 12-player squad that will face a team of Europeans in
matches at Muirfield Village in Ohio, Sept. 18-20.
	   Ten players, led by Kelly Robbins and Donna Andrews,
automatically made the team based on points earned over the past
two seasons.
	   Sinn got started early Sunday, making birdies on two of the five
holes she had to complete from the second round, which was
suspended by darkness Saturday night. Two hours later, she opened
the final round with a birdie to go 10 under and birdied the par-4
6th to shoot a 34 on the front nine.
	   The former Arizona State standout worked her way to the top of a
crowded leaderboard with birdies on Nos. 10, 12 and 13. Her last
two putts fell from distances of 21 feet (6.4 meters) on No. 17 and
25 feet on No. 18.
	   Sinn's best previous LPGA finish was a second in 1995. She won
the U.S. Amateur and the Public Links Championship in 1988.

	   UR, Iraq (AP) _ Ur is believed to be the birthplace of Abraham,
the biblical prophet revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims, and
it is a testament to the glories of ancient Mesopotamian culture.
	   Yet its ruins sit on an unmarked road virtually forgotten,
visited only occasionally by intrepid tourists.
	   Pope John Paul II has expressed interest in visiting Ur along
with such other biblical sites as Bethlehem, Nazareth and Mount
Sinai, ideally in 2000 when the Roman Catholic Church marks the
start of its third millennium.
	   There is little to be seen in Ur apart from its impressive
ziggurat, or temple.
	   For those interested in Abraham, the government-appointed
custodian, Dhaif Muhsen Naees, leads the way to a heap of mud
bricks and rubble mixed with sea pebbles and shells. ``This is the
house ... claimed to have belonged to the prophet Abraham,'' he
says.
	   In antiquity, Ur was the capital of Sumer and an important
commercial center in Mesopotamia, the fertile land that stretched
between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers.
	   The city reached its zenith at the close of the third millennium
B.C. under Ur-Nammu. The king sponsored arts and literature,
promulgated man's most ancient collection of laws and revived
agriculture.
	   But his name is most associated with the ziggurats, or stepped
towers, that he erected in several cities. They were similar to the
pyramids of Egypt, but had no tombs or chambers.
	   His massive, 26-meter-high (86-foot-high) ziggurat in Ur with
its three flights of 122 steps each is among the best preserved.
	   Ur's prosperity did not last long after Ur-Nammu's death. The
city fell to marauding tribes from Ilam in present-day Iran in 2004
B.C. and was abandoned.
	   Its monuments remained under a blanket of dust and earth until
1922, when an expedition led by British archaeologist Leonard
Woolley began uncovering its splendors.
	   Woolley's excavations, which lasted 12 years, unearthed royal
tombs along with their gold cups, weapons and statuettes, princely
headdresses and a dazzling Sumerian harp made of solid gold. The
artifacts belonged to Ur-Nammu and his queen as well as courtiers,
musicians and servants who were buried with them after willingly
swallowing poison.
	   The expedition was partly financed by Christian missionaries,
and Woolley wanted to prove Abraham had really lived in Ur, said
Dony Youkhanna, assistant head of Iraq's Antiquities Department.
	   In a residential quarter, Woolley came across a clay tablet
inscribed with the name ``Abram'' _ a chance discovery that caused
a sensation at the time.
	   Almost all foreign tourists, who Naees, the caretaker, says
number about 30 a month, come to see the house in which Abraham is
said to have been born.
	   But not all are convinced.
	   ``This is not enough proof. Abram was a common name in the
context of the Near East in those days,'' said Behnam Abu al-Soof,
Iraq's leading archaeologist.
	   Ur itself seems ignored.
	   In Nasiriya, the nearest Iraqi city to the ruins, which are 375
kilometers (230 miles) south of Baghdad, no sign points to Ur, the
ziggurat, the tombs or the traditional home of Abraham.
	   The ancient city, measuring three kilometers by five kilometers
(two miles by three miles), is surrounded by military
installations, including one of Iraq's main air bases. For security
reasons, always a concern in Iraq, it is sometimes not possible to
climb to the top of the ziggurat or take photographs.

<TEXT>
	   RAS SHAMRA, Syria (AP) _ To the prophets of the Old Testament,
the Canaanite god Baal was a symbol of decadence and his popularity
such a threat that Elijah took 450 priests of Baal ``to the brook
... and slew them there.''
	   Now, a new image of the Canaanite religion is emerging as
archaeologists decipher thousands of texts left behind in the
ancient city of Ugarit, where Baal was the patron god.
	   The texts reveal a wealthy and sophisticated Canaanite society
that imported alabaster from Egypt and timber from Anatolia and
whose religious services and hymns strikingly resembled those of
the ancient Israelites.
	   ``It's almost a revolutionary site,'' Neal H. Walls of Emory
University said in a telephone interview. ``It gives us the
Canaanite perspective on Canaanite culture. Previously, the only
perspective was the biblical one.''
	   Scholars say that by piecing together the Canaanite traditions
they can better understand the society that existed at the time of
the ancient Israelites and roughly encompassed modern-day Israel
with strong cultural influences as far north as Syria.
	   ``Ugarit has transformed our knowledge of the early Hebrew
Bible,'' said Nicholas Wyatt of the University of Edinburgh.
``Here, suddenly, we find people speaking a very similar language
and writing their poetry in part in almost an identical fashion.''
	   At its height from 1400 B.C. to 1200 B.C., Ugarit was a coastal
city in what is now northern Syria that grew rich trading with the
two major empires of the time, Pharaonic Egypt and the Hittite
Empire based in Anatolia.
	   Scribes kept careful records on clay tablets, writing in eight
languages, including Akkadian, the diplomatic language of the time,
and the local language, Ugaritic, which used one of the world's
first alphabets. The texts range from hymns and myths to orders for
lumber to the proper medical care for horses.
	   The site was first discovered in 1928. The latest cache of 57
tablets was uncovered in 1996 and is still being translated.
	   The texts are widely believed by archaeologists to predate the
biblical settlement of Canaan, which archaeologists say began about
the time of Ugarit's destruction in 1185 B.C.
	   ``Israel emerges out of the culture that we see most vividly
from Ugarit,'' said Wayne Pitard of the University of Illinois at
Urbana.
	   Some of the attributes used to describe the gods of Ugarit are
also found in the Old Testament, scholars say.
	   They point to Psalm 29, in which ``the Lord is upon the waters;
the God of glory thundereth.''
	   In the Canaanite pantheon worshipped in Ugarit, it is the voice
of Baal, the weather god, that thundered and it was Baal who
battled Yam, god of the seas. In biblical and modern Hebrew, yam is
the word for sea.
	   Scholars also note that in Ugarit, El was the patriarch of the
gods. In the Old Testament, ``el'' is used as a word for god and is
found in names like Daniel (``God is my judge'') and Ezekiel (``God
is strong'').
	   ``Many of the deities that appear in the Ugaritic pantheon
appear in the Hebrew Bible as acceptable names for God or as
deities against whom the prophets rail,'' said Dennis Pardee, who
is working in Damascus and at the University of Chicago to
translate the Ugaritic texts.
	   In Ugarit, the worship of Baal was led by the king, who would
climb the 20-meter (60-foot) tower on a hill overlooking the city
and offer sacrifices of sheep, bulls, birds and grain to appease
the lord of thunder.
	   The names of the sacrifices such as the ``peace offering'' _ the
sacrifice of an unblemished animal to give thanks to the lord _
were similar in ancient Israel and Ugarit.
	   ``The Hebrew Bible implies that the worship of the Canaanite
gods includes some type of cultic sex,'' Walls said, but there is
no clear evidence of this in Ugarit.
	   Most of Ugarit's 1,500 houses had two stories with four to six
rooms for the family and a terrace on the top. The stone palace in
the front section of the city had its own swimming pool and garden
and is believed to have been three or four stories tall.
	   ``These people were sophisticated. ... They weren't crude
peasants,'' Wyatt said.
	   The city was burned by conquerors from the sea and was never
rebuilt.
	   Its gods, however, were never forgotten. The Israelites
occasionally turned to worship Baal and other Canaanite deities
such as the goddess Ashtaroth, inspiring the wrath of their
prophets.
	   ``And they forsook the Lord and served Baal and Ashtaroth. And
the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered them
into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into
the hands of their enemies ....'' (Judges 2:13-14)

Panama rejects presidential re-election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES results of 82 percent of voters from 64 percent of
polling stations. ADDS president's concession and comments.

	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Dealing a setback to Panama's ruling party,
voters have rejected a proposed constitutional change that would
have allowed President Ernesto Perez Balladares to seek
re-election.
	   The president praised the results as proof of Panama's growing
strength as a democracy and said he would proudly hand power to his
successor next year.
	   ``We accept it humbly and with great pleasure,'' Perez
Balladares said Sunday night with his wife, Dora, at his side.
	   With 82.6 percent of votes counted, the anti-reform side had
63.7 percent of Sunday's vote compared to 34.5 for reform
supporters _ or 595,960 votes to 322,935.
	   More than 1.7 million Panamanians were eligible to vote. The
`No' side won in nearly every district.
	   Reform opponents had asserted Perez Balladares was trying to
hold power to put friends of his Democratic Revolutionary Party in
the best position to profit from the Dec. 31, 1999, handover of the
Panama Canal.
	   Reform opponents drove through the capital's streets Sunday
night honking their horns and waving `No' flags in celebration.
	   The president's backers had argued the change would help Panama
ensure political stability when the country takes control of the
canal and land being vacated by the U.S. military.
	   Panama's constitution restricts the president to one five-year
term, and re-election is only possible if a leader sits out two
terms. The next president will be elected in May and take office in
September.
	   With Perez Balladares out of the race, the ruling party's
nomination was up for grabs. Mireya Moscoso of the Arnulfista Party
is the leading opposition candidate.
	   A celebrating Moscoso said Panama had given ``a resounding `No'
to the personal aspirations of the president, who wanted to
perpetuate his stay in power.''
	   ``The people want change,'' she said.
	   Many Panamanians say Perez Balladares _ a millionaire economist
who won office with just 33 percent of the vote in 1994 _ has not
done enough to help poor Panamanians.
	   More than 40 percent of Panama's 2.6 million people live below
the poverty level of dlrs 228 a month for a family of five.
	   Backed by the business community, the pro-reform side spent
millions of dollars on television and radio commercials and ``Si''
(Yes) flags, T-shirts and banners. A huge street party Friday night
drew tens of thousands of Panamanians.
	   But Rosa de Olive, who voted at a Panama City primary school
where the president also cast his ballot, was confident the
proposed reform would lose.
	   ``Propaganda always does damage,'' she said.
	   The loss could prove embarrassing to Perez Balladares at a key
moment: On Saturday he will preside over a summit of more than a
dozen Latin American presidents.
	   Opponents said the pro-reform campaign had expected easy
victory, following the success of similar measures in Peru and
Argentina.
	   But they had urged Panama not to follow Peru, where Congress'
decision to allow President Alberto Fujimori to seek a third term
set off violent protests last week.
	   Democracy took hold in Panama just nine years ago, after U.S.
forces toppled the regime of Gen. Manuel Noriega, and the system of
checks-and-balances is not yet strong enough to prevent autocracy,
they said.

Rankin adds Steinhauer, Jones to U.S. team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Sherri Steinhauer beat the best of Europe in the toughest
conditions to win the Women's British Open. Judy Rankin figured she
would stack up just fine for the United States in the Solheim Cup
matches.
	   Rankin used her two captain's choices Sunday on Rosie Jones and
Steinhauer, who finished 11th and 12th in the Solheim Cup
standings. Rankin said that was not nearly as important as their
experience.
	   Jones, who needed to win the State Farm Rail Classic this
weekend to earn a spot on the team but instead missed the cut, has
a 4-2-0 record in the 1990 and 1996 Solheim Cup matches, both U.S.
victories.
	   ``Rosie is as good a match player as I know, and I very much
wanted her with us,'' Rankin said. ``She just has that knack for
match play.''
	   The surprise was Steinhauer, a 35-year-old from Wisconsin. She
started the season 23rd in the Solheim standings and with only two
victories in 11 years on the LPGA tour _ the 1992 du Maurier
Classic and the 1994 Sprint Championship.
	   But she rose steadily throughout the year and made a huge leap
by winning the British Open last month at Royal Lytham and St.
Annes.
	   ``She won on a very difficult course in very difficult
conditions, playing all those players we're going to face next
month,'' Rankin said.
	   All that did was make Rankin look harder at Steinhauer, and she
feels she came up with a winner.
	   Steinhauer was also 12th on the money list, the highest of any
American who wasn't already on the team. She also ranked fifth in
birdies and sixth in greens in regulation, two important statistics
for match play.
	   ``When you look at my list from 11 to 20, she is the player who
stepped forward and has done something,'' Rankin said. ``When I
looked in depth at some of the things she was accomplishing, she
deserved her shot. She earned points in seven events this year,
which I couldn't get other players to do.''
	   Two of those other players were Michelle McGann and Nancy Lopez.
Both were in good position to make the team until going into a deep
slump this summer. They finished 14 and 15th in points.
	   The long-hitting McGann showed signs of turning her game around
in the past month, but not enough to take Rankin's eyes off
Steinhauer. Lopez was betrayed by back problems and a balky putter
in recent months.
	   ``I had second thoughts about Nancy,'' Rankin said. ``She's one
of the best to ever play the game, but I couldn't justify it. I
know if Nancy were on the team, she would rise to the occasion. But
being a former player, I feel a responsibility to fairness. In the
end, I felt Sherri Steinhauer was supposed to get this shot.''
	   Steinhauer was 2-1 in her matches at the 1994 Solheim Cup. Her
lone loss was in a best-ball match with Patty Sheehan, and they
lost 1-up to Liselotte Neumann and Helen Alfredsson. Rankin called
Sheehan for advice, and the Hall of Famer assured her Steinhauer
was a worthy pick.
	   The captain's picks give Rankin a well-rounded team for the
matches, to be played Sept. 18-20 at Muirfield Village Golf Club in
Dublin, Ohio. She has only two rookies _ one of them 40-year-old
Chris Johnson _ and three players in their 20s _ Brandie Burton,
Kelly Robbins and Pat Hurst.
	   She also has a pregnant player _ Tammie Green, in her fifth
month but still playing solidly. Green finished third Sunday at the
State Farm Rail Classic to lock up her place as one of the 10
automatic qualifiers.
	   The others who qualified by finishing in the top 10 in the
standings were Donna Andrews, Meg Mallon, Dottie Petter, Juli
Inkster and Betsy King. Pepper and King have played in every
Solheim Cup, while Burton has played on every team since she turned
pro in 1991 at age 19.
	   ``I like my team,'' Rankin said. ``We'll see if wisdom and
experience can prevail.''
	   Although the Americans have a 3-1 advantage since the matches
began in 1990, they are considered slight underdogs because of the
powerful play of the Swedes _ which comprise half of the European
team.
	   Of the five players who have won multiple times on the LPGA tour
this year, three are from Sweden _ Annika Sorenstam, Neumann and
Alfredsson.

Saudi militant's wish: To die fighting America

<TEXT>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ President Bill Clinton says the United States
faces a terrorist war led by Muslim radical Osama bin Laden. Here,
in the words of friends and colleagues, is a profile of this new
target of American might, the man blamed for bombing U.S. embassies
in Africa.
	   ___
 &UR; By FAIZA SALEH AMBAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
militant being hunted by the United States, is waging holy war
against the superpower from rat-infested caves in Afghanistan,
armed with unwavering faith, bitter hatred and _ some say _ a death
wish.
	   But former colleagues say one thing bin Laden is not armed with
is hundreds of millions of dollars in inherited wealth. Such
reports are exaggerated, these sources say.
	   The Saudi exile's rage against America began when U.S. troops
landed on Saudi Arabia's holy Muslim soil in 1990 to oust Iraq from
Kuwait, say former friends and followers of the man blamed by
Washington for the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa.
	   ``I'm fighting so I can die a martyr and go to heaven to meet
God. Our fight now is against the Americans. I regret having lived
until now. I have nothing to lose,'' bin Laden was quoted as saying
by Abdul-Bari Atwan, Palestinian editor of the Arabic daily Al-Quds
Al-Arabi.
	   Atwan and others describe a soft-spoken, modest but charismatic
man, infused with the serenity of the deeply devout.
	   A half-dozen former friends, neighbors and colleagues
interviewed about bin Laden would talk only if their names were not
used, not wanting to publicize an association with a man who has
become persona non grata almost everywhere.
	   Beneath bin Laden's calm exterior, they said, lies a burning
desire to rid Saudi Arabia of all American influences, a goal that
challenges decades of close ties between the Saudi monarchy and
Washington.
	   ``Osama sees the world in very simplistic terms, as a struggle
between Muslims on one side, and on the other, Jews and Christians
bent on oppressing them,'' said a former confidant. ``He will not
rest until either the U.S. leaves Saudi Arabia, or he dies trying
to make it happen.''
	   During the 1990-91 Gulf conflict, bin Laden tried to dissuade
the Saudi government from allowing ``infidel'' armies into Saudi
Arabia, home of Islam's holiest sites.
	   A onetime neighbor says he presented a 10-page report to Prince
Sultan, the Saudi defense minister, describing how he and
colleagues could train Saudis to defend themselves and how
equipment from his family's large construction firm could be used
to dig trenches on the border with Iraq and lay sand traps against
potential invaders.
	   But the Saudi leadership turned to the United States to protect
its vast oil reserves. When he continued criticizing Riyadh's close
alliance with Washington, bin Laden was stripped of his citizenship
by the Saudi government, which feared his militant brand of Islam.
	   Before he fell from grace, bin Laden, 44, was a Saudi hero.
	   For a decade he had fought Soviet occupation forces in
Afghanistan as a leader of Arab militants allied with the Afghan
Mujaheddin. When he returned home, he was showered with praise and
donations, and was in demand as a speaker in mosques and homes.
Over 250,000 cassettes of his fiery speeches were distributed,
selling out as soon as they appeared.
	   In the now-banned tapes, bin Laden lashed out at U.S. foreign
policy and called for a boycott of American goods.
	   ``When we buy American goods, we are accomplices in the murder
of Palestinians,'' he says in one cassette. ``American companies
make millions in the Arab world with which they pay taxes to their
government. The United States uses that money to send dlrs 3
billion a year to Israel, which it uses to kill Palestinians.''
	   After his falling out with Saudi rulers, bin Laden traveled to
Africa, seeking refuge in Sudan. But the Sudanese expelled him
after they came under pressure from Saudi Arabia and the United
States, and he returned to Afghanistan.
	   Although his anti-Soviet crusade of the 1980s was backed by the
United States, he distrusted America even then, say former
followers.
	   ``We are in alliance with them now because we have common
interests, but they are the enemy of Islam,'' a Saudi comrade from
the Afghan days recalled his saying.
	   Back on familiar terrain in Afghanistan, the bearded, 6-foot-1
bin Laden prepared for a new holy war _ one that would turn him
into Washington's No. 1 public enemy.
	   Planning strategy in damp caves infested with scorpions and
rats, bin Laden maintained a disciplined lifestyle, waking up
before dawn for prayers, then eating a simple breakfast of cheese
and bread. He closely monitored world affairs, especially U.S.
foreign policy in the Arab world. Almost daily, he and his men _
Egyptians, Yemenis, Saudis, among others _ practiced attacks,
hurling explosives at targets and shooting at imaginary enemies.
	   Now he has emerged from the obscurity of the caves to dominate
the front pages of newspapers and nightly news across the world.
Former friends and journalists who know him say bin Laden enjoys
the attention.
	   ``Bin Laden loves publicity. He wants to pass a message to
Muslims all over the world and he needs the media to do it. He is
isolated from the outside world and living in a dangerous
environment. His only outlet is the media,'' says journalist Atwan.
	   Since last week's U.S. missile attacks on targets linked to bin
Laden in Afghanistan and Sudan, dozens of men apparently have tried
to enlist in his ranks. Opposition groups say they've received
calls from young Muslims asking how to get in touch with him.
	   Although press reports have said bin Laden funds his operations
through a vast international financial empire, former associates
say those claims are exaggerated.
	   Saudi Arabia froze his bank accounts and his dlrs 350 million
share of his family's multi-billion-dollar empire in 1992. He also
lost about dlrs 150 million in investments when he was forced to
leave Sudan in 1996.
	   Another blow came when a former key financial aide, Sayed Tayib
al-Madani, received a pardon from Saudi Arabia last year in return
for exposing some of bin Laden's financial operations.

<TEXT>
	   The Saudi renegade's path to militant Islam began as a teen-ager
in the 1970s, when he got caught up in the fundamentalist movement
then sweeping Saudi Arabia. He was a voracious reader of Islamic
literature and listened to weekly sermons in the holy city of
Mecca.
	   A relative remembers his teen-age passion for religion, evident,
for example, when he eloquently addressed a roomful of men at a
family funeral.
	   ``He was well-versed in religion and confident speaking in front
of all those people. And he was at most 19,'' said the in-law.
	   The only son of a Syrian mother, bin Laden was born in Saudi
Arabia's commercial capital, Jiddah, to a conservative family.
Among the 54 children fathered by Mohammed bin Laden, a contracting
magnate, Osama quickly developed a reputation as the most pious.
	   Unlike many of his brothers, bin Laden chose to stay in the
kingdom for his education, preferring a more Islamic environment.
He graduated in civil engineering from Jiddah's King Abdul-Aziz
University.
	   He married in his early 20s and, despite his vast wealth, chose
to live in modest apartments with his wives, says a former neighbor
who spoke on condition of anonymity. Today his three wives _ a
Syrian and two Saudis _ and their 15 or so children live in cities
near his bases in Afghanistan.
	   Throughout his career, bin Laden has led a spartan life. In
Sudan he refused the comfort of air conditioning even in the
blistering summer heat.
	   ``I don't want to get used to the easy life,'' Saudi journalist
Jamal Khashoggi quoted him as saying.
	   On the Afghan battlefield, he gained a reputation for being a
courageous and resourceful commander.
	   One battle stands out. In 1987, he and his men faced
near-impossible odds in the southern province of Paktia. Despite
being outnumbered and poorly armed, they defeated the Soviet units.
He still proudly shows off an assault rifle said to have been taken
from a dead Russian general after that battle, an AK-47 he can be
seen toting in television interviews.
	   ``He became even more fearless after Paktia,'' said a former
friend. And like others who know bin Laden, this source said he now
expects him to fight until the end, ``and die in glory.''

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Investigators sifted through the charred
remains of a Cuban airliner that plowed into a soccer field,
recovering the black box Sunday and searching for other clues to
the disaster that killed 79 people, including five children playing
on the ground.
	   The Tupolev-154 aircraft owned by Cubana de Aviacion burst into
flames Saturday during takeoff, clipping through two homes and an
auto mechanic's shop before slamming into the field 200 yards (182
meters) from a runway at Quito's Mariscal Sucre International
Airport.
	   The plane, en route first to the coastal city of Guayaquil
before continuing on to Havana, was carrying 76 passengers and 14
crew members, said Gen. Osvaldo Dominguez, director of the Civil
Aviation Office. At least 21 passengers reportedly survived the
crash.
	   Rescue workers found another charred body Sunday, bringing the
death toll to 79. At least 10 people on the ground were killed.
	   Survivors and relatives of the dead on Sunday criticized the
plane's crew and Ecuadorean civil aeronautics officials for
apparently allowing the plane to take off despite engine trouble.
	   ``How is it possible that they allowed a plane to take off after
the engine failed to start five times,'' said Jorge Crespo, whose
nephew was killed in the crash.
	   Survivors say Rodrigo Crespo approached the cabin crew and
demanded the plane not take off, but was turned away.
	   Dominguez said it appeared that one of the engines stalled
before the crash.
	   On Sunday, police cordoned off the crash site while
investigators searched for a missing local resident. It was not
immediately clear if the body found Sunday was that of the missing
neighbor.
	   Police found the plane's black box on Sunday and said it will be
taken to Cuba to help determine the cause of the crash.
	   Firefighters sprayed jets of water onto the smoldering ruins,
hoping to prevent further explosions. Though part of the fuselage
remained intact, the plane's nose and front section were destroyed.
	   The jet barely missed a busy street at the end of the airport
runway in a middle-class residential neighborhood high in the
Andes.
	   ``There was a great deal of noise, the plane started to shake,
we all went forward and the plane split in half,'' said Eduardo
Rivadeneira, 21, a crash survivor who was traveling with his aunt.
``I then saw ... people on fire and shouting madly. I managed to
get out of the plane before it burst into flames.''
	   ``My aunt did not make it.''
	   None of the crew members survived the crash. Two stewardesses
helped passengers escape from the burning plane, only to be
consumed by the fire, survivors told local newspapers.
	   Relatives of the Ecuadoreans who died in the crash began
identifying the remains of their loved ones at the morgue. Elvira
San Martin, mother of three of the children killed on the ground,
was taken there by her family. They supported her as she saw their
charred corpses and wept.
	   San Martin said her children were outside the family's tin-roof
shack, just before the plane ripped through the one-room dwelling.
She had not been home at the time.
	   ``My kids were playing,'' she said, ``and then I never saw them
again.''
	   The neighborhood of carpentry and mechanics shops has long been
plagued by the noise and constant possibility of accidents.
	   In 1984, an Ecuadorean cargo plane slammed into the neighborhood
beyond the end of the runway after failing to gain altitude,
killing 65 people.
	   And in 1996, a Brazilian FLY airlines plane carrying a Brazilian
soccer team crashed into airport walls after one of the jet
turbines flamed out and the crew aborted the takeoff. One player
was slightly injured.

<TEXT>
	   RIETI, Italy (AP) _ This tiny town tucked in the mountains
northeast of Rome has often provided a scenic setting for world
record performances on the track.
	   But with a diminished field because of the crowded international
schedule, and the star attraction, Noureddine Morceli, showing he's
on the downside of a once-dominant career, Sunday's Rieti Grand
Prix meet was relatively slow.
	   The highlights: two women bettered meet records that had stood
since 1988.
	   Russia's Maria Pantyukhova clocked 8:42.11 in the 3,000 to slash
over five seconds off Roberta Brunet's Rieti mark. But
Pantyukhova's time wasn't among the season's top 10.
	   Former world champion Maria Mutola of Mozambique won the 800
meters in 1:57.71, 0.35 seconds faster than Anna Fidelia Quirot's
old standard _ and 1.60 seconds slower than Mutola's season best.
	   Still, it was one of the better performances Sunday on a track
that has consistently proven conducive to swift runs.
	   Six world records have been set here, including Morceli's
still-standing mark for the mile in 1993 and a then-record 3:28:86
for the 1,500 the year before.
	   But Morceli has essentially ceded his title as the world's top
middle-distance runner to Hicham El Guerrouj, who set the current
1,500 record of 3:26 in Rome last month.
	   Morceli, 28, struggled to win the 1,500 in 3:33.58 Sunday and
then announced he would not race again this season. It wasn't until
the final 100 meters that the Algerian managed to put away
countryman Miloud Abaoub, who clocked 3:34.47.
	   ``I'm satisfied with winning. That's what's important to me
now,'' said Morceli, the Olympic champion and a three-time world
titlist who acknowledged his strength and speed have diminished
significantly. ``But this is my last race of the year. I need to
save energy for next season.''
	   He'll skip Tuesday's Golden League meet in Berlin and the Sept.
5 Grand Prix Final in Moscow.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Nigeria's Sean Ogunkoya easily won the men's
100 in 10.09 seconds. The 20-year-old, who timed 9.96 in beating a
good field at Zurich, Switzerland, Aug. 12, appears to be an
emerging star.
	   Other winners, all in relatively slow times, included Percival
Spencer in the 200, Michael McDonald in the 400, Mark Everett in
the 800, and Florian Schwarthoff, bronze medalist at the 1996
Olympics, in the 110 hurdles. Among the women, Chandra Sturrup won
the 100 and Natalya Voronova took the 200.

	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ The only thing the Belgian
Grand Prix didn't have was a fistfight. And even that came
perilously close.
	   Damon Hill's first win in two seasons was merely an afterthought
as the Grand Prix circus looked back upon some of the most horrific
crashes, including a 12-car pile up during the race, of the past
few years.
	   Once the rain settled after the chaotic and spectacular race,
the world title chase was still as open as ever, with Mika Hakkinen
holding a small edge over Michael Schumacher.
	   Belgium's trademark rain outperformed itself Sunday and the
results could have been disastrous.
	   The race was little more than ten seconds old when David
Coulthard lost control on the flooded track and over half of the 22
cars smashed into each other, with tires and metal flying through
the rain. About a dozen car wrecks littered an area of 150 meters
(492 feet) in front of the grandstand.
	   ``It was incredible,'' said Hill, who was one of the few to
escape without any damage.
	   The massive pileup added to Friday's scary 180 mph (290 kph)
crash of reigning world champion Jacques Villeneuve and the
high-speed shunt of Mika Salo on Saturday. Amazingly, no one got
injured, a tribute to the improved safety standards of the sport
after the death four years ago of Ayrton Senna.
	   Coulthard could have been injured in another way though.
	   Schumacher used his brilliant wet-weather skills and his
especially prepared Ferrari to dominate and was well on his way to
winning his fifth Belgian grand pushing Mika Hakkinen off the top
of the championship leaderboard.
	   Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes teammate Coulthard held off
Schumacher in an attempt not be lapped and when he finally slowed
down, Schumacher could not anticipate his action and slammed into
him.
	   He limped into the pits on three wheels and immediately went out
to look for Coulthard. ``You want to kill me?'' the German shouted
and had to be restrained before fists could fly.
	   The McLaren team denied Coulthard deliberately tried to get
Schumacher out of the race and said he slowed down to let the
German pass.
	   ``I didn't have any chance and banged into him,'' Schumacher
said afterwards. He clutched both hands to his head, considering he
could have easily become the world championship leader. He held a
half-minute lead at the time.
	   It allowed Hill, the 1996 world champion, to sneak back into the
lead and win his first Grand Prix in two seasons.
	   It also was the Jordan team's first-ever win. And on top of that
it came with a one-two performance, as Ralf Schumacher came in
close behind Hill.
	   ``It is a fantastic result,'' said Hill.
	   ``Monza also should favor us,'' he said.
	   The speed of Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes should also be telling
on the superfast circuit. Then again, it's also Ferrari's home
track and Schumacher already didn't appreciate how Coulthard
spoiled Italian team's 600th Grand Prix.

Dollar lower, Tokyo stocks higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late morning stock, bond and dollar rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen
Monday morning amid profit-taking triggered by uncertainty about
the outlook for stability in Russia and on Wall Street. Japanese
stock prices rose moderately.
	   The dollar bought 141.30 yen in morning trading, down 2.02 yen
from late in Tokyo on Friday and also below its level of 141.85 in
late New York trading Friday.
	   Dealers cashed in dollar holdings on lingering concern about the
drop on Wall Street last week and the dim outlook for political
stability in Russia, traders said.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its slide Friday,
falling 114.31 points to 8051.68. In Russia, a compromise deal
between key parliamentary leaders and President Boris Yeltsin fell
apart late Sunday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average recovered moderately from its fall to 12-year lows
Friday. The Nikkei gained 87.02 points, or 0.63 percent, to close
the morning session at 14,002.65 on Monday.
	   On Friday, the index lost 498.16 points, or 3.46 percent, to
13,915.63 _ its lowest finish since March 6, 1986.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange rose 9.97 points, or 0.92 percent, to
1,096.96. It had fallen 29.98 points, or 2.68 percent, to close at
1,086.99 Friday.
	   Stocks rebounded following a report that Sakura Bank Ltd. may
get a massive infusion of new capital from Toyota Motor Corp. and
other Mitsui group firms.
	   ``The report about Sakura Bank and the yen's rebound are seen as
bullish for major bank shares,'' said Yasuo Ueki, a general manager
at Nikko Securities Co.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond declined to 1.050 percent from Friday's finish of
1.070 percent, driving its price up to 112.79 yen from 112.65 yen.

Hank Kuehne beats veteran Tom McKnight to win U.S. Amateur

<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ Winning the U.S. Amateur golf
championship means less to Hank Kuehne than staying sober.
	   ``This is the second greatest victory in my life _ sobriety is
definitely No. 1,'' the 22-year-old Texan said Sunday after
overcoming one-time pro Tom McKnight of Galax, Virginia, by 2 and 1
in a dramatic match-play duel.
	   McKnight, 44, who runs a chain of 17 convenience stores and
gasoline stations in rural southwestern Virginia, stemmed an early
runaway in the 36-hole final but his heroics around the green
failed him down the straight at Oak Hill.
	   ``I really can't put it into words for anybody _ it's an
unbelievable feeling,'' said Kuehne, a recovering alcoholic from
McKinney, Texas, who is entering his senior year at Southern
Methodist University in Dallas.
	   He joked, ``I got to get back to school, I'm a week behind.''
	   The Kuehnes have been the most notable family in amateur golf of
late. Kuehne's elder brother and caddy, Trip, lost 2-down in the
1994 U.S. Amateur final to Tiger Woods; his sister, Kelli, won the
U.S. Women's Amateur in 1995 and 1996 before turning pro.
	   ``It tops off a long journey,'' Trip Kuehne said. ``Henry (Hank)
had won before he even got here.''
	   Hooked on alcohol in his teens, Kuehne survived a scary car
crash in Oklahoma in February 1995 when he ran a stop sign while
drunk. He survived with broken ribs, entered a clinic and has been
sober ever since.
	   ``I didn't want to live like that anymore,'' he said, calling
his family ``the pillar in my recovery, to say the least.''
	   McKnight joined the pro circuit out of college in 1976 but never
qualified for the PGA Tour and quit trying when he dislocated his
elbow playing basketball in 1980.
	   During his year-long recovery, he took on his father's business,
started a family _ he has three teen-age children _ and regained
his amateur status in 1984.
	   ``It's just been a real thrill to be here,'' McKnight said.
``This is as good as it gets and it's just hard to describe the
feelings that you have. Look at my family _ they're all sitting
there with eyes swelled up.''
	   To reach the final, McKnight knocked out Spanish sensation
Sergio Garcia, the 18-year-old British Amateur champion who had
toppled defending champion Matt Kuchar in Friday's quarterfinal.
	   Kuehne was 3-up after the morning round and might have been
further ahead but for some drama around the greens.
	   ``There were peaks and valleys all day,'' McKnight said. ``I
didn't play my best at times but I made up for it with great
saves.''
	   McKnight grabbed the lead on the 2nd hole when he sank a 35-foot
(10-meter) birdie putt and Kuehne missed from 3 feet (one meters).
He bogeyed the next two holes to fall 1-down, drew level with a par
on the 5th, then drove into a creek on the 7th and into the trees
on the 8th to drop 2-down.
	   Kuehne bolted further ahead on the 10th with a 15-foot (4-meter)
birdie putt. Although McKnight clawed back on the par-3 11th by
chipping in from a front bunker, Kuehne soared to 4-up with birdies
on Nos. 14 and 16.
	   McKnight holed a crucial 20-foot (6-meter) par putt to tie the
17th and closed the gap on the 18th when Kuehne's drive was hemmed
in by trees.
	   Momentum swung right around in the early afternoon. McKnight
dropped an 8-foot (2.4-meter) birdie putt on the 2nd, then drew
level when Kuehne got jammed in a fairway bunker on the 4th and
drove into a 5th-hole creek.
	   But after recovering the lead on the 6th, where he sank an
11-foot (3.3-meter) birdie putt, McKnight missed four short putts
from 5 feet on both the 8th and 10th, 2 feet (half a meter) on the
11th and 7 feet on the 12th to again fall 3-down.
	   He benefited from a Kuehne bogey on the 14th, then sank a
30-footer (9-meter) on the 15th to get back to 1-down. On the par-4
17th, however, with Kuehne safely on the green in two, he lipped a
20-foot (6-meter) par putt and conceded the match.

Panama rejects presidential re-election

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ In a setback to Panama's ruling party, voters
have rejected a proposed constitutional change that would have
allowed President Ernesto Perez Balladares to seek re-election.
	   The president praised the results as proof of Panama's growing
strength as a democracy and said he would proudly hand power to his
successor next year.
	   ``We accept it humbly and with great pleasure,'' Perez
Balladares said Sunday night with his wife, Dora, at his side.
	   With 92 percent of ballots counted, the anti-reform side had
63.8 percent of Sunday's vote compared to 34.2 for reform
supporters _ or 667,789 votes to 358,411.
	   More than 1.7 million Panamanians were eligible to vote. The
`No' side won in nearly every district.
	   Reform opponents had asserted Perez Balladares was trying to
hold power to put friends of his Democratic Revolutionary Party in
the best position to profit from the Dec. 31, 1999, handover of the
Panama Canal.
	   Reform opponents drove through the capital's streets Sunday
night honking their horns and waving `No' flags in celebration.
	   The president's backers had argued the change would help Panama
ensure political stability when the country takes control of the
canal and land being vacated by the U.S. military.
	   Panama's constitution restricts the president to one five-year
term, and re-election is only possible if a leader sits out two
terms. The next president will be elected in May and take office in
September.
	   With Perez Balladares out of the race, the ruling party's
nomination was up for grabs. Mireya Moscoso of the Arnulfista Party
is the leading opposition candidate.
	   A celebrating Moscoso said Panama had given ``a resounding `No'
to the personal aspirations of the president, who wanted to
perpetuate his stay in power.''
	   ``The people want change,'' she said.
	   Many Panamanians say Perez Balladares _ a millionaire economist
who won office with just 33 percent of the vote in 1994 _ has not
done enough to help poor Panamanians.
	   More than 40 percent of Panama's 2.6 million people live below
the poverty level of dlrs 228 a month for a family of five.
	   Backed by the business community, the pro-reform side spent
millions of dollars on television and radio commercials and ``Si''
(Yes) flags, T-shirts and banners. A huge street party Friday night
drew tens of thousands of Panamanians.
	   But Rosa de Olive, who voted at a Panama City primary school
where the president also cast his ballot, was confident the
proposed reform would lose.
	   ``Propaganda always does damage,'' she said.
	   The loss could embarrass to Perez Balladares at a key moment: On
Saturday he will preside over a summit of more than a dozen Latin
American presidents.
	   Opponents said the pro-reform campaign had expected easy
victory, following the success of similar measures in Peru and
Argentina.
	   But they had urged Panama not to follow Peru, where Congress'
decision to allow President Alberto Fujimori to seek a third term
set off violent protests last week.
	   Democracy took hold in Panama just nine years ago, after U.S.
forces toppled the regime of Gen. Manuel Noriega, and the system of
checks-and-balances is not yet strong enough to prevent autocracy,
they said.

DENVER: against Pittsburgh.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Cardinals 8, Braves 7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In St. Louis, Mark McGwire answered the challenge from Sammy
Sosa again.
	   Hours after Sosa connected for his 54th home run, McGwire hit
No. 55 to regain the major-league lead and lead the Cardinals.
	   For a little icing on the cake, McGwire's three-run, 501-foot
shot in the seventh inning off Dennis Martinez capped the
Cardinals' comeback from an early six-run deficit.
	   McGwire's homer came one day after he was ejected for arguing a
called third strike in the first inning. The ejection, his first
since joining the Cardinals last year, sparked a noisy game-long
demonstration from usually placid Busch Stadium fans.
	   McGwire, who is within one of tying Hack Wilson's NL record, has
26 games remaining to break Roger Maris' record of 61 homers in
1961. Fifteen of those games are at Busch Stadium, where he has hit
29 homers to obliterate the previous record of 17.
	   The Braves hit four homers, including two by Andres Galarraga.
Center fielder Ray Lankford robbed Atlanta of a fifth when he
leaped high above the wall to snare Tony Graffanino's bid for a
third homer in the second inning.
	   McGwire's first homer in four games came on 1-0 pitch from
Martinez (3-6) and disappeared over the backdrop beyond the
center-field wall. It was his fifth 500-foot-plus homer at Busch
this season and the crowd of 44,051 demanded _ and got _ a curtain
call.
	   McGwire has hit his last three homers on the same day Sosa has
homered.
	   Mark Petkovsek (7-4) allowed one hit in two scoreless innings.
Juan Acevedo pitched the ninth for his fourth save.
 &UR; Dodgers 4, Mets 2 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, backup catcher Tom Prince hit a tie-breaking
two-run double in the seventh inning and former Met Dave Mlicki
struck out a season-high nine.
	   New York's loss, coupled with Chicago's 4-3 win at Colorado,
left the Mets and Cubs tied for the NL wild-card lead.
	   Pitching in 101-degree heat with no breeze, Mlicki (8-6) went
the distance, giving up two runs on eight hits. He walked none and
retired the last 13 in a row.
	   The right-hander has beaten his former teammates twice since
being traded on June 4.
	   Masato Yoshii (5-8) took the loss, giving up four runs and seven
hits in six-plus innings.

Typhoon veers away from Japan's Pacific coast, damage toll mounts

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Typhoon Rex veered away from Japan's main island of
Honshu on Monday, but the record rainfall it spawned forced
thousands to flee their homes.
	   Flooding and landslides caused by the rains have killed 14
people and injured 45 others since Thursday, said National Police
Agency spokesman Keiichi Nakamura. Five people have been reported
missing, he said.
	   National broadcaster NHK reported the death total had risen to
16 people, but police were unable to confirm the figure.
	   Rex, swirling with winds of up to 126 kph (80 mph), was located
about 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of Tokyo in the Pacific
Ocean as of 9:55 a.m. Monday (0055 GMT), the Meteorological Agency
said.
	   It was headed away from heavily populated eastern Honshu, moving
northeast at a speed of 15 kilometers (9 miles) per hour, the
agency said.
	   Still, heavy rains it caused were forecast to pour down on much
of flooded northeastern Japan until at least early Tuesday.
	   Some 90,000 people have been instructed to evacuate their homes
in four prefectures, or states, near Tokyo, according to the
Yomiuri newspaper, Japan's largest daily.
	   Some areas were expected to receive up to 100 millimeters (4
inches) of additional rain on Monday.
	   The dead included a 73-year-old woman who was fatally injured
Sunday in a landslide caused by heavy rains in Fukushima
prefecture, 239 kilometers (148 miles) northeast of Tokyo, the
Asahi newspaper reported.
	   Casualties and damage have spread to at least 22 prefectures.
The National Police Agency said 116 residences have been partly or
totally destroyed and that 3,632 homes have been flooded.
	   Adding an air of urgency to flood damage control efforts, the
Japanese government decided Monday to convene a meeting of the
nation's Central Disaster Prevention Council, Kyodo News reported.
	   The flooding has also closed some roads and halted train
service. East Japan Railway Co. on Monday canceled its regular
Yamagata Shinkansen bullet trains for a third day, said company
spokesman Hiroshiku Ikeda.
	   Police said 951 roads and three railways have been damaged.
	   The rains topped television news broadcasts and were reported
with banner headlines in Monday morning newspapers.

<TEXT>
	   AKRON, Ohio (AP) _ Less than a year ago, there were some who
questioned whether David Duval could win on the PGA Tour.
	   Now he holds the season record for earnings and is arguably the
best young player in the world.
	   Over the last 11 months he has won six times and collected more
than dlrs 3.3 million, stashing dlrs 405,000 more into his wallet
Sunday by winning the NEC World Series of Golf.
	   ``I believe in what I do,'' Duval said after he kept all
challengers at arm's length with a 2-under-par 68 that left him at
11-under 269 and two shots ahead of 1996 World Series champion Phil
Mickelson. ``I always stayed true to the course I wanted to follow,
even when people questioned it and didn't think I could win.''
	   The World Series was his third win this year _ more than anyone
else on tour _ and his 1998 total of dlrs 2,070,283 just beat the
record of dlrs 2,066,833 set last year by Tiger Woods.
