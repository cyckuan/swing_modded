<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Government Accused for Filing False Case Against  Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party ( BNP) Wednesday accused the government of Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina of filing "false" case against its chief
Begum Khaleda Zia only to tarnish her image ahead of the national
election next year.
</P>
<P>
At a public rally here Wednesday, they said the BNP Chairperson
and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia was falsely implicated in a
graft case Tuesday, only a few days after another opposition
leader was convicted by a high court bench.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the rally held by the four-party opposition alliance,
Sadek Hossain Khoka, president of Dhaka City Chapter of BNP, said
the case was filed by the government "just to destroy the
popularity of our leader."
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Anti-Corruption on Tuesday submitted a charge-
sheet in a court of Dhaka accusing Khaleda Zia, her two cabinet
colleagues and eight officials for embezzlement of 34.8 million U.
S. dollars in purchase of two Airbuses in 1994 while she was in
power.
</P>
<P>
Two ministers of Khaleda Zia are former Finance Minister Saifur
Rahman and Civil Aviation Minister Major (Ret) Abdul Mannan.
</P>
<P>
The BNP chief has also been accused in another corruption case
involving nearly 120,000 dollars for decorating her Dhaka Garrison
residence while she was in power from 1991-1996.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believed that Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina is in a bid to destroy the popularity of the opposition
leaders before the general election next year.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the investigation of the case was
completed two years ago, but the government kept in hand only to
use it at an appropriate time to belittle Khaleda's popularity
before the national election in a bid to reap maximum political
dividends.
</P>
<P>
On August 24, Jatiya Party Chairman and former President Ershad
was sentenced by a high court bench for five years in prison and
fined nearly one million U.S. dollars on graft charges.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said that since Ershad's Jatiya Party
is one of the main partners of the opposition alliance, the case
of the former president was accelerated to destabilize the four-
party alliance led by BNP.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export Earnings Increased by 23 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Export earnings of Bangladesh
increased by 23 percent during the first month of current fiscal
year (2000-2001), in sharp contrast with the poor export
performance in last several years, a source in the Export
Promotion Bureau (EPB) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The export earnings in July this year amounted to 634 million U.
S. dollars, exceeding the target of 526 million dollars by 20
percent, the official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Major export earners, ready-made garments, tea, raw jute and
jute goods, chemical products and petroleum products, were among
the items which recorded high growth during this period.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's export growth fell by 8.27 percent during the last
fiscal year, the official said, blaming the decline in export
competitiveness on currency devaluation by South Asian and
Southeast Asian countries following the 1997 financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We had to readjust our currency over the past three years. But
we did that at a slower rate to avoid adverse impact on the
country's import-dependent economy," the EPB source said.
</P>
<P>
Aiming at promoting export and increasing foreign exchange
reserve, the Bangladeshi government has decided in August to
devaluate its currency by six percent from 51 taka against one
dollar to 54 against one.

ISLAMABAD, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Taliban militia of

<HEADLINE> Principle of Democracy Essential for Handling World Affairs: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Wednesday that the principle of democracy must be
advocated and implemented in handling world affairs, whether in
maintaining peace or promoting common development.
</P>
<P>
"All countries, big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are
equal members of the international community and have the right to
take part in and handle world affairs," Jiang said in his address
at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations that opened here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Matters that fall within the scope of sovereignty of a country
should be managed only by the government and people of that
country," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The world affairs," he added, "should be handled by the
governments and people of all countries through consultation."
</P>
<P>
"This is the principle of democracy in handling world affairs,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out the diversity of the universe, Jiang said "it is
essential to fully respect the diversity of different nations,
religions and civilizations."
</P>
<P>
"We should promote the exchanges between different
civilizations in a spirit of equality and democracy and encourage
them to learn form one another in order to attain common progress,
" Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for Strengthened Positive Role of U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin on Wednesday called for the strengthening of the United
Nations' positive role, and the defense of the world body's
authority, in the new century.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the U.N. Millennium Summit, Jiang said
that the organization's "positive role must be strengthened and
not weakened and its authority defended and not jeopardized."
</P>
<P>
"We must firmly defend the purposes and principles of the U.N.
Charter, continue to give play to the positive role of the U.N.
and its Security Council in handling international affairs and
safeguarding world peace, and ensure all the member states their
right to participate in world affairs on an equal footing," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"In handling international affairs," he said, "no country or
group of countries should take an attitude of 'using the United
Nations when it is needed and abandon it when it is not.'"
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the U.N., which came into being at the historic
moment of great victory in the world's anti-fascist war 55 years
ago, should be a place where all its member states discuss and
address international affairs through democratic means.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and its Security Council should go along with the
trend of history and carry out reforms as necessary and
appropriate under the principle of equitable geographical
distribution, so as to give expression to the will of all its
member states, developing countries in particular, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Over half a century and more, with the support of its member
states, the U.N. has done much useful work to ease regional
conflicts, eliminate old colonialism and promote world peace,
cooperation and development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"As the most authoritative international organization of
sovereign states with the broadest representation in the world,"
he emphasized, "the U.N. plays an irreplaceable role in the
maintenance of world peace, promotion of common development, and
establishment of a fair and reasonable new international political
and economic order."

<HEADLINE> Jiang: China's Development Contributes to World Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- China's development is
a contribution to world peace, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
Wednesday in his speech at the United Nations Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese civilization is one of the most ancient civilizations
in the world. It has added to the splendor of human civilization.
The founding of the People's Republic of China and the great
achievements it has scored in the course of nation-building
constitute an enormous contribution to world peace and development,
" Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Chinese people will unswervingly march
along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
and accomplish the grand cause of national reunification in
accordance with the principles of "peaceful reunification" and "
one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people love peace and stand firm in maintaining
world peace and stability. China will never seek hegemony. This is
a solemn commitment undertaken by the Chinese people to the world,
" he said, adding that China has consistently pursued an
independent foreign policy of peace and persisted in establishing
and developing friendly relations and cooperation with all
countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-
existence.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China has
always complied with the purposes and principles of the U.N.
Charter and supported the United Nations in playing its important
and irreplaceable role in safeguarding world peace and
international security and tackling global issues of all kinds.
China will, as always, fulfill its duties and obligations, the
Chinese President promised.
</P>
<P>
He also said that all the U.N. member states and their
statesmen invariably shoulder an important historic mission
entrusted by our times, that is to achieve a lasting world peace
and promote the common development and prosperity of all countries.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Chronicle of U.N. Peacekeeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The following is a chronicle
of United Nations peacekeeping operations since 1948.
</P>
<P>
In June 1948, the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO)
began its peace mission in the Middle East until now, which was
the earliest and longest U.N. peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
In November 1956, an emergency force, the first peacekeeping
force sent by the U.N., began to deploy in the Suez Cannel, Gaza
and Sinai region.
</P>
<P>
In July 1960, the U.N. began its peacekeeping operation in
Congo, participated by 19,828 soldiers from 30 countries, an
operation of the largest number of participating countries and
soldiers in the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
In March 1978, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
kicked off its peace mission, which proved to be the most
expensive operation which started in the Cold War era, with the
cost reaching 2.54 billion U.S. dollars until January 1996.
</P>
<P>
In October 1988, U.N. peacekeeping forces won the Nobel Peace
Prize.
</P>
<P>
In April 1989, the U.N. sent a Transition Assistance Group to
Namibia. China sent 20 observers, the first time for the country
to be involved in a U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
In November 1990, the "Desert Storm" operation was launched by
multinational forces in Iraq and Kuwait, which was one of the
earliest multinational forces under the U.N.
</P>
<P>
In March 1992, the U.N. sent a protective force of 39,922
soldiers to former Yugoslavia. The operation, which ended in 1996
and cost a total of 4.6 billion dollars, was one that involved the
most soldiers and the most expenditures in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
In March 1992, Russia for the first time formally participated
in a U.N. peacekeeping mission with a 900-strong battalion. In the
same month, a U.N. Transitional Authority in Cambodia was
established, which took charge of almost all the administrative
work in the country's transition period.
</P>
<P>
In June 1992, Japan adopted a law on assisting U.N.
peacekeeping missions, legalizing Japan's overseas military
presence.
</P>
<P>
In March 1993, the U.N. launched reserve funds for its
peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 the U.N. proposed a Standby Arrangements System and
signed agreements with its member states on such arrangements.
</P>
<P>
In March 1995, the U.N. sent a preventive force to Macedonia,
which was the first "preventive diplomacy" mission by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, a 55,000-strong U.N. Peace Enforcement Force
began its mission in Bosnia, which was the biggest operation till
now by multinational U.N. forces.
</P>
<P>
In June 1999, NATO peacekeeping forces (KFOR), consisting of
over 50,000 multinational troops, began its mission in Kosovo,
Yugoslavia, which was the biggest humanitarian intervention
operation.
</P>
<P>
In April 2000, 500 U.N. peacekeepers were held hostage in
Sierra Leone, causing the most serious hostage accident in the
history of U.N. peacekeeping operations.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Makes Speech On World Peace, Development at U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin on Wednesday delivered a speech on world peace and
development at the Millennium Summit of the United Stations, which
opened earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Jiang first appreciated the splendid material and spiritual
accomplishments mankind has scored in the outgoing millennium and
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
As the nearly 50-year-old Cold War has ended, Jiang said, the
pursuit of peace and development becomes both the common
aspirations of the people throughout the world and the theme of
our times.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the unfair and irrational old world political and
economic order, he said there is still a long way to go before the
two strategic issues of peace and development are solved and a
fair and equitable new international political and economic order
is established.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the people in many countries are still suffering
from the scourge of wars and turmoil. Hegemonism and power
politics still exist. Local conflicts caused by ethnic, religious,
territorial or resources factors keep cropping up. Separatist,
terrorist and extremist forces of various kinds are causing
incessant damages to the international community. Environment,
drugs, refugees and other global issues are more acutely felt,"
Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that history and the realities have
showed: first, respect for each other's independence and
sovereignty is vital to the maintenance of world peace; second,
building common security is the prerequisite to the prevention of
conflicts and wars; third, promoting a multipolar international
configuration is required by the progress of our times, conforms
to the interests of the people of all countries and also
contributes to world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
On relations between world peace and development, Jiang said
the maintenance of world peace is the necessary precondition for
the promotion of common development, which in turn serves as an
important guarantee for the maintenance of world peace.
</P>
<P>
The president also voiced great concerns about the widening gap
between the North and the South and the gulf between the rich and
the poor.
</P>
<P>
Imbalance in world development is becoming more acute. Over 1.3
billion people in the world live under the absolute poverty line,
with less than one U.S. dollar of living expenses per capita per
day. The developed countries possess 86 percent of the world's GDP
and occupy 82 percent of the world's export markets, while the
developing countries which account for the overwhelming majority
of the world population possess only 14 and 18 percent
respectively, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the right of the people of all countries to
choose their social system and development path independently must
be fully respected. North-South dialogue should be enhanced on the
basis of equality and South-South cooperation conducted
extensively.
</P>
<P>
He also called on developing countries to foster and strengthen
their capacity of self-development, and urged the creation of a
good external environment for the development of the vast number
of developing countries. All countries should remove trade
protectionism of all forms, and mutually open market. Effective
measures should be taken to reduce or exempt the debts of
developing countries and to increase official aid to them without
any conditions attached, Jiang added.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Defends Importing Toxic Waste for Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- South African Environment
Affairs Minister Valli Moosa on Wednesday defended a government
decision to allow 60 tons of hazardous mining waste to enter the
country for research purposes.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had not yet ratified an amendment to the Basel
Convention prohibiting the trans-boundary movement of hazardous
material which was destined for disposal, he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said nevertheless, the country was committed to responsible
global management of hazardous waste, including contributing to
research and exchange of information to rid the world of such
problems.
</P>
<P>
Moosa was reacting to claims by two local environment watchdog
bodies that a South African parastatal has imported 60 tons of
toxic waste from Australia which contained dangerously high levels
of lead and arsenic.
</P>
<P>
They said the export of hazardous waste from one Organization
of Economic Co-operation and Development state to another was
banned in terms of the convention, to which South Africa was a
signatory.
</P>
<P>
Moosa said South Africa had issued the permit to mineral and
metallurgical technology company Mintek with a clear understanding
that the shipment must have a liability insurance; the material
would be returned to Australia after the research was finished;
and the results of the research would be shared between the two
governments.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, this information will assist the Basel Convention
to manage this waste in a responsible and environmentally sound
manner, "Moosa said. "The research work undertaken by Mintek is a
contribution to promoting the globally agreed hierarchy of waste
management, which places a preference on recycling above disposal,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Needs to Strengthen Missile Capability: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Minister of Defense and
Armed Forces Logistics Ali Shamkhani stressed here on Thursday that
Iran needs to strengthen its missile capability to fight foreign
threats and safeguard national security.
</P>
<P>
Iran faces threats from advanced missile technology, which is
imported mainly from the West, he said at a seminar on aerospace
technology.
</P>
<P>
So Iran has to bid for a strong missile capability to safeguard
national security in face of contingent regional threats and
foreign threats, Shamkhani was quoted by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not mention which countries are posing threats
to Iran, but he is most likely referring to Israel, Tehran's arch
foe in the region that is militarily backed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran does not seek unconventional or offensive weapons,
despite allegations by Washington that Iran seeks to acquire
weapons of mass destruction and poses threats to Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister claimed that Iran now possesses aerospace
technology and is capable of using the technology in the military
or civilian industries.
</P>
<P>
His remarks echoed those of Navy Commander Rear Admiral Abbas
Mohtaj, who said on Tuesday that Iran's armed forces have achieved
self-sufficiency in military hardware and aerospace technology.
</P>
<P>
Iran has made a lot of missile tests in recent years. In July,
an upgraded Shahab-3 missile, with a range of 1,300 kilometers, was
successfully tested, causing concern in Israel and the U.S..

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Maintaining U.N. Security Council's Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
on Thursday called for the maintenance of the authority of the
United Nations Security Council in safeguarding world peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks here when addressing the U.N. Security
Council Summit, part of the three-day U.N. Millennium Summit which
opened on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said in his speech that in order to dissolve
contradictions and conflicts effectively and achieve a lasting
peace and common security, the purposes and principles of the U.N.
Charter must be strictly complied with.
</P>
<P>
"Disputes, if any, must be settled through dialogue,
negotiation and consultation," he said. The Security Council is,
according to the U.N. Charter, entrusted with the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and
security, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized, "Willful use of force and interference in the
internal affairs of other countries in the name of '
humanitarianism' not only run counter to the purposes and
principles of the U.N. Charter, but also will cause severe
negative consequences."
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is against the will of the vast number of the U.N.
member states to act whatever one likes and bypass the Security
Council on major issues pertaining to international peace and
security."
</P>
<P>
"We must work together to maintain, rather than undermine, the
authority of the Security Council, and to strengthen, rather than
weaken, its role," the Chinese president said.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeeping Operations Must Observe U.N. Charter: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said Thursday that it is essential to treat symptoms and remove
the root causes that lead to conflicts at the same time in order
to enable U.N. peacekeeping operations to work better.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made these remarks here when addressing the U.N. Security
Council Summit which was held today as part of the three-day UN
Millennium Summit that opened on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that peacekeeping operations constitute one of the
major means by which the United Nations fulfills its
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations should sum up its past experience and
lessons," Jiang said. "It is true that the peacekeeping operations
have contributed to international peace and security. But they are
not a panacea."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that facts have proven that the success of the U.
N. peacekeeping operations depends on observance of the purposes
and principles of the U.N. Charter, particularly the principles of
respect for state sovereignty, non-interference in the internal
affairs of the recipient countries, seeking prior consent of the
parties concerned, neutrality, and non-use of force except for
self-defense.

<HEADLINE> Geographical Equity Essential to Security Council Expansion: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here on Thursday that the expansion of the United Nations
Security Council should be based on the principle of equitable
geographical distribution.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at the Security Council Summit held at
the United Nations headquarters in New York. The meeting is part
of the U.N. Millennium Summit being held here from September 6 to
8.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that it is imperative for the
Security Council to reform itself where necessary so as to
strengthen its role, maintain its authority and improve its
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
But he told the summit meeting that the expansion of the
Security Council "should first of all address the under-
representation of the developing countries in the council".
</P>
<P>
"Any reform of the Security Council should adequately reflect
the will of the majority of the U.N. member states and only then,
can the reform stand the test of history," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "To this end, all the member states must have
detailed and patient discussions in order to reach consensus on
this issue."

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Draws World Attention to African Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here on Thursday that there will be no world peace and
prosperity to speak of without African stability and development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Summit Meeting of the Security Council of the
United Nations held at the world body's headquarters, Jiang said
that the current poor and backward situation of Africa was due to
long-time competition and plundering of old colonialism.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council summit is part of the U.N. Millennium
Summit Meeting being held here from September 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the United Nations and its Security Council
should pay greater attention to Africa, an important member of the
world community, and increase input into that continent.
</P>
<P>
He said that incessant turmoil and raging wars in many African
countries and regions have not only displaced innocent people and
plunged them into poverty, but also hindered the social and
economic development of Africa.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with problems facing Africa, Jiang stressed, the
United Nations and its Security Council "should fully respect the
sovereignty of African countries, pay close attention to the
opinions of African countries and regional organizations such as
the Organization of the African Union, and take effective measures
to keep African countries away from poverty and warfare and help
African people onto the road to tranquility, development and
rejuvenation."

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets U.N. Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan here this morning and
exchanged views with him on the affairs of the United Nations and
other major regional and world issues.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president congratulated the secretary-general on
the successful convening of the U.N. Millennium Summit, hoping
that the leaders of all countries would reach consensus on the
role of the United Nations in world affairs through extensive and
thorough exchange of views.
</P>
<P>
On the role of the United Nations, Jiang said that the United
Nations is the most important international organization in the
world today and it is in the common interests of all member states
to safeguard the purposes and principles of the Charter of the
United Nations and to enhance the U.N. role in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
He expressed China's support for the positive role played by
the United Nations and its Secretary-General in the world affairs.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the question of development, Jiang said that the
rapid development of economic globalization and the booming of
information technology have further widened the gap between the
developing and the developed nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is not enough just to solve the poverty of the
developing countries. A good external environment should also be
created for them while offering them funding, technological and
manpower support so as to help them bridge the "digital gap" and
make all the countries enjoying common development and prosperity
in the process of economic globalization, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also briefed Annan on the process of the ratification by
the Chinese Government of the "International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights", saying that since the signing of the
covenant in 1997, the Chinese Government has done an enormous work
in studies and preparations.
</P>
<P>
The consideration of the covenant is now underway in the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, said
Jiang, who expressed his hope the covenant would be approved as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that he listened earnestly to the speech Jiang
delivered at the U.N. Millennium Summit and expressed his thanks
and appreciation for China's consistent support for the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general, hoping that China would continue to play
its constructive role in world affairs, spoke highly of China's
policy towards Africa and wished success to the Sino-African forum
on cooperation slated for October in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> First Spouses Gather for Teach-in on Girls' Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The spouses of some 70
heads of state or government attending the current Millennium
Summit gathered here Thursday to exchange information, share
experience and draw attention to the gender gap that leaves
millions of girls out of school around the world.
</P>
<P>
Nane Annan, wife of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, was the
honorary chair of the gathering, organized by the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF). She opened the meeting, which also
included Cherie Blair, wife of the British prime minister, Stella
Obasanjo, wife of the Nigerian president, and some 70 other first
spouses.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy, who moderated an open
discussion among the participating first spouses, said their forum
focused on two major issues that often keep girls out of school:
concerns about their personal safety and the impact of child labor.
</P>
<P>
"The basic rights of women and girls are violated or ignored at
many points in their lives," Bellamy said prior to the meeting. "
But when a girl is deprived of an education, her entire trajectory
through life is diminished -- her health, her income, her
opportunities. That is unacceptable -- and it is completely
correctable. That's what this forum is about, and it is
outstanding that so many spouses of world leaders are taking this
issue personally."
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said that girls' education -- a top priority for UNICEF
-- is an essential element in the healthy development of any
society. She said that educated women tend to be healthier, raise
healthier families and have better-educated children than women
without the benefit of schooling.
</P>
<P>
Educated women are also better able to protect and support
themselves, their families and their children. They are more
productive at home and better paid in the workplace, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The social and economic benefits of educating girls have been
documented in country after country, and boys as well as girls
benefit when educational systems are free of gender bias," Bellamy
said.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF is a leading U.N. agency supporting the Girls' Education
Initiative, launched by the U.N. secretary-general at the World
Education Forum in Dakar, capital of Senegal, in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
Education for girls is also a priority issue in the secretary-
general's Millennium Report and is on the agenda for the
Millennium Summit, which began Wednesday at the U.N. headquarters
in New York.
</P>
<P>
In his report, the U.N. chief urged the world leaders, who are
at the three-day summit, to reduce the gender gap in education by
2005 and to ensure that all children, regardless of gender, are
getting a quality basic education by 2015.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF, the only U.N. organization dedicated exclusively to
children, works for child protection, survival and development
within the framework of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
Created by the United Nations General Assembly in 1946 to meet
the emergency needs of children in post-war Europe, UNICEF now
supports programs aimed at improving the lives of children
everywhere, particularly those in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Meets at Heads of State Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of the United
Nations Security Council at the heads of state level was held here
Thursday with the focus on peacekeeping issues, especially in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The security council summit considered a report issued in late
August by a special U.N. panel which was set up by the U.N.
secretary-general to consider how to strengthen peace operations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said, "To say that the eyes of the world are upon you is
both to say too little and to much."
</P>
<P>
"Too little, because the fate of future generations could be
affected by the decisions of this security council summit. Too
much, because many in the present generation are losing confidence
in the ability of the United Nations to make the difference
between war and peace," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"This contradiction reflects a crisis of credibility facing
this council and this organization in discharging its gravest
responsibility: the maintenance of peace and security," the U.N.
chief said.
</P>
<P>
"Too many vulnerable communities in too many regions of the
world now hesitate to look to the United Nations to assist them in
their hour of need," he said.
</P>
<P>
"No amount of resolutions or statements can change this reality.
Only actions can: prompt, united and effective action, pursued
with skills and discipline to halt conflict and restore the peace.
Only such determined action can restore the reputation of the
United Nations as a credible force for peace and justice," he
added.
</P>
<P>
A declaration was adopted by the end of the summit in which the
council pledged to uphold the purposes and principles of the
Charter of the United Nations and reaffirmed its commitment to the
principles of sovereign equality, national sovereignty,
territorial integrity and political independence of all states.
</P>
<P>
The council also reaffirmed the importance of adhering to the
principles of the non-threat or non-use of force in international
relations in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the
United Nations, and of peaceful settlement of international
disputes.
</P>
<P>
The security council comprises five permanent members and ten
nonpermanent members.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator Meets With Belarusian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MINSK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng
and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko agreed during their
talks here Thursday that the two sides will make joint efforts to
push forward bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC), who is on an official visit to
Belarus, said that there are great potentials of cooperation
between China and Belarus as they are "good friends" and "good
partners."
</P>
<P>
President Lukashenko, who had just returned from the millennium
summit conference at the United Nations, said Li's visit is of
great significance to the development of relations between Belarus
and China.
</P>
<P>
The president called Li a respected "old friend" of the Belarus
people, saying China and Belarus have treated each other with
sincerity, and that China is a "trustworthy" friend of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Li last visited Belarus in 1995. He and Lukashenko had an
extensive exchange of views on the development of bilateral
political relations and economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said China attaches great importance to its relations
with Belarus, and that China is satisfied with the growth of
bilateral ties. He added that he is also glad to see the growing
trade relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko briefed Li Peng on the events at the millennium
summit conference in New York. He said he had listened carefully
to President Jiang Zemin's speech and found that Belarus share
common views with China on many international issues.
</P>
<P>
In addition, both Li and Lukashenko said they share same or
similar views on multi-polarization of the world, the economic
globalization and the building of a new international order as
well as on human rights, anti-hegemonism and non-interference into
other nation's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li ended his visit to Belarus after the talks. He then traveled
to Tallinn, capital of Estonia, for the next leg of his journey.

<HEADLINE> Conditions Are Not Ripe for Talks With U.S., Iran Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Khatami, on his second visit to New York to attend the United
Nations General Assembly session, told a press conference that
there had been some positive developments in relations but the
United States must do more to make amendments for past wrongs
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iranian president renewed demands for an apology
for the U.S. role in a 1953 coup that overthrew Iranian Prime
Minister Mohammad Mossadeq despite U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's acknowledgment in April of U.S.
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"Contacts between the people of Iran and the United States have
been positive," he said. "Relations are not only based on pure
misunderstanding. There are some positive elements."
</P>
<P>
Khatami was in New York to attend the three-day Millennium
Summit, which kicked off here Wednesday. U.S. President Bill
Clinton is also in New York and on Wednesday the leaders of Iran
and the United States listened to each other's speeches at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The mere presence of both presidents at the United Nations
headquarters in New York sparked the possibility of an encounter,
even by coincidence. But Khatami indicated that any such meeting
would be premature because Iran still had "serious issues" with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said a meeting between Iranian parliament speaker Mehdi
Karroubi and U.S. lawmakers in New York last week had been an
unplanned encounter and did not presage talks between the two
governments.
</P>
<P>
"For a president to meet officially with officials of another
country, the political and historical setting has to be available,
" he said. "Unfortunately, such settings are not yet available
between our countries."
</P>
<P>
Among the obstacles, Khatami listed U.S. unilateral trade
sanctions, U.S. opposition to building pipelines to carry Caspian
oil and gas exports across Iranian territory and what he called "
animosities and allegations" against Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We need apologies for that as well as some practical measures
and steps that prove that in reality that (U.S.) behavior has
changed," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. legislation punishing oil companies that invest in Iran's
energy sector is due to expire next year unless the U.S. Congress
renews it.
</P>
<P>
Iran severed diplomatic relations with the United States in
April 1980, and there have been signs of improvement on the
bilateral ties since Khatami came to power in August 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Moves Closer to Vote on China Trade Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate voted 92-5
Thursday to proceed to final consideration of a bill to grant
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status to China, paving
the way for a vote on the bill next week.
</P>
<P>
The Senate also rejected an amendment by Minnesota Democratic
Sen. Paul Wellstone calling on China to increase religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which was the first of many proposed amendments
threatening the passage of the PNTR bill, was defeated by a vote
of 69-28.
</P>
<P>
The PNTR bill was approved by the House of Representatives 237-
197 in May this year and the Senate is expected to follow suit
when a final vote comes next week.
</P>
<P>
While the Senate's move was welcomed by the White House and
business circles in the country, a few anti-China senators such as
Jesse Helms from North Carolina and Paul Wellstone from Minnesota
are vowing to prepare amendments linking the trade bill with human
rights, religious freedom and labor rights.
</P>
<P>
Senators Fred Thompson and Robert Torricelli, who introduced a
legislation to impose sanctions against China and other countries
if weapons proliferation was confirmed, have threatened to make it
an amendment to the PNTR bill if Democrats refused to vote on it.
</P>
<P>
According to the Congressional rules, if any amendments are
adopted, the PNTR bill has to be sent back to the House for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
"This would create real chaos if it went back to the House,"
Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said
Wednesday. "It would probably mean the end of PNTR for the year."
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has made passage of the PNTR bill his
top legislative priority for his final year in office.
</P>
<P>
White House officials have warned that a further delay in
Senate passage of the PNTR bill could have serious implications
for the U.S. foreign and security policy and would cost U.S.
businesses billions of dollars in loss.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) Thursday lauded
the Senate's overwhelming vote to proceed with consideration of
PNTR with China, but warned of complacency until it has been
passed and signed into law.
</P>
<P>
"For years, the only thing more impenetrable than the Great
Wall of China has been her domestic markets, and today's vote
marks a decisive step toward opening them for American companies
and workers," said Frank Vargo, NAM vice president for
international economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we can't rest until the ink has dried on the
president's signature on final passage of PNTR," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that of particular concern is the legislation
introduced by senators Thompson and Torricelli.

<HEADLINE> No Dead Fish Found on UAE Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- No dead fish has been found
yet on the United Arab Emirates' (UAE) shore, nor have the
country's Coast Guard witnessed any Red tide these days, reported
the official news agency on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the Dubai Municipality has taken necessary precautionary
measures since finding millions of dead fish near neighboring Omani
shores last week, which was reportedly an ecological phenomenon
that may spread to the eastern shores of the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has also taken specimens of fish coming from
Oman for analysis and the final results will come out Saturday,
said the agency. But the experts have so far turned up no traces of
contamination, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Engineer Redha Salman, head of the Environment Protection
Section at the Dubai municipality believed the ecological disaster
may be caused by the "red tide" because it can lead to temperature
changes of the waters and a surplus of plankton, which secrete
biotoxins that attack the nervous system of certain species.

ANKARA -- The European Union (EU) has donated 1.5 million doses
of vaccines to Turkey to counter the foot-and-mouth disease among
cattle in western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of the vaccines arrived in Turkey on Wednesday
and the second batch will be carried in soon.
</P>

<P>
ANKARA -- The visiting Director General of Development Aid
Department of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC),
Shozo Kitta, said on Wednesday the bank would continue to support
Turkey's development projects.
</P>
<P>
Kitta, who is heading a JBIC delegation, told reporters the bank
is financing three important projects in Turkey with a total cost
of 1 billion U.S. dollars. These projects are Istanbul Water Supply
Project, Bozuyuk-Mekece Road Development Project and the Bosphorus

<P>
The European Parliament has asked Turkey to exclude nuclear
energy projects from the regulations which define economic and
social aid.

OMAN -- Israeli exports to Arab nations were estimated at 101
million dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
This figure includes direct trade dealings with some Arab
countries and illegal ones with some quarters in Arab nations which
still boycott Israeli products, the Association of Israeli Plant
Owners said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has declared official relations with Jordan, Egypt, the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and Mauritania and established
trade bonds with Qatar, Oman and Tunisia via representative offices
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Yet, other Arab nations are averse to any sort of trade exchange
with Israel unless it withdraws from all occupied Arab territories.

<HEADLINE> Gulf IT Companies Warned Over E-commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Experts of the United Arab
Emirates' Dubai Internet City have warned Gulf IT companies over
their slow response to the fast developing new Internet-dependant
economy, local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Al Gergawi, general director of Dubai Technology, E-
Commerce and Media Free Zone said that despite all the government
support, there were still many companies being afraid to enter the
new technological economy.
</P>
<P>
"This is having a negative effect on the Arab economy in the
Gulf and is slowing down both the government and private sector,"
he said, adding that "will lead the companies which are still using
traditional methods of business towards lower production, and also
hamper their ability to compete with international companies."
</P>
<P>
Despite the prediction that e-commerce growth in the Arab Gulf
region is expected to reach up to 3 billion U.S. dollars by the
year 2003, this is a small figure in comparison with 1.3 trillion
dollars in the international market.
</P>
<P>
The warning comes just one month before the official opening of
Dubai Internet City, the first electronic free Zone of its kind in
the world, and it can offer companies 100 percent foreign ownership
and 50 year renewable leases, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Hariri Vows to Develop Economic Ties With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese ex-premier Rafik
Hariri, who is most likely to recapture the portfolio, said on
Thursday that Lebanon should expedite economic relations with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Hariri made the remarks in a banquet to celebrate the victory of
his "Dignity Group" in the just-concluded parliament elections. The
group swept off 18 seats in 19 quotas in the elite Beirut
electorate.
</P>
<P>
"The new Syrian authority has opened a mass market and many
opportunities for us that we can benefit from with our Syrian
brothers," Hariri said, adding,"We can see it clearly from (Syrian
President) Bashar al-Assad's statement when he was sworn in that
the new authority is keen to open up towards outsides."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his dissatisfaction towards the current economic
ties between the two countries. "We see a good political relation
and enjoy a good security relation. We should also have a
satisfactory economic one," he announced.
</P>
<P>
Hariri added that Lebanon will be the first country that can be
affected by the opening wave from Syria. "Our two countries should
work together so as to benefit from the markets and productions,"
the billionaire politician stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hariri, who is the hottest candidate for the
premiership, said the new government should be a solidary one to
address those challenges in the future.
</P>
<P>
The ex-premier, who served from 1992-1998, elaborated that the
economic problems are linked with political and social
situations. "To cure the economic crisis we should not focus
our attention on the economic policies. The crisis is a result of
all domestic and foreign policies," he said, adding, "We have to
form a united government to save Lebanon, to save our people."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is experiencing the harshest economic depression in
three decades. Partly, the crisis helped Hariri defeat his rival,
sitting Prime Minister Salim Hoss who lost his deputy seat in the
election.

KAMPALA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni vowed on Thursday to root out rebels of the Allied
Democratic Forces who disturbed civilians in the west of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally during his visit to Hoima district where

He called on the population to be on the look-out and report
all suspicious activities to the appropriate authorities, and
urged security organs to respond promptly to every information

<HEADLINE> French, British Experts Confirm Objective of Letting Concorde Fly Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- French and British aviation
officials and experts Thursday confirmed their objective of
finding a solution to let the Concorde supersonic aircraft fly
again.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting held at the headquarters of General Direction
of Civil Aviation (DGAC) here, the working group of French and
British experts studied the primary report submitted by the French
Bureau of Accident Investigation (BEA) on the July 25 Concorde
crash in which 113 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft builders are concentrating their investigation on
possible tire explosion, fuel tank leakage and origin of fire,
said DGAC.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot said on
Wednesday that he thought Concorde should be allowed to fly again
in future.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain have permanently suspended the airworthiness
certificate of Concorde after the July 25 crash near Paris.
</P>
<P>
Primary investigation showed that the crash could be caused by
the cutting of the tire on the undercarriage by a metal strip on
the runway.
</P>
<P>
The explosion of one or two tires then led to the damage of
fuel tanks, the leaking of oil, and the outbreak of a fire.

<HEADLINE> Seismological Experts Warn of Major Earthquake in Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland could soon be
struck by a major earthquake, according to seismological experts
from the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, the experts predicted that,
based on statistical analysis, a large tremor is due to hit
Switzerland, and that thousands of people may be at risk.
</P>
<P>
They said a major earthquake, on the scale of that which struck
Basel in the year of 1356, reaching the equivalent of between 6.5
and 7 on the Richter scale, could be expected to strike the
country every 100 years on average.
</P>
<P>
They warned that 95 percent of Swiss buildings would be unable
to withstand a major earthquake. They said the vulnerability of
the infrastructure could lead to hundreds if not thousands of
deaths, and cause material damage of up to 100 billion Swiss
francs (about 56 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hugo Baumann, a professor of building statistics and
construction at the Institute said only buildings constructed
after 1989 were built to withstand earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Baumann and his colleagues recommended that stricter rules
regarding construction be implemented across the building trade,
saying that rules introduced in 1989 were not sufficiently binding.
</P>
<P>
Baumann said the risks posed by earthquakes in Switzerland were
greater than those of any other natural dangers, including floods,
storms and avalanches.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Priorities of Action to Eradicate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- France stressed here
Thursday that priorities of action must be set so as to pull
billions of people out of abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a roundtable of heads of state or government,
French President Jacques Chirac, who is here attending the U.N.
Millennium Summit which opened at the U.N. headquarters in New
York Wednesday, said there are more than 800 million people who
are still hungry and 1.2 billion people are living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Half of humankind is living on less than 2 dollars a day and
suffering from the succession of ills that exacerbate the
precariousness of their situation: illiteracy, unemployment,
unhealthy housing, lacking of hygiene and health care, Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
Priorities of action must be set, including increasing official
development assistance, accelerating debt relief for the heavily
indebted poor countries, starting a new round of global trade
talks to make trade more compliant with rules and intensifying the
fight against major diseases, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Increasing official development assistance is crucial for
promoting the establishment of institutions for good governance,
fostering environmentally sensitive economic development and
developing social programs to reduce poverty through technology
transfers and technical assistance, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that assistance is particularly necessary for the
poorest countries and is absolutely necessary to enable them to
build the social and economic infrastructures they need to break
out of the vicious cycle of isolation, illiteracy and disease.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit, which is the largest-ever gathering of
world leaders in the U.N. history, is convened under the official
theme "The United Nations in the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
In addition to make formal speeches at the summit, the world
leaders also participate in one of four interactive roundtables.

<HEADLINE> EP Slams British Call for Human Embryo Cloning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament on
Thursday slammed a call by Britain's chief medical officer to
allow British scientists to clone human embryos for use in medical
research.
</P>
<P>
The parliament, the legislative body of the European Union,
passed a non-binding resolution that says that therapeutical
cloning for medical research irreversibly crosses a boundary in
research norms and that no EU money should be used to fund such
research.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed with 237 votes for and 230 votes
against in Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
Philippe Busquin, EU research commissioner, said that EU rules
already have excluded spending research cash on human cloning for
either reproductive or therapeutical purposes.
</P>
<P>
The British government's chief medical officer Liam Donaldson
recommended in August that the country's scientists be allowed to
clone human embryos for use in a wider range of medical research.
</P>
<P>
The British parliament in 1990 approved embryo research for
infertility and genetic disorder treatments.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the chief of the 15-nation European Union expressed
his support for a debate on the sensitive topic of therapeutical
cloning.
</P>
<P>
Romano Prodi said that an equilibrium could be struck through
the debate between ethical concerns and commercial benefits of
therapeutical cloning.
</P>
<P>
The union's fifth Framework Program for Research and Technology
Development from 1998 to 2002 excludes financial support for any
research projects concerning the cloning of human embryos for the
purpose of reproduction.
</P>
<P>
Therapeutical cloning involves two basic techniques -- cellular
therapy and formation of embryos via cloning.
</P>
<P>
Cellular therapy has been used for several years already to
cure such diseases as leukemia and it aims at replacing diseased
human cells or at increasing insufficient cells in human bodies.
</P>
<P>
This therapy also has a prospect of being able to cure
degenerative diseases such as the Alzheimer and Parkinson
syndromes.
</P>
<P>
Yet the cellular therapy has displayed an inefficiency in
dealing with such problems as incompatible immunology, lack of
transplant organs and absence of graftable cells for several types
of human tissues.
</P>
<P>
Therapeutical cloning is expected to be able to cope with these
problems.
</P>
<P>
The therapeutical cloning will replace the nucleus of ovum with
a cell taken from the patient to be treated and the embryo thus
created will only be used to provide the cells that will later be
transplanted back onto the patient in question.

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Auction UMTS Licenses in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Belgium is set to auction
four UMTS licenses in December to follow suit as Britain, the
Netherlands and Germany did to upgrade their mobile telephone
systems.
</P>
<P>
The licenses will allow the winning bidders to provide high-
speed mobile telecommunications service in the next 20 years but
what qualification terms companies have to meet to be able to take
part in the auction were not yet announced.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson from the Belgian telecommunications ministry
only said that the Belgian auction of UMTS licenses would be
organized the same way as in Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The ministry did not disclose what the expected auction
proceeds would be.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, that expected to net a huge amount of money
from UMTS auctions, ended up only getting 6 billion Dutch guilders
(2.6 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
UMTS stands for universal mobile telecommunications standard,
the latest generation of cellular phone service. UMTS boasts of a
transmission speed 40 times faster than that of the existing GSM
standard.
</P>
<P>
The higher telecommunication speed makes possible new
capabilities such as mobile phone connection to the Internet and
video displays.
</P>
<P>
Britain was the first European Union country to have auctioned
UMTS licenses. In April, the British government got 22.5 billion
pounds (34 billion U.S. dollars) from the auction sales of five
UMTS licenses.

<HEADLINE> Euro Keeps Hitting New Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The euro plunged on Thursday
to its lowest level in its 20-month life against the U.S. dollar
as confidence in the single currency was further dented by
conflicting comments from EU officials
</P>
<P>
The single currency once fell to 86.35 cents against the dollar,
crushing the previous day's low of 86.85 cents.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had
played a leading role in the euro's plunge in the past three days
after he said that he was not concerned about the euro's weakness
and after his office repeated his lack of concern.
</P>
<P>
The German finance ministry, however, on Thursday tried to prop
up the euro by saying that Germany was "eminently interested" in a
strong euro and German and French finance ministers said the euro
zone finance ministers were meeting on Friday and were expected to
issue a statement concerning the euro.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the European
Union, said that the current exchange rate against the dollar was
not appropriate.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank's silence on the latest fall of the
euro was also blamed by analysts who said that the bank's silence
and the conflicting comments by European leaders only left the
single currency at the mercy of speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank has consistently warned that a weak
euro is fueling inflation in the 15-nation bloc in that it makes
imports relatively more expensive.
</P>
<P>
The bank has just raised its benchmark lending interest rate by
a quarter point on August 31 to help bolster the weakening
currency. Raising interest rates is usually a move that tends to
bolster local currency.
</P>
<P>
The euro was launched on January 1, 1999, at a value of 1.18
dollars and now it has devalued by more than a quarter.

<P>
OTTAWA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada will send a trade
mission in mid-September to central Europe to tap more market
potential, Canadian International Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More than 54 Canadian companies will join the mission led by
Pettigrew between September 10 to 15 to Hungary, Slovakia, the
Czech Republic and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
"Central Europe offers Canadian enterprises a great many
untapped opportunities with the rise of its new market economies,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's trade in the region has increased over the past five
years, but it needs to be more actively encouraged," he added.

<P>
According to Canadian government sources, the North American
country's two-way merchandise trade with the four central European
countries exceeded 500 million Canadian dollars (about 337.5

</P>
<P>
The Canadian government put its direct investment in the region
at 1.5 million dollars (about 1 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The mission represents all regions of Canada and a wide range

telecommunications, environment, agri-food, energy, transportation,
construction, financial services and medicine, the government said.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Services Held in Greece for Earthquake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday conducted
memorial services for the victims of the catastrophic earthquake
that hit Athens on September 7 last year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 143 people were killed and thousands of others
injured and hundreds of houses were also destroyed in the
earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale. The epicenter was
in the Mount Parnitha region, some 20 kilometers northwest of the
Greek capital.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government announced recently that the cost of the
earthquake would rise to 900 billion drachmas (about 2.37 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, in churches throughout the quake-striken area such
as Menidi, Metamorphosi, Ano Liosia, Anthoupoli and at the ruins
of the Ricomex factory building that claimed the lives of 40
people, emotional scenes were being played out at memorial
services for the dead.
</P>
<P>
The services were attended by Greek environment and Town
Planning Minister Costas Laliotis, Transport and Communications
Minister Christos Verelis, a representative of the Greek President
Costis Stephanopoulos and other government officials.
</P>
<P>
The services ended with a minute's silence in memory of the
victims, after which the Greek government delegation visited
nearby camps and were briefed on the problems facing earthquake
victims living there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, acting Greek government spokesman Telemachos Hytiris
expressed the government's sorrow to the relatives of the
earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government would make full restitution to the
earthquake victims and a special government meeting to discuss the
issues would be held as soon as Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis returned from New York where he is currently taking part
in the U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Vasilis Papazachos, a professor at
the Thessaloniki's Aristotle University, said Thursday that the
Athens earthquake which was not that strong to cause so many
victims was an additional motivation for the intensification of
the research concerning the earthquake prediction.
</P>
<P>
He said that it would soon be possible to say if a medium-term
earthquake prediction was possible.
</P>
<P>
The professor was optimistic that the prediction of earthquakes
two years before they occur, their magnitude and their epicenter
with a proximity of 60 kilometers would be possible.

</P>
<P>
The reduction will start in 2001 and the main steps are to be
completed by 2003. It is planned that Russia's armed forces will
have been reduced by 350,000 servicemen by that time and will
total 850,000, Interfax cited "reliable sources in Moscow" as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Land Forces will decrease by almost 180,000 servicemen, the
Navy by over 50,000 and the Air Force by about 40,000, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The personnel of other power structures will also be greatly
reduced, the sources said. The internal troops of the Russian
Interior Ministry are expected to be reduced by over 20,000. The
number of railway troops will be reduced by 10,000 and the Federal
Border Guard Service will be reduced by 5,000.
</P>
<P>
Other ministries and agencies that have military formations
will be reduced by a total of over 25,000 people, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In all, the Russian armed forces and other power structures
will cut down their staff by about 400,000.
</P>
<P>
Serious reorganization will also be carried out in the
administration of the Defense Ministry and rear structures,
including military medicine.
</P>
<P>
"Radical reduction is also expected in the Strategic Missile
Force, which will see a reduction of some 10 missile divisions by
2006," the sources said. The space missile defense troops and the
space military forces will be taken out of this branch of service
in 2001 and will be put under the control of the Russian General
Staff, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Strategic Missile Force is expected to be transformed into
an independent arm of service in 2002, and later, approximately in
2006, to be included in the Russian Air Force, they said.
</P>
<P>
Such a radical reduction is planned because the state cannot
adequately finance the structures, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry, the General Staff, the Finance Ministry
and the Ministry for Industry, Science and Technologies, which is
in charge of issues relating to state defense orders, are
currently calculating how much funding will be required for the
planned reforms.
</P>
<P>
Next year, funding for defense expenditures will mainly be
spent on planned reforms, research and design work as well as on
upgrading and repairs of military technology. It is not planned to
purchase large batches of new samples of weapons and military
technology, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The final decision has not yet been made "at the highest
political level," where the final parameters of reduction will be
determined, they said.

CAIRO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The half-month second stage of the Egyptian annual
summer sale started Wednesday, involving 5,000 public and private
shops and enterprises, an official with the Ministry of Supply and
Domestic Trade said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Violations of sale regulations in the first stage reached 650,
the Arabic Al-Alam Al-Youm quoted the official as saying. Intensive
crackdowns have been launched against the department stores which
offer expired or bad commodities, added the official.
</P>
<P>
MASCAT -- Oman will invest 2.65 billion Omani riyals (about 7
billion U.S. dollars) in industry during the next 10 years as part
of efforts to diversify investment that had been focused on energy,
an official at the Omani Ministry of Trade and Industry has said.
</P>
<P>
Oman will gradually turn from a country depending on energy and
foreign labor into one relying on industry and local manpower,
added the official. Foreign workers constitutes 25 percent of
Oman's 2.3 million population.
</P>
<P>
As a small oil-producer, Oman is not a member of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and produces
900,000 barrels of oil per day. Oil and gas earnings accounted for
70 percent of its national income in 1999.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey and Czech Republic signed an agreement of
cooperation on agriculture and food industry in Prague on Thursday,
reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The pact was signed by Turkish Minister of Agriculture and Rural
Affairs Husnu Yusuf Gokalp and his Czech counterpart Jan Fencl.
</P>
<P>
Gokalp said that Turkey and Czech Republic, besides advancing
cooperation in agriculture, should also support each other's EU
candidacy policies.
</P>
<P>
"As two EU candidates, we should form a cooperation platform
between our two countries to make good use of the EU candidacy
process. Turkey and the Czech Republic should support each other's
candidacy to the EU and also they should benefit from each other's
experiences," said Fencl.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey and Yemen signed a series of cooperation
agreements in Ankara on Thursday, reported the Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The accords, which were signed by Turkish State Minister Ramazan
Miraoglu and Yemeni Trade and Supply Minister Abdullaziz Al Kymain,
cover highway transportation, cooperation in tourism and
encouragement of investments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a memorandum of understanding was signed by Mehmet
Guler, director general and president of the Executive Board of the
Anatolia News Agency, and the Yemeni minister, on behalf of Yemeni
News Agency, which foresees cooperation between the news agencies
of two countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Opposes OPEC Oil Output Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq reiterated on Thursday
that it opposes oil production increase by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA),
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid said, "All facts have
confirmed that the quantity of oil is sufficient in meeting the
world demand."
</P>
<P>
Rashid said that to keep the international oil market stable and
protect the interests of OPEC member states, Iraq rejects the
pressure exerted on OPEC members by the United States who aims at "
overflowing the market with the Saudi oil," the INA said.
</P>
<P>
The recent decision by Saudi Arabia to increase oil production
by 600 thousand barrels a day "constitutes a challenge and
violation of OPEC regulations," Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq regarded that the "surprising" move by Saudi Arabia, a key
U.S. ally in the Middle East, came under the U.S. pressure to push
down oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister urged the upcoming OPEC oil ministers meeting
to adopt a stance that is "capable of reflecting OPEC member
states' interests."
</P>
<P>
As to the appointment of a new OPEC secretary general to succeed
outgoing Rilwanu Lukman, Rashid stressed that Lukman's successor
should be able to resist external pressure, especially that from
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Iraq deems that Abdul Ameer Al-Nbari, the former Iraqi envoy to
the United Nations, is "a suitable and efficient person" to assume
the job, Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
Rashid will lead an Iraqi delegation to attend the oil ministers
meeting due to be held in the Austrian capital Vienna on September
10.
</P>
<P>
OPEC is expected to make the decision to increase its daily
production by another half million barrels a day at the meeting.
The world's largest oil cartel has increased its oil output by 2.4
million barrels a day this year.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices reached a 10-year record high of 32.85 U.S. dollars a
barrel on Monday, while benchmark Brent crude for October traded at
a new high of 32.88 dollars on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and the European Union have been pressuring OPEC in
raising oil production to cool down the oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Raps 3 Policemen for Abusing Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami Thursday blasted three Israeli border
policemen for allegedly beating and abusing Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very serious matter," Ben-Ami, who now also
temporarily holds the foreign ministry portfolio, said in an
interview with Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The three policemen reportedly stopped a car with three
Palestinians and later beat them with fists and rocks at a
roadblock between Jerusalem and Abu Dis, an Arab town on the
outskirts of Jerusalem, on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
They also reportedly made the three Palestinians lie on the
ground, stepped on their throats, and pointed guns at them for
posing for camera.
</P>
<P>
With the aid of human right groups, the Palestinian victims
filed a complaint to Israeli police over the matter, which led to
the arrest of the three policemen on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three suspects will be brought before a judge Thursday
evening with a request to remand them in custody until trial,
according to Border Police spokesman Peretz Razon.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that the Justice Ministry's Police
Investigation Unit will help determine whether to press charges
against them.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami warned that the police investigation unit should not be
used as an alibi. "We can't have people apparently acting like
animals and then say 'OK, the police investigation unit will deal
with it,' thus alleviating ourselves of our command
responsibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered a series of discipline measures to prevent
such "ugly things" from happening again in the future, including a
plan to introduce behavior refresher courses to all members of the
Border Police.
</P>
<P>
The Border Police is the elite task force in the police
infrastructure, dealing mainly with internal security problems and
fighting against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
According to Ha'aretz daily's website, one suspect told its
reporters before Thursday evening's hearing: "What we did is not
special. Everybody (in the unit) does it."

<HEADLINE> Israel Tries Hard to Encourage Students Study Hi-Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Council for
Higher Education on Thursday agreed on a plan to encourage more
students in Israel to study hi-tech by promising bright job
opportunities and lucrative scholarships.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after the council, which has proposed a
series of emergency measures to attract hi-tech staff and students,
met with hi-tech leaders on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, each student who studies for a master's degree
in hi-tech will be granted a scholarship of 50,000 shekels (about
12,500 U.S. dollars) and for a doctorate, 60,000 shekels (15,000
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to address the acute shortage of hi-tech
engineers and computer programers in Israel, which is rated the
fastest developing country in the hi-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
The growth pace of the Israeli hi-tech industry, which employs
some 60,000 people, is however hindered by a lack of about 10,000
skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
The plan tabled by the Council of Higher Education also allows
full-time faculty members from universities to work one or two days
a week in hi-tech firms. They will be entitled to accept the
attractive compensation packages offered in the hi-tech sector,
including stock options.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, suitable hi-tech personnel are also encouraged
to take academic posts in universities in addition to their regular
jobs. They would continue to draw their full salary from their
companies, in addition to getting paid by the academic institution
they teach.
</P>
<P>
As the hi-tech industry has become probably the most lucrative
and promising field in Israel, there is also an increasing number
of students graduating with degrees in computer science and
electrical engineering.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, there were 2,000 graduates in these hi-tech fields. The
number, according to a prediction of the council, would reach 5,000
when students of the class of 2002 graduate. The increase of
students further creates a shortage of faculty members in computer
science and electrical engineering.
</P>
<P>
Israel's hi-tech industry contributes half the growth figures
for the economy. Israel's growth rate in 2000 is expected to be 4.4
percent. Without hi-tech, however, this would have been only 2.4
percent, according to a think tank paper presented to the Israeli
parliament at the end of July.

<HEADLINE> Healthy Environment for Trade Expected in Angola: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Angola will enjoy better days
in near future that will allow trade activities in a healthy
environment with free flow of people and goods, said the country's
Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Zacarias
Sambeny here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Angola is at present making a set of macro-economic reforms in

different economic sectors," he was quoted by the official news
agency Angop as saying during a three-day seminar on agricultural
business between Angola and Brazil.
</P>

The seminar, starting on Thursday, aims to get Brazilian
experience in livestock raising and promote business cooperation
through setting up partnerships, Sambeny said.
</P>
<P>
In his turn, Brazilian Ambassador to Angola Jorge Taunay said
agriculture will be an inevitable component for cooperation with
the southwest African country.

<HEADLINE> At Least Two Killed by Landslide in Angola's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- At least two people have been
killed by an unexpected landslide taking place in a densely
populated suburb of Luanda, the capital of Angola, the official
news agency Angop reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The landslide destroyed a house which was used as a "video club
" for low income people. At least 15 people were inside the house
when the tragedy occurred Wednesday evening, eyewitnesses was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Firemen went to the scene of the disaster immediately and
removed the dead bodies of two youngsters, while more people are
believed to be still under the mass of earth.
</P>
<P>
The area where the earth fall occurred has been under a Luanda
government's construction ban since 1990, but many people, mostly
war displaced persons from inland provinces, ignored the
prohibition and settled themselves there in shanty houses.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the population of the Angolan capital
has increased by 53 percent from 2.3 million in 1995 to 3.5
million in early 2000, mainly due to the augment of the war-
displaced population.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there are some 3.7 million displaced persons in
the southwest African country as a result of a 26-year civil
conflict between the government and the rebel National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola.

LUANDA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Guinea-Bissau President Kumba
Iala issued a decree Wednesday to exonerate all the government
members of the Resistance of Guinea-Bissau (RGB), one of the two
parties forming the coalition government, Jornal de Angola
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
RGB has been the second largest party of the country since the
general elections held last November, during which Iala became the
president. RGB, united with the Social Renovation Party (PRS) led
by Iala, gained a relative majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
After some divergences, the RGB leadership wrote a letter to
Iala on Wednesday, saying that the accord on coalition signed by
the two parties has not been observed.
</P>
<P>
As response, Iala issued the decree, which in practice
announced the collapse of the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The ruling PRS has to opt between the establishment of a
minority government or soliciting support from the third largest
party of the country, the African Party of Independence of Guinea
and Cape Verde, until October when the next session of the
parliament will be held.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says No New Mideast Meetings Scheduled Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Thursday that no new meetings as yet were scheduled with
Israeli and Palestinian leaders after his talks with them on
Wednesday evening failed to achieve a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not rule out further meetings with the two leaders
this week but said Thursday that there has been no discussion of
another three-way summit to break the impasse in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, talking to reporters before his private meeting with
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, said that his talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat went well.
</P>
<P>
"They both very much want an agreement and they understand they
have a limited time in which to achieve it. And we discussed a
whole range of things in terms of where we were and where we are
going," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was planning another Camp David-style summit with
the Palestinian and Israeli leaders before the end of October,
Clinton said, "There's been no discussion of that."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Dennis Ross, the senior U.S. mediator on the
Middle East, was holding separate meetings Thursday with Israeli
and Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Clinton met with Crown Prince Abdullah of
Saudi Arabia and told him that oil prices are "too high" and urged
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to take
appropriate action.
</P>
<P>
"I told him that I was very concerned that the price of oil was
too high, not just for America but for the world, that if it was
to cause a recession in any part of the world that would hurt the
oil-producing countries," Clinton said during a picture-taking
session with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met Abdullah on Wednesday night at his hotel in
downtown New York. He said he urged OPEC to take "appropriate
action" at its upcoming meeting along the lines of a previous
commitment to increase output to bring down the price of oil.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Music Brings Sensation to Midwest Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York, September 7 (Xinhua) -- "Chinese music is haunting."
said Cathylin, an English teacher in St. Louis after watching a
Chinese traditional concert on September 3 evening.
</P>
<P>
The concert, part of the Chinese Culture Exchange tour in the
United States, was presented by the China National Traditional
Orchestra at the Powell Symphony Hall in St. Louis, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
"It's marvelous," said St. Louis Mayor Harmond. Before the
concert started, he delivered a passionate speech, announcing "
September 3, 2000 is the Chinese national music day of the city of
St. Louis." "We will feel the power of serenity and beauty of the
nature embodied in Chinese music," added Harmond.
</P>
<P>
He was proud that for the first time an African-American
cultural organization took the lead in holding a Chinese concert
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Besides St. Louis, the China National Traditional Orchestra
presented concerts in three other Midwest cities: Des Moines, Iowa;
Chicago, Illinois; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Local audience were
thrilled at the Chinese concert brought to them.
</P>
<P>
"I got the news from The St. Louis Post and then bought two
tickets. I drove here from Springfield, Illinois, 100 miles away."
Cathy Darak said, her eyes sparkled with excitement. "It's so
wonderful, and the music is so beautiful."
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Darak had heard Butterfly lovers before, but never heard
such a grand concerto. She said she "can't help standing up and
yelling when her heart was touched by the music."
</P>
<P>
"I love Chinese music, it's so different and the instruments
are so unique." said Mr. Darak, her husband, who expressed his joy
with "Xie Xie" (thanks).
</P>
<P>
In Des Moines, the capital city of Iowa, Chinese musicians also
won lasting applause from the audience, 90 percent of which are
local Americans.
</P>
<P>
Danis Wendell, an associate professor of Iowa State University
and a Chinese culture lover, drove 40 minutes from Ames, Iowa, to
Des Moines on August 29 to watch the Chinese concert.
</P>
<P>
"I was moved to tears when I heard so many beautiful and
familiar musical pieces, and especially when I heard the Chinese
musicians play 'America the beautiful' with their traditional
musical instruments. They played even better than Americans," said
Wendell.
</P>
<P>
Harry Poffenbarger, a retired computer engineer in Chicago said
he had been looking forward to the Chinese musicians since he got
news from a local newspaper that a Chinese Concert would be
presented in Chicago on August 31.
</P>
<P>
"The concert was excellent, and I like the erhu soloist the
best." said Poffenbarger, who became interested in Chinese music
after he listened to a program on Chinese music at Northwestern
University 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I was glad to see Chinese music can be accepted by so many
Americans. It means that Chinese musical instruments are
expressive." said Chen Xieyang, conductor of the orchestra before
leaving for New York, where he and his orchestra will present two
concerts on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
The orchestra will conclude their U.S. tour in San Francisco on
September 10 and then leave for China.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland to Introduce Full E-Government in Four Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A limited number of electronic services will come into
operation next year, according to local reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to enable citizens to get information from the
authorities over the Internet rather than over an office counter
or via conventional mail or telephone.
</P>
<P>
Plans are also in place to introduce voting by electronic means.
The government said it would present a white paper for
consultations later this year.
</P>
<P>
"E-voting" is seen as a way to facilitate political
participation, notably for Swiss citizens living abroad. There are
currently around 580,000 Swiss expatriates but less than 20
percent have registered as voters.
</P>
<P>
In an official statement on "E-voting" issued on Wednesday, the
government said that the introduction of voting by electronic mail
raised a series of political, legal and technical problems. Two
committees have been set up in July to examine the proposals.

At an urgent meeting called after the incident occurred

<HEADLINE> Protests Against Fuel Price Rise Escalate in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The protest against fuel price
rise by truckers, farmers and taxi drivers is escalating in France
as two national railway services were interrupted on Thursday with
many road blockades set up by protesters.
</P>
<P>
The railway service between Paris and the eastern city of
Strasbourg was interrupted Thursday morning due to blockade by
farmers, said the state railway company SNCF.
</P>
<P>
The high-speed bullet train between the southwestern city of
Bordeaux and the south-central city of Toulouse was also stopped
for the better part of the day by farmers who set up blocks on the
railway track.
</P>
<P>
In the western region of Brittany, protesters blocked roads
around several cities, while farmers and truckers set up blockades
on the French-Belgian border to prevent trucks transporting fuel
from entering France.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission Thursday issued a warning against the
French government calling for the guarantee of free traffic and
free circulation of merchandises in Europe which is being
threatened by the blockades.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 100 oil storehouses and refineries are still
being blocked by truckers, resulting in a nationwide shortage of
oil supply.
</P>
<P>
French Interior Minister Daniel Vaillant said the moment has
come for the protesters to lift the blockades as the French people
cannot live in a state of siege indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The French Defense Ministry said that there is "tension" on the
oil stocks of the armed forces although "all the operational
priorities are preserved" for the time being.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Ready to Back Regional Development: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Post-Cold War developments in
the Caucasus, Central Asia and Balkan that border Turkey have
brought a new vision to Ankara's foreign policy, Turkish State
Minister Abdulhaluk Cay said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cay made the remark in meeting with Donald Johnston, secretary
general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development(OECD), Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Johnston arrived in Istanbul, Turkish biggest city, Wednesday to
attend a conference on the regional development hosted by the
Istanbul Development of Private Sector Center (IDPS).
</P>
<P>
Cay said that Turkey is located as a bridge between Europe and
Asia, the Caspian and Mediterranean basins and the unique geography
offers a natural opportunity to develop various regional economic
relations.
</P>
<P>
"The representatives and policy-makers from the private sector
who participate in the activities at the Istanbul Development of
Private Sector Center, have an opportunity to get to know each
other's systems and economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said it is important for these countries in the Balkan,
Central Asia and Caucasus to strengthen their independence,
mobilize their economic resources, integrate themselves with global
economy to realize prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was willing to help these countries in their efforts to
the development process, he said.
</P>
<P>
He made an introduction of the activities of Turkish Cooperation
and Development Agency (TIKA), saying that the development of the
private sector in the regions would offer new business
opportunities to businessmen.
</P>
<P>
He said that the IDPS has become "an important international
platform" capable of providing information about the economic
activities in the regions through the help of international
organizations such as the OECD.
</P>
<P>
Cay asked Johnston to give more participation right to Turkish
educators in the OECD's programs, and to help the coordination of
TIKA and OECD in determining the participants and the countries
which are offered service.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the OECD to give Turkey more service at a
lower cost and focus more on studies aimed at finding out the needs
of the countries in the regions.
</P>
<P>
Johnston hailed the center in Istanbul as playing a vital role
in providing support for the development of the countries in the
region, saying that Turkey's support for the OECD was very
important.
</P>
<P>
"It is significant that the center is located in Turkey and it
shares its activities with the countries in the regions," urging
the center to increase activities in promoting the regional
development.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan President Extends Emergency in Run-up to General Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has extended a nationwide state of emergency by a
month in the run-up to the October 10 general elections,
government officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the presidential proclamation on the state of
emergency has to be approved by the parliament which was dissolved
on August 18.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, President Kumaratunga directed the secretary-
general of the parliament to convene a day-long special session of
the parliament on September 14 to seek its approval on the
president's decision, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
During the session, the government will move a resolution
seeking the extension of emergency in the country, an exercise
undertaken every month for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The parliament would dissolve again after the special session,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The emergency regulations lend wide ranging powers to the
police and armed forces to arrest and detain suspected Tamil Tiger
rebels who are fighting for a separate state for minority Tamils
in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The emergency, which was first imposed in May 1983, has
continuously been used by each successive government, sometimes in
certain areas and at other times to include the entire nation.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in Nepal Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Nepal
continue to decline even after the resumption of India Airlines
flights to the country on June 1 this year, according to Tribhuvan
International Airport Immigration Office.
</P>
<P>
The data by the immigration office, available on Thursday,
reveals that tourist arrivals into the country in the first eight
months of this year has declined by 13.69 percent as compared to
the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The total number of tourists that visited Nepal via air till
the end of August stands at 215,000, while the number in the same
period last year was 249,000, the data said.
</P>
<P>
Tourists visiting Nepal through air constitute almost 86
percent of the total tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
The hijacking of an Indian Airlines passenger plane on December
24, 1999, en route from Kathmandu to New Delhi prompted the
airlines to suspend all the flights to Nepal for over five months,
which not only affected the number of Indian tourists to Nepal but
also affected tourist arrivals from other countries, as 20 percent
of them come via India.
</P>
<P>
The hijacking episode resulted in a fall of Indian tourist
arrivals by 35.49 percent in the first eight months of this year,
said the data. Indian tourists occupy about 35 percent of tourists
visiting Nepal.
</P>
<P>
However, Nepali tourism entrepreneurs believe that with more
international airlines increasing their flights to Nepal in the
recent months, the tourist arrivals are likely to rise in Winter,
which is the high season for traveling in Nepal.

<P>
"I have already sent a communication to all Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) expressing the concern of
India about the alarming rise in prices while requesting them to
take appropriate decisions to reduce prices in their meeting on
September 10," Indian Petroleum Minister Ram Naik was quoted as
saying by the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who left here late
Wednesday night for a 13-day visit to the United States, is also
likely to take up the issue with U.S. President Bill Clinton, the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
"Acting U.S. Ambassador A.A. Thibault met me today to share his
country's concern over the international oil prices ... he will
communicate mutual concerns to U.S. President," Naik noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the impact of high oil prices would be
significant for India, a major oil importer, but any decision to
raise domestic prices would be taken only after the OPEC meeting
in Vienna this weekend and the return of Vajpayee and Finance
Minister Yashwant Sinha from the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the PTI, Naik reminded the OPEC in his
communication that it had decided in its June meeting to maintain
the prices in the band of 22 to 28 dollars a barrel, which would
average 26 dollars.
</P>
<P>
India was expressing the feelings of the entire developing
countries, he added.

JOHANNESBURG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A man in his early 30s
broke into South African President Thabo Mbeki's official
residence in Cape Town sometime between September 1 and 4, the
South African Press Association reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki was in New York at the time of the incident.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, presidential spokeswoman Tasneem Carrim
confirmed that the man had not gained access to the president's
private quarters, but had consumed some of his food and drink.
</P>
<P>
There was also no serious damage to property, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Carrim, "the man has been arrested and is
presently in police custody awaiting further investigation and
action."
</P>
<P>
However, the statement was silent on how the man managed to
breach security, including police guards in the presidential
compound, especially in the light of the urban terror experienced
in Cape Town over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
It was also not clear how long he had made himself at home
before detection.
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time Mbeki has been victim of theft in Cape
Town, the report said, disclosing that in 1998, when Mbeki was
deputy president, a gardener at the same compound was caught
stealing some Zimbabwean copper chains from him.

<HEADLINE> Second Canadian Athlete Suspended in Doping Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Olympic team
blocked a second athlete from the up-coming Sydney Games Wednesday
night in another doping scandal.
</P>
<P>
Equestrian Eric Lamaze, a 32-year-old Toronto-area rider, was
suspended after random testing revealed evidence of cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty devastating to the team," said equestrian team
chef d'equipe Terrance Millar.
</P>
<P>
"We are all friends of Eric's and we feel a great sense of
sadness and 'what a waste.' He's a great talent and at the top of
his career," he said.
</P>
<P>
Test results from a second sample are expected from the
Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport Thursday morning for a final
decision on whether or not Lamaze will compete in Sydney. He has
10 days to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Lamaze tested positive for cocaine in 1996 and was handed a
four-year suspension, which was later shortened on appeal to seven
months. The rider has ever since insisted he has overcome his past
drug use.
</P>
<P>
Just a few days ago, Edmonton hammer thrower Robin Lyons tested
positive for an anabolic steroid.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old hammer thrower, who has launched an appeal of
the finding, said Wednesday that she had never touched a
performance-enhancing drug. She believes several legal dietary
supplements she has taken may have prompted the positive tests for
narandrosterone.

<HEADLINE> Girl's University Dream Comes True (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Today, the first day of the
autumn term for China's big-name Qinghua University, is really a
great day for Zhang Xiaoxiao, a first-year female student.
</P>
<P>
It is not only because her university dream has come true but
for the fact her dream is materialized with the help of basic life
insurance set up by the government and financial and material
assistance from others, mostly unknown to her.
</P>
<P>
Almost all her belongings, including clothing, shoes and
luggage, are donated by many strangers. "It is love and aid from
others that has helped me materialize my university dream," says
the 18-year girl, a native Beijinger.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is one of the three million beneficiaries of the poverty-
line security funds which originated in Shanghai, the most
developed city in east China, and has covered 667 cities and 1,639
county-seats.
</P>
<P>
Li Bengong, director of the disaster relief department of the
Ministry of Civil Affairs, divides the beneficiaries into four
categories -- residents without any stable income, working ability
or legal supporters; people with stable income but living under
the poverty line due to financial reasons; the unemployed who have
failed to find a new job; and those who live under the poverty
line and are eligible for receiving the assistance.
</P>
<P>
In China, poor people living in different places enjoy
subsidies of different amounts. In Shenzhen, where the local GDP
tops the country, financial aid to the needed is also the highest,
amounting to 319 yuan per month for each person.

<P>
But in low-income cities like Hohhot, Nanchang and Yinchuan,
the monthly bottom-line assistance stands at 143 yuan per person.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government of Beijing recently raised the monthly
poverty-line aid to 276 yuan, from 264 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's father died of sudden illness last year, leaving the
poor family in an even more miserable situation. She considered
dropping out from her high school until the neighborhood committee
in her residential area helped her apply for the then 264-yuan aid
for poor residents.
</P>
<P>
Her family was also granted a monthly food and edible oil
assistance worth 40 yuan by the local government.
</P>
<P>
Upon learning her success in the college entrance exam, local
officials came to help once again by raising 3,000 yuan for her to
cover schooling fares. They have even bought her suitcases and
warm clothing.
</P>
<P>
Another good news for Zhang and others like her is that the
state has initiated a program to grant credit loans to university
students from poor families.
</P>
<P>
"I owe so much to society," says the girl student, "I'm looking
forward to the day I can pay it back."

<HEADLINE> S. African President to Visit Nigeria for 40th Anniversary of Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki will be the guest of honor at the celebrations marking
Nigeria's 40th anniversary of independence, the South African
Press Association reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki will pay a three-day visit to the most populous African
country at the end of this month during which he will meet
President Olusegun Obasanjo and attend the October 1 Independence
Day celebrations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The visit -- the exact dates of which have yet to be announced -
-will be just the latest in a series of exchanges between the two
countries after an improvement in bilateral relations since the
military rule in Nigeria was ended last year.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had been a prominent supporter of the fight against
apartheid in South Africa before the latter achieved black
majority rule in 1994, but their relations remained strained under
the Nigerian regime of late military ruler Sani Abacha with the
South African government a leading critic of the regime.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have set up a joint trade commission since
Nigeria returned to civilian rule last May. They have also held
regular talks underlining their claims to a leadership role in the
continent.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges France to End Road Blockades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Thursday called on the French authorities to end road blockades on
grounds that the road obstacles are breaching the EU law of free
movement of people and goods.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Todd, spokesman for the commission that serves as the
executive body of the 15-nation European Union (EU), said that a
notification had been sent to the French authorities requiring an
answer to the problem within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
French farmers and truck drivers are setting up road blockades
in a protest against the ever-rising prices of fuels in their
country.
</P>
<P>
The French government has already cut down the tax levied on
the fuels. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
has been blamed for its tight production policy that has caused
the recent oil price hike.
</P>
<P>
Todd said the road blockades in France might lead to serious
outcome if the French authorities adopt no effective measures to
end the blockades.
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time that the French had set up road
blockades to protest against national authorities. Other EU member
states, especially those that border with France, are worried by
the act.
</P>
<P>
The rocketing of oil prices posted since early 1999 has
triggered a debate in the EU on the crude oil prices and the three
components of oil price, including refining, distribution and
taxation on oil products.
</P>
<P>
Vice President of the European Commission Loyola de Palacio
said the price hike was mainly due to the production restriction
policy of OPEC.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices now seemed determined to fluctuate within a
band of 30 U.S. dollars a barrel and it entered that band in
February following an uninterrupted rise since December 1998 when
the crude oil price bottomed out at 10 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Fadhil Chalabi, executive director of the Center for Global
Energy Studies, warned that "if OPEC does not increase its
production, prices will go very high until the peak of the winter.
Prices may even exceed 40 dollars a barrel."
</P>
<P>
OPEC, scheduled to meet over this weekend in Vienna, is
expected to approve an additional production of 500,000 barrels of
crude oil a day. Yet analysts said the production may not suffice
to meet the global demands.

<HEADLINE> EU Complains About Further Devaluation of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Thursday complained about the further devaluation of the euro,
which kept hitting record lows in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange rate does not reflect the real value of the euro
and contradicts with all the data concerning the EU growth in the
first six months of the year," said Gerassimos Thomas, an official
of the European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamentals of the EU economy are very good," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
When asked what the commission thought of German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's comment that had been blamed for the
devaluation of the euro against the U.S. dollar, Thomas said that
the commission would not comment on the remarks by national
politicians.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate and the economic fundamentals would be
discussed by EU finance ministers in their scheduled meeting in
France over the weekend, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU economy only partly relies on exportation, said Thomas
when asked to comment on the relation between the devaluation and
the increasing EU exports.
</P>
<P>
It was the domestic demand that had greatly boosted the
rekindled economy of the union, he said.
</P>
<P>
The credibility of the euro failed one more test on Wednesday
as traders simply abandoned it, pushing it toward new lows.
</P>
<P>
At one time the euro plunged to 86.85 cents against the dollar
and kept plunging on Thursday in early trading.
</P>
<P>
The single currency went as low as 86.35 cents against the
dollar on Thursday and there seemed to be no immediate brake to
stop the free-falling.
</P>
<P>
Critics said that the panic selling was fanned by the comments
from Schroeder. The German Chancellor said earlier this week that
he was not concerned about the euro's devaluation, that only helps
to make German exports cheaper overseas.
</P>
<P>
Fears that European policy-makers were at odds with the
European Central Bank spread from one exchange market to another
in that the European Central Bank had just raised its benchmark
lending interest rate by a quarter point.
</P>
<P>
Raising interest rates is usually a move that tends to bolster
local currency.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Clear Labeling of Eggs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Thursday called for compulsory and clear labeling of eggs about
the way they are produced so as to facilitate consumer choice.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers increasingly care about the way eggs are produced,"
said EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler.
</P>
<P>
The compulsory labeling scheme will replace the existing
voluntary labeling scheme.
</P>
<P>
The method by which hens are farmed has become a major factor
in how consumers choose which eggs to buy, said Fischler, adding
that the new labeling scheme will give consumers more right to
choose.
</P>
<P>
Under the new scheme, on eggs or packages will be clear
indication on how the hens are farmed and farming indicator will
appear in phrases such as "free range," "semi-intensive," "deep
litter," and "cage production."
</P>
<P>
Additional information is also encouraged to include the trader,
durability, storage method, origin, selling price, quality and
weight grading.
</P>
<P>
The compulsory labeling will also be applied to egg producers
from non-EU member countries.

</P>

</P>
<P>
-- Unveiling a book-length plan that hinges on optimistic
fiscal forecasts, U.S. Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday offered

<HEADLINE> Chinese Newspapers Keen on Environmental Protection Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese newspapers cover more
articles on environmental protection than before, according to a
survey released today by a non-governmental environmental
organization "Friends of Nature."
</P>
<P>
The organization surveyed 75 newspapers, which published 47,000
pieces of news stories on the environment in 1999, or two such
stories in one newspapers each day, compared with one story every
two days in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers devoted a large space to problems on wildlife
protection and air and water pollution last year. However, three
years ago, more environmental reporting was about tree planting,
sanitation and government-advocated environmental campaigns.
</P>
<P>
"Friends of Nature" started in 1994 to conduct the annual
survey and evaluation.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers with the organization said that newspapers play an
important role in improving public awareness on environmental
protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 7 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese central government
is happy to note that Hong Kong has so far cast off the negative

Hong Kong industrial and commercial circle participating the
upcoming fourth China Investment and Trade Fair, which is
scheduled in this special economic zone of east China's Fujian
Province from September 8-12.
</P>
<P>
Such a success of Hong Kong is achieved under the leadership of
the Hong Kong SAR government headed by Chief Executive Tung Chee-
Hwa and by sticking to the principle of one country, two systems,
Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong, and a high degree of
autonomy, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
She expressed gladness over meeting old friends again and
making acquaintances with new friends as well. She spoke highly of
Hong Kong's active participation to the economic development of
the mainland, expressing the hope that concerted efforts would
continue for the common prosperity of the country.

direct overseas funds, is sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, the Fujian Provincial People's
Government and the Xiamen City People's Government.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the fair is expected to combine investment with trade,
presentation with negotiations, project promotion with policy
consultation, business activities with academic discussions.
</P>
<P>
She also voiced the hope that delegates present would take this
opportunity to learn more about the mainland so as to participate
more in its economic construction.

general of the World Trade Organization (WTO). She said that China
will support Supachai's work in the organization.
</P>
<P>
On the WTO, Wu said more demands of the developing countries
should be taken into consideration in the upcoming round of
multilateral talks.

tackled by other international organizations, Wu said.

entry into the WTO is almost over, adding that he believes China

surely play an important role in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He said the future WTO should be democratic, equal, and
transparent

<HEADLINE> Hang Seng Bank Launches Automated Banking Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Hang Seng Bank of Hong Kong
announced Thursday the launch of comprehensive automated banking
services to help companies manage their finances more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
The new services, as part of the efforts to enhance services to
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), allow business
customers to access their accounts and perform banking
transactions round-the-clock through phone banking and ATM
services.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Tsui, Hang Seng Bank's Assistant General Manager and
Head of Retail Sales and Services said off-counter transactions
made up 81.7 percent of total transactions at the end of June, an
increase of 11 percent from a year earlier, showing the popularity
of automated banking services among individual customers.
</P>
<P>
"The extension of such convenient services to business
customers is in line with our strategy to develop the SME sector,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The phone banking services allow designated company staff to
perform a wide range of banking transactions. These include
account balance inquiries, fund transfers to designated accounts,
gold price, interest and exchange rate inquiries, inquiries about
the status of issued and deposited cheques and inward remittances,
and cheque book and account statement requests.
</P>
<P>
Companies can also apply for up to three Hang Seng Cards to
enjoy convenient ATM services.
</P>
<P>
To meet the growing business needs of companies, Hang Seng Bank
has set up 11 business banking centers in major branches. A broad
range of products and services has also been launched, including
IT equipment financing, the profits tax loan, as well as trade
finance services.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1933, Hang Seng Bank, a principal member of the
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) Group, is the
second-largest locally-incorporated bank in Hong Kong and operates

<HEADLINE> Israeli Acting FM Urges Barak, Arafat to Make Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel's acting Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami Thursday urged Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to make final decisions on an
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Israel Radio after reports from New York earlier
Thursday showed that U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to break
the deadlock in the peace process, Ben-Ami said "This is no longer
time for negotiations, it's a time for decisions by leaders."
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat are both in New York to attend the United
Nations Millennium Summit. They met Clinton separately, the first
meetings since their summit at Camp David last July ended without
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The bottleneck issue is the fate of Jerusalem, which Israel
claims as its "eternal and undivided capital," while the
Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of their
future state. Israel occupied the eastern part in the 1967 Mideast
War.
</P>
<P>
During and after the Camp David summit, various solutions on the
issue had been raised by U.S., Egyptian and European leaders. But
reports said Arafat did not change his position on the issue while
meeting with Clinton late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart announced that Clinton had
failed in his attempt to bring about a breakthrough in the stalled
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also reported no intention of holding another Camp David
three-way summit, which was widely expected as the last chance to
revive the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami stressed Thursday that Israel had "reached its red
lines" during the Camp David summit, and the negotiations will not
be endless.
</P>
<P>
"We are not hostages and cannot allow ourselves to be hostages.
The government is working in different directions at the same time.
We have a deadline for negotiations," he said, referring to Barak's
plan to set up a broad-based coalition with the major opposition
Likud party in case that a deal with the Palestinians could not be
reached.
</P>
<P>
Such a coalition, which will help Barak restore his
parliamentary majority ahead of the parliament's re-convening at
the end of October, will surely harm the peace process, as Likud
had expressed its objection to making further compromises to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Gilad Sher, who is one of Israeli major negotiators
along with Ben-Ami in the past few months, also told Israel Radio
Thursday that in his opinion, Israel had reached the limit of its
flexibility on the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He added that Arafat should understand that there are only a few
weeks left for the talks, and at the end of that the windows of
opportunities will be shut.
</P>
<P>
He urged Arafat to show more flexibility and openness so as not
to miss the historic chance to end the century-long conflicts
between Jews and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
An official in Barak's delegation to New York had confirmed
Thursday to Israel Radio that the prime minister had set October 6
as the deadline for the Israeli-Palestinian talks. Barak said that
if there is still no progress in the talks, the peace process will
be derailed for a long time.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congress is due to dissolve on that date and the Americans
will be busy with new presidential elections, scheduled for
November. Israel's Yom Kippur, the most solemn day of the Jewish
calendar, also falls on that day.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Leader Granted Bail in Corruption Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A metropolitan session court
Thursday granted bail to the opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia
in a corruption case when she appeared in the court Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader and former Finance
Minister Saifur Rahman and former Civil Aviation and Tourism
minister Abdul Mannan accused in the case were also granted bail.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda Zia and nine others were prosecuted by the Bureau of
Anti-Corruption for alleged misappropriation of 1.75 billion taka
(34.8 million U.S. dollars) in purchasing two Airbuses from France
in 1994 during the BNP rule. The case was filed on August 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The BNP chief has also been accused in another corruption case
involving nearly 120,000 dollars for decorating her Dhaka Garrison
residence while she was in power from 1991 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Moving the bail petition, Barrister Maudud Ahmed said the case
against the opposition leader was baseless and preposterous. It
was motivated and intended politically to harass Begum Zia and
other leaders of BNP and tarnish their image and reputation.
</P>
<P>
He argued that people were aware that the case was fictitious
and this kind of false case would not cause any damage to the
United Movement of the opposition. Rather it would strengthen the
stand of the opposition that the government does not believe in
rule of law, he added.
</P>
<P>
Opposing the bail, Public Prosecutor Kamrul Islam submitted
that the accused influential persons, if enlarged on bail, could
mislead the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hearing of a petition filed under section 205
seeking exemption of Begum Zia from personal appearance in the
court was also held Thursday but the court gave no order.

<HEADLINE> Turkmenistan Becomes ADB's 59th Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Thursday that Turkmenistan, a central Asian country, has
become its 59th member, a decision effective on August 31 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based multilateral financial body said in a news
release issued here that it will soon send an economic mission to
Turkmenistan to help decide how it can best assist its newest
member.
</P>
<P>
ADB, which seeks to reduce poverty in Asia, expects to focus on
giving the poor better access to income-generating opportunities
and to basic social services in the country. ADB will also support
the government in reforming the economy.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said state-owned enterprises in Turkmenistan still
comprise 90 percent of the country's economy, which is undergoing
transition from a command to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADB, the country's economy is mainly dependent
on the production of primary goods, especially natural gas, oil
and cotton.
</P>
<P>
However, it added, Turkmenistan is heavily dependent on food
imports. Textiles and hydrocarbon processing dominate the
industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan became independent from the former Soviet Union in
October 1991 and is the fourth largest territory among the former
Soviet states.

<HEADLINE> Stage Set for American Hostage's Release Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine government
negotiator said Thursday that the stage has been set for the
holding of formal negotiations for the freedom of the 24-year-old
American Jeffrey Schilling who has been kidnapped by the Abu
Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Sulu Vice-Governor Munib Estino, the appointed Philippine
government negotiator, told local reporters in Jolo, capital of
the southern Philippine island province of Sulu, that he has sent
an emissary to the Abu Sayyaf's lair in Paikul town Thursday
morning with pen, paper and a video camera to record the formal
demands of the terrorists in exchange for the safe release of
Schilling.
</P>
<P>
Estino said that as soon as the emissary returns to Jolo, he
will immediately transmit the demands or any statements from the
kidnappers or from Schilling to the government for their proper
action.
</P>
<P>
Estino said he was informed that Schilling is in good physical
condition but that the American is given to tantrums, especially
when he is moved from one place to another.
</P>
<P>
The negotiator also appealed to all agencies or persons who
bring any medicines, foodstuff, or other goods to Schilling or who
contact the Abu Sayyaf holding him to coordinate with him to
prevent any complications that could prejudice his effort to
obtain Schilling's early and safe release.
</P>
<P>
Estino categorically refuted the Abu Sayyaf's claim that
Schilling is a member of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
or that he is a gunrunner.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed previous reports that Schilling was indeed
invited by the Abu Sayyaf to visit them in Jolo so he could meet
some of the relatives of his wife, Ivy Osani. Osani is said to be
a relative of a Abu Sayyaf's leader.
</P>
<P>
Estino said Schilling went to Jolo voluntarily on August 28 but
has been forcibly detained by the terrorists since then.

<HEADLINE> 11 Nigerian Products to Enjoy U.S. Duty-Free Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- About 11 products from Nigeria
will qualify for duty-free status into the United States under the
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) recently announced by
President Bill Clinton during his visit to the west African
country, The Punch newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a statement from the U.S. Embassy in the
capital Abuja as saying that these include electrical, electronic,
leather, plastic, rubber and metal and textile products.
</P>
<P>
According to the duty-free program, Nigeria would be allowed to
diversify its oil-dominated export base, such as sports equipment
and materials, biscuits and confectioneries, paper materials and
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day state visit to Nigeria in late August,
Clinton announced that the west African country would be included
among the beneficiaries of the GSP in a bid to deepen the economic
partnership between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that more than 4,650 products from about 140
countries worldwide enjoy American GSP status, which provides non-
reciprocal tariff preferences for products from the developing
countries into the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which imported Nigeria's agricultural and
textile products worth 14 million U.S. dollars in 1998, is the
major export market of the west African country, accounting for 44
percent of its total export.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Government Wants National Vote on Swisscom Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government is calling
for a nationwide referendum on the privatization of
telecommunications operator Swisscom, and the creation of a post
office bank, the Swiss Radio International reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government hoped that the decision will prevent lengthy
political and legal wrangling.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts argue that it would be unconstitutional for the
government to give up its majority share in Swisscom or introduce
postal banking services without the approval of the Swiss people
and cantons.
</P>
<P>
However, the government said a parliamentary debate on whether
the move was in line with the constitution would only delay
implementation of its plans, which, it said, needed to be
introduced "urgently."
</P>
<P>
It is expected that selling its shares in Swisscom will leave
the company better placed to form business alliances abroad, and
will also provide the money for creating a post office bank.
</P>
<P>
The government decision has preempted moves by trade unions and
one of the country's leading political parties to call for
referendums of their own.

BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Liu Ruixiang, director of the
Beijing Fire Control Administration, said today 28 percent of fire
accidents in the city last year were due to electrical problems.
</P>
<P>
Liu said old power grids, defects in electrical design, and
residents' improper use of electricity have been the main causes
for fires. Fire accidents caused by electricity last year numbered
over 1,350, and in the first half of this year over 700, or 26.8
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Liu said it is high time to publicize information on the
correct use of electricity and to intensify government control in
electricity.
</P>
<P>
Specialists are required to be certified to use electric
facilities and machinery involved in construction and decoration.
Routine tests will be given on the implementation of related laws
and regulations involving the use of electricity and preventing
electrical fires.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Higher People's
Court today turned down Li Ping's appeal and maintaining the
Beijing Intermediate People's Court's sentence.
</P>
<P>
Li, the mistress of Cheng Kejie, former vice-chairman of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee and chairman of the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region who was sentenced to death for
taking huge bribes, is charged of colluding with Cheng in taking
bribes and collaborating with other people in smuggling cases.
</P>
<P>
On August 9, the intermediate court granted Li a life penalty,
plus the confiscation of her personal properties worth 26.88
million HK dollars (one U.S. dollar equals 7.8 HK dollars) and a
fine of 400,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The intermediate court has made the conviction based on
evidence provided by the public persecutor and Li's own confession.
</P>
<P>
In their criminal collaboration, Li took the charge of "looking
for" business opportunities, while the former Guangxi leader was
responsible for settling the deal by using his political power.
Once the deal was made, Li would keep the profits.
</P>
<P>
The intermediate court has thus regarded Li as a main offender.
The court found that both Li and Zhang Jinghai, a Hong Kong
businessman, were playing an equal role in smuggling duty-free
cars.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the higher court rejected an appeal from the Hong
Kong businessman, for collaborating with Li in the smuggling of
other goods.

XI'AN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The world's only brown and white-
colored giant panda raised in a zoo, Dan Dan, died today in Xi'an,
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old female giant panda, equivalent to a woman in
her 80's, suffered from bad health and cataracts in recent years,
a zoo staff said. This May, the aging panda was diagnosed with
cellular cancer.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists from Xi'an Zoo and experts from the No. 4 Medical
College of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have tried every
effort to prolong the life of the panda.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation of Dan Dan deteriorated on September 1.
The panda twitched and could not eat and stand. It then underwent
a CT examination in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Doctors injected nutrient solution to the comatose panda, but
failed to save its life.
</P>
<P>
Dan Dan was discovered in Foping County, Shaanxi, 15 years ago,
and was sent to Xi'an Zoo. It gave birth to a male black and white-
colored panda in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists from the Research Center for Giant Panda Breeding in
Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, took
samples of skin, internal organs and germ cells from the dead
panda for genetic research.

<HEADLINE> West Nile Virus Spreads in Israel, Kills 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSAELM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Two elderly people infected
with the West Nile virus died Wednesday night in hospital at Kfar
Saba, in the central part of Israel, bringing to six the number of
people who died of the virus in the past year.
</P>
<P>
West Nile virus, transmitted to humans after they are bitten by
an infected mosquito, can in some instances lead to encephalitis, a
dangerous swelling of the brain.
</P>
<P>
Older people and those with weakened immune systems run the
highest risk of developing severe illness from the disease whose
symptoms resemble severe flu, with fever often accompanied by poor
muscle control or mental disorientation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Health Ministry officials confirmed on Thursday that
four other people have died from the disease this summer. And two
others have been hospitalized after being diagnosed with the virus
and they are in a critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The ministry disclosed that 40 people have been infected with
the virus, which is commonly found in Africa, Eastern Europe, West
Asia, and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Addressing fears of an epidemic, particularly in the central
part of the country, the ministry termed the fatality as a "
seasonal outbreak" of the virus which is endemic in this part of
the world.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays there is a greater awareness of the virus and therefore
it is more clearly diagnosed than in previous years, a ministry
official said.
</P>
<P>
This year's outbreak was first detected two weeks ago when the
virus manifested itself in 23 birds out of 25 in a nature reserve
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The virus is transmitted through mosquitoes that have bitten
migrating birds infected with the disease.
</P>
<P>
Three months ago the Israeli health, agriculture, and
environment ministries initiated a joint watch program intended to
prevent the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Ministry is now taking steps to spray areas
where there is a danger of mosquitoes.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Oppose Israeli Control of Islamic Sites in Jerusalem: Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has reiterated that the Arab people will never accept Israeli
control of Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem and that this unanimity
will not be compromised, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs are opposed to Israeli sovereignty over religious
symbols in Jerusalem, especially Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third
holiest site, and this position was not open for negotiation,
Mubarak told Samir Ragab, editor-in-chief of Al-Gomhuria daily, in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the Arab people categorically reject any sort
of concessions on the religious symbols of Islam in Jerusalem, holy
to Muslims, Jews and Christians.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader stressed that the issue of Jerusalem is "
very sensitive and must be dealt with carefully to avoid potential
setbacks" in the peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been stuck over Jerusalem. Israel occupied
East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and later declared the whole
city its "eternal and indivisible capital," a claim never
recognized internationally. The Palestinians want the eastern
sector of the city as the capital of their future independent
state.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak called on Israel to seize opportunity and hammer out a
peace agreement with the Palestinians to put an end to the 52-year-
long conflict in the Middle East.

Since European occupation 200 years ago, Australia has lost

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Parliament Regrets Over Atambua Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representative expressed here Thursday its regret over the Atambua
incident during which three staff members of the U.N.High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were killed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the parliament Akbar Tandjung told reporters that
the Indonesian government and the Indonesian Military (TNI) were
not responsible for the bloody incident.
</P>
<P>
"The government and the military have nothing to do with the
incident. The incident took place, as East Timorese were involved
in their own conflict. That is their own business, not our
government or military's (business). We have nothing to do with
that," Tandjung told reporters at the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, at least three staff members of the
UNHCR were killed when an angry mob of pro-Jakarta East Timorese
or so-called militia launched an armed attack on the
representative office of the UNHCR in Atambua, a city in Indonesia
's East Nusa Tenggara Province.
</P>
<P>
Separately, in an interview with Xinhua, Chairman Yasril Ananta
Baharuddin of the House Commission I on security and foreign
affairs said his commission regretted the incident and expressed
its condolences to the UNHCR over the loss of its staff members.
</P>
<P>
He further indicated that there might be political conspiracy
behind the incident which in fact coincided with the U.N.Millenium
Summit in New York.
</P>
<P>
"The incident was questionable. Why such an incident took place
and coincided with the U.N. summit? I suggest that there is
political conspiracy made by both nationals and foreigners, which
is aimed at discrediting the administration of President
Abdurrahman Wahid," he said.
</P>
<P>
He further asked the government to launch a comprehensive
investigation into the incident. "We urge the government to launch
an investigation and bring those who were responsible to the court.
"
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Antara reported from New York that Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid has conveyed his deep condolences to
the U.N.secretary-general over the death of three UNHCR staff
members, saying he has instructed Commander of the TNI Adm. Widodo
to carry out a thorough investigation into the incident.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Considers Tax Break for Venture Capital Fund Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Thursday
that it is considering giving a tax break to companies that start
venture capital (VC) funds.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury is deliberating on the tax break proposal,
Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz
said Thursday,hoping a decision would be made during the tabling
of the country's budget next month.
</P>
<P>
Large corporations especially those in the electronics sector
are the best candidates to formulate the VC funds, which are used
to promote information technology (IT) start-ups, Rafidah said at
the sidelines of the three-day MSC (Multimedia Super Corridor)
International Advisory Panel (IAP) meeting which opened in
Cyberjaya near here earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
She said the formulation of VC funds among companies was
emphasized during the open discussions between IAP members and
representatives at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
She said VC funds could be channeled to the small start-ups
involved in multimedia, electronics and other IT-related fields so
that they need not be heavily-dependent on banks for funds but
could look to the VC funds by large corporations which are much
more effective for their type of business.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IAP member Gilbert Amelio, who is the chief
executive officer of Beneventure Capital, told reporters also at
the sidelines of the meeting that Malaysia's infant VC industry
and technopreneurship would get a jump-start if its VC companies
could form partnerships with VCs from other countries.
</P>
<P>
The partnerships would enable the creation of infrastructure,
knowledge and momentum to develop the VC industry, Amelio said.
</P>
<P>
The MSC launched in 1996 is a 50 square kilometers by 15 square
kilometers zone, stretching from Kuala Lumpur southwards,
designated as a hub for the development of multimedia products and
services.

<HEADLINE> No Hurdle on Pak Side to Iran-India Gas Pipeline: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Petroleum
Minister Unsman Aminuddin said here Thursday that there is no
hurdle from Pakistan's side to the construction of the gas
pipeline between Iran and India.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Middle East Broadcasting Corporation,
he said Pakistan had responded positively to the request of the
Iranian government for the gas pipeline and shown its willingness
to remove the security concerns expressed by the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
The 2,670-kilometer pipeline from Iran to India via Pakistan is
expected to bring around 700 million U.S dollars in revenue per
annum to Pakistan. Meanwhile, as the only way for India to get gas
facility from Iran, Pakistan will reap a transit fee from the
pipeline project worth 500 million dollars annually while another
amount of 200 million dollars will be saved per annum by getting
cheaper gas from the project.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fire Threatens Queensland State of Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Forest fire is threatening
Queensland state of Australia because of lack of rain.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Associated Press, the state's
Emergency Services Minister Stephen Robertson warned Thursday that
almost all of Queensland was tinder dry and ready to explode into
damaging bushfires.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Queensland Fire and Rescue Authority's
emergency bushfire headquarters, the state minister said, "The
fire situation is very serious and 95 percent of the state is a
ticking firebomb ready to explode."
</P>
<P>
During the past three weeks, the state's southeast corner
reportedly saw thousands of fires, which were described as the
worst since 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, at least 80 to 90 percent of the
fires have been deliberately lit.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
A total of 50,000 permanent and volunteer firefighters were on
full alert while parents were asked to ensure that their children
were not deliberately lighting fires.
</P>
<P>
Anyone convicted of deliberately lighting a bushfire faces up
to seven years in jail or a fine of 35,000 Australian dollars (19,
775 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> WB Satisfied With Tanzania's Good Implementation of Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has
praised Tanzania for its impressive performance in the bank
supported projects during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Some 95 percent of the country's portfolio of projects financed
by the World Bank was rated satisfactory, up from 76 percent in
fiscal year 1997, according to a statement jointly issued here
Thursday by the bank and the Tanzanian Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Projects at risk in the portfolio declined from 52 percent in
1997 to 5 percent in fiscal year 2000, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that Tanzania has achieved impressive
performance in its portfolio during the past two years, not only
within the Africa region but also relative to the performance of
countries elsewhere," the World Bank Country Director for Tanzania
and Uganda Jim Adams said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The impressive improvement of the Tanzanian portfolio may be
ascribed, among other reasons, to a number of good practices in
portfolio management adopted by both the government and the bank
in the past two years, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The practices include closer collaboration between Tanzania
Country Office of the World Bank and the government's counterpart
officials in resolving policy and implementation issues.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement also warned that there are many new
challenges that need to be addressed over the next two years if
Tanzania continues to maintain its strong performance.
</P>
<P>
These include preparing Annual Work Plans in time, addressing
the shortage of counterpart funds from the Tanzanian government
and learning incorporation lessons from the past implementation
experience to the current portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government and the World Bank ended a two-day
meeting on Wednesday for a detailed review of the performance of
Tanzania's portfolio projects.
</P>
<P>
The biennial meeting is part of the World Bank's institutional
system of monitoring and assessing outcomes and impacts of its
various interventions.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has sought to actively support Tanzania's
economic recovery efforts as evidenced by some 131 Bank financed
projects, among which 110 have been completed since 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The portfolio comprises 23 projects with total commitments of
about 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. The bank is presently working on
four to five projects a year across most major sectors, but with a
growing emphasis on social sector programs which cover health,
education and capacity building.

<HEADLINE> International Olympic Committee to Add 200 EPO Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee Thursday said it would add up to 200 tests for the drug
EPO as doping scandals threatened to overshadow the run-up to the
Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The IOC originally planned only 301 tests for stamina-boosting
erythropoietin.
</P>
<P>
"If the first batch of 301 tests goes well, then we will make a
second batch of 100-200 tests," IOC medical commission member
Patrick Schamasch said.
</P>
<P>
The decision came a day after China said it had dropped 27
athletes from its Olympic team, including some for "suspicious"
test results.
</P>
<P>
An official from Uzbekistan's Olympic team was caught at Sydney
Airport on Thursday trying to bring in human growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
The IOC was applauded last month for approving a combined blood-
urine test for EPO in time for the Sydney Games on September 15.
</P>
<P>
The IOC began the tests, developed by Australian and French
laboratories, a day after the athletes' village opened on
September 2.
</P>
<P>
Schamasch said that around 20 tests had been conducted by
Thursday and the first results were expected soon.
</P>
<P>
He said the tests were mostly random although special attention
was paid to endurance athletes such as cyclists, long-distance
runners and swimmers.
</P>
<P>
"We are focusing mainly on endurance sports," Schamasch said.
</P>
<P>
EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells which carry
oxygen around the body. It is produced naturally but if it enters
the body artificially it can be fatal, making the blood thick and
gluey and breaking down the entire circulatory system.
</P>
<P>
Schamasch said scientists at a doping laboratory in Beijing had
told the IOC that they had conducted their own stringent tests but
said only seven were confirmed as having returned positive tests.

Speaking highly of the troupe's artistic creations, he said it
displays the stalwart will of the Chinese people in their constant
struggle, and reflects the staunch perseverance of handicapped

Jiang urges all of humankind to join forces in advocating this
kind of aspiration and spirit to bravely create a beautiful life.

<P>
Earlier, U.S. President Bill Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore
wrote letters to welcome the visit by Chinese handicapped artists.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Clinton says, "The performing arts have the
power to evoke in each of us a deeper understanding of our lives
and of the world around us. They encourage independence, enhance
our sense of self-worth, and provide an avenue for all people to
learn and develop creative talents and skills.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps most important," says Clinton, "the arts give use the
power to transcend barriers of language, culture, race, and
disability, allowing us to understand and appreciate humankind's
diversity as well as the goals and values we share."
</P>
<P>
Clinton thanked all those participating in the troupe for their
role in building bridges of understanding among the people's of
the world and in strengthening the depth and breadth of U.S.-China
relations.
</P>
<P>
"Best wishes for a wonderful visit to the United States," he
says.
</P>
<P>
In a separate letter, Gore says, "Tipper and I take great
pleasure in welcoming the China Disabled Person's Federation to
the United States. The federation's performers dramatically
illustrate the creative potential that lies at the heart of every
human being -- regardless of nationality or physical challenge."
</P>
<P>
Gore goes on to say, "These performers share a tremendous human
spirit. Their artistry has brought hope to fellow countrymen and
lent momentum to the Special Olympics movement in China. Their
determination has inspired millions at home and now promises to do
the same here in the United States."
</P>
<P>
"Please accept our heartfelt welcome and best wishes for a
successful series of performances," Gore says.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Refutes U.S. Accusation Concerning Religious Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam Thursday criticized the
United States for interfering in the internal affairs of other
countries, saying the United States has no right to judge the
religious situation in other nations.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese law stipulates and the state of Vietnam guarantees
that all the country's citizens enjoy the right to freely practice
a religion or not to practice a religion, spokesman of the
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Le Dung said at a press conference
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were in response to a question on Vietnam's
reaction to a report on religious freedom issued by the U.S. State
Department on September 5. The report warned against religious
repression in a number of countries in the Middle East and Asia,
including Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Dung said the right is contained in the Vietnamese Constitution
and respected in reality.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman affirmed that there is no such thing as the state
of Vietnam represses or hinders religious activities.
</P>
<P>
In a country with many religions and beliefs, Vietnamese
citizens, whether adhering to a religion or not adhering to a
religion, have equal rights before the law.
</P>
<P>
He said that in Vietnam, religious activities which serve
legitimate and lawful interests of religious adherents are secured.
Religious activities which serve the fatherland and people's
interests are encouraged.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused the United States of delegating itself a
right to judge the religious situation in other countries, saying
this is contrary to the fundamental principles of international
law and represents an interference in the internal affairs of
other countries.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Army's Strategic Intelligence Unit to Become Civilian Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Swiss President and Defense
Minister Adolf Ogi has announced that Switzerland's strategic
intelligence unit is to be taken out of the army's hands and
transformed into a civilian organization.
</P>
<P>
Ogi, quoted by Thursday's local press reports, said that the
change would take effect from 2001. But he said the army and air
force would retain their own intelligence units.
</P>
<P>
The new civilian body will remain affiliated to the defense
ministry, but will no longer be directly controlled by it, Ogi was
quoted as telling reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision follows a review of the unit's operations in the
wake of last year's fraud scandal. Making the strategic
intelligence unit a civilian body was one of the recommendations
of a report on the secret services, published last February.
</P>
<P>
The report was prompted by the Bellasi affair, named after the
former intelligence officer, Dino Bellasi, who was last year found
to have embezzled nine million Swiss francs (about five million U.
S. dollars) of Defense Ministry funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Lee Foundation Singapore today
donated one million Hong Kong dollars to China's forestation drive
in desertification-ridden areas.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yongguang, deputy director-general of China Youth
Development Foundation (CYDF), which is responsible for the drive,
said that this was the largest overseas donation ever received by
the foundation.
</P>
<P>
The man-made woodland, which is to cover 330 hectares, will be
situated in Huailai County, north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Forestation experts say the project will not only improve local
ecological conditions, but also help curb desert from invading
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Desertification in Huailai, adjacent to suburbs of Beijing,
creates many difficulties for the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
At the donation ceremony, Niu Maosheng, governor of Hebei, said
that his province will pour additional funds of nine million yuan
(1.1 million U.S. dollars) into the project.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Qiang, chairman of the CYDF, said that his foundation will
strictly supervise the project implementation and expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Together with a group of governmental bodies, the CYDF kicked
off the forestation drive in January 1999, enhancing the whole
society's consciousness of preventing pollution and safeguarding
environment in the country.
</P>
<P>
CYDF has received donations totaling 40 million yuan, funding
forestation in eight provinces, two autonomous regions and one
municipality alongside the Yellow River and the Yangtze River.

CANBERRA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar dropped
further Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was at 56.42 U.S. cents,
from 56.65 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The currency had fallen during the day to 55.95 U.S. cents, its
weakest point since August 28, 1998, and then rebounded sharply.
</P>
<P>
A bank currency strategist said trading was characterized by
nervous dealings and choppy movements.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard reportedly said Wednesday
that the reason for the Australian dollar's dive was a too strong
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was at 64.93 euro cents from
63.93 and at 60.02 yen from 59.92.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has opened an anti-
drugs exhibition center here to enhance public awareness about the
dangers of illicit drugs, according to a report from the Thai
government Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The center, inaugurated by Jurin Laksanavisit, minister of the
prime minister's office Wednesday, uses wax model, samples,
pictures and graphics to show the inside story of drug production
and transportation, the damage of drugs to the people and society
and the measures to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The most striking exhibit is a wax model showing a desperate
methamphetamine addict holding a child at knife point based on a
real criminal case in the capital city in which a drug addict
seized and murdered a toddler.
</P>
<P>
The center, which cost the Thai government 5 million baht (122,
000 U.S. dollars) to build, is part of the government's efforts to
deal with the worsening drug problem, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Thai authorities estimated that at least 600 million
amphetamine pills have been smuggled into the country since last
year. Meanwhile, more than 600,000 Thai teenagers are using
illegal drugs.

<HEADLINE> French Leader Thanks Estrada for Safe Hostages Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
thanked Philippine President Joseph Estrada for the safe release
of the French hostages who were among the foreigners held captive
in the southern Philippines by the Abu Sayyaf, an official said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno said in a press
briefing here that President Chirac, who met President Estrada in
New York before the opening of the U.N. Millennium Summit, also
expressed the hope that the Philippine government will succeed in
seeking the safe release of the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
Puno said that during the brief meeting between the two leaders,
the French president conveyed the gratitude of his country to the
Philippines in getting French woman Sonia Wendling and French
television reporter Maryse Burgot safely home.
</P>
<P>
Wendling and Burgot were among the foreigners set free by the
Abu Sayyaf after months of negotiations that involved Philippine
local and national officials, with the support of former Libyan
Ambassador Rajab Azzarou.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the remaining three French hostages -- Loisy Stephane
and TV crew members Jean Jacques Le Garrec and Roland Madura --
are set to be released Friday along with Seppo Franti and Risto
Vahannen from Finland and Marc Waller and Filipino Roland Ulla
from Germany.

<HEADLINE> Truckers Continue Blocking Oil Refineries in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- French truckers continued to
block oil refineries and storehouses and began blocking some
highways on Thursday, while taxi drivers were joining the protest
against the rise of fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
A total of 102 oil storehouses or refineries were blocked
Thursday morning while about 50 road blocks were set up on the
highways by truckers to stop traffic flows, said the National
Center of Road Information.
</P>
<P>
The traffic on the highways leading to the central city of Lyon
and the southwest city of Bordeaux were seriously disrupted by the
blockade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, taxi drivers tried to block the traffic to the
Mediterranean city of Montpellier by setting up blockades at four
axis which lead to the center of the city, according to Agence
France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
Two of the three national unions of truckers rejected on
Wednesday an offer by the government to cut fuel tax by 35
centimes (about five U.S. cents) per liter this year and 25
centimes (about 3.5 cents) next year.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot said on Thursday that
the government has done its maximum to end the crisis and it is
impossible for it to make more concessions.
</P>
<P>
The unrest which began on Monday has resulted in a serious
shortage of oil supply in France. And in more than half of the
country, oil sale at service stations is being rationed and many
stations are closed.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Border Trade Hustles and Bustles (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Increased scaffolds in the
downtown area, long queues at the customs, and billboards with
both Chinese and Russian advertisements are hallmarks of bustling
trade along the Heilongjiang, the boundary river between China and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Heihe City, the first frontier trade pass which
reopened Sino-Russian border trade in 1987 with a melon-for-
carbamide deal, have been busy preparing for trade talks between
Chinese and Russian businesses. They could hardly spare the time
to meet non-business people.
</P>
<P>
Decoration of the trade building is going on in the city,
construction of which was suspended a few years ago due to the
sluggish border trade.
</P>
<P>
Using simple Russian words they just learned, traders from east
China's Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province bargain with
business people who have come across the river.
</P>
<P>
In front of them, numerous "Made-in-China" commodities, from
instant noodles to game machines, are piled high on the small
island in the middle of the river.
</P>
<P>
The scene most frequently seen by outsiders in the Chinese
border city are tour guides showing around their guests with small
yellow flags held above their heads.
</P>
<P>
"We are much busier than before," said Fu Kejia, a 25-year-old
tour guide, "the number of people who wait to pay for a cross-
border visit has increased on both sides."
</P>
<P>
Everyday goods worth 1 million yuan (about 120,000 U.S. dollars)
are transported across the border in Heihe. Eight Chinese and
Russian passenger-cargo vessels, including the novel catamaran,
shuttle back and forth in the Heilongjiang River.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia, which share a 4,000-kilometer border, are
negotiating to build the first bridge across the river to enhance
bilateral trade.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Border Trade Hustles and Bustles (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sino-Russian border trade, with a history of more than 100
years, reached its climax in the early 1990s, shrinking all at
once in 1994 when many of the several thousand trade companies
withdrew from the area, blaming random marketing for the downfall.
</P>
<P>
The situation this year, however, has been improving as trade
along the Sino-Russian border markedly increased. Heilongjiang
Province's foreign trade with Russia grew by 78 percent during the
January-July period.
</P>
<P>
The light industry products Russians wants and raw materials
Chinese demand flow out and pour in incessantly. The bustling
scene was taken as a sign of the powerful recovery made in Sino-
Russian trade since last year, although it has yet to accomplish
the goal set by the top leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The mutual complement between China and Russia has been
visualized by the latest economic revival in Russia, the fast
growing economy in China, and the common strategic interests that
attract importance from both countries, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Chinese border cities have established direct financial
settlement relations with banks across the river to avoid possible
business risks which appeared in the early period, said Yu
Xiaodong, secretary of the Heihe City Committee of the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also endeavor to cultivate some large trade
companies with good credit and financial resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
The efforts made by China and Russia towards their accession to
the World Trade Organization are conducive to the maturity and
stabilization of bilateral trade relations, experts said.
</P>
<P>
"We are getting out of difficulties," said Yu. "The recovery of
the border trade is a symbolic of closer Sino-Russian economic
ties."

KUALA LUMPUR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Inspector-

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Import Sugar to Relieve Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Sugar Authority has
been allowed to import 10,000 tons of sugar every month to address
the current shortage, media here reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But, the authority will pay taxes and duty at 125 percent for
importing white mill sugar and the levies will be strictly
enforced to protect cane growers, Kenyan Agriculture Minister
Chris Obure said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Obure said the country was steeped in a sugar crisis and
available supply had gone down from 40,000 to 30,000 tons monthly.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will also review sugar sales to bulk
buyers to reduce chances of creating artificial shortage, adding "
there must be other underlying factors aggravating the situation
such as deliberate hoarding by unscrupulous traders with a view of
enriching themselves."
</P>
<P>
Apart from "selfish" traders hoarding sugar to make higher
profits, the minister also blamed the current drought for poor
sugarcane production.
</P>
<P>
He called for accelerating the sugarcane land development and
replantation, and taking strict surveillance at borders to prevent
sugar smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Since last month, Kenya has experienced a sugar shortage
nationwide and the price of sugar has gone up by some 30 percent
at supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
Sugar production between January and June this year reportedly
stood at 255,608 tons, compared with 218,779 tons during the same
period last year.

<HEADLINE> Concern Voiced Over Fires in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya National Chamber of
Commerce and Industry has expressed concern at the increased
incidents of fires with heavy economic losses.
</P>
<P>
A seven-hour inferno gutted Nairobi's largest open-air market
on early Wednesday. Last week, a fire destroyed another major open-
fire market in the downtown of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Kassim Owango, chairman of the chamber, urged the government on
Wednesday to investigate the causes of the two fires in which
traders have lost property worth billions of shillings (one U.S.
dollar is equal to 76 shillings).
</P>
<P>
The fires that razed the Freemarket last week and the Gikomba
market on Wednesday seemed to be an organized vendetta against
small-scale traders, Owango claimed.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the perpetrators are sought, arrested and charged, many
more people are going to suffer economic loss and become jobless,"
the East African Standard quoted Owango on Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The burning of the two markets will cause a major security risk
in the city, as most of the traders whose stalls were burned will
have no choice but to move to the expensive shop-dominated Central
Business District in Nairobi, Owango said.
</P>
<P>
He said fires were adding extra pain to Kenyans who are
suffering from the severe economic recession.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Intensifies Attacks on Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan army has
intensified attacks on the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in
the north, killing six and injuring dozens in the latest attack,
the New Vision daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The army had foiled the LRA rebel plan to raid Kitgum town
suburbs, and in the latest skirmishes, UPDF (the Uganda People's
Defense Forces) inflicted heavy injuries on the rebels," said
Richard Kiwanuka, a brigade commander of the UPDF.
</P>
<P>
Kiwanuka said the rebels were desperate and had turned their
anger on the civilians whom they accused of being hostile and
reporting them to the government forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that the LRA could not make major operations, adding
that the UPDF were not giving them breathing space.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted security sources as saying that the
Ugandan troops who launched the attack have been brought back
from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<HEADLINE> IMF Likely to Give More Fund to Kenya in Combating Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Thursday quoted Kenyan Finance
Permanent Secretary Martin Oduor-Otieno as saying the government
and the IMF/World Bank team which had been negotiating for nine
days here, agreed that the drought would "materially alter the
original budget."
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government made the request to the IMF team to
review the impact of drought on the country and to modify program
agreed to under the poverty reduction and growth facility.
</P>
<P>
"The drought will lead to a reduction in government revenue
and the overall economic growth prospects from those originally
set out," Oduor said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
A joint IMF/World Bank team visited Kenya beginning from August
25 and held successful discussions with the government officials
and other development partners on the impact of drought on various
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Oduor said the Kenyan government expected to incur more drought-
related expenditure in food relief, emergency water needs in the
capital Nairobi and other areas, power generation, agriculture,
health and education.
</P>
<P>
"We will now make presentations on the financing strategy and
resource gap in October to the IMF board for consideration," Oduor
added.

<HEADLINE> More Than 1,000 Correspondents to Cover Upcoming China Investment, Trade Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,200 Chinese and
foreign journalists have gathered in this east China city to cover
the forthcoming China Investment and Trade Fair scheduled for
September 8-12.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the event's organizing committee said that the
number of reporters rose by 70 percent over last year. The
correspondents come from China's mainland, Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan, southeast Asian countries, European countries, the United
States and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that a special website on the trade fair has
been launched on the Internet and the opening ceremony of the
event will be broadcast live worldwide through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
At present, the China Investment and Trade Fair is the only
national economic and trading activity in China which focuses on
luring foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Economist Yan Zheng attributed the increase in the number of
correspondents to the fact that the Chinese economy has made a
turn for the better. He also said China's soon-to-be-realized
accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the economic
situation in Asian countries, which have shed off the effect of
the Asian financial crisis, also shows a trend of going up.
</P>
<P>
Senior Chinese officials have expressed at the beginning of the
year that it is not a long way to go before China's accession into
the WTO. This means that China will open up more fields to foreign
investors. Moreover, the fact that the economies of southeast
Asian countries have begun to recover from the financial crisis
also means that more funds will flow into China.
</P>
<P>
China will issue a series of opening policies which include
encouraging foreign investors to pour money into high-tech
industries and central and western regions of China at the
upcoming trade fair, according to reliable sources.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China approved 11,891 foreign-
funded enterprises in the January-July period this year, an
increase of 26.93 percent over the same period last year.
Contracted foreign investment was 27.64 billion U.S. dollars,
rising 24.04 percent.
</P>
<P>
As of July this year, China has approved more than 353,700
overseas-funded enterprises, involving a combined contractual
foreign investment of 641.7 billion U.S. dollars. The used foreign
investment amounted to 327.7 billion U.S. dollars.

<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital of Beijing
has recently finished renovating a Catholic church in the downtown
commercial center of Wangfujing.
</P>
<P>
The St. Jausse Church, also named "Eastern Church" built in
1655 and occupying an area of 2,387 square meters, is the second
oldest Catholic church in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The local government started the renovation in May, and besides
the church itself, it also built a front square with a scope of 1.
2 hectares. Trees and grass were planted and various lighting
facilities were installed to show off the gorgeous building at
night.
</P>
<P>
The church opened to Catholics in 1980 after repair work was
done by the local government. The building, a combination of
ancient western and Chinese architectural styles, was damaged
three times.

<HEADLINE> China's Listed Companies Report Moderate Growth in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China's listed companies
reported moderate growth in the first half of the year, as a
result of an improving macroeconomic situation.
</P>
<P>
Interim reports of the 1,029 companies listed on the Shanghai
and Shenzhen bourses shows that their weighted average earnings
per share rose 6 percent to 0.11 yuan, compared to the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Sectors with closer links with the macroeconomy recorded better
performances. Listed companies in the iron and steel sector saw a
14-percent rise in their net profits, while those in the power
sector witnessed a 25-percent growth.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of 170 companies with an equity capital of more
than 400 million yuan each disclosed that their average net profit
increased 12 percent in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
Despite the improved performance in general term, 119 listed
companies reported losses in the first half of the year,
accounting for 11.56 percent of the total number of listed firms,
compared to 9.67 percent during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of August, listed companies raised 67 billion
yuan from the market through initial public offerings (IPOs),
placement of new shares and new issues.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the IPOs were in the field of chemicals, new
materials, infrastructure and information industries, while a bulk
of the funds from placement and new issues went to the upgrading
of traditional industries or high-tech departments such as
information technology, bioengineering, environmental protection
and new materials.

<HEADLINE> A Better Way to Convert Natural Gas Into Petrochemical Materials in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a more
efficient way to convert natural gas into petrochemical materials
using microwave catalyzing technology, opening up a new way to
better use natural gas resources.
</P>
<P>
The technology will increase the one-way C2 hydrocarbon yield
rate to 70 percent from 6 percent in using the traditional method,
while the highest yield rate in developed countries is 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
And by using the direct plasma conversion method under normal
or high air pressure, the one-way ethene yield rate has increased
25 percent, which was claimed the highest in the world by its
developers.
</P>
<P>
The technology was developed by a group of researchers headed
by Dr. Zhang Jinsong, a research fellow at the Metal Research
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), as one of the
key State-funded research programs between 1996-2000.
</P>
<P>
It is very complicated and expensive to convert natural gas
into commonly used petrochemical materials like ethene and ethyne
and scientists around the world are trying to find more efficient
ways to produce ethene and ethyne, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The new technique and related experimental facilities have
passed an appraisal by experts last month, which was organized by
the Ministry of Sciences and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the prospects are bright for the application of the
new technique, as the country's verified natural gas reserve has
been growing and more natural gas will be used by petrochemical
plants in China, particularly in the country's western region,
which has an abundance of natural gas.

<HEADLINE> New Auto Tail Gas Purifier Developed in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China has developed the world'
s first auto exhaust gas purifier using microwave catalyzing
technology, which is capable of rendering the purified exhaust gas
up to European standard EU2.
</P>
<P>
The purified exhaust gas is also very close to EU3, or the
next generation auto exhaust emission standard set by the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
The purifier was developed by a group of researchers headed by
Dr. Zhang Jinsong, a research fellow at the Institute of Metal
Research, under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), as one of
the key State-funded research programs between 1996-2000.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said they also developed another exhaust gas purifying
technique using an improved electric catalysis with similar
results.
</P>
<P>
He said the two techniques, already patented, could meet EU2
standards, which will be introduced in 2004 by China as its
standard for auto exhaust gas emission for the next generation.
</P>
<P>
"Commercializing the two techniques in China and application
by Chinese auto plants of the techniques will break the monopoly
of overseas products and techniques on the Chinese auto exhaust
gas purifier markets," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The auto exhaust gas purifier market in China has been
dominated by American and German products, as locally made
purifiers could not meet the requirements of the EU1, or the No.1
auto exhaust gas emission standard set by the European Union,
currently used by China as the national standard.
</P>
<P>
The new technique and its products have passed an appraisal by
experts last month, which was organized by the Ministry of
Sciences and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the techniques will be used by the Changchun-based
China First Automobile Group Corp., one of the three leading auto
plants in China.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Boost Garment, Textile Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to boost its
garment and textile production and export by investing 11 trillion
Vietnamese dong (785 million U.S. dollars) in new technology and
build 10 new textile plants between 2001 and 2005, local daily
Vietnam News(VNS) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at making preparations for the country's
freeing up of trade on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam hopes to double its garment and textile export turnover
within five years and triple it within 10 years, VNS quoted an
official of Vietnam National Textile and Garment Corporation as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of exports expected
this year," the official said, "Vietnam's turnover should increase
to 4 billion U.S. dollars in 2005 and 7 billion U.S. dollars in
2010."
</P>
<P>
The garment and textile sector of the country also plans to
increase the country's exports to the United State from just 4
percent of the sector's total export turnover currently, to 44
percent by 2010, equal to the current exports to the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
The official also added that as many as 188 projects in textile
and garment factories worth 179 million dollars were carried out
to improve product quality and design and diversify products to
meet market demands.
</P>
<P>
Under the industry's 10-year growth plan, 1 billion meters of
cloth is expected to be produced, of which 600 million meters will
be suitable for making export garments.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, IMF Sign new Letter of Intent on Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) signed here Thursday a new
agreement on Indonesia's economic reform program, which will pave
the way for a fresh IMF loan disbursement to the country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, also called the letter of intent, was signed
simultaneously by Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Economic
Affairs Rizal Ramli here and First Deputy Managing Director of IMF
Stanley Fischer in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The new accord, which was revised from the previous one, is
largely the same as the previous pact, but it is more
comprehensive compared with the agreement signed on July 31, 2000,
as it contains a 10-point economic recovery program recommended by
the new economic team of the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
The 10-point program includes intensifying the government's
commitment to the development of small and medium industries, to
corporate and banking restructuring, to the privatization program,
to the increase of domestic and foreign investment and to the
development of infrastructure projects in villages.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has seriously carried out the reform
agenda stipulated in the agreement signed on July 31 by the two
sides, including macroeconomic policy, fiscal decentralization,
banking system reforms, corporate restructuring, legal reform and
governance, public sector reform and governance.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the economic recovery, the IMF will focus its
efforts on macroeconomic stability and fiscal balance. And the
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will play a greater role
in agriculture,privatization, small and medium industries and
infrastructure projects in villages.
</P>
<P>
Senior Representative of IMF in Jakarta John Dodsworth Told
Xinhua after the signing of the letter of intent that the IMF will
disburse the next package of loan in third week of September.
</P>
<P>
"But I can't not say the exact number (of the loan package that
will be disbursed). But generally that is around 400 million U.S.
dollars," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The letter of intent has to be approved by the IMF Board of
Directors before the loan can be disbursed.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement, the IMF should disburse 400 million
of its 5 billion U.S. dollars bailout fund to Indonesia at the end
of August. The IMF has so far disbursed more than 700 million
dollars since it made the pledge in January this year to help the
country finance its three-year economic program.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Supports ASEAN-CER Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has backed an
initiative to expand the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) to cover an
area called Closer Economic Relations between Australia and New
Zealand, or known in short as CER, the Thai News Agency (TNA)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will take part in negotiations on the formation of the
so-called AFTA-CER Free Trade Area, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting of the Council of Economic
Ministers this week, which was then endorsed by the cabinet at its
weekly meeting, it said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN economic ministers discussed the formation of the AFTA-
CER Free Trade Area when they met with their CER counterparts in
Singapore in October last year, aiming to open up trade more
widely with countries outside the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN ministers also agreed to set up a high-level task
force to conduct a feasibility study on the establishment of the
proposed AFTA-CER Free Trade Area and to present results of the
study to the 32nd ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting, scheduled to
be held here next month.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
If results of the study are positive, it is expected that the
proposed ASEAN-CER Free Trade Area will take shape by the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
In case of Thailand, the Ministry of Commerce's Department of
Business Economics had also conducted a study on the proposed plan
and found that, in the dynamic dimension, the newly-expanded free
trade area could enhance Thailand's competitiveness and bargaining
power in the world market, though the country would not gain much
in the static term due to minimal trade so far between Thailand
and the CER, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The study suggested, however, that Thailand and the ASEAN should
not accelerate the implementation of the ASEAN-CER Free Trade Area
if they were not ready.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry study also called for the dissemination of
information on the proposed establishment of the AFTA-CER Free
Trade Area and the opening of a public hearing to gather opinions
of the public on the regional scheme, it added.

<P>
LUSAKA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police in Lusaka have
arrested eight of nine suspected gunmen from a government house
whose backyard had been turned into a make-shift garage, Times of
Zambia newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During their operation, the police recovered 10 guns, more than
100 rounds of live ammunition and five stolen motor vehicles from
the suspected robbers. While in the garage, stolen vehicles were
dismantled and reassembled before they were sold.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed by Lusaka division police chief of
operations Peter Chingaipe and Emmasdale police officer-in-charge
Florence Bobo on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Chingaipe as saying the first suspect was
apprehended at a servant's quarters he was renting after he stole
a Toyota Corolla which police recovered.
</P>
<P>
Police later searched the house and recovered the 10 firearms,
99 rounds of live ammunition for the AK rifles and 21 rounds of
9mm pistol live bullets which were also hidden there, Chingaipe
said.
</P>
<P>
Police were still interrogating one of the suspects whom they
believed was part of a notorious gang of dangerous criminals that
had been terrorizing residents in the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bobo said four stolen motor vehicles were recovered
from another house in the city, adding that one of the former
government officer's son was being held together with seven other
suspectes. Two more people were being sought in connection with
the discoveries which also included forged plates.

LOS ANGELES, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Air Force training
plane crashed Wednesday during a student training flight, killing
the pilot, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The T-37 aircraft went down in clear weather in a plowed field
about two km north of Vance Air Force Base, which is located on
the outskirts of Enid, about 130 km north-northwest of Oklahoma
City.
</P>
<P>
The name of the pilot killed was being withheld until relatives
could be notified, said Vance spokesman Kent Cummins.

<HEADLINE> Garlic Smuggling Soars in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou Customs have
recently seen a high frequency of illegal garlic exports, as
itintercepted 400 tons of container garlic smuggling in two major
cases in August.
</P>
<P>
Panyu Customs, a subsidiary of Guangzhou Customs, foiled the
smuggling attempts on August 24 and 26. Smugglers of the two boats,
named Yuntong and Huishi, were caught loading garlic into
containers destined for Hong Kong, without valid export documents.
</P>
<P>
Customs police said that licence management has been imposed
for export-oriented garlic. The smugglers evaded the export
management for a bigger profit margin.
</P>
<P>
The period from August to December is the big season for garlic
smuggling. The customs police have vowed to fight the illegal
exporting of garlic to protect the order of the normal trade.
</P>
<P>
China's Exit-Entry Inspection and Quarantine Bureau is
currently seeking effective ways to benefit the country's exports
of garlic. Foreign customs authorities often use strict animal and
plant quarantines as a technical barrier in trade to block imports
of the China-made farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month the garlic trade dispute between China and
the Republic of Korea (ROK) brought increased attention to China's
garlic exports. According to an agreement, ROK will import 32,000
tons of Chinese garlic with low tariffs this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is suffering a
brain drain with many skilled young people leaving for foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
During the period from July 1999 to June 2000, 71,045 people,
including a lot of young ones, left for overseas, registering a
net migration loss of 9,760, according to figures issued by
Statistics New Zealand here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Wellington is the biggest victim of New
Zealand's brain drain, losing more young professionals to jobs
overseas than any other centers.
</P>
<P>
It lost 8,360 people overseas in the year with 5,000 of them
aged under 30. The capital city had a net migration loss of 3,076.
</P>
<P>
Though Wellington accounts for only 9 percent of the national
population, it makes up 32 percent of the net migration loss.
</P>
<P>
It is said Wellingtonians are better educated and would find it
easier to get work overseas.
</P>
<P>
Christchurch, the biggest city on South Island, has the same
problem as Wellington. It suffered a net migration loss of 1,831
during the year.
</P>
<P>
Australia is the biggest benefactor, with 36,296 crossing the
Tasman.
</P>
<P>
The economic slump and low salaries are the main reasons for
many skilled young people to leave New Zealand for foreign
countries.

<P>
WELLINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealanders are advised
to defer all non-essential travel to the Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
The advice was contained in a notice issued here Thursday by
the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
The notice said the security situation in the Solomon Islands
remains"unstable."
</P>
<P>
"A cease-fire agreement between rival militant groups was
signed on August 3, but has been breached on a number of occasions.
Initial peace talks are scheduled to begin on September 7.
Grievances which gave rise to the crisis are yet to be resolved,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the notice added, there have been occasional
clashes between militant groups and instances of lawless acts.
</P>
<P>
Although expatriates have not generally been targeted, they
have been caught up in some incidents, it said.
</P>
<P>
The notice urged New Zealanders in the Solomon Islands to
register with the New Zealand High Commission in Honiara if they
have not already done so.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Dollar Hits All-Time Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar took
a dive to another all-time low Thursday afternoon, reaching 41.88
U.S. cents, according to Television New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The fall below 42 U.S. cents was brief as the local currency
soon rebounded to around the 42 U.S. cent mark.
</P>
<P>
The fall of the New Zealand dollar was triggered by a weakened
Australian dollar, which in turn was sideswiped by the weak euro.
</P>
<P>
Local economic analysts were quoted as saying the loss was also
prompted by New Zealand's continuing large merchandise trade
deficit of 3.1 billion NZ dollars for the year from August 1999 to
July 2000.
</P>
<P>
The annual trade deficit was made public here Thursday by the

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government-MILF Talks Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Moro Islamic Liberation Front(
MILF) peace negotiators failed to appear at the scheduled sixth
round of meeting with their government counterparts in the
southern Philippines Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MILF spokesman Eid Kabalu said they opted not to show up at the
venue of the talks in Cotabato city, Maguindanao Province, as they
have yet to come up with a new set of negotiators after the MILF's
Central Committee disbanded the old group headed by rebel chief
negotiator Aleem Abdulaziz Mimbantas.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the MILF Central Committee headed by chieftain Hashim
Salamat dissolved the peace panel, saying they could not talk
peace with the government while its armed forces are attacking
their camps.
</P>
<P>
With this new development, government chief negotiator Edgado
Batenga said his group could only hope that the MILF would return
to the negotiating table soon for them to resolve the dragging
Mindanao problem.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and MILF declared that they are not closing
their doors for a peaceful solution to the decades-old armed
Mindanao conflict that has already claimed the lives of an
estimated 120,000 people since 1969.

<HEADLINE> MANILA Tries to Keep Food Prices Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Following the latest oil price
hike and the depreciation of the peso, the Philippine government
said Thursday that it is doing everything possible to keep food
prices stable.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said in a radio interview
that food takes up the biggest chunk of the ordinary Filipinos'
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing everything to stabilize the prices of food items.
We can not prevent a price hike because of the price increase in
oil and the fall of the peso," Angara said.
</P>
<P>
He also said he would propose to President Joseph Estrada the
return of the Food Terminal Inc. (FTI) under the Agriculture
Department so it can play a more active role in food security.
</P>
<P>
According to Angara, the FTI has cold storage facilities that
would keep vegetable supply from the provinces fresh or at least
prevent them from spoiling early.
</P>
<P>
"The FTI was removed from the Agriculture Department when we
could have played a key role in food production. Perhaps, I would
recommend to the president that we reconnect the FTI and the
department. The FTI has good storage facilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Agriculture Department is planning to
establish a"cold chain system" similar to the one in Japan, where
producers bring their vegetables to a central area.
</P>
<P>
Angara said the fall of the peso and the hike in oil prices
have also jacked up the prices of diesel.

XIAMEN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The fourth China Investment and
Trade Fair will be held in Xiamen Special Economic Zone, east
China's coastal province of Fujian, from September 8-12.
</P>
<P>
The annual fair, the only national activity aiming to lure
direct overseas funds, is sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, Fujian Provincial People's
Government and Xiamen City People's Government.

<P>
The fair is designed to absorb overseas funds, trade products
made by foreign-funded enterprises, and conduct internal and
foreign trade activities.
</P>
<P>
An international investment forum will be held during this
trade fair.

The three previous fairs, also held in Xiamen, have enabled
overseas investors to understand China's latest investment
policies, while also enabling Chinese enterprises to gain an
understanding of the worldwide capital movement.

<HEADLINE> Background: China's Introduction to Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that by July
this year, overseas investors from more than 180 countries and
regions have established more than 353,700 overseas-funded
enterprises in China. Total foreign investment has exceeded 327.7
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overseas funds were introduced to China 20 years ago. The first
overseas-funded enterprise in China was set up by a Hong Kong
businessman in 1980.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, more than 30 countries and regions invested
in China, mainly in eastern coastal areas. The foreign funds
mainly went to the industrial and building sectors.
</P>
<P>
China witnessed its fastest growth in terms of foreign
investment in the early 1990s. The number of overseas-funded
enterprises increased by 12 times from 1989 to now, and the total
investment went up by 16.5 times. Registered capital increased by
17 times and employees in overseas-funded enterprises grew by 12.5
times during the ten-year period.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has taken the lead in luring foreign
funds among developing countries for seven consecutive years since
1993. At present, some 400 of the world's top 500 multinationals
have invested in China.
</P>
<P>
The import and export volume of foreign-funded enterprises
accounted for 50 percent of China's total. Chinese people who are
working at foreign-funded enterprises account for one-tenth of
China's total non-agricultural laborers.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that, in recent years, foreign investment
has started flowing to the service sector and the western region
instead of just going to the industrial sector and eastern coastal
areas.

<HEADLINE> Viagra Proves Effective for Chinese Patients (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- After two years' of clinical
trials, Chinese medical experts have concluded that the anti-
impotence drug Viagra is an effective, safe oral treatment for
Chinese patients with erectile dysfunction (ED).
</P>
<P>
Guo Yinglu, director of the Institute of Urology at Beijing
University, led a medical team carrying out the test, which was
conducted in line with the strictest international Good Clinical
Practice (GCP) guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Results of the Chinese study were similar to those conducted in
western countries.
</P>
<P>
Guo and his colleagues presented the results of the clinical
trials for Viagra in China to the 5th Asian Congress on Urology,
which was held from August 27 to 31 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The overall success rate for the treatment of patients with ED
caused by physical, psychological and mixed conditions, was 81
percent, said Guo, also academician of the Chinese Academy of
Engineering.
</P>
<P>
The institute organized the second phase of clinical trials,
which tested the effectiveness and safety of the drug on 628 ED
patients, before its official launch, in seven hospitals in
Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan between September 1998 and February
1999.
</P>
<P>
"The study proves that Viagra is effective, simple to use,
reliable and it has no side-effects," Guo said. "There were no
cases of patients discontinuing use of the drug because of adverse
effects."
</P>
<P>
World medical circles said that the test results in China
provided more comprehensive guidelines for clinical applications
of Viagra. Patients in China have significant differences to
Western subjects, such as a lower body mass index.

"The Viagra clinical study in China was a high level study, in
accordance with international general principles," said Tom Lue,
professor of the Urology Department at University of California,
San Francisco in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The result is consistent with Western studies," said Lue. "
Viagra is effective and safe for the Chinese population."
</P>
<P>
Andrew McCullough, professor at New York University School of
Medicine, said, "The strict phase two trials in China further
prove the safety and effectiveness of Viagra."
</P>
<P>
Viagra, widely regarded as a breakthrough treatment for ED, was
developed by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, and is the first
effective and safe oral medication for ED treatment in the world.
</P>
<P>
China's State Drug Administration (SDA) approved the production
and sales of Viagra in the country from July 3. Since then, the
drug has been available at general hospitals at county level or
above, but only with a doctor's prescription.
</P>
<P>
China is the 101st country to give the green light to the
diamond-shaped blue pill, which is marketed under the Chinese name
"wan ai ke," though it has long been known throughout the country
as "wei ge" -- a Chinese phrase literally meaning "Strong Brother.
"
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that at least 100 million males worldwide
suffer from ED. Meanwhile, medical experts estimate that ten
percent of Chinese adult males suffer from impotence, a condition
often associated with age, hypertension, diabetes and unhealthy
lifestyles such as smoking and excessively drinking.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the world, more than eight million ED patients had
taken Viagra by the end of April, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Texas Replaces Montana As Focus Of U.S. Wildfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Drought-stricken Texas has
replaced Montana as the focus of wildfires in the United States,
according to press reports here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here say there are presently 35 wildfires
burning in Texas, 24 in Montana, 19 in Idaho and two in Wyoming.
Other states including Nevada, New Mexico, South Dakota, Arkansas,
California and Mississippi were reported to have only one fire
each.
</P>
<P>
While most of the fires are small compared with the giant
blazes still burning in the northern Rocky mountains, some of the
Texas fires have destroyed homes, are threatening towns and
forcing evacuations, firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
A 5,000-acre fire north of Beaumont jumped a highway and
destroyed several structures, according to the National
Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Texas. It said the town of
Newton is threatened and evacuations are occurring.
</P>
<P>
A blaze west of San Antonio is keeping about 250 people out of
their homes.
</P>
<P>
In New Caney, north of Houston, about 100 residents were
evacuated to a middle school until a 300-acre fire was contained.
</P>
<P>
Crews from Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida are helping
battle fires in Texas where 180,627 acres have burned so far this
year, compared with 1,241,290 acres in Idaho and 935,699 acres in
Montana.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, wildfires throughout the United States have
burned 6,602,499 acres, the fire center said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although some fire-danger restrictions remain in place in
Montana, the focus of U.S. fires during the past two months, road
barriers and land-closure signs came down Tuesday as millions of
acres of land were reopened to hikers and other outdoors
enthusiasts as cooler weather helped firefighters get the upper
hand on some blazes.
</P>
<P>
Similar conditions in Idaho have enabled officials to reopen
more than 2 million acres of land that had been closed.

<HEADLINE> California Bank Robber Surrenders, Releases Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A gunman surrendered to
police Wednesday afternoon following a foiled robbery and hostage
situation at a bank in the Orange County, California. No injuries
were reported from the incident.
</P>
<P>
The drama came to a close shortly after 2 p.m. local time, when
the gunman lay face down in a parking lot and police arrested him.
</P>
<P>
Officer Robin Kapp, a spokesman for the Westminster Police
Department, said someone in the bank called police, and the silent
alarm was also activated. Officers responded to the scene.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, the suspect saw the officers, and that's when the
suspect took the hostages," Kapp said.
</P>
<P>
Kapp said the gunman released 12 hostages almost immediately
after the incident began. Two hours into the drama, another five
hostages were seen leaving the bank, and the gunman surrendered
shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Kapp said none of the hostages were injured by the gunman. But
he said that someone at the scene collapsed and required medical
attention.
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour siege, the gunman fired one shot into the
ceiling, but it didn't appear anyone was seriously hurt in the
takeover, Kapp said.
</P>
<P>
Helicopter images of the siege at the Orange County bank, 60
kilometers southeast of Los Angeles, were shown nationally on
television.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, described as an Asian in his 30s, stormed into the
Bank of America at about noon with a TEC-9 handgun and claimed to
have a bomb in a backpack or bag that he carried with him.
</P>
<P>
A bomb squad was then summoned to search the bank for explosive
devices.

<HEADLINE> Estonia to Further Develop Relations with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TALLINN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Estonia will try its best to
further the relations and cooperation with China with a focus on
strengthening economic links and expanding cultural exchange, said
Toomas Savi, Estonia's parliament speaker.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the initiatives taken by both sides, the relations
between Estonia and China have grown rapidly since the
independence of the Baltic republic in 1991, Savi told Xinhua in
an interview on the eve of the official visit by Li Peng, chairman
of the National Standing Committee of China's National People's
Conference.
</P>
<P>
The development of bilateral relations is marked by the
frequent exchange of visits at various levels and from the
different circles of the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The future cooperation between the two countries should focus
on economic and cultural exchanges and one of the promising areas
is transport, the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese goods can be shipped to the European market via Estonia
and cooperation is already underway between the railway
authorities of the two countries, Savi said, adding that Estonia
is also interested in enhancing cooperation with China in marine
and air transport.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed an aviation agreement in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Savi also thanked China for the continued support for Estonia's
sovereignty and understanding of Estonia's political choice.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM: G-77 Decision-Making "Bulky, Unwieldy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Thursday described the decision-making process of
the G-77 as "bulky and unwieldy".
</P>
<P>
"In the G-77, everything must be done through consensus by the
130 heads of government. Obviously it is bulky and unwieldy," he
told a news conference at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport
in Sepang on his return from a three-day working visit to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir proposed that the G-77 consider delegating certain
tasks to a smaller number of heads of government to make the
grouping more effective.
</P>
<P>
He however said he doubted this would happen as G-77 leaders
preferred to discuss every matter among themselves.
</P>
<P>
"Of course if they want to (participate), it's okay by us but I
don't think it's practically going to work at all," Mahathir who
attended a special G-77 summit in New York said.
</P>
<P>
The G-77 is a grouping of developing countries of the South.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said compared to the G-8 which groups the world's most
developed countries, it was more difficult for the G-77 to conduct
meetings due to the size of the grouping.
</P>
<P>
He said that the only time that the views of the G-77 could be
put across to the G-8 was after the convening of the G-77 summit
meeting in Havana last April.
</P>
<P>
"Even then, they (G-77) did not meet the G-8 heads of
government because they (G-8) did not think they should consider
the views of the South at all," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the United States, Mahathir received the
Lariba Lifetime Achievement Award 2000 from the American-based
Islamic financial house in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was the first ever recipient of the award, conferred
on an international leader for outstanding contributions to the
development of the Muslim world.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges Laos to Withdraw From Border Islets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand on Thursday urged
Laos to withdraw its militia from three yet-to-be-demarcated small
islets in the border river of Mekong.
</P>
<P>
The islets, situated in the Mekong river between Thai Chiangrai
province, 785 north of Bangkok, and the northern Lao province of
Bokeo, should left untouched until the border is properly
demarcated, said an announcement from the Thai Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Thai provincial officials said that a group of over 30 Lao
militiamen have been deployed in the Koh Mano 1, Koh Mano 2 and
Koh Phakham islets since last week, where Thai villagers grow corn
in the dry season, but abandon them in the flooding season.
</P>
<P>
Thai authorities have ordered the villagers to stop using these
islets to prevent any future dispute, the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
To seek the opinions from the Lao side, it said Chiang Rai
Governor Samreng Boonyopakorn will meet his Lao counterpart of
Bokeo Friday to discuss the problem.
</P>
<P>
Also, Lao Ambassador to Thailand Hiem Phommachan will soon be
summoned to Thai Foreign Ministry for this issue, it added.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Lao have agreed to demarcate their river boundary
after their land border is properly marked. The two countries
share 702 kilometers land frontier and 398 kilometers river border,
and 65 percent of the land border have been demarcated.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Drops One Place in Global Competitive Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the Swiss-based forum's Global
Competitiveness Report 2000 as saying Thailand's competitiveness
has fallen one place to 31st this year among the 59 economies
under the survey.
</P>
<P>
The United States is ranked as the world's most competitive
nation, advancing from second place last year due largely to major
advances in technological development. It is followed by Singapore,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Ireland, Finland, Canada, Hong Kong,
the United Kingdom and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The survey, measuring the conditions that determine a nation's
sustainable level of productivity, found that Thailand still has a
long way to go in enhancing its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
In product design, scientific research, technology and private
spending on research and development, Thailand is ranked 56th,
54th, 52nd and 45th respectively. Its banking system is ranked
56th, almost at the bottom, while the supervision of the banking
system is ranked 53rd.
</P>
<P>
But the survey scores Thailand highly on its openness,
particularly the exchange rate alignment and export promotion
which are ranked 9th and 13th respectively.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's access to external finance is also very open, ranked
at second place. The national saving rate is also high at 6th
place, while the investment rate is 10th.
</P>
<P>
In economic creativity, Thailand is ranked 40th, with
innovation at 50th, technology transfer at 36th and start-ups at
32nd.
</P>
<P>
All other Asian economies, except India, also dropped in
ranking this year.
</P>
<P>
The survey is useful for countries to understand the factors
that contribute to future growth of their economies, measured as
the rate of change of the gross domestic product per person. These
factors explain why some countries are improving their prosperity
faster than others.

UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides told world leaders on Wednesday that there is no
more obvious example of the UN's failure to carry out resolutions
than the case of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the three-day U.N. Millennium Summit, which opened
this morning at the U.N. headquarters in New York, Clerides said
the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council must be
respected and implemented.
</P>
<P>
"There is no more flagrant example of this failure in
implementing resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the
Security Council than the case of Cyprus," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Numerous resolutions " were not implemented for over a quarter
of a century. This failure constitutes nothing less than an
affront to the international community," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
"We are now engaged in yet another effort to solve the Cyprus
problem. I will participate in the forthcoming negotiations, as
always with good will and determination, to find a just and viable
solution within parameters established by UN resolutions, a
solution that will meet the interests and restore and safeguard
human rights for all Cypriots," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since 1974 when troops
from Turkey occupied the north of the island in response to a coup
in Nicosia by the then ruling Greek junta

<P>
JAKARTA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations force in
East Timor has safely evacuated 54 humanitarian workers from
Atambua, a city of Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province, where
four U.N. staff were killed Wednesday in an attack on the office
of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) by East Timor
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force sent four helicopters from East Timor town of
Suai to Atambua immediately after the attack occurred. As of 8:00
p.m., the U.N. staff in Atambua had been evacuated to Dili,
capital of East Timor, while some others were being located to the
East Nusa Tenggara provincial capital of Kupang and other parts of
Indonesia, the Jakarta Post daily Thursday quoted the U.N. office
in Jakarta as saying.
</P>
<P>
Four U.N. staff were killed and one badly injured when
thousands of angry mobs and militiamen attacked and burned the
UNHCR office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said militiamen beat four foreign U.N. workers to
death and burned their bodies in the street.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. building was also set on fire by the mob angered by
the unsolved death a day earlier of a prominent militia leader,
accused of committing atrocities in East Timor last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jake Morland, UNHCR spokesman in Kupang, said 90
UNHCR staffers elsewhere in the province were on the standby for
possible evacuation in case the violence spread.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency has been delivered aid to an estimated 90,000
refugees who have lingered in border in camps after fleeing
violence in East Timor 12 months ago.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night in Atambua, Udayana military Commander Kiki
Syahnakri met with UNHCR officials, police representatives and
local administration officials. After the meeting, he said a joint
team would be formed to investigate the death of U.N. workers and

JAKARTA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Navy is
planning to buy four MI-17 personnel carrier helicopters from
Russia, Navy Chief Admiral Achmad Sucipto said.
</P>
<P>
"In the near future, the Indonesian navy will be equipped with
four MI-17 helicopters that will be capable of carrying 24 marines
from a warship," Antara news agency Thursday quoted Sucipto as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The navy chief said Wednesday in Surabaya, East Java, that the
purchase of the four helicopters would be funded by export credits
in the navy budget's routine expenditures, but did not say what
the price tag was.
</P>
<P>
He said the helicopters would greatly enhance the mobility of
the marines and would match that of similar units in neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
With the greater mobility, incidents in remote and difficult
areas could be quickly handled and prevented from spreading,

<HEADLINE> Asian Pension Market Projected to Reach $12 Trillion by 2030 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Asia, with nearly 3
trillion U.S. dollars invested in pension funds, has become one of
the most important pension fund markets in the world, according to
a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Now equivalent to one quarter of the U.S. pension fund market,
the Asian pension market is projected to continue to increase by 6
percent annually to reach 12 trillion U.S. dollars by the year
2030, said the report from the U.S.-based Nelson Information, a
division of Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
The five fastest growing countries within this market are
expected to be China with a 44 percent annual growth, Indonesia,
the Philippines, India and Malaysia. The World Bank expects the
Japanese and Chinese markets to exceed 8 trillion U.S. dollars by
2030, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Japan, with 2.2 trillion U.S. dollars invested in pension funds,
accounts for 81 percent of the region's total.
</P>
<P>
Even though pension fund asset allocations in Asia show
relatively low weighting to international equities, substantial
flows toward foreign investment management companies should occur
as investment restrictions are removed, the report said.

<HEADLINE> New Program Planned for Refurbishing Yuanmingyuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have approved
of a plan to refurbish the ruins in Yuanmingyuan Park in Beijing,
according to the latest weekly of Beijing Review.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction of the park will be aimed at protecting its
present conditions, rather than reverting to the "prosperity of
old days".
</P>
<P>
The program focuses on proper utilization and protection in a
scientific way with following measures:
</P>
<P>
-- Removing the residents, work units and amusement facilities
inside the ruins which do not comply with the surrounding ambience;
</P>
<P>
-- Cleaning up and rearranging the whole site with protective
measures;
</P>
<P>
-- Recovering the original outline of hills and water system
and planting vegetation;
</P>
<P>
-- Rebuilding paths, bridges, pavilions, terraces, open halls
and arch gates at the entrance to the park and to Changchunyuan,
as well as the "Hanjin Hall" which will house historic relics of
Yuanmingyuan.
</P>
<P>
Yuanmingyuan, located in west Beijing in an area traditionally
home to parks and gardens, was one of the most outstanding parks
in the world 140 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Emperors of several generations lived and handled the country's
affairs in the park with numerous gems, cultural relics and books
for the imperial family.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the park, covering 350 ha, was looted and burned
by the British and French imperialists in 1860, and then further
destroyed by the allied army of eight imperialist countries at the
end of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
The park was formally renamed as "Yuanmingyuan Ruins Park" in
early 1983.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shuqin, senior engineer of the Beijing Research and Design
Institute for Urban Planning, said that the scenic area of Xiyang
Building, the typical architecture of Yuanmingyuan when it existed,
will not be rebuilt on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
Wu, taking charge of the new Yuanmingyuan program, added that
other destroyed buildings will just be renovated for protection,
not totally refurbished in every aspect.
</P>
<P>
The Yuanmingyuan site is composed of three parks: Yuanmingyuan,
Changchunyuan and Wanchunyuan and the redeveloped Yuanmingyuan
Ruins Park will cover an area of 4,589 ha.
</P>
<P>
It will have two sections: One is the ruins of the three old
parks, where no new architecture of scenic works will be built.
</P>
<P>
The other is the newly added 100-ha areas surrounding the ruins.
It will contain gardens and service trade buildings.
</P>
<P>
The height and color of the buildings to be built are required
to comply with the ambience of Yuanmingyuan.

<HEADLINE> Younger Managers Appointed for State Firm </HEADLINE>

CHANGCHUN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- First Automobile Works (FAW),
China's largest automobile manufacturer in northeast China's Jilin
Province, appointed a new managing team, reducing the average age
of the managers from 53.6 years old to 47.8.
</P>
<P>
The new FAW managing team is made up of nine members, five less
than the last term, and the new general manager Zhu Yanfeng is 39
years old.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the change in the FAW, a state-owned enterprise,
reflects the government's change of attitude towards the
management structure of such enterprises. The government is making
state-owned enterprises more efficient by using fewer and younger
managers.
</P>
<P>
More young people have been appointed as managers of state
enterprises for their strong sense of competition and creative
ideas in the face of the market economy.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Back to School to Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China's ten million primary
and middle school teachers will get a look at the classroom from
the other side of the desk when they became students in a bid to
improve teaching quality.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of a provision that requires teachers to go on
training programs every five years to update their skills,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A total of ten million teachers will all receive professional
training within the next five years, said Ma Li, director of the
Department for Teacher Training and Education under the Ministry
of Education.
</P>
<P>
The participants will attend part-time classes to learn how to
improve their teaching methods in such subjects as Chinese,
English, mathematics, physics and biology.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they will also learn about psychology so they can
understand their students better, said Ma.
</P>
<P>
Harsh treatment and physical punishment have been met out by
some teachers with poor training and have led to tragedies, such
as students committing suicide over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Upgrading teachers competence and morality is a priority of the
central government and the ministry, officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to ministry's statistics, nearly 95 percent of
teachers in primary schools, 83 percent in junior middle schools
and 64 in senior middle schools have received State-set
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
We urgently need to improve teacher proficiency because they
play a vital role in raising the skills of Chinese citizens, Ma
said.
</P>
<P>
Ma also said that the education background of newly-employed
primary and middle school teachers will meet higher learning
institution level by 2010.
</P>
<P>
At present, the academic standards of primary and middle school
teachers range from senior middle school to college level, sources
at the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In rural and less developed areas, many school teachers have
had a poorer education, but still hold teaching positions because
they are needed.
</P>
<P>
China implemented the Regulation of Teacher Quality in 1995 to
upgrade teaching. And the country will fully establish a teaching
qualification system in the next few years.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Revenue Up in First Semester </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 7 (Xinhua) -- More revenue was collected
by the Cambodian government during the first six months of this
year, but nearly half of the country's domestic budget is still
being spent on security and defense, Finance Minister Keat Chhon
was quoted by local newspapers Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of expenditure, spending on health, education,
agriculture and rural development was slow. But it will be caught
up in the second semester," Keat Chhon said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ministry of Finance figures, the government
generated 184 million U.S. dollars through tax revenue and other
fees between January and June -- slightly less than the target for
that time period, but up 5.4 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Tax revenue reached 137 million, or 74 percent of the total
current revenue in the first six months while value added tax -- a
10 percent tax imposed on services and goods generated 50 million,
making a 5.6 million leap from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
But revenue from customs duties declined 12 percent from 59.7
million in 1999 to 52.9 million in the same period this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 611.7 million has been budgeted for Cambodia during
the year 2000, but only 390.9 million is raised domestically. The
remainder comes from the international community.

<HEADLINE> International Trafficker Involved in Illegal Arms Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- An international arms trafficker
may be involved in the illegal sale of weapons to the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas, said two
Peruvian military officers to the La Republica newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sarkis Soghanalian, a 60-year-old Lebanese, supervised the
shipment of 10,000 rifles from the Jordanian capital of Amman last
year; it is believed the weapons were sent to FARC, Peruvian army
technicians Santos Cenepo Shapiama and Luis Alberto Meza were
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The officers affirmed that the Lebanese trafficker was in the
Peruvian capital in the first few weeks of 1999 to coordinate the
shipment of arms with his Peruvian partners. The arms were
reportedly bought in Jordan and then transported to the Colombian
jungle in Illyusin-76 planes piloted by Ukrainian crews.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian authorities have investigated this case of arms
trafficking, and former Peruvian Army lieutenant Luis Aybar Cancho,
now working with FARC, was supposedly a leader of the gang
involved.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian military judicial authorities in charge of the
investigation have so far discovered the alleged participation of
33 persons, among them civilians and former members of the
Peruvian Armed Forces who allegedly forged official documents to
acquire the weapons, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Children Compensated after Taking Rat Poison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Two children from Shanghai
received 10,000 yuan and 12,000 yuan in compensation respectively
after accidentally taking rat poison at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
On May 25 last year, Xu Wenhao, 5, and Zhu Wenjun, 2, together
with their respective parents, went to the Yueyou restaurant for a
meal. Xu and Zhu ate some groundnut kernels they found in a corner
of the dining hall, which turned out to be rat poison.
</P>
<P>
They were soon rushed to a local hospital and escaped danger
after doctors used a gastric lavage on them.
</P>
<P>
Their parents appealed to a local court for a compensation of
over 30,000 yuan from the restaurant, by accusing it of placing
rat poison without a warning, while the restaurant argued that the
parents were irresponsible for not guarding their children.
</P>
<P>
The two sides finally reached an agreement on the compensation
under the mediation of the local court.

<HEADLINE> China Adopts Environment-Friendly Way to Dispose Rubbish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China is adopting an
environment-friendly way of rubbish disposal by building its
largest rubbish-burning fueled power plant in Shanghai, China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The plant to be built in Shanghai's Pudong New District is
designed to have the capacity to generate 100,000 megawatts of
electricity annually by means of thermal energy generated through
burning 365,000 tons of rubbish, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The project, expected to be completed in October 2001, will
cost 670 million yuan (80.7 million U.S. dollars), including a low-
interest loan of 30.17 million offered by the French government.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the loan will be used to buy some key
technology and equipment from France for the new power plant, an
official surnamed Tao who is responsible for the construction of
the plant and the installation of the equipment was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The plant will keep a close eye on the discharge of waste gas
and smoke and fume emissions in accordance with the emission
standards set by the European Union, said the official, adding
that the new plant will become a pilot project for neighboring
areas of Shanghai and other big cities in terms of rubbish
disposal.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now yields more than 10,000 tons of household waste
every day, of which about 80 percent is buried after a fermenting
procedure to decrease harmful elements.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs Foreign Credit for Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States Treasury
Department has agreed to support Colombia for the acquisition of
foreign resources of at least 1.2 billion dollars, Colombian
Finance Minister Juan Manuel Santos said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The operation will be carried out in the first days of next
year with the floating of bonds that will be backed by the World
Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, said Santos.
</P>
<P>
Colombia faces obstacles to entry into the international money
markets because of a lack of confidence in the economy of the
country and its internal political situation, according to
financial experts.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said that the credit is one of the first
results of contacts with the U.S. economic authorities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the obtaining of foreign resources will need a
reduction of the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Minister met Tuesday with U.S. Treasury Secetary
Lawrence Summers, who offered full support to the adjustment plan
and asked the international financial community to restablish its
confidence in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Santos also met with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
executives that will decide on Thursday on the performance of the
Colombian economy, as well as with the fulfillment of the
commitments and the adjustment targets.
</P>
<P>
Bank of the Republic manager MIguel Urrutia Montoya said that
Colombia will not have problems for a good rating by the IMF,
because it fulfilled its budget and monetary commitments, and
strengthened its international reserves.

<HEADLINE> Expressway Gives Way to Ancient Tree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A group of expressway builders
recently re-drew the route of a planned expressway in an effort to
save a 400-year-old gingko tree.
</P>
<P>
The gingko tree is located in Lishui county in east China's
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
"The gingko tree was found obstructing the expressway designed
to connect Nanjing and Hangzhou, capitals of Jiangsu and Zhejiang
Provinces, which will cut the seven-hour-trip between the two
cities to 2.5 hours," said an engineer working with the expressway
project.
</P>
<P>
"Experts suggested redesigning the route because the tree might
die if it is removed, some local farmers also rendered that they
would rather support the new route, which would demand them to
pull down some of their houses, than sacrifice the tree," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Finally, we took the advice and decided to change the route."
</P>
<P>
This is not the only tree-protecting story in China. In
Yangzhou of Jiangsu Province, an old tree and a small traditional
tower are still standing in the middle of a major road in the
downtown area.
</P>
<P>
In Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu, two parterres were built
surrounding two ancient trees on a road near the Nanjing airport.
</P>
<P>
"Trees used to give way to the constructions, now we are very
happy to do the reverse thing," said an official with the Nanjing
Bureau of Parks and Woods.

<HEADLINE> Zhuhai to Be Urbanized Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, September 7 (Xinhua) --Authorities of Zhuhai, south
China's Guangdong Province, have pledged to make greater efforts
to further urbanize the city in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the city's pre-set goal of realizing
modernization by the year 2007, Zhuhai's urbanization level will
be at 87 percent, said Mayor Huang Longyun.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the per capita gross domestic product (GDP)
of the city will reach 5,050 U.S. dollars by 2007, and the output
value of high-tech products will make up 28 percent of the city's
total industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai, the nearest Chinese mainland city to Macao, is also one
of China's four earliest special economic zones (SEZ). It
celebrated the 20th anniversary of its founding late last month.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, Zhuhai has experienced an annual
economic growth rate of 24 percent. It has grown from a tiny
fishing village into a bustling seaside city with sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Zhuhai was cited by the U.N. Center for Human
Settlements (Habitat) as a model city in the world for
comprehensive environmental management amid rapid urban growth. It
has been chosen as the venue for China International Air Show, a
biennial event, and for international (Formula) motor racing.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai now has an urban population of over 400,000. The fine
urban environment and its special geographic position have turned
the city into a popular site for investments among overseas
investors. It is now home to over 3,000 overseas-financed
businesses, including those run by multinationals such as Amoco,
Iwatani and Seibu of Japan. By the end of 1999, a total of 7.75
billion U.S. dollars of overseas capital had been invested into
the city.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Huang said that they have been concentrating efforts to
build the city into five functional zones since the beginning of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The five zones are: the state high-tech industrial development
zone, bonded zone for foreign trade, industrial zone adjacent to
the port, Wanshan experimental zone for marine development, and
Hengqin development zone for international tourism, holiday makers
and theme parks.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment has kept flowing into the five zones. By
late June, 83 overseas-financed projects have been approved to be
built in the zones, involving 218 million U.S. dollars of foreign
direct investment.

<HEADLINE> Radiation-Preventing Material Distilled From Vegetables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
discovered a formula that prevents natural radiation from plants
belonging to the mustard plant family, like radishes and cabbages.
</P>
<P>
The formula, named SP88, was created by scientists at the
Shanghai Institution of Plant Ecophysiology with Chinese Academy
of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The institution has gained a patent for SP88 and will put it
into mass production soon, an institute source said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists with that institution said SP88 can be widely
applied to various fields, including relieving the radiation from
ionization and electromagnetism, and counteracting the decrease of
leukocyte and thrombocyte during the radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
Experiments on calves, mice and fruit flies indicated that SP88
works by restraining the excessive radicals in cells, which damage
big molecules and causes the malfunction of cells.
</P>
<P>
Scientists also validated the function of SP88 by comparing two
groups of wheat seeds growing in a satellite, one was immersed in
SP88 solution and the other in distilled water. It turned out that
the radiation had much less of an ill effect on the former group.

LOS ANGELES, September 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. school children of
all ages "are riding the information superhighway in their pursuit
of education," a U.S. market researcher said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More than three-fourths of U.S. PC households with students are
accessing the Internet, and almost 70 percent of online households
with students are using it to complete school work, according to a
survey conducted by International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
The Internet is reshaping the education of K-12 students, said
IDC, citing students going online to get assignments and the
information they need to complete assignments.
</P>
<P>
IDC found that households with students are more likely to have
PCs than households in general. At the beginning of the year, 52
percent of households had PCs, as compared to 65 percent of
households with students.
</P>

Internet use varies widely by students, according to IDC. While
fewer than 53 percent of elementary school children with home
access to the Internet complete schoolwork with online resources,
the percentage increases to 84 percent of middle and high school
students. The nature of school assignments and the greater freedom
accorded to older children to explore the Internet on their own
help account for the difference, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC's study, the most common online school-related
activity in households with children in elementary school is to
communicate with teachers and administrators. Parents would play a
key role in this. In households with middle or high school
students, the most common use is to get class assignments. The
students rather than the parents would most likely to be gathering
this information.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet is also poised to become a key force in community
building between school and the home," IDC said. "A variety of
activities are already being performed online, and Internet use
will continue to grow dramatically as teachers and administrators
expand their use of the technology for a variety of purposes."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Holds Summit Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The meeting, attended by all the leaders of the Security
Council's 15 members and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
adopted a resolution and a declaration, reaffirming that the
Security Council shoulders the primary responsibility for the
maintenance of international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, which was under the main theme "Ensuring the
Security Council's Role in Maintenance International Peace and
Security, Particularly in Africa," the leaders expressed their
determination to enhance the U.N. ability in peacekeeping
operations and its cooperation with regional organizations such as
the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin delivered a speech at the meeting,
elaborating China's stand on such issues as enhancing the Security
Council's authority, U.N. peacekeeping operations, the reform of
the Security Council and the African issue.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "Willful use of force and interference in the
internal affairs of other countries in the name of '
humanitarianism' not only run counter to the purposes and
principles of the U.N. Charter, but also will cause severe
negative consequences."
</P>
<P>
On peacekeeping operations, Jiang said facts have proven that
the success of the U.N. peacekeeping operations depends on
observance of the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter. "It
is essential to treat symptoms and remove the root causes that
lead to conflicts at the same time," he added.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the reform of the Security Council, the Chinese
leader said that the expansion of the Security Council should be
based on the principle of equitable geographical distribution and
should first of all address the under-representation of the
developing countries in the council.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his agreement to give priority to the African
question at this summit, calling for greater attention paid by the
U.N. and the Security Council to Africa and increasing input into
that continent.
</P>
<P>
He expressed China's readiness to work together with other U.N.
member states to strengthen the role of the Security Council in
maintaining international peace and security.

<HEADLINE> Prince Charles Launches Scholarship to Open up Architecture to Ethnic Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Prince of Wales Thursday
launched a scholarship to try to open up architecture to the
ethnic minorities, in memory of the murdered black teenager
Stephen Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
His Foundation for Architecture and the Urban Environment will
pay about 10,000 pounds (14,500 U.S. dollars) a year to fund an
ethnic minority student through architectural school, the BBC
reported.
</P>
<P>
"How wonderful it would be if, through my foundation, we could
help to increase the proportion of black and ethnic minority
practitioners in the field of architecture," Prince Charles said.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Lawrence was cruelly robbed of the chance to develop
his potential talents in the field of architecture.
</P>
<P>
Stephen, who was studying for his A-levels when he was
murdered by racists in April 1993, had always wanted to be an
architect. He was on a work placement with a firm of architects.
</P>
<P>
The prince expressed his "deepest sympathy" to Stephen's
parents who were present at the first Stephen Lawrence memorial
lecture in London.
</P>
<P>
"I wish them well in their quest to build something positive
from the shocking and sudden loss of their son Stephen," he said.
</P>
<P>
The memorial lecture will be an annual event aimed at
inspiring young black and Asian people.

<HEADLINE> U.S House Fails to Override Clinton Veto of Estate Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives failed Thursday to override President Bill Clinton
's veto of a bill repealing estate taxes, leaving the issue for
Republicans and Democrats to argue about in the fall election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
By a 274-157 vote, the Republican-controlled House fell 14
short of the necessary two-thirds margin of those voting to
override the veto of a bill, which was estimated to cost 105
billion U.S. dollars as it gradually phased out the tax over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Even though a clear House majority favored repeal and polls
show many Americans believe the tax is unfair, Democrats said just
as many people want Congress to focus on paying down public debt,
education and creating a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
Democrats also portrayed the bill as a giveaway to wealthy
families and only one part of a huge tax cut proposed by the
Republicans that would consume too much of the projected budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
The first 675,000 U.S. dollars of an estate is exempt from a
tax that reaches 55 percent, meaning only about 2 percent of
estates are affected each year. But the issue gained steam on
Capitol Hill this year amid a forceful lobbying campaign led by
the National Association of Manufacturers, American Farm Bureau
Federation and National Federation of Independent Business.
</P>
<P>
There have been nine previous attempts by Congress to override
a Clinton veto since Republicans took power in 1995. Four have won
House approval and only two, on budget line-item vetoes and
securities litigation reform, were overridden by the House and
Senate as required.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges U.N. to Reflect Will of All Peoples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said Thursday that
the United Nations should reflect the will of all member states so
as to be successful in countering challenges of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Millennium Summit which opened at the U.N.
headquarters in New York Wednesday, Tariq Aziz, deputy prime
minister of Iraq, said provisions of the U.N. Charter have
stipulated that the interest sought is common and collective
interest.
</P>
<P>
However, the most important fact of the past era was that the
ability to properly apply the provisions of the U.N. Charter is
not often possible due to the influences of the powerful states
that dominate international resolutions for their own interests,
the deputy prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"This situation was aggravated during the 1990s as a result of
the U.S. hegemony and domination on the international organization
for the benefit of its imperialist objectives," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the work of the United Nations in the 21st century
should be directed first towards resuming the proper application
of the charter and the prevention of hegemony on the U.N.
resolutions and positions," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The essential step in this move is to reform the decision-
making structures in the United Nations, particularly the Security
Council, so that it could really reflect the will of all member
states, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the United Nations, whose charter provided for the
protection of human rights, accepted to be a tool to violate the
fundamental human rights through the comprehensive and
unrestricted use of sanctions albeit the sufferings those
sanctions inflict upon the targeted people, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Iraq, the Iraqi victims of these unjust and
unrestricted sanctions amounted to more than 1 million of children,
women and elderly people during the past 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is not enough to only admit that sanctions are an inactive
tool that leads to counterproductive results and the use of
sanctions should be restricted and they should not trespass the
scope of the U.N. Charter, he noted.
</P>
<P>
They also should not be a hostage, as in the case of Iraq, of
the will of the United States of America which hijacked the
resolution on the lifting of sanctions on Iraq from the Security
Council in the service of its own interest and hostile politics,
Aziz added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said Iraq cautiously and dubiously
looks at the so-called humanitarian intervention since this call
may be used, and it has been actually used to interfere in the
internal affairs of other states by the influential states,
particularly the United States, he added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Won't Confirm Paratroops Moving to S.Leone: MoD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain Thursday declined to
comment on a report that a number of British paratroops had
arrived in Sierra Leone in an effort to free the six British
soldiers taken hostage by renegade militiamen in that Western
African country.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense (MoD) said it did not discuss
individual troop movements.
</P>
<P>
"Any movements are on a contingency basis so we're ready to
respond to any contingencies that might arise," a Reuters report
quoted an MoD spokesman as saying in London.
</P>
<P>
The BBC said on its website that reliable sources in Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone, had confirmed the arrival of fresh
British forces, including some with the distinctive red berets of
the paratroops who had been dispatched to Senegal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The key thing is that any movements don't imply any worsening
or any developments in the situation one way or the other. Our
priority remains to secure a peaceful resolution," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Eleven British soldiers, who were training a new Sierra Leonean
government army, were abducted by a band of former Sierra Leonean
troops called the West Side Boys on August 25.
</P>
<P>
The group freed five of them on August 30 after Britain agreed
to give them some military equipment and food.
</P>
<P>
The MoD spokesman said negotiations with the West Side Boys were
continuing.
</P>
<P>
"We're not commenting on any detail of any discussion. It wouldn
't be helpful in terms of what we're aiming to achieve," he said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets Estonian Parliament Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TALLINN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng
met with Estonian parliament speaker Toomas Savi here Thursday and
exchanged views with him on bilateral ties and regional and
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting between the two legislative leaders, Savi
said that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between
Estonia and China in 1991, the exchange of visits between
government and parliament officials and between business people of
the two countries increased rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement signed by Estonian President Lennart Meri
and Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing in 1994 when Meri was
visiting China formed the basis for further developing bilateral
ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng noted that Estonia is playing a more and more important
role in affairs of the Baltic region since its independence.
</P>
<P>
He also said China respects the choice made by the Estonian
people in trying to join the European Union. He reiterated China's
position that it is up to the people of a country to decide on
what kind of a social system to adopt and what kind of an approach
or model of development to choose.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader said China believes that a strong Europe is
conducive to the formation of a multi-polarized world and,
therefore, is conducive to world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed with each other that further efforts
should be made to increase exchanges and expand cooperation
between the legislative bodies, namely the National People's
Congress of China and the parliament of Estonia.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here Thursday afternoon on a three-day official
visit.

UNITED NATIONS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar said on
Thursday that it will not bow to harsh criticism at the United
Nations over its human rights record and pledged to purse its own
path of development without harming anyone or committing
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the three-day Millennium Summit which opened at the
U.N. headquarters in New York Wednesday, Foreign Minister U Win
Aung said the Myanmar government was taking a constructive path
while opposing forces that were embarking on a path to destruction.
</P>
<P>
"There is no single formula that could be applied to all
countries. It would be wrong for powerful countries to impose
their systems on others," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, let me once again reiterate that Myanmar is
building a genuine and durable democratic system in our own way
and yet there are some who would like to stir up the tranquil
waters," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Several world leaders at the summit criticized Myanmar for its
treatment of opposition leader Aung San Suu kyi.

<HEADLINE> Bush Presses for Military Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush focused on defense issues
for the second day Thursday, vowing to prepare the armed forces
for "Information Age battles."
</P>
<P>
In a speech in Dayton, Ohio, Texas Governor Bush promised a "
culture of innovation" in modernizing the military through
investment in technology.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who was accompanied by retired generals Colin Powell and
Norman Schwarzkopf, accused the Clinton administration of lagging
in "protecting ourselves and our allies from the new threats in
the world."
</P>
<P>
"I will have a culture of innovation," Bush said, adding that
if elected he would assign a task force to decide "how best to
spend our resources to redefine how war is fought and won."
</P>
<P>
Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, was also campaigning on
military modernization Thursday in South Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
The Texas governor Thursday described himself as the underdog
in the presidential race and pledged to change his campaign style
and strategy to revitalize his White House bid.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who was criticized by the local press for rejecting
presidential debates sponsored by the bipartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates, also appeared to reposition himself on the
debate issue.
</P>
<P>
"There will be debates, but what they look like and where they
are will be worked out in due course," he told reporters during a
campaign stop in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore continued
his focus on economic issues Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"What I am hearing is that the American people want to continue
our prosperity, but do even better," Gore said during a campaign
visit to Carbondale, Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his proposals to balance the budget, pay off the
national debt, as well as secure social security and Medicare.

<P>
The bank gave no immediate explanation for its decision. It
last raised the base rate in February from its previous level of 5.
75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decision was in line with analysts' expectations, given
growing evidence of a slowdown in the housing and retail markets
and mixed signs of recovery in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
U.K. interest rates are a half-point below those in the United
States but still above the 4.5 percent level seen in the euro zone,
where rates were increased last week to combat the threat of
inflation posed by the rise in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Bank's nine-strong Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) offers relief to Britain's exporters struggling
under the weight of a strong pound against the euro.
</P>
<P>
The MPC, which was only narrowly in favor of holding rates
steady at its August meeting, was faced with a range of
conflicting data on the state of the U.K. economy.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the decision, Martin Temple, head of the
Engineering Employers' Federation, said: "The MPC is clearly aware
of the continued pressure facing exporters from the strong pound."

<HEADLINE> Interpol Requests Eliminating Drug Trafficker's Bank Secrecy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 7 (Xinhua) -- International Police (
Interpol) asked Thursday for the elimination of banking secrecy of
drug traffickers, who earn yearly nearly 500 billion U.S. dollars
all over the world, within framework of the Sixth Cocaine Traffic
World Conference being held in Acapulco, southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Interpol Drug Unit Jean Michel Louboutin said
his organization backs up initiatives to eliminate banking secrecy
to combat these illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference that it's necessary to fight
criminal gangs that carry out financial operations with means
coming from drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 and at the beginning of year 2000, Interpol made a "
black list" of countries considered as "laundry" centers so that
other nations can investigate suspects better.
</P>
<P>
Louboutin said that Interpol is the first organization that has
created a permanent group of specialists and experts against
corruption in all aspects, but as this phenomenon is underground,
it's not easy to detect.
</P>
<P>
The Sixth World Conference on Cocaine Trafficking opened
Wednesday in the Mexican tourist port of Acapulco, 250 kilometers
south of Mexico City, with the attendance of delegates from 178
countries.

NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday expressed regret about a confrontation between officials
from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and U.S.
security personnel that led to the cancellation of the DPRK's
participation in the Millennium Summit, which kicked off Wednesday
at the U.N. headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
Clinton voiced his regret in his meeting with South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung at his hotel in downtown New York, where
the two presidents were meeting on the sidelines of the three-day
summit to discuss the U.N. role in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who met the South Korean president for an hour
Thursday morning, asked Kim for help smooth out "the hurt feelings
" in the DPRK, South Korean officials said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Clinton told Kim that the U.S. government "
tried every way possible" to get the DPRK delegation to New York
for the U.N. event but to no avail, the South Korean officials
said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean government sources said that the U.S. government
has also expressed regret over the incident in a formal letter to
the DPRK government.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he hopes the two sides on the Korean Peninsula
will continue their dialogue so as to realize an early
reunification of the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The head of the DPRK delegation to the Millennium Summit, Kim
Yong Nam, canceled his visit to New York Tuesday after he and
members of his delegation were forced to go through body search by
U.S. airport security personnel during a stopover at Frankfurt
airport in Germany.
</P>

<P>
Addressing the three-day Millennium Summit which opened at the
U.N. headquarters in New York, Thabo Mbeki, president of South
Africa, said the fundamental challenge that faces this summit is
that in a credible wary, the world leaders must show the will.
</P>

"We have to ensure that the poor play their role, not as
recipients of largesse and goodwill, but as co-determinants of
what happens to the common universe of which they are an important
part," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
"The essential question we have to answer at this summit is
whether we have the courage and the conscience to demonstrate that
we have the will to ensure that we permit no situation that will
deny any human community its dignity," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"Part of the naked truth is that the second millennium provided
humanity with the capital, technology and human skills to end
poverty and underdevelopment throughout the world," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
"Another part of that truth is that we have refused to use this
enormous capacity to end the contemporary, deliberate and savage
violence of poverty and underdevelopment," he said,

The summit should create the conditions to end this trend, the
president added.

<P>
Addressing the U.N. Millennium Summit which opened at the U.N.

of Singapore, said the world is becoming more globalized, yet at
the same time more fragmented.

While technological advances have brought the world closer,
they have also opened up divides between those who are able to
cope with the resultant challenges and those who lack the capacity

"We need to strengthen the United Nations to deal with these
new problems, as well as the stubborn old ones. We need to do so
because no nation can tackle these challenges alone," the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank and several other international institutions were created in
a different era to deal with different challenges, and they must
be updated," he said.
</P>

"Also today, there is an imperative for them to coordinate

<HEADLINE> Soprano Reaches Out of Court Settlement of Voice Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Julie Andrews, star of "
The Sound of Music," said Thursday that she has reached a
settlement of the medical malpractice lawsuit she filed relating
to a voice surgery.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement issued from both home here and New York,
the actress said she has settled this case "in a favorable manner"
and felt glad "to close this chapter on an event which is
unfortunate for all concerned." She also thanked her attorneys,
but did not disclose the terms of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
The British-born actress underwent a throat operation in 1997
in New York's Mt. Sinai Hospital to remove noncancerous throat
nodules. She was hoping the surgery would expedite her return to
the stage, but it resulted in her total disability of singing

<HEADLINE> Co-Chairmen of U.N. Summit Hails Inter-Korean Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a statement issued here Thursday, the co-chairmen of the
Millennium Summit and the United Nations General Assembly,
presidents of Finland and Namibia, said that they welcome the
summit meeting held in Pyongyang in June this year between the
leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and
the Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
They also welcomed the Inter-Korean Joint Declaration "as a
major breakthrough in bringing peace, stability and reunification
to the Korean Peninsula," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
They encouraged the two parties "to advance the process of
dialogue so that it may eventually lead to the peaceful
reunification of the peninsula while contributing to the peace and
security of the region and beyond," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The summit between Kim Jong Il, chairman of DPRK's National
Defense Commission, and Kim Dae-jung, president of ROK, has
smoothly concluded in June in Pyongyang, thanks to the concerted
efforts of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Kim Yong Nam, head of the DPRK delegation to the Millennium
Summit, canceled his visit to New York Tuesday after he and
members of his delegation were forced to go through body search by
U.S. airport security personnel during a stopover at the Frankfurt
airport in Germany.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, in his Thursday meeting with the
South Korean president, voiced regret about a confrontation at the
Frankfurt airport that led to the cancellation of the DPRK's
participation in the Millennium Summit, which began Wednesday at
the U.N. headquarters in New York.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chips Fall But Tech Stocks Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed Thursday with blue chips falling on corporate profit
warnings, but the tech stocks bounced back from a selloff in the
previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
50.77 at 11,259.87 points, ending a rally in the past four
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 85.01 at 4,098.35 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.26 at 1,502.51.
</P>
<P>
Blue chip stocks fell as several companies warned separately
that their earnings would not meet expectations in the third
quarter because of higher costs and lower demands in the slowing
economy. Among them were DuPont, Campbell Soup, Circuit City
Stores and May Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
The warnings came after the Federal Reserve had raised interest
rates for six times since last summer in an effort to slow the U.
S. economy and keep inflation under control. Higher rates would
hit companies in earnings.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking also dragged the Dow index lower. Investors took
some money out of the market to lock in profits from a previous
rally.
</P>
<P>
But the tech shares came back after a deep falling Wednesday
and Tuesday. The Nasdaq index fell 220.99 points in the previous
two sessions after analyst downgrades of several prominent tech
companies including Intel and Micron Technology.
</P>
<P>
Chip makers Intel and Micron Technology rose Thursday after
sufferings. Sun Microsystems also moved up, recovering nearly all
of its loss Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 1.03 at 675.49 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 3.03 at 974.18. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies was up 6.50 at 542.82.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,556 up, 1,306 down and 516
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 973.54 million shares from 992.42
million in the previous session.
