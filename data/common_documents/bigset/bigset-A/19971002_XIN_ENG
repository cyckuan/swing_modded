<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 1 (xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe
Liu Guijin held a reception here this afternoon to celebrate the
48th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to some 300 Tanzanians and foreign diplomats
attending the reception, Liu Guijin said two major historic
events took place in China this year and these have brought
special significance to the National Day celebrations this time.
</P>
<P>
On July 1st, China resumed exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong after the region had been under British rule for over 150
years, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
And last month, the Communist Party of China successfully
convened its 15th congress, which laid down guidelines for China
to enter the 21st century by holding high the great banner of
Deng Xiaoping theory for building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the guests on the achievements after China
adopted reform and opening policies in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
In a toast, Zimbabwe's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs
Nicholas Goche conveyed to the Chinese government and people
congratulations and best wishes from the Zimbabwean government
and people.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his government's satisfaction with the existing
friendship and cooperation between the two countries and peoples.
</P>
<P>
Goche said he hoped the two sides would explore other avenues
to further promote bilateral technical cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
The reception attracted more than 300 government officials,
foreign diplomats and Zimbabwean friends from various walks of
life, as well as Chinese working and living in the country.

<HEADLINE> Experts Invited to Give Consultation on Locking of Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The China Yangtze River Three
Gorges Development Project Corp. invited 22 noted Chinese water
conservancy and hydropower experts to act as consultants for the
project to dam the Yangtze River in early November.
</P>
<P>
The construction schedule calls for the Three Gorges Dam to be
isolated from the main stream of the Yangtze River, China's
longest river, between November 6-8.
</P>
<P>
The group of experts recently visited the construction site in
central China's Hubei Province to inspect preparatory work and
offer suggestions for a revised construction plan. The experts
took part in in-depth discussions concerning the possibility of
technical problems related to the damming of the Yangtze and the
second-phase construction of cofferdams.
</P>
<P>
The experts pointed to the fact the developer is
technically prepared to ensure the successful damming of the river.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Dam is considered to be one of the world's
most complex projects in terms of difficulty in damming and for
technology needed to complete the dam.
</P>
<P>
Years of extensive research have enabled China to resolve all
major technical problems involved damming the Yangtze. The
development corporation has completed repeated successful
experiments simulating the damming effort.

<HEADLINE> Blast Kills Three in Philippine Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and an
undetermined number of others injured this evening by a grenade
explosion in a crowded Catholic church in the Philippine capital
area of Metro Manila, police said.
</P>
<P>
The three victim were initially seriously wounded when an
unidentified man threw two fragmentation grenades into a crowd of
prayers inside Baclaran Catholic Church in Pasay city, Metro
Manila at 8:45 p.m., said a policeman from the Baranaque Police
District.
</P>
<P>
They died later in hospital, said the policeman who asked to be
anonymous.
</P>
<P>
The blast was widely believed to be in retaliation for the
leading role played by the Catholic Church in the September 21
mass rally against changes to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Actually, an explosive device had been found by police inside
the church after the church received a bomb threat just one day
before the rally.
</P>
<P>
In mid-September, two explosions occurred in the capital area,
killing six people and wounding 60 others. Later, a shadowy
military claimed responsibility for the bombings and threatened
more bombings if the opposition to charter change persisted.
</P>
<P>
Since then, a wave of bomb threats swept private and public
offices, including Catholic churches and even the Supreme Court,
in Metro Manila. But most of them were found to be hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, Philippine President Fidel Ramos can
only serve single six-year term, and must step down in June 1998.
But his supporters have been pushing hard for constitutional
changes to remove the term limit for the president.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who has been accused by his critics of being behind the
drive to amend the charter, made it clear that he would not seek
another term, in a statement issued just several hours before the
September 21 rally.
</P>
<P>
The anti-charter change rally was led by Manila Archbishop
Jaime Cardinal Sin and former president Corazon Aquino.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Seek Comprehensive and Just Peace: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat said today that the Palestinians are seeking comprehensive,
just and lasting peace along all the Arab tracks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to newsmen following his meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Egyptian port city of Alexandria,
Arafat said that he discussed with Mubarak the current
circumstances, challenges and difficulties facing the Arab nation,
particularly the Palestinian people, as a result of Israel's
failure to fulfill the agreements already approved by the
concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
According to the Middle East News Agency, Arafat criticized
Israel's attempts to evade its obligations regarding the release
of detainees as well as the full and honest implementation of the
agreement of Israeli troop withdrawal and redeployment in the
Palestinian territories. He also denounced Israeli designs to
Judaize Jerusalem and to confiscate Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also pointed out that Israel was delaying the opening of
the Gaza airport, refusing to permit the construction of the Gaza
harbor, obstructing the opening of the safe passage between the
West Bank and Gaza and failing to honor the dues which already
reached 34 cases.
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of the current New York tripartite meeting
between U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levi and the Secretary General of the
Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization
Mahmoud Abbas (alias Abu Mazen), Arafat said "we have to wait and
see."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Arafat left Alexandria this afternoon
after a brief stay of a few hours in the city.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had already visited Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco
before arriving in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Most Canadians Back New Unity Initiative, Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A majority of Canadians support
the new national unity initiative proposed in Calgary last month,
according to a new poll published today.
</P>
<P>
However, they don't think the Calgary accord will make much
difference in terms of keeping the French-speaking Province of
Quebec in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The accord, reached last month in Calgary by all provincial
premiers, excluding Quebec premier, and two territorial leaders,
affirmed Quebec's "unique character" while stressing the
principles of equality of all Canadians and provinces.
</P>
<P>
The province has been seeking independence from Canada since a
near victory for separatists in a 1995 independence referendum.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 70 percent of those surveyed regard the
accord as a step in the right direction, while 24 percent say it
was a mistake for the premiers to reopen the national unity issue.
</P>
<P>
In Quebec, 62 percent of respondents say the accord is a right
step, while 32 percent regard it as a mistake.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 57 percent of Canadians think the efforts by the
premiers, backed by Prime Minister Jean Chretien, will have no
real impact on the possibility of Quebec's stay or separation.
</P>
<P>
Within Quebec, a slim majority say the accord does not alter
their view on the province's future course.
</P>
<P>
Chretien, a French-speaking Quebecker who has worked tirelessly
to keep Canada united, said the premiers demonstrated responsible
leadership.
</P>
<P>
The poll by Angus Reid Group is the first national poll on
attitudes toward the Calgary accord.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 1,500 Canadians was taken on September 23-30 and
is considered accurate within 2.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Cultural Show Staged in HK to Mark National Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A cultural show staged today
at Hong Kong Coliseum to mark the National Day of China climaxed
when Singing the Motherland was being chorused by over 1,000
singers.
</P>
<P>
The banner reading Long Live the Motherland was seen high on
the stage when the chorus was echoed in the famous performing
venue.
</P>
<P>
The performance is one of some 130 commemorations throughout
Hong Kong to celebrate the 48th anniversary of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Association of Compatriots in Hong Kong for
Celebration of the National Day, the show featured songs and
dances, cross-talk and acrobatics, with performers, totaling
1,500, coming from Hong Kong and China's interior areas.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the show, 60 white-uniformed members from
the Hong Kong Police Band played the National Anthem, while a huge
five-star red flag was raised on the backdrop of the stage.
</P>
<P>
An amateur troupe from the People's Liberation Army's Hong Kong
Garrison made their debut in the evening, with their song and
dance "Being A Soldier in Hong Kong" greeted by thundering
clappings.
</P>
<P>
Other programs include folk songs of China's minorities, pop
songs, ballet, modern dance as well as breath-taking acrobatics by
a group of children aged between 10 and 15 from China's interior.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, a line-up of senior government
officials and a host of local prestigious figures were among
thousands of audience at the two-hour show.
</P>
<P>
Henry Fok Ying-tung, vice chairman of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, addressed the show on behalf of
the association. "We are so proud to brace the first National Day
after Hong Kong's reunification with the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon of the day, recreation and sports carnivals
were held in Victoria Park on Hong Kong Island and Sha Tin Sports
Ground, "the New Territories".
</P>
<P>
The carnival in Victoria Park, organized by the Provisional
Urban Council, featured various sports and games, including
traditional Chinese fun games like bowl-balancing and stilts. A
stage show produced by a local radio featuring popular singers
attracted a lot of fans.
</P>
<P>
At Sha Tin Sports Ground, some 600 students joined hands in
forming a giant map of China about the size of a soccer pitch. The
map, which contains heart-shaped wooden blocks with small balloons
and decorations on top, may help the youngsters get a better idea
of the shape of their motherland and the location of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The celebration, organized by the Provisional Regional Council,
also included Chinese traditional dances, gymnastic performances,
singing and colorful recreational and sports activities.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, Hong Kong people
now can enjoy two-day public holidays celebrating the National
Day, like their compatriots in China's interior areas.
</P>
<P>
It was the fireworks display over Victoria Harbor that drew a
perfect ending to the whole day's celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong people, especially kids, felt lucky enough to watch
the sixth fireworks display in the year of handover. On waterfront
across the harbor, families, lovers and friends were seen
everywhere crazy for the 23-minute extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
Police estimated that some 500,000 people feasted their eyes on
both sides of the harbor, while more watching from TV.
</P>
<P>
It was also the first time for them to enjoy fireworks on the
National Day. Traditionally, fireworks are only displayed on the
second day of the lunar new year.
</P>
<P>
The display was sponsored by the Federation of Hong Kong
Guangdong Community Organizations and fireworks were all made in
the Chinese interior.

<HEADLINE> Russia Accuses US of Interfering in Gas Deal with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today accused the United States of trying to interfere with the
implementation of a natural gas deal signed between Iran and two
companies in France and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told reporters that both Russia and France are
independent states and whether they should or should not sign a
contract with somebody else was no business of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The French oil company Total on Sunday announced a two billion
U.S. dollar contract for exploration in Iran's South pars offshore
gas field along with its Russian partner, Russian Natural Gas
Monopoly (the GAZPROM).
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. called the contract a violation of its
Iran-Libya sanctions act, also called the D'Amato Act, and
threatened to impose sanctions upon Iran and the two companies.
</P>
<P>
The act bans all companies throughout the world from investing
more than 40 million dollars in the oil and hydrocarbon sector of
Iran and Libya, which Washington has accused of backing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin noted that Russia would not give up the contract under
pressure imposed by the U.S. He also expressed thanks to his
French counterpart, Jacques Chirac, who held the same view.

<HEADLINE>   Roundup:  Thai Cabinet Scraps Hopewell Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is the first major infrastructure setback for Thailand since
the de facto devaluation of the baht on July 2.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years of construction, progress on the
project, the Bangkok elevated road and train system, has been
slow, with only about 14 percent of the work done so far.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Hopewell (Thailand), a subsidiary of Hong
Kong-based Hopewell Holdings, and the Thai side have often openly
blamed each other for delays and lack of fund.
</P>
<P>
The multi-deck mass transit system, planned to complete within
eight years, was plagued by contractual disputes and technical
problems, including disagreements on the extension of the
concession period, payment of concession fee, connection with
expressways and fare structures.
</P>
<P>
Anusak Intharapuvasa, Hopewell (Thailand) vice chairman, said
his firm had liquidity problems because the Thai government's
decision to float the currency, which reduced the project's
expected return by 40 percent and prompted financial institutions
to suspend their plans to fund the project.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the project, estimated at 80 billion baht (3
billion U.S. dollars) at the time when the contract was signed,
would now exceed 4 billion U.S. dollars, as a result of the
depreciation of the Thai currency and economic slump.
</P>
<P>
Some academic sources said that the contract was signed even
before feasibility studies were completed.
</P>
<P>
The project consists of elevated trains, elevated tollways,
frontage roads and property development along its routes, most of
the routes were to run above the railway tracks in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The contract, signed on November 9, 1990, awarded Hopewell a
30-year concession plus eight years of construction. Hopewell was
given the right to develop 100 hectares of land commercially along
the routes and in some residential areas.
</P>
<P>
However, the current slump in the property sector and overall
economic downturn put the project in trouble.
</P>
<P>
Now Hopewell has the right to seek compensation for the 12
billion baht (333 million dollars) it has invested in the project,
while the Thai government also has a right for compensation for
the delay.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government will now inform Hopewell of its decision
and explain its reasons. If Hopewell does not accept the Thai
positions, the dispute must be submitted for arbitration, if
arbitration cannot settle the dispute, the two sides will have to
seek a court ruling, a process which could take as long as 10
years to complete.
</P>
<P>
Without the multi-deck project, the 13th Asian Games would not
be affected, because the construction of an alternative tollway
and a Bangkok outer ring road are under way, according to
Transport and Communications Minister Suwat Liptapallop.

<HEADLINE> US Construction Spending Declines in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Construction spending in the
U.S. declined by 0.3 percent in August, the third drop in the past
four months, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the spending dropped to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 601.8 billion dollars in the month after a
1.6 percent increase to a record high in July.
</P>
<P>
The July's figure, which had previously been reported as a 0.5
percent gain, was revised upwards in the report.
</P>
<P>
The weakness of U.S. construction spending in August was led by
a 1 percent drop in government construction to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 137.6 billion dollars. There were
downturns of spending on schools, highways and streets and water
supply facilities.
</P>
<P>
Residential construction rose by 0.2 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 260 billion dollars. But single-family
construction slipped 0.1 percent while apartment building and
remodeling projects increased.
</P>
<P>
Non-residential commercial construction fell 0.8 percent to an
annual rate of 163.9 billion dollars. Gains in hotels, private
schools and hospitals were more than offset by drops in
construction of factories, offices and retail stores.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today urged the legislators to pass a congressional resolution to
ensure the speedy return of former President Ferdinand Marcos'
assets in Swiss banks to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
During the 77th meeting of the Legislative-Executive
Development Advisory Council, Ramos reiterated the government
objective to get the Marcos wealth transferred from the Swiss
banks to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He later stressed at his weekly press briefing that the
government has always been supportive of the claims of the 10,000
victims of human rights abuses during the Marcos time that they
should get compensation from Marcos' assets.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also laughed off as sheer fantasy the claim that there
are 1,241 tons of Marcos' gold deposited in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
"I was told that if all of the gold extracted from all of the
mines in the world over the last 25 years were put together in one
place, they wouldn't amount to 1,240 tons. Now, in my own
estimation what is 1,241 tons? That is more than 600 six-by-six
trucks loaded with gold of two tons each," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new controversy of Marcos' gold has resurfaced following
the allegation by American lawyer Swift who is a counsel for the
victims of human rights abuses. Swift said that there are 1,241
tons of gold owned by Marcos deposited in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
Swift also said a "memorandum of account" owned by Ramos
showed a secret deal on the Marcos wealth deposited in Swiss
banks.
</P>
<P>
Ramos Tuesday vehemently dismissed claims by Swift that he has
transferred some of the fabled Marcos gold to a bank account in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Ramos denied he has a bank deposit in Switzerland. He admitted
he had an American dollar account "many years ago which I closed
even before I became President on June 30, 1992."

<P>
HARARE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Now that Africa's proposal to
secure two seats with a veto power on the U.N. Security Council
has been agreed on, it is now up to the continent to decide on
the countries to represent it, a zimbabwean official said today.
</P>
<P>
Briefing journalists at the end of President Robert Mugabe's
visit to the 52nd UN general assembly in New York, Foreign
Minister Stan Mudenge said although U.S. President Bill Clinton
agreed to changes in the UN Security Council, he felt it was the
responsibility of the continent to come up with their choices.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the two seats for Africa were in line with the
geographical representation in Africa.
</P>
<P>
''The U.N. reforms must now reflect the new economic order and
changes and not seek to maintain the status quo of the second
World War era,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the Organization of African Unity also welcome
the proposed U.N. reforms spelt out by U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan, but added that U.N. reforms for Africa would be
negotiated by African member states.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- People of all ethnic groups
across China today celebrated the 48th founding anniversary of the
People's Republic with flag-raising ceremonies and a variety of
festivities.
</P>
<P>
Some 260,000 people gathered at Tiananmen Square in Beijing to
see the daily flag-raising ceremony held at the crack of
dawn. Deafening applause burst from the crowd when the Five-Star
Red Flag reached the top of the mast within about two minutes.
</P>
<P>
Liu Kuiji, a wartime hero in his 70s, said this was the fifth
time since 1950 that he has watched the solemn National Day
ceremony on the square.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited. This National Day came right after the 15th
National Party Congress, which has opened a new chapter for the
history of the motherland," the revolutionary veteran said.
</P>
<P>
Ma Fengliang, a young man of Hui ethnic group, one of China's
ethnic minorities, came to the capital from the remote
northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"The national flag makes all of us in the square that our
hearts are connected," he said. "And I can feel more acutely the
warmth of the big family of our motherland."
</P>
<P>
A young man from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), founded on July 1 this year, said that watching the
flag-raising on the first National Day since Hong Kong's return to
its motherland would be the most cherished memory of his life.

<HEADLINE> Shell Canada to Invest Heavily in Oilsands Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Shell Canada Ltd. has unveiled
plans for the development of a 1.3 billion U.S. dollar bitumen
upgrader at its refinery near Edmonton, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
The upgrader will only be built if the Calgary-based company
receives green light to develop a new 720 million dollar oilsands
mine and extraction plant in the province, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Bitumen is the tar-like substance that is recovered from the
oilsands.
</P>
<P>
It would be moved by a proposed pipeline to the Edmonton
upgrader, the third and final piece of the company's huge
integrated oilsands development.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed integrated oilsands development would more than
double the size of Shell Canada's current oil-and-gas business,"
the company said.
</P>
<P>
The company currently produces 90,000 barrels a day of
conventional oil and 730 million cubic feet a day of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Shell is one of the largest integrated petroleum companies in
Canada, with a total annual revenues of 3.7 billion dollars and
assets of more than 3.6 billion dollars.

A theatrical show held in Urumqi, capital city of the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, was well-received with laughter and
applause. Troupes of farmers and herdsmen from nine ethnic groups,
including Uighur, Hui and Kazak ethnic groups, spent nine months
rehearsing the show.
</P>
<P>
In Kunming, capital city of southwest China's Yunnan province,
orchestral performances and other shows were also held to

</P>
<P>
In Lhasa, capital city of the Tibet Autonomous Region, flags
are soaring over government buildings, and marketplaces are filled
with people buying goods. The city's residents, who are fond of
spending holidays in the open air, put up tents on the outskirts
of Lhasa, and sang and danced in the autumn sunshine.
</P>
<P>
Museums in the port city of Tianjin, north China, hosted
exhibitions to highlight the country's progress over the past
years.
</P>
<P>
Some cities celebrated the day by demonstrating their
achievements in economic development. Nanjing of Jiangsu province
has seen sharply increased foreign investments in this east China
city, and a number of state-owned enterprises in northeast
provinces are reported to have been revived.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output in northeast China's Liaoning province
increased by 9.2 percent in the first eight months of this year to
reach 137.1 billion yuan (16.5 billion US dollars) over the same
period of last year. And more foreign investments have been
pouring into the province.
</P>
<P>
In a small village near Guiyang, capital of southwest China's
Guizhou province, villagers from the Miao ethnic minority dressed
in their traditional festival costumes and danced into new
houses. The village was affected by heavy flooding last year, but
new houses have been built with the help of local government
funding.

Many Chinese people marked National Day by studying the report
of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
In Jinan, capital of east China's Shandong province, officers
of the People's Liberation Army of the Jian Military Area Command
and officials of the provincial and municipal government held a
forum to study the guidelines of the congress.
</P>
<P>
They vowed to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory and rally closely around the CPC Central Committee with
Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin at its core.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yihua, general manager of a shareholding company in
Shijiazhuang, capital of the north China province of Hebei, said
that "the congress's report confirmed that the shareholding system
is an effective way to realize the public ownership. This has
greatly inspired our staff members who have decided to seize the
opportunity to turn our company into a bigger one."
</P>
<P>
Lu was a delegate to the recent 15th CPC National Congress.
</P>
<P>
In the northwestern province of Shanxi, government officials
visited factories and villages to express their solicitude for
workers and farmers. In the northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, officials and ordinary people thoroughly reviewed the
report.
</P>
<P>
While many Chinese people have four days holiday at National

</P>
<P>
At the Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation, workers are busy in
front of the blast furnaces. An ironworks turned out 22,763 tons

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Falls to New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso today fell
sharply, with its exchange rate against the U.S. dollar breaching
the so-called psychological level of 35 pesos at the local
currency market.
</P>
<P>
The local currency fell to as low as 35.61 pesos to the dollar
at the early trading in the Philippine Dealing System (PDS), the
country's computerized currency exchange system.
</P>
<P>
On the average, the peso was trading at 34.926 pesos to the
dollar at the PDS, 1.8 percent lower than Wednesday's 34.295
pesos.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the sharp depreciation of the peso to rising
demand for the dollar from investors who are losing confidence in
the peso and other Southeast Asian currencies and unloading them.
</P>
<P>
Currency experts said as long as other Southeast Asian
currencies fail to recover, it will be hard for the peso to
rebound.
</P>
<P>
The peso has already depreciated more than 31 percent since it
was allowed to float on July 11 in the face of fierce speculative
attacks against the currency.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Central Bank today refrained from actively
intervening in the local currency market under the policy of
preserving its limited foreign reserves of about 10.6 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank raised its offer rate for the dollar to
35.70 pesos from 34.96 pesos for Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes Shut Down of Bosnia Transmitters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
expressed its endorsement to the action by NATO-led Salvation
Forces (SFOR) to shut down four television and radio transmitters
in the Republic Srpska, Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR troops raided and closed the transmitter stations
early today as it is alleged that the Bosnian Serb transmitters
have been used by those people loyal to former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic to denounce NATO and the Bosnian Peace Accords.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office said in a statement issued this
afternoon that the London government "welcomes this morning's
decisive action by SFOR troops against four radio and TV
transmitters in Republic Srpska."
</P>
<P>
"Contact Group foreign ministers last week reaffirmed the right
of the (Bosnia) High Representative (Carlos Westendorp) to curtail
or suspend any media network or program whose output is in
persistent and blatant contravention of the (Bosnia) Peace
Agreement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore fully support Carlos Westendorp's decision to
request military action against stations which undermine Dayton
(Agreement) not least by expressing support to Karadzic," it
added.

<HEADLINE> Six Nepali Government Officials Tender Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Six ministers and state
ministers tendered their resignations to Nepali Prime Minister
Lokendra Bahadur Chand Wednesday just one day before the Lower
House is to debate on the no-confidence motion against the
government tabled by the main opposition Nepali Congress (NC).
</P>
<P>
Among the six ministers are Finance Minister Rabindra Nath
Sharma, Commerce Minister Sarbendra Nath Shukla and Minister for
Land Reforms and Management Buddhiman Tamang, all of them come
from Chand's own National Democratic Party (RPP), an informed
source said.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Chand will not accept these resignations at
this crucial moment, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Since the NC registered the no-confidence motion against the
present three-party government on September 22, a new round of
political drama has been unfolding in this Himalayan country.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the motion was registered in the Parliament
Secretariat, Prime Minister Chand effected a sixth change to his
cabinet since taking office in March, inducting three independents
as ministers and changing some portfolios.
</P>
<P>
But the next day, Gajendra Narayan Singh, who was transferred
from minister for supplies to minister without portfolio,
resigned.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Singh's resignation, the Nepal Sadbhavana
(goodwill) Party, a coalition partner, accused Prime Minister
Chand of turning a blind eye to the problems of the Terai people
and of hurting the party's feelings by stripping its only minister
of his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Then on September 30, Minister of Supplies Moti Prasad Pahadi
who at first declined to take oath of office also resigned barely
four days after taking office.
</P>
<P>
The Lower House is set to debate on the no-confidence motion
from October 2 to 4 and vote on it on October 5 or 6.
</P>
<P>
While a total of 86 MPs from the NC had signed the
no-confidence motion, a simple majority of 103 votes is needed to
pass the motion in the 205-seat Lower House.
</P>
<P>
RPP President Surya Bahadur Thapa, Chand's arch rival, has not
made known his stand on the motion until now.
</P>
<P>
The RPP, which has 20 seats in the Lower House, is divided into
Thapa faction and Chand faction.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist,
CPN-UML), has asked all its 89 MPs to vote against the
no-confidence motion.

<HEADLINE> Fight Against Regional Crime Needed Coop: Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- There is need for increased
regional and international cooperation if governments are to
combat crime successfully, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said today.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Interpol Sub-Regional Bureau for Southern Africa
here, Mugabe said, "if we demonstrate solidarity in our resolute
fight against crimes without the impediment of territorial
barriers, would-be criminals will become acutely aware that the
police organization of the world is collectively ranged against
them and that no country will provide refuge to fugitives."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said by providing premises for the sub-regional office,
the Zimbabwean government had shown commitment to the fight
against crime.
</P>
<P>
He urged other countries to contribute toward meeting the
costs of running the office.
</P>
<P>
The bureau is a regional facility whose major purpose is to
enable southern African countries to formulate and coordinate
joint strategies for the control and combat of cross border
crime.
</P>
<P>
"It is, therefore, imperative that member countries view it as
such in order to derive maximum benefit from its programs and
activities," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe commended the signing earlier of an agreement on
cooperation by member countries of the Southern African Regional
Cooperation Police Chiefs Organization (SARPCCO), saying this
would complement interpol's efforts in fighting crime in the
region.
</P>
<P>
However, Mugabe said to sustain these regional initiatives, it
was important that effective training programs were developed to
ensure that police in the region did not lag behind in the
international standards of investigating, detecting and
preventing crime.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Asks UN to Reexamine Cambodia's Seat Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian leader Hun Sen
is threatening to limit the United Nations' role in the scheduled
election of his country next May if the Organization does not give
his government Cambodia's seat in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen met with U.S. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Tuesday
evening to mainly discuss the issue of Cambodia's seat in the
world body.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodia's seat was declared vacant last month after the
United Nations tried but failed to preserve it for Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, the first Prime Minister of Cambodia, who was ousted in
July.
</P>
<P>
"It is the seat that belong to us and we have the right to
occupy it," Hun Sen told reporters after the meeting with the U.N.
head.
</P>
<P>
"If the issue of the seat of Cambodia cannot be resolved, we
will look into the matter" of the U.N. role in the elections, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen expressed hope that the members of the U.N. credentials
committee will re-examine their positions.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night,Annan also met with Ranariddh in an effort to
persuade the two rivals of Cambodia to negotiate a peaceful
solution to the conflict and hold the election freely and fairly.
</P>
<P>
But the two Cambodians showed no sign of reconciliation. Hun
Sen said that during his stay in New York he had no reason to meet
Ranariddh as the latter had suggested earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen added that Ranariddh, who won the 1993 U.N.-supervised
election, was welcome to go back to Cambodia. But he refused to
guarantee Ranariddh's immunity from criminal charges.

<HEADLINE> No Big Troop Reduction of SFOR in Bosnia: NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAASTRICHT, Netherlands, October 1 (Xinhua) -- NATO defense
ministers today agreed that there will be no significant troop
reduction of the multinational SFOR force in Bosnia in the run-up
to next June.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers were overwhelmed with the feeling that
SFOR should stay in Bosnia even after the local municipal
elections, not as otherwise required by the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
No minister, according to sources close to the annual informal
meeting, called for large reduction of troops between now and next
June when the SFOR mandate comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
It is because NATO credibility is too tied up to Bosnia to
afford a slip over the peacemaking mission. If the mission in
Bosnia should fail, it would be too difficult for the enlarging
military alliance to carry out future operations, the sources said
after the ministerial discussion.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers also agreed that what SFOR could not
achieve now with 36,000 troops cannot be achieved in the future
with less troops.
</P>
<P>
"The more we can do now, the easier the situation will be next
year," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A post-SFOR force cannot afford to be a reduced duplicate of
the present SFOR, the sources said. It has to be completely
redefined and constructed for a completely new mission with
different structure, mandate and relationship.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana told a press briefing that
the ministers had agreed NATO has to continue with the same
robustness and even-handedness in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief added that the SFOR mission will only terminate
at a time when a security framework has been set up in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht informal meeting gave NATO policy planners a
chance to compare notes on political views. They reached
consensus that SFOR has to remain in Bosnia for the coming
parliamentary elections slated for October 23.
</P>
<P>
NATO is expecting the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe to call upon its troops to help secure the elections
just as they did in the September 13-14 Bosnian municipal
elections.
</P>
<P>
A few defense ministers, however, said that SFOR should be able
to shed some of its troops without decisively reducing the
strength of the multinational force.
</P>
<P>
The three options of no reduction, small reduction and large
reduction will remain on table for the scheduled November and
December meetings of NATO defense ministers who prefer to see an
overall plan for not simply reducing the number of troops but
rather a plan for reconfiguring the troops to remain in Bosnia as
an effective deterrance.

<HEADLINE> Cases of Cancer Rise Sharply in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Cases of cancer in Britain have
increased sharply over a 12-year period, with the figures for
women up 20 percent and for men 10 percent higher, according to an
annual medical report of the nation today.
</P>
<P>
Chief medical officer Kenneth Calman said in the report that as
a result of an increase in the number of women smokers, lung
cancer had overtaken breast cancer as the main cause of cancer
deaths among women in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The report said that malignant melanoma, skin cancer had shown
the biggest single increase among cancers while prostate cancer
had increased by about 40 percent since 1979.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that prostate cancer could take over from
colorectal cancer as the second most common cancer in men if the
current trends continued.
</P>
<P>
However, death rates from heart disease and stroke were falling
and infant mortality reached its lowest ever rate last year, six
deaths per 1,000 live births. Life expectancy has increased to
79.5 years for women and 74.3 percent for men.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Calls on to Strengthen Development Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- In a world of
ever-deepened interindependence and under the impact of
globalization trends, the need for development cooperation was
becoming increasing strong, Vu Khoan, Deputy Minister for Foreign
Affairs of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly,
the deputy foreign minister said nations were facing unprecedented
opportunities for expanding market, engaging more
partners,intensifying investment and technology transfers in order
to attain a higher growth.
</P>
<P>
Vu said that there was the process of liberalization which had
made competition extremely acute, and in that competition the
advantages did not go to countries which were still at a low level
of economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the gap between the rich and the poor countries
was widening, thus causing great losses to developing nations. The
ratio of GDP per capita between the rich and the poor had gone up
to 61/1 in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Vu stressed that it was necessary to reverse the trend of
decreasing of the Official Development Aid both bilaterally and
multilaterally, at the time when developing countries badly needed
capital for infrastructure, construction, human resource
development, life-quality improvement, poverty alleviation,
eco-system and environment protection and so forth to address the
global issues facing every country, developed as well as
developing.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister said his country was looking
forward to stronger technology transfers as the outstanding and
rapid scientific and technological progress were posing a danger
of developing countries being left further behind.
</P>
<P>
Vu said it was high time to completely do away with the
obsolete ways of thinking and acting of the past, namely the
imposition of inequitable terms of economic and trade relations,
sanctions and embargoes.

<HEADLINE> Mogadishu's Water System to Be Rehabilitated in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 1 (Xinhua) -- In just six months' time,
water will run again into the Somali capital Mogadishu, a German
aid agency announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The agency, German Diakonie Bread for the World (DBG), said
with funds from the German government, the main engines of the 32
water wells in Afgoie, about 18 km South of the capital, will be
repaired so as to supply clean water to the capital at low cost.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today, the director of DBG,
Dietrich Frenkel, said that the spare parts will reach Mogadishu
within a month and once the repairs are done, the flow of water
will start.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel said his agency will also finance the repair works and
the building of the infrastructure of the distribution points.
</P>
<P>
The water project which will cost more than 0.5 million U.S.
Dollars has been Welcomed and supported by Mogadishu's main
political sides, according to Mr Frenkel, who said that "they
guaranteed the security and pledged not to impose taxes on the
transactions of the water project."
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu's water system will be privatized for the first time
and will become self sustaining project in six weeks time after
it starts running. "The water wells and their distribution system
will be run by Somalis who are independent from us and the
political factions," said Mr Frenkel.
</P>
<P>
The Afgoie water wells which were built also by a German
agency. Saarberg Interplan in 1982 remains one of the few
national assets that survived the destruction of the civil war
and subsequent widespread looting.
</P>
<P>
Four of the 12 heavy duty engines are to be repaired by DBG so
that two can operate alternatively at a time.
</P>
<P>
DBG has commended a group of Somalis who protected the well
fields throughout the civil war. Frenkel said, "I couldn't
believe my eyes when I saw some of the engines were even brand
new, still wrapped in their cartons."
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu's water system has been out of order since the
departure of the United Nations peace keepers from Somalia in
early March 1995.
</P>
<P>
Many of the pipe line installations of the city were also dug
out by looters. So the task of restoring Mogadishu's water system
will delight the people of the capital who have been drinking
unsafe water from unhygienic shallow wells.

responsible for police matters today signed an agreement covering
cooperation and mutual assistance in combating crimes.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said in a communique issued here after the
signing ceremony that the accord was designed to lay a sound
basis and legal framework for regional police cooperation in
fighting cross border crime in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement will immeasurably strengthen the efforts of the
southern African regional cooperation police chiefs organization
and also the function of the Interpol Southern Africa Bureau in
developing effective crime combating strategies," the ministers
said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers from Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,

Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe signed the pact which now awaits
ratification.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, police officials may enter into any member

laws of the country visited and approval from officials in charge
of a central office which transmits and receives requests for the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Police in the hosting country would provide assistance to
their visiting counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Areas of specific cooperation under the agreement are the
exchange of crime related information and technical expertise on
a regular basis, and the planning, coordination and execution of
joint operations including under-cover operations.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russia Not to Itemize Military Cooperation Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAASTRICHT, Netherlands, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia today failed to come out
with a detailed plan for their pronounced military-to-military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the first meeting between the NATO chief and the
new Russian defense minister, neither side could categorize what
their cooperation plans contain.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, however, described as
very good his meeting with Igor Sergeyev, the former commander of
the strategic missile force of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sergeyev had planned to travel to the NATO
headquarters in Brussels later this month to further change ideas
as how to materialize the military-to-military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Russian defense minister told a joint press briefing with
Solana that his meeting with Solana and NATO defense ministers,
though not official, was very important in that it allowed him to
express Russia's general approach to the construction of
military-to-military cooperation within the established framework,
defined by the NATO-Russia Founding Act signed in May in Paris
during the NATO and Russia summit.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev also expressed at the informal meeting of NATO defense
ministers his country's readiness to exercise specific activities
on a permanent basis in the peacemaking mission in Bosnia and in
the construction of a new security framework in Europe as well as
Russian participation in it.
</P>
<P>
Russia, that blamed NATO for not consulting it before capturing
several pro-Radovan Karadzic radio and television transmitters in
Bosnia earlier this month, took part earlier today in another
NATO-led SFOR maneuver in which four pro-Pale transmitters were
captured and were planned to be handed to the Serbs in support of
the Republika Srpska president in Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR action, executed by some 400 troops with the Russians
blocking roads to prevent local unrest, took place without
incident, according to NATO sources.
</P>
<P>
Initial NATO-Russia military-to-military cooperation may have
to start with the arrival of a Russian permanent representative at
the NATO headquarters where each NATO member state is represented
permanently.
</P>
<P>
The Russian defense minister announced today that his country's
representative will arrive in NATO between October and November.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he trusted the 16-nation alliance as a new
security partner, Sergeyev said that he trusted the implementation
of the agreements reached between the two parties.

FREETOWN, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A Sierra Leonean official said
today his government would allow "all newspapers registered
before May 25 military coup to continue operations until the end
of the year when they would re-register again."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Commissioner for Information and
Broadcasting in the military government Sedu Turay said the
"concession will not be extended to newspapers which were not
registered by March 1996."
</P>
<P>
"These papers must cease publication immediately or face the
full penalty of the law," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Information had initially given all newspapers
in Sierra Leone six days which expired Tuesday to either register
or re-register or stop publication.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the 1980 Newspapers Act, which journalists have
consistently urged the authorities to repeal, Turay said,
"registration and re-registration of newspapers are not intended
to stifle the press."
</P>
<P>
"The Act protects the public from liberal and seditious
newspaper reporting. Some guidelines must be put in place to
ensure responsible journalism," he added.
</P>
<P>
Six out of the current 13 were put on sale Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Urges Israel to take Further Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian king Hussein today
said he was happy to see that Israel released Hamas leader Ahmad
Yassin, but more steps should be followed to reactivate the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king made the call after he welcomed Yassin at
the airport of Amman and sent him to King Hussein Medical Center
for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Israel released the founder of the Hamas (The Islamic
Resistance Movement) earlier today after Hussein made the appeal
Tuesday during a speech in Zarqa City, southwest to Amman.
</P>
<P>
Hussein hoped that the release of Yassin would be the first
step of a series of Israeli actions that might help reactivate
the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The king went to the medical center and visited Yassin who has
been in the Israeli prison sine 1989 and had been expected to
serve a life sentence for ordering armed attacks by Hamas
guerrillas against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
In the same hospital, Hussein also visited Khalid Mashiel,
head of the political bureau of Hamas who has been hospitalized
after attacked on September 25 by two Canadian tourists in Amman.
</P>
<P>
The two Canadians attempted to kill Mashiel in the morning in
front of his office but failed as Mashiel's security guards fought
back.
</P>
<P>
Hamas accused Israeli security department, Mossad, as being
behind the attack.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was established in 1987 to fight against Israel's
occupation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
In a statement today, Hamas welcomed the release of its founder
and expressed thanks to Jordanian King Hussein for his role in
freeing the seriously ailing anti-Israeli hardliner.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 1 (xinhua) -- A team of researchers at
the Konso site in Ethiopia have discovered two coexisting hominid
species known as homo erectus and Australopithecus Boisei between
1993 and 1997, the Ethiopian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Konso-Gardula research area, about 500 kilometers south of
Addis Ababa, is one of the paleoanthropological sites discovered
by a survey team led by Ethiopian professionals in the late 1980s
and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The Konso paleoanthropological site is the third site in the
world following Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, and Lake Turkana, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The report said, the Australopithecus Boisei found in 1993 at
Konso site was not known north of the Omo River, adding that homo
erectus has been found in different parts of Ethiopia including
the Middle Awash, Melka Konture and the Omo Basin.
</P>
<P>
All discovered at Konso are diverse stone tools which derive
from a multitude of time horizons spanning the 1.9 to 1.4 million
years.

The world's oldest well-dated assemblages are included in
these finds, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Teachers' Strike Tightens Kenyan Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Kenyan teachers
started a nationwide pay strike today, ignoring the government's
repeated warning and thus simmering the political atmosphere
ahead of general elections set for later this year.
</P>
<P>
In many schools in Nairobi, Kerugoya, Nakuru, Yatta and other
areas, teachers reportedly downed their tools by either failing
to turn up in schools, or staging a sit-in in classrooms, or
taking to the street for protests, said local sources today.
</P>
<P>
In a majority of secondary schools around the country,
teaching is going on as usual. But "in primary schools most
teachers were not able to continue with their normal duties,"
according to a governmental statement issued today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement warned that "the teachers who...
participate in the illegal strike will be committing an unlawful
act and shall be guilty of an offence."
</P>
<P>
The 24,000-member Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT),
which sponsored the stoppage, vowed last night that the strike
will go on until the government meets the teachers' 200-percent
pay hike demand.
</P>
<P>
The strike is widely believed to hurt the ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) in the coming elections as teachers, among
the lowest paid professionals in Kenya, carry considerable
political influences especially in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
It is the latest in a series of illegal rallies, protests,
demonstrations and turmoil having emerged since May in the
eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The government argued that the KNUT demand is unacceptable
because it means some 56 percent of governmental expenditure, or
nearly 90 billion Shillings (1.47 billion U.S. Dollars), has to
be used on salaries for teachers alone.
</P>
<P>
The government said that it is not in a position to adequately
remunerate public employees, including teachers, due to economic
pressures and financial constraints following the International
Monetary Fund cut a key loan to Kenya on July 31.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada raised
interest rate today by 25 basis points in a bid to slow down the
rapid-growing economy.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's bank rate and its operating band for the
overnight rate was raised by 0.25 percentage point to 3.75 percent
and to 3.25 -3.75 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this year that the Bank of Canada
increased its interest rates. Its last rate hike came on June 26.
</P>
<P>
"In recent months there has been growing evidence that the
Canadian economy is expanding rapidly and absorbing unused
capacity," the bank said today in a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
"Indicators of aggregate demand, output, and money supply
growth have all been strong."
</P>
<P>
"Given the lags between monetary policy actions and their
effect on the economy, timely action to moderate the extent of
monetary stimulus will contribute to making the economic expansion
long lasting," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's move was followed quickly by Canada's major
commercial banks.

The Royal Bank of Canada was first off the mark with an
increase in the prime lending rate to 5.25 percent from 4.75
percent.
</P>
<P>
Its new rate was matched by all the other major banks.

Statistics Canada reported on Tuesday that the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.8 percent in July, doubling the
pace of growth forecasters had been expecting.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the economy has expanded at an annual rate
above three percent, almost twice the growth rate of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The strong GDP growth in July has prompted economists to revise
their growth forecasts for the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Bank of Montreal,
predicted a growth rate of 4.4-5 percent for the third quarter, up
from a previous forecast of 3.75-4.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Urged to Respect and Care for Older </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of older people
from Addis Ababa gathered today at the National Lottery here in
celebration of International Day of Older Persons, calling for
giving due respect and providing care to older persons in
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth time that Ethiopians celebrated
International Day of Older Persons. There are more than 2.5
million people in Ethiopia who are 60 and above, 4.5 percent of
the population of 56 million in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Mengesha Hailemelekot, an official
from the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, said it is the
responsibility of the government and the population at large to
support and take care of older persons who in their youth and
adulthood had contributed much for the benefit of their country
and its people.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "with population explosion, the development
of cities, the introduction of modern civilization and the widely
rampant social problems, our tradition of helping one another has
been deteriorating from time to time leaving several of our
elderly compatriots with no one to care for them."
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the attendants at the meeting, demanded
for the establishment of a facility where the older persons could
keep themselves busy and be self-supportive and an association as
well as a national federation for the older persons.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Jets Bomb PKK Camps in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish warplanes today bombed
camps of the Kurdish rebels in a continuous military operation in
northern Iraq, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
were hit by the jets as they fled the area.
</P>
<P>
The report failed to give the number of the military planes
involved in today's air raid.
</P>
<P>
Turkish ground forces, backed by air and artillery fire,
captured a main PKK camp in Zap on Tuesday, and attacked
three other camps in the region.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the fighting is continuing in the regions of Kani,
Mazi, Ekmal Bervari, Meti, Carcel in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish fighter-bombers carried out an air strike on 15 PKK
camps last Thursday in northern Iraq where more than 1,000 PKK
militants were reportedly gathering for infiltration into
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Around 15,000 Turkish troops, backed by 130 tanks, crossed
into northern Iraq early last week to strike the PKK rebels there
and some 130 PKK militants have been killed so far, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military said that the gathering of the PKK rebels
in northern Iraq posed a serious threat to Turkey's border
security, saying that such operations would continue as long as
the threat existed.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Foreign Ministry said earlier that the
ongoing military operation in northern Iraq is only "a routine
and limited action."
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops have frequently launched cross-border actions in
northern Iraq over the past two years, causing severe criticism
from neighboring countries and some international bodies.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old war against the
Turkish government for the establishment of an independent Kurdish
state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
More than 27,000 people, including soldiers, civilians and
rebels, were killed in the armed clashes between the Turkish
government troops and PKK rebels.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Calls for Breaking U.S. Blockage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Cuba is calling for world
support in its continuous efforts in breaking up the blockage
imposed by the United States for the past three decades and more.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 52nd session of the U.N. General Assembly today,
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said the U.S. embargoes had
cost his country more than 60 billion U.S. dollars so far. He
called on the member states of the U.N. to stand up to fight
against "the imperial power who wants to subdue the world."
</P>
<P>
The economy of the country was distorted by the war conditions,
he said, and unmeasurable human, physical and psychological damage
sustain each new Cuban denunciation.
</P>
<P>
On top of all that, Cubans were deprived of free access to
medications that appeared in the market after 1979, including
third generation antibiotics and others to treat AIDS and cancer,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The blockade has been cruelly and arrogantly reinforced in the
eyes of the world, according to the Cuban foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. legislation also enacted some acts as a new escalation
of that blockade, he said. Such measures already harass over 35
countries of the world, that is, 2.3 billion people accounting for
42 percent of the world population and a potential market of 790
billion U.S. dollars, apart from global damage, Robaina quoted
some figures.

LUSAKA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official here

</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by Peter Machungwa, minister of labor

48th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China.

On behalf of Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, Machungwa
expressed Zambia's "profound" appreciation and gratitude for the

of economic development.
</P>
<P>
"This assistance has tremendously supplemented our
government's efforts in the struggle to uplift the living
standards of our people," said the minister.

LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe all
surged strongly and ended sharply higher today, with London rising
to another new record closing high.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market had hit a new all-time
trading high of 5,320.1 points earlier in the session as shares in
British Telecommunications jumped in the wake of a rival bid for
MCI of the US by another US group WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
Gilt strength and a rally on Wall Street also fueled the FTSE
100 index to move to its third record close of the past four
sessions at 5,317.1, up 72.9 points or 1.39 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, shares also ended on a solid footing, boosted by
a stronger dollar and firmer banking stocks. The DAX-30 index
failed to breach the key 4,200-level but closed 29.13 points
higher at 4,196.98.
</P>

French shares reversed early losses and closed the day with big

<HEADLINE> US Frustrated Over French-Iranian Gas Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has criticized France over a 2 billion dollar natural gas
deal with Iran, while admitting Washington has no leverage in
preventing Paris from doing so.
</P>
<P>
She complained in a Tuesday's speech to the Council on Foreign
Relations, a private group in New York, that U.S. friends and
allies had not heard Washington's warning that Iran is "supporting
terrorism and undermining the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
But she said the United States lacked leverage in trying to
stop France investing in Iran as it has no aid program for France,
for example, that could be turned on or off depending on whether
Paris backed the U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
"It is, indeed, frustrating," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration on September 29 threatened to impose
sanctions on the Total Co., the French oil giant, and other
companies of Russia and Malaysia for their contracts with Iran
over the 2 billion dollar gas deal.
</P>
<P>
But France returned with scoff, saying the United States has no
right to impose its law beyond its border.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody accepts that the United States can pass a law on a
global scale," French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Monday.
"American laws apply in the United States. They do not apply in
France."
</P>
<P>
It was said Undersecretary of State Suart Eizenstat is to go to
Paris to convey the U.S. opposition to the contract. Meanwhile,
the United States is negotiating with the European Union to try to
resolve trans-Atlantic differences over trade with Iran.

<HEADLINE> UK Deputy PM Outlines New Vision for Railways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRIGHTON, England, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Prime Minister
John Prescott today announced measures to boost investment in
Britain's railways, put the passenger first and ensure private
operators provide high quality services.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Labor Party's Conference, Prescott pledged
that central to his vision would be a new priority for the Rail
Franchising Director.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the longer term, the government will need to
legislate to put its objectives into practice. But today's
announcement marks a crucial first step towards a revitalized
industry, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government will set new objectives for the Franchising
Director to signal a real shift in railways policy -- putting
passengers first, according to Prescott.
</P>
<P>
He said that private sector operators will face tough
regulation to ensure they honor their commitment and justify the
massive amounts of public money being pumped into the rail
industry.
</P>
<P>
The government will also be looking to develop a constructive
partnership with them, encouraging investment and cooperation and
making sure companies like Railtrack pull their weight, Prescott
added.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that the Franchising Director's objectives
will:
</P>
<P>
-- Put further franchising on hold;
</P>
<P>
-- Establish a new "Rail investment" role for the Franchising
Director;
</P>
<P>
-- Make the Franchising Director more accountable; and
</P>
<P>
-- Safeguard passenger benefits.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, Prescott said, "The announcement is simply an
interim first step. If we want to achieve all our objectives for
rail, we will need radical reform."

<HEADLINE> ANC Welcomes Truth Commission Subpoenas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The African National
Congress (ANC), today welcomed the subpoenas served on former
president P. W. Botha and some of his cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
The subpoenas will compel them to appear before the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission on the role of the State Security
Council next month.
</P>
<P>
"The subpoenas served on members of the former State Security
Council is a welcome development towards the achievement of the
objective of national reconciliation and unity," a statement of
the ANC said.
</P>
<P>
Others subpoenaed include former defense minister Magnus
Malan, former law and order minister Darian Vlok and the
council's former secretary Pierre van der Westhuizen.
</P>
<P>
Former foreign minister Pik Botha and cabinet colleagues Roelf
Meyer and Leon Wessels accepted invitations to the council
hearing and were subsequently subpoenaed as a formality.
</P>
<P>
"The process of reconciliation requires answers about the
activities not only of the SSC (State Security Council), but also
all key structures falling immediately under it in the national
security management system and the national coordinating
mechanism," said the statement by ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa.
</P>
<P>
"The State Security Council controlled a totalitarian national
network which reached into every part of the country, identifying
anti-apartheid activists, formulating a continuous national
security profile and making decisions on action at national and
local levels."
</P>
<P>
These decisions were then implemented by formal law
enforcement structures backed by legislation, or by other
structures acting covertly, Mamoepa said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the members served with subpoenas should provide
answers on how security and third force networks functioned, how
extensive they were, what has happened to the networks and what
capacity these networks have to destabilize our new democracy."
</P>
<P>
The ANC maintains that the activities of the networks both
at home and abroad, including cross border raids and various
forms of violence, could not have taken place without the
knowledge of key officials at the highest levels of the
intelligence and security services as well as the State
Security Council, the statement said.

KUWAIT CITY, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain sold more than 310
million U.S. dollars of military equipment to Kuwait in 1996,
accounting for one third of its total exports to the country in
the year, Kuwait News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This figure was announced today by Mike Hurley, a first
secretary of the British embassy here at a press conference on the
occasion of a visit to Kuwait by a delegation of the British
Cambridge Chamber of Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Hurley said Britain exported to Kuwait 580 million pounds
sterling (more than 940 million dollars) worth of goods last year,
or 77 percent of the trade volume between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said military equipment, amounting to one third of British
exports to Kuwait, was followed by oil machinery, car, household
appliances, foodstuff, clothes and textile among other goods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, head of the British chamber delegation Barry Dare
said that during his visit here he would discuss ways with local
businessmen, representatives of the private sectors and the
Kuwaiti Chamber of Trade and Industry to enhance trade relations
between the both sides.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is the third largest market for British goods in the
Gulf region and the fourth in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Britain is one of the Western allies that has signed military
cooperation agreements with Kuwait following the Gulf War in 1991
that liberated Kuwait from Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, Kuwait could buy from Britain the
military equipment it needs to help rebuild the armed forces
destroyed by Iraqi troops during the Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial figures show that Britain has sold to Kuwait more
than 2 billion dollars worth of weapons since the end of the Gulf
War.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko today cancelled his visits to the Russian cities of
Lipetsk and Yaroslavl, scheduled for October 2-3, after Russia
refused his travel plan, the Interfax news service reported.
</P>
<P>
Head of Lukashenko's office, Mikhail Myashikovich, said that
Lukashenko had planned to fly to Lipetsk to open an exhibition of
Belarussian commodities.
</P>
<P>
He said the visit was cancelled because the Russian side did
not let Lukashenko's plane land at the airport of Lipetsk.

<HEADLINE> Enlargement Costs Manageable: NATO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAASTRICHT, Netherlands, October 2 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana today reaffirmed that enlargement costs will
be perfectly manageable and should not be magnified.
</P>
<P>
Solana made the remark after NATO defense ministers met their
counterparts from Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, the
three invitees for joining the 16-nation military alliance in
April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Czech Defense Minister Miloslav Vyborny, Polish Defense
Minister Stanislaw Dobrzanski and Hungarian Defense Minister
Gyorgy Keleti briefed the informal meeting of NATO defense
ministers on their preparations for accession.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief expressed his satisfaction with the fact that
all three invitees had turned in on time the NATO defense
planning questionnaires concerning their respective military
hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
The questionnaires will be part of the NATO cost evaluation and
calculation to be completed by late November this year.
</P>
<P>
Judging by the briefings, according to NATO sources, Hungary
looked to be better prepared, whereas Poland was less ready.
</P>
<P>
Today's joint meeting, the first between NATO defense ministers
and their counterparts from the three invited countries, was hailed as a
dress rehearsal of the accession to be held one and a half year
from now.
</P>
<P>
However, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic were warned
that getting the invitation at the NATO Madrid summit last July
does not mean that they were guaranteed to automatically become
full members after the elapsed time of 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Starting from next January, the parliaments of the 16 NATO
member states will start ratifying the accession process and the
Americans are likely to be the most difficult to persuade to
approve the enlargement, which was initiated primarily by the
urging of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic exposed 11 deficiencies in its defense
planning questionnaire, and accession to NATO enjoyed only
50-percent support in a recent poll in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs promised to catch-up by increasing defense
expenditures to account for 0.3 percent of its gross domestic
product by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarians wanted to involve its neighboring countries in
the joint security mechanism. But they must first of all conduct
the scheduled referendum concerning the accession.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian parliamentarians, on an earlier move, postponed the
referendum, which had been slated for November 19.
</P>
<P>
The Polish defense minister said the recent elections affirmed
the maturity and stability of his country, and the new government
will support the integration into the Euro-Atlantic partnership.
</P>
<P>
But the Poles raised concerns on procurement of modern weapons.
</P>
<P>
NATO defense ministers pointed out that it is wrong to think
that enlargement is all about buying new weapons. It is much more,
one NATO source said.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers saw the willingness of the three invitees
to commit reasonable financial resources to the process of
accession as agreeable; they felt reassured that a larger NATO has
to be stronger.
</P>
<P>
Solana told a press conference after the meeting that
enlargement is the right direction for development and
described the meeting with the three invitees as fruitful and
important.
</P>
<P>
He said that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic know what
they have to do to qualify for NATO membership.

</P>
<P>
He said the visit was cancelled because the Russian side did

</P>
<P>
Leonid Scherbakov, head of the traffic-control department of
the Russian Federal Air Service, was quoted as saying that flight
plans for Lukashenko to Lipetsk and Yaroslavl had never been
registered in its daily planning logs.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed surprise at
Lukashenko's visit to the two Russian cities without notifying
him, the report said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It doesn't happen here that the president of another
state comes to Russia without the knowledge of the Russian
president. Let him release (Pavel) Sheremet first," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sheremet is the head of the Minsk bureau of Russian Public
Television (ORT), who is now in custody in Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian Embassy in Minsk would neither confirm
nor deny reports that the Russian side had annulled the diplomatic
document permitting Lukashenko's plane to land in Lipetsk and
Yaroslavl.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko expressed regrets over the incident, saying he hoped
friendly relations between Belarus and Russia would develop
despite "the political games played by some kremlin circles."

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns of Acute Health Situation in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) warned here today that health conditions in the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is an increasingly serious
problem.
</P>
<P>
A WHO team that visited the DPRK on September 15-20 found that
many basic public health programs have been suspended or
drastically curtailed due to natural disasters and economic
problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The result is a decrease in immunization activities and an
increase in child malnutrition," WHO said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The team also found that the country's surveillance, prevention
and control systems do not function well enough to protect the
people from the threat of diseases such as tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
Because of a lack of tuberculosis control programs and
tuberculosis drugs, WHO estimated that the mortality of
tuberculosis cases could reach 50 percent in the DPRK, which
reports 10,000 tuberculosis cases per year.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of natural disasters that have hit the
country, power supplies have been severely curtailed, thus
immunization programs that depend on a reliable cold chain for the
delivery of effective vaccines have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, available replacement vaccines cannot be distributed
due to a lack of fuel for transport.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition among infants and children, including anaemia and
Vitamin A deficiency, is also a serious problem, said WHO.
</P>
<P>
Since there is an acute shortage of most ordinary drugs in the
DPRK hospitals and clinics, WHO, in cooperation with the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Medecins san Frontieres and the
Red Cross, is planning to provide them with drugs and medical
supplies.

<HEADLINE> 35 Killed by Land Mines in South Korea since 1992 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-five people have been killed
and 43 others wounded by land mines in South Korea since 1992, the
Defense Ministry said in a report to the National Assembly Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Based on the report submitted by the ministry, lawmaker Chung
Dong-young of the main opposition party claimed children were among
the 29 civilian victims, mostly in northern Kangwon Province near the
Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
Chung claimed there is an intricate web of land mines near the
DMZ, some dispersed through about 160 acres, and whose precise
location remains unknown even to military authorities.
</P>
<P>
Mountainous Yanggu County in Kangwon Province is also a mined
area, and 55 people have suffered injuries or died after stepping
on explosive devices there, Chung added.
</P>
<P>
"There are more than 1 million land mines along the DMZ, most
of which remain armed and deadly," the lawmaker said. "We have to
raise public awareness by disclosing their location."
</P>
<P>
Mines were also unearthed and carried south of the civilian
control line by last year's floods and have yet to be recovered,
Chung said.
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker asked military authorities to take measures to
remove the mines in areas frequented by civilians.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Falllout From Atomic Bomb Tests Raises Cancer Alarm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Some experts testified at a
Senate subcommittee hearing Wednesday that the public was not
informed in time of the cancer risks from radioactive fallout from
U.S. nuclear bomb tests 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Wednesday released
information from a study on radiation from atomic bomb tests
in the 1950s that predict an increase in thyroid cancer of 2
percent to 20 percent above normal.
</P>
<P>
The Senators and experts criticized the agency for failing to
offer useful information to millions of Americans who had been
exposed as children to fallout from 90 atmospheric bomb blasts at
the Nevada Test Site near Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
The NCI estimated that the 90 bomb tests put enough iodine-131
in the air to create health problems as far away as the East
Coast, and 10,000 to 75,000 Americans may develop thyroid cancer
in their lifetime because of the exposure.
</P>
<P>
At particular risk are those who were children living in "hot
spots" and who drank a great deal of milk during the test period,
because I-131 builds up in grazing cattle and is transmitted
readily through milk.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported today that thyroid cancer has been
increasing at about 0.9 percent per year in recent decades.

<HEADLINE> No Major Inflation in China This Year: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Economic experts have ruled out
the possibility of any major inflation in China for the rest of
the year, according to a report in today's Shanghai Securities
News.
</P>
<P>
The experts noted that at present, the general supply and
demand in the Chinese market will have a stabilizing effect on
prices, with all major commodities' supply exceeding the market
demand.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country's agricultural sector has scored bumper
grain harvests for three years in a row, and urban residents'
buying mentality remains calm.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they said, even if there is a slight rebound in
commodity prices in the final months of 1997, the annual increase
of the consumer goods retail price index could be controled to around
two percent, and the residents' consumption price index would rise
by no more than 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Transportation Facilities for Three Gorges Project Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The 302-meter-long and
21-meter-wide Tanjiatuo Bridge spanning a temporary shiplock at
the Three Gorges Dam has become operational.
</P>
<P>
Its opening to traffic concluded the construction of a group of
transportation facilities, including a 28-kilometer-long highway
for special use that connects the Yichang-Huangshi expressway, two
main bridges, namely the Tanjiatuo Bridge and Yangtze Bridge at
Xiling and one leading port, which link the dam area with Yichang
City, the headquarter of the Three Gorges project.
</P>
<P>
The highway, which was opened to traffic one year ago, involved
34 bridges and five culverts alone. It cuts the traffic time from
the dam area to the city of Yichang from an hour and a half to 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Yangjiawan Port with six 1,000-ton berths, which was also
built last year, will serve as a transfer station for materials
for construction of the project.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimated that a total of 40 million tons of
construction materials need to be transported via highways and
waterways before the whole dam project is scheduled to be finished
in 2009.

<HEADLINE> Locking of Yangtze Important to Three Gorges Dam Construction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Locking of the main stream of
the Yangtze River is vital to the successful construction of the
gigantic water control project at the Three Gorges.
</P>
<P>
The locking is scheduled to take place from November 6-8,
signaling the end of the first-phase construction of the dam and
the beginning of the second.
</P>
<P>
The entire water control project will be constructed in three
phases over a 17-year period.
</P>
<P>
During the first stage from 1993 to 1997, preparatory work,
mainly resettlement of residents in the area to be submerged,
should be completed.
</P>
<P>
The second stage will start when the Yangtze is cut off by two
parallel earth-and-stone cofferdams this November, and extend
through the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
During the third stage from 2004 to 2009, the 630,000-sq-m
riverbed between the two cofferdams will be drained to make way
for dam construction and the generator stations to be installed on
the northern bank of the river.
</P>
<P>
Work on the auxiliary facilities began in 1993, and they have
been basically completed. Building of a temporary ship lock and
lift has been finished on schedule, while construction of the
cofferdams from both banks of the river has proceeded swiftly.
</P>
<P>
Locking of the Yangtze is a vital prerequisite for bringing the
Three Gorges Dam into a profitable period. The Three Gorges Dam
involves a static investment of 90.05 billion yuan (10.85 billion
US dollars) and raise needed funding has been difficult, therefore
income from power generation will be one of major sources of
financing.

Twenty-six generators will be installed at the Three Gorges
Project; the first two will start power generation in the year
2003. And by the year 2009, the water control dam will have
generated 293 billion kw/hours of electricity and will have
directly accumulated some 80 billion yuan (9.6 billion US dollars)
in funding for continuous construction of the dam.
</P>
<P>
Power generation at the Three Gorges Dam is guaranteed as the
Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation has
signed contracts with two European-led conglomerates to provide 14
generators, each with a generating capacity of 700,000
kw. Contractors for building of other necessary facilities have
also been hired.
</P>

Moreover, locking of the Yangtze will also serve as the testing
ground for all technology used in the dam construction.

</P>
<P>
According to the report, the agency has characterized the
killing of its employees as an unjustifiable and unacceptable act
against the humanitarian activities they were undergoing in
Kismayu.
</P>
<P>
The deceased local aid workers belonging to the Marehan
sub-clan were murdered by Majerten militiamen during the height
of clan animosity between the two sub-clans over the control of
Kismayu.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities in Kismayu have failed to punish those
responsible for killing the two aid workers who were serving at
the out-door patient clinic run by World Concern in the town.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the VHF radio in the town indicate that World
Concern will also shut down its mother and child health care post
inside Kismayu. The agency was also treating hundreds of people
suffering from various mental disorders.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the office of the U. N. aid agency of UNICEF was
closed down early in the week for security related matters.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the closure of UNICEF's office in Kismayu took
place after a UNICEF chartered plane trying to land at the
airport of the town was fired upon by Somali gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft allegedly transporting medicine and other health
utensils had to return to Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The airport of Kismayu has been a troubled point where rival
militiamen exchange fire at the arrival of aircraft. Two people
were killed at the airport a few days ago when fighting erupted
on dispute over the narcotic leaves of khat transported to the
airport by a Cesna plane.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the two aid agencies offices in Kismayu is a
major setback to the already poor humanitarian situation in the
town especially when it is in bad need of more humanitarian
supplies of food and medicine.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, October 2 (Xinhua)-- Lassa Fever has claimed 47
lives between March and September in the east of Sierra Leone, a
Clinical report said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 300 patients were admitted to
hospitals between March and September and 47 of them died. The
highest number of admissions for one month was in March when 147
patients were brought into the Clinic in Panguma in the east and
22 of them later died.
</P>
<P>
Other deaths have gone unrecorded for lack of transportation,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Senior Nurse in Chrgem Balu
Sankoh, the towns of Tongo, Panguma and Kenema, all diamond
mining areas were the hardest hit by the disease.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the patients suffered from diarrhoea while
the rest had symptoms of vomiting, fever, sore-throat, low blood
pressure and chest pains.
</P>
<P>
The Medical Officer in charge of the Clinic, Amiru Cohteh told
Xinhua that the epidemic escalated last year.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the cause to poor sanitation, rats overcrowding
and poor diet.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Areas, SEZs of China Seek Higher Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Governments and people in
China's coastal areas and Special Economic Zones (SEZ) are seeking
ways to make their economies grow more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao, a coastal city in east China's Shandong Peninsula, has
worked out plans to promote foreign trade, improve the local
service sector and attract more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Yantai, another coastal city in the peninsula, has so far
restructured 1,133 local enterprises. It is now considering
deepening the ownership reform and speeding up the introduction of
the shareholding and joint stock-partnership systems.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou, a picturesque city known as the "paradise on earth" in
east China's Jiangsu Province, plans to revitalize the state-owned
economy by optimizing the use of state capital and reshuffling
local state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou City Government claimed that it would make every
effort to preserve and increase the value of state assets,
introduce competitiveness into enterprise operation and
employment, and set up a social security system that covers every
local citizen.
</P>
<P>
Ningbo, a port city in east China's Zhejiang Province, boasts
one of the country's four first-class deep-water harbors -- the
Beilun Harbor.
</P>
<P>
Last year the cargo handling capacity of the Ningbo port
reached over 76 million tons, ranking third in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We will seize the current golden opportunity to build the
Beilun Harbor into China's second largest international harbor
after Shanghai. By the year 2000, Beilun will have an annual cargo
handling capacity of over 100 million tons," said Ye Xinhu,
director of the Ningbo Port Administration.
</P>
<P>
The Pudong New Development Area in China's largest city
Shanghai has become one of the country's most rapidly developed
areas over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
"Pudong will make full use of the macro market structure it has
developed in past years to serve the reshuffle of assets and
multi-national operation of enterprises, especially large
state-owned enterprises and groups," said an official in charge of
the area's economic affairs.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Promoting Economic Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa attaches
great importance to existing economic and trade relations between
China and South Africa, and expressed hope to further promote the
relations, a South African official said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the China Trade Expo '97,
Premier Tokyo Sexwale of the Gauteng Provincial government said
that China, as a rising economic giant of the world, would be
very helpful to South Africa's economic development.
</P>
<P>
"The sheer size of China provides our own business people with
enormous business opportunities not only as a huge market and an
investment destination, but more crucially as providing the
crucial foothold to enter the bustling southeast Asian economic
hinterland.
</P>
<P>
"We thus see this China Expo '97 as part of a broader strategy
to consolidate China-South Africa relations, as an opportunity
for increased trade between our two countries, as providing our
prospective business people and government officials with the
opportunity to get to know one another," Sexwale said.
</P>
<P>
China and South Africa, which are expecting to establish full
diplomatic relations before the end of the year, have been making
efforts to promote bilateral trade in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Sexwale said that China had invested over 40 million U.S.
Dollars in a chrome mine operation in the Northern Province. The
volume of trade between South Africa and China now stands at well
over 2.7 billion U.S. Dollars and is growing day by day, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier pointed out that the full diplomatic relations
between the two countries would create the requisite legal
framework for "reciprocal intergovernmental exchanges". A
cooperation agreement between the two countries would soon be
concluded, he said.
</P>
<P>
Isaac Mogase, the mayor of Greater Johannesburg, also
participated in the opening ceremony of the China Trade Expo '97,
the fifth of its kind in South Africa since 1993.
</P>
<P>
He said the exposition was presenting "a good opportunity of
trade and exchanges for people in the business circles of the two
countries".
</P>
<P>
Mogase expressed belief that there is great potential and vast
prospects for economic and trade cooperation between South Africa
and China.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the exposition, about 80 Chinese companies
have presented more than 400 traditional and newly-developed
products ranging from machinery, electronics, electric
applicances to textiles and garments, arts and crafts.

<HEADLINE> Australia Cannot Be Complacent About Asian Students: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- - Australia could not afford to
be complacent about its ability to continue attracting large
numbers of Asian students to study here, Education Minister Amanda
Vanstone warned today.
</P>
<P>
Australia would need to start looking at alternative markets in
order to maintain the current 2.1 billion US dollar a year
industry, Australia's fifth largest service export earner, or
about 3 percent of the country's total exports, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot be complacent ... and we must continue to strive to
maintain the highest standard of education and training in the
Asia Pacific region," she said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the Australian International
Education Foundation's (AIEF) booklet to promote vocational
education overseas, the minister said Australia would start
looking at new overseas student markets.
</P>
<P>
Recent AIEF data has indicated a fall off in the number of new
overseas students for the first half of this year in the region.
</P>
<P>
The foundation warned that numbers could drop further next year
when the race debate sparked by independent MP Pauline Hanson
could impact on enrollments.
</P>
<P>
She said the continued flow of overseas students here would
help promote Australia as a friendly and tolerant nation.
</P>
<P>
Vanstone's comments follow the release earlier this week of a
study showing Malaysian students saw Australia as a racist and
unsafe country because of press reports about Pauline Hanson.
</P>
<P>
Hanson, who advocates a cut in intake of Asian immigration and
an end to foreign investment in Australia, has been widely seen as
a racist.
</P>
<P>
The minister has previously warned that Hanson was costing
Australia jobs every time she opened her mouth, while "damaging
our reputation among Asian students."

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Council Member Explains Reason for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 2 (Xinhua)-- Palestinian Council (PC)
member Haider Abdul Shafi said today that improper cooperation
between PC and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) is the
main reason for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference today at the PC administrative
office in Ramallah, West Bank, Shafi said the PNA has never taken
into consideration the PC's recommendations on human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
Shafi, who submitted his resignation Wednesday, said his
resignation is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
The PC has attempted to respond to citizen's complaints and
tried to transcend its responsibility in defending citizen's
rights, but the PNA placed obstacles for the PC in this matter,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining other reasons for his resignation, Shafi said the
PNA has recently shut down 17 Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement)
institutions in Gaza Strip and the West Bank, which provide
humanitarian services to the citizens, but it didn't clarify the
reason for closing those institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said there were many complaints by citizens to the PC on the
security apparatus' violations, but the PNA did not discuss the
PC's recommendations on this matter.
</P>
<P>
Shafi's resignation will be discussed in the PC's next session
two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
Shafi, a physician from the Gaza city, established the
Democratic Building Movement prior to the PC election in 1996,
and ran under that name.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President Rejects FIS Appeal for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Algiers, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Liamine Zeroual
has rejected an appeal by the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS)
to hold talks with Islamic groups, despite a unilateral truce
announced by the military wing of FIS, the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the cabinet on Wednesday, Zeroual
described as "fantastic and unfounded rumors" reports that the
Algerian authorities had been holding secret talks with the FIS
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
In response to suggestions that clemency be given by the
government to the Islamists who have given up the armed struggle,
he said the case of FIS has definitely been closed.
</P>
<P>
Zeroual denied that differences exist among various state
institutions over whether a re-examination of the FIS case should
be made.
</P>
<P>
The FIS leaders in exile in Europe said the truce, announced by
AIS on September 24, became effective on Wednesday, but the
Algerian media today remained extremely prudent about its effect.
</P>
<P>
The truce announcement coincided with a brutal wave of
massacres of civilians around the capital Algiers over the past
few weeks, for which another radical Islamic group, the Armed
Islamic Group (GIA), has claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The AIS, which had been active in the west and the east of the
country but not around the capital, said that it decided to start
the truce after holding negotiations with unspecified Algerian
government organs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, an FIS bulletin, El Ribat, said on Wednesday that the
truce was concluded between the AIS and the National People's Army
of Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The FIS demanded that the truce should be followed up by a
general amnesty, the lifting of the state of emergency, which has
been in force since 1992, and the holding of a national
reconciliation conference to be attended by all state
institutions, the FIS and other Algerian groups without exclusion.
</P>
<P>
The FIS and AIS said the truce does not make up a surrender to
the government, but is instead the first step toward a negotiated,
political solution to the six-year-old Algerian conflict.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 people have been killed in Algeria since 1992,
when the country was plunged into violence after the army canceled
an election result that could have brought Islamists to power.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Outlines Carrot-And-Stick for Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian officials and
athletes who breached the code of conduct would have to repay
expenses incurred in the South Asian Games in Jakarta, Olympic
Council of Malaysia (OCM) President Hamzah Abu Samah said.
</P>
<P>
"We will propose that those caught for indiscipline pay back
all expenses incurred... the time has come for severe actions be
taken against those black sheep," Hamzah was reported as saying by
Bernama news agency Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Their associations would also be made answerable for their
indiscipline and may face punitive actions from the OCM, he said.
</P>
<P>
The OCM had to fork out about 1.5 million ringgit (500,000
U.S. dollars) to send its contingent of 530 athletes and 230
officials for the biennial SEA Games from October 11-19.
</P>
<P>
The OCM is an umbrella body which has to endorse athletes
participation in international multi-sports events, while the
government-based National Sports Council handles funding for
training and overseas stints.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah said beer company Carlsberg had pledged 1,000 ringgit
for each gold medal while the National Sports Council has promised
5,000 ringgit under its incentive program.
</P>
<P>
For athletics, an additional 1,000 ringgit is offered by the
Malaysian Amateur Athletics Association for a gold medal, a new
national record or a new SEA games record.
</P>
<P>
Officials are targetting 50 gold medals from the Games this
time mostly in martial arts and athletics, compared to 31 gold
medals in the 1995 SEA Games in Chiengmai, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
A total of 440 gold medals will be up for grabs in 34 events in
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah said the best Malaysian athlete of the day throughout
the Games would also be rewarded with 2,000 ringgit cash and a
medal, under an incentive scheme between OCM and John Hancock Life
Insurance since 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the winner's association will receive 1,000
ringgit for their role in "training and developing future stars,"
Hamzah added.

PARIS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- France today approved of the move
by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRCongo) to send observers to
the neighboring Congo Republic, while expressing regret over its
decision to re-call international investigators looking into the
massacres of Hutu refugees in the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"Sending observers will help put an end to the bombardment and
counter-bombardment (in Brazzaville); it will also serve to avoid
confrontations and violence, and hopefully help avoid the
escalation of tension," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman
Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo said
Wednesday it would send a group of observers to Brazzaville to
establish a "corridor" to keep Kinshasa safe and to investigate
the cases of firings across the Zaire (Congo) River into Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during a visit to Kinshasa by President
Pascal Lissouba, which was described by Lissouba's rival, General
Denis Sassou N'guesso, as "a direct involvement of Kinshasa in the
conflict" of the Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations Security Council in New York, France
proposed on September 26 sending an international peacekeeping
force to Brazzaville under the UN flag, which was strongly opposed
by the United States.

WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading American newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- France announced that it would not rejoin the NATO military
command structure later this year because the United States was
not ready to let a European officer take over the Southern Command
in Naples. The post has always been held by an American and
includes the United States Sixth Fleet.
</P>
<P>
-- The Democratic National Committee quietly transferred at
least 32 million U.S. dollars to state Democratic parties in the
last election as part of an elaborate plan to spend more money
than Federal election law appeared to allow on a massive
advertising campaign that indirectly helped re-elect President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- NATO-led peacekeeping troops seized control of four key
television broadcasting towers in the Serb-controlled half of
Bosnia Wednesday, hoping to achieve by force what international
officials have failed to secure by repeated pressure: media more
balanced and to their liking.
</P>
<P>
-- The National Cancer Institute and federal health officials
unduly delayed informing the public about cancer risks from
radioactive fallout 40 years ago, several experts testified at a
Senate subcommittee hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- WorldCom's 30 billion U.S. dollars bid for MCI would be the
largest takeover ever, giving the No. four long-distance carrier
unmatched assets in long-distance, local and international
services. Indeed, WorldCom could emerge with unprecedented
clout and, potentially, pricing power over the Internet. The offer
left British Telecom with few attractive choices and unleashed
speculation about which telecom companies will be acquired next.
</P>
<P>
-- "Fast-track" trade legislation passed the Senate Finance
panel in what the White House hopes will be a boost for the
troubled proposal. In a compromise to win bipartisan support,
references to labor and environmental rights would be largely
advisory, and programs to aid workers hurt by imports would
continue.

<HEADLINE> Telstra Launches Australia's 1rst Internet Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia's telecommunications
giant Telstra Corp today officially launched a new Internet
commerce product which it said would allow customers to buy
products and services with confidence on the web.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Moriarty, chief executive officer with Telstra
Multimedia, launched SureLink, a trading tool which Moriarty said
assured total security for credit card transactions.
</P>
<P>
Moriarty said it was the first electronic commerce product of
its kind in Australia.
</P>
<P>
However, the move has already been described as a
"disappointment" by other industry players trying to establish
secured electronic transactions (SET).
</P>
<P>
They say Telstra's move jumps the gun on SET, which is being
backed by the likes of Microsoft, Visa and Mastercard.
</P>
<P>
SET is being established as a non-profit merchant trading
system while Telstra's Surelink service charges a fee, with
Telstra hoping it will secure a burgeoning supply of
transaction-based fee revenue.
</P>
<P>
"SET is coming on at fairly rapid rate, I'm not sure why
Telstra is not more committed," said Greg Storey, head of VisaNet
Services, part of Visa International.
</P>
<P>
"It provides merchants small and large with the mechanism for
commercializing their websites," said Moriarty.
</P>
<P>
Merchants have to sign-up to the program and Telstra has no
plans to extend this to international merchants, meaning global
shopping on the web via SureLink is not on offer.

because each settlement requires military protection, political
observers here noted.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Now which has sent out 17 groups this summer to scour
the new Jewish settlements in the West Bank found that under the
Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
large-scale construction of Jewish settlements took place close to
the pre-1967 border along the Green Line between Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Aharon Domb, Secretary General of the Council of Jewish
Settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, puts the number of
homes now being built at 6,500, 2,000 of which are deep inside
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, hundreds of housing units are under
construction at Givat Ze'ev, a suburb north of
Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Jewish housing construction is under way at
Nahliel, north of Ramallah, a community of 60 Jewish families
surrounded by Palestinian villages.
</P>
<P>
In Eli and Shilo between Ramallah and Nablus, finished homes on
the mountain ridge road which are banned from sale under the
former Labor government are now on the market. Israel promised to
build more when they were sold.
</P>
<P>
In Afrat near Gosh Etzion, south of Bethlehem, 300 new housing
units will be built, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Besides huge investments on housing constructions, the
Netanyahu's government this year also allocated around 84.3
million U.S. dollars on construction of roads, lighting, sewerage,
factories and hotels within the settlement areas in the West bank,
according to the Peace Now.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the Netanyahu government has not only
reversed the policy of Labor government's cutting of financial
incentive to Jewish settlers, but also unlocked 3,000 housing
units in the West Bank that the Labor government had frozen.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Israel's settlement policy has become a big
obstacle to the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, harming
the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> More Residents Move Out of Three Gorges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- By mid-September, most of the
39,600 residents had been moved out of areas in central China's
Hubei Province, which will be submerged in early November when
locking begins on the Three Gorges Dam on the the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Resettlement and Development of the Three Gorges
Project Construction Committee of the State Council, made the
announcement in late September.
</P>
<P>
A reservoir with a storing capacity of 39.3 billion cu m and a
projected water height of 175 m will be built at the gigantic dam,
which will be completed in four phases over 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the water level of the Yangtze at the Three Gorges
area is recorded at 78 m. It will be driven to the first-stage
height of 82.24 m after the main stream of the Yangtze is cut off
from November 6-8.
</P>
<P>
The four-meter rise in water level will cause the inundation of
part of seven counties of central China's Hubei Province and and
southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, which required 39,600
local residents to move out of their homes before June 1996, when
flood season of the Yangtze begins.
</P>
<P>
By mid-September, residential quarters with a combined floor
space of some 700,000 sq m had been built to accommodate residents
from the soon-to-be submerged areas. Some 86 of the 116 factories
have also moved from the areas, with the remaining ones pledging
to leave before next May.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Dam will prevent flooding on the Yangtze and
will have an annual power output of 84.7 billion kwh. The entire
project will be completed in 17 years.

<HEADLINE> Garbage Collection Modernized in Guangzhou of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Guangzhou, south
China, are joining the local "garbage revolution" by taking their
trash out every night rather than leaving it in dustbins for
sanitation workers to collect.
</P>
<P>
The new form of trash pick-up has been underway since the
beginning of the year in the Liwan District of Guangzhou, capital of
south China's Guangdong Province, and is rapidly becoming popular
in the other seven urban districts in Guangzhou, according to
Guangzhou Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Dustbins have been used in Guangzhou for more than 20 years.
The city plans to eliminate its 30,000 dustbins, which
seriously pollute the city and are the cause of frequent
complaints from local residents.
</P>
<P>
Sanitation workers now will go door-to-door to collect bagged
garbage, then compress it before hauling it away.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the daily 5,000 tons of garbage produced in the
city, Guangzhou will build 120 garbage compression
centers within three years, each covering an area of more than 100
square meters, according to an official. It also has closed its
over 1,500 dustbin storage centers, he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, The city plans to build 53 garbage compression
centers this year, 16 of which have already been completed. And
garbage trucks using advanced technology for compression are to be
used, the official said.
</P>
<P>
More than half of Guangzhou's citizens will be participating in
the new trash collection program by the end of this year, the
official promised.

<HEADLINE> Countdown Starts for Damming Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The countdown has begun for the
damming of the Yangtze River from November 6-8, a project designed
to make way for the world's largest hydro-electric endeavor.
</P>
<P>
Sources said today that the damming would be the most difficult
job of its kind in the world. When the work begins, the scheduled
flow volume will stand at 14,000 to 19,400 cubic meters per
second, the most ever reported in the world in the course of
damming a river for building a hydro-electric station.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that high tides and surging water in the Three Gorges
as well as complicated geological conditions, might cause problems,
scientists said that essential steps must be taken to deal with
potential collapse or leaking of the cofferdams.
</P>
<P>
As there are usually drastic changes of flow and water levels
in winter, engineers and workers are braced for any complications,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Two parallel cofferdams on both banks of the river have been
operating smoothly since last November. The final damming of the
river will need to sink great amounts of earth and rocks into the
river to connect the two cofferdams. After the work is completed,
the Yangtze will be forced to change its course.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the mouth of the river has been narrowed from 800
meters to just 360 meters, and it is expected to be further
narrowed to 130 meters by the end of October, according to He
Gong, deputy general manager of the China Yangtze River Three
Gorges Project Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day damming process, some 210,000 cubic meters
of earth and rocks are required to be sunk into the river to block
the mouth, he said. The biggest rock weighs three to five tons.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Rise in Forest Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- China has to date fulfilled some
95 percent of its afforestation goal for this year, with an
estimated 4.2 million hectares of trees planted across the country
during the past nine months, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3.7 million hectares of trees, over 90 percent of the
total, were planted through ground afforestation, while the rest
of the work was done by aerial seeding, the English newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that at present, Tianjin, the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region and 14 other provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions have completed or exceeded their own objectives
for tree-planting.
</P>
<P>
"The achievements were due to increases in manpower and
investment, the leading role played by key projects, the
employment of improved technology and the introduction of the
market economy across the country," the newspaper quoted an
official with the Ministry of Forestry as saying.
</P>
<P>
It said that 10 key afforestation projects received top
priority this year. They include the Shelter Belt Project in
northeast, north and northwest China, the Huaihe River-Taihu Lake,
Pearl River, Yellow River middle reaches and Liaohe River projects.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of this year's task, the Ministry of Forestry
called for new projects to be carried out and great efforts to be
made to protect forestry resources.
</P>
<P>
"Effective preservation of existing forests is the most
economical and efficient way to improve the environment," Minister
of Forestry Chen Yaobang was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government recently vowed to control soil erosion
and develop ecologically sound agriculture, so as to turn the
country, especially the northwestern regions, into a more
prosperous and beautiful place in the early years of the next
century.
</P>
<P>
China Daily said that the forest coverage rate in China is
expected to rise to 15.5 percent by the year 2000, compared with
the present 13.92 percent.

<HEADLINE> Trust and Investment Company Taps Overseas Capital Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hainan International Trust
and Investment Company in southernmost China has made new headway
in tapping overseas capital market, with its successfully offering
of 14 billion Japanese yen in bonds in Japan.
</P>
<P>
All the funds pooled from the bond issue will be directed into
the major construction projects in the island province, according
to company officials.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1988 as a provincial government-funded
investment company, the Hainan International Trust and Investment
Company became one of the ten financial organs that were
authorized to raise capital from overseas in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The company has since actively tapped the overseas capital
market, establishing relationships with more than 100 banks
overseas.
</P>
<P>
It channeled its first overseas loans of 15 million US dollars
into Hainan in late 1992, and has since then raised funds through
issuing bonds in Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore. In 1996, the
company provided a total of 1.18 billion yuan (142 million US
dollars) for the construction of key projects in Hainan province.

<HEADLINE> Australian Opposition Accused for Travel Rorts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government today
claimed victory in the battle over travel rorts after Prime
Minister John Howard accused opposition leader Kim Beazley of
fudging the facts to protect his Senate deputy leader Nick Sherry.
</P>
<P>
Howard ended the fortnight of tit-for-tat allegations on the
front foot over Senate Sherry's 320 Australian dollars a night
claims for staying with his mother at Opossum Bay, 49 kilometers
from Hobart, Tasmania.
</P>
<P>
Howard ignored pressure for a truce after being forced last
week to sack three ministers and two key staffers over an apparent
cover-up of travel allowance repayments.
</P>
<P>
The travel allowance scandal was revealed last week when
Opposition leader Beazley in parliament called for resignation of
the Transport Minister John Sharp for wrongfully claiming 47
nights 8,740 Australian dollars (6,292 US dollars) travel
allowance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister for Administrative Services David Jull and
two of high-ranking officials in the prime minister office were
also forced to quit after being accused of covering up the
scandals.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Minister for Science and Technology Peter
McGauran was forced to resign after admitting to mistaken travel
claims of about 1,400 Australian dollars (1,008 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Howard has the chance today to fire back against Beazley of
weakness for failing to apply the same standards to Senator Sherry
and attacked what he said was a cut-and-paste job on bureaucratic
definitions to justify his claims.
</P>
<P>
Labor deputy leader Gareth Evans said both sides had suffered
under the public brawling, "the battlefield is littered with
bodies on one side, a couple of flesh wounds on the other."

<P>
TEHRAN, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader and
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Ali Khamenei today
appointed Brigadier General Abdul-Ali Pourshasb as the commander
of the Ground Forces of the Army.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said in his statement that he made the appointment
because of Pourshasb's competence, honesty and efficiency during
the period he served as the deputy commander of army's ground
forces.
</P>
<P>
It took five months for Pourshasb to become the commander of
the ground forces after he was appointed the acting commander
when Brigadier General Ahmad Dadbin was removed on May 6 from
the commander of ground forces without giving any reason.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement gave no any background about the new
commander of the ground forces.
</P>
<P>
General Ali Shahbazi, the chief of the Joint Staff Command of
the Armed Forces, said earlier that Pourshasb had a bright
background in different operational, training and administrative
fields especially during the eight-year war between Iran and
Iraq (1980-1988).
</P>
<P>
"Pourshasb who is a religious and an experienced officer
possesses a great capacity and a remarkable commitment in
undertaking his duties," Shahbazi said.

<HEADLINE> Internet Saves Chinese Boy's Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- A one-year-old Chinese boy
suffering from congenital heart disease got helps from the United
States after his father sent a message on the Internet calling for
help, according to a "China Daily" report today.
</P>
<P>
The boy returned to east China's Shanghai municipality last
week after receiving a successful operation provided by a hospital
at New Jersey, the U.S., the report said.
</P>
<P>
The baby was born with serious heart problems early this
year. But many local hospitals were unable to cure the disease for
technological reasons.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father then sent a message on the Internet calling
for help. He later received response from a US woman named Gloria,
who managed to find the hospital that agreed to conduct an
operation for the boy free of charge.
</P>
<P>
One of Gloria's sons once suffered from the same heart disease
and recuperated following an operation.

<HEADLINE> EU FMs Formally Sign Amsterdam Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Amsterdam, October 2 (Xinhua) -- A new treaty was formally signed
by the European Union (EU)'s foreign ministers or their
representatives here today to replace the EU's Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Amsterdam Treaty, which was signed at the Royal Palace of
Amsterdam, is scheduled to enter into force on January 1 of 1999 at the
earlist date after its ratification by national parliaments of the
15 EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was attended Thursday by Dutch Prime
Minister Wim Kok, President of the European Commission Jacques
Santer, President of the European Council Jean-Claude Juncker and
Jose-Maria Gil-Robles, president of the European Parliament, in the
presence of the Dutch Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the new treaty which is supposed to complement and
replace the old one, is regarded as a low-key affair by EU
observers.
</P>
<P>
The signed voluminous document contains a version of the
Amsterdam Treaty which has been translated into all the languages of
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Considered less ambitious than its predecessor, the new treaty
pays more attention to diverse national interests of the 15 EU
member states and the reform of EU institutions than to an
enlarged EU.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the new treaty could hardly be
regarded as a success since the negotiations on the revision of the
Maastricht Treaty were believed to be started at an inappropriate early
date when the EU had not yet recovered from the injury inflicted by
the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Mainland's Tariffs Cut Benefits Macao: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The cut of tariffs from Wednesday
on some 5,000 kinds of commodities by the Chinese interior customs
authorities will benefit Macao, local traders and economic experts
said.
</P>
<P>
The tariff cut may help increase shipments of some goods from
Hong Kong to the Chinese interior areas via Macao, although it has no
immediate effect, some local ocean-shipping dealers said.
</P>
<P>
They said that Hong Kong will benefit the most from the tariff
cut because it is the biggest entrepot between the Chinese
interior areas and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese interior customs authorities cut tariffs on
imported goods from an average 23 percent to 17 percent from
October 1. Those goods are mainly farm produce and high-tech
goods.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of tariffs is also beneficial to Macao in the
long run, said Liu Chak Wan, a top executive of the Macao
Association of Importers and Exporters.
</P>
<P>
"Although the current amount of goods Macao re-exports to the
Chinese interior is small, Macao can become a bonded warehouse for
some low-tariffed goods destined for the Chinese interior," he
told the Macao Daily News. "Part of the goods can be stored or
processed in Macao and re-exported to the Chinese interior later."
</P>
<P>
Macao businessmen may also benefit from the lowered tariffs
when they establish plants in the Chinese interior, said Chui Sai
Cheong, president of the Macao Association of Economics Study.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, many Macao manufacturers have shifted
their plants to the Pearl River Delta and other interior areas.
Such trend continues as a result of increasingly higher cost of
production in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Macao businessmen, who are doing business in the Chinese
interior, will be able to buy cheaper imported equipment and raw
materials to expand their production there, he said.

<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Devoted doctors of the Beijing
Emergency Medical Center usually have to work many hours in a row
and can hardly snatch some time for a rest, according to today's
"China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed this to the fact that the center is the
only one of its kind providing pre-hospital medical care in
Beijing. A 24-hour health emergency hotline is available for
patients in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
Every day the center generally has to deal with about 100
emergencies, sometimes about 300 cases per day, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
"It is really a full-time job. No weekends, nor holidays,"
Doctor Wang Haoran of the center was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Words couldn't describe how tired I was at that time," said
another doctor named Bi Dongxiang, when recalling a rescue work
that lasted till 11 o'clock in the evening.
</P>
<P>
But most of them have been used to this kind of life, saying
that all the hard work is worth it when a life is saved. "Doctors
enjoy great sense of fulfilment," said Bi.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1988, the center has saved many
lives.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has put
aside 25 billion Uganda Shillings (some 25 millions U.S. dollars)
for lending to exporters to promote their business, The New
Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
Abel Rwendeire, State Minister for Trade and Industry, told
parliamentary committee that exporters of flowers and mushroom
could borrow the money at low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Flowers and mushroom are non-traditional goods for export
which have increased rapidly in recent years in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
This is an initiative to promote export, the minister pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
A grant of 4.5 million U.S. dollars will also be available in
the next year to promote the export of cotton and coffee, which
are main foreign exchange earners.
</P>
<P>
The other initiatives for export promotion is to launch a
system to lend money to the exporters of those crops on the basis
of receipts showing their transaction in specified warehouses.
</P>
<P>
Uganda now has commercial attaches in Kenya and Tanzania and
the government will appoint more attaches in foreign missions to
promote export, revealed the state minister.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Slightly Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
drifted to a slightly lower close today, supported by the banking
sector and a few key bluechips, with volumes reflecting a lack of
investor interest.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index retreated from opening highs spurred
by a rise on Wall Street overnight to finish the day 1.1 points
lower at 2778.1 points.
</P>
<P>
The looming Telstra Corp float had caused investors to hang off
buying stocks, cashing up instead to take part in the first stage
of privatization of the telecommunications giant, Nevitts broker
Steve Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
"The Telstra float is sucking a bit of money out of the market.
We have seen a little bit of selling for that," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Federal Government announced the 8-10 billion US
dollar float of one third of Telstra with the guarantee that at
least 70 percent of the offer would go to Australian investors.
The offer opens on October 15.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index shaved off 6.0 points to finish at
4556.5 points while the banking sector was buoyed by the National
Australia Bank's (NAB) announcement yesterday that it had bought
the County Natwest Investment Management Ltd, Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
The banking index jumped 52 points to 5479.1. NAB shares were
60 cents stronger at 21.75 Australian dollars, Commonwealth shares
climbed 10 cents to 17.07 Australian dollars, ANZ bank added 11
cents to 11.39 Australian dollars, while Westpac bucked the trend,
dropping five cents to 8.58 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index finished 3.3 points higher at 1380.2,
following stronger gold prices yesterday, Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
The gold index dropped 1.7 points to 1355.5, after yesterday's
surge.
</P>
<P>
Global media company Rupert Murdoch's News Corp finished steady
at 7.00 Australian dollars with its preferred shares easing five
cents to 6.14 Australian dollars. Kerry Packer's Publishing and
Broadcasting slumped nine cents to 9.00 Australian dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Philipines Sign Tax Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has signed a treaty with the
Philipines aimed at avoiding the incidence of double taxation, local
newspaper This Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed in Manila on Monday, is described as a further
step of Nigeria in its determination to enter into economic
cooperation with Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Nigeria's Finance Minister Anthony Ani, the treaty is
a "landmark" in the two countries' bilateral relations and "will create
the stable economic climate conducive to the free flow of trade and
technology" between them.
</P>
<P>
Double taxation has been a huge disincentive to businessmen from
the two countries to invest in the other side.
</P>
<P>
There are now over 15,000 Filipino nationals working in Nigeria in
the fields of education, missionary activities, engineering and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
The Philipines mainly exports jeeps, leather goods, garments and
footwear to Nigeria, while imports petroleum, cotton, chemicals and
refined lead from the latter.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which has been on the negotiation table since 1981,
will help "remove all inhibitions which double taxation normally
imposes on growth of trade and free movement of persons between the
two countries," said Ani.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Nigeria has turned to the east to make new
friends, forced by the difficulties resulted from the sanctions
imposed by its former western allies in Europe and America, and has
benefited from the strategic shift.
</P>
<P>
The country's head of state, General Sani Abacha, said Wednesday
that Nigeria will continue to make new friends in other parts of the
world with those who wish to be friends and cooperate with it on the
basis of mutual understanding, trust and respect.
</P>
<P>
Ani also explained Nigeria's economic shift towards the Southeast
Asian nations, saying that from the many advantage of South-South
coopertion, the Asian countries have middle level technology which is
likely to be easily adapted by Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Nigeria and most of the Asian Tigers were in the same
economic siutation about three decade ago, the minister said, Nigeria
is in a better position to learn from the developmental experience of
these countries.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Suggests Regional Forest Fires Monitoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has proposed the
setting up of a monitoring system at the ASEAN level to prevent
forest fires, Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said
today.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made during a United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) meeting recently, the minister told reporters after
opening the Fourth Conference on Forestry and Forest Products
Research at the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia here.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) groups Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and parts of the
Philippines and Thailand have been blanketed by a thick and smoky
haze generated from the raging forest fires in Indonesia affecting
up to 800,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Lim said, "We should have a monitoring system because these
forest fires are bound to happen again and again." But he did not
say when or how the system would operate.
</P>
<P>
"If you monitor before it becomes big, you can avoid a regional
or international disaster (like the haze)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lim said huge forest fires like the ones in Indonesia could
have been avoided if the situation was closely monitored.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which was worst affected by Indonesia's forest fires,
has sent more than 1,000 firefighters to Indonesia to help put out
the fires.

<P>
LAGOS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will supply 20,000
barrels of crude oil daily to neighbouring Guinea, Mali, Niger,
the Republic of Benin and Cote d'Ivoire, according to term

in the spot market to term contract.
</P>
<P>
While the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation which
controls the country's oil resources favors spot market, the
National Economic Intelligence Committee has been pressing for
term contracts which encourages transparency and accountability,
the report said.
</P>

export estimated at 2.18 million barrels in the first half of

900,000 Egyptian workers with over 84 million U.S. dollars for
their funds frozen in Iraqi banks in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The total of 84,393,992 dollars will be distributed through the
Egyptian government to those claimants, who have been seeking
compensation of funds deposited in Iraqi banks for transfer to
beneficiaries in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of these funds ceased after August 2, 1990.
</P>
<P>
During its 25th session from September 29 to October 1, the
UNCC reviewed the original 1.24 million individual claims by those
Egyptian workers and determined that 223,817 claims did not fall
within the commission's jurisdiction, said a UNCC press release.
</P>
<P>
The UNCC, established in 1991, is a subsidiary organ of the
U.N. Security Council to decide claims submitted by victims of
Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
UNCC's decision on Egyptian workers brings the total number of
claims resolved by the commission to over 2.4 million, out of over
2.6 million filed with the commission since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The total compensation so far approved by the UNCC is over 6
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The next UNCC session is scheduled for December 15-17, 1997,
the press release said.

<HEADLINE> France Offers to Help Algeria Find Political Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- France today offered to help find
a political solution to the six-year-old conflict in Algeria but
attached a condition that all parties there should join the
process.
</P>
<P>
"All the organizations, all the countries which are deeply
saddened by what is going on (in Algeria) cannot but express their
readiness" to join the initiative, said French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
"All the parties, if they want it and if they ask for it," the
top French diplomat told Radio-Television Luxembourg (RTL), should
have a part in the political solution.
</P>
<P>
As regard to the proposed French role in the fresh offer,
Vedrine said it is not "based on the feeling of interference but
on humanity, friendship and solidarity."
</P>
<P>
"Algeria is there. We are there. We should think about the
future, build close relations after all these tragedies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He repeated French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's recent
criticism against the Algerian government for resorting to
force in trying to put down the Muslim insurrection.
</P>
<P>
"There is an extreme violence (in Algeria) and it is true that
the state, which ... is brought to fight an extremely violent
terrorism, employs the force of the state," said Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister also appealed to Algerians to hold
the forthcoming local elections under "the most possibly
incontestable condition."

<HEADLINE> Bovine TB Epidemic in S. African Park No Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The bovine tuberculosis
epidemic sweeping Kruger National Park, which is situated between
South Africa and Mozambique, poses no threat to local animals and
visitors to the park, a conservation expert said.
</P>
<P>
"It's only the older infected animals that die," local daily
The Star quoted the park's senior Conservation Manager Johan van
der Merwe as saying today.
</P>
<P>
A 200km-long, 2.8m-high electrified fence being built around
sections of the park at the cost of seven million Rand (1.48
million U.S. Dollars) would ensure the disease stay within the
park, Merwe said.
</P>
<P>
TB came to the Kruger National Park in the 1960s when a herd
of infected cattle spread the disease to buffalo, said the
manager, adding that only animals in the southern parts of the
park were infected.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic, which posed no danger to human health, could
only be transmitted by drinking the infected cattle's milk which
has not been pasteurized, or by slaughtering diseased cattle
without wearing gloves, Merwe noted.

<P>
MANILA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the Philippine
government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) met
in the southern Philippine city of Cotabato today to discuss
initial ground rules for implementing a general ceasefire in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency said the government panel was led by
Maj. Gen. Joselin Nazareno, chief of the army's 4th Infantry
Division, while the MILF panel was led by Lawyer Omar Umpar.
</P>
<P>
Aside from discussing the ceasefire rules, the report said, the
negotiators will also assess if government troops have complied
with a condition agreed upon by both parties last month in Rajah
Muda, Pikit, Cotabato, for the complete pull-out of troops.
</P>
<P>
The MILF requested an investigation on the matter after reports
said that government troops were still seen in the area.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group warned that it would suspend future talks with
the government if the troops are still there.
</P>
<P>
The MILF became a major threat to peace in Mindanao, the
southern Philippines, following a peace accord between the
government and the rebel Moro National Liberation Front in
September last year.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which has vowed to continue its fight for an
independent state in Mindanao, reached a general ceasefire with
the government in July this year, but rules for the implementation
of the truce have to be discussed and worked out.
</P>
<P>
The current meeting, the eighth in the series of low-level
talks, is expected to end on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Gives Zambia Loans for Road Repairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has given Zambia
a loan of about 91 billion Kwacha (70 million U.S.Dollars) to
finance the initial road repairs in Lusaka as part of the
country-wide exercise under the road sector investment program,
Zambia Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Raymond Jhala, Chairman of the National Roads
Board through which the loan was granted, as saying at a press
briefing Wednesday that the board will from now on carry out
regular maintenance of rehabilitated roads which is not done in
the past contributing to the current high level of deterioration
of the road network.
</P>
<P>
Under the 10-year investment program which was launched with
the repair of Lusaka roads, Zambia will offer regular maintemance
to roads apart from merely rehabilitating them.
</P>
<P>
Most of the roads in Zambia has not been attended to for over
30 years despite the fact that road needs to be rehabilitated
every five years.
</P>
<P>
Jhala said one of the contributing factors to the destruction
of roads is overloaded heavy duty vehicles, and bridges need to
be replaced because they were constructed with ancient
technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that the initial five years of the repair exercise
requirs about 385 million dollars, part of which will be raised
from road users.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Horticulture Exports Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean horticulture
producers exported more than 2,000 tons of cut flower and fresh
produce valued in excess of 120 million Zimbabwe dollars (10
million US Dollars) since the 1997/98 marketing season began in
July.
</P>
<P>
Horticultural Promotion Council (HPC) Chief Executive Stanley
Heri said on Wednesday the marketing season had started well with
418 tons of flower and 1,727 tons of fresh produce exported to
date.
</P>
<P>
"Flowers and fresh produce have earned the industry 58 million
(4.8 million US Dollars) and 64 million Zimbabwe Dollars (5.3
million dollars) respectively and we expect to earn 1.7 billion
Zimbabwe Dollars (141.6 million dollars) this season," Heri said.
</P>
<P>
Estimates in volume terms for the 1997/98 season stood at
17,290 tons and 12,240 tons for flower and fresh produce
respectively, a significant increase from last year's exports,
according to the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Between July 1996 and June 1997, Zimbabwe exported a total of
13,800 tons of cut flowers and 9,800 tons of fresh produce worth
about 1.2 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (about 100 million US
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Competition continued to increase on the international markets
and local growers have been urged to increase production so as to
maximize earnings, in addition to seek for new markets.
</P>
<P>
But a major concern, apart from growing competition, is the
rising freight costs which now constituted over 50 percent of
total input costs for production.
</P>
<P>
At present there are more than 1,000 commercial horticultural
producers registered with HPC.

<HEADLINE> Blasts Rock Indian Train, Killing 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Triple blasts in an Indian
train bound for Amritsar, Punjab, on Wednesday night left at least
seven people dead and another 20 injured, most of them seriously,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Among the injured are four Australians and one Japanese.
</P>
<P>
The three blasts rocked the train within 20 minutes near
Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, which is about 50 kilometers east of New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The first of the series of blasts took place at 8:45 p.m. local
time, the second and most intensive blast occurred ten minutes
later while the last blast was at 9:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The first blast was of low intensity and was in Coach S-6 of
the train. The foreigners injured were traveling in this
compartment.
</P>
<P>
The second blast ripped the coach apart as the train officials
were in the process of getting the passengers evacuated. The blast
was the most damaging, leaving a gaping hole in the floor of the
compartment.
</P>
<P>
Minutes thereafter, when most of the train had been cleared of
passengers, a third blast took place. This was in another coach
and caused some damage to the seats.
</P>
<P>
It was later confirmed that at least seven people had been
killed in the blasts. All the injured have been rushed to
hospitals in Ghaziabad.
</P>
<P>
The police are investigating the nature of the blasts.

<HEADLINE> US to Invoke Super 301 Section on SKorea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has reponded strongly
to the United States' decision on Wednesday to invoke a punitive
trade ruling and force South Korea to open wider its auto market.
</P>
<P>
Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Lim Chang-yuel today
threatened to bring the U.S. move, an escalation of the bilateral
trade disputes, to the World Trade Organization (WTO) for review.
</P>
<P>
The Office of U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) announced its
decision to apply the priority foreign countries practice (PFCP)
designation to South Korea under the so-called Super 301 Section.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral decision was based on U.S. allegations that
South Korea's restrictions on foreign entry into the country's
auto market have not relaxed as requested by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
noted that South Korea's cumulative tariffs and tax disadvantages
against foreign cars have unfavorably influenced car imports.
</P>
<P>
Although some progress was made in recent U.S.-South Korea auto
talks, she said, South Korea is not prepared to formulate the
necessary reform to allow much wider access to its auto market.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has emerged as the world's third largest auto
exporting country, but foreign cars accounted for only 1 percent
of its auto market in 1996 despite the 1995 U.S.-South Korea auto
agreement, the top U.S. trade negotiator added.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Lim Chang-yuel said if the U.S. invocation of
Super 301 hurts South Korea's exports even before the USTR takes
retaliatory measures, Seoul will bring the case to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Seoul and Washington are scheduled to resume their auto talks.
</P>
<P>
But if the two sides fail to strike an agreement within 12-18
months, the USTR will be likely to take retaliatory measures, such
as tariffs and quotas, against South Korea.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials at a meeting in Washington on September 25-30
strongly demanded a wider opening of South Korea's auto market,
saying Seoul's plan to ease foreign access is unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Washington called for a cut in South Korea's auto import tariff
from 8 percent to 2.5 percent, and a change in the country's auto
taxation system from basing on the engine power to the auto price.
</P>
<P>
But South Korea had rejected its demand.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky said South Korea had failed to explain effectively
its complex and expensive type certification procedures for cars,
restrictions on auto financing and a biased view of foreign cars.
</P>
<P>
South Korea exports 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion U.S. dollars in
auto products to the U.S. market annually, and the invocation of
Super 301 will adversely affect these exports.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Goes up in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Kenya rose in
September as the delayed effects of the Shilling depreciation in
August surfaced, according to the latest Central Bank of Kenya
bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The underlying three-month annualized inflation rose to 13.2
percent in September from 4.2 percent in August, while the
underlying month-on-month inflation rose to 6.8 percent from 5.7
percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The overall three-month annualized inflation rose to negative
5.2 percent last month from negative 15.5 percent in August,
while the overall month-on-month inflation rose to 8.8 percent
from 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new tax measures introduced by the government to bridge
the expenditure-revenue gap widened due to the loan suspension of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also contributed to the
inflation, said the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kenya Shilling has gained steadily against other
currencies in September.

<HEADLINE> East Africa Seeks Identical Asylum Legislations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Senior immigration
officials and refugees chiefs of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania have
recommended reconciliation of the existing asylum procedures in
the three east African countries.
</P>
<P>
The officials called for the formation of data banks to record
movements in the region, today's Daily News reported.
</P>
<P>
The officials made the call at a two-day meeting which ended
in Arusha in northern Tanzania on Wednesday. They suggested that
the permanent tripartite committee of the East African
Co-operation work out a mechanism for harmonization of
legislation on all aspects of refugees.
</P>
<P>
They also urged exchange of visits in a bid to enhance
practical handling of matters related to refugees from Rwanda,
Burundi, Somalia and other neighboring countries and asylum
seekers in the region.
</P>
<P>
They advised the east African universities having teaching and
outreach programs on forced immigration to coordinate their
efforts from a regional point of view and make effective use of
the Inter-University Council for EA.
</P>
<P>
The much awaited EA passports, which were originally scheduled
for delivery late last month, has now been shelved to next month.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, however, agreed that final specimens of the
passports be availed to immigration chiefs for approval before
production commences.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was informed that Kenya and Uganda have
re-introduced inter-state passes which are ready for issuance.
Tanzania is also in the process of printing her inter-state
passes, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said the member states have implemented the decision of the
seventh tripartite commission to remove road blocks from
desinated EA cooperation networks subject to maintaining
temporary ones required for security measures.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Garment Export to Rise 20 Percent A Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The volume of ready-made garment
(RMG) export from Bangladesh is likely to increase at a rate of 20
percent per annum up to 2005.
</P>
<P>
This statement was made Wednesday at a meeting by Mostofa Golam
Quddus, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and
Exports Association (BGMEA).
</P>
<P>
The RMG sector had earned over three billion U.S. dollars in
the last 1996-97 fiscal year which constituted about 68 percent of
Bangladesh's total export earnings, the BGMEA chief stated, adding
the sector had brought about a tremendous prospect for the
investment in weaving sector with its own progress.
</P>
<P>
"The RMG sector has ensured the use of over 2.6 billion yards
(about 2.38 billion meters) of fabric annually and demand of it is
increasing every year at a rate of 20 percent," he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that about 60 percent of woven fabrics
now used in the RMG sector are imported.
</P>
<P>
Tremendous possibilities had been created for foreign investors
to invest in Bangladesh because of non-availability of domestic
capital and gradual increase of use of fabrics in the RMG sector,
the BGMEA president said.
</P>
<P>
"Favorable investment infrastructure, low inflation rate,
easily trainable vast labor force and flourishment of some new
generation entrepreneurs have turned the country's RMG sector into
the highest prospective investment focal point in South Asia," the
BGMEA chief stated.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Hold Referendum in Eastern Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Cabinet has
decided a referendum will be held in two major cities in Eastern
province for the people there to decide whether to merge with
Northern province or not, Justice Minister G.L. Peiris said here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly news conference, the minister said
President Chandrika Kumaratunga and all the 29 government
ministers attending Monday's special cabinet meeting had agreed to
hold a referendum in Trincomalee and Batticaloa, two of the
biggest cities in Eastern province.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after the cabinet devoted five hours to
discussing the devolution proposals, a package aimed at realizing
peace with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) by granting
more autonomy to Northern and Eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
Peiris said that the move is for the people there, the majority
of whom are Tamils, to decide whether they will merge with
Northern province or not. In Eastern province, the Tamils make up
41 percent of the population, the Muslims 32.2 percent and the
Sinhalese 24.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister didn't specify when and how the referendum will be
held.
</P>
<P>
He said if the people in the two cities choose not to merge
with the north, the government will take steps to maintain the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting an ethnic war with the government
for a separate state of their own in the north and east of the
country, where Tamils make up almost two-thirds of the total
population with Sinhalese occupying 13.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the whole nation, Sinhalese make up about 74 percent of the
population and Tamils come to 18 percent.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Caught Between Coalition Allies, Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyuhd has been caught between coalition allies and
influential factions in his own New Aspiration Party in the issue
of a cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Chatichai Choonhavan, former prime minister and leader of the
Chart Pattana Party, the second largest party in the government,
said Wednesday that without a quick reshuffle of the cabinet the
country's economy will suffer further damage, and a reshuffle
could not wait because the economy was at stake.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chavalit is facing intense lobbying from ministers
who are considered to be likely to be replaced in the expected
shake-up.
</P>
<P>
Among those badly attacked in the censure debate last week was
Deputy Prime Minister Sukhavich Rangsitpol, who was alleged to be
involved in irregularities in the purchase of computers for
schools.
</P>
<P>
There has been pressure to dismiss him from the cabinet, but
the prime minister finds it hard to remove him, as he is a deputy
leader of the prime minister's New Aspiration Party and has the
support of a faction, known as the August 17 faction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister is selecting suitable non-MP

of mismanagement of the economy.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah Falls to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rupiah plunged again
Wednesday to record low as the stock exchange bore the brunt of
the worsening currency crisis, dealers and brokers said today.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah slumped to a new low of 3,470 against the U.S.
dollar in the morning session before recovering to 3,370/3,400 at
close against 3,270/90 on opening.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the rupiah's drop to the rise of the dollar
overnight rates in the local market, the sharp fall of other
regional currencies and the high demand for the American dollar.
</P>
<P>
Overnight rates for the American dollar increased to 20 percent
Wednesday from less than 10 percent previously.
</P>
<P>
The rise of overnight rates will surely attract more people to
buy the dollar, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, almost all Southeast Asian currencies plunged to
their new lows Wednesday amid scenes not witnessed since the Thai
baht's shocking flotation in early July.
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, the currency upheaval is entering its
second phase.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia (central bank) Governor Soedradjad Djiwandono
said Wednesday night that the rupiah's fall this week was largely
due to the increase in the demand for American dollars from local
companies.
</P>
<P>
He said many companies bought dollars to pay their
dollar-denominated debts.
</P>
<P>
According to data from business consulting firm the Castle
Group, Indonesian private offshore debt reached 55.52 billion U.S.
dollars last year, of which about 34.24 billion dollars would
mature in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
Stock trading bore the brunt of the worsening currency crisis,
with the composite index, the main price barometer at the Jakarta
Stock Exchange, losing 1.77 percent to close at 536.99 points
after a slight increase the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts said the market would remain bearish in the
short-term due to continued uncertainty in the currency market and
the weakening rupiah.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Facing Crisis Over Draft Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Despite a possible collapse of his
center-left coalition, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi today
rejected demands from his ally -- the Communist Refoundation party
-- to re-write his 1998 draft budget.
</P>
<P>
"I always keep the dialogue open but in the firmness of the
contents of the budget," Prodi told reporters after more than one
hour of talks with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who has the
sole right to dissolve parliament.
</P>
<P>
Prodi unveiled the draft budget at the weekend, which the
government considers essential to secure Italy's membership of the
single European currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
But Refoundation, a hard-left party which has ensured Prodi's
majority in the Lower House, says the budget contains unacceptable
cuts in welfare and pensions.
</P>
<P>
Refoundation's decision to oppose the 25-trillion-lira budget
put in jeopardy both the budget and the future of the 17-month-old
Prodi government.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there were room for negotiation, Prodi said, "I don't
know. I hope there is room for reason."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted, "It is impossible to re-write the budget,
which was thought out by the entire government. But Adaptations
are possible."
</P>
<P>
Prodi also rejected the option of forming a new parliamentary
majority, saying he had come to power with "a clear program and a
clear majority."
</P>
<P>
Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi told the Senate
this evening that Italy had made progress in its economic
development in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
He noted that interest rates and inflation have been falling
and the deficit-gross domestic product ratio has declined from
seven percent to a level "fully compatible with the three percent
called for in the Maastricht Treaty."
</P>
<P>
However, the political crisis is unfavorable to Prodi
government because the Refoundation party is insisting that talks
with the government can begin only when the government withdraw
the draft budget.
</P>
<P>
And the opposition parties are busy assessing the political
prospect and contacting each other in a bid to coordinate their
moves.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Consumer Prices Increase in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices in Thailand were
up 7 percent year-on-year in September, compared with 6.5 percent
for the previous month, according to the Thai commerce ministry.
</P>
<P>
Inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) was 4.5
percent in the first half of the year, but was expected to head
toward double digits by the end of the year because of the impact
of the baht's depreciation, the ministry was quoted today by local
press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The CPI for the first nine months of this year showed a rise of
5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Narong chai Akrasanee predicted the
year-on-year index would be kept below 7 percent as required by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in exchange for its
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
A 1-percent rise in the non-food sector and a decline of 0.1
percent in the food and beverage sector were factors in the
increase between August and September.
</P>
<P>
Also, due to the value-added tax increase from 7 percent to 10
percent on August 16, there had been sharp price rises for
clothes, some services, oil, building materials and stationery.

<HEADLINE> Thai Commerce Minister Urges Rice Export Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Thai Commerce Minister
Narongchai Akrasanee has proposed forcing Thai rice farmers,
millers and exporters to register their product to prevent
adulteration, a ministry source said today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is aimed at registering the origin of fragrant
rice, also known as jasmine rice, in order to control the quality
of rice, which is one of the major agricultural exports of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, if supported by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Cooperatives, will be the first one in Thailand to register the
origin of its agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
High overseas demand, particularly in East Asia, has pushed up
the export price of Thai fragrant rice to over 750 U.S. Dollars
per ton, about 300 dollars more per ton than other types of white
rice.
</P>
<P>
The commerce minister has been deeply concerned about the
rampant adulteration of fragrant rice with low-quality rice.
</P>
<P>
Although the depreciation of the baht has resulted in favorable
export prices, the rampant adulteration of fragrant rice has
dented the image of Thai fragrant rice exporters, leading to
cancellation of orders for fragrant rice in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Commerce Ministry proposed that millers and
exporters use 5-kg package, instead of 100-kg sacks, to prevent
adulteration during the re-packaging process.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Add Nothing to Financial Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will add nothing to its
financial liberalization program under the General Agreement of
Trade in Services (GATS due to be signed in December in Geneva,
Thai Deputy Finance Minister Chaovarat Charnveerakul said.
</P>
<P>
The GATS will cover market access, national treatment and
regulations, and service liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Chaovarat made the comment Wednesday after his meeting with a
12-member delegation from the US-ASEAN Business Council which has
formed a group to study ways of investing in high-potential
countries, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Even though the delegation wants Thailand to liberalize to a
greater extent than it did under the temporary GATS reached in
1995, Chaovarat insisted that the country had nothing to add to
what had been agreed then, given the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Thailand needed to upgrade its systems to
control and examine the local financial institutions before
deciding to make the country's financial sector more open and
free.
</P>
<P>
The commitments made in 1995 include allowing foreign investors
to hold up to 25 percent in Thai financial institutions, the
opening of the Bangkok International Banking Facilities, and an
attempt to award more licenses to set up commercial banks.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Enrique Cardoso called on South American countries to show more
concern over their social problems, Chilean newspapers reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Chilean press, Cardoso said that
eliminating social inequality and improving the living standard of
the people, the quality of education and the political situation
should receive their top priority.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso arrived in Santiago on Tuesday to attend a meeting of
the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), which is a
semi-governmental organization established in 1980 and comprising
22 countries and regions on the Pacific rim. Brazil is one of the
three observer countries of the PECC.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian president noted that as the United States is not
paying enough attention to these problems, "so it is up to us" to
solve them.
</P>
<P>
On the future of the South American Common Market (Mercosur),
Cardoso said that Mercosur grows faster than any other trade bloc
on the American Continent.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, the largest trading bloc in South America, groups
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Chile and Bolivia are
associated members.
</P>
<P>
"Trade between Brazil and Argentina went up from 3 billion
U.S. dollars to 15 billion dollars in a period of just four to
five years," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to the forthcoming 2nd Summit of Americas to be held next
April in Santiago, Cardoso said, "I think it is all up to us to
work out an agenda which will include something more than taxes
and tariffs."

<P>
The Brazilian president also called for a permanent seat for
Latin America in the United Nations Security Council.

BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will need to cut
another 100 billion baht (2.74 billion U.S. dollars) from its
fiscal 1998 budget to meet the target set by the International

<HEADLINE> Mongolian President Calls for Crackdown on Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandy on Wednesday urged the Great Hural (parliament) and
government to take concrete measures to fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the fall session of the Great Hural,
Bagabandy said that embezzlement and misappropriation have become
rampant in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He added that about 3,000 units have illegally spent a total of
19.9 billion togrog (about 25 million U.S. dollars) in the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural and government must take concrete measures to
contain this situation, said the president.
</P>
<P>
On the macro-economic situation, Bagabandy said that the
country has been successful in stabilizing the economy and
creating better environment for the development of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that production continued to decline and
unemployment and poverty became more serious. As many as 19.2
percent of the population are still living in poverty, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government should take measures to help the enterprises out
of difficulty, said Bagabandy.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Spies Using Canadian Passports Unacceptable: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said today that it would be totally unacceptable for any
foreign spies to use Canadian passports.
</P>
<P>
Chretien made the comment in the House of Commons today when he
was asked about two Canadian passport holders arrested in Jordan
over an attempted murder of a leader of the Islamic militant group
Hamas.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is completely unacceptable to this government that
anybody authorized by the government would use the Canadian
passport to perpetrate any illegal action as they have done,"
Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
He told the lawmakers that the Canadian authorities are talking
to officials in Israel and in Jordan to find out what had happened.
</P>
<P>
Hamas political chief Khaled Meshal was assaulted outside his
office in Amman last Thursday and the two attackers are reported
to be agents of Israel's secret service Mossad.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said he will
discuss the issue with Jordan's foreign minister Thursday in New
York.
</P>
<P>
"I know it's a matter I have to treat seriously and that it's
of some concern to us that Canadian passports were being used in
this matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to find out exactly what took place and who is involved
and why," Axworthy noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters that he would speak to Jordanian
officials before talking to Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to take appropriate actions to make sure that the
integrity of the Canadian passport system be preserved.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Condemn SFOR's Seisure of Transmission Relays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb
member of Bosnia's Presidency, and Bosnian Serb government in Pale
on Wednesday condemned the multinational Stabilization Force's
taking control of three radio and television transmission relay
stations.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Karlos Vestendorp, high international
commissioner in Bosnia, the SFOR blockaded the relay stations in
Trebeviche, Udrigovo and Modrica on Wednesday morning, the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
Javier Solana, secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, said in Maastricht, the Netherlands, that the move
was designed to assist Vestendorp in ensuring that the media in
the Bosnian Serb republic reflects international norms of
professional media conduct and fully supports the goals of the
Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb government held a meeting on the matter on
Wednesday, saying that the SFOR action is a premeditated move
designed to place the media under the control of Bosnian Serb
President Biljana Plavsic, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The local Bosnian Serb media loyal to war-time leader Radovan
Karadzic was blamed by NATO and other Western organizations as
inciting unrest against international presence.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic's successor, Plavsic, has the backing of the West.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said that the SFOR move could lead to uncontrolled
moves of Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The Pale Radio-TV Director Miroslav Tohol said his staff would
take some non-military measures such as a hunger strike to protest
the SFOR action, said the report.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Orders Alabama Department to Stop Segregation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge has ordered
the Department of Transportation of Alabama, the United States, to
stop segregating work crews, a practice the department continued
as it battled a 12-year-old racial discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson in Montgomery ruled Tuesday
that segregated crews violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act, after
hearing a department division engineer testify about the all-black
and all-white crews.
</P>
<P>
Dalmus Lamar Davidson, responding to questions from an attorney
for black employees, said some workers of both races preferred the
segregated crews.
</P>
<P>
"There are individuals both black and white that want to stay
with either black or white crews," The Associated Press today
quoted Davidson, who is white, as saying.
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Thompson said that crew assignments should not
be based on the racial preferences of employees. He ordered the
department to report to him by October 8 on steps taken to end the
policy.
</P>
<P>
Black employees sued 12 years ago, alleging racial bias in
hiring and promotions.
</P>
<P>
The state reached an agreement in 1994 to expand efforts to
hire and promote blacks. But black employees contend the state
has not lived up to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
In April, Thompson ordered the department to pay about 2,000
black employees some 34 million dollars in back pay. The state is
appealing.
</P>
<P>
The current phase of the trial is to determine what jobs, if
any, some black employees are entitled to as a result of
discrimination.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Albanians Stage Demonstrations in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic Albanians staged a mass
anti-government demonstration today in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, prompting a quick condemnation from the Serbian government.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators, including students, teachers and some former
government officials, gathered in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo,
and six other areas of the province.
</P>
<P>
They were later dispersed by police using rubber bullets and
tear gas. Violent conflicts were reported in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, the Serbian government issued a
statement, denouncing the act as an attempt to split up the
country under the guise of ethnic issues.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the province's
population, have long been in conflict with Serbians.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo had been an autonomous province with its own provincial
assembly and government until 1990. After its autonomous status
was removed, ethnic Albanian politicians proclaimed Kosovo a
"republic".
</P>
<P>
The act was declared illegal by the Serbian and federal
authorities, who have since condemned any attempt to break up the
country and any foreign interference on the issue.

RIO DE JANEIRO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government
will appoint Federal Police attaches to its embassies in
Argentina, Paraguay and Colombia, in an effort to facilitate the
exchange of information on crime investigation.
</P>
<P>
Brazil chose Argentina and Paraguay for crime investigation
because of their common partnership in the Southern Common Market
(Mercosur) while it picked Colombia because the frontier they
share is a main corridor for drug and weapons trafficking,
according to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
In another development, U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) is looking forward to install a representation office in
Brasilia, where its agents will work as "observers," Brazilian
Police director Vicente Helotti was quoted by the press as
saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of a 300
million U.S. dollar loan to Brazil to help its highway improvement
program.
</P>
<P>
The main component of the project is the rehabilitation of some
6,800 kilometers of paved roads. The project, the total cost of
which is estimated at 750 million dollars, is designed to reduce
transportation and road maintenance costs throughout the country,
improving international competitiveness and integration with the
countries of Mercosur, the southern South American common market.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is providing some 300 million dollars in
co-financing. Local counterpart funds total 150 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the IDB already approved a 115 million
dollar loan to the state of Ceara and 150 million dollars to the
state of Rio Grande do Sul for highway improvements in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Urge Reversal of Decline Trend of Aid Flows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Development of the South
was not only an investment in peace and security but would clearly
rebound to the advantages of the countries of the North in the
long run, Abdus Samad Azad, foreign minister of Bangladesh, said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 52nd session of the General Assembly, the
foreign minister said global Official Development Aid flows
continued to slump and this trend must be reversed.
</P>
<P>
He said development of the South would mean bigger markets for
the exports of the countries of the North.
</P>
<P>
Azad said the plight of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs)
called for very careful consideration and had in the past merited
a special place and focus in the international agenda.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that two major international
conferences on LDCs had been held in the 80s and 90s and important
decisions and programs of actions adopted. The implementation of
those had been disappointing, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Third UN Conference on LDCs should be held in the
year 2000 to chart the course of global support for these weakest
members at the start of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
He urged special consideration and concessions for LDCs to
enable them to meet World Trade Organization deadlines.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also urged all major LDCs concerns to be
given most favorable consideration at the forthcoming high level
meeting in Geneva next month.

WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The State Department said
today that it opposes Israel on its decision to continue
settlement construction activity.
</P>
<P>
"We've never accepted that proposition," spokesman James Foley
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has held the consistent view that "settlement
activity is unhelpful and is counterproductive to the effort to
achieve a negotiated settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli
dispute," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the
Jewish state would not change its policy of construction activity
to accommodate natural growth.

<HEADLINE> US Gov't Files Charges Against Unfair Trade Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today
accused South Korea, Japan, Canada, the European Union and
Australia of unfair trade practices, kicking off a process that
could lead to trade sanctions against them.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky said she would also initiate the World Trade
Organization (WTO) cases against Japan on fruit, Canada and Europe
on dairy practices and against Australia on automotive leather.
</P>
<P>
The charge against South Korea for not opening big enough the
auto market came following long-time negotiations held over the
past several days in which the South Koreans sought to keep from
being singled out under a provision of the U.S. trade law known as
Super 301.
</P>
<P>
Under the provision, the president will be allowed to launch
investigations of unfair trade practices against countries and to
impose punitive tariffs if negotiations fail to remove the
barriers.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky announced that such a case was being brought against
South Korea because negotiations between the two countries had
failed to resolve all of the U.S. complaints.
</P>
<P>
She said that despite South Korea's commitments in 1995, sales
of foreign cars made up less that 1 percent of the South Korean
market.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States did not bring a case against Japan
on autos.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky also noted that the Super 301 review demonstrated
the administration's commitment to ensuring that other countries
live up to their commitments to remove trade barriers.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Panel Backs Clinton's Trade Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Senate panel voted
today to give President Bill Clinton special trade negotiating
powers, the first step toward approval of the authority the White
House requested to negotiate new trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Finance Committee approved the measure by voice vote
with no public discussion.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with the action taken today by the Senate
Finance Committee," U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
said. "It was a strong bipartisan showing of support for fast
track legislation, for the power of the president to continue to
lead with respect to international economic policy."
</P>
<P>
The fast approval before the Finance Committee sends the
measure to an uncertain future in Congress. Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott expressed concerns today about lack of Democratic
support in the Senate and House Speaker Newt Gingrich has said
that no more than 14 House Democrats are currently willing to
publicly commit to support for the proposal.
</P>
<P>
But the Clinton administration insists that it will begin to
pick up more support as business interests begin to make the case
for expanding free trade.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is seeking the so-called fast-track
negotiating authority to expand the North American Free Trade
Agreement with Mexico to other countries in Latin America and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
But he has been criticized by labor unions and environmental
groups for emphasizing trade agreements over worker rights and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating authority allows the U.S. president to
negotiate trade agreements that the U.S. Congress can vote for or
against but not amend. The special authority owned by the U.S.
president expired in 1994 and President Clinton's request for
renewal has been controversial.

<HEADLINE> US House Panel Approves Emergency Bill to Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Education and
Workforce Committee today approved overwhelmingly an emergency
measure to help college students and graduates refinance their
student loans.
</P>
<P>
The measure, approved by a 43-0 vote in the committee, would
enable students to refinance their direct loans through private
lenders instead of the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
It was in response to severe problems the department and its
contractor, Electronic Data Systems Corporation, have had in
coping with a flood of applications.
</P>
<P>
The department in late August had to quit taking requests to
refinance its direct loans due to a backlog of tens of thousands
of applications.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which will be taken up by the full House later this
month and considered by the Senate after that, let borrowers get
the same favorable interest rates offered in the direct program.
</P>
<P>
The problems aroused dispute between the Republicans and the
Democrats. Republicans said the refinancing problems show that the
department cannot manage the direct lending program. They favor
the older, guaranteed-loan program that benefits private lenders
with an interest-rate subsidy.
</P>
<P>
Democrats support the direct lending program. They said the
bill should be a temporary relief measure.

<HEADLINE> Confusion Over Albright's Comments on Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Confusion over Israeli
settlements occurred today when Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright called Israeli settlements "legal" and the State
Department made a hasty statement that that does not mean any
reverse of U.S. policy on the issue.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview about Jewish settlement activity in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Albright said, "It's legal."
</P>
<P>
But her spokesman James Rubin said the secretary of state did
not intend to change U.S. policy, which for many years has
refrained from making a sweeping judgment on the status of
settlements under international law.
</P>
<P>
Her answer was "in the context of a discussion of what (the
1993) Oslo (peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians) does
and does not permit, not what the American position is on the
legality (under international Law) of settlements," Rubin said on
NBC television.
</P>
<P>
"All she meant by that was that as a technical matter, Oslo
does not prohibit the settlements.... We're talking here about
housing in Efrat (a West Bank city), we're not talking about new
settlements," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is clear: settlement activity is a complicating
factor and in several instances we have made clear that it's
unhelpful to creating an environment for peace talks," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Dow industrials was pushed
back above 8,000 today as the first major September economic data
reinforced the belief in low inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 70.24 points to 8,015.50,
the first finish above 8,000 since August 20. The blue-chip
barometer is up more than 24 percent in 1997, but still sits about
240 points below its August 6 peak of 8,259.31.
</P>
<P>
Several other stock indicators also set new highs as interest
rates fell toward their lowest level in more than one year in the
bond market.
</P>
<P>
Bonds rallied in the morning after a report about manufacturing
activity suggesting that inflationary pressures at the nation's
factories didn't worsen last month.
</P>
<P>
Smaller company shares extended their record-setting rally. The
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies closed at a record high
for the third straight session and 20th time in 25 sessions.
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange composite index, which is dominated
by secondary stocks, took its first-ever trip above 700, and the
New York Stock Exchange composite index, which has a large
constituency of smaller and mid-sized companies, closed above 500
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 597.89
million shares as against 586.79 million in the previous session.
