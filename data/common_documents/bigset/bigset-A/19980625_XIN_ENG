<HEADLINE> New Drug to Treat Tuberculosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A new drug to treat
tuberculosis has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The drug, rifapentine, was approved fro pulmonary tuberculosis,
a highly contagious and potentially deadly lung infection.
</P>
<P>
Strains of tuberculosis resistant to front-line antibiotics have
been emerging around the world. The World Health Organization
estimated there will be 90 million new cases of tuberculosis and
30 million deaths in the 1990s. According to the Centers for
Disease control, about 19,000 cases were diagnosed in the United
States in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A major benefit of the new drug is that it reduces the number
of treatments needed to cure TB, making it more likely the patient
will complete the therapy. Using drugs improperly to treat TB can
quickly promote the evolution of bacteria that are impervious to
these medicines.
</P>
<P>
The drug will be marketed under the name Priftin by Hoechst
Marion Roussell of Kansas City, Mo. The United States is the first
country to approve the drug.

<HEADLINE> China to Establish New Rural Pension Insurance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Wang Yicai, an official from the
Ministry of Civil Affairs, said today that China will establish a
new rural pension insurance system within the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ongoing international seminar on China's social
security, Wang said the goal of the new system will be to overcome
the aging problem expected early next century.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's rural areas have entered the
market-oriented economy which has replaced the traditional
collective economy. Chinese farmer families of today are
independent working units rather than simply workers on collective
farms.
</P>
<P>
The existing pension system supported by collective farms will
fail to fulfill the requirements to provide sufficient social
security pensions for the elderly in the next century, according
to Wang.
</P>
<P>
The old system will become less effective as the country faces
a serious aging problem resulting from the declining birth rate,
said Wang, adding that the elderly farmers in smaller families
not only rely on the younger generation, but also need support
from social insurance.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the time for replacing the traditional system
of relying on the younger generation for support, which has been
popular in China's rural areas for thousands of years, with the
personal savings insurance system, has arrived.
</P>
<P>
The latter system will help and encourage elderly farmers
protect and support themselves with personal savings, said Aaron.
</P>
<P>
World Bank expert Henry Aaron noted that China's pension reform
will be one of the most difficult economic reform projects in the
history of the world history. However, he pointed out that China
is extending great effort to introduce the system.
</P>
<P>
The rural pension of the future will be built into an insurance
system based on personal savings and partially supported by
financial aid from the collective and government departments,
according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 87.5 percent of farmers responding to a
recent survey regard the pension insurance system based on
personal saving as acceptable, with 93.3 percent expressing their
willingness to participate.
</P>
<P>
China has raised a total of 14 billion yuan in pension
insurance funds from more than 82 million rural people, according
to the survey.

<HEADLINE> EU to Continue Humanitarian Aid to Kosovo: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior European Commission
official reiterated Wednesday that the European Union will
continue humanitarian assistance to Kosovo despite the access
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Hans van den Broek, European commissioner responsible for
external relations with European countries, made the remark after
meeting Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in the
commission headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union is following the situation in Kosovo with
keen interest," said Van den Broek, who added that the 15-nation
union offers humanitarian and political support for a political
solution.
</P>
<P>
But the commissioner said that the first and foremost concrete
step toward improvement of the situation in Kosovo was withdrawal
of the Yugoslav security forces by Slobodan Milosevic, president
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that if Milosevic would not come forward
to meet the international demand, the situation in Kosovo could
get out of control.
</P>
<P>
"There is the risk of spillover of violence leading up to
catastrophy that the European Union would remain unaffected from,"
said the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Rugova asked the West to provide an international protectorate
in Kosovo and he appealed to the European Union for outside
pressure on Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
He urged political and economic pressures by Western countries
to stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek, however, stated that the approach of the
international community was well-known that it wants Kosovo to
remain within Yugoslavia but the European Union would not allow
ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
The union, the commissioner said, stands for a substantial
autonomy of Kosovo that had been withdrawn by Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Rugova said that he would try to get under control of the
Kosovar Liberation Army so that Belgrade could not use it as an
excuse for continued violence.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leader also visited the NATO
headquarters earlier in the day.

<P>
LYON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- France qualified into the second round
as Group C winners after edging Denmark 2-1 here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The French team needed just a draw to secure their top position
in the group and they rested several usual starters and sent in
reservers like Bernard Diomede, Frank Leboeuf and Patrick Vieira.
</P>
<P>
Yet the host team still managed to take a 1-0 lead as David
Trezeguet was brought down by Danish defender and Youri Djorkaeff
converted the penalty shot at the 12th minute.
</P>
<P>
Danmark then fought back fiercely and they could have scored the
equaliser at the 34th minute but French goal-keeper Fabien Barthez
denied Brian Laudrup's attempt.
</P>
<P>
But Denmark also got a penalty at the 42nd minute and this time
Barthez failed to block the shot from Brian's brother Michael
Laudrup.
</P>
<P>
Only 11 minutes into the second half, the French team surged
ahead again thanks to a goal from Emmanuel Petit. The host team
managed to keep the one-goal advantage to the end.
</P>
<P>
France qualified as the group winners with a perfect record by
winning all three group matches. Denmark also qualified with four
points from one win, one draw and one loss.
</P>
<P>
In the other match played at Bordeaux, South Africa salvaged a
2-2 draw with Saudi Arabia with a last-minute penalty.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Child-Support Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Calling unpaid child support a
"quiet crisis" in American families, U,S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday signed legislation that makes it a federal felony to
cross state lines to evade child-support payments.
</P>
<P>
"The quiet crisis of unpaid child support is something that our
country and our families shouldn't tolerate. Our first
responsibility, all of us, is to our children," Clinton said in an
Oval Office signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"One way or the other, people who don't support their children
will pay what they must," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998, felony
punishment would apply if the amount owed by deadbeat parents was
5,000 dollars or more and the payments were more than a year
delinquent.
</P>
<P>
Parents owing 10,000 dollars or more or those who fail to pay
for two years could face up to two years in prison. Parents also
could face fines and would be responsible for making restitution
for unpaid child support.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by lawmakers of both parties, the bill passed both
chambers by overwhelming margins.
</P>
<P>
Current law makes it only a misdemeanor to cross state lines to
avoid payments.
</P>
<P>
Under a tracking system created by the 1996 welfare law, the
administration has identified more than 1 million parents who are
delinquent in child-support obligations.

UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to the

fragments recovered in March from a destruction site at Nibai,

"If this is confirmed by the U.N. inspection team, it's going
to be very difficult for Iraq to convince the international
community that sanctions should be lifted," Richardson said on
ABC's "Good Morning America" program.
</P>
<P>
"What I believe the U.N. inspection team has done is that it
has united all of the countries within the Security Council to
recognize that we still have a lot to do on the disarmament
question with Iraq, and that we cannot have sanctions lifted
because there is no way that Iraq is complying," he said.

Financial analysts in Frankfurt meanwhile noted that an
alliance with Postbank, which has 10 million customers and a
balance sheet of 112 billion German marks (62 billion U.S.
dollars), would help boost Commerzbank's position in the domestic
market and would help it fence off a possible takeover by its

<HEADLINE> Romania: Groups Call for Attention to Reproductive Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Women's health advocacy groups
in Romania have called on the government and the society in
general to pay more attention on reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
Alerted by the gloomy overall picture of reproductive health in
the country, the groups highlighted the fact that improved health
status of mothers is for the good of the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics cited by a report in the newspaper Curierul National
on Wednesday show that an average Romanian woman could have three
to four abortions during her life time, the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
That high rate subsequently preys on women's health, evident in
the fact that about one fifth of Romanian women at child-bearing
ages have problems in getting pregnant again or in child birth.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, infant mortality and reproduction deaths in Romania
are among the highest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Behind these problems are most, or 78 percent, Romanian women's
reluctance to take any contraceptive measures.
</P>
<P>
To change the status around, health experts said, the
government and the public should work together to reshape public
opinions and channel more funding into reproductive health care.
</P>
<P>
Associated with advocacy groups, these experts also urged the
government to better finance the 241 family planning clinics
nationwide and make contraceptive products more affordable.

<HEADLINE> Late Spot Kick Gives South Africa Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BORDEAUX, France, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A last-minute penalty kick
gave South Africa a 2-2 draw with Saudi Arabia in group C here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both teams were out of the World Cup finals after the game which
saw a total of three penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
South Africa opened the scoring the 19th minute through Shaun
Bartlett, the Capetown Spurs striker who blasted the ball from right
in the penalty area past keeper Mohammed Al-Deayea.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia equalized in the 45th minute when Sami Al-Jaber
converted a penalty kick awarded after Youssef Al-Thyniyan was brought
down by Olympique Marseille's Pierre Issa in the area.
</P>
<P>
Another good chance for Saudi Arabia also came from Al-Jaber, who
lobbed the ball in the 28th minute but South African keeper Hank Vonk
lifted the shot over the crossbar.

The Saudis were given a second penalty kick in the 74th minute when
Ibrahahim Al-Sharani was fouled in the area. Youssef Al-Thyniyan shot
the ball home from the spot.
</P>
<P>
When the Saudi Arabia seemed to secure their first win in the
tournament, referee Mario Yanten gave the South Africans a penalty
kick in the 90th minute.
</P>
<P>
Bartlett scored his second goal by shotting the ball into the upper
left corner of the net.

<HEADLINE> Transport Improved in Ethiopia's Amhara Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- About 10 million passengers
were transported by vehicles in the first nine months of 1997/98
in northern Amhara national region, compared to eight million in
the same period of previous year.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency Wednesday quoted Berehane Tsehay, an
official from the region, as attributing the increase of
passengers to the rise in the number of transport vehicles from
200 to 293.
</P>
<P>
Amhara is the second largest nationality in Ethiopia after
Omoro. The transport sector has made progress in the region over
the past three years, with the construction of terminals in
Gondar, Baher Dar and Debre Markos aimed at facilitating
conditions for transport services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the daily flights from Baher Dar, capital city of
the region, have grown from two to six and are linking towns
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the construction of a new airport in Lalibela and
the renovation of the Gondar-Azezo airport are expected to
bolster flight services in the region. There are now three
standard airports and eight airstrips in the region.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Trade Gap Shows Hard Landing Sign for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain's trading balance with the
rest of the world swung sharply into the red in the first three
months of this year, as the crisis in Asia and the strong pound
bit deep into its exports.
</P>
<P>
The current account recorded a 3.2 billion pound (5.72 billion
U.S. dollar) deficit between January and March, the first negative
figure for five quarters and the highest level for six years,
according to the latest official data.
</P>
<P>
The figures by the Office for National Statistics (ONS)
prompted warnings from some of the City economists of a "hard
landing" for the UK economy.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the data, John O'sullivan of NatWest Markets
said, "The eight-year trend of improving external balances has
shifted decisively into reverse."
</P>
<P>
Others claimed "two economies" are developing in Britain -- a
booming domestic and service sector as well as the manufacturing
and export sector which faces cutbacks in orders and recession.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry warned that after
recording the first current-account surplus since 1985 last year,
the UK's external position was set to worsen dramatically this
year.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting a large current-account deficit of 8.8
billion pounds (14.08 billion dollars) this year," a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
ONS statisticians said that large reductions throughout all
areas of the current account, from trade to investment income,
accounted for the decline in the balance.
</P>
<P>
They pinned much of the blame for the bad figures on an
unusually large 2.1 billion pound (3.36 billion dollar) transfer
to the European Union -- in order to meet a call for funds for the
Common Agricultural Policy.
</P>
<P>
However, they conceded that the underlying position on the
balance of payments has deteriorated. A key feature was the surge
in the travel deficit to 1.7 billion pounds (2.72 billion
dollars), the highest on record.
</P>
<P>
Income from tourism took a tumble as the strength of sterling
discouraged foreign visitors, while British residents spent a
record 4.8 billion pounds (7.68 billion dollars) abroad.
</P>
<P>
The overall trade deficit on goods and services ballooned to
4.7 billion pounds (7.52 billion dollars) over the quarter, the
worst figures since the second quarter of 1990.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating trade position with countries in Southeast
Asia and Japan accounted for 1.4 billion pounds (2.24 billion
dollars) of the trade deficit, the ONS figures showed.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment income has also been affected by the
crisis, as UK companies have seen profits on Asian operations
decline.
</P>
<P>
City analysts said the current account was heading for a
deficit of about 1 percent of GDP for the year.
</P>
<P>
The reappearance of a current-account deficit was probably also
the most dramatic sign of the damage being wrought by the strong
pound, they added.

<HEADLINE> India's Two Opposition Parties Merged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Samajwadi Party (SP), or
Socialist party, broke away from the United Front Wednesday and
joined hands with The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), or National
People's Party, to form a new political front.
</P>
<P>
SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav and RJD President Laloo Prasad
Yadav said at a joint press conference here that their move was
necessitated as the United Front failed to fight communal forces
and became "irrelevant."
</P>
<P>
The new party, Rashtriya Loktantrik Morcha (RLM), or National
Democratic Front, would support Congress party in its efforts to
replace the government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),
they said.
</P>
<P>
They appealed to all secular parties to join the new front and
ensure an early exit of the BJP-led government.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said they had to take the initiative for
forging a new front as they had great responsibility in the
populous states of Uttar Pradesh, the SP's power base, and Bihar,
the RJD's power base, to save the country from disintegration.
</P>
<P>
The SP has 20 parliament members in Lok Sabha, the lower house
of the Indian Parliament, and the RJD has 17.
</P>
<P>
Charging the central government with failure on both domestic
and foreign fronts, the leaders said the BJP is keen on promoting
its own interest rather than working for the country's good and it
has thus no right to remain in power.
</P>
<P>
They accused the government of not protecting the interests of
minorities, backward castes, farmers, students and youth.
</P>
<P>
Terming the Indian foreign policy as faulty, they said the
country has become isolated after conducting nuclear tests last
month which invited sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Prasad Yadav said the new front will have Singh Yadav, a former
defense minister, as its convenor.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the merge of the two opposition parties, Congress
spokesman Ajit Jogi said his party welcomed the formation of the
RLM.
</P>
<P>
Congress favors consolidation of secular forces and the
formation of the new front could be seen only in this perspective,
he added.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, an official of the ruling BJP dismissed the
merge of the two parties as "non-event," saying there was no need
to react to it.

<HEADLINE> Emergent State Declared in Chechnya to Fight Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
has declared a state of emergency to fight rampant crimes cutting
into the economic and social life in the Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his move on Tuesday, Maskhadov told the Interfax
news agency on Wednesday that the security measure to designed
help the republic's economic agenda and improve public safety.
</P>
<P>
Under the state of emergency, while a curfew is imposed,
citizens are not allowed to carry weapons around without
authorization, or to hold mass rallies and stage demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government will step up border checks.
</P>
<P>
Calling it an understandable move, Russian Presidential
Representative Ivan Rybkin said a popularly elected Maskhadov was
entrusted to defend the peace and stability of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
However, under the Russian constitution, only the president of
the Russian Federation has the right to declare such an emergent
state in the country or in any of its provinces.

<HEADLINE> Africa Needs Debt Relief for Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Africa can not register any
economic growth unless international lending institutions and
donor nations relieve it of its debt burden.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Tuesday by Malawi's Minister of Agriculture
and Irrigation, Aleke Banda, in Lilongwe before his departure for
Brussels, Belgium, where he will represent the Minister of
Finance to attend an African, Carribean and Pacific (ACP) finance
ministers' conference, the Malawi News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Africa generates a lot of wealth, but due to huge debts all
that is used for servicing debts than improving their finances,
Aleke Banda said, adding "the trend can only be improved if
international lending institutions and donor countries give
Africa a debt relief."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the conference is a follow-up of the Gabon
summit which was held last year and "is aimed at formulating
strategies which could help ACP countries reduce their debt
burden."
</P>
<P>
"Malawi needs more financial assistance to boost its
agriculture, health and education sectors while at the same time,
trying every effort to reduce the country's debts," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Calls for Neutral Political Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Prince Norodom Ranariddh of
Cambodia said Wednesday a neutral political environment leading to
free, fair and credible elections is yet to be established.
</P>
<P>
As deposed first prime minister, Ranariddh said in a statement
that there are still adverse political signs in Cambodia,
including a continued atmosphere of fear, intimidation and killing.
</P>
<P>
Besides, while there is no equal access to the media, there is
bias in the National Election Committee and the Constitutional
Council, said the president of the opposition Funcinpec Party.
</P>
<P>
However, he vowed that Funcinpec will make unwavering efforts
to help bring peace and prosperity to the country, by joining in
the electoral process leading to the elections of July 26.
</P>
<P>
He urged the world community to address the opposition's
concerns and its wish to join peacefully in the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
Failure to do so, Ranariddh warned, will make it very difficult
for Funcinpec and the democratic opposition to remain engaged in
the process.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Teachers Threaten to Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's 260,000-strong teachers'
union vowed Wednesday to launch a nationwide strike over the pay
row with the government which now faces a grim test on its budget
pledges to cut down expenditures and revamp the battled economy.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) demanded the
government carry out no later than August 13 the second
instalment of a salary agreement reached between the two sides in
October after a 11-day bitter strike.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, KNUT said it will call a full-fledged strike by
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
"If there is no movement...then the teachers of Kenya on
September 14 will down their tools until the second instalment is
paid," a local report quoted KNUT Assistant Secretary General
Lawrence Majali as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot renegotiate what was agreed to last year," Majali
said. KNUT broke off talks with the government last week,
arguing that the teachers are not responsible for the country's
fiscal mess.
</P>
<P>
On June 11, Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae said in his budget
speech at the parliament that the teachers' pay hike would have
to be re-negotiated, while setting a target to sack 66,000
teachers in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The government had agreed reluctantly to boost teachers'
salaries by between 150-200 percent over five years to end an
11-day strike last October at a time when the second multi-party
general elections were to be held two months later.
</P>
<P>
Teachers have already received part of that wage increase and
were expecting the government to set out a schedule for future
payments. They now earn between 2,700 Shillings (45 US Dollars)
and 29,000 Shillings (527 US Dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Kalonzo Musyoka has said Kenya cannot
afford another major strike amid the current difficult economic
times.
</P>
<P>
"What we want to discuss with the teachers is how the pending
phases on the implementation of the salaries can be effected
without hurting the economy," Musyoka told local media earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
Cutting public spending especially on civil servants' wages
was highlighted in the budget for the fiscal year of 1998/99
(July 1/June 30).
</P>
<P>
"The combined public sector wage bill, assuming civil servants
are given similar increment, would absorb 67 percent of total
revenue," Nyachae warned in his budget speech.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in the east African country fell from 4.6
percent in 1996 to 2.3 percent last year with the budget deficit
making up 2.7 percent of the total gross domestic product.

<P>
ATHENS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos will begin Thursday a four-day state visit to
Cyprus in a bid to show Greece's support to the divided island
republic.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the first ever by a Greek head of state to
Cyprus, Stephanopoulos will have talks with his Cypriot
counterpart Glafcos Clerides and representatives of the Cypriot
political parties and address the Cyprus House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The president will also visit the Green Line, the
U.N.-controlled buffer zone between Clerides' Republic of Cyprus
in the south and the Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, which was
proclaimed in 1983 and recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive
coup-backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen its defense capacity, Cyprus has decided to
purchase the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. but with
the nearing of the deployment of the missiles, the tension in the
island has since earlier this year been escalating due to Turkey's
threat of preventing their installation.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Continues Exploring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A special committee of the
Israeli government Wednesday continued its discussion on the
possibility of holding a referendum over the second redeployment
of Israeli troops in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the committee, headed by Justice Minister
Tzachi Hanegbi, focused on what kind of media campaigning would
be permitted in the context of a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the discussion is to lay down rules that would
enable both proponents and opponents to explain their positions
to the public in radio and television broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry has also been asked to collect data
on how other countries have handled such kind of issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday
told leaders of his coalition parties that obtaining a consensus
in the public on the next redeployment is very important.
</P>
<P>
He said that the whole process for holding a referendum would
be finished within two months from the moment a decision is made
by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government is currently under pressure from the
United States to accept a peace proposal in a bid to revive the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which has been deadlocked for
more than 15 months.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan, which has been accepted formally by the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), calls on Israel to hand over
13.1 percent of the West Bank in the second redeployment, in
exchange for the Palestinian tougher actions against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, the right-wing in the Netanyahu government rejected
the proposal, saying that any withdrawal of more than 9 percent
would endanger the security of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that he is in favor of taking the pullback
issue to the public as a way to solve the dispute in his
government and find a solution to the next withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
In response, the PNA said that the idea of holding a
referendum was only another excuse used by Netanyahu to further
delay the implementation of the second redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Corel, of Canada, Fails to Boost Share in Software Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Corel Corp., a leading Canadian
software publisher, has failed to boost its sagging market share
through price discount, said a report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa-based company cut the price of its main product,
known as WordPerfect office suite, in mid-March by 50 percent,
aiming to boost sales without hurting profits.
</P>
<P>
But latest figures from market researcher PC Data Inc. show
that its market share, on the contrary, has dropped to 9 percent,
the lowest since it bought the WordPerfect software line from
Novell Inc. in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
It's far behind software giant Microsoft Corp., which gained a
90 percent market share in April.
</P>
<P>
The greater sales volume boosted by the price cutting failed to
offset the profit loss of the price cuts, said a report in
Canada's leading national newspaper Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
PC Data said the revenue from the office suite fell to 2.7
million U.S. dollars in April as against that of 3.7 million
dollars in April.
</P>
<P>
Corel's price cutting is ineffective against a rival as strong
as Microsoft, and it has yet to come up with a strategy that will
allow it to co-exist profitably with the software giant, a analyst
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Corel's price cutting did increase its share of
software units sold, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It accounted for 20 percent of office software units sold in
April, up from 15 percent in February, but still lower than its
January share of 21 percent.

<HEADLINE> President Clinton Leaves for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton left
here at noon Wednesday on a nine-day visit to China, the first by
a U.S. president in almost 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the president in his visit are First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton and their daughter Chelsea as well as Secretary of
State Madaleine Albright, Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin,
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, Secretary of Agriculture
Dan Glickman and Secretary of Commerce William Daley and some
congressmen.
</P>
<P>
The president's special plane Air Force One will get refueling
at Elmendorf before flying over the Pacific Ocean. The visit will
take the president to Xi'an, Beijing, Shanghai, Guilin and Hong
Kong before he returns home on July 3.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is scheduled to meet with his Chinese
counterpart Jiang Zemin in Beijing to follow up their Washington
summit last fall. The two leaders have agreed to make a joint
effort to establish a constructive strategic relationship between
the two countries for the next century.
</P>
<P>
The president resisted the pressure from Congress Republicans
who have urged him to postpone or cancel the controversial trip,
believing his visit serves the national interests of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Clinton's departure, Senate Democrats Tuesday
effectively shut down debate on a 271 billion U.S. dollar defense
bill as a way of blocking votes on China policy.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats led by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle turned
what had been intended as a test procedural vote on a package of
China amendments into an ambiguous 82-14 tally.

"I am not going to allow one single vote on China this week,"
Daschle said. "We're not going to embarrass this president."
</P>
<P>
"It isn't just horrendous, it's dangerous, it's damaging. It
diminishes the ability of the president to go with the sense that
he's got a clear playing field," said Senator John Kerry.
</P>
<P>
Ten Senators -- five Democrats and five Republicans -- wrote a
"Dear Colleague" letter saying that the adoption of the amendments
would "halt a decade of U.S. efforts to encourage greater Chinese
adherence to international norms in such areas of
nonproliferation, human rights and trade."
</P>
<P>
The anti-China package would deny travel to the United States
by Chinese officials who engage in alleged religious persecution
or forced abortion and sterilization policies, and oppose further
World Bank loans to China. These restrictions have already been
passed by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Senior lawmakers of both parties were believed to be seeking to
avoid a prolonged confrontation on China while Clinton is visiting
that Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Non-proliferation, human rights and trade are high on President
Clinton's agenda in Beijing. He is expected to reaffirm the U.S.
"One China Policy" toward Taiwan embodied in the three China-U.S.
Joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the visit will further push ahead the
bilateral relationship, which has improved remarkably since
President Jiang Zemin visited the United States about eight months
ago.
</P>
<P>
Both sides admitted that differences concerning such issues
like Taiwan, Tibet, human rights and trade imbalance still exist.
However, they prefer to settle them through open dialogues rather
than confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agree that it is more important to cooperate
with each other in the wake of financial crisis in East Asia and
tension buildup in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
They share the view that promoting peace and stability in Asia
and the Pacific region serves the interests of both countries and
is helpful to world peace and prosperity.

<HEADLINE> NATO "Refining" Military Options on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO ambassadors here are still
studying and assessing military options to resolve the crisis in
Serbia's southern province of Kosovo on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move came as NATO chief Javier Solana urged visiting
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova to resume immediate
and unconditional talks with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The group was "refining" its options at the stage, said a NATO
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Focus was on air strikes, said the official, but plans of
preventive deployment of NATO ground troops in Albania and
Macedonia were not ruled out.
</P>
<P>
NATO defense ministers agreed last week on resorting to air
strikes to force Yugoslavia to stop alleged "indiscriminate use of
force against civilian population" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people, many of whom being women, children and
the elderly, have reportedly died in clashes raging in Kosovo
since February between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians who
outnumber Serbs nine to one in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
As for Moscow, who opposes military means on Kosovo, the same
official said Russia's military contact in Brussels was kept
informed of the NATO assessment so that there will be no surprise
for Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia has complained that it was not informed of the NATO air
exercises in Albania and Macedonia after the 16-number Western
military alliance decided to conduct airborne exercises in the two
Balkan countries, both bordering the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russia even recalled its permanent military representative to
the NATO headquarters for the incident and continued to call for
peaceful means to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
On Belgrade, the NATO official said Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic was held with the major responsibility to withdraw
security forces from Kosovo and to allow international monitoring
inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav army should return to their barracks in either
Yugoslavia or inside Kosovo, the official said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's show of force last week with 85 aircraft flying over
Albanian and Macedonian borders with Yugoslavia failed to
discourage Yugoslavia, which has between 45,000 and 50,000 troops
in Kosovo, to withdraw its armed force from the province where
ethnic Albanians seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
About the break-away Kosovar Liberation Army, the NATO official
said the alliance's political strategy is to control, contain and
reduce the influence of independence fighters in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The bloc has urged Yugoslavia to grant ethnic Albanians
meaningful autonomy stripped since early 1990s, but stopped short
of independence.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Issue Unified Driving License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) will issue a unified driving license so that
citizens of its member countries can drive freely in the region.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Minister of Transport and Communications Andre Brandao
made the disclosure here Wednesday to the press. He said the
draft has been approved by member states and will be adopted
Friday at the annual meeting of the SADC Committee of Transport
Ministers in Mbabane, capital of Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
The launching of unified driving license in the region is
aimed to unify the sizes and types of the licenses for the
convenience of the police as well as the free movement of people
and goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the Mbabane meeting will also
discuss the issue of unifications of the civil aviation
communications systems in the region in a bid to enforce safety.
</P>
<P>
Brandao left here Wednesday for the meeting in Swaziland.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Epidemic Shows Deaths Down in Richer Countries, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- AIDS is declining in richer
countries and going up in poorer ones, according to the first-ever
country-by-country study of the epidemic, which was released here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study pointed to a "preventive gap:" while most
industrialized nations and a handful of developing countries are
seeing the spread of HIV level off or even decline, infection
rates are reaching alarming new highs in most of the developing
world.
</P>
<P>
The Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic, produced by the
Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, blamed the gap on uneven
access to drugs that combat HIV and forestall the development of
AIDS-related infections and cancers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, an estimated of 30.6 million people
worldwide were living with HIV, including over 1 million children,
according to United Nations estimates.
</P>
<P>
Africa has the highest prevalence of HIV, with some 21 million
infected people. In Botswana and Zimbabwe, one out of every four
adult has HIV.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Uganda are the only developing countries in the
world where HIV rates are declining, thanks to prevention
programs, according to the study. Other developing countries have
the potential to achieve similar success through sustained and
focused prevention efforts.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here Wednesday that he stands ready to cooperate with
the Cambodian authorities to move the electoral process forward in
that country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief reiterated his call to the Cambodian government
to "do its utmost to create an environment conducive to the
holding of free, fair and credible elections," according to a
statement by his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Annan is pleased with the large turnout by the Cambodian people
to register for the elections and commends the National Election
Committee (NEC) for their efforts, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
He urgently appealed to donor countries to close a NEC funding
gap of 3 million U.S. dollars as soon as possible since elections
are only a month away, due on July 26.
</P>
<P>
Despite considerable progress in the preparations for the
elections, a series of concerns remain to be addressed on issues
such as voter intimidation and equitable access by all parties to
the electronic media, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
It said Annan will make a further review in early July of
developments on the elections and the U.N. role in coordinating
international observers.

<HEADLINE> Incremental Reform Contributes to Turkmenistan's Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The incremental reform strategy
adopted in Turkmenistan has fended off potential economic meltdown
and social unrest, said President Saparmurad Atayevich Niyazov.
</P>
<P>
In an article published in the Russian newspaper Independence,
Niyazov said incremental reform has maintained the basic living
standard of low-income families and subsequently social stability.
</P>
<P>
The strategy has been proved to be the right one tailored to
the country's reality, said Niyazov, adding that it has laid a
solid foundation for furthering the country's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),
Niyazov said he was against the establishment of any group within
the CIS framework but with authorization beyond its member states.
</P>
<P>
The CIS should not be a memento to the Soviet era, and it could
achieve future growth only if it works as a coordination mechanism
acceptable to all of its member states, said Niyazov.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Russia is a big power with great potentials and his
country has close economic ties with Russia, he said Turkmenistan
has given a special status to the bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Changes Position on Syrian, Lebanese Track: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 24 (Xinhua) -- European Union Special Envoy to
the Middle East Miguel Angel Moratinos said Wednesday that he
found the United States has changed its position toward the
Syrian and Lebanese track in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"After contacting with the U.S. Mideast officials, I found
that the U.S. has realized that Syrian and Lebanese negotiations
with Israel should be put on top of the agenda," Moratinos said at
a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. believed before that Syrian and Lebanese
track should start after the reviving of Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we (EU and the U.S.) all hope that the stalled Syrian
and Lebanese track reopens as soon as possible," Moratinos said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's negotiations with Syria and Lebanon were broken off
after Israeli hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu came to
power in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu did not accept what had been agreed orally by the
former Labor government to hand back the Golan Heights to Syria and
demanded the negotiations start from the scratch.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon have said that their talks with Israel must
reopen from where they were left off and be held simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
In April, Israel adopted the 20-year-old U.N. Resolution 425,
which calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon, but conditioned the pullout on Lebanese government's
security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria rejected the offer, saying it is a
"manoeuvre" aimed at driving a wedge between the two
countries. They asked Israel to leave Lebanon without any
preconditions. Syria has deployed 40,000 troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said he has discussed his new ideas with Lebanese
Foreign minister Fares Boueiz in a bid to move the peace talks
forward. But he declined to make them public.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy, who arrived here Tuesday night after a tour of
Syria and Israel, will hold talks with Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Romania Concerned as Tension Mounts in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Romania is worried about the
escalation of the conflict in Kosovo and the loss of human lives
in the region, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anda Filip told a
regular press briefing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Romania backs the international efforts to solve the conflict
and believes that an optimum solution is a political one -- by
means of negotiations between the Serbian authorities and the
representatives of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the spokeswoman
added.
</P>
<P>
"The territorial integrity of Yugoslavia must be observed, with
the sides (seeking a) solution based on a special statute of the
Kosovo region," stressed Anda Filip.
</P>
<P>
By accepting the good offices or the mediation of a European
Union official and of an acting president of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, a long-shot vie solution could
be found, said the spokeswoman. She added that Romania is also in
solidarity with NATO's efforts and will give support to the
Alliance in this sense.
</P>
<P>
Romania is analyzing the options stated by the Alliance in
reference to the solving of the Kosovo conflict, she said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu
said earlier in the month that Romania would be faithful to its
commitments, and would take action in line with that of NATO as
regards Yugoslavia.

ULAN BATOR, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia has received an
equivalent of more than 200 million U.S. dollars in foreign direct
investment from 1990 through June 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The foreign capital, said Foreign Investment Bureau chief
Jargalsaikhan at an international investment consultative meeting

China has been the leading investor in this inland Asian nation
with a total capital inflow of 55.4 million dollars, followed by
Japan, Russia, the United States and South Korea, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the focus of foreign investment has shifted from the
trade, tourism and service sectors in the early 1990s to the
mining, real estate and infrastructure sectors right now.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official said, Mongolia is trying to attract
more foreign capital into the nation, by planning the adoption of
some investment protection measures and incentive policies.

<HEADLINE> Russia Welcomes Clinton's Veto of Anti-Iran Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
Wednesday welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's veto of a bill
that imposes sanctions on companies suspected of helping Iran's
missile development program.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the ministry said Clinton's move "meets
the spirit of Russian-American relations and the agreement reached
between the presidents of Russia and the United States at their
meeting in Birmingham in May."
</P>
<P>
"The Russian leadership is pursuing a firm policy aimed at
preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
their means of delivery, including supply of any illegal rocket
technologies to Iran," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton vetoed the legislation Tuesday, saying it would damage
U.S. national interests.
</P>
<P>
"This bill would hinder, not help, our overall national
interests... making it harder to achieve the goals it is intended
to serve," Clinton said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
The veto of the Iran Missile Proliferation Act came at a time
when Clinton expressed hope last week for a "genuine
reconciliation with Iran" if it complies with the so-called
standards Washington set up as conditions for normalization of
relations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was particularly concerned about the bill's
impact on the U.S. effort to work with Russia to stem the flow of
technology from Russia to Iran's missile program.
</P>
<P>
He said the legislation failed to take into account the
progress that the administration had made in persuading Russia not
to sell missile technology to Iran.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Hails Greek President's Upcoming Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Wednesday hailed the
upcoming visit by Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos to Cyprus
as a "historic event."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said the visit is "an extremely important
event and its obvious symbolism makes this a historic event."
</P>
<P>
The Greek president is scheduled to arrive here Thursday for a
four-day visit, the first of its kind since the founding of the
Republic of Cyprus in 1960.
</P>
<P>
"The government calls upon the Cypriot people to display their
gratitude to and brotherly solidarity with the Greek people,"
Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Athens News Agency on Monday, Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides said that Greek president's visit to
Cyprus underlines the close relations between the two countries
and excellent cooperation between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
His visit comes in a very critical moment when "we need greater
possible support and Greece is our most loyal supporter," Clerides
said.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of Greece's significant support for Cyprus'
efforts to win the membership of the European Union and its
defense aid to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a joint defense pact in November 1993,
under which Greece will provide military assistance to Cyprus in
case the eastern Mediterranean island is attacked.
</P>
<P>
The Greek president's visit comes amid tension on the island
where a tit-for-tat show of force between Greece and Turkey took
place last week.
</P>
<P>
Six Greek warplanes landed earlier last week at the
newly-completed Paphos military air base on the west coast of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey sent six F-16 fighters Thursday to the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern Cyprus in retaliation, and five
Turkish warships visited the ports of Kyrenia and Famagusta there.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over, among other things, the
strategic eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed pro-Athens coup by the Greek Cypriots.

ISLAMABAD, June 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan's special envoy will arrive in Pakistan on Sunday to deliver
his message to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and prepare for his
trip to the country.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy, Alvaro de Soto, who is the U.N. assistant
secretary general for political affairs, is likely to discuss with
Sharif the role of the United Nations in reducing tension between
Pakistan and India, the News Network International (NNI) quoted
U.N. sources as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Sharif two weeks ago, the NNI
said, Annan expressed the desire to send his special envoy to
Pakistan and India in a move to help resolve disputes between the
two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Annan also said the envoy would make arrangements for his visit
to the region.
</P>
<P>
The NNI said Sharif welcomed the secretary general's move while
India refused to receive the envoy as it opposes any outside
mediation.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has called for international mediation on the Kashmir
issue but India rejects any possibility, saying the dispute should
be settled bilaterally by the two countries.

<HEADLINE> CE Officers Well-Equipped for Duties at Airport: Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Well-equipped Customs and
Exercise (CE) Department officers will carry out their duties well
at the new Hong Kong International Airport, Chief Superintendent
Wong Sau Pui of the department said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The relocation of Hong Kong's international airport marks a
new era for Hong Kong's development in air traffic industry. There
are substantial changes and improvements in areas such as
structural design, working environment, operating hours,
management and the quality of services, all render to establishing
an airport of a world class," Wong said.
</P>
<P>
The customs and exercise operation at the new airport beginning
on July 6 this year will feature such improvements as an expansion
of CE manpower, from 500 to more than 1,000, for an increased area
to be guarded and patrolled; a computer-aided, round-the-clock Air
Cargo Clearance System; and such new equipment and devices as four
sets of Canadian-made Ion Scan Sniffer Machines for detecting
dangerous drugs, a special toilet system which helps detect
internal concealment of drugs and revised models of X-ray machines
and metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
And to detect potential drug traffickers, a kind of "risk
management" would be adopted in processing incoming passengers and
cargo, he said.
</P>
<P>
Quality service would be of one of the elements of key
importance. To further improve in this area, all the CE staff
have undergone a comprehensive familiarization and training
program and practice of selecting "Best Counter Awards" will be
kept, a training program named "Customer Service Workshop" has
been conducted and a promotion exercise to promote quality
services will be launched.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that we will offer best quality services,"
Wong said.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Urges Complete Israeli Withdrawal From Arab Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel should completely
withdraw from the occupied Arab territories, the Foreign Ministry
of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea (DPRK) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, through its spokesman, told the Korean Central
News Agency (KCNA) that Israeli withdrawal is the precondition for
resolving the Mideast issue in a fair and comprehensive way.
</P>
<P>
Israel's June 21 decision to extend the municipal boundaries of
Jerusalem is "a challenge to and mockery of unbiased opinion of
the Arab and world communities," the ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The recent move on the part of the Israeli government fully
reveals its intention to impede the Mideast peace process and keep
hold on Jerusalem and the West Bank, it said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations resolutions on the Middle East issue have
urged Israel to withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories,
including east Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Golan Heights, it
noted.
</P>
<P>
However, it added, the "double standards" in the implementation
of U.N. resolutions have fanned up Israel's ambition for
territorial expansion.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming that the DPRK's position concerning Mideast peace
remains unchanged, the Foreign Ministry called on the world
community to keep pressure on Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President-Elect Joseph
Estrada said here Thursday that he would leave the burial of
former President Ferdinand Marcos to be decided by the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
Estrada made the remarks after a senator and some groups
threatened to file a petition with the Supreme Court against
Estrada's plan to bury Marcos at the heroes' cemetery in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The president in waiting stood firm on his decision, saying
that only the Supreme Court could stop him from burying Marcos at
the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
He added that there are no laws in the country preventing the
burial of Marcos, who fought against the Japanese invaders during
the Second World War, at the cemetery which is usually for war
heroes and presidents.
</P>
<P>
Early on the same day, former First Lady Imelda Marcos
announced that the burial of her husband at the heroes' cemetery
will be postponed indefinitely, giving a relief to Estrada who was
facing mounting protests.
</P>
<P>
"In the spirit of national interest, our family is prepared to
wait... the burial of the late President Marcos will be deferred
to a more appropriate time," Imelda said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Imelda also expressed thanks to Estrada "for his compassion and
kindness" in announcing his intent to give Marcos an honorable
burial.
</P>
<P>
Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in 1986. He went into
exile in Hawaii, the United States, in the same year and died
there three years later. His remains were returned to the
Philippines in 1993.

The minister stressed both the necessity and importance for
providing special training for grass roots officials, especially
those elected to villages and township governments, in order to
enhance their legal awareness and sense of democracy.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry is currently training officials in charge of
village elections throughout the nation in areas such as relevant
laws and necessary measures for ensuring the democratic nature of
elections," according to Cering.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Chinese authorities have always attached
great importance to developing democracy in rural regions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Central Committee of the Communist

all villages to introduce a system for "open and democratic
management of village affairs".

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress,
China's legislature, is currently deliberating an amendment to the
Organic Law on Village Committees, a fundamental document
governing the country's rural democracy.
</P>

"I'm convinced that it won't take long for grass roots
officials to significantly improve their democratic and legal
awareness, and farmer across the nation to realize their

<HEADLINE> HKETO in Singapore to Mark Anniversary of HK Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 25, (Xinhua) -- A number of activities will be
organized in Singapore to mark the first anniversary of Hong
Kong's handover to China, a senior representative of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Tso, director of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office
(HKETO) in Singapore, told reporters that his office has finalized
the schedule for the celebrations in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that "through these activities, we hope to assure
people all over the world that despite the difficult times that
are confronting us, Hong Kong is still sound and well."
</P>
<P>
"With the sound economic fundamentals, Hong Kong people are
bullish about their future," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said his office will hold a cocktail reception at the
Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Center (SICEC)
on the same day for 1,000 guests.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that this year's Miss Hong Kong, Miss Heung
Hoi-lan, who is also Miss Hospitality, will come to attend the
reception to help promote Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tso noted that Hong Kong's reunification with China has been
"smooth and successful."
</P>
<P>
"So much so that apart from the obvious visible changes, such
as the new flag and the new emblem, the majority people would not
have noticed any change at all," after China restored the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has had a very successful transition," he said. "For
the first time in history, Hong Kong people are running Hong Kong
by themselves with a high degree of autonomy."
</P>
<P>
As part of the celebrations, according to the director, a Mini
Hong Kong Fair will also be held at the lobby of the SICEC from
July 2 to 5 to feature the lifestyle in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At the fair, he said, singers and acrobats from Hong Kong will
stage performances and renowned chefs will demonstrate their
culinary skills in preparing Cantonese cuisine.
</P>
<P>
He also said an exhibition on the new Hong Kong International
Airport, scheduled to open for commercial operation on July 6,
will be mounted at the same time to show its key state-of-the-art
features.
</P>
<P>
The new airport in Chek Lap Kok will be able to handle 35
million passengers and 3 million tons of air cargo every year in
its initial stages.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Election System for Village Committees to Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to practice
the democratic election system for village committees currently
in place in the country's vast rural areas, according to Minister
of Civil Affairs Doje Cering.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks during today's press conference
and explained that the democratic system not only
reflects the spirit of democracy, but also conforms to reality in
China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "ten years of experience fully proves the success
of the democratic election system, although certain imbalances
in different regions have cropped up in implementing the system
due to various factors ranging from history and geography to
economy and culture."
</P>
<P>
The minister referred to the candidacy of rural entrepreneurs
by noting that farmers need someone capable of leading them to
prosperity and the election of entrepreneurs is full
justified so long as said individuals refrain from illegal
activities during the election process.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that China's democratic election system is
still far from perfect and pointed to certain cases in which rural
entrepreneurs have resorted to illegal devices to win voter
support. He stressed that election results in such cases should be
invalidated and the candidates involved to subject to severe
punishment.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that China's democratic election system has
matured over the past 10 years, and stressed that continuous
implementation of the system will be highly beneficial to
protecting the rights and interests of China's 900 million
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah, Israel Exchange Corpses of Dead Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Hezbollah (Party of God)
and Israel Thursday exchanged their fighters' corpses held by each
other under the auspices of the International Committee for the
Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
A French military plane took the mutilated remains of Israeli
sergeant Itamar Ilya from the Beirut International Airpor to
Tel Aviv via Cyprus and will return an hour later with 40 bodies
of Lebanese guerrillas killed in attacks in the Israeli occupied
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Ilya was one of the 12 Israeli soldiers killed in a bungled
commando raid in a southern Lebanese village of Insariyeh last
September.
</P>
<P>
His remains which Israeli helicopter failed to pick up from
the battle field were jointly held by Hezbollah and Lebanon's
another anti-Israeli Muslim group Amal led by House Speaker
Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
The part of Ilya's scalp Amal is holding is not included in the
exchange as the group disagreed with Israel over the number and
names of Lebanese prisoners to be released from Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Lebanese guerrillas included 28 from Hezbollah,
nine from Amal and three from Lebanese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah sources said the exchange operation came after nine
months of tortuous negotiations between the two parties and
credited the success of the exchange to the great efforts the
ICRC has played in coordination with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
They described the swap, the second between Hezbollah and
Israel in two years, as a "great victory" for the country's
resistance movement, Lebanese people and the nation's unity.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
settlements from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's anti-occupation movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has never stopped military resistance against Israel's
2,000 troops in south Lebanon and incurred heavy losses on them.
</P>
<P>
The swap for the return of Ilya's remains will also include the
release of 60 Lebanese prisoners, 10 from Israeli jails and 50
from notorious Khiam prison in south Lebanon run by Israeli allied
militia South Lebanese Army.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to be freed and sent home by the ICRC through
the Kfar Falous crossing that links the enclave to the rest of
Lebanon on Friday.

ISLAMABAD, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan hopes that the current
visit to China by U.S. President Bill Clinton will bring forth
positive results for the improvement of peace and security
situation in South Asia, a Foreign Office spokesman said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Terming Clinton's visit as an important event for the region,
Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf told Xinhua that Pakistan,
which has friendly relations with both countries, hopes that "the
visit will bring forth positive results for both of them as well
as for the entire region."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan believes that the international community,
particularly the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, should engage themselves in a political process which
helps in the resolution of the problems and tensions in South
Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that President Clinton's visit to Beijing offers a
very good opportunity for reaffirmation of their desire to bring
about peace in South Asia through a just settlement of the core
issue of Kashmir," he said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that "in their communique issued at Geneva on June
4, the foreign ministers of the five Security Council permanent
members had affirmed their readiness to assist India and Pakistan
to resolve their disputes."

BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Civil Affairs Doje
Cering pledged today that the Chinese government will do
everything possible to protect the democratic rights of rural
voters to elect villagers' committees.
</P>
<P>
Cering made the remarks at a press conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that certain difficulties in organizing elections
have emerged as a result of the exodus of over 100 million surplus
rural workers to urban areas.
</P>
<P>
However, the growing awareness of their democratic rights has
prompted many voters to either return home to vote or otherwise
cast their ballots by mail.
</P>
<P>
Some people unable to personally cast their votes have in some
cases entrusted others to do so, said Cering, adding that the
procedure is carried out under supervision.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the procedure represents an example of protecting
the rights of illiterate voters. Ballots in some parts of east
China's Fujian Province include both the names and photographs of
candidates in order to enable illiterate voters to easily make
their selections.

XI'AN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton opened
his nine-day visit to China by saying that he is for "closer ties
and deeper friendship between America and China".
</P>
<P>
"There may be those here and back in America who wonder whether
closer ties and deeper friendship between America and China are
good. Clearly, the answer is yes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said this in his first speech in China before thousands
of local people who, led by local leading officials, were offering
the US president and his official delegation a "magnificant
welcome" as described by Clinton himself.
</P>
<P>
"We have powerful ability to help each other grow. We can learn

"As two great nations, we have a special responsibility to the
future of the world. The steps we take over the next week can lead
to far greater strides for our people in the years ahead," he added.
</P>
<P>
"As I travel across China, I hope to learn as much as I can
about the Chinese people, your history and your dreams for the
future; and I hope to help the Chinese people understand more of
America's history, the lessons the Amercian people have drawn from
it, and the dreams we hold for the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe both Chinese and Americans aspire to many of the
same things -- to provide for our families, to teach our children,
to build our communities, to protect our Earth, to shape our own
futures, and pass brighter possibilities on to our children," he
added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> PNA Criticizes Israel's Settlement Expansion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Thursday criticized Israel for "new aggression"
against the Palestinians by adopting an expansion plan for a
settlement, the Voice of Palestine (VOP) radio reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is a new aggression (of Israel) against the Palestinian
people and land" by planning to expand the Kiryat Arba settlement
near the West Bank city of Hebron, PNA Cabinet Secretary Ahmed
Abdel Rahman said in Ramallah, West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Housing Ministry said in the day that it has
endorsed the expansion plan, under which 140 housing units will be
built around the Kiryat Arba settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Cabinet Sunday approved a plan to set up an
"umbrella authority" for Jerusalem over eight West Bank Jewish
settlements to the east, north and south of the city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have criticized the Israeli government for
putting hurdles in the peace process by changing the status of the
holy city.
</P>
<P>
"We say this government (of Israel) is an anti-peace
government. It is a government of settlers which demolish
Palestinian houses and construct housing units for settlers on
our lands," Rahman told the VOP.
</P>
<P>
He urged the United Nations Security Council to take urgent
measures to pressure Israel to stop such activities. He called on
the Arab states to convene an Arab summit to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Agreements signed between the Palestinians and Israel demand
that the Jewish state halt settlement activities and that neither
side take unilateral actions over Jerusalem, whose issues will be
negotiated in the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent state.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Permanent Delegates Hold Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Council
Thursday held an emergency meeting at the level of permanent
delegates to discuss Israel's plan on expanding Jerusalem's
boundaries, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting held at Palestine's request and under the
chairmanship of Ahmed Abdel Halim, Sudan's delegate to the league,
tackled measures and steps to be adopted by the Arab countries to
break the current dangerous deadlock in the Mideast peace process
because of Israel's intransigent policy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by AL Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid, comes within the context of Arab support for the
Palestinian stance and ongoing efforts on the regional and
international arenas to protect Jerusalem against Israeli schemes,
the league's diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
Palestine's delegate to the AL Mohamed Sobeih submitted
preliminary information on Israel's plan to the league chief
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The league council is expected to issue during the meeting a
statement calling upon the U.N. Security Council to hold a special
session to probe Israel's repeated violations of Jerusalem status,
the sources added.
</P>
<P>
It is to assign Abdul-Meguid to make contacts with the Security
Council's permanent and non-permanent member states and the
Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) in a bid to come up with a
unified stance in face of Israeli policies, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid is also expected to contact regional
organizations and the chairman of the OIC's Jerusalem Committee to
mobilize efforts to isolate Israel's extremist policy and expose
its practices, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Cabinet approved Sunday a controversial plan on
extending the Jerusalem municipal authority over eight Jewish
settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed
it in a move that has failed to win international recognition. The
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future
independent state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been deadlocked for 15
months over Israel's settlement building in East Jerusalem and
long-delayed withdrawal from the West Bank. Israel has rejected a
U.S. initiative on further redeployment, which has been accepted
by the Palestinians.

</P>
<P>
The democratic process in China's rural areas was introduced in
1988 when a new law required the local direct elections for all
village officials who were formerly appointed by governments at
higher levels.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the nation's over one million villages
have held three direct elections for village committees and many
farmers have acquired the right to participate in and supervise
local management.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister conceded that officials in some areas
lacked democratic and legal awareness and often failed to follow
prescribed democratic procedures of village elections.
</P>
<P>
Their failure has led to an imbalance in the development of
rural democracy across China, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
"China has a long feudal history of several thousand years, and
various officials at the grass roots level are accustomed to
simply issuing administrative orders," said Cering. "They will
need some time to understand and familiarize themselves with
democracy a the rule of law."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Lifts Ban on Indonesian Timber Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia announced Thursday
that it has lifted a ban on the import of timber products from
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"We made this decision (to lift the ban) because Indonesia's
timber products are now very cheaply priced in the international
market," Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said
while making the announcement at a press conference here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia banned the import of logs, sawn timber and plywood
from Indonesia in January last year to help the Indonesians
prevent excessive smuggling out of their timber products due to
high export taxes.
</P>
<P>
But the situation has now changed when Indonesia, having
decided to boost its export sector, slashed its export taxes on
logs and sawn timber to 30 percent of the free-on-board prices in
April this year, consequently making Indonesian timber products
cheaper in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia also said the export tax would be further reduced to
20 percent by December this year, to 15 percent by December 1999
to 10 percent by December 2000.
</P>
<P>
Lim said the availability of cheaper Indonesian timber would
also aid Malaysia's sustainable forest management programs.
</P>
<P>
He said that following the lifting of the ban, those who want
to import logs from Indonesia tax-free would have to start
applying for permits and his ministry and the Malaysian Timber
Industrial Board (MTIB) would be facilitating the process (of
getting the permits).

CHANGSHA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A major landslide recently in
Ningxiang County in central China's Hunan Province destroyed about
20 hectares of farmland. No casualties have ever been reported.
</P>

The landslide was caused by the continued heavy rainfall in the
region, which also washed away a section of highway and a bridge,
causing estimated property damage of 3 million yuan (about

<HEADLINE> Half Of Tibet's Visitors Come From Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 540,000 foreigners have
visited Tibet since 1980, accounting for nearly a half of the
tourists during that time, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Region's Tourism Bureau says the number of
foreigners to Tibet last year was 82,000 and is expected to
climb. Most come from Europe, North America, Japan, Southeast Asia
and Oceania, and a few from South Asia, Africa, and South America.
</P>
<P>
One study has shown that foreign tourists are interested in the
scenery, religious culture, and folk customs and can be divided
into two groups, one being elderly people who already have a lot
of information about the region, and the other, young people who
view the visit as an adventure.
</P>
<P>
A few travel on foot or by bike. Many are photographers,
scientists, Tibetologists, and naturalists.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, most foreigners have very little knowledge
about Tibet. Some are even afraid that Tibet doesn't have hotels,
food, and drink for tourists," says Tang Zhengqi, director of the
Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 57 million overseas people visited China.
</P>
<P>
To attract more visitors, the regional government has opened
offices in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu to issue
entrance permits and organize group visits and for promotion
campaigns, Tang says.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet is seeing political stability and a developed economy,
and people are living a happy life, all these indicate a good
opportunity for tourists," Tang concludes.

<HEADLINE> China Promotes Democracy to Battle Rural Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- China will actively promote
democracy to eradicate corruption in rural areas, according to
Minister of Civil Affairs Doje Cering.
</P>
<P>
"The majority, if not all, of corruption issues will be solved
by establishing grass roots democracy in rural areas," he told
a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
Some one million villages throughout the nation have completed
three rounds of democratic elections for village committees. The
Organic Law on Village Committees was adopted in 1987 granting
farmers the right participate in democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that the democratic election system
grants farmers power to control personnel affairs and makes it
impossible for corrupt individuals to serve on village committees.
</P>
<P>
The law not only grants Chinese villagers the right to elect
local officials, but also the right to supervise their work.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party and State Council jointly issued a circular
stipulating that villagers nationwide have the right to
participate in the decision-making process on major issues, and
requiring village officials to periodically disclose the financial
affairs of village and status of all major local affairs.
</P>
<P>
Cering pointed out that corruption in villages is far from the
mainstream and stressed that villagers trust the vast majority of
local officials.
</P>
<P>
"Trust has has been manifest by the fact that many village
officials have remained at their posts successive terms of
office," according to Cering.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: China's Principle, Stand on Taiwan Issue and US Commitment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan issue, which has long
been the most important and sensitive issue in Sino-U.S.
relations, will inevitably be a main topic during U.S. President
Bill Clinton's visit to China starting today.
</P>
<P>
If there are still troubles on the issue, it will be hard for
Sino-U.S bilateral ties to move ahead, but even to retrogress.
</P>
<P>
China's basic principle on solution to the Taiwan issue is
"peaceful reunification, and one country, two systems" set forth
by late Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
On January 30, 1995, President Jiang Zemin made an important
speech titled "Continue to Promote the Reunification of the
Motherland", raising eight-point proposal on the development of
ties between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits and the peaceful
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The eight-point proposition included:
</P>
<P>
-- Adherence to the principle of one China is the basis and
premise for peaceful reunification;
</P>
<P>
-- The central government does not challenge the development of
non-governmental economic and cultural ties by Taiwan with foreign
countries. However, it opposes Taiwan's activities in "expanding
its living space internationally";
</P>
<P>
-- Holding of negotiations between the two sides on peaceful
reunification of the motherland;
</P>
<P>
-- Striving for the peaceful reunification of the motherland
since the Chinese should not fight fellow Chinese;
</P>
<P>
-- Making great efforts to expand economic exchanges and
cooperation between the two sides of the Straits;
</P>
<P>
-- Compatriots on both sides of the Straits inherit and carry
forward the fine traditions of the Chinese culture;
</P>
<P>
-- The life style of Taiwan compatriots and their aspiration to
be the masters of their own destiny be fully respected and all
their legitimate rights and interests be protected; and
</P>
<P>
-- Leaders of the Taiwan authorities welcome to pay visits in
appropriate capacities; while Chinese mainland officials ready to
accept invitations from the Taiwan side to visit the island.
</P>
<P>
China has always stressed that adherence to the principles of
the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, signed in 1972, 1978 and
1982 respectively, a re the key to sound and stable development
of Sino-U.S. ties.

legitimate government of China;
</P>
<P>
-- Taiwan is a province of China which has long been returned
to the motherland;
</P>
<P>
-- The liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affairs with
which no other country has the right to interfere;
</P>
<P>
-- And all US forces and military installations must be
withdrawn from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government resolutely opposes any attempts to
create "one China, one Taiwan", "one China, two governments", "two
Chinas", "Taiwan independence" or to advocate that "the status of
Taiwan remains to be determined".
</P>
<P>
The U.S. declared that "the United States acknowledges that all
Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Straits maintain that there
is but one China and Taiwan is a part of China. The U.S.
government did not challenge this stand, and reaffirmed the
ultimate objective of the withdrawal of all U.S. forces and
military installations from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic
Relations between China and the U.S. signed on December 16, 1978,
the United States recognized "the Government of the People's
Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China. Within
this context, the people of the United States will maintain
cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with the
people of Taiwan" and "there is but one China and Taiwan is part
of China."
</P>
<P>
On August 17, 1982, the two countries signed a third joint
communique as a solution to the issue of American arms sale to
Taiwan, in which the U.S. side declared that it did not seek to
carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, and promised
"that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in
qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied
in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations
between the United States and China, and that it intends gradually
to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of
time, to a final resolution."

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: China's Principle, Stand on Taiwan Issue and U.S. Commitment (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Based on the three communiques, Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and U.S. President Clinton signed a joint statement in Washington
during Jiang's visit to the United States in October last year.
</P>
<P>
In the joint statement, the Chinese side underlined that the
Taiwan question is the most important and sensitive crucial issue
in Sino-U.S. relations and the proper handling of this issue in
strict compliance with the principles set forth in the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques hold the key to sound and stable
growth of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side reiterated it will adhere to its "one China"
policy and observe the principles set forth in the three joint
communiques.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has vowed publicly that it does not support
the stand of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", independence
of Taiwan, or Taiwan's participation in the United Nations or
other international organizations composed of sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
China's principles on tackling issues concerning Taiwan in
international affairs mainly include:
</P>
<P>
-- As part of China, Taiwan neither can nor is qualified to
become a member of international organizations which only
sovereign states can participate in;
</P>
<P>
-- the question of China's representation in the UN has been
resolved in a fair and thorough manner, and there does not exist
the question of the Taiwan authorities' representation in the UN
or that of Taiwan's re-entry.
</P>
<P>
-- Taiwan, as a Chinese region, can participate in regional
economic organizations in the name of Chinese Taipei, which is a
special arrangement and does not form a model for activities in
other intergovernmental international organizations and
international activities.
</P>
<P>
-- Countries with diplomatic relations with China should not
set up relations of an official nature with Taiwan, nor set up
bodies of an official nature for exchanges of an official nature
under any pretext.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government always holds that the Taiwan question is
China's internal affair, an issue concerning China's efforts to
maintain territorial integrity, which hooks no external
interference.

<TEXT>
<P>
Back in 1979, the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) issued an appeal to Taiwan compatriots that
declared the major guiding principles and policies of the Chinese
government on the peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue, called
for negotiations by both sides of the Straits on ending a state of
military hostilities, and promised that the mainland "will
respect the current situations in Taiwan and adopt reasonable
and rational policies and measures."
</P>
<P>
Two and a half years later, Ye Jianying, then NPC Standing
Committee chairman, said that "Taiwan can be a special
administrative region enjoying a high degree of autonomy after
national reunification", and suggested that the Communist Party
and the Kuomintang in power on both sides of the Straits hold
talks on the basis of reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has repeatedly declared that it's ready
to resolve the issue of Taiwan's reunification with the mainland
in a peaceful way, but never committed itself to the non-use of
force. A serious crisis in Sino-U.S. relations caused by the
Taiwan issue does not accord with the present and long-term
interests of the U.S.. To maintain the favorable momentum in the
development of bilateral ties, the U.S. side must face squarely
China's stance on the Taiwan issue so as to avoid serious
conflicts with China on the issue.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea: Government Fund to Relieve Economic Hardship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government in the
second half of the year will inject an additional 5 trillion won
(3.7 billion U.S. dollars) to help relieve economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
Eligible for the fund, said Finance and Economy Minister Lee
Kyu-sung on Thursday, are local businesses now under the pressure
of liquidity and unemployment due to the economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The new credit supply, from savings of government expenditures
or proceeds of public funds, would prevent more collapses in the
country's domestic industry amid serious cash scarcity, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The government has already provided 7.9 trillion won (5.8
billion dollars) for the unemployed, while raising 50 trillion won
(37 billion dollars) for restructuring the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Of the 50 trillion won (37 billion dollars) fund, 16 trillion
(11.8 billion dollars) will be used to buy bad loans, another 16
trillion (11.8 billion dollars) to recapitalize banks, and nine
trillion (6.7 billion dollars) for deposit protection.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the world's 11th largest economy, has been
suffering a financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and
bad loans of financial institutions since late last year.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a
bailout loan of 57 billion dollars, South Korea has to restructure
its economy, open its market and carry out a mass layoff.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Independence of Immigration Affairs, Proof of "One Country, Two Systems" by Lu Jin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The independence in managing
immigration affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) of China has been an evidence of the successful
implementation of the "one country, two systems" policy, an SAR
government official said.
</P>
<P>
Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, HKSAR's director of immigration, said in
an exclusive interview with Xinhua that Hong Kong has remained a
separate tourism area after its return to China last July and that
the SAR enjoys a high degree of autonomy in immigration affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration Department "directly takes part in" the
implementation of the relevant regulations in the Basic Law
concerning residency rights, Ip said. She described the work of
the department over the part year as "very smooth and successful"
under the framework of "one country, two systems," an
"unprecedented" practice in history.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the way the Immigration Department
functions "did not change at all" compared with the pre-handover
period, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law provides that the SAR government may apply
immigration controls on entry into, stay in and departure from the
region by persons from foreign states and regions. Entry into the
SAR of persons from China's inland areas is regulated in
accordance with the pre-handover practice. The Immigration
Department is tasked to exercise these functions.
</P>
<P>
Ip noted that the Hong Kong residents' freedom of traveling out
of Hong Kong has been fully guaranteed after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that 15,322,000 Hong Kong residents departed
from Hong Kong on tourist or business trips abroad from January to
April this year. The number was 16.7 percent more than that for
the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Active in World Affairs: U.N. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Under Secretary-General Jin
Yongjian said during his talks with Kenyan Foreign Minister
Bonaya Godana Thursday that U.N. attaches much importance to the
rising and active role of Kenya especially in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya is a very important member in the United Nations" and
"Nairobi will always be the center of the (east African) region,"
Jin said. Kenya hosts the headquarters of U.N. Environment
Program and quite a number of U.N. agencies' regional offices.
</P>
<P>
Godana said Kenya has been actively working with the U.N.
since its independence in 1963 and making great efforts towards
regional peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is always ready to "cushion off regional conflicts,"
said Godana who just returned from a three-day state visit to
war-prolonged Sudan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustapha Othman Ismail has revealed
at their talks the "willingness" of the Moslem-dominated Khartoum
regime to settle the 15-year-old civil war with the animist and
Christian-populated south, Godana said.
</P>
<P>
There now exists a "genuine" momentum towards peace in Sudan,
he claimed, adding that the Sudan peace talks will go on as
planned in Addis Ababa in August despite on-going border row
between Ethiopia and Eritrea, both members of Inter-Governmental
Authority of Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
However, he said Wednesday that the outbreak of war last month
pitting Ethiopia and Eritrea is a "setback" to the IGAD grouping
seven Horn of Africa and east African countries.
</P>
<P>
"The war between the two countries was totally unexpected.
There is a great challenge to IGAD now than ever before," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, IGAD remains the only "serious and focused
organization to act as a forum to take away pressure from warring
countries," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
IGAD was established by regional states in the late 1980s as
an economic body to check desertification and enhance economic
ties in the region, but has in the 1990s focused on the
resolution of armed conflicts among the member states.

BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC),
the State Economic and Trade Commission, and the State
Administration of Taxation said today that money-losing
state-owned enterprises need to be given support to make products

The circular said that that credit designated to produce
good-selling and profitable products must be used for that
purpose, and must be paid back.

<HEADLINE> 268,000 Mozambicans Enjoy Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 268,000 people from
6,339 enterprises in Mozambique have registered for social
insurance, according to an official from the National Institute
of Social Security (INSS).
</P>
<P>
Victor Zacarias, chairman of the INSS administrative council,
was quoted by the Noticias newspaper Thursday as saying that INSS
has set up offices in the capital cities of every province in the
country as well as ten counties.
</P>
<P>
At the inauguration ceremony of the INSS new headquarters
Wednesday, he said the INSS plans to cover all regions where
there are enterprises and laborers so as to ensure that social
insurance is enjoyed and material conditions of life are
safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
The chairman revealed that at least 1,033 enterprises and over
80,000 workers have not registered so far in the social security
system. Therefore, he said, they could not enjoy relevant
treatment when their companies get privatized, paralysed or run
in red.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano who attended the
inauguration ceremony, said "Social security system is the fruit
of national independence, before which few laborers could enjoy
it."
</P>
<P>
Chissano admitted that there is still big gaps in income
distribution between people in the urban areas and countryside,
and between those who work and who don't.
</P>
<P>
He asked the INSS administrative council to study the problem
and apply its funds to create more job opportunities to increase
income and expand the coverage of social security.

<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Floods resulting from two weeks of
torrential rains which have pelted east China's Jiangxi Province
have destroyed 200,000 houses and affected over seven million
people, in addition to destroying dozens of embankments and
blocking highways.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Jiangxi Provincial Flood Control and
Drought Relief Headquarters show that over half of Jiangxi's
counties and cities have suffered from consecutive days of
torrential rains since June 12. The headquarters also reported that
water levels along six rivers, including the Yangtze River, and Poyang
Lake have far exceeded warning levels.
</P>
<P>
The heaviest flooding in northeastern Jiangxi affected 860,000
people and left more than 100,000 people homeless. A total of
560,000 hectares of farmland has been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at various levels have mobilized manpower
and materials for flood relief efforts, and more than 300,000
people besieged by flood waters have been moved to higher ground.
</P>
<P>
South China's Guangdong Province is also bracing for possible
flooding along the Xijiang and Beijiang rivers, two major
Pearl River tributaries.
</P>
<P>
Local reports indicate that torrential rain since June 16 has
raised water levels along both rivers.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological departments forecast continuing torrential rain
will raise water levels in southwestern areas in the Pearl River
Delta.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Greek President Visits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos Thursday reiterated his country's support to the
Cypriot people for a just and viable solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark upon his arrival here for a four-day
official visit to Cyprus, the first of its kind since the
establishment of the Republic of Cyprus in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos said at the welcoming ceremony, hosted by
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides, that it was a "great honour"
for him to be the first Greek president to visit the island.
</P>
<P>
"I convey the message that Cyprus is a national issue of top
priority for Greece, which fully supports the struggle of
Cypriots for freedom, independence and territorial integrity of
the Republic of Cyprus," the Greek president said.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos accused Turkey of continuously violating
international law in Cyprus since 1974 and of its recent threats.
</P>
<P>
He said Greek and Turkish Cypriots should live in a united,
bicommunal federal state, that will definitely become a full
member of the EU, which "will benefit both communities and all
Cypriots."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in 1974 in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Greek president said during his stay he will
review recent developments in the political problem and discuss
Cyprus' course to EU accession.
</P>
<P>
He said the present status quo is unacceptable and urged the
international community not to tolerate the continued illegal
occupation of part of Cyprus by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos added that the talks will also look into ways of
qualitative improvement of the joint defense pact between Cyprus
and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Cyprus and Greece agreed in November 1993 to
adopt a joint defense pact, providing that Greece would come in
aid of Cyprus in case of a new Turkish offensive.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Clerides said that Stephanopoulos' presence sends
the message that Greece, which is a guarantor power of the Cyprus
Republic, is in the same trench with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Cyprus and Greece have "strong national and
brotherly bonds," to the benefit of stability, peace and security
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Greek president's visit comes amid tension on the island
where a tit-for-tat show of force between Greece and Turkey took
place last week.
</P>
<P>
Six Greek warplanes landed for the first time at the
newly-completed Paphos military air base on the west coast of
Cyprus earlier last week.
</P>
<P>
Turkey then sent six F-16 fighters to the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern Cyprus in retaliation, and five
Turkish warships also visited the two ports in northern part of
the island.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, have long been at odds
over, among other things, this strategic Eastern Mediterranean
island.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is running a
trade surplus with the United States for the first time in years,
according to U.S. statistics reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-South African trade balance moved in the latter's
favor in April, when South Africa recorded a 19-million-Dollar
surplus, Business Day daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of the year, the surplus stands at
nine million Dollars, compared with a 255-million-Dollar deficit
over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
South African exports to the U.S. in the first four months of
the year reached 1.01 billion Dollars, a 43 percent increase over
last year's performance. U.S. exports to South Africa were up
only 35 million Dollars to 999 million.
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, South Africa's annual deficit with
the U.S. has ranged between 500,000 Dollars and 700 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jerry Feldman, the U.S. Commerce Department's South African
desk officer, said much of the shift was probably accounted for
by the Rand's fall against the Dollar.

<HEADLINE> Macao Papers: Clinton's China Visit to Push Forward Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit
to China marks the complete normalization of China-U.S. relations
since 1989 and will help push forward the relations, a commentary
in Thursday's Macao newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary in the Chinese-language Correio Sino-Macaense
daily said that the current visit to China means the formal start
of the regular meeting mechanism between the heads of state of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Clinton's visit to China will improve the environment of U.S.
diplomacy and help transfer the focus of attention from some
domestic affairs. It will also help raise the popularity rate of
the Democratic Party in the upcoming Congress election in
November," said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the visit will "help increase exchanges with
China in political, economic, security and military fields," and
help the formation of a "constructive strategic partnership"
between the two, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tai Chung Pou newspaper said that the attempt of
the right-wing group in the U.S. Congress to disrupt Clinton's
visit has proved futile because a strong trend to back
Sino-U.S. cooperation and further development of
Sino-U.S. relations has risen in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"This trend has gained an upper hand in the United States," it
said. "The trend reflects the wishes of the majority of the U.S.
society, and is in compliance with the common and long-term
interests of the two countries."

<HEADLINE> Major Oil and Gas Reserves Found in Junggar Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China reported new findings of oil and natural
gas reserves in the Junggar Basin during the first five months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Eight exploratory wells in the basin were tested to have oil
and gas, covering an oil-bearing area of 82 square kilometers,
which is estimated to increase 65 million tons of oil and 14
billion cubic meters of gas, said Wang Yilin, deputy director of
the Xinjiang Petroleum Administrative Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The No.5 test well in the east of the basin was found to have a
daily capacity of 56 tons of oil and 2,800 cubic meters of gas,
with an oil-bearing area of 20 square kilometers. Together with
the neighboring Shanan Oil Field, it will grow into a large oil
and gas field of 100 million tons of proven reserves.
</P>
<P>
While in the hinterland of the basin, the No.2 well was tested
to pump 34 tons of oil and 50,000 cubic meters of gas daily,
involving an area of 30 square kilometers and 20 million tons of
proven reserves.
</P>
<P>
By last year, 21 oil and gas fields had been found in the
130,000-square-kilometer basin over the past four decades, and the
oil and gas fields yielded 8.7 million tons of oil and 1.2 billion
cubic meters of gas in 1997, ranking fourth in China.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Namibia to Charge Apartheid-Era Spies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of a South
African-Namibian joint focus group could lead to the prosecution
of a number of South African operatives for crimes they committed
in Namibia in the apartheid era, local media said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The focus group was set up after a meeting between South
African Justice Minister Dullah Omar and his Namibian
counterpart, Ngarikutuke Tjiriange, in Windhoek two weeks ago,
the Business Day newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Omar said Wednesday that the Namibian government had indicated
during the meeting that it would like to make a number of
extradition applications for common law crimes such as murder,
but that some of those mentioned included former apartheid
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Among those named were Civil Cooperation Bureau chief Joe
Verster as well as operatives Ferdi Barnard and Wouter Basson.
</P>
<P>
Tjiriange said the focus group would investigate several
pending cases and would not open its net wide to all
apartheid-era crimes.
</P>
<P>
Among the cases which would be tackled by the group included
the September 1989 assassination of Namibian human rights
activist Anton Lubowski and the 1989 attack on the United Nations
office in Outjo during the Namibian elections there.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, an inquest by now retired judge Haroldt Levy found
that operatives from the bureau were involved in Lubowski's
killing.
</P>
<P>
Omar said the Lubowski matter had been discussed separately.
He said that the Namibian government had requested no specific
extraditions, but had rather asked for a number of South African
witnesses to be subpoenaed to testify in Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
The focus group would include Pretoria attorney-general Jan
D'Oliviera, Omar's chief consultant Mehard Rwelamira and Namibian
prosecutor-general Hans Heyman.

NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan exports to India grew by
49 percent to 32 billion Shillings (22 million U.S. Dollars) in
the 1996/97 fiscal year, a high level meeting of local and Indian
investors heard.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya exports (to India) in the last three years have been
growing on a sustained basis," a local source said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports from India have dropped from a peak of 250
million U.S. Dollars in the 1995/96 period to about 180 million
U.S. Dollars, Thursday's Daily Nation newspaper reported.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Release of Nigeria's Top Political Detainee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The widespread news about the
release of Nigeria's number one political detainee, Chief Moshood
Abiola, is a mere rumor, his wife has told the Daily Times.
</P>
<P>
The release of Abiola, the presumed winner of the annulled
June 12, 1993 presidential election in Nigeria, is widely
regarded as a key to the national reconciliation after the sudden
death of former head of state General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
There was widespread jubilation and merriment Wednesday in
parts of the country over the reported release of him.
</P>
<P>
At his home in Lagos, friends, well-wishers and relations, who
called were served food and drinks, amid dancing and singing, the
Daily Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But his wife told newsmen Wednesday at his residence that her
husband's release was a mere rumor, the semi-government newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have people in Abuja (the capital) to consult us, we don't
know the source of this information. We can't say categorically
that he had been released except to keep our fingers cross," the
wife was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But she admitted that the family had prepared for the return
of Abiola by repainting the house and cleaning the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Nigerian government is parleying with
Abiola over his continued detention.
</P>
<P>
The new head of state, General Abdulsalam Abubakar, was said
to hold talks with the business baron over dinner, which was
followed by breakfast earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
According to This Day, one of the leading dailies in Nigeria,
the government has proposed to release him but on condition that
he would not embark on another round of agitation over his
perceived mandate.
</P>
<P>
If he agrees to the proposal, the government is likely to
withdraw the treasonable felony charge preferred against him for
declaring himself president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on
June 10, 1994.
</P>
<P>
There has been increasing appeals from Abiola's supporters
that he should be released and lead a government of national
unity.

<HEADLINE> Referees' Head Says Three Games' Refereeing Dissatisfactory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Refereeing in three out of the 40 games
played until now was not satisfactory, the FIFA Referees Committee
Chairman David Will said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Of course there have been some mistakes, It was absolutely
impossible to go through forty matches without mistakes...There are
only three performances out of forty which we were not satisfied,"
Will said.
</P>
<P>
But he said the overall standards for the referees and assistants
here was higher than it was in the last edition in the United States
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The overall standard is higher than it was in the U.S.A," he said.
"In the U.S.A you may recall that it was critisms of the assistants'
performances that was the highest on the agenda."
</P>
<P>
"It is not occurrent at this World Cup. The quality of the
performance of the assistants has been absolutely, extraordinarily
high," said Will.
</P>
<P>
He conceded that there were mistakes that "were clear in slow
motion in television but very difficult to read in a split of a second
by the assistant."
</P>
<P>
Will said the average mark of the assistants' performance in the
previous matches was 8.5 on a scale of 10.
</P>
<P>
He said the FIFA Referees Committee had yet to decide the match
officials for the second round matches.

<HEADLINE> South African Coach Blasts Squad for Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- After the South Africa's
World Cup hopes were dashed Wednesday as the team were held to a
2-2 draw against Saudi Arabia, coach Philippe Troussier said it
was a lack of fighting spirit that had led to the result.
</P>
<P>
The match was considered "a must-win" as Saudi Arabia was
arguably the weakest side in Group C and a big win could stand
South Africa a chance to advance to the second round.
</P>
<P>
But the draw, following an earlier draw against Denmark and a
defeat at the hands of France, only place the team third in the
group with two points.
</P>
<P>
A deeply disappointed Troussier said his players had not had
the will to get far in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very average World Cup tournament for us. We have
talent but when there's no will, no courage, no spirit, we cannot
go far. Above all I'm disappointed by the way we obtained our two
points from the three group matches," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I never felt there has been that sort of mentality in the
South African team. I never felt there was that little bit extra
which makes them go out and play for every ball," the 43-year-old
Frenchman said.
</P>
<P>
Troussier said he had done everything he could to instil the
necessary confidence the team needed for an assignment as tough as
the World Cup finals, but the team lacked a leader who could
inspire them to reach for a higher level.
</P>
<P>
The coach said he was disappointed with the result and he truly
believed they had a good chance to qualify for the next round.
</P>
<P>
Troussier, who angered many players for his "dictatorial"
training approach during his three months tenure, said he had not
have a plan for the immediate future and he would take a rest
before getting a new commitment.
</P>
<P>
The coach has already had talks with Sheffield Wednesday, a
England club, and has also been approached by Saudi Arabia and
linked to the Tunisian coach's job recently vacated by Polish-born
Frenchman Henri Kasperczak.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Troussier's claims of lack of commitment, central
defender Mark Fish said the conditions they played under in the
World Cup were tough.
</P>
<P>
"That is ridiculous. We knew what we were here for and were
playing for our pride and the pride of our country. It was always
important for us to do our best. But the conditions were against
us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fish said he was disappointed at the axing and subsequent
despatching home of Brendan Augustine and Aaron Mokoena this week
for staying late in a nightclub until the next morning. The
dismissal of the two further weakened the squad hit by a string of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
"I think it could've been handled differently," he said,
disagreeing with the South African Football Association's
decision.

GENEVA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-based Internet Society
(ISOC) is to set up its permanent regional office in Geneva, said
the ISOC Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The very immediate work of the office is to prepare the ISOC's
annual conference, also known as Internet Summit, scheduled for
July 21 through 24 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Its future tasks will include providing enhanced the ISOC's

revenue raising activities.
</P>
<P>
One of the main sponsors for the Internet Summit in late July,
Geneva Financial Center Foundation, has pledged 150,000
U.S. dollars to support the Geneva-based permanent office.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why it has chosen Geneva, the ISOC said the city is
a logical choice due to its strategic geographical location in
relation to the targeted areas.
</P>
<P>
Geneva also hosts key international organizations such as the
World Trade Organization, the International Telecommunication

<HEADLINE> Mandela Praises South African Team's Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela on Wednesday praised the national soccer team's
overall performance in the World Cup finals although it was
knocked out of the tournament with a 2-2 draw against Saudi Arabia
in its last Group C match Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have not been disgraced at all. Bafana Bafana (name of
South Africa's national team) have done very well for their first
appearance at the World Cup," Mandela said in a statement issued
by his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
There is good reason for South Africans to be proud of their
team, the president said. The squad placed third in the group
after a 3-0 defeat at hands of the French and two draws against
Denmark and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"The skill Bafana Bafana displayed shows we can compete against
any team in the world. In the next World Cup we will do better,"
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
"A good foundation has been laid and we need to build on it,"
said Mandela, who sent each player a personal good-luck message
before the start of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The comments contrasted sharply with those of national coach
Philippe Troussier. The French coach said the team, though having
talent, lacked will and courage to go far in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) also congratulated
Bafana Bafana, saying the participation of the squad and other
four African teams in the World Cup had highlighted the sporting
potential and talent that the continent possessed.
</P>
<P>
But it said the fact that only one African team qualified for
the second round showed that there was much room for improvement
in the administration of sport.
</P>
<P>
"The lesson that must be drawn is that Africa should continue
to unearth and harness this potential and talent through a
concerted youth development program within the framework of the
transformation of sport, arts and culture," the ANC said.
</P>
<P>
Only Nigeria advance to the knock-out phase of the competition
while Tunisia, Cameroon, Morocco and South Africa were eliminated
in the group match stage.

<HEADLINE> No Deflation In China's Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The increase in the number of unemployed people is not the
result of an economic depression, economists say. There are now 5
million people out of work, and another 10 million who have been
laid off and are still waiting for jobs.
</P>
<P>
Xiao explains that the state-owned enterprises began under a
planned economic system, so unemployment is the obvious result of
starting to consider efficiency and reducing the payroll by laying
off workers in the market economy.
</P>
<P>
China's inflation from 1993 to 1995 was so high that the price
of some goods departed radically from their real value and it
takes time to adjust those prices. Xiao says he thinks the
adjustment will bring inflation down to the normal level, but
without deflation, judging from a year's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
A number of steps have been taken to ensure 8 percent growth in
spite of the East Asian financial crisis, like encouraging
consumer spending and increasing infrastructure spending. Spending
on fixed assets was up 12.7 percent from January to May and is
expected to go up by more than 15 percent for 1998. Spending on
infrastructure in urban areas will exceed 400 billion yuan for the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, the governor of the People's Bank of China,
recently announced that China has increased the money supply and
the number of medium- and long-term loans while keeping a fairly
tight money policy. By the end of May, there was 9.4 trillion yuan
in broad money (M2), a rise of 15.5 percent from last year's
comparable figure.
</P>
<P>
Medium- and long-term loans in the first five months of the
year accounted for 21 percent of the total amount of loans and 32
percent of new loans.
</P>
<P>
The State Money Policy Committee and State Economic and Trade
Commission say that the basic way to avoid deflation is for the
Central Government and the public to understand the political
significance of economic growth completely. When a majority of the
people understand the dangers of deflation and efforts are made to
prevent it, the possibility of deflation will be very small.

<HEADLINE> US, UK Accept S. Africa's Denial of Libyan Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Britain have said they accepted South Africa's statement that it
was not involved in an arms-for-oil deal with Libya, the Business
Day newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are at the center of an international
standoff with Libya over the Lockerbie airliner bombing, which
killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British officials said Wednesday that they had no
reason to doubt an emphatic denial from South African President
Nelson Mandela's office of a story first published in the London
Sunday Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
The officials were speaking in the wake of a statement by the
newspaper's foreign editor, Con Coughlin, that he stood by his
report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that South Africa had concluded a secret
500-million-U.S.-Dollar deal to supply Libya with weapons and
spare parts in return for cut-price oil, and Mandela had approved
the deal.
</P>
<P>
Jan Lodal, the U.S. defense policy principal and Deputy
Undersecretary of Defense, said in Midrand, South Africa that
"our position is that we accept the representations of the South
African government and that we have no reason to do otherwise."
</P>
<P>
Lodal said that the U.S. had mechanisms which would have
allowed it to be informed if a deal had been done.
</P>
<P>
"Had it happened, we might have had reason to do something
about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had no reason to distrust South Africa, was happy
with its approach to arms exports and controls, and saw no threat
to U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
There were no open issues and differences in the past, said
Lodal.
</P>
<P>
Lodal placed one rider on his statement, which he said was
based on some access to intelligence sources while he was
traveling.
</P>
<P>
"Should the allegations be true, we would of course be
unhappy."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the British High Commission, Michael Doig,
said that the British government had taken note of the South
African government's emphatic denial of the arms-for-oil deal
with Libya.
</P>
<P>
He said the British government saw no reason to doubt it.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sanctions, including an arms
embargo, on Libya after Tripoli refused to surrender two Libyan
suspects of the air disaster.
</P>
<P>
The U. S. and Britain demanded a trial of the two Libyans in
Scotland where the crash occurred, while Libya, supported by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), asked for a neutral venue.
The issue is in the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
South Africa earlier this month backed an OAU resolution
calling on the U.N. to immediately suspend sanctions against
Libya until the International Court of Justice delivered a final
decision on the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Should the suspension not be lifted by July, OAU member states
reserved the right to ignore the sanctions in view of the
immensely harmful effects, both human and economic, on the Libyan
people, said the resolution.

<P>
SEOUL, June 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is trying to downplay
the incursion of a submarine of the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) into South Korean waters, in the hope that the
incident will not affect improved inter-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
A DPRK submarine was caught by the South Korean Navy Monday
afternoon after it was spotted entangled in a fishing dragnet off
the East Sea, some 11 miles of South Korea's Sokcho city.
</P>
<P>
The incident has cast a shadow over the improving atmosphere
between the two sides since Kim Dae-jung became South Korean
president on February 25 this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the incident might temper President Kim's
"aggressive" engagement policy towords the DPRK based on his
principle of separating politics from business and force him to
change his policy under pressures from the military and opposition
party.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kim Dae-jung government has taken unusual measures
in response to the sub incident, which, South Korean military
authorities and opposition party alleged, was a military
aggression and a violation of the military armistice agreement
signed in 1953.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, one day after the incident, President Kim said his
government would assess the incident in a cautious manner after a
comprehensive investigation of the sub, and on Wednesday he said
he would not change his "sunshine policy" of more dialogues, more
reconciliation and more cooperation with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say Kim's government has intentionally slowed
down the tugging of the sunk sub to a South Korean naval base to
win the time necessary to minimize the incident's impact on the
ongoing "friendly atmosphere" characterized by South Korean
business tycoon Chung Ju-yung's recent historic visit to the DPRK
via the truce village of Panmunjom and a military general-level
dialogue between U.S. and DPRK armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the high-level military talks and Chung's
passage through Panmunjom were hailed by the Kim Dae-jung
government as an indication that the DPRK was easing its "hardline
stance."
</P>
<P>
Such response is in sharp contrast to a similar event which
flared in September 1996, which witnessed inter-Korean ties hit
their lowest ebb.
</P>
<P>
The then Kim Young-sam government had immediately described the
DPRK's submarine infiltration as "a clear armed provocation" and
severed all contacts with the DPRK while referring the issue to
the United Nations for a sanction against the country.
</P>
<P>
The incident terribly strained the inter-Korean relations for a
prolonged period though the Kim Young-sam administration
successfully forced the DPRK to issue an apology in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The past government failed to maintain consistency in dealing
with North Korean affairs. We will go ahead with the sunshine
policy aimed at opening the North and expanding inter-Korean
exchanges," said Park Jie-won, South Korean presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The incident further awakened us to the need to engage the
North in a more positive manner," said Li Dong-won, President
Kim's top foreign policy and security advisor.
</P>
<P>
Some observers predicted that President Kim will return the sub
to the DPRK as another significant friendly gesture no matter
whether the sub infiltrated into South Korean waters for a spy
mission or drifted there due to mechanical problems as the DPRK
claimed, but he needs an official apology or regret from the DPRK
to clear away concerns in his country.

<HEADLINE>   Australian Job Vacancies Stay Strong in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia's employment outlook
received a boost Thursday when the government published figures
showing a strong increase in job vacancies in the three months up
to May.
</P>
<P>
Total job vacancies in the private and public sectors rose a
seasonally adjusted 8.8 percent in the May quarter, the Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the previous quarter, job vacancies also jumped a seasonally
adjusted 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said the trend estimate for job vacancies, of 78,100
in May, was the highest level recorded.
</P>
<P>
"This is the highest recorded level of vacancies and continues
the steady rise in estimates of job vacancies from the low of
57,200 in last August," the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello told the parliament that the figures
followed strong rises in the previous two quarters "and support a
strong outlook for firm employment growth for Australia
generally."
</P>
<P>
Costello said Thursday's strong data followed a period of low
interest rates and a sensible budget position, but the government
would continue to look at labor market reform.
</P>
<P>
"The less the burdens in relation to employment, the less the
drag on employers creating jobs, the greater the opportunity for
creating new jobs," Costello said when he was answering questions
in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> China Reorganizes Certified Accounting Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide massive check-up has
been carried out on China's certified accounting firms and
certified public accountants to streamline the industry.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Chinese Institute of Certified Public
Accountants said that more than 5,300 unqualified accountants have
been stripped of their credentials as a result of the check-up.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 103 accounting firms and nearly 1,000 branches of
which failed to meet required standards have been closed.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the institute said that the check-up has
brought more young professionals into the industry, with some
6,000 young certified accountants joining accounting firms during
the past year.
</P>
<P>
The check-up has also helped push the system reform process of
accounting firms. So far, more than 400 firms have voluntarily
joined hands, of which 47 have formed six interregional groups of
accounting firms.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that, after the conclusion of the check-up
and reorganization, new credentials will be issued to qualified
accountants and firms to standardize the industry.
</P>
<P>
Related departments will also step up professional training and
accelerate the construction of a state accounting college in an
effort to train accountants to meet international standards for
certification.

<HEADLINE> EU Delegation to Visit Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU) delegation
headed by the British Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd will
arrive in Nigeria Thursday to discuss the west African country's
transition to democracy with its new leader General Abdulsalam
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Anne Macro, the Third Secretary of the British High
Commission in Lagos#,was quoted by the Guardian newspaper as
saying Wednesday that the "Mr. Lloyd will visit Nigeria, on
Thursday evening, in his EU Presidency capacity."
</P>
<P>
"EU partners have agreed to the visit, exceptionally outside
the common position, in order to assess the political situation
following the positive changes that have taken place in Nigeria
this month," the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's visit was arranged in a phone call made by British
Prime Minister Tony Blair Wednesday to General Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
According to Blair's spokesman, the prime minister called
Abubakar on behalf of the EU to establish contact and urge him to
introduce civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Blair described the recent release of some
political detainees as a "welcome sign" and raised concerns over
human rights and remaining detainees.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Abubakar discussed the continued detention of
Moshood Abiola, the believed winner of the June 12, 1993
presidential election, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The sudden death of late head of state General Sani Abacha on
June 8, has put Nigeria's transition to civil rule program at a
cross road, as his death deprived the sole candidate of the
presidential election scheduled for August 1.
</P>
<P>
The new leadership headed by Abubakar, the former Chief of
Defense Staff, has been under great pressure from both home and
the international society to continue the transition program.
</P>
<P>
On June 14, U.S. President Bill Clinton also phoned Abubakar,
urging him to implement "a credible and lasting transition to
civilian government."
</P>
<P>
Abubakar's promise to continue the transition program,
especially his goodwill gesture of releasing nine political
detainees, including former head of state General Olusegun
Obasanjo, has earned him some trust by the Western world.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation will be the first of its kind for some
years, as Nigeria has been under sanctions by the West for its
military rule and poor human rights records.

<HEADLINE> Expert Calls for Multifaceted Social Security for Ethnic Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legal expert Zhang Wenshan
today called for establishing a multifaceted social security
system in China's ethnic areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a resident of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, said the system should be designed to further improve the
pension insurance, medical protection and poverty-relief for
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Statistics reveal the nation's 55 ethnic groups have a total
population of 84 million, or seven percent of the country's total
population. The vast majority of the ethnic groups inhabit
underdeveloped areas in west China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is currently carrying out research
concerning the development of social security in related areas,
with foreign scholars also exhibiting great interest in the topic.
</P>
<P>
"Establishing a multifaceted social security system will help
solve social problems such as unemployment, poverty, disease,
ecological degradation and natural disasters in ethnic areas,"
said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He said the most important facet centers on providing relief
funds for poverty-stricken families and providing special support
allowances for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
"The second major facet involves retaining the existing pension
system under which collective farms and the younger generation are
responsible for the support of the elderly," said Zhang, adding
that sufficient and efficient medical security is essential for
members of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the third facet focuses on encouraging members of
ethnic groups to purchase a variety of social insurance items to
protect family property and avoid losses from disasters, and the
risks involved in farming and cultivation.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that China should adopt related laws and
regulations governing the social security system in ethnic areas.

<HEADLINE> Upper House Election Campaigns Start in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 480 candidates officially
kicked off their campaigns Thursday for winning 126 of the 252
seats at the Upper House of the Japanese Diet, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
The July 12 election is a test of public confidence on Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto over his economic policy that has
failed to revitalize the sluggish Japanese economy, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
One focus is on whether the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) will convince voters about its proposed measures to boost
Japan's sagging economy and regain an Upper House simple majority.
</P>
<P>
While the LDP calls for a 16 trillion yen (about 114.3 billion
dollars) stimulus package, opposition parties promise a major tax
cut and accuse the Hashimoto cabinet of failing to implement
proper economic policies.
</P>
<P>
A total of 462 candidates of 13 political parties and groups
finished registering early in the day, comprising 155 candidates
for proportional representation seats and 307 for prefectural
constituency seats.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, leaders of the political parties launched their
parties' campaigns at various locations, with Hashimoto making the
LDP pitch in front of the Japan Railway (JR) Yotsuya Station in
Tokyo's Shinjuku Ward.
</P>
<P>
The total number of candidates is likely to be the smallest
since the Upper House started the current proportional
constituency system in 1983, falling sharply from the 567
candidates in the previous election held in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of the LDP's current 118 upper chamber seats, 61 are being
contested. The LDP will field 87 candidates.
</P>
<P>
In line with the revised Public Offices Election Law, polling
stations will be open until 8 p.m. on July 12, two hours longer
than the previous election, so as to prevent a further drop in
voter turnout. There are currently an estimated 99 million
eligible voters for the election.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Inflation Rate Estimated at 80 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
estimated that inflation rate in the 1998-99 fiscal year will
reach 80 percent, Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"But it (the inflation rate) is expected to decrease in the
next few months," the minister told reporters after accompanying
President B.J. Habibie during a meeting with International
Monetary Fund (IMF) Director for Asia Pacific Hubert Neiss.
</P>
<P>
Habibie and Neiss met to discuss the completion of the Second
Supplementary Text for the Memorandum on Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP).
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said more international assistance would be needed to
cover deficits in the state budget so that the central bank would
not need to print money.
</P>
<P>
The government predicts that deficit will reach between 8
billion and 8.5 billion U.S. dollars, half of which could be
sourced from foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
"We have to seek another source for the other half," he said,
stressing that the government will not mint new money to cover the
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the MEFP, Ginandjar said, important points contained
in the memorandum include the gross domestic product (GDP) which
is expected to decrease by more than 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also stated that the government will continue to
provide subsidies for staple food, particularly rice.
</P>
<P>
Another important point of the memorandum is the government's
plan to make special policies that will secure food supply.
Subsidies for basic commodities will increase sharply this year,
the memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after the meeting, Neiss said the IMF
Board of Directors will meet on July 8 to discuss when the IMF
will disburse the second tranche of 3 billion dollars supposed to
be channeled in stages in May, June and July.
</P>
<P>
The IMF promised last October to provide 10 billion dollars of
the 43 billion dollar bailout fund which the agency brokered to
bail out Indonesia's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia received the first tranche of 3 billion dollars from
the IMF in November last year, but the second disbursement of
another 3 billion dollars was delayed due to riots in Jakarta in
May and the political crisis in the country which forced former
President Soeharto to step down.
</P>
<P>
"There is no 100 percent assurance (that a decision will be
made on July 8). But now, there is international support for the
disbursement of the second tranche of the IMF aid package," Neiss
said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian MP Barred from Parliamentary Sessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian member of
parliament has been suspended from attending the on-going
parliamentary sessions because he failed to produce evidence for
his allegations that the government plotted to assassinate him.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly, or parliament, made the suspension
decision on Wednesday after MPs voted to reject evidence tendered
by Augustine Mrema, the MP for Temeke, whose evidence came mostly
from reports by tabloids, Dar es Salaam newspapers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Mrema has failed to tender evidence on the alleged top
government meeting which discussed the assassination plot. The
House has no choice but punish him," declared Pius Msekwa,
speaker of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Mrema, known as the national chairman of a major opposition
party National Convention for Construction and Reform (NCCR),
presented to the National Assembly at the budget session Monday
his evidence to show that the government plotted to kill him and
two others before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a 13-page statement, Mrema maintained that the government,
at a meeting in April of 1996, planned to eliminate him, the late
Lt. Gen. Imran Kombe, former director General of Intelligence and
Security, and Seif Shariff Hamad, vice chairman of the opposition
party Civic United Front (CUF).
</P>
<P>
Mrema claimed that the killing of Kombe by police in 1996 was
part of the implementation of the planned government measures.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye flatly denied Mrema's
allegations saying that the government did not have any plans to
murder its citizens for whatever reasons.
</P>
<P>
When a parliamentary session started Wednesday afternoon,
Mrema was allowed by the Speaker to give a summary of his
defense.
</P>
<P>
The house then debated the issue and concluded that Mrema had
failed to produce authentic evidence as most of his proofs were
based on hearsay from the tabloids of Shaba, Heko and Alasiri.
</P>
<P>
Reading the resolution of the house, Kingunge Ngombale-Mwiru,
Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office, said "Mrema's
allegations are meaningless and have undermined the integrity of
the House and that of the MPs... And they can create divisions
among the general public."
</P>
<P>
He proposed for the suspension of Mrema's attendance to
current parliamentary sessions with immediate effect. The
proposals were adopted by the MPs.
</P>
<P>
Pleading for mercy, Mrema, also a former Minister of Home
Affairs, requested his fellow MPs to be lenient with him, citing
his previous achievements and the fact that he has a wife and
children, some of whom are still in primary school.
</P>
<P>
Mrema said he hadn't expected that the punishment could be so
harsh.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- No fewer than 20,334 Nigerians have
been confirmed to be currently infected by AIDS, compared with
the 7,500 figure recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by the National AIDS and STD Control
Program at a forum here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The attitude of the society to the people living with HIV/AIDS
is the core reason for the rapid increase in the number of such
people, noted Eme Ekaette, president of the Pharmaceutical
Society of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
That explained why the people shy away from seeking counseling
on management and treatment of the deadly disease, she said,
appealing to the society to change their attitude and assist such
people.

<HEADLINE> German FM Reiterates Opposition to Kosovo's Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo-Albanians should not
cherish any illusion about an independent state, said German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said this at a news conference after meeting with
Kosovo-Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in Bonn Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot support anything but autonomy for Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Western countries would not accept a
continuation of the status quo in Kosovo and would not like to see
further violence in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been running high in Kosovo since February, when
Serbian police clashed with ethnic Albanians seeking independence
from Belgrade and integration into neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has stripped autonomy of the ethnic Albanians, who
make up 90 percent of the province's population, since early 1990s
and is strongly opposed to any external intervention in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts must still be to get both sides to come to a
political solution," Kinkel said, adding that the world community
should maintain the pressure on Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
However, he also warned Kosovo-Albanians not to count on a NATO
military intervention "tomorrow," saying that such a move must be
approved by the UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kosovo-Albanian leader Rugova insisted that he was
still striving for independence for Kosovo in order to protect
ethnic Albanians from attacks by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
"The best solution would be an independent and neutral Kosovo,"
Rugova said, adding that as a transitional step, Kosovo should be
given the status of an international protectorate with security
guarantees for the Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to try to bring the ethnic Albanian rebel group
under his control.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Kinkel also urged Rugova to return to the
negotiating table for political dialogue with Belgrade. But Rugova
said that such talks had no chance to achieve any concrete results
given the continued attacks by Serbian forces.

<HEADLINE> Employees of Nepal Airlines on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- There is no single domestic
flight Thursday in Nepal as the employees of Nepal Airlines go on
strike after their eight-point demands are not met by the
management.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen to 20 domestic flights of the Royal Nepal Airlines
Corporation (RNAC), the country's flag carrier, can not take off
due to the strike, one employee working in the sales section of
the RNAC told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The corporation's Employees Coordination Committee comprising
pilots, employees and technicians presented an ultimatum to the
company chairman on June 11, demanding termination of short-term
leasing of aircraft from foreign countries, hiring of planes on
lease-purchase basis and appointment of managing director from
within the corporation.
</P>
<P>
Their other demands include immediate formulation and
implementation of new regulations, ending of economic
irregularities, increase of facilities and promotion for the
employees.
</P>
<P>
They alleged that it is due to lack of vision of the
management, financial irregularities and political interference
that the number of the aircraft in RNAC's fleet has decreased to
nine from 19 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The RNAC!!management and the Employees Coordination Committee
had held talks for the last few days but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
The committee had threatened to stage a relay hunger strike on
the RNAC premises for three days beginning Friday and launch even
stronger protest programs if its demands are not met by Sunday.

<HEADLINE> HK Jewelry &AMP; Watch Fair Popular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The recent economic downturn in
Asia does not seem to have distracted the interest of exhibitors
and traders at the June Hong Kong Jewelry &AMP; Watch Fair and Asia's
Fashion Jewelry &AMP; Accessories Fair, which are attracting a big
attendance.
</P>
<P>
Both fairs opened here on Thursday. The four-day Jewelry and
watch fair has drawn 527 exhibitors from 27 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
"More companies are looking for better ways to promote their
business by participating in major trade fairs," said Peter
Sutton, director of Miller Freeman Asia, the organizer of the
fair.
</P>
<P>
There were always new opportunities opening up as a result of
the change in the economic climate, Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
The impressive attendance reflects not only the importance of
global trading to the jewelry business, but also confirms
international confidence in Hong Kong as Asia's capital city for
the jewelry world. Hong Kong will continue to play a pivotal role
in this global business and more significantly, will further
establish its key position in trading with China's mainland, the
world's most promising market and growing jewelry manufacturing
base, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asia's Fashion Jewelry &AMP; Accessories Fair, a new global trade
fair in the region, is jointly organized by Miller Freeman and
Fiera Milano International, the organizer of the Chibi fair in
Milan, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Some 210 exhibitors from over 19 countries and regions are
participating in the four-day event.
</P>
<P>
Fiera Milano International led a group of Italian and French
exhibitors to set up a "Chibi Asia" section to showcase for the
first time in Asia a wide spectrum of stylish European fashion
jewelry and accessories.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Acts to Stimulate Economy by Chang Kefei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government has taken bold moves in
succession to revive the sliding economy battered by the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The latest initiative was a multi-billion rescue package
unveiled Monday in a bid to ease credit and liquidity crunch,
stabilize property prices, reduce burdens on families and
businesses, and restore people's confidence.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the economy is "at a critical stage", Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa pledged to adopt a pragmatic and timely
approach and take responsive measures to relieve the economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The financial turmoil that has been plaguing the region for
nearly a year has triggered a cascade of fallout in Hong Kong --
soaring interest rates, a credit crunch, a declining property
sector, falling stock prices, and sluggish tourism.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in a decade, Hong Kong recorded a negative
GDP growth of two percent in the first quarter of 1998. Its
unemployment rate also hit a 15-year high of 4.2 percent between
March and May.
</P>
<P>
The stimulus package froze all land sales until March 31, 1999,
to revive the property market, which has plunged some 40 percent
from the peak last year.
</P>
<P>
It also introduced a tax exemption on interest earned locally
from profit tax -- an arrangement which Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang said could bring in an estimated 200 billion HK dollars
(25.6 billion U.S. dollars) to the Hong Kong banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Other measures included a rebate on rates, a cut on diesel
duty, and a reduction on charges paid by importers and exporters,
all aimed at easing burdens on families and businesses. The
government also decided to freeze pay adjustments for more than
300 directorate officials.

<HEADLINE> Chissano Calls on Mozambicans to Actively </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano
has called on his people to actively participate in the first
local elections due to be held on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Chissano made the appeal Wednesday night at a national radio
speech marking the 23rd anniversary of the independence of
Mozambique which falls on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president called on the people in the 33 cities and towns
to actively and undauntedly take part in the elections scheduled
on June 30 in a calm, civilized and reconciliatory atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that Mozambique is facing with
difficulties in implementing self-governance in local areas such
as the lack of funds and materials, and the infrastructure, which
had been damaged during the civil war, needs to be rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
Chissano noted that the local elections are a great challenge
for Mozambique, but his government will confidently meet the
challenge in a bid to build up democracy, reconciliation, peace
and development.
</P>
<P>
The National Electoral Commission of Mozambique said Thursday
that it is coordinating with the government to ensure the
security in all poll posts.
</P>
<P>
The biggest opposition party, the Mozambican National
Resistance (Renamo), and other 16 opposition parties have
repeatedly threatened to make trouble in the elections.

<HEADLINE> CAS to Increase Number of Temporary Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) will increase its temporary employees to 30,000, or half of
the academy's total work force by 2010, Bai Chunli, vice-president
of CAS, said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
To recruit younger scientists and optimize the knowledge
structure, the CAS will begin to cut the number of its permanent
employees and add more guest researchers, visiting scholars, and
graduate, doctoral and postdoctoral students, Bai said.
</P>
<P>
The CAS plans to employ 600 outstanding Chinese and young
foreign scientists within three years, he said, and raise the
number of graduate students from the current 10,000 to 15,000.
</P>
<P>
The CAS will set up a prize this year to reward the most
outstanding of the 1,000-plus postdoctoral students of CAS, and
provide them with research funds, Bai said.
</P>
<P>
The CAS spends 2 million yuan (240,000 U.S. dollars) each year
as a special fund for postdoctoral students. It plans to grant 300
million yuan (36 million U.S. dollars) to build houses for
postdoctoral students before 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The training and employment of young scientists is the key for
the implementation of the knowledge innovation project in CAS,
which will help the academy stand at the core of the country's
scientific and technological development," Bai said.
</P>
<P>
The CAS has a staff of 68,000 people, about 12,000 of whom are
expected to retire within five years. Most of its temporary
employees are working in the 100-plus key opening laboratories of
the CAS.

<HEADLINE> No Deflation In China's Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- In the past two years, China's
economy has had slower growth, and state-owned enterprise
employees being laid off in increasing numbers, in addition to
adverse effects from the Southeast Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Some people have concluded that China's economy has entered a
period of depression caused by deflation, referring to a
contraction in the volume of available money or credit, resulting
in a decline in prices. Chinese economists, however, say that the
current macro-economic situation indicates that China's economy
has been normal and stable, and has not shown signs of deflation.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Zhuoji, a prominent economist and professor at Beijing
University, seconded the no-deflation opinion and said that fast
growth will generally remain. In the first quarter of this year,
China's economy grew at a rate of 7.2 percent and is expected to
be 8 percent for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Although this is obviously lower than the average, since
China's reforms and opening-up began in 1978, it is far higher
than the world average, and economic development will not always
be the same, Xiao says.
</P>
<P>
Hu Angang, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, says that China
has maintained relatively high economic growth and relatively low
inflation, and predicts that this will continue for the next two
or three years.
</P>
<P>
There has been a stockpiling of some consumer goods because the
country has changed from a buyer's to a seller's market, and not
because of a decline in purchase power. Prof. Xiao says that 86
percent of 600 major consumer products have a balance of supply
and demand, and only 14 percent with an excess of supply.
</P>
<P>
In a period when consumer spending has yet to reach a peak,
people in rural and urban areas are seeing income increases and
savings deposits are increasing by 800 billion yuan annually. By
the end of May, they amounted to more than 4.9 trillion yuan.

BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang today expressed China's concern over Japan's interception
of a ship boarded with Diaoyu Island defenders from Hong Kong and
Taiwan, warning that "the Japanese side should be held responsible
for the consequences arising therefrom".
</P>
<P>
Tang made these remarks in response to a question concerning
the issue at today's routine news conference. It is reported that
a ship named "Diaoyutai" with some people from Hong Kong and
Taiwan to defend the Diaoyu Islands was hit by a Japanese warship
yesterday.

<P>
"The Diaoyu Island and its adjacent islands have been China's
inherent territory since ancient times, and this position of the

</P>
<P>
With regard to the recent actions of Hong Kong and Taiwan
people to defend the islands, Tang said, the Chinese side has,
through diplomatic channels, expounded China's position to the
Japanese side, and strongly demanded that the Japanese side draw
lessons from the past, refrain from taking stern acts or moves,
and refrain from intensifying conflicts.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Japanese side has sent many military
vessels to intercept and even hit the ship which was damaged.

<HEADLINE> Australians Among Healthiest People in World: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Australians were among the
healthiest people in the world but they were becoming alarmingly
fatter than they were two decades ago, a new report said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's
sixth biennial report, the fact that Australian were among the
healthiest people was shown by increasing life expectancy, a low
rate of life-threatening infectious diseases and ready access to
health care for most people.
</P>
<P>
Australia ranks eighth in the world behind Iceland, Hong Kong,
Japan, Sweden, Israel, Greece and Switzerland in those regards but
ahead of Canada, the United States, Russia, New Zealand, Germany
and Italy.
</P>
<P>
An Australian boy born in 1996 could expect to live 75.4 years
and a girl 81.1 years, the report found.
</P>
<P>
Average spending on health services per person in Australia
increased by 74 Australian dollars to 2,345 Australian dollars
(about 1,407 U.S. dollars ) in the fiscal year 1996-1997.
</P>
<P>
It found Australians were becoming much fatter than they were
20 years ago despite stronger messages of fitness and low-fat
eating.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of overweight or obese women aged between 25 and
64 increased from 27 percent in 1980 to 46 percent in 1995, and
from 47 percent to 66 percent for men over the same period.
</P>
<P>
On average, men in 1995 weighed 3.6 kg more than their
counterparts in 1980 while women were 4.8 kg heavier.
</P>
<P>
The report also found health levels among 300,000 indigenous
Australians were still poor.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, life expectancy among indigenous
people was up to 20 years lower than that for other Australians
totaling 17.7 million, and their death rates were three times
higher, infant mortality up to four times higher and the
hospitalization rate 50 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Stock Market Continues to Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore stock market closed
weaker Thursday as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index
(STII) fell by 5.02 points to close at 1,069.83.
</P>
<P>
The share prices were weaker and the volume was thin as market
sentiment remained gloomy over Asia's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said investors were still worried about the persisting
weakness in the region's currencies.
</P>
<P>
Many remained dominated by the skepticism over recovery in the
economy as they did not see any sign of an upward trend. Property
stocks managed to inch higher, encouraged by hopes that benefit
will be reaped from the off-budget measures which were said to be
announced by the government next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Total volume shrank to 87.52 million shares, valued at 199.80
million Singapore dollars (121.09 million U.S. dollars). Declines
led advances by 142 to 116 while 330 stocks remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The most active stock was EasyKnit thk, a favorite of retail
players, which ended with a volume of 8.51 million shares traded.
The volume of Ho Pro u98 was 4.97 million units. DBS Land was next
with 4.68 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50 remained the top gainer of the day as it increased
by 70 cents to close at 22.00 Singapore dollars. Asean finished 30
cents up to 5.40 U.S. dollars. Rothmans increased by 30 cents to
end at 11.50 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, SPH was the biggest loser as it lost 40 cents
to finish at 11.80 Singapore dollars. Thai Pr ended 33 cents down
to 2.83 U.S. dollars. DBS shed 30 cents to close at 6.50 Singapore
dollars.

<P>
ANKARA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
left for Moldova Thursday for a two-day official visit during
which documents of cooperation will be signed.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for the visit to Moldova, Demirel said at
the Ankara Esenboga Airport that he will see the developments in
the political, economic and social fields following the
independence of Moldova in 1991 and provide more support for the
stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the press office of the presidential
palace said Wednesday that an agreement on the prevention of dual
taxation and a protocol on medical cooperation are expected to be
signed during Demirel's visit.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in the field of education is also of importance
between Turkey and Moldova, said the statement.

<HEADLINE> US to Cooperate With Uganda in Investigating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kampala, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. security has agreed to
share information with their Ugandan counterparts in the
investigation of the Kampala mayor's case, Director of Uganda's
Crimainal Investigation Department, Chris Bakiza, has said.
</P>
<P>
Chris Bakiza said Wednesday that Interpol Chiefs in Washington
D.C., the U.S., told the Uganda security authorities that more
Ugandans would be under probe over the forged checks of the
arrested Kampala mayor Nasser Sabaggala, the New Vision quoted
Bakiza as reporting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Top Ugandan officers will leave for the United States soon to
cooperate in the investigation of the case of Sabaggala, who was
arrested on June 13 in New York for making false Customs
declaration statements and forged checks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bakiza said Interpol Uganda has a long list of Ugandans who
had been dealing in this illicit transaction between Kampala and
Boston.
</P>
<P>
Charges against the mayor dated back to February 4, 1997 when
he allegedly deposited an altered check of 39,000 U.S. dollars
into his account in Bank Boston.
</P>
<P>
He is also charged of depositing another altered check for
99,000 dollars on the same account five days later.
</P>
<P>
Chances of the mayor's return to homeland now look bleak
because the Ugandan government is reported to have said that it
is not in a position to guarantee Sebaggala's bail to the U.S.
court.
</P>
<P>
The mayor has another wife in Boston who is reponsible for
making the transactions for him but did not mention her identity
and nationality, said the report.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the mayor will face a prison term of more than
30 years and a fine of more than one million dollars,
according to the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
clawed back earlier losses to finish just marginally negative
Thursday despite a solid rise on Wall Street overnight.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index closed 0.8 points easier at
2,592.0, while Asian markets firmed and the Dow Jones Industrial
Average jumped 95.41 points to 8,923.87.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the local bourse would have been off around 20
points if not for gains among market heavyweights News Corp. and
Telstra and if AMP had been factored into the equation.
</P>
<P>
"We opened a few points better initially but as the yen and the
Australian dollar weakened a little, our market did the same,"
Reynolds &AMP; Co.'s Peter Struk said.
</P>
<P>
"I thought we would have followed Tokyo and Hong Kong up today
but we couldn't even manage that, so it's been a very
disappointing day in virtually all stocks," he added.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index rose 9.9 points to 4,529.3 and the
resources sector dropped 11.2 points to 1,032.1.
</P>
<P>
Media giant News Corp. was higher on reports that U.S. phone
giant AT&AMP;T had finalized a 46.8 billion U.S. dollars bid for U.S.
cable concern Tele-Communications Ltd., a massive premium to TCI's
previous market valuation.
</P>
<P>
Among other industrials, retail giant Coles Myer tumbled 23
cents to 6.33 Australian dollars. Fellow retail stock Woolworths
gained four cents. Qantas dipped 11 cents and Lend Lease lost 49.4
cents.
</P>
<P>
The gold index forfeited 7.7 points to 1,043.5 as the precious
metal was trading 85 cents an ounce lower at 292.50 U.S. dollars.
</P>

The banking index dropped 19.3 points to 5,631.5, as NAB
dropped 49.7 cents, ANZ gained 15 cents, CBA improved 2.6 cents

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Down But Well Off Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar slipped
briefly under the 60 U.S. cent mark Thursday but scrambled back
after buying in Japan to close above the key psychological level.
</P>
<P>
Despite holding up reasonably well, the local currency ended
lower at 60.43 U.S. cents, from 60.89 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar has come back a bit from 60 U.S. cents
after some good sized buying out of Japan," Macquarie Bank foreign
exchange manager Mark O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
The local currency traded between its low of 59.95 and 60.57
U.S. cents on the day.
</P>
<P>
"I think the market has been short a little bit and I think
people are concerned there could be a sell off in the U.S. dollar
against the Japanese yen," O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the Australian dollar received a little support
from its neighbor, New Zealand, on the release of their better
than expected current account deficit figure.
</P>
<P>
Fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch, Bartholomew Dowling,
said support for the Australian dollar Thursday had reduced the
perceived likelihood of a hike in official interest rates by the
Reserve Bank of Australia.
</P>
<P>
A break of the key 140 threshold in the yen to the U.S. dollar
Thursday was not accompanied by a drastic fall in the Australian
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Dowling said the Australian dollar was not out of the woods yet
and Merrill Lynch expected the currency to continue to grind
lower.
</P>
<P>
In the foreign exchange market, the Australian dollar was
buying 85.11 Japanese yen from 85.47, and 1.0852 German marks from
1.0969.

<HEADLINE> Robbers Attack Aircraft at Lagos Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The shoot-at-sight order at the
international airport in Lagos failed to strengthen security
there as robbers attacked an Air Afrique aircraft which was set
for take-off Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports Thursday, the armed hoodlums, in a
10-minute operation at about 9 p.m., broke into the luggage
compartment of the Boeing 727 aircraft and carted away a large
quantity of luggage.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, bound for New York via Abidjan, was then waiting
in darkness at the instruction from the control tower to make way
for an incoming flight already on the taxi-way.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian reported that the only armed sucurity escort
vehicle for aircraft for the night had goen to service the
arriving flight and was not able to prevent the robbery when
distress call came from the tower following the pilot's request
for assistance.
</P>
<P>
The robbers escaped, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Barely one month ago, when a Cameroon Airlines Boeing 737
which landed at the same airport was relieving of its luggage
while on the runway, a sizable portion of the luggage was
removed, and the hoodlums also escaped.
</P>
<P>
The latest victim of security lapses at the airport is the
federal government project to update navigational aids at 18
airports across the country.
</P>
<P>
Last week, hoodlums exploited the porous security network at
the Lagos airport and vandalized one of the first two sets of
Instrument Landing System.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) then has
ordered a shoot-at-sight of anyone found illegally tampering with
facilities at the airports, especially at night.
</P>
<P>
According reports, increased spate of vandalization and theft
of equipment began with the retrenchment of about 3,000 personnel
of the airport management authority in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, IRRI Discuss New Frontiers of Rice Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 25 (Xinhua) -- With the world's population
expanding and arable land shrinking, rice producing countries
including Thailand need to develop new technologies to improve
yields, a seminar held here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting between Thailand and the International Rice
Research Institute (IRRI) was inaugurated here Thursday, which
focuses mainly on new frontiers in developing the rice industry.
</P>
<P>
Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn of Thailand attended the
opening ceremony, during which she spoke about the efforts made by
her father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in promoting the research of
rice planting by establishing academies and developing royal
experimental plots.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Fischer, deputy director general of IRRI, said the
world must produce 40 percent more rice to feed the increased
population in the next decade when there are less land with less
water.
</P>
<P>
This requires rice producing countries, including Thailand, to
develop new and better rice varieties, improve irrigation systems,
safeguard the free movement of germplasm, adapt biotechnologies
and enhance the efficiency of production, he said.
</P>
<P>
For Thailand, the specific challenges are to increase yields to
meet the demand while maintaining the good grain quality widely
accepted in the world market; adapt appropriate agricultural
mechanization; increase farmers' income; and develop the
technologies that could withstand floods and drought, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, the world's largest rice exporter, has about 60
million rai (9.6 million hectares) of arable land with an average
300-400 kilogram productivity per rai (0.16 hectares).
</P>
<P>
Currently, the country is conducting more than 40 collaborative
projects with IRRI in deepwater rice, rainfed lowland rice, upland
rice, pest management and other fields.
</P>
<P>
IRRI is an autonomous, nonprofit international agricultural
research and training center based in the Philippines, which
carries out rice and rice-related research.

conform to the party's and government's foreign policy, safeguard

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Major Opposition Joins Budget Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's major opposition the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) joined the budget session of
the Jatiya Sangsad, the country's parliament, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the BNP to attend parliament
proceedings since early May.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Speaker Abdul Hamid, who chaired the proceedings,
welcomed BNP parliamentary members for joining the current
session, the ninth session of the seventh parliament.
</P>
<P>
"I have already told you that we will join the budget session,"
Begum Khaleda Zia, BNP chairperson and opposition leader in
parliament, told reporters Wednesday after a meeting of the BNP
Parliamentary Party.
</P>
<P>
Her party would play its role in parliament and at the same
time build a movement on the street against the government, Chief
Whip of the Opposition Khondadar Delwar Hossain quoted Zia as
saying at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The session on the budget for the 1998-99 fiscal year beginning
July 1 started on June 10 without participation of BNP MPs, who
walked out on May 3 of the eighth session of parliament when three
hill district council bills designed to give legal effect to the
Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) peace treaty were taken up for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the Speaker of failing to maintain "neutrality" and
protesting "limited discussion" on the CHT bills, the BNP MPs
walked out of the parliament session which began on January 14 and
ended on May 6 after approving four bills paving the way to
implementing the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The peace treaty, aimed at ending armed conflict in the hill
tracts, was concluded between the government and the tribal
guerrillas in December last year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Production Estimated to Drop 6 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rice production this
year is projected to decline by 6 percent to 46 million tons
compared with last year, Agriculture Ministry's director general
for food crops and horticulture Chairil Anwar Rasahan said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said Last year's production of unhusked rice was recorded
at about 49.3 million tons so that with the decrease of about 6
percent, this year's production of unhusked rice was estimated to
reach about 46 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The decline was to be attributed to a protracted drought and
pest attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
This has revived an earlier ministerial statement that the
decline of rice production would be 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report from the Central Bureau of Statistics,
Agriculture Minister Soleh Solahuddin said recently that
Indonesia's unhusked rice production was expected to reach 46.17
million tons this year, 6.3 percent down from last year.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said in order to encourage farmers to boost their rice
production, the Agriculture Ministry was trying to make it easier
for them to obtain bank loans.

<HEADLINE> Economists Predict Negative Growth in S'pore Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Two Singapore economists
Thursday predicted that the economy in their city-state will dip
into recession in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Chen Kang and Dr. Tan Khee Glap from the Nanyang Technology
University told a workshop at the university Thursday morning that
the economy will contract by 1.7 percent in GDP this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure will be lower than the 1.6 percent of slump in 1985
when Singapore weathered an economic recession, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The drop will sustain through the remaining quarters of this
year and the manufacturing industry as well as financial and
business services would see sharp falls in the second half of the
year, they added.
</P>
<P>
However, the economy should pick up mildly after the first
quarter of next year and a 3.2 percent growth will be seen for the
full year of 1999, they said.
</P>
<P>
The two economists attributed the predicted recession to the
cyclical slowdown in global electronics, the political uncertainty
of Indonesia and the weakening Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's economic growth has slowed down this year but their
prediction is gloomier than the forecast by the government.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Information and the Arts and Second Minister for
Trade and Industry George Yeo told the Business Week Asia
Leadership Forum Tuesday that "the expected growth rate for this
year will have to be revised downwards although it is still not
likely to be negative".
</P>
<P>
On June 29, the government will announce in the Parliament its
off-budget measures to boost the slowdown economy.
</P>
<P>
But commentators said the much anticipated off-budget measures,
aimed at reducing business costs and helping companies cope with
the difficult time, can give little stimulus to the economy.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Launches Action Plan on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
officially launched a national plan of action on human rights
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The action plan "constitutes a concrete contribution to the
endeavor to bring about a new international order predicated upon
justice, social welfare and equality," he said.
</P>
<P>
It also provides clear and concrete guidelines on high priority
issues and a timetable for its implementation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The society, including the international community, can
readily know and follow the implementation of various human rights
programs as scheduled," Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has decided to accelerate the ratification of and
accession to various United Nations human rights instruments in
accordance with the spirit of reforms in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a member of the United Nations, we have to respect and
abide by the human rights norms recognized by the international
community," Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
In implementing the action plan, he said, Indonesia will always
welcome any assistance and cooperation so long as they are
mutually beneficial, based on mutual respect, and without any
conditionality.
</P>
<P>
"I thank all the friendly governments which have extended such
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas in his report said
Indonesia is committed to the promotion and protection of the
human rights and fundamental freedoms of all the Indonesian people
regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, language, religion or
political persuasion.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the action plan, Alatas said that the substance of
the plan is borne by four pillars: first, the ratification of
international human rights instruments; second, the dissemination
of information and the conduct of social education on human
rights; third, measures to address human rights issues determined
as national priorities; and fourth, the implementation of ratified
international human rights conventions.
</P>
<P>
Priority issues in human rights implementation will include the
right to life, arbitrary detention, prevention of torture, fair
trial and poverty alleviation, Alatas said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Farmers Complain of Too Many Levies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia National Farmers Union
(ZNFU) has complained that rural councils are imposing various
levies on small-scale farmers and there are several
irregularities in the system.
</P>
<P>
The process is worrisome because the councils are implementing
the levies without adequate consultations with the farming
community, Thursday's Zambia Daily Mail quoted ZNFU President
Ajay Vashee as saying in a statement on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vashee said that the councils have continued to deduct from
the final purchase farmers receive from buyers, which is not
supposed to be the case.
</P>
<P>
"It must be recognized that uncontrolled and arbitrary levies
are a tax burden on the productive sector. Most council by-laws
require growers to pay such levies, invariably even when this is
not the case, it is being deducted from the final purchase," he
said.
</P>
<P>
This is unacceptable and the union feels that the opposition
to these council levies on small-scale farmers is perfectly
justified under the present circumstances, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vashee called for a common fixed percentage which will be
applied by all councils that might require to use it.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman On Diaoyu Island Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang today expressed China's concern over Japan's interception
of a ship boarded with Diaoyu Island defenders from Hong Kong and
Macao, warning that "the Japanese side should be held responsible
for the consequences arising therefrom".
</P>
<P>
Tang made these remarks in response to a question concerning
the issue at today's routine news conference. It is reported that
a ship named "Diaoyutai" with some people from Hong Kong and Macao
to defend the Diaoyu Island was hit by a Japanese warship and sank
 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"The Diaoyu Island and its adjacent islands have been China's
inherent territory since ancient times, and this position of the
Chinese government is clear and consistent," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the recent actions of Hong Kong and Macao people
to defend the islands, Tang said, the Chinese side has, through
diplomatic channels, expounded China's position to the Japanese
side, and strongly demanded that the Japanese side draw lessons
from the past, refrain from taking stern acts or moves, and
refrain from intensifying conflicts.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Japanese side has sent many military
vessels to intercept the ship and even hit the ship which was
severely damaged and finally sank.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Seeking for Alternative Transport Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is searching for a
locally-produced alternative transport fuel that will reduce
harmful emissions and save foreign exchange for the country.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government is considering the production of
ethanol from sugar cane that will be blended with gasoline to
produce a low pollution-level fuel, the Zambia Daily Maily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A study report released Wednesday at a renewable energy
projects seminar in Lusaka said that the alternative fuel is
expected to decrease urban air pollution and salvage the
depleting ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seminar sponsored by the ministry of energy
and water development, Deputy Minister Celestino Chibamba prodded
the coutnry's experts involved in making the fuel a reality to
finish the study before the stated time of 12 months after which
a final draft will be put to the government for implementation.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that there will be a more practical approach to the
project than paper work.
</P>
<P>
Apart from being environmentally friendly, the new fuel
produced from sugar cane and gasoline is expected to stimulate
the development of new domestic resources and promote the
nation's renewable energy resources, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Rest Key Players Against Tunisia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAINT-DENIS, June 25 (xinhua) -- Romania will rest their key
players in Friday's match against Tunisia as they have already
qualified for the second round.
</P>
<P>
That means those who have minor fitness troubles could have the
chance to nurse their injuries before the crucial match against either
Argentina or Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Those who play the match against Tunisia would also be relaxed
and avoid getting any more cards.
</P>
<P>
Five Romanians are carrying a yellow card. Another booking
would mean an automatic ban from the top of 16 match.
</P>
<P>
Though Romania need just one point to be sure of coming top in
the group, coach Anghel Iordansecu vowed to beat Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that he had some problems in selecting the
starters:"We have a few injuries and some problems with yellow
cards, and that complicates selection." said Iordansecu.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia will pose no great threat to the Romanian team as they
are now at the bottom of the group and will play the match without
their coach Henri Kasperczak who had been fired after Monday's 1-0
defeat against Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Operations Help Children with Cleft Palate Restore Smiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- With the help of charity surgery,
hundreds of Chinese children with cleft palates may finally speak
and smile like normal kids.
</P>
<P>
The operations, scheduled for early August in Beijing, will be
jointly performed by foreign and Chinese plastic surgeons under
the support of "Operation Smile International," an international
non-profit volunteer organization.
</P>
<P>
About 200 children born with the genetic deformity will be
given the operation free of charge. But more than 600 patients
across the country have applied for the opportunity so far,
according to the Beijing-based Operation Smile China (OSC).
</P>
<P>
Cleft palate is a common facial deformity that does not allow a
child to talk and smile normally. About 36,000 babies out of 20
million born in China each year are afflicted, according to a
national epidemiological research.
</P>
<P>
"Plastic surgery to treat cleft palate costs about 5,000 yuan
(600 U.S. dollars), which is not affordable for a poor family in
China," said Xue Bing, a staff worker of OSC.
</P>
<P>
Operation Smile International has offered the operations to
more than 40,000 children in 18 countries and regions since it was
established by U.S. surgeons in 1982.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,000 Chinese children have been among the
beneficiaries since the organization started work in China in
1992, Xue said.
</P>
<P>
The organization plans to expand its service in various ways,
such as sending medics and facilities to some remote villages,
establishing service centers in different parts of the country and
training local medics, he said.

JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Pressure on banks to raise
their lending rates eased further Wednesday after the repo rate
fell another 1.7 percentage points, prompting Standard Bank to
cut its prime lending rate, the daily Business Day reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The repo rate, the market-set rate at which the Central Bank
lends to commercial banks, stood at 18.71 percent from 20.45
percent on Tuesday and 23.985 percent on Monday.

<P>
Standard Bank, which raised its prime lending rate by three
percentage points against two percentage points by other banks,
Thursday cut its rate by one percentage point to 20.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lower repo rate and a stronger Rand inspired a 2.5 percent
gain on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's all share index to a

HOHHOT, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A tribal site believed to be
4,500-to-6,000 years old surrounded by a trench has been found in
Qingshuihe County in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The site, covering an area of 40,000 square meters and located
1,580 meters above sea level, is among the largest neolithic sites
ever found in the region, according to Chinese archeologists.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the site is 70 meters above the nearby Yellow
River, which made it a safe place for living in the ancient time.
</P>
<P>
With three gates opened to the east, northeast and southwest of
the site, the inner part features groups of buildings that were
built in a certain order. The largest building, half underground,
was built in the center. Around it were a group of medium-size
buildings. The outer circle was composed of small buildings.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists regard the largest building as a place for public
gatherings and the site occupied by a major tribe in the region.
</P>
<P>
To date, archeologists have excavated more than 20 buildings,
40 rubbish pits, four tombs and part of the trench, unearthing
pottery, stones, bones and shellware, and animal bones.

<HEADLINE> IMF's Strategy Damages Malaysian Economy: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday that the International Monetary
Fund's strategy on interest rates which Malaysia adopted has
damaged its economy.
</P>
<P>
Initially, it was thought that the IMF's strategy was very
good, Mahathir said, adding that "We adopted the strategy only to
find out that it has damaged our economy."
</P>
<P>
"But going back is very difficult. As such, we have to figure
out how to manage the economy after the damage has been done
through shortening the period for non-performing loans, credit
squeeze and hike in interest rates," he told a news conference
after opening the five-day SMI Showcase '98 here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To a question if interest rates would come down to more
acceptable levels, Mahathir said: "We are trying to figure out,
but unfortunately our interest rates are affected by interest
rates on ringgit loans."
</P>
<P>
"There is a tendency for our ringgit to go out of the country.
This has deprived banks of funds and that is very damaging to us,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Government economic adviser Daim Zainuddin, who was appointed
as minister of special functions in the Prime Minister's
Department Wednesday, has been advocating lower interest rates to
revive the country's economy which has been affected by the
regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Credit interest rates in Malaysia are now above 15 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Rules Out Use of Force on Squatters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
has ruled out the use of force on the villagers who illegally
moved onto four commercial farms.
</P>
<P>
The president said Wednesday that the Zimbabwean government
will not use force to move the Svosve villagers in east Zimbabwe
who have illegally moved onto four commercial farms and have
ignored appeals by the government to return home.
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials failed to
convince the hundreds of land-hungry villagers to go back home
and await legal resettlement by the government, the daily Herald
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The villagers are now demanding a written undertaking from the
government promising them that they will be resettled on the
farms they have invaded.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Herald Wednesday, Mugabe said while
the government would want the Svosve people to move off the
commercial farms, there was no way that force would be used to
drive them back to their homes.
</P>
<P>
"Why should we use tear gas? Why should we use force on our
people who are hungry for land? The matter before us is not one
about acquisition," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said that the villagers have very genuine reasons to
demand resettlement but they should wait to be "methodically"
resettled.
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no. We are not going to use guns on our people. Why
should we do that? Why should we be heavy-handed as has been
suggested?" he said, apparently referring to the commentary by a
business analyst who said the government should act "decisively"
and not handle the Svosve villagers issue with kid gloves.
</P>
<P>
The analyst said that the Svosve issue had far-reaching
ramifications, including dampening investor confidence. He also
expressed fear that if the government is not tough enough on the
villagers, other villagers elsewhere would also illegally
resettle themselves.
</P>
<P>
The villagers of the Svosve descent a week ago invaded four
farms near their homes, saying that they had run out of patience
and accused the government of not acting speedily on its planned
resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
President Mugabe said that he would be following closely the
developments on the four farms.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-eight percent of
American parents are concerned about their children being exposed
to potentially harmful material on the Internet, ranging from
pornography to manipulative E-mail from direct marketers, said a
study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, based on a consumer survey and conducted by research
firm NFO Interactive, indicates that parents also are wary of
their children interacting with strangers in chat rooms on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a high percentage of parents are taking active
measures to limit what their children do online: sixty-six percent
of them do not allow their children to give out personal
information; about 62 percent prohibit online shopping; and 54
percent take steps to prevent children from accessing adult
entertainment sites, according to the study, which was released at
a conference in San Francisco on children's online issues.
</P>
<P>
Another study released at the conference ranked children's most
common activities on the Net: E-mail topped the ranks, followed by
chat, general Web surfing, homework and games.
</P>
<P>
The top two most accessed services on the Internet -- E-mail

<HEADLINE> Arable Land of China Dwindling at Alarming Rate, Survey Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- China's already inadequate supply
of arable land is dwindling at an alarming rate, due to
uncontrolled consumption, according to a national survey.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1996, 2.02 million hectares of land was
used for non-agricultural construction, exceeding the state's
land-use plan by 28 percent. Of the hectares used, more than half
was arable land, exceeding the plan by 18.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that, from a geographic point of view,
the 12 coastal provinces and municipalities accounted for 53
percent of the total used area and 57 percent of the arable land
used.
</P>
<P>
Structural imbalances posed another problem, as the survey
indicated excessive land was used for real estate, development
zones and golf courses. The development zones alone accounted for
30 percent of China's idle land.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the vegetation on 55 percent of the idle
arable land was destroyed, making it difficult to be reused for
growing purposes.
</P>
<P>
In the coastal regions of east and south China, the idle land
accounted for 84 percent of the country's total, and the idle
arable land was 82 percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were killed
and four others wounded early Thursday morning in south Lebanon in
a roadside bombing attack, the Voice of the People Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred near an Israeli post at Mishgura, near
Houla which is about 50 kilometers southeast of Sidon, provincial
capital of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah said that one of its units detonated the first
roadside bomb targetting a group of "Israeli enemies" and another
one 15 minutes later when Israeli reinforcements arrived at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
It also said that after the blasts, Hezbollah fighters had
temporary exchange of fire with Israeli troops from close
distance. No Hezbollah casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
Following the gun battle, Israeli helicopters were dispatched
to area to evacuate the soldiers. In retaliation, Israeli troops
heavily shelled surrounding villages and destroyed several
civilians' houses.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon since 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its
northern areas from Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting a tough guerrilla war with
the 2,000-strong Israeli occupying forces.

The accounting books always reflect a company's operation. But,
at present, some illegal activities, such as making fake
accounting books or not maintaining any accounting books at all,
have cast a shadow on the fairness of market competition and even

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firms Doing Well in China, Survey Shows (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in the early period of China's reform and opening-up
drive, the number of U.S. companies investing in China was the
highest among overseas investors after Hong Kong, and U.S.
businesses led investment in many sectors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies, unlike other foreign investors, also
participated in energy development in China, which involved many
uncertain factors, higher risks and requires significant funding.
</P>
<P>
With advanced technology and a focus on local technology, quite
a number of U.S. trans-national businesses established research
centers in China, which have pressed ahead the technology transfer
to the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey indicated, U.S. investment in China is
still much less than its input in other Asian countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, paid-in U.S. investment in China
reached approximately 17.5 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for
only 2 percent of its total overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. businesses failed in their China ventures or fell
into dire straits because they underestimated the difficulties and
risks brought about by intense competition in the Chinese market,
or they adopted improper strategies.
</P>
<P>
The survey concluded that, with the establishment of a
Sino-U.S. constructive strategic partnership, cooperation between
the business circles of the two countries will be strengthened
and there are still wider prospects for U.S. investment in China.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firms Doing Well in China, Survey Shows (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
three-fourths of the well-known U.S. businesses in China are
operating well and have begun to profit from their investment,
especially those with investment in China's high-tech, information
industry.
</P>
<P>
Most of U.S. companies are optimistic about their future in
China, according to the survey, which was conducted by a group led
by Wang Zhile, professor of the Academy of International Trade and
Economic Cooperation under the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The group visited more than 50 Sino-U.S. joint ventures in
Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Shenzhen and
Guangzhou, as well as Hong Kong, and held discussions with over
170 managers, including 70 foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the large-scale and wide-ranging U.S.
investment with advanced technology and management in China has
played a positive role in the country's economic growth and
improvement of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
But there are still difficulties and problems for the U.S.
enterprises in China while they are making profits, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one of the top 30 U.S. companies honored in 1997 by
Fortune, a U.S. magazine, have funded 175 projects in China, while
the nine others, mainly service and tobacco companies, did not
follow suit because of China's restrictions on these sectors,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Wang went on to say that the U.S. investors have so far focused
on the region along the rim of the Bohai Bay in north China and
the Yangtze River Delta in east China, leaving an extremely large
investment potential in central and west China.

<HEADLINE> APEC Should Adopt Smart Partnership Approach:Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum should adopt a smart partnership approach
in developing cross-border linkages so that APEC markets will
benefit all members, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
By smart partnership, each one must contribute something --
land and location, labor, capital, common technology, management
and raw material, and in return, receive a fair share, Mahathir
told the opening of a seminar here.
</P>
<P>
He said that within APEC, which is dedicated to economic
cooperation, Malaysia will continue to work on the three pillars
of cooperation already endorsed -- trade and investment
liberalization, trade and investment facilitation, and economic
and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"These are virtuous words but they must be translated into
virtuous deeds. All sides should gain from the liberalization,
facilitation and cooperation," he said, adding that if the gains
are only one-sided or worse still and if they cause damage to any
partner, then the deeds should be re-examined with the view to
correct its manner of implementation.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the competition between small- and medium-scale
industries (SMIs) or the developed and developing members of APEC,
each should be allowed to retain its competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
The low-cost labor of the lesser developed members should not
be regarded as unfair advantage, he said, adding that if it is,
then capital, technology and management know-how of developed
members must also be regarded as unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
"If we are not agreeable to retaining the competitive
advantages of each group, then we should do away with both. It is
not fair to expect one competitive advantage to be eliminated
while the other is retained. Experience has shown that when one
competitive advantage is combined with the others, the greatest
cost benefit will result," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the process of the transfer of technology,
skills must take place and "Everyone should be enriched due to the
linkage and the transfer."
</P>
<P>
He said capital, management and technology should cross borders
in order to contribute towards the development of technology in
lesser developed members through SMIs.
</P>
<P>
"In the electronics, telecommunications and information
technology (IT) industry, the scope for SMIs is considerable,"
Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said that since computer clones were permissible, other
products too should be allowed for similar cloning and in this
way, benefits from research in the electronics, telecommunications
and IT industry suitable for SMIs will be better spread to benefit
the most number of people.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft kicks off Windows 98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., the world's
Largest software-maker, officially kicked off Windows 98 at a
waterfront bash in San Francisco on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the celebration of Windows 95 three years ago,
Thursday's get-together is fairly low-key celebration, according to
sources familiar with both events.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts believe that the more modest Window 98 coming-out
merely reflects that Windows 98 is not dramatic change like Windows
95, which improved the basic "look and feel" of computing and
encouraged Apple Macintosh users to switch in drives to Windows
machines.
</P>
<P>
Windows 98's main improvement, they pointed out, is that it
weaves Microsoft's Internet browser into the desktop operating
system, turning the computer screen into a viewfinder for both the
World Wide Web and information stored in a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
Trying to reproduce some of the hype that launched Microsoft's
Windows 95, which sold millions of copies within the first few weeks,
some U.S. merchants were staying open late Wednesday or opening their
doors very early Thursday to promote sales of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Windows 98 will quickly become the standard
operating system for new personal computers.
</P>
<P>
Windows 98 requires a minimum of a 486-class computer with 16
megabytes of random access memory and 195 megabytes of free hard disk
space for the typical installation, compared with 120 megabytes for
Windows 95.

<HEADLINE> ADB Assists Sri Lanka's Coast Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A special technical team from the
Asian Development Bank will be in Sri Lanka to assist the Coast
Conservation Department (CCD) in preparing a project on the
management and protection of the coastal ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
One million U.S. dollars have already been allocated for the
project, CCD manager R.A.D.B. Samaranayake said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said coastal erosion in Sri Lanka is increasing rapidly and
there is an urgent need to arrest it.
</P>
<P>
There is an average 300-millimeter erosion rate per year along
the country's 1,600 kilometer coastal line. In some areas the
erosion rate is higher at 3,000 millimeters per year.
</P>
<P>
The project is necessary because coastal erosion and
degradation pose a threat not only to man and the environment but
also to the coastal ecosystem, Samaranayake said.
</P>
<P>
Coastal erosion and degradation also lead to the destruction
and loss of communication facilities such as roads and railways,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Another more serious problem is the possible intrusion of the
sea across the narrow barrier which separates the low-lying
backwaters and marshy areas from the sea, the manager added.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Red-bean Fir for Cancer Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese biologists have recently
made it possible to cultivate the red-bean fir on a large scale,
which is good news for cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
Chengdu Biological Research Institute under the Chinese Academy
of Sciences has set up a 66-hectare red-bean fir cultivation base,
the country's largest, in Maoxian County, Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The institute, in cooperation with the provincial Tumor
Research Institute, has also invented a new type of
cancer-resistant injection using yew alcohol extracted from
red-bean fir saplings.
</P>
<P>
Clinical practices show that medicines containing yew alcohol
have reported 20-to-30 percent effectiveness for cancer patients,
compared with 10 percent using other pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
Wild red-bean fir resources were near extinction in China due
to human destruction, but artificial cultivation offers broad
prospects for its use, biologists said.
</P>
<P>
The institute began its cultivation research in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Thai Academics Call For Debt Moratorium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A group of influential academics
in Thailand Thursday called for a debt moratorium to give ailing
businesses more room to breathe.
</P>
<P>
The Chulalongkorn University, the most prestigious institute in
Thailand, is canvassing support for the call, said Narong
Petchprasert, a lecturer at the university.
</P>
<P>
He said he and other lecturers from the Economics Faculty had
got together under a "Bundit Thai" (Thai Graduates) group to push
for the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
The group asked people who favor the move to sign a petition to
be submitted to the government when the Parliament convenes later
this month to deliberate the budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Narong criticized the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its
rescue operations which he said have proved to be "a failure."
</P>
<P>
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda has rejected the
suggestion of a moratorium put forward by university academics.
Thailand's foreign debts currently stand at 86 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Narong said Tarrin preferred to steer clear of the issue,
making it known that he does not want to think about it.
</P>
<P>
A temporary suspension of debt payments would give the economy
a much needed reprieve, Narong said.
</P>
<P>
If the moratorium idea were endorsed, the government and the
IMF must negotiate the private debts with creditors on behalf of
individual businesses.
</P>
<P>
During an earlier academic discussion entitled "How Will
Thailand Survive?" many university lecturers resolved to press the
government for the implementation of the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
Krirkchai Charoenratchapak, rector of Rajabhat Institute, said
the suspension should last between one and two years to boost
domestic liquidity. The action would sustain the cash flow,
leaving at least 17.6 billion baht (440 million dollars) in the
country's circulation.
</P>
<P>
Such suspension would provide a chance to strengthen Thailand's
financial position and help rebuild firms which were on the verge
of bankruptcy, Krirkchai said.
</P>
<P>
The survival of the businesses would translate into jobs which
in turn would tackle unemployment and other social problems, while
the people would have greater purchasing power to increase
domestic consumption and help resolve the stagnant liquidity,
Krirkchai said.
</P>
<P>
"Declare the moratorium while there's still some blood left in
the system. It is better to do something now than wait until the
businesses collapse. Then there will be no money to pay off
debts," he warned.

<HEADLINE> American Parents Worry About Net Safety for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 24 (Xinhua) -- More than half the American
parents with Web-surfing children are willing to pay for services
that police Internet content and chat rooms for material, a new
study shows.
</P>
<P>
The study, based on a consumer survey, was conducted by the
research firm, NFO Interactive, and announced Tuesday at a
conference in San Francisco on children's online issues.
</P>
<P>
The results reflect the heightened fear among parents over what
their children are doing on the Internet, and what material they
are receiving by email.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight percent of parents are concerned about their
children being exposed to potentially harmful material on the
Internet, ranging from pornography to manipulative email from
direct marketers.
</P>
<P>
Parents also are wary of their children interacting with
strangers in chat rooms, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Also, a high percentage of parents are taking active measures
to limit what their children do online. The study shows 66
percent of them do not allow their children to give out personal
information; about 62 percent prohibit online shopping; and 54
percent take steps to prevent children from accessing adult
entertainment sites.
</P>
<P>
Reported at the conference was another study which ranked
children's most common activities on the Net. Email topped the
ranks, followed by general Web surfing, homework, games and chat.
The top two most accessed services on the Internet -- email and
chat -- were also the two greatest concerns among parents.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the conference urged parents to demonstrate greater
awareness. "It's as much a parent's responsibility as to whether
or not they should let their kids watch violent films," one
speaker said.
</P>
<P>
They also urged both companies and parents to find common
ground. So far Net companies have continually maintained a vocal
stance for self-governance, and have been on the defensive about
government intervention into their online privacy practices.

(14.7 billion dollars) in fixed expenditure and 5.4 billion baht
(135 million dollars) for debt servicing. Chuan said the

<HEADLINE> Beijing University Prepares for Clinton's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The only restriction on the
audience attending U.S. President Bill Clinton's speech in Beijing
University (Beida) will be "the number of seats available," said a
vice president of the university here today at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Chi Huisheng, President Clinton is scheduled to
make a speech on June 29 in the auditorium with a seating capacity
of 800.
</P>
<P>
"I've noticed that when Chinese President Jiang Zemin made a
speech in U.S. Harvard University, the attendants were decided by
drawing lots," Chi said. In Clinton's case, the students will be
chosen by the same way, according to Chi. "Scholars on American
study will also attend," he added.
</P>
<P>
Students after the speech will raise questions and "It is up to
President Clinton to decide whoever will have the chance," he
said.
</P>
<P>
After the speech, Clinton will have a "free stroll" on the
campus with other members of the first family, Chi revealed.
</P>
<P>
Hillary Clinton, the first lady, and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, will hold discussions with lawyers and social
workers in Beida-sponsored Center for Women's Law Studies &AMP; Legal
Services.
</P>
<P>
Also, Clinton will attend a book-donation ceremony to Beida
Library. "I was told the books weigh about one ton, mostly on
American studies," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about his expectations of Clinton's
visit, Chi said that he hopes the tour will further promote the
Sino-U.S. educational exchanges. He considered Clinton's China
visit a "journey with visions," showing his willingness to enhance
the understanding on China through exchanges with young Chinese
students.
</P>
<P>
The current academic exchanges between Beida and other
institutions of higher learning in the United States are "active,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Beida has already formed regular inter-university exchanges
with 32 U.S. universities. 11 American companies have set up
scholarships in Beida.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Steps to Curb Moldovan Fiscal Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Moldova's severe financial
crisis has prompted the government to decide to take emergency
measures to reduce public expenditure and increase taxes, the
Moldovan Information Agency, Bassapres, reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ion Sturza, Moldavan deputy prime minister and the minister of
economy and reform, said the country has no ability to pay back
internal and external debts on time, or pay salaries and pensions
now.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with some Moldovan entrepreneurs Tuesday, Sturza
attributed the country's prevailing hardship to the huge losses
incurred in many enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the country's agricultural units and 50
percent of its industrial enterprises were heavily in debt or
capital deficit, he said.
</P>
<P>
The national economy was verging on suffocation because of the
existence of those enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that Moldova's external debt has reached 1.3
billion U.S. dollars, or more than 60 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP). The internal debt totals 212.7 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, owing to the lack of funds, few new projects were
explored in Moldova in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Sturza pointed out that under the present circumstances, the
government had no choice but to cut public expenditure
considerably and further increase taxes.
</P>
<P>
Anatol Arapu, minister of finance, was quoted as saying that
the government would hold a meeting at the weekend to study the
feasibility of abolishing several preferential policies on tax
abatements, imposing taxes on luxuries and imported fuel.

<HEADLINE> Poland, Romania to Brush Up Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile
said here Wednesday that his three-day visit to Poland will open a
new page in the history of Romania-Poland ties.
</P>
<P>
Vasile made the remark in Cracow at the conclusion of his first
trip abroad after he assumed premiership.
</P>
<P>
The visiting prime minister told reporters Monday, after
meeting his Polish counterpart, Jerzy Buzek, that he hoped his
visit would help raise the two countries' economic cooperation to
a level which was compatible with its potential.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two prime ministers stressed efforts to
promote democracy in Central and Eastern Europe and the principles
of the market economy, the Polish Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Buzek promised his country's support for Romania's bid to enter
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The Romanian side
expressed support for all the regional standpoints raised by
Poland.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also indicated their willingness to cooperate with
each other in their pursuit of membership in the European Union
(EU).
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the neighboring countries have failed to
secure an expected development in their economies and trade
cooperation. This year, however, has witnessed notable improvement.
</P>
<P>
The total trade volume between the two countries was 146.6
million U.S. dollars with Polish exports totaling 79.4 million
dollars and imports 67.2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter this year, Polish exports to Romania
reached 35.5 million dollars while imports rose to 21 million
dollars, a total 150 percent increase over the same period last
year.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Defers Sanctions on Angola's UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
adopted a resolution on Wednesday to postpone the date of imposing
sanctions on the Angolan government's rival faction UNITA, or the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola, until July 1.
</P>
<P>
The decision follows a letter to the council president by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan who accepted the recommendation of
his special representative to Angola to postpone the date until
July 25.
</P>
<P>
The original date of enforcing sanctions was set by a Security
Council resolution dated June 12, which provides for the
implementation of measures unless UNITA lives up to its peace
obligations by June 23.
</P>
<P>
UNITA has been criticized for delaying the turnover of four
strategic regions it controls to the central government, failing
to demobilize its fighters as requested by the 1994 Lusaka
Protocol, and for attacking government officials and U.N.
personnel.
</P>
<P>
According to Annan's special envoy in Angola Alioune Blondin
Beye, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi expressed his willingness on
Wednesday to cooperate with the government in extending state
administration to the four regions by June 30.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Dos Santos has agreed to defer the
implementation of sanctions until July 1.
</P>
<P>
The sanction measures include freezing funds and financial
resources of UNITA as an organization and its senior officials,
and renouncing all official contacts with the UNITA leadership.
</P>
<P>
They also include a prohibition on importing diamonds without a
certificate of origin from the Angolan government, and from
selling mining equipment, motorized vehicles, or water
transportation services to areas the government does not control.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Former first lady Imelda Marcos
announced on Thursday that the burial of late president Ferdinand
Marcos at the heroes' cemetery will be postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
"In the spirit of national interest, our family is prepared to
wait... the burial of the late president Marcos will be deferred
to a more appropriate time," Imelda said in a statement sent to
media outlets.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Marcos family said Imelda made the
decision after a closed-door "spiritual consultation" with a major
religious group El Shaddai's leader Mike Velarde late Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Imelda also expressed thanks to president-elect Joseph Estrada
"for his compassion and kindness in announcing his intent to give
the late president an honorable burial."
</P>
<P>
Estrada has been standing pat on his decision to bury the
remains of the late strongman at the heroes' cemetery although it
has triggered a wave of protests from several sectors.
</P>
<P>
Former president Corazon Aquino, whose husband Benigno Aquino
Jr. was assassinated during the rule of Marcos, is spearheading a
multisectoral group opposing the burial of Marcos at the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
The leftist rebel group New People's Army also announced
earlier that in protest against the burial at the cemetery, which
is reserved for heroes and soldiers who died in line of duty, they
already sent out special teams to track down and "arrest" members
of the Marcos family.

U.S. dollars a barrel as of the beginning of this year, far less
than the benchmark price of 21 dollars per barrel set by OPEC.
</P>
<P>
The cheap prices are a blessing for oil-consuming countries
like the United States, but mean disaster to oil producers by
causing difficulties for them in meeting their national budget
targets.

COLOMBO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Under an agreement signed recently

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Proposes Deficit Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
has proposed a deficit budget to parliament, saying it would help
revive the economy and provide a safety net for people affected by
the current financial and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chuan kicked off the parliament's three-day deliberation on the
fiscal 1999 budget bill with a two-hour speech Wednesday on the
government's plan for its 825-billion-baht (20.6 billion U.S.
dollars) budget, Thursday's Nation newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The budget, equivalent to 14.8 percent of the country's gross
domestic product (GDP), comprises 231.47 billion baht (5.78
billion dollars) for government projects, 588.12 billion baht
(14.7 billion dollars) in fixed expenditure and 5.4 billion baht
(135 million dollars) for debt servicing.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said the government expected the economic growth to rise
to between 1 and 2 percent in 1999 due to government spending to
revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's GDP, which grew by around 8 percent annually during
the 1985-1995 boom, is expected to shrink by between 4 to 5.5
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said the government expects to receive 800 billion baht
(20 billion dollars) in revenue and obtain 25 billion baht (625
million dollars) in loans for 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the fiscal year beginning October 1, inflation
should drop to 6 to 7 percent from the projected 10.5 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
Lower inflation, he said, will help boost liquidity and will
have the Export and Import Bank grant more loans to increase
liquidity in the economic system.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is to give priority to increasing
exports and the service sector and boosting tourism, while
reducing the social impact of the economic crisis which has
gripped Thailand since last July's baht float.

<P>
GUILIN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- With its unique natural scenery and
folk customs, Guilin Prefecture in south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region has grown to be one of the country's major
tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture is situated in the subtropical northeastern part
of Guangxi, with ten counties under its jurisdiction and a total
population of 3.38 million, including 540,000 people of Zhuang,
Yao, Miao, Dong and Hui ethnic groups.

All the counties boast outstanding scenic spots of their own.
Xing'an County is famous for its ancient Lingqu Canal, which is
one of the oldest, ingeniously built and well-preserved ancient
water conservation projects in the world.
</P>
<P>
The imposing and beautiful Mao'er Mountain in the county is the
most attractive mountain in southern China. And a tint of mystery
has been added to it since the wreckage of an American military
plane during World War II was found there by local residents in
October 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the Longsheng Autonomous County of various ethnic groups,
two springs with cool and hot water blend into a pool of warm
water. As many as 100 people can bathe in the pool at the same
time. The terraced farming fields and dense virgin forests also
stimulate tourists' imagination and courage for explorations.
</P>
<P>
Drifting in the Zijiang River of Ziyuan County offers both
excitement and entertainment to people of nerve.
</P>
<P>

Shous of different type of writing, exhibits the exquisite stone
sculpting art of the Chinese nearly 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Water flowing through the Tianhu Power Plant in Quanzhou County
has a drop of 1,074 m, the highest in Asia. The rumble of

In other counties such as Gongcheng and Lingchuan, historic
sites and serene resorts also attract tourists.
</P>
<P>
All the counties constitute a large tourism area with Guilin
City at the center.
</P>
<P>
In the prefecture, there are six sites listed as major national
or provincial scenic places, three forest nature reserves and 35
major cultural sites. Moreover, there are colorful and charming
folk customs in the local minority ethnic groups.

percent over the same period of last year. The influx of overseas
tourists even rose by 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Guilin Prefecture has booming agriculture,
forestry and mining industry. Many kinds of farm produce are
popular on both domestic and overseas markets. Forest coverage
rate stands 42.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The area is also rich in more than 40 kinds of minerals
containing manganese, tin, lead, zinc, copper, gold, iron, talcum,
barite, fluorite and quartzite. And there are great potentials for
the development of building materials such as marble, granite and
limestone.
</P>

LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Swimming
Federation's (FINA) doping panel will hold a meeting on the case
of triple Olympic swimming champion Michelle Smith of Ireland on
July 24.
</P>
<P>
FINA secretary Gunnar Werner confirmed the hearing date
Wednesday. The panel will examine allegations that the Irish
swimmer manipulated a urine sample - an offense punishable by a
life ban.
</P>
<P>
A FINA spokesman said the doping panel would proceed with or
without the presence of Smith.
</P>
<P>
FINA submitted Smith's case to its doping panel for
investigation on May 25 after analysis of her backup sample showed
the same signs of alleged tampering as her first specimen.
</P>
<P>
FINA said her urine sample showed "unequivocal signs of
adulteration" and "physical manipulation."
</P>
<P>
The samples allegedly containd a lethal concentration of
alcohol.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Becomes Shanghai's 2nd Largest Trade Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States became the
second largest trade partner of this east China economic
powerhouse last year as the latter's trade volume with it reached
3.7 billion U.S. dollars in the year.
</P>
<P>
The volume of the two-way trade has been growing by annual
average of 27.37 percentage points since 1990. In the first four
months of this year, the trade volume amounted to 1.28 billion
U.S. dollars, a rise of 33 percent over the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's current top trade partner is Japan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that Shanghai's trade with the U.S. has
entered a period of fast growth as the former is working to turn
itself into an international economic, trade and financial center,
with an annual import volume of 10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 22 Shanghai-funded enterprises in the
U.S., and more than 30 Shanghai firms have gone to the U.S. to
hold trade fairs over the past three years; while some 500,000
American businesspeople visited Shanghai in the five years from
1993-1997.
</P>
<P>
With the Clinton Administration's trade policy focused on
expansion of export as a main stimulant for growth and employment,
and Shanghai's need of sophisticated technology and equipment from
the United States to support its fast expanding economy with a
targeted annual GDP growth of 10 percent for the next three years,
the two enjoy wide prospects in their trade, said the analysts.

STOCKHOLM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Two Swedish missionaries
kidnapped in the southern Russian republic of Dagestan have been
freed, the Swedish Foreign Ministry confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Daniel and Paulina Brolin, who were abducted on January 8, had

An Chechen government official said that the couple had been
transferred to several different places during their captivity.
</P>
<P>
He denied allegations that security forces had confronted the
kidnappers in rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
There were reports saying a 30-man unit of Dagestan and Chechen
security forces had engaged the kidnappers during the past three
days, but nobody was hurt.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry credited the Pentecostal church in the
region with the success of the release, adding that the ministry

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Trade volume between south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the United States has
multiplied over the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Since Guangxi began trading with the U.S. in 1981, two-way
trade between the two sides has grown at an average rate of over
30 percent every year.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate is still going up. In 1997, trade volume
between the two sides rose by 50 percent to 193 million U.S.
dollars compared with 1996. The U.S. surpassed Japan as the third
largest trade partner with Guanxi in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenxue, vice-chairman of the autonomous region, said that
"trade and economic exchanges between Guangxi and the U.S. have
seen outstanding achievements in the past decade and have a
bright future."
</P>
<P>
A number of big U.S. companies such as Coca Cola, Dole and Wall
International Investment have invested in Guangxi. By the end of
1997, 278 U.S. businesses have actually put in a total of nearly 190
million US dollars in Guangxi with the combined contractual volume
being 588.64 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has signed larged contracts with U.S. companies in
recent years. CEA company of the U.S. has participated the
construction of three water hydro-electric power stations, costing
a total of 110 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that Guangxi needs advanced technology and equipment
to update its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is negotiating with SEWA company island of
the U.S. on a 200-million-US-dollar exhibition center project.
</P>
<P>
American investment accounts for 5.3 percent of total foreign
investment in Guangxi. Zhang said that Guangxi's economic and trade
cooperation with the U.S. still has great potential.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome big U.S. companies to come to Guangxi and invest in
infrastructure projects and projects producing competitive
products," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Work at the United Nations (UN)
diplomatic conference here to create an International Criminal
Court (ICC) is progressing satisfactorily, Italian Foreign
Under-secretary Patrizia Toia said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a growing interest in the conference's work," she
said.
</P>
<P>
If created, the court will have judicial powers to investigate
and pass judgement on a list of crimes, including crimes against
humanity and genocide, and almost certainly war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Toia told a symposium on the court that the "high hurdles" are
still to come. She was refering to demands by some leading powers
that the court should act under the aegis of the U.N. Security
Council, and proposals from others to limit the court's autonomy.
</P>
<P>
She cited a point by South Korea which was now suggesting that
the court would only need the consent of the country where the
alleged criminal trial was to proceed.
</P>
<P>
This suggestion was half-way to a German proposal that the
court's jurisdiction should be universal, and a British one that
the court could only exercise its jurisdiction with the consent of
the state where the alleged crime was committed.
</P>
<P>
"Let's hope five weeks is enough for a good result," said Toia,
who complained that the media had largely ignored the conference
from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
"We have to believe we can do it," She said.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Copper Exports to Reduce 1.1 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chile's copper exports will
decrease by 1.1 billion U.S. dollars this year, due to the low
price of copper in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Much of the blame for the low price has been placed on the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Mining Minister Sergio Jimenez said the government will
increase copper exports to help reduce losses. He said Chile
would not cut copper production to support the metal price.
</P>
<P>
The Asian crisis has affected the revenues of the country's
National Copper Corporation in a number of ways. The corporation
has postponed expanding several mines in the south and central
part of the country, and about 1,800 workers have lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Chile is the biggest copper exporter and producer in the
world. Its annual output of copper amounts to 3 million tons and
copper exports earn 15 billion dollars for Chile every year.

<HEADLINE> Expert Calls for Settlement Fund for Unemployed, Laid-offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese expert is calling for
establishing a special fund for unemployed people and laid-off
workers from state enterprises in China.
</P>
<P>
Cao Siyuan, a social sciences scholar, said Wednesday at an
ongoing international seminar on Chinese social security that the
labor departments should set up two basic funds to solve the
problems of the unemployed and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Many workers have lost their jobs because of reforms at
state-owned enterprises and a lack of technical skills, Cao said,
adding that helping them is important for the country's economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China had more than 111 million workers in
1996 and more than 70 percent of them were employed by state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China issued a regulation in 1986 to require enterprises to
turn over one percent of the employees' wages as unemployment
insurance, which would be given to the laid-off workers as a
relief fund.
</P>
<P>
"But the relief funds can only support their basic life needs,"
said Cao, adding that it is an urgent need to set up a fund which
provides a settlement allowance for the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The fund would help the unemployed arrange their future life
and be re-employed in a shorter period, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ashic Dawen, a social security expert with the World Bank, said
that the unemployment arrangement fund is an efficient method for
enterprise reform in many developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The fund usually comes from the sale of land-use rights, the
state-run holding companies and the national budget, Dawen
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Against Amending Dayton Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 24 (Xinhua) -- United States Ambassador to Bosnia
Richard Kauzlarich said here Wednesday that his country will
neither agree to or allow amendments to be made to the Dayton
Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. insists that the Dayton accord be thoroughly
implemented and all signing parties obliged to fulfill the
agreement, Kauzlarich said to a Bosnian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
As the September date for scheduled elections in Bosnia
approaches, a call to amend the Dayton peace accord has begun.
</P>
<P>
Kauzlarich said that any amendment, whether to divide Bosnia or
to establish three entities, is totally unacceptable. This will
not gain support from the United States, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the appeal by current Chairman of the Presidency
of Bosnia Alija Izetbegovic to amend the accord, Kauzlarich said,
"Our focus should be on how to carry out the accord instead of
discussing how to amend it."
</P>
<P>
The Dayton peace accord, which was signed in December 1995 in
the U.S., ended the 3.5-year-old war in Bosnia.

YANGON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities seized a

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Using More Efficient Fingerprint-Processing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese police have begun
using a new fingerprint-processing system to more quickly pick out
a real criminal among thousands of suspects.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun Jing'ao, a professor with the Beijing Posts
and Telecommunications University and a major researcher working
on the new system, the Chinese police today are capable of finding
one fingerprint in a 500,000-person data bank within two
minutes. They used to spend one whole day to find an individual
fingerprint in a 100,000-person data bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Ministry of Public Security said the
system will tremendously improve the efficiency and quality of
criminal investigation by the country's police, and usher in
a new development period of building and applying fingerprint
processing systems.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the republic in 1949, the official said,
the utilization of a fingerprint data bank has played an important
role in helping police find criminals.
</P>
<P>
However, since China's reform started in 1978, the
country has witnessed an economic boom and an increasingly larger
transient population, which has made cross-regional crime more of
a problem.
</P>
<P>
"This has made the traditional method of managing and utilizing
fingerprint processing inadequate," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The system, jointly invented by the Beijing Posts and
Telecommunications Univerity and Qinghua University, "has a larger
memory capacity and is easier to be upgraded compared with other
domestic and overseas fingerprint-processing systems," Sun
said.

<HEADLINE> China Has Confidence in Pollution Control, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A top environmental protection
official said here Wednesday that China has confidence in
controling environmental pollution although it faces a serious
situation.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State General Administration of
Environmental Protection, said at a news conference that "China
will strive to bring pollution and ecological damage under control
in less than three years, and improve the environmental quality of
a number of cities and regions."
</P>
<P>
He said that to achieve the goal the state will spend 450
billion yuan before 2000 on environmental protection, which
accounts for 1.3 percent of the country's gross national product
(GNP) in the period.
</P>
<P>
"More than 180 billion yuan of the fund will be spent on
1,500-plus projects to improve the environment in major river
valleys and regions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that China's major pollution control efforts will be
put on major river valleys including the Huaihe River, and the
Taihu and Dianchi lakes, as well as sulfur dioxide and acid rain
control zones.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing has also been listed as one of the country's major
pollution control regions," he said.
</P>
<P>
China also plans to enhance ecological protection and speed up
the establishment of nature reserves for the protection of rare
and endangered animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, more new laws will be drafted, and the existing
laws and regulations will be improved," he said, adding that China
will strengthen law enforcement to crack down on environmental
violations.
</P>
<P>
Xie said China is taking steps to reduce energy consumption for
every unit of gross domestic product (GDP) and greenhouse gas
production, to adjust the energy structure and to actively develop
geothermal, solar and wind energy sources.
</P>
<P>
"China will contribute its efforts to global environmental
protection during this trans-century period," he said.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Estonian President Lennart Meri
said Wednesday that Estonia should strengthen its good-neighborly
relations with Russia, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On June 23, the Estonian Victory Day which commemorates the
country's triumph over Soviet troops at the Battle of Nonnu in
1919, Estonia held a parade of 700 soldiers and officers in the
central square of the city of Viljandi.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the military review, Meri said the guns of Estonian
troops were not targeted at Russia, and Estonia must develop
good-neighborly ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The president said the two countries had made positive progress
in bilateral ties. Consolidation of the bonds conformed to the
interests of Estonia and the European Union (EU), he said.
</P>
<P>
Meri also pointed out that the key to his country's entry into
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was in the hands of
Estonia itself.
</P>
<P>
The past two years had witnessed improvement in relations
between Estonia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
However, the improvement remained constrained because of the
grave differences between the two countries over the status of
ethnic Russians' in Estonia, and Estonia's bid to join NATO.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Australian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Prime Minister John Howard denied Wednesday that
the government-endorsed 5.2 billion U.S. dollar Melbourne-Darwin
rail link was a snub to the state of South Australia and the
Adelaide-Darwin link after the state's Premier John Olsen
described the plan as a "pie in the sky".
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian government will announce Thursday it will
nominate 1 million hectares of the Blue Mountains for listing on
the World Heritage Register, forcing restrictions on any future
escarpment development.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Big personal tax cuts delivered in one hit, a single-rate
goods and services tax and compensation for pensioners and
low-income earners will be key elements of the tax package the
Australian government takes to the looming federal election.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's trade surplus with Japan has been slashed by 20
percent this year after a surge in Japanese exports of consumer
goods and cars and a slump in Australian commodity exports to the
East Asian country.

<HEADLINE> Bad Loans Predicted to Rise in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- With most of local firms still
reeling from the negative effects of the currency crisis, the
level of non-performing loans in Philippine commercial banks is
expected to increase in the near term from the 7.58 percent
recorded in March.
</P>
<P>
The Business World newspaper Thursday quoted Gabriel Singson,
governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines, as saying that
while the slow decline in interest rates in recent weeks has
brightened prospects for lesser non-performing loans, the
tightening of rules on the classification of overdue loans will
offset any improvements.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to specify to what level non-performing loans
will rise, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
"If you include thrift banks and rural banks, the
non-performing loan level is already slightly over 8 percent. The
rise in non-performing loans in the past two weeks can be
attributed to high interest rates in the last quarter of 1997 to
the first quarter of 1998," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates in the Philippines have declined over the past
three weeks from 26-31 percent to 15-20 percent with the adoption
of measures by both the central bank and the Bankers Association
of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Singson said it usually takes some time before the effect of a
decline in interest rates is reflected in the financial
performance of corporate borrowing.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines will still have the lowest
non-performing loan level compared with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In some other Southeast Asian countries, the level of bad debts
have already reached 30 to 50 percent of banks' total loan
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
International Monetary Fund representative Henri Lorie said
earlier that he did not expect bad loans in the Philippine banking
system to go beyond 10 percent this year.

SANTIAGO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 64,602 new vehicles
were sold in Chile during the first five months of the year, 0.8
percent down from the same period last year, the local media
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The car sales for the whole 1998 are expected to be lower than
1997, according to Chile's National Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
The association ascribed this situation to the rise of interest
rates and the U.S. dollar's price level against the peso.

<HEADLINE> Second Seed Rios Crashes out of Wimbledon Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Marcelo Rios of Chile
has crashed out of the on-going 1998 Wimbledon tennis
championships after losing to a little known Spanish opponent
in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Rios, who briefly occupied the top spot of world ranking early
this year, was obviously in a depression state and failed to gain
any expected advantage over his opponent.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first and third sets with 3-6 and 5-7, the
temperamental Chilean snatched the second and fourth sets with
identical score of 6-3. However, with hope bickering in sight,
Rios seemed unable to focus his attention on the tennis and gave
away the last set 3-6 easily.
</P>
<P>
Fouth seed Briton Greg Rusedski, who picked up an ankle injury
in a pre-Wimbledon event, was forced to withdraw from the
tournament after his ankle injury made him possible to play with
Australian Mark Draper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the other major stars including defending champion
Pete Sampras of the United States, third seed Petr Korda of Czech
Republic and French Open champion Carlos Moya of Spain have all
overcame another hurdle by beating their opponents.
</P>
<P>
In the women's events, seven-times champion German Steffi Graf,
Americans Monica Seles and Lindsey Davenport all advanced to the
third round after beating their rivals separately.
</P>
<P>
However, women's nine seed Amanda Coetzer of South Africa was
knocked out at the championships after losing to her Japanese
opponent Naoko Sawamatsu 6-3, 3-6, 2-6 in the second round.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Approves Creation of Gene Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The lower house of German parliament
on Wednesday approved a new law to legalize the creation of a
central genetic databank in Germany to help track down criminals.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, which still needs the endorsement of the
upper house of the parliament, German police could conduct DNA
testing during investigations of serious crimes such as murder and
rape.
</P>
<P>
The new law would also allow the police to keep the genetic
data of people already convicted of serious crimes in the new data
bank.
</P>
<P>
Pressure for the new law came after a large-scale DNA testing
in the western German city of Cloppenburg last month had helped
the police to arrest the criminal who raped and murdered a
11-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
The criminal was arrested after his DNA matched evidence found
at the scene of the rape. He had already been jailed for three
years for another sexual abuse in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The German Interior Ministry noted that the case showed the
need for a genetic file on all people convicted of serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
Genetic testing has been used for years in Germany to clarify
crimes. However, until recently, the DNA data of offenders should
be scrapped after their conviction for reasons of privacy
protection.

<HEADLINE> Clemente Says He Feels Sad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LENS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Spain coach Javier Clemente said on
Wednesday that he felt sad after his side was denied a place in the
World Cup finals for the first time in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad but life goes on. I think our pride was evident in
these three games. For better or worse I think the team showed its
unity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "It's disappointing after we played an excellent match,
all our efforts were in vain."
</P>
<P>
"You have to congratulate Paraguay," Clemente said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria coach Hristo Bonev also said he was sad because his team,
semifinalists four years ago, could not even reach last 16 this time.
</P>
<P>
"I realize we disappointed all our supporters. It was a
disappointing tournament for us," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We were the weakest team in our group. We will have to analyze the
game, but it looked like the team had already given up. They did not
fight," Bonev said.

LENS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian coach Hristo Bonev said he was

<P>
"I am a man of principles and after what I saw, I cannot continue,"
he said after the game.

The 51-year-old Bonev took over the team in 1996 after a
disappointing performance at the 1996 European Championships.

<HEADLINE> Senate Committee Approves Flag-Protecting Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A Senate panel on Wednesday
approved an attempt to let Congress outlaw desecration of the flag
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The measure approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee would
amend the Constitution to give Congress the authority.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Republican and the proposal's
sponsor, said he disagreed with opponents who contend it would
weaken the First Amendment right to freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
"Mutilating our nation's great symbol of national unity is
simply not necessary to express an opinion," Hatch said. "Those
individuals who have a message to the country should not confuse
their right to speak with the conduct of desecrating a symbol that
embodies the ideals of a nation that Americans have given their
lives to protect."
</P>
<P>
The amendment, which states "the Congress shall have power to
prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United
States," was approved by a 10 to 7 vote. Before it became a part
of the Constitution, it would require two-thirds approval of both
the Senate and House, then ratification by three-fourths of the
states.

<HEADLINE> Irish President Says Peace Unstoppable in Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Irish President Mary McAleese
said here on Wednesday the momentum for peace in Ireland was
unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
McAleese made the remarks at the National Press Club on the eve
of elections to a new power-sharing Northern Ireland assembly to
be set up under a peace accord in April.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed her hope that voters would "display the
same political maturity" on Thursday as they did in strongly
backing the accord in a referendum last month.
</P>
<P>
She said that was a defining moment in the history of Ireland
and that the peace accord created a new political landscape.
</P>
<P>
"The day of the dinosaurs is over," she told reporters, adding
that "the future belongs to the bridge builders not to the
wreckers."
</P>
<P>
McAleese met U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday. Clinton
promised Washington would continue to involve in the Irish peace
process.
</P>
<P>
McAleese, who visited the U.S. for the first time since she
became Ireland's president last year, said she was heartened by
Clinton's pledge.
</P>
<P>
Later this week, she will meet U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in New York.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that it was ready to back Russia's request for more
international financial aid with the condition that Moscow
implements economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers at a Senate subcommittee hearing on the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Summers said the new Russian government had made the right
policy commitments, centering on better tax collection, a more
efficient financial system and a better environment for foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
"As we saw in our discussions...with Japan, I think it is very
important that the actions match the rhetoric," Summers said,
referring to the situation in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"What would be very important in coming weeks in Russia is that
they are able to start to take the necessary action to correctly
address their problems," Summers added.
</P>
<P>
Summers said strong policies would hold the key to additional
international financial support.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the other G-7 countries -- have indicated a
willingness to support as necessary and appropriate additional
financing from the international financial institutions for
Russia, conditional on strong reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The key would be Russia's ability to establish strong credible
policies, especially in the fiscal and banking areas, in the
coming weeks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has said it needs additional cash from the
international financial community, including both bilateral
assistance and a big new loan from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).

on Wednesday for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the
Middle East, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after a meeting of the Saudi-Egyptian Joint
Higher Committee said the peace in the region should be made on
the basis of the land-for-peace principle and United Nations
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The statement held Israel responsible for the deadlock in its
peace talks with the Palestinians, and urged it to resume

<HEADLINE> Information Needed in Uganda's Development: UNDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Lack of proper information and
communication systems are a missing link in the development of
most developing countries including Uganda, an official with the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has said.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Bakele, the chief technical adviser of UNDP's Private
Sector Development Program, made the statement while meeting with
Uganda's Minister of State in the President's Office in Charge of
Information Basoga Nsadhu here Wednesday morning, Radio Uganda
reported Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Their discussion was focused on the issue of communication
which she said was very fundamental in the eradication of poverty
and economic development in the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bakele said that even good economic policies cannot achieve
much without a communication system which initially studies the
environment and the person it is intended to change, because the
main objective in development is to change a person.
</P>
<P>
She said proper communication is needed for the issues to be
properly internalized by the beneficiaries, citing the example of
the Ministry of Health which has many out-reached programs which
are not properly coordinated.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure should be improved so as to strengthen the
communication system in the east African country, she added.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP official also commended the Ugandan government for
being receptive to ideas on improving the information and
communication system.
</P>
<P>
The minister of state said the government has recognized the
crucial role of information and communication to development and
outlined the measures the government has taken in this direction.
</P>
<P>
He asked her to work in partnership with the Department of
Information to improve efficiency of this sector.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief: Arab Summit Still Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Arab League chief Esmat Abdel-Meguid
said Wednesday that consultations are under way for holding an
Arab summit to seek ways of breaking the deadlock in the Mideast
peace process, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The possibilities of holding such a summit still stand, but
the date and the venue of the meeting have not been determined
yet," Abdel-Meguid said in an interview with the British
Broadcasting Corporation in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
He denied allegations that some "international reasons" - such
as the unwillingness of the United States to let the Arabs sit
together - are obstructing the summit.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
has called for convening the summit to unify Arab stance on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
On an emergency meeting of the Arab League due on Thursday, he
said, it will discuss the Israeli plan to expand the authority of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which will be attended by representatives of the 22
Arab members, is likely to adopt a resolution backing the
Palestinian stance, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet Sunday approved a plan to set up an
"umbrella authority" for Jerusalem over eight West Bank Jewish
settlements to the east, north and south of the city.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have accused Israel of killing the peace
process by endorsing the plan, which will change the status of the
holy city.
</P>
<P>
Under peace accords signed between the Palestinians and Israel,
neither side should take unilateral actions to change the status
of Jerusalem before the final status talks for a permanent peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs would urge the international community, especially
the U.S., to stand against the Israeli stubbornness, the Arab
League chief said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Vows to Continue Nuke Deal With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian official said here
Wednesday that Moscow will go ahead with its deal of building a
nuclear plant in India despite outside pressure.
</P>
<P>
Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov told a press conference
that Moscow will not "give up such a commercial project under the
pressure from other countries in order not to lose the opportunity
to make a profit."
</P>
<P>
The minister said Russia and India plan to sign the contract
within three months.
</P>
<P>
He did not specify what countries exerted pressure, but U.S.
State Department spokesman James Rubin, just after Russia and
India initialed an agreement on the construction of two
1,000-megawatt reactors, said, "It sends the wrong signal at the
wrong time."
</P>
<P>
"It's bad news," Rubin said. "We are going to urge the Russian
government to reconsider."
</P>
<P>
Adamov, who signed the deal in New Delhi on June 21, did not
disclose the value of the contract, but said a sum of 2.6 billion
U.S. dollars as reported was a "normal figure," the Interfax news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Moscow's position on India's nuclear tests that
New Delhi should join the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the
nuclear technology non-proliferation regime.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is bound by these treaties and does not violate them.
Our interests boil down to developing cooperation only for
peaceful purposes while not overstepping this limit," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Adamov said the nuclear power plant consisting two VVER-1000
light-water power-generating reactors will be built on a turn-key
basis like in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Moscow also ignored Washington's pressure and stuck to its
cooperation with Tehran in nuclear energy cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation has prompted the U.S. congress to launch a
bill intended to impose sanctions on companies suspected of
helping Iran's missile development program.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton Tuesday vetoed the legislation, a
move lauded by the Russia as "meeting the spirit of
Russian-American relations."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Wednesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry
said, "The Russian leadership is pursuing a firm policy aimed at
preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
their means of delivery, including supply of any illegal rocket
technologies to Iran."

UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi

<HEADLINE> 11,000 Crows Killed in Dar es Salaam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 11,000 destructive
Indian house crows have been trapped and killed in Dar es Salaam
over the past year, a wildlife conservation officer said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Paul Nyiti, an officer with the Wildlife Conservation of
Tanzania, told reporters in the Tanzanian capital that house
crows pose a great threat to other bird species and public
health.
</P>
<P>
Nyiti said the crows, with a population of 400,000, have
chased away several other birds. They are also aggressive
predators to domestic poultry but they themselves have no natural
enemy.
</P>
<P>
The crows also transmit diseases by picking up and dropping
rubbish into water wells and tanks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, people have complained that the crows make noises,
steal food and valuables such as golden chains.
</P>
<P>
Since last July, 916 house crows have been trapped and killed
each month with the financial support of individuals and the
Canadian Fund for Local Initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Trapping sites include schools, hospitals, vegetable farms and
markets, Nyiti said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Canadian fund has facilitated construction of 25
crow traps each at a cost of 100,000 Shillings (about 150 U.S.
Dollars). The traps are placed in different parts of the city
monitored by four field officers. However, the project is faced
with serious funding problem.
</P>
<P>
The conservation officer said a survey on 300 people in the
city show that the majority of them support the drive in
eradicating the house crows.
</P>
<P>
A program in controlling the bird using poison as bait was
implemented during 1990 and 1995, he said. The program was
successful but suspended later due to financial constraints. The
number of crows has risen again in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The officer revealed that the strategy to poison the crows
will be adopted in Dar es Salaam, if it is permitted by
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Indian house crows were introduced in East Africa late last
century and have a major pest in coastal cities.

<P>
The organization groups Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria,
Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, Russia and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Individual efforts of the countries are not enough to prevent
drug smuggling that is a crime against humanity," Baseskioglu said.
</P>
<P>
He called for a regional cooperation mechanism for combating
organized crimes and drug trafficking on the Balkan route and the
Northern route.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that a multilateral agreement which will be signed
by the aforesaid countries be more extensive to provide peace and
determination against the threat of terrorism and maintain a more
effective cooperation in struggle against drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and its neighbors are the key transit routes of drug to
Europe from the border area of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's VX Nerve Agent Tests, Unambiguous: Butler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The results of the tests
made by a U.S. army laboratory showed unambiguously that Iraq had
put deadly VX nerve gas into missile warheads before the Gulf war,
the chief U.N. weapons inspector said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, executive chairman of the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM)in charge of the dismantling of Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, made the remark after he briefed the
Security Council of the United Nations on his recent visit to
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"These degradation products could be from no other substance.
These are unique products. They are VX. They were found in a
missile warhead. That is weaponization," Butler told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Butler said what he would do next was to find out how much of
this substance Iraq had made, where Iraq had put it and where it
was now, and he would discuss these issues with the Iraqi
government during his next talks in Baghdad next month.
</P>
<P>
He said he would also send the samples to other countries to be
tested and confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has maintained that although it had tried to produce VX,
the nerve gas was in a stable enough form to be deployed in
weapons.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Washington Post said Tuesday that a U.S. army
laboratory had found traces of VX nerves agent in samples of Scud
missile warhead fragments recovered in March from a destruction
site at Nibai, north of Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Spiritual Leader Yassin Returns to Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Hamas (Islamic
Resistance Movement) spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin returned
to Gaza Wednesday evening from Cairo after a four-month
fund-raising trip abroad, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Yassin entered Gaza Strip through the Rafah border crossing
point and received a heroic welcome upon his arrival by Hamas
officials and his supporters both at the Gaza side of the border
crossing and his home in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, 62, also founder of Hamas, left Gaza in late February
on a short trip to Cairo for medical treatment. Then he embarked
on a tour of the Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
During his tour of nearly a dozen Arab capitals, he made fiery
statements praising suicide bombers, calling on Palestinians to
carry on an armed struggle against Israel, particularly Israel's
occupation of the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
He stayed in Sudan for two more weeks waiting for Israel's
permission for him to return to Gaza. But Israel left it open till
the last minute whether to allow Yassin to return home.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have said they considered Yassin more of a
threat abroad than in Gaza where his movements can be monitored by
the Palestinian authorities and Israeli security establishments.
</P>
<P>
This was Yassin's second homecoming to Gaza in nine
months. Israel was forced to release him from prison last October
for exchange of two Israeli intelligence Mossad agents who were
caught trying to kill another Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Yassin served eight years of a life term in Israel's prison
for ordering the killing of Israeli soldiers and Palestinians
accused of collaborating with the Israelis.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Births Continue to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Births in Canada declined for a
sixth consecutive years in 1996 and the trend shows no sign of
reversing, Statistics Canada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Natural growth in the Canadian population declined to 5.7 per
1,000 from 7.7 per 1,000 between 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, natural growth accounted for only 47 percent of the
country's total population growth, while immigration accounted for
53 percent.
</P>
<P>
An aging population reduces natural growth since it is
accompanied by an increase in deaths. At the same time, the number
of deaths continues to decline, the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, the total fertility rate has remained stagnant for
many years at 1.6 children per woman. And there are fewer
child-bearing women born in generations after the baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
"Unless there is an immediate and significant recovery of the
fertility rate, the decline in the number of births will continue
before stabilizing at a relatively low level," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
"It is likely that by the year 2020, Canada's natural growth in
the population will approach zero," it noted.

PARIS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Football Association (AFA)
announced that national team coach Daniel Passarella will step down

</P>
<P>
AFA president Julio Grondona said:"Passarella already said he

<P>
Passarella is reported to have a stormy relationship with the
AFA and his players. Grondona said he was in no hurry to change
Passarella's mind.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders for Durable Goods Drop in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
big-ticket goods dropped 2.6 percent in May, the largest decline
in five months, the Commerce Department reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in durable-goods orders to a seasonally adjusted
184.3 billion U.S. dollars followed gains of 1.6 percent in April
and 0.3 percent in March, the department said. It was the largest
fall since a 5.3 percent drop in December, last year.
</P>
<P>
Orders in May fell in two volatile categories, which had
increased sharply the month before: civilian aircraft and military
goods.
</P>
<P>
Orders for military goods plunged 20.6 percent in May after
shooting up 38.3 percent in April. For civilian aircraft, orders
fell 13.3 percent after jumping 39.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Even excluding those two categories, orders were down 1.3
percent. They fell 4.1 percent for primary metals such as steel,
1.2 percent for industrial machinery and equipment and 6.8 percent
for electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
Though orders rose for autos and parts, transportation orders
overall fell 3.5 percent when aircraft orders were included.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of durable goods, a measure of current production,
slipped 0.2 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted 186.7 billion
dollars after a 1.8 percent drop in April.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Resurging Worldwide: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaria is resurging in many
countries where it has been sharply reduced or even eradicated
and more than a third of the world's total population now live in
malaria endemic areas, experts say Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 300 to 500 million clinical cases and 1.5
to 2.7 million deaths occur due to malaria each year, about twice
as many as 20 years ago, according to papers presented at the
third Pan-African Conference on Malaria which ended here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 100 experts and senior health officials from 34 African
countries attended the continent's top-level anti-malaria meeting
which started Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Currently the number of countries and regions suffering from
the disease reaches 100, said a press release issued by the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Annual number of deaths of children under five years of age
attributed to malaria hits one million, the experts said, "During
the last 10 years, malaria has killed 10 times more children than
all the wars that have raged over the same period."
</P>
<P>
Rapidly increased drug resistance is leaving populations with
no effective drug for prevention against or treatment of the
eighth lethal killer in the world -- the top one in Africa -- the
experts noted.
</P>
<P>
"Malaria is thus much more lethal in 1998 than in 1968," they
claimed.
</P>
<P>
"There is urgent need for research into new malaria compounds"
and more urgent need for enhanced joint efforts especially by
African countries to fight the disease, they said. Sub-Saharan
Africa hosts more than 90 percent of Malaria victims.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the only organized effort, in the continent,
addressing this issue (malaria) systematically is the African
Malaria Vaccine Testing Network," said Assistant Executive
Secretary Robert Mshana of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
The conference is aimed at enabling experts to exchange
scientific findings on epidemiology, therapeutic strategies and
the implementation of national anti-malaria programs.
</P>
<P>
The participants also studied the possibilities for the
establishment of a multi-national South-South cooperation on
researches and training in the field.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan Government to Cut Down Public Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The government of Moldova will
cut down public spending to ease the current financial crisis, the
Moldovan BASA-Press news agency quoted Vice- Premier Ion Sturza as
saying Wednesday
</P>
<P>
"This is a moment when we cannot honor the enormous budgetary
deficit, internal or foreign debts, we cannot honor our
commitments toward the employees and pensioners," Ion Sturza,
Vice-Premier and Economics Minister told a meeting of businessmen
in Chisinau.
</P>
<P>
Moldova's foreign debt soars up to 1.3 billion U.S. dollars and
exceeds the level of 60 percent of the gross domestic product,
while internal arrears amount to over 212.7 million U.S. dollars.
Confronting an acute financial crisis, Moldova has practically
stopped investing and repaying its debts.
</P>
<P>
Moldovan economics are infamous with money-losing enterprises,
Sturza said, adding that 80 per cent of agricultural companies and
50 percent of industrial companies are insolvent.
</P>
<P>
Finance minister Anatol Arapu said that this weekend the
government will discuss amendments to the budget with an eye on
cancellation of tax facilities, introduction of excises on luxury
items, increase of excises on fuel imports.

<HEADLINE> IMF Okays Three-Year ESAF Credit for Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Wednesday approved a three-year credit for Rwanda under the
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The credit equivalent to 95 million U.S. dollars will be
provided in support of the government's economic program for the
fiscal years from April 1998 to March 2001. The first annual loan,
equivalent to about 32 million dollars is available in two equal
semiannual installments, the first of which is available
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Over the medium term, the program for 1998/99 to 2000/01
supported by the ESAF seeks to achieve sustainable high economic
growth and poverty reduction. The program for 1998/99 is designed
to achieve a real GDP growth rate of 7 percent in 1998 and 8
percent in 1999, reduce the end-of-period rate of inflation to 7
percent in 1998 and to 5 percent in 1999, and temporarily increase
gross official reserves to just over six months of imports during
1998/99.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting member
countries undertaking economic reform programs to strengthen their
balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda joined the IMF in September 1963. Its quota is about 79
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing currently
totals about 39 million dollars.

<P>
LENS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Spain failed to enter the second round of
the World Cup finals for the first time in 16 years despite their 6-1
drubbing of Bulgaria in group D here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay, who beat group leaders Nigeria 3-1 in another game,
qualified as the second placers at five points on the standings, one
points ahead Spain at four. Nigeria had qualified with six points.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Hierro opened the scoring for Spain when he converted a
penalty kick only five minutes into the game, after striker Luis
Enrique was brought down by Ivaylo Iordanov in the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Enrique himself put Spain 2-0 ahead in the 18th minute, blasting
the ball past keeper Zdravko Zdravkov after receiving a pass from
Joseba Etxeberria.
</P>
<P>
The ball hit on the inner side of far post before bouncing into the
net.
</P>
<P>
Spain could have led by three goals at break had a header from
Francisco Morientes not went against the crossbar in the 36th minute.
</P>
<P>
Spain had their momentum going in the second half and Francisco
Morientes found the net in the 53rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria reduced the margin only five minute later through Emil
Kostadinov, who sent off a powerful shot into the net.
</P>
<P>
Spain made it 4-1 when Morientes scored his second goal in the game
in the 81st minute, tapping the ball into an empty goal after beating
an outgoing Zdravkov.
</P>
<P>
Athletico Madrid's Kiko completed the mauling by scoring a double
within two minutes, heading one home in the 88th minute and netting
the other in injury time.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Score Surprising 3-1 Victory over Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TOULOUSE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Underdogs Paraguay scored a
surprising 3-1 win over Super Eagles Nigeria to qualify for the
second round at the expense of Spain.
</P>
<P>
In the other match played simultaneously at Lens, Spain trounced
Bulgaria 6-1 for their first victory in the group but bursted into
tears when they heard of the Paraguay victory.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay, who had drawn their first two matches, garnered 5
points, one more than the Spaniards, and set up a clash against
hosts France in the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
The match was a surprise at the very beginning when Celso Ayala
headed home a free-kick less than one minute into the match.
</P>
<P>
The goal is the fastest so far in the France'98 World Cup
finals. The previous fastest goal was scored by Cesar Sampaio of
Brazil at 3:48 in the match against Scotland, the opening game of
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
But the lead didn't last long as Wilson Oruma levelled 1-1 for
Nigeria at the 10th minute after a splendid teamwork.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, the Nigerian team, which have been regarded
as one of the favorites of the tournament after their two wins over
Spain and Bulgaria, were totally outplayed by Paraguay and conceded
two more goals.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Benitez made it 2-1 for Paraguay at the 59th minute while
Jose Cardozo dealt Nigeria the final blow at the 87th minute to seal
up the 3-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
The victory will not shatter the top place of the Nigerian team but
dashed the qualifying hope of Spain who opened their scoring gate in
the match against Bulgaria which they won 6-1.
</P>
<P>
The result will also benefit the host team France as they will
now face Paraguay instead of Spain in the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
France will play the match without their playmaker Zinedine
Zidane due to suspension and the elimination of Spain will be a
good news for the host team.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Paraguay, Spain is a better side and can surely
pose greater threat to the French team.
</P>
<P>
For the Nigerian team, their next match will be an easy job as they
take on Denmark who squeezed into the top 16 despite suffering a 2-1
defeat at the hands of the French team earlier on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Japan to Take Action on Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Wednesday
urged Japan to take concrete action to meet its promises on
economic and bank sector reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Action is more important than words," Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers said at a hearing of Senate
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
He said last week's foreign exchange intervention, in which
both central banks of the United States and Japan sold dollars to
try to bolster the fragile yen, had created a window of
opportunity, which, however, would not last forever.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that the steps we can take, currency
intervention, can have an effect, but they have an effect
primarily through what they signal... What is crucial is the pace
of action because it is, over time, the markets' assessment of the
fundamentals that are important," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
The dollar sales, the first since 1992 for the United States to
step into foreign exchange markets to support the Japanese
currency, have helped the yen climb out of its eight year low
around 146.75 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
But as Japan's economic situation slipped into full-scale
recession this quarter after years of negligible growth, financial
markets have become increasingly worried about Japan's economic
weakness.
</P>
<P>
The weakness means the country, which still accounts for more
than half of Asia's gross domestic product, cannot boost demand
for goods from neighbor states, while the banking sector is
burdened with billions of dollars of bad debt.
</P>
<P>
Summers said, "It is critical that Japan must now act
decisively to resolve difficulties in its banking system, to make
clear its readiness to carry out further fiscal stimulus if needed
to achieve its goal of domestic demand-led growth."
