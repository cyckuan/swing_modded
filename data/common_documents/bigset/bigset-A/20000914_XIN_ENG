MEXICO CITY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Two peasants were killed
Thursday in Mexico's western state of Michoacan, when a container
of pesticide and fertilizer mixture exploded, said the Public
Ministry.

The same source said the two farmers were bothers and the

<HEADLINE> Government Can't Justify Handling of Lee Case: Clinton (With More Details) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This whole thing was quite troubling to me," President Clinton
said just hours after Attorney General Janet Reno refused to
apologize for the case at her weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters outside the White House after a speech,
the president said it was very difficult to reconcile the
government's positions "that one day he's a terrible risk to the
national security and the next day they're making a plea agreement
for an offense far more modest than what had been alleged."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can justify in retrospect keeping a person
in jail without bail when you're prepared to make that kind of
agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It just can't be justified. ... So I too am quite troubled by
it," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Lee, who worked at Los Alamos National
Laboratory for 20 years before he was fired last year, was
indicted in December on 59 counts of mishandling secrets.
</P>
<P>
The charges against the taiwan-born scientist by the
departments of Justice and Energy began to unravel after a key
witness in the case recently acknowledged that his previous
testimony against Lee was "inaccurate."
</P>
<P>
After nine months in jail, often in shackles, Lee was set free
Wednesday under a plea agreement with the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge James Parker said at the court that the top
levels of the departments of Justice and Energy "had embarrassed
our entire nation and each of us who is a citizen of it."
</P>
<P>
Reno, however, said earlier Thursday that she was comfortable
with the government's handling of the case. She said Lee "needs to
look to himself" rather than expect an apology from the U.S.
government.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Sees Jerusalem Issue as Key to Middle East Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordan said on
Thursday that the issue of Jerusalem is the key to peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs
Abdel-Elah Khatib said that East Jerusalem is a Palestinian
territory and should be placed under Palestinian sovereignty and
become the capital of the independent state of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Arab and Muslim rights in the Islamic and Christian holy places
in Jerusalem must be preserved, and in no way can Israeli
sovereignty over these holy places be accepted, the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the status of Jerusalem and its spiritual and religious
importance make it imperative that this city should be an open
city where the freedom of worship and access to the holy places is
assured for all believers.
</P>
<P>
Despite the failure of the recent Camp David Summit to reach an
agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis, he said, it
enabled the parties to narrow the gap between their positions and
made the requirements for reaching a settlement clearer.
</P>
<P>
The achievement of lasting peace in the region requires the
realization of the national rights of the Palestinian people,
primarily the right to independence and the establishment of their
state on their national territory, with the Holy City of Jerusalem
as its capital, he added.

<HEADLINE> Spain Backs Drafting General Convention on International Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th General Assembly
session which began here on Tuesday morning, Spanish Foreign
Minister Josep Pique said, "Unfortunately, globalization has also
generated fresh opportunities for the development of universal
scourges such as terrorism and transnational organized crime."
</P>
<P>
"At the same time it provides us with new instruments for
combating them, provided that we agree on how to use them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Spain supports the drafting of a general convention against
international terrorism and is grateful to India for its
initiative in this respect," he said. "The work aimed at adopting
a convention against transnational organized crime must also be
concluded."
</P>
<P>
In Madrid on Monday, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Azner
said, "It's going to be a long road" to fight against the
terrorist group ETA, a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, which the government blamed for an upsurge of
separatist killings.
</P>
<P>
ETA demands the right to self-determination for Spain's three
Basque provinces in the north. It envisions an independent state
that would also incorporate Basque regions in southwestern France.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislator Refutes Accusations on Religious Freedom in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The freedom to religious beliefs is one of the basic rights of
Chinese citizens provided for by the Constitution and protected by
laws," said Zeng Jianhui, chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Zeng, who led a seven-member NPC delegation on a two-week visit
to the United States, told reporters that accusations about China'
s religious situation in the 2000 Report on International
Religious Freedom by the U.S. State Department are not born out by
facts.
</P>
<P>
He said in 1949 when the People's Republic of China was founded,
there were only 700,000 believers in Christianity and now the
number of believers has increased to 10 million.
</P>
<P>
Believers in Catholicism have also been registering an annual
increase of 50,000 in recent years, he added.
</P>
<P>
In fact, all the major five religions in China have developed
over the past years and followers can conducted religious
activities which are protected by laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, religious believers must abide by the Constitution
and laws as other citizens," he said, adding that violations of
laws under the name or pretext of religion should not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese NPC delegation arrived in the United States on
September 9, at the invitation of the U.S. Institute of
Representative Government.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese lawmakers have met with dozens of U.S. congressmen
over the past few days to exchange views on issues of mutual
concern.

<HEADLINE> Canada Announces Support for War-Affected Rwandan Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada contributed 5 million
Canadian dollars (about 3.4 million U.S. dollars) to Rwanda on
Thursday, bringing its total support for the African country to
145 million dollars (about 98 million U.S. dollars) since the 1994
genocide.
</P>
<P>
The latest contribution by the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) is aimed at building vocational training
centers for Rwandan students aged between 14 and 18 years,
Canadian officials said.
</P>
<P>
The support "will help Rwandan youth that are currently not in
school to receive vocational training and to make a meaningful
contribution toward the reconstruction of their society," said
Maria Minna of the Canadian International Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy also expressed support
for Rwanda's efforts to restore the rule of law and national
reconciliation policy.
</P>
<P>
"Canada remains concerned about Rwanda's economic fragility,"
he said. "we are pursuing aid programs to meet fundamental human
needs, especially those of women and children."
</P>
<P>
Canada offered its new contribution in Winnipeg, where a week-
long International Conference on War-Affected Children is being
held.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Truckers Ends Blockades at Midnight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three truckers' unions had accepted a package of measures
proposed by the government to help offset recent fuel cost rises.
They agreed to end the blockades before midnight. Their members
are now withdrawing from motorways, ports, border crossings, oil
depots and gas stations.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure we'll pull out all blockades before midnight tonight,
" said Stefan Adriaens, president of the hardline French-speaking
Professional Road Transport Union (UPTR). He added that his union
had to withdraw because they felt pressure though they did not
sign the agreement with the government.
</P>
<P>
Two other transport unions, primarily representing truckers
from Belgium's Flemish-speaking north, said earlier that they had
signed the agreement with government officials on the package -- a
mix of road tax cuts and lower insurance and social charges.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt welcomed the agreement
and expressed his satisfaction, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the prime minister conveyed an ultimatum to force the
truckers to end the blockades and "stop holding the nation to
ransom."
</P>
<P>
Truckers reacted to news of the deal by sounding their klaxons,
cheering and clapping in central Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The decision to lift the blockades came several hours after
truck drivers in Britain called off nationwide protests that
prompted panic buying and emptied gas stations.

<HEADLINE> Meeting Between S. Africa and Burundi Rebel Group Adjourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A meeting between South
African Deputy President Jacob Zuma and the leadership of a
Burundian main rebel group was adjourned in Pretoria Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting, which was intended to pave the way for cease-fire
negotiations in Kenya next week, ended inconclusively because of
the nature of the broader issues raised during deliberations," an
official close to the talks said after the close-door meeting had
lasted for four hours.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that the discussions were frank and open...and
I think they will bear fruit," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Senior field officers of the Palipehutu-Forces of National
Liberation (FNL) from Burundi are attending the meeting. The FNL
and its rival, the Forces for Defense of Democracy, have been
fighting the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army since 1993 in a civil
war that has left 200,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Hutus make up the majority of Burundi's population, but the
minority Tutsis control the government, the military and the
economy.

Several behind-the-scene meetings have been held in South
Africa in the past few days to lay groundwork for the final cease-

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Warns of Grave Consequences of NMD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Once NMD is deployed, the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-
Ballistic Missile Systems (ABM Treaty) will be dead in essence,"
Chinese Ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament (CD) Hu Xiaodi
said at the CD plenary.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation has stated in explicit terms that if the
United States violates or pulls out of the ABM Treaty, it will be
forced to withdraw from a series of agreements and treaties in the
field of arms control and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"To seek missile defense capability protecting the whole
territory is tantamount to seeking unilateral absolute security so
as to gain absolute freedom in using or threatening to use force
in international relations," Hu warned. "As a result, the
blackmail of nuclear war will likely loom again and the
international situation will become turbulent and unstable."
</P>
<P>
What's more, Hu said, NMD will seriously obstruct arms control
and disarmament process and may lead to a new arms race. It will
be detrimental to multilateral arms control and disarmament
process.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador said that NMD would also disrupt
international efforts of non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
"Non-nuclear-weapon states regard nuclear disarmament by
nuclear-weapon states as the prime prerequisite for them to honor
their commitment to stay non-nuclear," he said. "As NMD will
reverse the process of nuclear disarmament, it will inevitably
shake non-proliferation to its foundation."
</P>
<P>
In this way, NMD will sow mistrust and discord among many
countries, which will in turn affect adversely their cooperation
on non-proliferation, Hu said. Furthermore, as missile defense
program proceeds, there will be proliferation of sophisticated
missile defense systems to other countries and regions, resulting
in de facto proliferation of advanced missile technology.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are strongly against NMD. In a joint statement
in July, the leaders of the two countries stressed that the plan
to establish NMD prohibited by the ABM Treaty is a cause of
profound concern. The statement has been distributed to the CD
member states as an official document.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the implementation of the NMD plan would have
the gravest adverse consequences for the security not only for
China, Russia and other states, but also for that of the United
States itself and for the global strategic stability, the Chinese
ambassador urged the international community to continue to give
serious attention to the perilous development and take necessary
measures to halt it.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Consent Vital for U.N. Mission Dispatching: China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China said the U.N.
Security Council should first have the consent of the Indonesian
government if it intends to send a mission there to discuss the
killing of three U.N. staff in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations
Shen Guofang told Xinhua Thursday that China is not against
sending such a mission if the mission is sent to help Indonesia
and prior consent is obtained from the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the Chinese representative said, such a move on the
part of the council would weaken the authority of the Indonesian
government and its ability to put the situation under control.
</P>
<P>
He added that sending a mission without prior consent may
induce hostility and indignation of the Indonesian people toward
the United Nations and adversely affect the work of the U.N. staff
there in the future.
</P>
<P>
Only when a mission is sent with Indonesia's prior consent can
such a move achieve the expected results, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that as an Asian country and Indonesia's neighbor,
China is very concerned about the situation in West Timor. But
China is equally concerned about the political stability in
Indonesia and does not want to see any turbulence stemming from a
Security Council move.
</P>
<P>
On September 6, a group of militiamen in West Timor attacked
the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in
Atambua, West Timor, where some 100,000 East Timor refugees had
been staying since the U.N.-brokered referendum in August 1999 on
the future of East Timor, which turned to be in favor of
independence.
</P>
<P>
Strongly condemning the incident, the Security Council decided
on September 8 to dispatch a mission as soon as possible to
discuss the implementation of a council resolution which requires
Indonesia to disband the militia in the region.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has rejected the sending of a mission on the grounds
that the government was already trying to respond positively to
the resolution by disbanding and disarming the militia.
</P>
<P>
An Indonesian government envoy is expected to be in New York
this weekend to inform the council of his country's position on
the issue.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Blasts Israel for "Intransigent Positions" on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement was contained in the speech delivered by Nizar
Obaid Madani, Saudi Arabia's assistant minister of foreign affairs,
at the general debate of the 55th General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
"In our region, Israel continues to take intransigent positions
and is not responding to the requirements for peace," he said. "
This became evident during the last talks at Camp David where the
Israeli side insisted on maintaining positions that are
diametrically opposed" to the principles of peace, which were
accepted by both Israel and Palestine and contained in the
relevant U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is making a big mistake if it believes that the peace
process can proceed forward with total disregard to the legitimate
rights of the Palestinians to return to their homeland and
establish their own independent state with Al-Quds Al-Shareef (
Jerusalem) as its capital," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Al-Quds Al-Shareef is an integral part of the occupied
territories," he said. "Moreover, a comprehensive peace cannot be
achieved without Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan
Heights to the June 4, 1967 line."
</P>
<P>
The assistant minister made the statement as the United States
began a new intensive phase of mediations between Israelis and
Palestinians in New York Thursday in a rush to clinch a peace deal
within a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
The key meetings on Thursday will take place between U.S.
Middle East envoy Dennis Ross and two Palestinians, Saeb Erekat
and Mohammad Dahlan, and then between Ben-Ami and U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright over dinner.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak met over 15 days at the U.S.
presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland in July, but broke
up without a deal.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle to an agreement has been the dispute over who
should have sovereignty over various parts of Jerusalem's old city,
site of places holy to Jews, Moslems and Christians.

<HEADLINE> Albright Sees U.N. Resolution 1284 Road Map for Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Maintaining U.S. hard-
line on Iraq, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on
Thursday that U.N. Resolution 1284 is the road map for Iraq to
follow to get out of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference at the U.N. headquarters in
New York, Albright, who is here attending the 55th session of the
United Nations General Assembly, said that Resolution 1284 was
adopted by the U.N. Security Council through long and hard
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It is binding and must be abided by, she said.
</P>
<P>
The bottomline is that Iraq complies with this resolution and
fulfill its obligations, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
To get out of the sanctions, Iraq has to pick up the key in the
table which is the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) led by Hans Blix, she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that the international community must continue to
work to ease the hardships faced by the Iraqi people, and it must
also defend the integrity and authority of this institution at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking to the press, Albright on Tuesday ruled out the
use of force to try to make Iraq let U.N. arms inspectors to
resume their work.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted Resolution 1284 in December 1999,
which established a new U.N. weapons inspection regime for Iraq
called UNMOVIC to replace the United Nations Special Commission in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspection has been suspended since the U.S.-led
military strikes against Iraq in December 1998. Iraq has
reiterated that lifting sanctions is the precondition for U.N.
weapons inspectors to return.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions since its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions cannot be lifted until Iraq is
clarified to be free from weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Disbursement of 399 Million U.S. Dollars to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The funds constitute the second installment in a three-year IMF
credit for Jakarta worth five billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
IMF First Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer said in a
statement that Indonesia's economic growth was likely to reach the
government's target of 3-4 percent this year. But he warned that "
the emerging recovery could quickly stall if market confidence
does not take root."
</P>
<P>
The IMF approved 12 billion dollars in loans to Indonesia
during the world economic crisis of 1997-99, paid out some 10
billion dollars and then topped that loan up and transformed it
into a three-year 5-billion-dollar credit.
</P>
<P>
"With the continued strong support of the international
community and resolute economic and political leadership in
Indonesia, the strengthening of Indonesia's economic reform
program should lead to improvement in Indonesia's medium-term
economic outlook," Fisher said.

the president said it was very difficult to reconcile the
government's positions "that one day he's a terrible risk to the
national security and the next day they're making a plea agreement
for an offense far more modest than what had been alleged."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can justify in retrospect keeping a person
in jail without bail when you're prepared to make that kind of
agreement," he said.

<P>
The 60-year-old Lee, who was jailed for nine months on 59
charges of mishandling secrets, was set free Wednesday under a
plea agreement with the prosecutors.

<HEADLINE> Islamist Sentenced for Endangering Egypt's Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The leader of an unknown
Islamist group was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor Thursday on
charges of threatening Egypt's social peace and stability and
violation of Islam by marrying three sisters.
</P>
<P>
The state security court found Sayed al-Saftawy, 43, and his
followers guilty of calling for the suspension of the constitution,
refusing to cooperate with state institutions and violating civil
liberties, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Saftawy had also urged the members of the unnamed group to
follow his marital example, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Muslims' holy book, the Koran, allows a man to have four wives
as long as none of them are sisters. He can marry a wife's sister
only if the wife has died.
</P>
<P>
The court also sentenced nine of the group members, whose total
number was not given, to hard labor ranging from one year to 15
years, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Saftawy and his accomplices were arrested in October 1999 in

<P>
RIYADH, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi, who hijacked a
Qatari Airways passenger plane Thursday and later forced the jet to
land in northern Saudi Arabia, will be repatriated to Qatar, said a
Saudi prince.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari authorities will send a security team on a private
plane to get the hijacker back, Prince Abdul-Aziz Bin Saad Abdul-
Aziz, deputy emir of Ha'fl Region told reporters. The hijacker was
only identified as an Iraqi national and his name was not known.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari Airways Airbus 330 was hijacked by the Iraqi
national, armed with a knife, on its way from Qatari capital of
Doha to Jordan. The hijacker forced the jet, carrying 133
passengers and 11 crew, to land hours later at the Ha'fl airport,
700 kilometers north of the Saudi capital Riyadh, and turned
himself in to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
The plane has shortly taken off again from Ha'fl airport and
headed to its destination Amman.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources said the hijacker was probably a
frustrated Iraqi job-seeker and he was reported to refused to
return to Iraq, which has been under a sweeping U.N. embargo for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Reports said a large number of Iraqis have recently been to
Qatar in a bid to find jobs, but many failed.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a Qatari airliner has been hijacked
since the Qatari Airways was established in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Consequences of NATO Aggression on Yugoslavia Continues: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Consequences of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) aggression on Yugoslavia are
continuing to endanger lives and health of the population of
Kosovo and Metohija and Yugoslavia as a whole, said Yugoslavian
Charge d'affairs Dusan Zupan here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Zupan said the most hazardous
consequences are those of cluster bombs and depleted uranium used
in the 1999 aggression, during which 25,200 sorties were flown and
25,000 tons of explosives were dropped.
</P>
<P>
The danger is not limited only to the population of the
province of Kosovo and Metohija or the whole country, he said,
noting that U.N. staff members coming from different countries are
also exposed.
</P>
<P>
"I can not tell you specifically whether already there are
causalities among Zambian policemen, who were sent to that country.
I am informed that many soldiers and policemen, mainly from
Western countries are suffering from disease known as Gulf
syndrome," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Many of them died, but you can hardly find such information in
Western media," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, although there are also reports of
Iraqi civilians suffering from the radiation, but that was mainly
in the desert. Kosovo and Yugoslavia have a much bigger density of
population and even more victims will appear among civilians in
years to come, he said.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the use of such kind of ammunition as a violation
of the basic principles of international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
There is not any justification for the use of weapons at all,
and even less for the use of chemical, biological and radioactive
weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is a crime by all standards, not only when such weapons are
used against military personnel, but also and especially when
civilians are targets and victims, he added.

<HEADLINE> Libya Makes Recommendations on Aims of U.N. Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Libya Thursday put
forward recommendations on aims of the ongoing U.N. reform, saying
that "the responsibility for success or failure in this respect
must be ultimately a joint responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Libyan Foreign Minister Abdurrahman Shalghem told the general
debate of the 55th General Assembly session, which began here
Tuesday morning, that his country wishes to contribute to the idea
on what should be achieved in reforming the world body.
</P>
<P>
First, work should be done to strengthen the role of the
General Assembly so that it becomes the authority responsible for
determining and deciding the conditions which must be deemed as
truly threatening to international peace and security, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The General Assembly should also approve the resolutions
adopted by the Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
Second, efforts should be made to restructure the Security
Council in order to ensure fair geographical representation in its
membership, and equity for African, Asian, and Latin American
states which are not fairly represented in the membership of the
council, he said.
</P>
<P>
Third, efforts should be taken to improve the ways and methods
by which the Security Council conducts its work in order to make
its activities more transparent, he said. "Its rules of procedures
should also be reviewed."
</P>
<P>
The world is facing the challenges of regional wars and
conflicts, diseases such as cancer, malaria and AIDS, and negative
impact of globalization on most developing countries, he said. "
The United Nations, in its capacity as an instrument and reference
authority for all, should perform a central role in dealing with
these problems."

<HEADLINE> Boeing Announces Enhancements on Popular 737 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Boeing announced Thursday
enhancements to the rudder control system of its popular 737
twinjet as a result of work done in cooperation with the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB).
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after the FAA released the final
report on a year-long review of the 737 flight control system. The
review, conducted after two Boeing 737 crashes in 1991 and 1994,
was focused on examining the rudder mechanism of the world's most
widely used jet.
</P>
<P>
Boeing said that the enhancements involve simplifying flight
crew procedures, increasing maintenance oversight and modifying
the rudder control system. "We think these enhancements will
improve an airplane that already has proven itself in more than
100 million hours of flight," the Seattle-based airplane
manufacturer said.
</P>
<P>
The NTSB has recommended that the 737 rudder power control unit
be made "reliably redundant." To this, Boeing said that while the
existing system is redundant and has proven itself reliable, it
has developed a new concept that eliminates the dual concentric
valve that has been the subject of concerns in the past. "It makes
a major change to the system," the company said, "however, it is
based on proven current technology, will fit within the existing
airplane structure and will be relatively simple to retrofit into
the fleet."
</P>
<P>
Boeing said that customers will be formally notified of the
proposed crew procedure and maintenance changes in the near future.
The proposed rudder modifications will be discussed with the
airlines, suppliers and the FAA, Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
The company stressed the excellent safety record of its 737. As
of July 31, Boeing had announced 4,736 orders for 737s and had
delivered 3,740 to 300 operators in more than 100 countries.

<HEADLINE> Jamaica Backs U.N. Effort to Address Root Causes of Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement came as Foreign Minister Paul Robertson of
Jamaica took the floor at the general debate of the 55th General
Assembly session, which kicked off here on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We need to place more emphasis on conflict prevention, rather
than waiting until conflicts spiral out of control," he said. "
Jamaica therefore strongly supports the formulation of a
comprehensive U.N. strategy to address the root causes of conflict,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is time that we acknowledge that economic deprivation and
social injustice leads to political and economic instability," he
said. "Effective conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peace
building must incorporate a component for development, and provide
for the strengthening of civil institutions, particularly in post-
conflict reconstruction."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations' role as defender of international peace
and security has undergone major transformation in the past decade,
" he said. "As inter-state tensions dissolved with the end of the
Cold War, civil conflicts developed in Africa, Asia and Eastern
Europe to take their place."
</P>
<P>
Africa has the most conflicts in the world, which is largely
characterized by intrastate conflicts, rather than the inter-state
ones during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
On the international trade, he said, "small countries
attempting to compete effectively in the international trading
system are just as vulnerable."
</P>
<P>
"There is need for urgent review of the inequities in the
global trading system whereby selective application of the
regulations permits developed countries to maintain protectionist
policies and subsidies that work against developing country
exports, while stripping the more vulnerable of preferential
market access," he said.

LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Many fuel protesters across
Britain over the high fuel cost began dismantling their blockades
on Thursday, saying they had made their point and wanted to avoid
harming the public.
</P>
<P>
But motorists were being warned it could be several days before
petrol supplies return to normal levels despite the ending of
blockades at refineries around the country.
</P>
<P>
As tankers started leaving refineries, some oil companies
announced they were putting up their prices. But hours later one
company, Esso, dropped prices again, following a meeting with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair where he urged them to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
Some protesters had threaten to re-impose their blockades when
the news of a hike in the prices of unleaded petrol and diesel was
announced.
</P>
<P>
The oil giant Shell has 150 of its 175 tankers on the move and
says it is trying to put on extra shifts and is paying overtime to
increase petrol deliveries.
</P>
<P>
They are aiming to make 250 deliveries on Thursday as opposed
to a normal daily delivery total of 650.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Warns of Grave Consequences of NMD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The development and deployment
of the national missile defense system (NMD) by the United States
will undermine global strategic balance and stability and threaten
international peace and stability, a Chinese official said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Once NMD is deployed, the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-
Ballistic Missile Systems (ABM Treaty) will be dead in essence,"
said Chinese Ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament (CD) Hu
Xiaodi at the CD plenary.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation has stated in explicit terms that if the
United States violates or pulls out of the ABM treaty, it will be
forced to withdraw from a series of agreements and treaties in the
field of arms control and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"To seek missile defense capability protecting the whole
territory is tantamount to seeking unilateral absolute security so
as to gain absolute freedom in using or threatening to use force
in international relations," Hu warned. "As a result, the
blackmail of nuclear war will likely loom again and the
international situation will become turbulent and unstable."
</P>
<P>
What's more, Hu said, NMD will seriously obstruct arms control
and disarmament process and may lead to a new arms race. It will
be detrimental to multilateral arms control and disarmament
process.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador said that NMD would also disrupt
international efforts of non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
"Non-nuclear-weapon states regard nuclear disarmament by
nuclear-weapon states as the prime prerequisite for them to honor
their commitment to stay non-nuclear," he said. "As NMD will
reverse the process of nuclear disarmament, it will inevitably
shake non-proliferation to its foundation."
</P>
<P>
In this way, NMD will sow mistrust and discord among many
countries, which will in turn affect adversely their cooperation
on non-proliferation, Hu said. Furthermore, as missile defense
program proceeds, there will be proliferation of sophisticated
missile defense systems to other countries and regions, resulting
in de facto proliferation of advanced missile technology.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are strongly against NMD. In a joint statement
in July, the leaders of the two countries stressed that the plan
to establish NMD prohibited by the ABM treaty is a cause of
profound concern. The statement has been distributed to the CD
member states as an official document.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the implementation of the NMD plan would have
the gravest adverse consequences for the security not only for
China, Russia and other states, but also for that of the United
States itself and for the global strategic stability, the Chinese
ambassador urged the international community to continue to give
serious attention to the perilous development and take necessary
measures to halt it.

<HEADLINE> Arab-African Parliamentarians Support Palestinian Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Peace and security in the Middle
East cannot be restored without the return of East Jerusalem to the
Palestinian sovereignty, said a final statement issued here
Thursday at the conclusion of the 9th Arab-African Parliamentary
Conference.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is the core of the Israeli-Palestinian
issue, which has attracted great attention from Arab and African
countries, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, opened here Tuesday with the participation of 47
Arab and African parliamentarians, urged the United Nations to stop
Israel from violating the geographical and legal status of the
Palestinian territories in general and East Jerusalem in
particular.
</P>
<P>
It also called on Israel to respect relevant U.N. resolutions,
notably U.N. Security Council Resolution 446 which calls on Israel
to stop its Jewish settlement activities as they are detrimental to
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the meeting called on all countries, especially the
U.S., not to move their embassies in Israel to Jerusalem since such
a step violates all U.N. resolutions issued in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged all Arab and African countries to offer all
kinds of support to the Palestinian people in their struggle to
achieve their national rights, including the right of Palestinian
refugees to return home and get appropriate compensations under the
U.N. resolution 194 and the creation of an independent state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
It called on the international community to support the
Palestinian statehood once it is declared by the Palestinian
leadership.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Central Council (PCC) decided on Sunday to
postpone the statehood declaration originally set for Wednesday so
as to give Israeli-Palestinian peace talks more time to succeed.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Repatriate Illegal Immigrants to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government is
making effort to repatriate to Lebanon 266 illegal immigrants, who
were saved from drowning Wednesday when their boat sank off western
Cyprus, local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The boat, which carried mainly Iranians and Kurds, was said to
have set off from Lebanon for Italy.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Interior Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou Thursday
called in Lebanese charge d'affaires in Nicosia Constantin Tabet to
ask him to inform the Lebanese authorities on the issue and ask
them to enforce a bilateral agreement that envisages that "illegal
immigrants arriving on the shores of one country from the other,
must return to the country they came from after this fact has been
established and accepted."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Cypriot government does pay attention to the
humanitarian aspects of the issue, he said the illegal immigrants,
many of them are women and children, will remain under police
control until Lebanon responds to the request.
</P>
<P>
Tabet said he will "make the necessary arrangements and contacts
to put an end to this issue which creates problems for Cyprus and
Lebanon," adding that he hopes his government will respond
positively.
</P>
<P>
All the 266 people are now on a large Cyprus ship in the
Limassol port, on the island's southern coast.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Cypriot authorities know the whereabouts of the
boat's captain, Christodoulou said "according to testimonies given,
he abandoned boat at some stage on the way here and disappeared."
</P>
<P>
He added that the illegal immigrants claimed they paid "4,000 U.
S. dollars each to be taken to Italy."
</P>
<P>
Due to the unique geographical location, the Mediterranean
island's shores have been a major transit for illegal immigrants
from the Middle East to European countries. Some seek political
asylum here or abroad and many are conned by foreigners who promise
to take them elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Security Forces Kill 11 Afghan Drug Traffickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces killed
11 Afghan drug traffickers in the heights of Torbat-e Heidarieh in
the eastern province of Khorasan bordering Afghanistan, a local
official announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 11 members of an armed gang of Afghan drug traffickers were
killed in violent clashes with the provincial security forces over
the past few days, said Ali Mohaddesi, the deputy governor of
Torbat-e Heidarieh city, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security forces in the southern Fars Province seized
two tons of narcotics in the past month, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, 1,417 drug addicts and traffickers active in
nine gangs have been arrested in the province, said Brigadier
General Hossein Zoulfaqari.
</P>
<P>
Drug hauls have been very common in Iran as it sits on a major
route for smuggling narcotics from its eastern neighbors of
Afghanistan and Pakistan to the lucrative markets in the Persian
Gulf, Europe and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
In July, Iran closed down 725 kilometers of its borders with
Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, as part of the
stepped-up efforts to fight drug trade.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Majlis (parliament) has also earmarked 200 billion rials
(about 24.4 million U.S. dollars) in credits to block the eastern
borders from drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, 740 drug traffickers and 174 Iranian police officers
were killed in narcotics-related confrontations, according to
government reports.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 40 United Nations
military observers are due to arrive in the Horn of Africa this
weekend to monitor the ceasefire between Ethiopia and Eritrea,
diplomats here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They are part of an advance mission of up to 100 military
observers pledged by the U.N. Security Council in July after the
signing of a peace deal in June to end the two-year-old Ethio-
Eritrean intermittent border conflict.
</P>
<P>
The unarmed U.N. military observers will receive a short period
of training before they are sent to the demilitarized zones at the
end of this month, said a diplomat who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.N. Security Council is considering
to deploy some 4,200 peacekeeping troops along the western,
central and eastern fronts between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The war between the two countries has reportedly claimed tens
of thousands of lives and left more than 1 million people homeless.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Urged to Protect Forest Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Ethiopian Agricultural Research Organization (EARO) has urged
people to take measures to protect forest resources, warning that
150,000 to 200,000 hectares of forest in the country are lost
annually, the Ethiopian Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ever-increasing demand for fuel wood and grazing land were
among the major causes for the rampant deforestation in the
country, forestry research director of the EARO Demel Teketay said.
</P>
<P>
Demel said that the rapidly increasing human and animal
populations growth had also exacerbated the depletion of the
country's forest resources, noting that the natural high forest
resources were vanishing at an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
An official survey shows that the coverage rate of natural
forests in Ethiopia has dropped from 40 percent 100 years ago to
the current some 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the loss of forest resources and vegetation has
resulted in high rates of soil erosion, degradation of water
resources and depletion of biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
Demel stressed the need to formulate appropriate forestry
policies and forge strong organizational setups to avert
deforestation.

LUANDA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fighting in eastern
Angola between government troops and the rebels has triggered
another refugee exodus, pushing some 600 of them across the border
into the neighboring Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are currently in a transit camp in Zambian border
town of Zambezi, waiting to be further transferred to a refugee
center, reported the Portuguese Lusa News Agency on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Free Trade Area on Course: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- An official from the Common
Market For Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) said on Thursday
that plans to introduce the Free Trade Area (FTA) on October 31
this year are still on course, as all of the 11 member countries
that pledged to subscribe to FTA have reaffirmed their commitment.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Assistant Secretary General Sindiso Ngwenya said
although COMESA had gone through some trying times in the last 12
months, it had remained united in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the sixth meeting of the Trade and Customs
Committee that was closed here on Thursday,  Ngwenya said the
meeting saw 11 member states including Zambia reaffirm their
pledges to the FTA.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came in the wake of reports that COMESA, which has
been reduced to 20 member states after the departure of Tanzania,
is seriously divided over the FTA which is scheduled to come into
effect on October 31.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania claimed that it has withdrawn from COMESA to protect
its manufacturing industry and it have no capacity to handle the
competition that is expected to come with the FTA. But its
departure is being described by FTA critics as a sign of division
in COMESA over the FTA.
</P>
<P>
Eleven member states at the Mauritius heads of state summit
earlier this year pledged to subscribe to the FTA after the heads
of state summit in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Ngwenya said the FTA should not be looked at as the total
removal of tariffs to the detriment of member states but rather
the removal of all trade barriers to improve intra regional trade.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Police Raid Opposition Party Offices for Firearms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Police Thursday raided Harare
offices of Zimbabwe's opposition party Movement for Democratic
Change (MDC), but failed to find firearms, as they claimed the MDC
had illegally possessed.
</P>
<P>
The country's armed police raided the MDC's three offices with
search warrants authorizing them to confiscate arms such as
grenades, pistols, rifles and tear bombs, reported the Zimbabwe
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The police also took away John Nkatazo and Socks Ncube, two of
the MDC's high-ranking officials, but dropped no charges against
them.
</P>
<P>
After two hours' searching in vain for the alleged firearms,
the police wanted to seize some of the MDC's documents, which was
resisted by the party's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
A heated argument ensued when the MDC's shadow minister of
justice David Coltart arrived at the offices, saying the police
had no reasonable grounds for raiding his party's offices. But the
police said they were acting on information and an affidavit
supporting allegation of the arms possession.
</P>
<P>
The MDC Secretary-general Welshman Ncube later commented that
he was saddened, though not shocked by the event.
</P>
<P>
He accused the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front of consistently abusing its power and using "violence and
unlawful means to maintain its hold on power", according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The raid came two days after the MDC Headquarters in Harare
were attacked by bomb blasts.

<HEADLINE> Renewal of Accord on Forming Guinea-Bissau's Coalition Govt Possible: RGB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Guinea-Bissau Resistance (RGB),
the junior partner of the country's just-broken coalition
government, has said that renewal of the accord on forming the
coalition government with the ruling Social Renovation Party (PRS)
was possible, according to reports reaching here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A source with RGB made the remarks on Wednesday, as the two
parties continued their negotiations with an aim to restore the
coalition agreement that broke down last week, when all the five
RGB members of the coalition government were dismissed by Prime
Minister Caetano Intchama, said the reports issued by the
Portuguese Lusa News Agency.
</P>
<P>
According to the source without being identified, "despite
several unspecified points of contention", it is possible for the
two parties to renew the accord on forming the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the RGB insisted that the differences do not include
demands to replace the country's Prime Minister Caetano Intchama,
as reported in the local press.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, RGB leader Helder Vaz met for several hours with
President Kumba Iala, who has resigned as PRS leader after he took
office in February but continues to wield influence in the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
The PRS won most seats, but not a majority, in the legislative
elections held in November, 1999. Then, the PRS signed an accord
with the second largest party RGB on forming a coalition
government, and thus obtained a majority in the parliament.
Helder Vaz, former minister of Economy and Regional Development,
is also among the five ministers dismissed by Intchama.

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Resume Flights to Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's prominent airway
company SABENA Thursday announced to resume on October 30 flights
to Burundi's capital Bujumbura after five years of link suspension,
Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The airlines made the decision apparently in the light of a
possible end in the near future of the country's seven-year civil
war.
</P>
<P>
SABENA suspended its flights to Bujumbura on August 3, 1996 as
part of the international sanctions against a coup launched by
incumbent Burundian President Pierre Buyoya. The sanctions were
lifted in December of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The coup plunged the country into a civil war, which has taken
lives of at least 200,000 people by far.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by former South African president Nelson Mandela, 13
of the 19 Burundian negotiating parties signed a peace agreement
in the Tanzanian northern town of Arusha on August 28 this year
aimed to end the bloody war in the country.
</P>
<P>
Later, the number of the signatories increased to 16, with the
remaining three parties having undertaken to sign the political
accord on September 20 in Nairobi, Kenya without reservations,
thus giving promising expectations for the ending of the war.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Fall 0.2 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. wholesale prices fell
0.2 percent in August, the first decline in four months, as
falling prices for gasoline and children's clothes more than
offset rising prices for cigarettes and home heating oil, the
Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the Producer Price Index, which measures
inflation pressures before they reach consumers, came after a flat
reading in July.
</P>
<P>
In August, energy prices fell 0.2 percent after a sharp 0.7
percent drop in July. A 2.8 percent decline in gasoline prices
helped outweigh higher prices for home heating oil and residential
electric power, which rose 2 percent and 1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Food prices fell 0.7 percent in August, the best showing in
more than a year. Falling prices for fruits, pork and dairy
products outweighed rising prices for eggs and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the "core"
rate of inflation at the wholesale level rose for the second
straight month by a tiny 0.1 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times in the
last 15 months to slow the economy and keep inflation under
control. With a spate of recent economic reports showing signs of
moderating economic growth, economists are growing increasingly
optimistic that the central bank may be done raising rates this
year.
</P>
<P>
Two other reports Thursday showed more evidence of a cooling
economy.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales rose just 0.2 percent in August in line with
analysts' expectations, the Commerce Department said. And, the
number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits
rose last week to the highest level since January 1999, suggesting
that the hot labor market is softening a bit. Claims rose by a
seasonally adjusted 13,000 to 324,000, the Labor Department said.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, wholesale prices have been rising at an
annual rate of 3.2 percent, compared with a 3 percent gain for all
of 1999. The pickup in this year's wholesale prices largely
reflects rising energy costs.

<HEADLINE> Russia's GDP Growth Hits Record High in First Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The growth of Russia's gross
domestic product (GDP) in the first half of this year reached 7.3
percent, a best record in the latest 10 years, Russian Premier
Mikhail Kasyanov said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months, the country's industrial
production jumped 10.3 percent, federal revenues, including non-
tax revenues, were collected at the highest rates in a decade and
amounted to over 17 percent of the GDP. Gold and currency reserves
of the central bank were also on the rise, Kasyanov told a cabinet
meeting on the execution of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
Tax revenues, especially from corporate profit tax, rose
dramatically, amounting to almost 11 percent of the GDP with
profit tax contributing 17 percent of all tax revenues. "Earlier,
this tax amounted to from 7 to a maximum 9 percent of the general
tax revenues," Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
He gave high marks to economic performance in the first half of
the year and said the tendency is indicative of "further progress"
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister
Alexei Kudrin told a Tuesday conference titled "Russia: New Era
Opportunities" in Moscow that the country's economic growth in the
second half of 2000 will slow down to about 5 percent as the
efficiency of ruble's devaluation has exhausted.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will continue the policy of repaying
debts, particularly foreign debts, as their volume reached a
critical mark.
</P>
<P>
The government will use the situation of high oil prices in the
world market to cut down the debts, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
In connection with this outlook, Kasyanov stressed Thursday
that in order to maintain the positive economic tendencies the
cabinet will step up restructuring branches of the industry,
particularly those sectors of the national economy with little
effectiveness, such as agriculture where over 50 percent of
enterprises show loss.

<HEADLINE> Greek Government Urged Not to Back Annan's Cyprus Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warning that the solution planned for the Cyprus issue was
clearly one of partition, the KKE said that Annan's controversial
statement only served to confirm appraisals that events were
leading to complete burial of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The party called on the Greek government led by Costas Simitis
to declare its position that it would not support the developments
being planned on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
There could be no issue of recognition of a separate Turkish
Cypriot state and the framework Greece recognizes for a just and
viable solution of the Cyprus problem was founded on the U.N.
Security Council resolutions, the political party said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and the Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of the U.N.-sponsored indirect talks between
Cyprus' two communities opened Tuesday afternoon at the U.N.
headquarters in New York, and Annan said in his statement that the
equal status of the two sides in the eastern Mediterranean island
must be clearly recognized.
</P>
<P>
As for the U.N. chief's statement, the Greek government has not
made known its position, only stating that the priority was to
open meaningful negotiations for the solution of the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
As a major support of Cyprus, Athens and Nicosia have signed a
joint defense agreement.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Legislator Meets Russian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng
met here Thursday with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov and
discussed with him bilateral ties, economic and trade cooperation
and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National
People's Congress, is here on a nine-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
He said China and Russia, as neighboring powers with identical
or similar views on many issues in international affairs, should
deepen their cooperation in politics, economy, science and
technology and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov commended Li for his contributions over the years to
the development of bilateral cooperation as China's top legislator
and premier.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Sino-Russian strategic partnership of cooperation
conforms to their fundamental interests. He expressed the hope
that the two sides would achieve more substantial results in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov said the development of bilateral political ties has
laid a sound foundation for economic and trade cooperation, which
should become more active.
</P>
<P>
He said he is looking forward to meeting Chinese Vice-Premier
Li Lanqing shortly in Moscow and meeting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji in Beijing later this year.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Chinese side would take concrete steps implementing
the agreements reached recently in Beijing by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides should help push forward the direct
cooperation between the enterprises and the various regions of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said China is implementing the strategy of developing its
western regions, and Russian enterprises are welcome to
participate in the regions' infrastructure construction.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Warn of Rise in Dangerous Radiation in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The process by which the ozone layer got thinner had started 10
days earlier than usual this year while the "ozone hole" now
spanned an area more than two and a half times the size of Europe,
the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) quoted the director of
the university's Atmospheric Physics Laboratory, Christos Zerefos,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
For Greece in particular, data collected by the university's
Ozone Mapping Center showed that the ozone layer had thinned by 3-
4 percent over the past decade, and this had led to an 8 percent
increase in dangerous solar radiation.
</P>
<P>
Experts advise avoiding extending exposure to sunlight since it
may lead to increase risk of skin cancer, catarracts and premature
skin aging.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the ozone layer will not recover to pre-
ozone hole levels before 2050.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's GDP Up 5.3 Percent in January-August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The real gross domestic product
(GDP) of Ukraine during the first eight months of this year
increased by 5.3 percent over the same period of 1999, the State
Statistics Committee (SSC) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the SSC, a positive tendency of output growth was
observed in all the leading sectors. In particular, the industry
output grew 12 percent over the year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
In addition, agriculture output was up 0.2 percent, the first
growth since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Ministry predicted that the pace of GDP growth
will decrease in the last months of the current year and will make
2.8 percent in 2000 as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Ukraine's GDP was down 0.4 percent. The government
expects a 4 percent GDP growth in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan Opium Production Down: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The area under opium poppy cultivation in the 2000 season
stands at 82,172 hectares, 10 percent down from the 90,983 ha in
1999, Executive Director of the U.N. Office for Drug Control and
Crime Prevention (ODCCP) Pino Arlacchi announced in New York.
</P>
<P>
The entire 2000 crop of fresh opium is estimated at 98 million
U.S. dollars, valued at some 30 dollars a kilogram, which is
almost 50 percent less than the 1999 level, Arlacchi said, citing
the findings of the U.N. annual opium poppy survey for Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the protracted drought throughout
Afghanistan has had significant impact on the yield of the 2000
harvest.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the alternative development program
coupled with commitment by authorities to eliminate cultivation of
illicit crops can significantly help reduce poppy production, as
the practice of U.N. target districts of Qandahar has suggested.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) has since 1994 conducted
the annual survey in response to the alarming increase in poppy
cultivation in Afghanistan in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
However, the country is still the largest opium producer in the
world today, the U.N. agency said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Decides to Freeze Retail Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The freeze, which will put into effect as of midnight Thursday,
was decided late Wednesday at a meeting attended by Greece's
Development Minister Nikos Christodoulakis and representatives of
petrol companies, gas station owners and refineries.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulakis said Thursday that fuel price hikes in Europe
had created strong pressure on production activity, but he
believed that in Greece, they, with the cooperation of all sides
concerned, would find ways of minimizing those pressures and
overcoming the problem with the least possible consequences.
</P>
<P>
He added that his ministry had launched an extensive, multi-
faceted collaboration with all the sides involved in the refining,
trade and distribution of fuel.
</P>
<P>
World fuel prices have reportedly increased by 50 percent in
the past year and petroleum companies have been purchasing petrol
at a cost increased by 250 percent.
</P>
<P>
As for the soaring oil and U.S. dollar prices, Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis has voiced his concern, stressing that
such situation must normalize as quickly as possible because it
can become even harder.

<HEADLINE> Russia May Give Up Salvage of Sunken Sub Crew Bodies: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Premier Ilya
Klebanov said Thursday that retrieving the crew bodies in the
nuclear submarine "Kursk" sinking in the Barents Sea on August 12
will be "a very difficult and dangerous technical job" and the
government may abandon the salvage plan.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov, also head of a governmental commission in charge of
investigating the sub tragedy, told reporters that the feasibility
of evacuating the sailors' remains must be discussed with their
families. "As far as we understand, we cannot find anyone in the
front four sections of the Kursk (which were torn open by
explosions in the accident), and most of the submarine crew was
there at the moment of the catastrophe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Just getting at the dead crew members will be very difficult in
technical viewpoint and be very dangerous, Klebanov noted. It was
initially planned that Norwegian divers who helped Russia make
sure the death of the crew would do the retrieval themselves, but
they had to abandon the idea later and ask Russian divers to join
them, thinking of the high danger of this task.
</P>
<P>
It is also very hard to determine where the dead sailors are,
so the issue whether the bodies should be recovered or not is
needed to be discussed with the kin of the dead, said Klebanov.
</P>
<P>
He suggested an international maritime tradition of viewing a
ship-sinking site as a common grave for the sailors. "It is a
generally accepted norm.... But these issues are very important
and any decision must be taken in full coordination with the
families of the deceased," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov rejected the views of some experts who say that silt
will get into the submarine through the holes to be cut in its
hull, making it impossible to raise the sub to the surface in the
future.
</P>
<P>
"A project worked out by the Rubin design bureau and the
Norwegian specialists will ensure the holes to be sealed after the
operation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Calls for Lifting U.N. Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Belarus strongly endorsed
Baghdad's demands that the crippling U.N. sanctions on Iraq be
lifted, said a visiting Belarussian official here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Belarus will continue to make efforts to get the decade-old
sanctions lifted and halt Iraqi people's plight, said Vladimir
Zamtalin, envoy of Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
Zamtalin made the pledge after meeting with Iraqi Deputy
Minister of Finance Hasan Abdul Munem, the official Iraqi News
Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The INA report said that Zamtalin also expressed the desire to
resume civil flights between the two countries, but it did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two sides signed a cooperation agreement
which was described by Munem as "the cornerstone for strengthening
bilateral cooperation between the two friendly countries."
</P>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein on Tuesday met with Zamtalin who
conveyed him a letter from his Belarussian counterpart, which
touched upon ways of improving bilateral relations in trade,
economic and political domains, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been steadily
improving. Iraqi Finance Minister Hikmet Mizban Ibrahim visited
Belarus in July and held talks with the Belarussian president.
</P>
<P>
"I am stating again our support for the struggle of the Iraqi
people for their independence" from the sanctions, Lukashenko had
said after his meeting with Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which led to the 1991 Gulf War. The sanctions
will not be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors certify that Iraq is
free of weapons of mass destruction and the capability to rebuild
its arsenal.

<HEADLINE> African Trade Ministers to Discuss Free Trade in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Trade ministers of African
countries are scheduled to meet in Cairo next Tuesday to discuss
issues including free trade and economic globalization, the
Egyptian minister of economy and foreign trade said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the importance of the two-day conference, Youssef
Boutros Ghali said that it is aimed at forging a unified African
stance towards the challenges brought by economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also seek ways to carry out the
recommendations made during a meeting in the Nigerian capital of
Abuja in 1992 on creating a common African economic group, Ghali
was quoted as saying by state-run MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to discuss the results of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting in Seattle, the United
States, last December, policies and programs for liberalizing trade
among African countries and the new partnership with the European
Union, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministers will also touch on the results of the 10th
session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
held in Thailand in February and U.S. proposals for trade and
development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Africa's trade ministers last met one year ago in Algeria in
hopes of establishing a common African position ahead of the WTO
meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
The meeting held next week is being organized by Egypt in
cooperation with the Organization of African Unity, the news agency
said.

session, which began here Tuesday morning.

TEHRAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A traffic accident in Iran's
western Lorestan Province on Thursday left at least 11 people
dead and 20 injured, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The accident, which happened on the Khoramabad-Boroujerd road,

Traffic personnel have started an investigation into the cause of
the accident.
</P>
<P>
The provincial security forces announced that some of the
injured are in critical conditions.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, six people were burned to death and
one got injured as a result of a four-vehicle collision Tuesday
night on the Evanaky-Garmsar road in the northern province of
Semnan, the report said.
</P>

According to local security forces, the collision was caused by
overtaking by a mini-van, which hit a truck. Subsequently, a bus
and a car, traveling in the opposite direction, collided with the
two vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents have been on the rise in Iran. A recent survey
conducted in this regard revealed that some 200,000 accidents take

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Global Oil Price Hike Affects People's Life and Economy  of Bangladesh by Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The fall out of global oil
price hike has started affecting the life of Bangladeshi people,
particularly the middle class, and the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh government raised the prices of petroleum products
by about 20 percent in the middle of last month, which chamber
leaders said have already increased the production cost of both
industrial and agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The government also raised the transport fare by around 50
percent on an average as compensation to the transport owners for
fuel price hike.
</P>
<P>
The rise in transport fares has pushed up prices of essential
commodities adding to the miseries of the fixed income group.
</P>
<P>
"We are forced to raise the prices of commodities as their
prices in the wholesale market have been raised," a retailer in a
city's major shopping center said.
</P>
<P>
He said the rise in transport fares has especially shop up the
prices of imported commodities.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh imports about 1.2 million tons of crude oil and 1.8
million tons of petrol and diesel and other petroleum products
annually at a cost of 500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the state-owned Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation
said the corporation will have to spend an additional 175 million
dollars due to the hike in the prices of petroleum products in the
global market, which shot up to 27 dollars a barrel from 19
dollars recently.
</P>
<P>
The monthly magazine of the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce
and Industry said the additional expenditure in oil import will
keep an adverse impact on the country's balance of payment and
will force the government to cut it's development expenditure.
</P>
<P>
It will also influence the country's foreign exchange reserve
which plunged to 1.3 billion dollars from 1.5 billion dollars a
month ago, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
The balance of payment of the country during the first nine
months of the last fiscal year saw a surplus of 164.4 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Raps Japan for Distorting History in Textbooks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Thursday criticized Japan for
distorting history in middle school textbooks, describing their
moves as a "provocation" to the DPRK and other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The history books, for which request for examination is made to
prepare for use in the year 2002, contain matters justifying
Japan's past history of aggression and its militarist policies,
the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
The textbooks describe Japan's military occupation of Korea and
its invasion of Asia as "legitimate acts conducted on the
principle governing international relations" and hardly mentioned
the criminal acts committed by Japanese troops.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they describe the Asian people's struggle against the
invasion as "violations of treaties."
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that Japan is employing these methods to
conceal its history of aggression and justify its criminal past.
It maintains that these moves cannot be tolerated since they
reflect the criminal purpose and intention of Japanese ultra-right
reactionary forces to instill militarist and ultra-nationalist
ideas into Japanese people through middle school textbooks in a
bid to realize Japan's old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-
prosperity Sphere."
</P>
<P>
If Japan really has a willingness to put an end to its
disgraceful past, it should take a sincere approach toward
redeeming itself instead of resorting to deception to distort its
history, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It added that Japan's moves to tamper with its history is an
unpardonable challenge to other Asian countries, including the
DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Inflation Down to 2.5 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada's inflation rate
dropped to 2.5 percent in August from three percent in July, with
the core rate of inflation standing steady at 1.5 percent,
Statistics Canada reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drop largely resulted from a pause in increasing energy
costs, including a 3.5 percent decline in the price of gasoline,
which saw its first consecutive monthly decrease from July since
late 1998.
</P>
<P>
Major inflation contributors, such as higher mortgage costs and
rising prices for restaurants and fresh vegetables, were balanced
by lower prices for vehicles, computer equipment and women's
clothing.
</P>
<P>
But with oil prices rising again this month, local experts
warned that energy costs may soon work their way into the core
rate of inflation, which has been contained between one percent to
three percent by Canada's central bank and is closely watched by
the country's policy makers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday that the 15-member European Union will reduce sugar
production quotas by 498,800 tons in the current 2000-2001
marketing year, which began on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a statement that EU's Sugar Management
Committee has approved a draft regulation on the reduction, which
is necessary for the EU to carry out its commitment to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the predecessor of the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The EU move "bring the (sugar production) quotas to a total of
14,719,786 tons compared to 15,218,586 tons last year."
</P>
<P>
Under the GATT, the EU should limit exports of sugar and sugar
products that may enjoy an export refund within 1,273,500 tons and
the refund total within 499.1 million euros (429.2 million U.S.
dollars) in the current marketing year.
</P>
<P>
The draft regulation has yet to be adopted formally by the
commission, the EU's executive body.

<HEADLINE> S. African Olympic Soccer Coach to Defy FIFA's Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Olympic
soccer coach Shakes Mashaba said on Thursday he might defy his
three-match suspension by FIFA and take to the field in South
Africa's second Olympic match against Brazil in Brisbane,
Australia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There must be something wrong with FIFA to do this to me,"
said the outspoken coach after watching from the stands as his
beloved Amaglug-glug (South African Olympic soccer team) lost 1-2
against Japan in their Olympic opener at Bruce Stadium in Canberra
on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"Watching from the stands like this is simply a waste," Mashaba
said, "I may as well have stayed at home. I've never been so
disappointed."
</P>
<P>
Mashaba received a red card and a three-match suspension for
remonstrating from the sidelines with the referee during South
Africa's Olympic qualifier away to New Zealand in mid-May. He
served his first suspension in the return against New Zealand at
Vosloorus on May 27 and Thursday night was his second.
</P>
<P>
"On top of the suspension, I've been hit with a three thousand
dollars fine," said Mashaba, "That's 18,000 rand (about 2,600 U.S
dollars) before I'm allowed back. FIFA sent a letter to the
Olympic soccer organisers, informing them that they must instil my
suspension here."
</P>
<P>
"I tell you, I'm looking at defying this," the coach said,
adding that the South African Football Association was "very
supportive about my situation with the fine."
</P>
<P>
Mashaba also said that the Japanese had the upper hand because
they had many opportunities to watch the South Africans in
training.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Dumise Ngobe who the South African camp thought
went missing in transit to Canberra via Sydney, Mashaba said that
he had received a fax that the midfield ace was injured.
</P>
<P>
"He is back in South Africa because he is injured," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a callup has apparently gone back to South Africa
for the services of either Patrick Mbuthu of Kaizer Chiefs,
Lebohong Kukame of Bloemfontein Celtic or Mzunani Mgwigwi of Bush
Bucks to help bolster the midfield.
</P>
<P>
Mbuthu was originally rejected from the South African Olympic
soccer team back in South Africa when National Olympic Committee
of South Africa's medical staff detected a leg injury.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- If smiles are anything
to go by 26-year-old Hezekiel Sepeng is a racing certainty of gold
in this year's Olympic 800 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta silver medallist Thursday breezed into Sydney with
coach JP van de Merwe and declared himself fit.
</P>
<P>
The athlete had just arrived in the Olympic city from his
Brisbane training camp where he spent one and a half weeks honing
his talent and sharpening up his speed.
</P>
<P>
On being selected to carry South Africa's Olympic flag, Sepeng
said: "It is a privilege and honour to carry the flag. I will be
the first person to carry the flag in the new millennium. I've
never carried a flag in the Olympic Games before and only once in
the Vancouver Commonwealth Games in 1994," he said.
</P>
<P>
Coach JP van der Merwe was upbeat about Sepeng's chances of
moving one up to take gold.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the Atlanta Olympics the heats have rest days in
between. This gives the average runner a chance, but Hezekiel has
the strength and endurance to cope with one heat after another,"
the coach added.

<HEADLINE> Asian Tourism Regains Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Tourism in the East Asia/
Pacific region is back on track with a spectacular increase of 11.
1 percent in arrivals, the biggest increase in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals to the region grew to 97.2 million in 1999 and
are expected to hit 100 million this year, said Dawid de Villiers,
deputy secretary general of the World Tourism Organization (WTO),
in opening the annual International Tourism Asia (ITA) 2000 in
Hong Kong on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The resilience of the tourism sector, its ability to adapt to
changing circumstances and bounce back are reflected in the
results for 1999 and we are looking for even more improvement in
the year 2000," said Villiers.
</P>
<P>
WTO predicts arrivals to East Asia/Pacific will hit nearly 110
million in 2000 due to strong economic growth in the region. By
2010, WTO is predicting 195 million tourists will chose a
destination in East Asia/Pacific and by 2020 the total expected to
reach 397 million, representing fully one-fourth of all
international tourism.
</P>
<P>
Growth earnings have not kept pace with the rapid growth in
arrivals, because tourists are staying for shorter periods of time
and prices are still low in many parts of the East Asia/Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
However, outbound tourism by East Asia/Pacific residents is on
the rebound. Some 108 million people of the region are expected to
pack their bags and head for foreign destinations this year.

JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- September 13, long touted as the day that Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat would declare a Palestinian state, came and went
Wednesday with neither fanfare nor a declaration of independence,
only another announcement that contacts between Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators will resume in the United States.
</P>

Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, in the U.S. for

-- Israel's planned state budget for 2001 exceeds 240 billion
shekels (about 59 billion U.S. dollars), while calls for higher
spending on education and infrastructure. Compared to the year 2000
defense figure, the 2001 defense budget will rise by 750 million
shekels (about 185.6 million dollars) to 37.5 billion shekels
(about 9.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing Wednesday at the Finance Ministry,
in advance of the government's expected approval of the budget next
week, officials stressed that the government's expenditures in 2001
will exceed those of 2000 by 5 billion shekels (1.25 billion
dollars).

Barakeh, leader of Israeli Arab's Hadash party, be investigated on
suspicion of inciting demonstrators to attack police.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Arab leaders immediately denounced the decision, with
the monitoring committee of the Arab leadership calling for mass
demonstrations wherever Barakeh is called for questioning.
</P>
<P>
The committee also called for the immediate dismissal of
northern region police chief Commander Alik Ron, who revealed on

-- Seven years after the signing of the declaration of
Principles (the Oslo Accords) between Israel and the Palestinians
on the White House lawn, several hundred Peace Now activists
rallied Wednesday evening in Jerusalem and called on Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to give up
their efforts because of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The rally, held under the slogan "The conflict ends in
Jerusalem: two capitals in one city," began with a torchlight march
along the holy city's Route 1.
</P>
<P>
"Ehud, Ehud, don't be afraid: two capitals in one city," the
predominantly secular left-wing crowd chanted as it made its way
along the outer walls of the Old City toward Jaffa Gate.

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Threatens to Attack Philippine Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MANILA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Abu Sayyaf group which is
holding 19 Filipino and foreign hostages in the southern
Philippine province of Sulu threatened Thursday to attack southern
cities if the military launches an attack against them.
</P>
<P>
In a radio program, Abu Sayyaf spokesman Abu Sabaya said they
have already deployed guerrillas "who could create trouble" in the
southern cities of Zamboanga, Davao and General Santos.
</P>
<P>
The threat followed suggestions from government officials and
academicians that the government should consider a military attack
on the Abu Sayyaf rebel group.
</P>
<P>
"They should think a thousand times before pushing through
with a military operation," said Sabaya.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno said the
government is not likely to announce what option it would take in
dealing with the Abu Sayyaf, when it will take it and how the
action will be carried out.
</P>
<P>
"What the government does, when the government does it and how
it does is not something that we're going to be talking about in
media briefings or in press conferences," Puno said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the government should announce general
actions involving the hostage crisis but details should be kept
secret to protect government operations.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the government is awaiting the outcome of the talks
between chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado and the Abu
Sayyaf leaders before deciding what option it would take in
dealing with the terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf abducted three Malaysians from Pandanan,
Malaysia, last Sunday, one day after it released four Europeans,
the last foreigners from a group of 21 hostages taken in April
from the Sipadan island of Malaysian.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is also holding one Filipino captured in April,
two French television journalists, an American Muslim and 12
Filipino Christian evangelists in Sulu province.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Concerned About Japan's Distortion of History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has expressed
growing concerns over recent moves by Japan to produce school
textbooks containing distorted descriptions of Japanese modern
history, especially during its occupation of the Korean peninsula
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on Thursday, Choo Kyu-ho, director
general of the Foreign Affairs-Trade Ministry's Asian-Pacific
Affairs Bureau, said the textbooks distort descriptions of issues
such as calling wartime sex slaves for Japanese army-men "comfort
women," and other issues regarding Japan's colonial rule of the
Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In August, Choo delivered South Korea's message concerning the
distorted descriptions to the Japanese Embassy in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The compilation of Japan's textbooks has long been a diplomatic
issue between Tokyo and Seoul as well as other Asian countries,
since Japan tries to gloss over its atrocities in Asian countries
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
A group of Japanese rightist scholars have recently compiled a
new edition of middle school history textbooks reportedly
containing distorted history, which is now being examined for
approval by the Japanese Education Ministry.
</P>
<P>
When approved by the ministry, the new edition of the history
textbook will be used in middle schools in Japan beginning from
2002.
</P>
<P>
At present, all local governments in Japan can select any one
of eight versions of history textbooks authorized by the ministry.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for Reinforced EU Police Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday called for a
reinforced police cooperation among 15 European Union (EU)
countries to fight organized crimes in coordination with the
coming into force of a common European judicial space.
</P>
<P>
French Interior Minister Daniel Vaillant said at a conference
of general directors of police forces of EU countries here that
organized crimes are threatening public order, the democratic
system and economic interests of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister called on the police forces of the 15
countries to work out "concrete strategies" in preparing for a
common European judicial space, in the fight against illegal
immigration, and in reinforcing police presence in public places.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the police are the most important forces to
fight organized crimes in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Through a future common judicial space, Europe will seek to
protect public and individual freedom and at the same time better
fight aggressions from organized criminal groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU countries will also set up a common police school whose
first sessions will be opened in November 2000 by France, the
current rotating presidency state of EU, said the interior
minister.

<HEADLINE> Belgian PM Gives Protesting Truckers Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Prime Minister Guy
Verhofstadt told truck drivers Thursday to respond within this
afternoon to an official draft agreement to compensate them for
high cost of fuel.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has shown itself reasonable with the
draft accord and it is now up to the truckers to do so, as the
public is expecting such result.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reiterated later in a televised address to
the nation that the government has been reasonable and he "would
now like to see the truckers be as reasonable."
</P>
<P>
The government and transport sector reached a draft agreement
early this morning after night-long negotiations. The accord
reached between Transport Minister Isabelle Durant and
representatives of the transport sector has been presented to the
trade unions.
</P>
<P>
Verhofstadt warned the truckers, who have blockaded the
country's main roads since Sunday in a protest against high fuel
taxes, that he would not tolerate a minority of hauliers
effectively holding the nation to ransom.
</P>
<P>
So far, no details about the accord have been revealed, but
Flemish Transportation Federation (SAV) said it no longer requires
the reduction of excise taxes on diesel and instead a number of
structural measures have been proposed.
</P>
<P>
The government has refused demands for a direct cut in diesel
excise duty, offering instead of a package of social and fiscal
measures. The prime minister said he hopes to hear the unions'
response to that offer this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Welcomes Lifting of EU Sanctions on Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Moscow Thursday welcomed the
European Union's decision to lift political and diplomatic
sanctions on Austria.
</P>
<P>
"Russia regards the decision as a positive step," a spokesman
for the Russian Foreign Ministry said to reporters.
</P>
<P>
Russia invariably keeps to the principle of good neighborliness
and mutually beneficial cooperation in its relations with Austria,
and "the relations were maintained in a regular regime throughout
recent months," he noted. "We are considering further steps in
developing a political dialogue with Austria, including summit
contacts."
</P>
<P>
"In assessing the activities of the Austrian government and any
other fully-fledged member of the international community, Russia
intends to continue being guided by their concrete policy,
primarily in spheres that bear a relation to the interests of
Russia and European security and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, European Union (EU) countries unconditionally
lifted controversial diplomatic sanctions imposed Austria earlier
this year for bringing the far-right Freedom Party into a
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The party had waged an anti-foreigner and anti-EU expansion
campaign in last year's elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the sanctions, EU countries broke off bilateral political
contacts with Austria to express their dismay at the inclusion of
Haider's Freedom Party in the government formed in February.
</P>
<P>
The decision to withdraw the unprecedented measures was hailed
by Austria, but the 14 other EU states said they still had deep
reservations about Haider's party and vowed to monitor the group
carefully.
</P>
<P>
France was at the forefront of those backing the sanctions, but
the measures were less well received in some smaller states, which
saw them as an attempt by the larger EU countries to interfere in
the internal affairs of their weaker neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The move also infuriated many Austrians and led to fears that
Vienna might stall important EU negotiations unless its diplomatic
isolation was lifted.

<HEADLINE> Execution of Cheng Kejie -- Victory of Justice and Law: People's Daily (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, the leading
newspaper in China, will publish a commentary Friday to hail the
execution of a former high-ranking official "a victory of justice
and rule of law".
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Severely Punish Corrupt Officials and Ring the
Alarming Bell Ceaselessly", the commentary marks Thursday's
execution of Cheng Kejie, a former vice chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Cheng, who was also former deputy secretary of the regional
Party committee and former chairman of the government of the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in south China , "used his powers
to accept huge amounts of bribes and was severely punished
according to law," the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Cheng has only himself to blame and deserves the punishment,
the commentary adds. It calls Cheng a "typical corrupt element",
as his criminal activities has damaged the reputation of the Party
and the government.
</P>
<P>
The execution of Cheng indicates that the Party and the
government have further heightened penalties for punishing
corruption in accordance with the law, which is sure to further
consolidate the confidence of Party members, officials and local
residents to combat corruption, it says.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cheng is the highest-ranking Chinese official executed for
bribery since the founding of the People's Republic of China in
1949.
</P>
<P>
The severe punishment against Cheng has displayed the
determination of the CPC Central Committee to strictly control the
Party and severely punish corruption, the commentary stresses.
Opposing corruption is a serious political struggle which is
decisive to the fate of the Party and the nation, it says.
</P>
<P>
Cheng's case shows that the CPC is completely capable of
eliminating cancers invading into the body of the Party, by its
own powers, to maintain its progressive nature and purity, the
commentary points out.
</P>
<P>
The judicial judgment on Cheng's case symbolizes the
requirements for governing the nation with law and the principle
of equality of all people before the law, it says.
</P>
<P>
Cheng's case serves as another warning to Party members and
officials, the commentary says, asking them to think about this
when holding leading positions.
</P>
<P>
Phrasing it as a long-term and difficult task for the Party to
fight against corruption, the commentary urges to further
strengthen the crack-downs so as to firmly curb the spreading of
corruption, on the one hand, and clean up soils for the birth and
spreading of corruption by deepening reforms, on the other.
</P>
<P>
It proposes that the Party's internal supervision and public
supervision be improved and judicial departments at different
levels make full use of legal means to harshly punish corrupt
officials.

<HEADLINE> Manila Tries to Minimize Impact of Oil Price Increase: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
cautioned militant groups Thursday against setting up barricades
similar to what protest groups have done in Europe to dramatize
their disapproval over rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said barricading oil depots
will do more harm than good, because it increases demand for
petroleum products and defeats the purpose of seeking lower oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
"Prices will even increase further if you barricade oil depots.
If you choke off supply, the demand will increase. You are just
creating a black market for oil products," Zamora said in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
He reacted to reports indicating that militant groups are
planning to protest rising oil prices by barricading the depots of
major oil companies in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the government will not allow these barricades to
be set up, especially if they pose a threat to peace and order.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that rising oil prices in the Philippines should
not be lamed on the government nor on oil firms operating here,
but on the high prices of crude oil in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The government has assured the public that it will continue to
explore ways to minimize the impact of the series of oil price
increases on the public, such as keeping prices of basic goods
within affordable levels.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said that despite several rounds of oil price hikes,
domestic fuel prices remain the lowest among non-oil producing
countries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations Millennium Summit held recently in New
York, Philippine President Joseph Estrada called on oil-producing
nations to rationalize oil prices to help developing economies
reeling from rising fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also directed government agencies to take the lead in
mitigating the impact of high oil prices by ordering a 10 percent
cut in the use of fuel in all state departments and offices.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Mario Tiaoqui of the Department of Energy has also
called for a concerted effort among member-states of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations against high oil prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government
Thursday lifted nearly two weeks' restriction on senior leaders of
the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) during its
investigation into a matter said to be in connection with some 15
foreigners and a team from the U.S. Congress who visited the party
's headquarters here late last month.
</P>
<P>
"Since noon today, those senior NLD members are no longer
required to stay at their respective residences and they can
resume their daily activities as usual," said an official
Information Sheet released here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the restriction on the NLD leaders came hours

State Peace and Development Council, met with NLD Chairman U Aung
Shwe earlier in the morning the same day.
</P>
<P>
The information sheet quoted Khin Nyunt as saying that the
government has had a "fruitful meeting" with the NLD, which was
also attended by Deputy Foreign Minister U Khin Maung Win.
</P>
<P>
The government called on political parties in the country to
continue working towards maintaining the existing peace, stability
and tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
On September 2, the Myanmar authorities carried out a search
operation at the NLD headquarters, charging some 15 foreigners
with holding a trumped-up discussions on education at the party's
headquarters earlier on August 21 and having it videotaped and
distributed abroad, jeopardizing the present peaceful pursuit of
education in the country.
</P>
<P>
The search took place on the same day after NLD General
Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi, along with more than a dozen others,
was brought back from Dala area in Yangon division where they had
been barred from travelling further after staying there for a
total of eight days.

LUSAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba says although the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has
certain reservations for the Lusaka peace accord, it is still in
line with the Lusaka agreement.

<P>
He said the President of the United Nations (U.N.) Security
Council made a statement at the millennium summit in New York

"The president of the United Nations Security Council made a
statement confirming the Lusaka peace process and getting the
parties involved to implement it. The people of Congo may have
certain reservations about some points in the Lusaka peace process
but they are in line with the time table and are not going outside
the Lusaka peace protocol," he said when asked whether the
Congolese transitional parliament would endorse the Lusaka peace
agreement signed last year.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba explained that the Lusaka peace process was neither a
Lusaka document nor a Southern African Development Community (SADC)
document but a United Nations one and "we are in it and are going

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The 15-nation European Union
(EU) recorded a deficit of 15 billion euros (12.9 billion U.S.

22.8 billion euros (19.6 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The surge in EU's account deficit in the first quarter of the

While in the second quarter of 2000, the EU's external balance

<HEADLINE> Chan Pays Tribute to Hong Kong's Olympians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Administrative
Secretary Anson Chan Thursday paid tribute to the members of Hong
Kong's 'historic' Olympic squad.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception to welcome the Hong Kong team to Sydney,
Chan said, "We are all very proud of our team. It is the strongest
we have ever sent to an Olympics. It includes six Asian Games
medallists."
</P>
<P>
"It is also one of our largest Olympic contingents - 31
athletes competing in nine sports, backed up by a strong and
dedicated group of coaching staff and Olympic Committee officials,
" Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"You should also feel proud that you are making history," she
told the Hong Kong athletes. "As you know, these Games are
especially significant because we are participating in our first
Olympics as 'Hong Kong, China'," she said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a prime example of how 'One Country, Two Systems' is
working for us in Hong Kong," Chan said. "But I suppose, on this
occasion, you could say this is more a case of 'One Country, Two
Teams'," she added.
</P>
<P>
Chan said Hong Kong athletes, through hard work, determination
and self-sacrifice, had reached the pinnacle of sporting
excellence. She said everyone in Hong Kong would follow their
progress with enormous interest.
</P>
<P>
"Our participation in these Games, and the enormous goodwill
they generate, makes us even more determined to host the Asian
Games in Hong Kong," she said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong first sent teams to compete internationally in 1934,
making a debut at the British Empire Games in London. Hong Kong
competed regularly in what became known as the Commonwealth Games,
and made a final appearance at the 1994 Games in Victoria, Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Sports Federation and Olympic Committee was
founded in 1949 and recognized as the national Olympic committee
in 1951. "Since then, Hong Kong has competed in every Olympics and
every Asian Games - starting with the 1952 Helsinki Olympics and
the 1954 Asian Games in Manila," said Chan.

<HEADLINE> Inland Aid Helps Development in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Legqog, chairman of the Tibetan
Autonomous Region, today refuted comments by Western media that
the Chinese government has changed the Tibetans' traditional way
of life.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with journalists from both the Chinese mainland
and Taiwan, he said everything the government has done is for the
Tibetans to live a happy life, just like people in other parts of
China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that though the living standards of Tibetans have
greatly improved, Tibetans still follow their traditions and
customs.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Tibetan festivals, such as the Tibetan New Year and
the Xodoin Festival are being celebrated as before and with
additional elements of modern lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
"The society is making progress. We Tibetans want more than
qingke Barley liquor and ciba, we also want modern things," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Raidi, deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional
Committee of the Communist Party of China, told the journalists
that aid from other ethnic groups in China has greatly promoted
the social progress in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Chinese government decided that 15 provinces and
municipalities will form a partnership with seven prefectures of
Tibet to promote the development of autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Since then, aid by these regions has greatly helped the
development of infrastructure, culture, education, health and
agriculture in Tibet, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Practices in the last few years have proved that aid has
benefited Tibetans and that there would not have been development
in Tibet without the aid. We Tibetans are grateful," he said.

This is the first major international exhibition to explore how

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China places great importance
on promoting economic and trade cooperation with Argentina, and
will work to create favorable conditions for cooperation between
business communities of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon today attended by entrepreneurs of the
two countries, Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo said that both
countries are large developing countries, and share the same
willingness to promote economic and trade cooperation. He added
that the process of China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) is in its final stages, thus providing more
opportunities for the two countries' businessmen to engage in
economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Broad prospects exist for bilateral economic and trade
cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China encourages domestic enterprises to invest and set up
factories overseas, and welcomes foreign investment as well, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between the two countries in the first seven
months this year reached 850 million U.S. dollars, up 88 percent
over a year ago, according to Chinese Customs statistics.
</P>
<P>
Argentina mainly exports wheat, soybean oil, steel and crude
oil to China, which exports mechanical and electronic products,
textile and light industrial products to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chinese color TV, washing machine and air conditioner
producers have worked jointly with their Argentine counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Fernando de la Rua said that the two
economies are complementary, and potential abounds for cooperation
in food, industrial technology and mutual investment, adding that
a bilateral agreement signed last year on China's entry into the
WTO will significantly increase trade volume.
</P>
<P>
In addition, another agreement on the promotion and protection
of mutual investment also helped economic and trade ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese business leaders, including those from financial and
trade sectors, and Argentine entrepreneurs accompanying the
president on the visit attended the luncheon.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, entrepreneurs of the two countries had one-on-one
discussions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Following is a chronology of
the case of Cheng Kejie, a former vice chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), who was
executed today on charges of bribery:
</P>
<P>
-- In August 1999, the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and judicial
departments started investigations into Cheng's case.
</P>
<P>

because of his violation of laws and disciplines.
</P>
<P>

Inspection held a news conference to publicize the progress in
investigations of Cheng's case. It said Cheng had been expelled
from the Party.
</P>
<P>
-- On April 21, the Standing Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Regional People's Congress held a meeting to dismiss
Cheng as a deputy to the Ninth NPC. The decision was reported to
the NPC Standing Committee for records.
</P>
<P>

Cheng's case.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- On September 7, the supreme court approved the death penalty
for Cheng.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Blacklists Jordanians Dealing With Israel, PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is blacklisting Jordanian
businessmen who are dealing with Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) to ban them from trading with Iraq,
sources with Jordan's chamber of industry said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi stand was announced by Iraqi Minister of Trade
Mohammad Mehdi Salah to a delegation of the chamber which visited
Baghdad earlier this week to explore the possibilities of expanding
business cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi minister told us that Iraq will blacklist any
Jordanian firm that trades with the Zionist enemy and the PNA,"
said Abul Ragheb, a member of the delegation.
</P>
<P>
Currently Iraq has the names of 85 Jordanian companies which
have commercial ties with the Jewish state and the PNA, Iraqi
officials told members of the delegation during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, Jordan's largest trade partner, remains a staunch critic
of any peace deals between Arabs and Israel in the current Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials also blamed Jordan for succumbing to the United
States pressure not to expand trade ties with Iraq in conformity
with the the decade-old international sanctions on the country
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Currently, over 60 percent of Jordan's exports are destined for
Iraqi markets, and Iraq remained the sole oil supplier for Jordan,
providing 50,000 to 75,000 barrels of crude oil a day to the
kingdom at preferential prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALRM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel conducted on Thursday
another test of its Arrow-2 anti-ballistic missile system by "
hitting" a live, incoming target of "Scud" missile fired from the
Mediterranean Sea in a simulated enemy attack, the military said.
</P>
<P>
The "Scud" target, dubbed the Black Sparrow which was developed
and produced by Rafael company of the Armament Development
Authority, was dropped from an Israel Air Force's F-15 jet fighter
from a high altitude above the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow-2 missile system fired its missile from its launch
site at Palmahim Air Base south of Tel Aviv after discovering the
incoming target and destroyed it successfully, the military added.
</P>
<P>
It was the first live test of the Black Sparrow. The last test
was conducted on November 1 last year and in that test, its
seventh, the system hit a real incoming missile fired by U.S.-made,
sea-launch rocket.
</P>
<P>
The United States military personnel witnessed Thursday's test
and said that they will report to Washington about the testing
results.
</P>
<P>
The first battalion of Arrow-2 system was deployed in central
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The second battalion is slated to be placed east of Hadera near
Israel's northern seaport city of Haifa, but that has been delayed
by strong opposition from local residents, who said that the
system's radar would be hazardous to their health.
</P>
<P>
Israel officially declared in March its newly developed Arrow-2
missile defense system operational, rendering Israel the first
country in the world to have the capacity to defend itself against
ballistic missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow-2 system will definitely help enhance Israel's defense
capability in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow -2 system, a U.S.-Israel joint venture including
missiles, launchers, radar and the control and command system, cost
1.3 billion U.S. dollars to develop. By 2010, the total investment
in the project will reach 2.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The system is designed to deal with Scud and Scud-derived
ballistic missiles in the arsenals of Syria, Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The system's early warning and fire-control system is designed
to pick up and track incoming missiles from a distance of 500
kilometers, while its control and command system can guide the
launches of the interceptors and is capable of dealing with up to
14 intercepts at a time.
</P>
<P>
However, this system can not protect against Iran's advanced
Shehab-3 or Shehab-4 ballistic missiles, Israel's high-level
officials of the defense establishment have warned. The missile is
capable of hitting Israel, Saudi Arabia and U.S. forces in the
region.
</P>
<P>
But when more advanced models of the Iranian ballistic missiles
become operational, the Arrow-2 system can be improved to provide
sufficient response, they added.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Handle Hostage Issue by Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
maintained Thursday that it has the capability to handle the
hostage situation involving the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu province,
either through negotiation or military action.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora issued this statement as
defense officials stressed that there is no need for the
government to tap foreign assistance in dealing with the hostage
standoff.
</P>
<P>
"Once we see there is a chance to move without endangering
lives of the hostages, we'll move. But now is not the time,"
Zamora said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of
National Defense said that the government is leaving the issue to
chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado has succeeded in securing the safe release of all
the European and Malaysian hostages kidnapped almost five months
ago by Abu Sayyaf bandits from a resort on Sipadan island in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Only Filipino Roland Ullah from the batch of the Sipadan
hostages now remains in the hands of the Abu Sayyaf. Aventajado is
also leading efforts to secure the release of two French
journalists and 12 prayer evangelists.
</P>
<P>
The government also has to deal with the capture of American
Jeffrey Schilling by the Abu Sayyaf, which is being handled by
Sulu Vice Governor Hadji Munib Estino, and the latest kidnapping
of three Malaysian who were taken to Sulu after being abducted
from Pandanan island off Borneo.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said there is no need for the Philippines to enlist the
help of the United States or other countries to resolve the
hostage situation in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"We have the capability as of now to deal with the situation
and we don't need foreign troops to help us. It is not true that U.
S. troops will interfere in the hostage situation. We have the
capability and we will uphold our sovereignty and independence on
this issue," Mercado said.

688 million against the 31.713 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The number of employed fell to 28.2 million in July from 29.1
million last year due to the decline in employment in the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Employment in agriculture fell 10.1 percent to 10.6 million
people in July from the 11.8 million a year earlier. The
employment in industry also decreased by 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, services employment rose by 3.0 percent to
13.1 million people in July 2000 from 12.8 million in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
Of the 28.2 million persons employed in July, about 46.7
percent worked in service sector, compared to the 37.5 percent in
agriculture sector and the 15.8 percent in industry sector.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment rate in July, however, was lower than the 13.9
percent rate registered in April when the NSO made its last
employment survey. The jobless rate in April was the highest level
in the past nine years.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt to Keep Secret Its Option in Dealing With Abu  Sayyaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MANILA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
not likely to announce what option it would take in dealing with
the Abu Sayyaf, when it will take it and how the action will be
carried out, Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the government remains firm in its position to
secure first the safe release of the remaining hostages, despite
reports quoting academicians as saying that the government may
have mishandled the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"If we had taken the military option at the beginning and
these hostages had died, I wonder what these think-tankers will
have to say," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that other foreign government leaders whose
nationals were among the 21 Sipadan hostages abducted in April by
the Abu Sayyaf, had supported the government move.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf has released all of the Sipadan hostages except
a Filipino. However, the rebel group is still holding 19 local and
foreign hostages in the southern Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
Puno aid the government is awaiting the outcome of the talks
between chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado and the Abu
Sayyaf leaders before deciding what option it would take in
dealing with the terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
However, when a decision is made, Puno said the public is not
likely to hear of the tactical moves the government will be making
in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"What the government does, when the government does it and how
it does is not something that we're going to be talking about in
media briefings or in press conferences," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he dismissed speculations that the
activation of a government anti-terrorist elite force is a move
taken in preparation for attacks against the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Puno explained that the activation of the anti-terrorist elite
force is only part of the efforts of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines and the Philippine National Police to improve their
defense capabilities.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Listed as Most Corrupt Country in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has been ranked as the
most corrupt country in the world by a global watchdog against
corrupt practices, local newspaper This Day reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to an annual survey released on Wednesday by the
Berlin-based Transparency International, of which President
Olusegun Obasanjo had been chairman, Nigeria, among 90 countries
surveyed worldwide, is number one on the list of shame.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which showed Nigeria moving from last year's 27th
to the first this year, dealt a serious blow to the on-going anti-
corruption crusade of Obasanjo's administration, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Four other African countries are also among the top 10 most
corrupt nations listed by the Transparency International, while
Finland listed as the world's cleanest country.
</P>
<P>
However, the transparency survey, which was released as
Obasanjo began his official visit to Britain for debt forgiveness,
kept silent on both the anti-corruption crusade of Obasanjo's
administration and the Anti-Corruption Act adopted.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Officials Warned on Policy Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
warned all public officials not to make statements which are not
in consonance with the government policies, local media reported
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from the vice-president's office on
Wednesday, the government order was aimed to arrest the spate of
conflicting statements by top government officials on key policies.
</P>
<P>
The government regretted that some pronouncements by senior
government officials "apart from not reflecting the position of
the administration on major policy issues, do also have the
tendencies of misleading investors and hampering the overall
development goal of this administration", said the statement read
by Information Minister Jerry Gana.
</P>
<P>
Gana also warned that all public officials are bound to reflect
and defend consistently government positions on key policy issues,
and they are "at liberty to resign" if such policies are not
acceptable to them.
</P>
<P>
Public officers were further advised to always seek
clarification from appropriate quarters before volunteering
opinions on policy matters.
</P>
<P>
Recent divergent views from senior government officials have
reportedly sent conflicting signals to the public over the issues
concerning the government's on-going privatization program.

<HEADLINE> Spain Blanks South Korea 3-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADELAIDE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Spain, one of the favourites
for the gold medal of the men's soccer tournament at the Sydney
Olympic Games, had a brilliant start on Thursday with a 3-0
victory over South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniards, world title holder of under-20 championships
last year, dominated the Group B match and gave South Koreans
little chance to breath throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
After 10 minutes, Raul Tamudo ended an audacious run down the
middle by sending a high, slightly swerving ball at the South
Korean goal. But goalkeeper Kim Yong-dae made a stunning save,
tipping the ball over the bar.
</P>
<P>
That shot led indirectly to the Spanish goal. The South Korean
defense never managed to clear the ensuing corner and captain Toni
Velamazan finally drilled a left-footed volley from more than 20
meters into the roof the South Korean net.
</P>
<P>
With a team made up mostly of collegians, South Korea chose to
pack its defense and look for counters off long balls.
</P>
<P>
One move provided South Korea's first chance when Kim Do-hoon,
one of the few professionals on the roster, charged down the left
flank. No one met his threatening cross but the unsettled Spanish
defense seemed to have lost its orientation until goalkeeper
Daniel Aranzubia caught the ball.
</P>
<P>
Spain, a highly rated team made up of emerging stars who play
for big clubs at home, in Portugal and in Italy, replied quickly
and Kang Chul came dangerously close to scoring an own goal,
sending a clearance just wide of his own net with two Spaniards
bearing down on net.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish pressure paid off in the 26th when AC Milan forward
Jose Mari evaded South Korean captain Kim Do-kyun then smartly
raced past Kang and Park Donbg-hyuk to create space for an open
shot that again left Kim Yong-dae helpless.
</P>
<P>
The overmatched South Koreans conceded another one after 37
minutes. Tamudo, collecting a pass chipped over the South Korean
defense, slipped but managed to hit the left post from a tough
angle. The ball bounced into the middle of the South Korean box
and Barcelona midfielder Xavier "Xavi" Hernandez pounced on it to
score into the open side of the net.
</P>
<P>
It took two more outstanding saves from the Korean goalkeeper
to prevent Spain from scoring quickly after the break. Kim Yong-
dae first knocked away with his left foot a point-blank effort by
Velamazan, then stretched to full length to turn away a 20-meter
drive by Gabriel "Gabri" Garcia.
</P>
<P>
South Korea came close twice late in the match. A curling free
kick over the Spanish wall had goalkeeper Daniel Aranzubia
scrambling to push it over the bar and then Kim Do-hoon failed to
connect with a cross to the far post.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Service Sector As Engine of China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Although China's exports surged 35.9 percent year-on-year in
the first seven months of 2000, the growth will moderate to 10
percent to 15 percent in 2001," said Dong Tao, senior regional
economist of Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
Going forward, the recovery momentum will depend very mush on
private consumption, which is strapped by urban unemployment and
deflation in rural areas, and new drivers are needed to push the
economy beyond the 8 percent to 9 percent level, Tao noted.
</P>
<P>
China's information technology and service sectors are the next
growth engines, and should have the power to propel the economy
above 10 percent growth, possibly by 2002 or 2003, the economist
said.
</P>
<P>
A rising number of Taiwanese electronics producers relocating
to China should improve China's export and industrial mix, Tao
said, adding that with 400,000 engineers and scientists graduating
each year, China has the advantage of a large quantity of low-cost
human capital, an important element for the IT sector.
</P>
<P>
A recent research report by economists from Credit Suisse
showed that corporate restructuring, particularly in the state-
owned enterprise sector, and deregulation amid China's accession
to the WTO will be another focus for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"Mergers and acquisition are coming, but this is a three-year
concept instead of six-month, and it is disinflationary," Tao said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the significance of China's service sector, Tao
said deregulation will break de facto monopoly in the
telecommunications, finance and distribution sectors. "This will
create a surge in demand," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The economist predicted that the service sector will contribute
50 percent of China's GDP within a decade, compared to 38 percent
today.
</P>
<P>
Tao upgraded his China's 2000 growth forecast he had made in
the early February this year, when he predicted the turn-around
would come in mid-2001 with growth projected for the whole year at
7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the potential of an emerging IT development in China,
Tao said an IT boom on the mainland will likely to be full of
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"Regulations and policy restrictions have kept most foreign
investment from this potentially huge sector so far but we believe
liberalization is inevitable as most areas are covered in the WTO
accession agreement," Tao said.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Official Reiterates Anti-Separatism Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A leader of the Tibet
Autonomous Region has said that the point of the Chinese
government's campaign against the Dalai Lama is to oppose
separatism and safeguard the unity of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Raidi, deputy secretary of the regional committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), made the remark here today in an
interview with a group of reporters from China's mainland and
Taiwan Province.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the consistent stance of the Chinese government
that the Dalai Lama must give up his pro-independence position,
stop his separatist activities and make a public announcement
agreeing that Tibet is an inalienable part of the motherland,
Tibet is an administrative part of China, and the People's
Republic of China is the sole legal regime of China.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly oppose any people, any group and any nation to
interfere in China's internal affairs by using the Dalai Clique
and the so-called Tibet issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since September 27, 1987, the Dalai Clique has openly attempted
to create chaos by advocating slogans like "Tibet independence"
and "Driving out Han people" so as to damage the normal order of
people's life, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has been part of China for centuries and the so-called
Tibet issue is a result of imperialist invasions. But the issue
has become complicated and acute as Western countries led by the
United States are attempting to interfere in China's internal
affairs and separate Tibet from China under the banner of the
Tibet issue and the Dalai issue.
</P>
<P>
In answering a question by a Taiwan reporter on the current
status of the unlawful "soul boy" of the Tenth Panchen illegally
appointed by the Dalai Lama in 1995, Raidi said what the Dalai
Lama did violates historic and religious rules and has no legal
might.
</P>
<P>
The illegal "soul boy" is an ordinary Chinese boy, enjoying
good health and education like other Chinese children, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, he is now an elementary student," he said. "
He is clever and has gained good academic progress."
</P>
<P>
The boy is living with his family, who have been provided with
a quiet living environment that enables them to avoid outside
interference, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition on Contemporary Chinese Art to Open Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- An Exhibition entitled "
Inside Out: New Chinese Art" is expected to open on September 22
at the Hong Kong Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
This is the first major international exhibition to explore how
the changes have spurred artists in China's mainland, Hong Kong,
Taiwan, and elsewhere to produce an astonishing stream of mold-
breaking works.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition debuted at the Asia Society Galleries in New
York in 1998 and has since traveled to the United States, Mexico
and Australia. Hong Kong is the last stop on the exhibition tour.
</P>
<P>
Mary Lee Turner, director of the Asia Society Hong Kong Center,
noted that the exhibition was a sweeping and unique look at how
Chinese artists have responded to the rapid modernization,
changing political, cultural and social realities since the late
1980's.
</P>
<P>
To tie in with the month-and-half exhibition, a series of
performances, lectures, panel discussions, student tours and other
programs with participating artists and specialists on
contemporary Chinese art will be organized.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 7,000 Street Rule Breaches in Seoul Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 14 (Xinhua) -- On average, 6,694 Seoul
citizens are fined averagly each day for breaking street
regulations, according to a report of the Seoul Municipality City
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The number was revealed after a check on breakers of street
rules jointly conducted by police and civic groups for 17 days
from August 22 to September 7 in the capital city of South Korea,
in preparation for sound street order expected for the Asia-Europe
meeting (ASEM) scheduled for October 20-21.
</P>
<P>
The violators totaled 113,804 during the check period, one per
1,643 Seoul citizens a day on average.
</P>
<P>
Illegal car parking and stopping were found to be the major
breach, accounting for 91 percent of the total with 103,587,
followed by jaywalking, littering, and spitting and gum throwing
while illegal street vending, driving into bus-only lanes and
other violations numbered 4,082.
</P>
<P>
If warnings against trivial violators without fine are included,
the number would be much larger, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the municipality has rewarded some 17 million won (
some 150,000 U.S. dollars) to 781 Seoul citizens for their
reporting on illegal dumping of waste, which is a move to
encourage citizens to participate in the campaign for cleaner and
more orderly streets.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Kill 7 Chechen Rebels in New Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal servicemen
killed seven rebels in two fresh clashes with Chechen militants in
Chechnya Wednesday, the Interfax news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Russian units uncovered a rebel ambush on the northern
outskirts of the town of Urus-Martan and five rebels were killed
in the fighting, the Russian federal forces' press center in the
North Caucasus said.
</P>
<P>
The second clash took place in Achkhoi-Martan district in west
Chechnya. A number of rebels placing landmines on the Rostov-Baku
highway were trapped by Russian troops and two of the bandits were
killed in an exchange of fire, said the press center, not
mentioning federal losses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal planes have carried out a series of air
strikes against rebel positions in Chechnya's Vedeno and Nozhai-
Yurt districts over the past 24 hours.  Su-25 attack planes
have flown seven missions, Mi-8 and Mi-24 combat helicopters over
30, An-30 reconnaissance planes have made two flights. During
these missions, three rebel strongholds and one base have
reportedly been eliminated, said the press center.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, small groups of rebels made up of three to five
men have been spotted in Sharoi district from other areas of
Chechnya, it said.
</P>
<P>
They are continuing to wage active mine warfare against the
federal forces. Over the past 24 hours, federal positions and
administrative buildings have come under rebels' fire 14 times and
Russian servicemen have defused 19 explosive devices in different
parts of the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
A homemade bomb explosion on the railway bridge across the
Chyornaya River in Chechnya's Naursky district was prevented and
five mines were also defused in other areas.
</P>
<P>
The separatists are moving around Chechnya, regrouping their
forces near some key villages and continuing to intimidate local
administration chiefs, residents loyal to the federal force, while
the federal side is shelling and bombing their formations, said
the press center.
</P>
<P>
Federal forces have tightened control over the operations of
the rebels, as the rebels are closely following the movements of
federal troops in an attempt to reveal routes linking Georgia and
Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Thailand Hopeful to Win More Medals in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- With only a day left before
the opening of 27th Olympic Games in Sydney, 59 Thai athletes are
all ready to compete in the coming 15-day event. Naturally, one
question appears in the minds of all Thai people back in home: can
their athletes earn more medals this time?
</P>
<P>
According to analysts here, the answer is quite positive.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney team is the largest-ever and the strongest in the
history of Thailand's participation to the quadrennial event.
</P>
<P>
The conservative forcast from the country's olympic committee
is at least three medals, including one silver and one bronze.
</P>
<P>
Chetta Thanajaro, who chairs the committee, said that the
tireless training and the recent successes of the Thai athletes
will give the country a better score than what it got in the
Atlanta Olympiad four years ago: a gold and a bronze.
</P>
<P>
No surprising, Thailand's hope of more medals lies mainly in
its outstanding boxing squad, including Atlanta gold medallist 57-
kg boxer Somluck Khamsing.
</P>
<P>
The Amateur Boxing Association of Thailand is also upbeat about
of the possibility about one more gold medals of Thai boxers in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Thai boxing team's Cuban coach Juan Fontanills even said his 9
boxers can possibly achieve three golds, and five of them are
medal-hopeful.
</P>
<P>
Actually, besides Somluck, Suban Punnon and Wijian Ponlid are
also among top-level boxers in the world, they all can win medals
if they can make their best this time, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the much-spotlit boxers, Thai women weightlifters are
not the media focus, but their chances of catching medals are not
slimmer.
</P>
<P>
The four-girl team including the former world 57kg women clean
and jerk champion Khessaraporn Suta, and the would-be "dark horse"
Saipin Dechsaeng in the 69kg category. Their hope for gold medals
have been widened after some strong opponents from other countries
quit this contest recently.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand's ace shooter Tavarit Majchacheep, who won
a gold medal at this year's Asian Shooting Championship with a
record 600 points in the air rifle, is also gunning for an Olympic
medal.
</P>
<P>
Although there is few hope for any medals in other events of
the total 13 sport items Thailand participates this year, they are
expected to yield better results than last time -- enter the
finals.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is competing in the Olympic Games for the 11th time.
With a no-medal debut in the 1952 Helsinki Olympic Games, the
country finally set a record by getting its first and only Olympic
gold medal in Atlanta in 1996. This time, greater rewards are
beckoning.

<HEADLINE> Maradona Escapes Serious Injury in Car Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Argentine soccer star
Diego Maradona, who has been undergoing treatment for drug
addiction in Cuba, was involved in a car crash outside Havana late
on Wednesday but suffered only slight bruises, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
39-year-old Maradona was driving a four-wheel-drive jeep
accompanied by an Argentine friend when the vehicle collided head-
on with a tourist bus on the outskirts of the Cuban capital.

examination. Maradona had bruises to his left ankle and knee,
while Fierro suffered a sprained shoulder.
</P>
<P>
They were later released and returned to the Havana health

<HEADLINE> China Aims at Breakthrough in Women's 400m Relay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China eyes at a breakthrough
in the women's 400 meters relay by entering the event's final for
its first time at the upcoming Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"Our girls are trying to earn a place in the women's 400m relay
final and if they do they will make the history to become the
first China's finalists at any Olympic sprint events," China's
coach Zhang Rongwei told Xinhua on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's team has participated in every Olympic
Games since 1984 but never got a berth in the final of the relay.
"Now we are ready to qualify for the final as long as we could
perform our best level," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The four Chinese ran their fastest time of 42.63 seconds last
month in Beijing, the result is well enough to enter the top eight
at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"There is a standard for entering the final according to the
rankings of world championships and Olympic Games in recent years,
the team which can run within 43 seconds should have no problem to
take a seat in the final," Zhang said. "If our girls run as
fast as last month they may vie for a better place than eighth,"
Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang rated China, Russia, Nigeria as the second group in the
women's 400m relay behind the United States, Bahamas, Jamaica,
Germany and France, saying the first group teams can run within 42.
50 seconds which the Chinese runners are unable to do.
</P>
<P>
"However, We have potential to overbeat others. My team has
worked for more than two months and has a very good handoff skills,
" Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team will be anchored by Li Xuemei, the first Asian
woman to break the barrier of 11 seconds in the 100 meters race.
Other runners are Liu Xiaomei, Ceng Xiujun and Qing Wangping, who
can run the times between 11.20 - 11.30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Li and Liu with two other teammates placed eight in the 1997
world championships, which is the best result ever in any world
major tournaments.

MELBOURNE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Star captain Ivan Zamorano
completed his hat trick performace in the first 55 minutes to pace
Chile for a 4-1 victory over Morocco in Group B of men's Olympic

SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- New York Knicks guard Allan

miss the U.S. team's opening game against China at the men's

"It's day to day right now and it will probably take three or

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China opened the hunt for
their first Olympic gold with a convincing 3-1 win over Nigeria
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China, runners-up in the Atlanta Olympics four years ago, took
the lead in the 12th minute when talented midfielder Zhao Lihong
cut in from the left of the box and lobbed the ball past
struggling Nigeria's goalkeeper Anna Chiejine.
</P>
<P>
But it was Sun Wen, the MVP of the 1999 World Cup, who stole
the limelight as she scored twice to hand Nigeria the heavy loss.
</P>
<P>
The captain of Chinese side shrugged off Nigeria's defenders in
the 57th minute and chipped the ball in after latching on to a
perfect pass from veteran midfielder Liu Ailing.
</P>
<P>
Seven minutes from the end, Sun, whose left thigh was heavily
strapped, stroke again with a nearly impeccable freekick.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria hit in a consolation goal from the spot in the 85th
minute.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the win was only a good start for China and they will
unite as one to win the following match against arch-rival the
United States in September 17.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased with my performance," she said, "the thigh
injury did not affect my game. And I hope we can manage a win
against the American team through concerted team efforts."
</P>
<P>
Ma Yuanan, head coach of China, said he was very happy with the
first win. "This is the first match for us in the Olympics, and I
am pleased that we have won it. My players withstood great
pressure and did a very good job. I hope they can do better and
better in the following matches."
</P>
<P>
He said China stood a great chance to beat the American team in
the next match. "China and the United States belong to the same
level. Those who make better preparation, perform better and have
good luck will win the match. We beat them once and drew once in
the past two meetings with them this year. I hope we can beat them
this time."
</P>
<P>
The talkative head coach of Nigeria Ismaila Mabo said his
players did not disappoint him. The only difference between China
and Nigeria is experience.
</P>
<P>
"My players are still very young, we will have quick
development. We believe we'll make it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Mabo held Nigeria had the chance to scrape
into the final four. "We still seem hopeful for the semifinals,
and I hope we will make it."

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Seeks Closer Cooperation With HK, Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen expects to build
closer cooperative ties with Hong Kong and Macao in a wider range
of fields in the new century, said Mayor Yu Youjun.
</P>
<P>
He described the closer cooperation between Shenzhen and Hong
Kong as "necessary and inevitable," saying it would effect common
prosperity for both Shenzhen and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Yu's remark was echoed by an economist with the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council, who said economic and trade cooperation
between Hong Kong and Shenzhen in the past two decades had proved
to be a win-win deal for both places.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, which faces Shenzhen of south China's Guangdong
province across a river, has been Shenzhen's leading source of
investment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Shenzhen has approved 21,303 Hong Kong-
financed projects since it became a special economic zone on
August 26, 1980. A total of 13.714 billion U.S. dollars of
capital from Hong Kong had poured into Shenzhen through these
projects.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong-financed businesses in Shenzhen have reported good
performances. In 1999, Hong Kong-backed businesses showed 176.22
billion yuan in sales revenue and realized 8.45 billion yuan in
profits, accounting for 69.44 percent and 68.72 percent of the
city's total, respectively. These businesses paid 4.7 billion yuan
in taxes to the state.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that along with the rapid developments in the world's
science and technology endeavors, as well as economic
globalization, both Hong Kong and Shenzhen have worked together to
speed up construction of major infrastructure projects that affect
both places, and to develop finance, commerce and trade, tourism,
information and high-tech industries.

varying degrees. Moreover, the patients suffered fewer and less
severe withdrawal symptoms than those undergoing conventional
treatment.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete statistics, China has 680,000 drug
users, 79 percent of whom are under age 35. By 1999, 224,000 drug
users underwent compulsory drug treatment in 746 rehab centers.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Side Concerns Over Annan's Statement on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Cypriots were
worried by a statement made by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Tuesday in which he referred to the "political equality" of the
Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the U.N.-sponsored indirect talks
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In an introductory statement he made on the first day of the
fourth round of the so-called proximity talks, Annan said the equal
status of the parties must be recognized explicitly in the
comprehensive settlement to be reached on the Cyprus issue, noting
that each side represents itself and not anyone else.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, which he read out to Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash during the
separate meetings he had with them, Annan noted that the
comprehensive settlement must enshrine a new partnership for
building a better future of peace, security and prosperity on a
united island.
</P>
<P>
Fears were heightened by the refusal of United Nations special
envoy to Cyprus, Alvaro de Soto, to explain the precise meaning
of "political equality." This was taken by some of Greek Cypriot
side as a step towards recognition of the Turkish Cypriot regime in
northern Cyprus.

<P>
According to Thursday's reports from New York by local media,
Clerides Wednesday called a meeting of the National Council (the
top advisory body to the president on Cyprus issue) and his
advisers in New York to discuss the developments following the
statement by Annan.
</P>
<P>
Clerides didn't attend a scheduled meeting with de Soto on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Clerides sent a letter to Annan through Cyprus'
permanent representative to the U.N. Sotos Zackheos, outlining
his "comments and positions" in regard to Annan's statement. The
details of the letter have so far not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
It is uncertain whether the Greek Cypriot side would return to
the negotiating table on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, a Mediterranean island country, has been divided into
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after an
abortive coup in Nicosia seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a republic in
northern Cyprus in 1983, which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks have been held
since last December, in an effort to find a way for a Cyprus
settlement, but so far no tangible results have been achieved. The
fourth round of the talks is underway in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side wants to establish a bizonal bicommunal
federation on the island, while the Turkish Cypriot side insists on
a confederation of two "equal states."
</P>
<P>
Reports said Greece and Cyprus are in close contact and
coordinating their efforts on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Political circles in Cyprus also expressed their concerns over
Annan's statement.

<HEADLINE> Joint Medical Team to Check Former President Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- After failing to appear
before the court for the second time on Thursday, Indonesian
former president was set to undergo further comprehensive medical
examination.
</P>
<P>
Chief judge of the Soeharto's trial Lalu Mariyun Thursday
instructed prosecuting attorney Muchtar Arifin to soon set up what
he said as the Joint Medical Team to asses the health condition of
the former ruler.
</P>
<P>
"The team consists of doctors and medical experts from the
Health Ministry,the Indonesian Doctor Association (IDI), Jakarta-
based Indonesian University, Yogyakarta-based Gadjah Mada
University and Surabaya-based Airlangga University," Mariyun said
when reading out the decision of the panel judge in the second
Soeharto's hearing.
</P>
<P>
The 79 year old man failed to appear before the trial, due to
bad health condition. On August 31, for the same reasons he also
failed to attend the first hearing.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's hearing which lasted for more than three hours with
ten minutes of suspension, seems to be packed by medical
explanations from medical team on Soeharto's condition.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto is still sick with an impending stroke attack threat.
He is also suffering language disorders (afasia), following series
of stroke attacks in recent years," Chief of the Soeharto's
medical team Teguh A.S. Ranakusuma told the trial.
</P>
<P>
"He needs some help to express his own opinion. To say some
thing, he has difficulties in picking words. But his conversation
quality cannot be guaranteed," the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, coordinator of the attorney's office-appointed
medical team overseeing the former ruler, Dr. Supardi said
Soeharto may be able to face questioning "but he has to be closely
assisted by doctors to prevent him from possible fatal stroke
attack."
</P>
<P>
Mariyun further added that the establishment of the joint
medical team was aimed at getting detail and comprehensive data
about the health condition of Soeharto. "The team will make sure
whether Soeharto is okay to appear before the court. The result of
the examination will be very important for the judges to make
further decision," Mariyun said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the judge's decision, Chief of the Soeharto's
lawyer team, Juan Felix Tampubolon said "We regreted such a
decision. Whoever will examine Soeharto, the result will be the
same (he is sick). But we have to respect the decision," he told
reporters after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
The hearing is set to be resumed again on September 28.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Post Service Ready for Internet Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Pos Malaysia, the
national postal service provider, is discussing with several local
and international companies to deliver goods purchased through the
Internet, a senior company official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The company has been prepared to deal with the Internet era and
is making plans to go into this segment, its senior general
manager (Business Operations) Abdul Malek Ahmad Shazili said.
</P>
<P>
"We have set up the infrastructure, spending about 3 million
ringgit (0.78 million U.S. dollars) and we can confidently say
that we are ready for the convergence of this technology," he told
reporters after a commemorative stamps launching.
</P>
<P>
The convergence of technology, especially in the areas of post
and the Internet, has already begun in Europe and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
He said that since Pos Malaysia was involved in the traditional
postal service, the Internet had forced it to update and extend
its services to the new medium.
</P>
<P>
"We know that only companies which give the best service will
survive this new age and that is why we are going into this early,
" he said, adding the increased usage in e-commerce would
definitely require Pos Malaysia to keep up with the changes by
providing services which are Internet based.
</P>
<P>
He said although the technology was in its early stages, Pos
Malaysia had made all the necessary arrangements to tackle it by
upgrading its existing facilities.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Welcomes Palestine's Decision on Independence Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia welcomed the
decision by the Palestinian Central Council to defer Palestine's
independence proclamation fixed for September 13.
</P>
<P>
"This decision is a reflection of the council's commitment to
the ongoing negotiations," Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid
Albar said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia fully supports the council's decision as an
accommodative and constructive move for continued substantive
consultations towards a comprehensive and sustainable peace
agreement on the question of Palestinian statehood, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia calls upon the Israeli authorities to positively
continue negotiations with the Palestinian Central Council to
successfully ensure a sustainable and equitable peace in the
region," Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
Palestine president Yasser Arafat said last month that an
independent Palestine would be declared on September 13 even if a
peace agreement was not reached with Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, he changed his mind early this month to give a chance
to the peace talks to be held at Camp David under the patronage of
U.S. President Bill Clinton soon.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Stepping Up Security on Sabah Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Soldiers will be
stationed on islands in Sabah waters in addition to existing
placements on strategically located islands, Defense Minister
Najib Tun Razak said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move came in the light of the Cabinet's decision Wednesday
to view the two abduction incidents on islands in Sabah waters as
an intrusion into Malaysia's sovereign territory, he told
reporters after opening an Armed Forces Staff College course here.
</P>
<P>
Najib said he had discussed the measure with Deputy Prime
Minister and Home Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi who has agreed to
it.
</P>
<P>
He said Armed Forces chief Gen. Zahidi Zainuddin will meet
Inspector General of Police Norian Mai to discuss the security
cooperation mechanism between the two forces.
</P>
<P>
"This is to raise the security level in Sabah waters," Najib
said.
</P>
<P>
Three Malaysians were abducted from a dive resort on Pandanan
island off Semporna, Sabah, East Malaysia, on Sunday by an armed
group and taken to Jolo island in southern Philippines, the second
such incident in Sabah waters.
</P>
<P>
On April 23, 21 people (nine Malaysians and 12 foreigners) were
kidnapped from Sipadan island off Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The Pandanan island incident showed the importance of having
joint patrols between the Malaysian and Philippine navies, Najib
said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged hotel operators on Sabah islands to cooperate
with security forces in maintaining a "total defense" concept.

SEOUL, September 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) have vowed to implement the

children by husband is not merely a family dispute, but a
violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
It urged that all departments accept letters of complaint. The
people's court should handle cases in this regard promptly and
give due consideration to the aggrieved women in terms of property
distribution, the welfare and raising of the children and housing.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing Municipal Women's Federation received more than
10,000 letters of complaint, one-fifth of which involved family
violence, said Chen Mingying, a federation official. The majority
of women feel quite helpless when it comes to be mistreated by
their husbands and their lack of legal knowledge to protect
themselves, she added.
</P>
<P>
Experts say wife's dependence on husband is the major obstacle
that makes it hard to stop family violence.

<HEADLINE> Property Market Gains on China's Largest Tourist Island (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Buyers and developers are
hanging on property market prices on the tropical island of Hainan,
China's largest Special Economic Zone (SEZ), expecting a gain
spurred by the designation of several promising new industries to
be set up on the island that may strengthen a weakening economy
there.
</P>
<P>
Buildings, not fully completed and wrapped in gauze, still dot
the downtown Haikou area, capital of the southernmost China's
island province. They are the visual reminder of the poor status
of Hainan's real estate market, which has suffered the most
serious glut in the country during 1994-1996.
</P>
<P>
However, signs are suggesting that the market may recover, as
the promotion of leisure tourism, high-yield tropical agriculture
and marine industries have started bringing in investors and
visitors.
</P>
<P>
The whole island is a tourist resort with spectacular
landscapes, beaches, endless orchards, rain forests and dead
volcanoes. Tourism has become a major contributor to the province'
s GDP growth, contributing 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, fashionable tourists tired of busy sightseeing
have turned to the enjoyment of leisure tours on the island.
Witnessing the trend, some smart realty developers renovated a
number of villas facing the Dadonghai Bay, the most picturesque
site in Sanya, southernmost of the island, into a four-star hotel
last year. The revenue shot up in the first six months of
operation with the price of a standard room running as high as 788
yuan (94.9 US dollars) per night.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, a considerable part of Hainan's 2.7 million square
meters of tourist housing was transferred from stagnant estates,
according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
The other two industries are equally effective in boosting the
real estate market. With one-third of the country's fertile
tropical land and 44 percent of the sea territory, Hainan has
become China's largest winter vegetable and fruit grower and it is
being built into a processing center for offshore natural gas and
marine resources on the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Owners of most of the 210 Taiwan-funded businesses in Hainan
mainly engage in growing fruit, fishing and aquatic processing,
own their own homes, offices and rent workshops. Shi Yong, a
former chairman of Taiwan Enterprises Association in Hainan, set
up a realty firm, despite friends' warning of Hainan's property
market risks.
</P>
<P>
He said that so long as Hainan keeps its blue skies and clean
sea water the prospect of new industries will soon be recognized
by investors.
</P>
<P>
The climbing real estate price has proved his words right. The
apartment price in the downtown area of Haikou has climbed to 1,
400 yuan (168 US dollars) per square meter, compared with below 1,
000 yuan (120 US dollars) a few years ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
The solid economic growth along with the resolute property
market reform such as property right clarification and loan
repayment have helped sell more than 1.6 million square meter
stockpiles since August of last year, which has accounted for over
20 percent of the total oversupply.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, the country's highest governing body,
decided in July this year to designate Hainan as the national
demonstration to experiment with handling the oversupply of real
estate. A special fund will be earmarked by the central government
to embark on the plan and preferential policies will be
implemented on a trial basis in Hainan to encourage housing sales.
</P>
<P>
When the Hainan SEZ was established in 1988, the other four
SEZs had taken on a promising trend after nearly a decade of
construction. Hainan has tried to adopt more open and flexible
policies to lure investors. The 34,000-square-kilometer island,
covered by forests and agricultural fields, were soon turned into
the country's largest construction site. Investors flocked in to
build more houses than it could sell in this decade.
</P>
<P>
With only 0.6 percent of the country's population, the smallest
province in China, in term of land coverage, has 10 percent of the
country's total housing stockpile, 70 million square meters.
</P>
<P>
The fall of the property market has plunged the SEZ experiment
into the doldrums in 1995, when it recorded the lowest GDP growth
among provinces in country, compared with the highest in 1992. The
economic fluctuation has scared away many investors.
</P>
<P>
However, the mammoth investment during the construction craze
has helped shape up a sound infrastructure and communications
condition on the island. High-rise buildings have taken the place
of shrimp ponds and expressways run through woods and orchards.
</P>
<P>
Urban residents in Hainan live in spacious houses with a per-
capita floor occupancy of 14.8 square meters, the highest among
cities in China.
</P>
<P>
An investigation from Hyogo-ken County, Japan, who are looking
for an estate for retired people to live in has just concluded an
investigation of Hainan's real estate market. They said that they
plan to take Hainan into consideration, because the environment is
ideal for human settlement and the low price is appealing to
elderly people on a fixed income.
</P>
<P>
Although it is still too early to predict the success of the
SEZ's property market reform, it is a good sign that the recent
recovery has been solidly supported by new pillar industries, said
Mao Zhijun, vice-chairman of Hainan Provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said it is a hard lesson for Hainan to learn that the real
estate market can not be solely dependent on the expectations of
preferential policies but the development of its own economy.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Will Oil Price Hike Significantly Affect China's Economy? (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The international oil price has risen steeply over the past
month, at one point climbing to 35 U.S. dollars per barrel -- a
record high since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
China's domestic price followed step and even hit 32 U.S.
dollars, causing people to ask if the oil price hike would
significantly affect the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
According to local industrial analysts, the sharp oil price
rise has become a potential threat for the stable growth of China'
s economy, but the negative impact won't be too noticeable at
present, because oil imports account for only about 20 percent of
the country's total output.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum industry may be the major beneficiary of the
price hike. In the first seven months, the China National
Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) earned a profit of 29.14 billion yuan,
4.4 times that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that China produced 160 million tons
of crude oil in 1999 and imported 40 million tons. Experts predict
that the oil import in 2000 will be more.
</P>
<P>
However, oil processing and consumption industries are not
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Ruohong, deputy chief-engineer of the Economic Development
Research Institute under Sinopec, said that the rise in oil prices
has placed a great burden on the ailing petrochemical industry. "
We hope the price will stand at a reasonable level," he said.
</P>
<P>
The expert also noted that the sector is striving to lower the
production cost through reducing raw material consumption and
management expenditure.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Will Oil Price Hike Significantly Affect China's Economy? (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, the domestic price of oil products has gone up after
the crude oil price hike, which also has alleviated the pressure
on the petrochemical industry to some extent, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
China's civil aviation sector, another big oil consumer, also
faces a challenge. In the first half of this year, the industry
added 1.27 billion yuan to its cost because of a hefty aero-oil
price hike.
</P>
<P>
"But there is no plan to raise air ticket prices. On the
contrary, we will endeavor to digest the increasing expenditure by
improving our efficiency," said Hai Liancheng, director of finance
with the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China.
</P>
<P>
Generally, the oil price hike is unfavorable for China's
economic development, noted Gong Jinshuang, senior engineer of the
Economic and Information Research Center under CNPC.
</P>
<P>
On one hand, he said, the hike will increase many sectors'
production costs and restrain further investment. On the other
hand, it may also cause retail prices to climb, and inflation.
</P>
<P>
"The negative impact (on China), however, is not as serious as
that for developed countries," added Gong, explaining that oil
consumption only accounts for one-fifth of China's total energy
use, and primary industrial products, like petroleum, contribute
more to the national economy than they do in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Bao Yunqiao, secretary-general of the China Energy Research
Society, believes that China's economy is able to resist the price
crisis and maintain a stable growth at present, thanks to the
government's strong macro-control capability.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, experts suggested that China should further
perfect its strategy to cope with the changeable international oil
prices, since it will rely more on imported oil in the next decade.

BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- On Thursday, the China's
securities investment fund market moved within corrections.
</P>
<P>
Restructured funds that were active yesterday went their own
ways today. Fund Tongzhi, Fund Zhujiang continued to move upwards,
becoming only gainers today, up 6.7 percent and 0.74 percent
respectively, while the other six restructured funds all declined.
</P>
<P>
As Fund Tongzhi approached the area of 1.6 yuan and 1.7 yuan,
it may find difficulties to keep upward trend in the coming
sessions. So restructured funds' activity is expected to become
weakened further.
</P>
<P>
The 22 discounted funds mainly corrected today, with the
turnover clearly contracted compared to that of yesterday. Only
trading volumes of Fund Yulong and Fund Jinghong were expanded,
while those of all the other shrank.

<HEADLINE> Protection of Cultural Relics Urged in Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Steps taken to protect
Chinese cultural relics should be upgraded when tourists begin to
rush to different relic sites during the upcoming holiday,
according to a circular issued by the State Administration of
Cultural Heritage (SACH) recently.
</P>
<P>
The circular urged all departments to keep a vigilant eye on
protecting cultural relics as well as entertaining the tourists
during the coming National Day holiday at the beginning of October.
</P>
<P>
Holiday tourism will boom during that time due to the
improvement of Chinese people's living condition and but the
extension of the holiday period will probably create new problems
in the protection of cultural relics. Due to the increase in
visitors to the different sites the fragile irreplaceable relics
may be more prone to becoming broken, damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The circular suggested that museums, memorials and showrooms
extend the time for visitors but make sure relics not be damaged.
</P>
<P>
Relics sites with a greater potential for damage to be caused
to the relics should be closed during the holiday, according to
the circular.

<HEADLINE> China Promotes Greenhouse Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Six major Chinese cities have
reported success with their pilot "greenhouse agriculture"
projects which use advanced horticultural technology and equipment
to produce crops, vegetables and flowers in greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
The projects, being carried out in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang,
Hangzhou, Guangdong and Tianjin during the past four years, have
turned out good economic, social and ecological results.
</P>
<P>
"Greenhouse agriculture" was initiated by the former State
Science and Technology Commission (Ministry of Science and
Technology) in 1996 to cope with China's shortage of per capita
natural resources and the imbalance between supply and demand of
farm and sideline products in China.
</P>
<P>
This kind of agriculture uses advanced technologies in
greenhouse operations, seed cultivation and crop planting, and the
processing of horticultural products to realize the intensive
cultivation of crops, vegetables and flowers.
</P>
<P>
Each of the six cities has a greenhouse demonstration center,
which produces pollution-free vegetables and flowers.
</P>
<P>
Those pilot projects have turned out 3.36 billion yuan (about
400 million US dollars) in output value in the past four years, or
5.6 times the amount of investment for the projects.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the use of high-tech, the per hectare yield in
the demonstration centers has increased by 40 to 50 percent, while
the use of pesticide decreased by 40 percent. The labor
productivity in agricultural production has also been greatly
improved.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Ministry of Science and Technology said that
the major tasks for the development of greenhouse agriculture in
the next five years is to continue the reform of traditional
agriculture with high technology so as to produce more salable
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will introduce better management and
personnel systems to promote the development of greenhouse
agriculture in larger areas.

<HEADLINE> Official Calls for Rule of Law in Developing W. China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Chunyun, a vice-
chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, has
urged that the rule of law be applied in the course of developing
China's economically-backward western region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the call today at
a forum on the relationship between the rule of law and the
development of the west.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was held in Chongqing Municipality, in southwest
China, and attended by leaders of standing committees of
provincial-level people's congresses from western areas.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang hailed the strategy to development the
western region as a major decision for the new century made by the
central authorities. The implementation of the strategy demands to
strengthen the legal system in the west, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The advocacy of the rule of law in developing the west meets
the requirements for the development of China's socialist market
economy and is a must for complying to the trends of economic
globalization, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's existing laws provide the basic legal
support for the strategy, but new laws and revisions of some
former ones are needed according to local conditions.
</P>
<P>
Some of the laws have to be made by the central legislature
while some are to be stipulated by local legislatures, he said.

Harun, deputy governor of Bank Negara (the central bank) Malaysia
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The institute's primary function would be to create a pool of
technical experts in performing supervisory functions in insurance
work.
</P>
<P>
It would also conduct research on the formulation of policy and
effective business strategies by member countries.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation among ASEAN's insurance regulators and industry
members should focus on confidence building measures and enhancing
international competitiveness, Salleh Harun said when officiating
the 26th ASEAN Insurance Council (AIC) meeting here.
</P>
<P>
He said while national interest would remain important, ASEAN
countries need to take a regional perspective on global
developments and work closely for the greater good of the region.
</P>
<P>
The AIC, set up in 1978, is a private sector body responsible
for overseeing cooperation among the six ASEAN insurance markets
of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The other ASEAN members -- Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam
have yet to join the AIC.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Return to Kenya's Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors, who have
kept off Kenya' Nairobi Stock Exchange for nearly a year due to
the country's poor economic environment, are coming back, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Now the economic environment in the country is more favorable
to the stock market, said John Munge from the Shah Munge brokerage
firm.
</P>
<P>
Sentiment towards the stock market in Kenya has been positive
over the last six weeks since the International Monetary Fund
resumed aid to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The country's interest rates are gradually falling, inflation
is contained despite the shortage caused by drought, while the
shilling has held its ground despite a minor fall caused by demand
for hard currency by the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Munge said these changes will result in savings for the
productive sector, including the listed companies, which will find
their way into the balance sheet and hence dividends.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the market, which had hit rock bottom
before July 31, has been bullish over the last six weeks, posting
high turnover, rising prices and index.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the turnover at the market shot up to 97 million
shillings (about 1.26 million dollars), a record over the past 16
months.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Second Largest Gold Mine to Start Production Next April  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 14 (Xinhua) --Tanzania's second
largest gold mine, the Bulyanhulu Gold Project, capable of
producing 400,000 troy ounces a year, is scheduled to start
production next April, the independent Guardian newspaper reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project is worth some 224 billion Tanzanian shillings (
about 280 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Bulyanhulu Gold Project has so far employed about 500 people
permanently. The number is expected to double by April, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The project, located south of Lake Victoria on the Victorian
Greenstone Belt in Tanzania, East Africa, is currently wholly
owned by the international Barrick Gold Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the mine began in the third quarter of 1999. It
was estimated to have 7.5 million ounces of gold reserves by the
end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's largest gold mining project, Geita Gold Mine,
jointly owned by the international companies of Ashanti Goldfields
and Anglogold, can produce 500,000 troy ounces a year.
</P>
<P>
Mining is a booming industry in Tanzania. With massive
investments by multinational companies, the mining sector recorded
a significant 27 percent growth in 1999. New mines are expected to
boost the country's gold output to one million ounces in 2001 from
around 250,000 ounces this year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Raises Sugar, Cane Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Sugar Authority (
KSA), a state institution, has announced an adjustment of the ex-
factory price of sugar and an increase in the price of cane by 16.
5 percent.
</P>
<P>
KSA Chairman Mark Too said on Wednesday that the adjustment had
been necessitated by the increase in production both at farm and
factory level, the East African Standard newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following the adjustment which took effect from Monday, the ex-
factory price of sugar now 47,500 shillings (about 617 U.S.
dollars) up from 43,705 shillings (about 567 dollars) per ton,
while cane price will move to 2,015 shillings (about 26 dollars)
up from 1,730 shillings (about 22.5 dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
Since early August, Kenya has experienced a sugar shortage
nationwide which drove up the price of sugar by 30 to 40 percent
per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Too said that while the sugar supply situation prevails, there
will be no preferred customers, forward sales nor bulk purchases
from any sugar factory by a single trader, to avoid the
opportunity for creating any artificial shortage.
</P>
<P>
To solve the current sugar shortage, the Kenyan government has
recently allowed the KSA to import 10,000 tons of sugar monthly
starting from September.

<P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Promises Every Effort to Free Hostage in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Moscow is closely watching the
developments of the kidnapping of a Russian and a Lithuanian in
Colombia and will make every effort to get them freed, the Russian
Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Russian specialist Vladimir Larin, who had been working by
contract on the construction of a hydropower plant in Colombia,
was kidnapped along with Vladimir Molodtsov, a Lithuanian citizen,
Wednesday by unidentified abductors in the northwest of Colombia,
Russian news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
Neither the motives nor the circumstances of the abduction have
been established yet, and no one has claimed responsibility for
the act or advanced any demands, but Moscow is "making every
effort" through the Russian embassy in Colombia, to free Russian
citizen and his partner, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency cited sources as saying that the two
men may have been kidnapped by a radical leftist rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Kidnappings for ransom are common in Colombia. Most of these
crimes are organized and carried out by rebel groups and the drug
cartel, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass quoted the command of the Colombian Armed Forces as
saying that some 1,800 people have been kidnapped by rebels from
different groups operating in the country since the beginning of
this year. Rebels from the National Liberation Army have abducted
more than 400 people, while members of the anti-government
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia have kidnapped about 500.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian citizens have never been kidnapped in Colombia
before, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

<HEADLINE> China Virtually Nails Women's Singles Gold, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic women's singles
contention will be a Chinese show, a top Chinese table tennis
official said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xielin, former world champion and now vice chairman of
the Chinese Table Tennis Association, said China is an odds-on
favorite for the women's singles crown.
</P>
<P>
"We have top two seeds in Wang Nan and Li Ju and No. 4 seed Sun
Jin," said Zhang. "We can hardly find an excuse if we let go the
singles title."
</P>
<P>
Wang Nan and Li Ju are also favored for the women's doubles
title.
</P>
<P>
"China face challenge from South Korea, Chinese Taipei and
Singapore in women's doubles," Zhang said. "I think Wang and Li
are the strongest duo in the field."
</P>
<P>
China swept all gold and three silver medals in Atlanta four
years ago and they may do it again in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
In every event apart from men's singles, they send the top two
seeds, the pattern only broken by the failure of the current men's
world No. 1 Wang Liqin to qualify.
</P>
<P>
Wang missed the Olympic singles boat after he failed at an
Olympic qualifying tournament to take the third spot allocated to
each nation.
</P>
<P>
In his absence from the men's singles, the favorite is Kong
Linghui, his compatriot and world champion in 1995. There could
still be an all-Chinese final with the defending Olympic champion,
Liu Guoliang, seeded third.
</P>
<P>
Kong and Liu are also tipped for the men's doubles gold.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua kept low key, saying "the
Chinese will win two gold medals in a normal case."
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully we will win three gold medals," Cai added.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Susantika Jayasinghe will
compete in three events at the Olympic Games, said Sri Lanka team
manager Sunil Gunatilleke on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe, 1997 world championship silver medalist in 200
meters, seems to be the only medal hopeful at the Games for the
country when she backs to the lineup after being dropped earlier
from the 4x100-meter relay team for skipping practice.
</P>
<P>
"Now she will run in three events of the 100 meters, 200 meters
and in the relay team," said Gunatilleke.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe, 25, skipped the Asian Games in Bangkok two years
ago, and later claimed that she was being bothered by local sports
officials including sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
From a poor family, Jayasinghe practiced running barefoot and
became only the second Sri Lankan to win a medal at a top
international meet in 49 years in 1997.

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Market Keeps Upward Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer market
maintained its upward momentum in August by seeing higher growth
in retail sales on a year-on-year basis and also over July.
</P>
<P>
According to figures the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)
released today, retail sales nationwide totaled 263.63 billion
yuan in August, up 9.3 percent in a year-on-year comparison. The
growth rate was 0.2 percentage points higher than in July and 3.3
percentage points higher than in August last year.
</P>
<P>
However, as the NBS pointed out, the gap between consumer
markets in urban and rural areas remained great. August's retail
sales in urban areas soared 10.5 percent on an annual basis to 165.
14 billion yuan, while that in rural areas grew by only 7.5
percent to 98.49 billion yuan. In terms of growth rate, the rural
market lagged behind the urban market by three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The competition in the market was also keen. According to the
NBS, the price reductions of domestic color TVs have caused some
foreign brands to cut down their prices.
</P>
<P>
Increasing sales of seasonal commodities and advertising
campaigns by retail companies also helped invigorate the consumer
market, the bureau said.

BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese treasuries stayed
quiet today. Of the six current bonds, two declined and two
advanced, with the remaining two unchanged. Transaction value
totaled 1.37 billion yuan, up 186 million from yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Participates in Developing Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the largest
economic and commercial center in east China, has taken the lead
in seeking business opportunities in China's vast western region.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five months, Huang Ju, member of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and
secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, led
investigative tours of China's western region and made development
plans with leaders in Henan, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia,
Xinjiang, Gansu and Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 cooperation projects, valued at 29.86 billion
yuan (about 3.6 billion US dollars) in infrastructure construction,
ecological protection, resources exploration, tourism, science and
education, were signed during the tours, today's People's Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
A research report on Shanghai's participation in the
development of the western region has also been completed.
According to the report, Shanghai has provided western China with
its advantages in infrastructure construction, education, science
and technology and service sectors and encourage more engineering
enterprises, talent of all kinds, financial, information and
consulting enterprises to go to the western region.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai policy-makers shared the opinion that the strategy of
developing western China is different from the frontier troops
stationed there to reclaim the wasteland 50 years ago, and the
economic development of coastal regions in 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Huang Ju stressed that new ways should be developed to expand
cooperation in social and economic development between east and
west.

<HEADLINE> Enlarged Prostate Common in Seniors: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey showed that
an enlarged prostate is the most common affliction among men with
urinary disorders in China.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the survey, conducted by the No. 1 Hospital
attached to the prestigious Beijing University, tested 95,749 men
with urinary problems from 30 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions, Beijing Morning Post reported.
</P>
<P>
After a study of the epidemiology among residents of Beijing,
Hebei, Hubei and Inner Mongolia, experts found that a man's chance
of having an enlarged prostate increases later in life.
</P>
<P>
According to a widely accepted medical standard in China, if
prostate volume is bigger than 20 ml, and maximal urine flow is
less than 15 ml per second, a man can be diagnosed as having an
enlarged prostate.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that incidence of the ailment in cities is
higher than in rural areas. Meanwhile, about 60 percent of male
urbanites older than 50 and 80 percent of octogenarians suffer
from the problem.
</P>
<P>
People in China have traditionally linked the problem with sex.
Thus, many patients were reluctant to go to see doctors, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
As the aging problem becomes more evident in China, experts are
urging for greater public awareness about prostate disease and for
more research into the treatment for enlarged prostate.

<HEADLINE> Cheng Kejie Executed Today (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the plan, the two accepted bribes and deposited
the money in overseas banks, which justified the guilty verdict
given to Cheng at the first instance, the Supreme People's Court
said.
</P>
<P>
As a senior government official, Cheng took huge amounts of
bribes, seriously violated the normal working order of government
institutions, tarnished the clean and honest image of government
personnel, discredited the fine reputation of government officials,
and thus should be harshly dealt with in accordance with the law,
the Supreme People's Court said.
</P>
<P>
Although Cheng at one time expressed his willingness to return
the bribes to the state, the actual retrieval of the ill-gotten
money was possible due to the cooperation of Li Ping, and Cheng
ultimately did not play a substantial role in giving the money
back.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court ruled that the evidence against
Cheng is true and sufficient, and that he had been judged in
accordance with law and given the proper sentence.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court approved Cheng's death sentence on
September 7 after further deliberations by the judicial committee
of the Supreme People's Court.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Cheng Kejie was executed
today by the No.1 Intermediate People's Court of Beijing, after
the confirmation and approval by China's Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Cheng, a former vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, was sentenced to death with all
political rights stripped for life on July 31 at the first
instance trial by the intermediate people's court.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Higher People's Court on August 22 rejected Cheng
Kejie's appeal, upholding the verdict at the first instance trial
by Beijing Intermediate People's Court and then submitted the case
to the Supreme People's Court for approval in accordance with
China's Criminal Procedural Law.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court confirmed that Cheng, while serving
as deputy secretary of the Chinese Communist Party's Committee of
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and chairman of the people's
government of Guangxi, had abused his power to take large bribes,
in collaboration with his mistress Li Ping.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court also found that Cheng and his
mistress had conspired to amass wealth for their planned marriage
after divorcing their spouses. The two worked out a scheme under
which Li would serve as an agent to find people willing to pay
bribes to Cheng, so that Cheng could profit illegally from them by
abusing his post as chairman of the people's government of Guangxi.

HANOI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese government decided
to grant 32 billion Vietnamese dong (VND)( roughly 2.3 million U.S.
dollars) as flood relief to four worst-hit provinces in the
country's Mekong Delta, according to Vietnam News Agency (VNA).
</P>
<P>
Of the amount of 2.3 million U.S. dollars, which was announced
by Vietnamese Permanent Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung
during his just-concluded inspection trip, the delta's Dong Thap
and Long An provinces will receive 10 billion VND (714,285 U.S.
dollars) each, meanwhile the other two provinces of the delta Kien
Giang and An Giang will be given 5 billion VND (357,142 U.S.
dollars) and 7 billion VND (500,000 U.S. dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
The flood, which started hitting the delta more than two months
ago, has caused the death of at least eight people and injuries to
hundreds of people and heavy property loss.
</P>
<P>
The flooding is also keeping nearly 150,000 pupils away from
schools.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Official Inflation Rate Incredible: Analysts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Official statistics show
Zimbabwe's inflation rate went up by 0.2 percentage point last
month, drawing sharp criticism from analysts who felt that the
figure is not credible, the weekly Business reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Office (CSO) indicated the narrow
increase in inflation rate from 53.4 percent in July to 53.6
percent in August, which was exclusive of the latest fuel price
hike averaging about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said that price adjustments resulting from the fuel price
increase would be factored in the September figure.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the CSO could be under pressure from the
government to doctor the inflation figure to boost investor
confidence, maintain a downward movement in interest rates and
solidify the country's argument on the need to resume funding from
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Analysts held there was need for the CSO to give comprehensive
explanation in its bulletins.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the inflation rate could reach 70 percent
before the end of the year due to underlying inflationary
pressures triggered by the devaluation of the Zimbabwean currency
and fuel price adjustments.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Officials Suspended for Illegal Plot Allocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambian ruling party has
suspended seven councilors for their alleged involvement in
illegal plot allocation, according to Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Acting Lusaka district chairman of the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), Rabson Ndholvu, announced the
suspensions here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ndholvu said that during the period of the suspension the
councilors will relinquish party positions they held.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka Province Minister Sonny Mulenga said the disciplinary
action was long over due because the party's name has been drawn
into disrepute.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after touring Chainda township where some residents
were found building on illegal plots, the minister said the
council should engage more council police officers in an effort to
curb illegal plot allocation and squatters in the city.
</P>
<P>
The seven councilors had already been banned earlier by Lusaka
City Council for the alleged illegal plot allocation.
</P>
<P>
Early this month Land Minister Samuel Miyanda said the
government is concerned at the rate of illegal allocation of plots
in the capital city of Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the residents who buy plots through dubious
means will continue to lose money and property.
</P>
<P>
Last month in George compound 500 illegal houses were
demolished.

<HEADLINE> Zambia More Longing for U.S. Investment: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government
welcomes the United States Trade Act which grants some African
countries market access to the U.S., but it would be more
comfortable if the Act supports investment in these countries,
Zambia Daily Mail Thursday quoted a senior trade official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Commerce, Trade and Industry permanent secretary Moses Banda
made the remarks at a monthly meeting of the Economic Association
of Zambia held this week in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
"We face shortage of goods, inflation is high and therefore we
need more capital funding," Banda said.
</P>
<P>
He observed that the trade act ignores some important sectors
in the economies of countries such as Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. trade policy allows some eligible sub-Saharan
African countries to export some identified commodities to the U.S.
duty free.

increases in oil production can bring down oil prices.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he warned that an irrational increase of
production that does not reflect a real rise in demand could
result in an oversupply, which could potentially lead to an oil
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that an energy crisis could loom in the medium
term if worldwide refining and production capacity doesn't grow.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Vietnam Sign Pacts on Debt Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Vietnam Wednesday
reached a package of agreements on the settlement of Hanoi's age-
old debts to Moscow, Russian media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the accords, Vietnam is to repay Russia a 1.7-billion-U.S.
dollar debt during a period of 23 years, on terms of the Paris
Club of creditors. The interest will have market rates, the
Interfax news agency cited Russian Finance Minister press
secretary Gennady Yezhov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Alexei
Kudrin and Vietnamese Finance Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung, who is
accompanying Vietnamese Premier Phan Van Khai in a five-day
official visit to Russia, signed these documents after the sides
held rounds of negotiations, said the press secretary.
</P>
<P>
Yezhov said that the package includes an agreement on the
settlement of the earlier released loans and a supplement to it,
and an intergovernmental protocol on the procedure of repaying the
debt to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted Russian diplomatic sources as
saying that Vietnamese debts to Moscow, including the loans of the
former Soviet Union, amount to over 11 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the sides inked a series of pacts on expanding
bilateral cooperation in the sphere of energy.
</P>
<P>
Phan Van Khai and his entourage arrived here Sunday in a bid to
boost relations with Russia. During the stay in Moscow, he was
received by Russian President Vladimir Putin, held talks with his
Russian counterpart Mikhail Kasyanov, met with speakers of the
Russian parliament and outstanding businessmen of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese delegation will leave for Belarus for a three-

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Close Higher in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed moderately
higher in Tokyo on Thursday, led mainly by high-priced information
technology (IT) issues which were boosted by Wednesday's upturn in
New York's Nasdaq composite index.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 22.76 points, or 0.14
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 16,213.28.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, added 0.54 point or 0.04 percent to 1,483.59.
</P>
<P>
After hitting the day's high of 16,311.04 in early trading, the
Nikkei lost upward momentum as corporations continued to sell
cross-held shares ahead of the midyear book-closing this month,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, investors are waiting to see how Wall Street will
move during Japan's long weekend, they said. Japan's financial
markets will be closed Friday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section grew to 573.14 million shares
from Wednesday's 559.64 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented high-tech issues were boosted by the gain in
the Nasdaq index and the yen's stabilization at a weak level
against the U.S. dollar, while several telecom issues were firm.
</P>
<P>
The rubber, glass and real estate sectors were among the
gainers, while oil distributors, steel makers, the nonferrous
metal, land transportation and brokerage sectors were among the
losers.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced
gainers 655 to 583 despite the gains in the Nikkei and TOPIX,
while 167 issues closed unchanged.

procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, who said
the former vice-minister is charged with accepting a "huge" amount
of bribes.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao, Chinese prosecutors investigated more than
23,000 corruption cases in the January-August period, and helped
to recover 1.587 billion yuan of economic losses for the state.
</P>
<P>
The number of major corruption cases which involved at least 50,
000 yuan in embezzlement or 100,000 yuan in misuse of funds was on
the rise in the eight months, he said.
</P>
<P>
They accounted for 43.7 percent of the total cases handled by
prosecutors, exceeding the figures for the same time in 1999 by 10,
000 cases, a 12.7 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Of those cases, more than 800 involved illegal use of money and
goods worth over 1 million yuan, which registered an increase of
11.7 percent over last year, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Another noticeable feature of this year's anti-corruption drive
is that the number of bribees increased sharply by 30.6 percent,
up to 6,200 in the number of cases, the senior prosecutor said.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Up Command Center for Corruption Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- To effectively crack down on
corruption cases that cross provincial borders and stave off local
protectionism, China's Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) has
set up the Command Center for Corruption Investigation.
</P>
<P>
"The Center is to strengthen the leadership of the SPP over
local prosecution offices," said Zhao Dengju, deputy procurator-
general of the SPP, here today at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Provincial level command centers will be ready for work by the
end of this year, he announced.
</P>
<P>
The SPP Center will be responsible for organizing the
investigation of cases that involve more than one province, and
cases that are not being dealt lawfully by local prosecution
offices due to local protectionism, he said.

<P>
SHENZHEN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Following are facts and
figures about the Overseas Chinese Town, a large group with 70
member companies, in Shenzhen's Special Economic Zone:
</P>
<P>
Founded in the Shahe Industrial Zone 15 years ago, the Overseas
Chinese Town is calculated for overseas Chinese to make investment
with more preferential treatment than in other areas of Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning, the group's major business was tourism. After
15 years of development, it has grown into a large conglomerate
covering home appliances, tourism and real estate industries.
</P>
<P>
The town is most famous for a galaxy of newly built scenic
sites, including Jinxiu Zhonghua (a collection of miniature
landscapes and scenery of China), Shijie Zhichuang (Window of the
World) and Huanlegu (Happy Valley).
</P>
<P>
Last year, the conglomerate raked in 16 billion yuan in sales
revenue. Over the past 15 years, the town has paid 2.8 billion
yuan in taxes to state coffers and has amassed 23.8 billion yuan
in total assets.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Negotiators Leave for U.S. for New Talks With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian negotiation team
led by chief negotiator Saeb Erekat left here early Thursday
morning for the United States to hold peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli team is headed by acting Foreign Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami, said a Palestinian source.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Culture and Information Yasser Abed-
Rabbo tole Voice of Palestine radio on Wednesday that the talks are
to start at the call of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has reiterated that it was ready to restart
the talks anywhere though U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat agreed on a venue in the Middle
East, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks have been deadlocked since July after the
collapse of the Clinton-brokered Camp David summit. The future of
Jerusalem, which both the Palestinians and Israel claim as their
capital, was the deal-breaker.
</P>
<P>
Under international pressure and appeals to proceed with the
peace process, Palestinian leadership agreed Sunday to delay
statehood declaration that had been scheduled for September 13, and
have negotiations with Israel for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian negotiating committee is meeting in
the West Bank town of Ramallah to prepare for the coming talks.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM Floats Idea of Joint NZ-Aussie Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark has floated the idea of a joint central bank with
Australia amid signs that Australia is warming to the idea of a
currency union, the Dominion reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted the prime minister as
telling the parliament Wednesday that a common currency with
Australia would not amount to New Zealand adopting the Australian
dollar.
</P>
<P>
If the two countries agree to enter a currency union, New
Zealand would seek to establish a joint central bank with
Australia, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is suggesting giving away the New Zealand currency to
Australia. Were there to be a merged currency, there would be
required to be a common central bank, as is the case with the euro,
" Helen Clark said.
</P>
<P>
Australia has shown signs of warming to the idea of monetary
union after the New Zealand prime minister told American investors
in New York last week that it might be inevitable and should be
investigated.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Governor Ian Macfariane of the Australian
Reserve Bank backs a currency union, saying: "We would be
cooperative, but would see it as predominantly a decision for New
Zealand."
</P>
<P>
However, Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said Australia is
not proposing any change to its currency or monetary arrangements
and New Zealand may be allowed to use the Australian dollar if it
wants to.
</P>
<P>
"We're not interested in any new currency, any third currency.
Now if somebody came along and said we would like to adopt your
currency and your monetary arrangements, we would look at them,"
Costello was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Govt Reveals Huge Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
has turned in a bumper surplus of 1.45 billion NZ dollars (about
600 million U.S. dollars) for the financial year from July 1999 to
June 2000, nearly twice as much as it predicted in its budget.
</P>
<P>
In a financial statement, New Zealand Finance Minister Michael
Cullen said Thursday that the government has kept control over its
spending and its financial surplus provides a "strong basis" for
going forward.
</P>
<P>
However he took much of the gloss off the announcement by
saying that over half the improvement from the budget forecast of
763 million NZ dollars (about 325 million U.S. dollars) was due to
one-off factors, such as the increase in tobacco tax and a
decrease in ACC's (accident compensation claim's) outstanding
liabilities, and that the improvement is unlikely to flow through
to current financial year.
</P>
<P>
The better-than-expected surplus has allowed the government to
repay more debt than it expected in the budget. The government's
net debt is 423 million NZ dollars (about 180 million U.S. dollars)
lower than forecast due mainly to the impact of the surplus,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
As at June 30, the net debt of the New Zealand government was
21.4 billion NZ dollars (about 9.1 billion U.S. dollars), or 20.6
percent of the country's gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Government Worried About Student Debt Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The size of New Zealand's
recorded student loan debt owed by those now living overseas has
almost doubled in a year to be worth at least 135 million NZ
dollars (about 57.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued by the New Zealand government,
Tertiary Education Minister Steve Majarey said Thursday that the
government is worried about the sudden hike, up from 71 million NZ
dollars (about 30.2 million U.S. dollars) a year ago.
</P>
<P>
He said officials are being asked to look into the issue, and
in particular to determine whether fear of mounting debt is
preventing skilled New Zealanders from coming home or contributing
to the brain drain.
</P>
<P>
The number of those who have left New Zealand permanently with
a student loan outstanding has jumped from 5,942 people at the end
of March 1999 to 10,344 at the same time this year, according to
the press release.
</P>
<P>
Majarey said the government has no real idea why the recorded
numbers have risen "so suddenly."
</P>
<P>
He said students are supposed to make arrangements to pay off
their debts while overseas, but a lack of coordination between
agencies means this has never been enforced and it appears few
students do so.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Chief Arrives to Discuss Plight of Afghan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Sadako Ogata, arrived here
Thursday on the first leg of her regional tour aimed at
highlighting the plight of Afghan refugees.
</P>
<P>
"The visit will focus on the plight of Afghan refugees and draw
international attention to the new challenges posted by one of the
world's longest and most protracted refugee predicaments," said a
UNHCR statement.
</P>
<P>
During her two-day visit in Islamabad, the High Commissioner
will hold discussions with President Rafiq Tarar, Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf and two federal ministers.
</P>
<P>
"UNHCR acknowledges the many sacrifices Pakistan has made in
hosting large refugee populations for many years," the statement
said, adding, "Pakistan has worked in partnership with UNHCR over
the years to address the needs of refugees, but has also played an
active role to find solutions to the conflicts that are so often
at the root of refugee crises."
</P>
<P>
Ogata will also visit Afghanistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Afghan refugees began fleeing in large numbers after 1979
Soviet invasion.
</P>
<P>
At the peak of the Afghan conflict a staggering 6.2 million
fled to Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, more than 4.2 million of them have returned home,
the majority with UNHCR's assistance. However, some 2.6 million
Afghans still remain in Pakistan and Iran, deterred by unrelenting
conflict and harsh economic conditions.

SHENZHEN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Following are facts and
figures about Shenzhen Special Economic Zone's (SEZ) economic
development over the past two decades:
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has had an annual economic growth rate of 31.2 percent
since it became a SEZ on August 26, 1980.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Shenzhen's gross domestic product (GDP) was 196
million yuan, but the GDP skyrocketed to 143.6 billion yuan in
1999, which put Shenzhen in the sixth place among China's large
and medium-sized cities as far as GDP goes.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, the city had an annual growth rate of
41.8 percent in industrial added value and 45.4 percent growth in
local revenues.

SHENZHEN, September 14 (Xinhua) --Following are facts and
figures about the overseas Chinese town in Shenzhen's Special
Economic Zone:
</P>
<P>
Founded in the Shahe Industrial Zone 15 years ago, the overseas
Chinese town is calculated for overseas Chinese to make investment
with more preferential treatment than in other areas of Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
It has grown into a place where large conglomerates, with more
than 70 capital, stock and shareholding companies, are doing
brisk businesses in manufacturing home appliances, tourism and
real estate development.
</P>
<P>
The town is most famous for a galaxy of newly built scenic
sites, including Jinxiu Zhonghua (a collection of miniature
landscapes and scenery of China), Shijie Zhichuang (Window of the
World) and Huanlegu (Happy Valley).
</P>
<P>
Last year, the conglomerate raked in 16 billion yuan in sales
revenue. Over the past 15 years, the town has paid 2.8 billion
yuan in taxes to state coffers and has amassed 23.8 billion yuan
in total assets.

<HEADLINE> More Imams Trained in China's Leading Muslim Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of clergy in the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China's largest Muslim area, grows
at an annual rate of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to figures recently provided by the Regional Bureau
of Religious Affairs, Ningxia has more than 5,000 imams, of whom,
70 percent are youngsters. Some 150 graduates of religious schools
have been added to the ranks each year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shouren, a 71-year-old imam, said, "I won't worry about
the lack of successors."
</P>
<P>
Islam was restricted in China in the 1960s and early 1970s
under the influence of leftism. Since the 1980s, the regional
government implemented a freedom of religion policy, redressed
mishandled cases and reopened mosques. To date, the number of
mosques in the region has increased from 1,800 in the 1980s to 3,
000, currently, said Zhang Zhongxiao, deputy director of the
regional religious bureau.

<HEADLINE> 1,155 km Coastal Dam in Bangladesh Needs Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- About 1,155 kilometers out of
the country's 5,200 kilometers coastal embankment needs immediate
repair, renovation and reconstruction to avoid any major damage,
the Bangladesh Observer reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This portion of the embankment faces the storm surge of the
Bay of Bengal regularly. The Framework Formulation Mission of the
Comprehensive Disaster Management Program (CDMP) which commenced
its work in March, 2000, found that most of the embankment in some
parts of coastal areas are not properly maintained.
</P>
<P>
A document formulated recently by the mission suggested
coordinated efforts to protect the embankment for the development
and well-being of the people by reducing loss of life, property
loss, social and economic disruption caused by natural,
environmental and human induced hazards.
</P>
<P>
The CDMP, which was jointly formulated by the assistance of
international organizations including United Nations Development
Program, Danish International Development Agency and United
Nations Children's Fund, is expected to help the Bangladeshi
government finalize the Disaster Management Act, Policy and the
National Disaster Management Plan.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Officials Rule Australian Duo's Boat Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian duo Darren Bundock
and John Forbes suffered a setback when Olympic officials declared
their boat illegal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 world champions appealed after the "trampoline"
stretching between the twin hulls of their catamaran was deemed
not to meet international standards.
</P>
<P>
"The facts presented by the sailors do not alter the previous
ruling," International Sailing Federation representative and chief
measurer Jean-Pierre Marmier said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Australian pair, ranked third in the world, were ordered
on Tuesday to change the trampoline before the start of their
event on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An Australian team spokesman said Forbes and Bundock were
considering an appeal to the regatta's 26-member international
jury, which will arbitrate on protests during the 14 days of
racing in Sydney Harbor.
</P>
<P>
The regatta's official measurers, who have worked their way
through most of the 275 boats taking part, ruled that the
Australians' trampoline was more like a web or netting than the
standard canvas-like coverings.
</P>
<P>
Race rules do not allow net trampolines, which help avoid
capsizes in strong winds when the catamarans often sail at an
angle on one hull.
</P>
<P>
Bundock and Forbes's trampoline was also coated in plastic,
effectively keeping the strands of the net apart.
</P>
<P>
All boats and equipment are measured and weighed before
Olympic competition to ensure they are legal. About 400 men and
women from 69 countries will contest the 11-event regatta in nine
boat classes.

HEFEI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A piece of rice paper made in
east China's Anhui Province has been confirmed as the largest of

</P>
<P>
The paper, which is 6.62 meters long and 2.46 meters wide, was
made by China Rice Paper Corporation at Jingxian County in east

<P>
The high-quality paper was made using complex techniques and

<HEADLINE> Thai Auto Industry to Get Japanese Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The program is designed to encourage Japanese automakers with
their own production bases in Thailand, such as Toyota, to
localize more parts production in the country.
</P>
<P>
Toyota Motor Thailand recently revealed it planned to have its
parts 100 percent locally made by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Yoshihiro Otsuji, president of JETRO Bangkok, was quoted as
saying that 12 Japanese experts would come to Thailand next month
to support a program called "Thailand Automotive Industry Projects
for Building Competitive Strength."
</P>
<P>
The experts would form teams with Thai engineers with the ratio
of three Thai counterparts to one Japanese expert. A total of 150
auto-parts manufacturers in Thailand will be selected to join the
program, the first to be implemented in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The program is aimed at strengthening the competitiveness of
Thai auto-parts manufacturers, particularly in the intensified
competitive atmosphere once the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) has
been implemented," Otsuji said.
</P>
<P>
With the technology transferred from Japanese experts, Thailand
's exports of both auto parts and automobiles will become more
competitive because of improvements in quality, cost, delivery,
engineering, and management, he added.
</P>
<P>
Toyoharu Fujimoto, a member of the Japanese International
Cooperation Agency in Thailand, was quoted as saying that 80
percent of Thai auto-parts production was still lower than
international standards.
</P>
<P>
To survive the intensified competition, Thai parts
manufacturers would have to develop their own technology and
product design, calculate cost expense in every piece of product,
and create new raw materials, Fujimoto said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, right now only a few auto-parts producers
here can develop these types of activities.
</P>
<P>
Director of Thailand Automotive Institute Vallop Tiasiri was
quoted as saying that auto parts suppliers in Thailand were in 12
supporting industries, which provided the backbone of every
industrial sector in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Support from the JETRO program would, thus, help upgrade almost
every industrial sector in Thailand, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Laos Agree to Solve Islets Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Governments of Thailand and
Laos have agreed to solve a dispute over three islets in their
border river of Mekong, The Thai Foreign Ministry said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In their talks Wednesday, East Asian Affairs Director-General
of Thai Foreign Ministry Surapong Jayanama and Lao ambassador to
Thailand Hiem Phommachanh resolved to quickly end the row and
prevent it from growing into a new escalation of tensions between
the two countries,the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
This is the first governmental level talks over this dispute
between the two neighboring nations since it happened about a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
Hiem said he would report the Thai position back to his
government,but suggested to settle the problem at local level.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai government, on August 19, a group of Lao
militiamen occupied three small yet-to-be-demarcated islands in
the Mekong river between Thai north-most Chiangrai province, 785
kilometers north of Bangkok, and Lao Bo Keo provinces.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen then asked the Thai farmers to leave these
islets,where they used to grow maize during dry seasons.
</P>
<P>
Thai local officials have held two rounds of unsuccessful talks
with Lao counterparts on this issue, asking Laos to withdraw
militiamen and leave those islets what they used to be.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have agreed to demarcate their river border,
including the three islets, after they complete work on land
frontier.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Refuses to Attend Second Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto Thursday morning once again failed to attend his court
session with the same reason that his health is not fit.
</P>
<P>
This is the second trial for Soeharto on the charges of
corruption case.
</P>
<P>
The hearing started at 10:00 a.m. local time, but only several
private doctors and lawyers of the country's former ruler appeared
before the court at the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Chief judge and South Jakarta District Court chief Lalu Mariyun
opened the trial and said Thursday's hearing will hear the
explanation of Soeharto's doctors on his health condition.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Lalu Mariyun said the former strongman must
appear in court if his health condition has improved. But Soeharto
's lawyers said it should depend on the doctors' medical check-up.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's health has been the subject of much discussion since
the 79-year-old former ruler failed to appear at the much-awaited
August 31 opening session on his corruption trial. Soeharto's
defense team said that "poor health" prevented their client from
attending the session.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's lawyers claimed that their client is mentally and
physically unable to face a trial after he suffered three small
strokes last year.
</P>
<P>
As the absence of Soeharto at the first hearing on August 31,
the South Jakarta District Court finally adjourned the trial
process to September 14.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who ruled the country for 32 years, is alleged to
have misused some 58 million U.S. dollars of public funds in the
seven charitable foundations he chaired.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Earns Over 43.6 Mln U. S. Dollars from Gems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka exported 3.42
billion rupees (around 43.6 million U.S. dollars) worth of gems
and jewelry during the first six months of this year which
represents an 85 percent growth over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Purchasing 24 percent of gem exports the United States has
replaced Japan as Sri Lanka's largest gem buyer.
</P>
<P>
The export of gems and jewelry in Sri Lanka has achieved an
annual growth rate of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Gem and Jewelry Authority has conducted several promotional
campaigns in The United Kingdom and the United States which have
yielded excellent results, according to the Authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Colored Gems Stone Association is
also engaged in a promotional campaign of Sri Lankan gemstones
internationally.
</P>
<P>
As part of the promotional campaigns, the Sri Lanka Gem Traders
Association organized a three-day gems and jewelry show named "
Facet 2000." The show, which was been held annually for 10
consecutive years, concluded here Wednesday. Vice President of the
International Colored Stone Association Joseph M. Menzie was
invited to attend on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
In her message to the show, President Kumaratunga said that she
was sure that the effort will give the necessary boost to the gem
and jewelry industry and make this sector one of the principal
export sectors of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's gems considered the best in the world, suffered a
set-back during the Asian financial crisis but has been picking up
since then.
</P>
<P>
While Thailand is considered the largest exporter of gems
produced artificially, the Sri Lankan gems, which are natural, are
noted for their quality.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Develop 3 Road Links with Neighboring Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister to the Prime Minister's Office Adisai Bhodharamik was
quoted as saying here on Thursday that he discussed the project
with his Myanmar counterpart Sor Win at a recent meeting in which
both sides agreed and set a rough timeframe for the implementation
of the project.
</P>
<P>
Adisai, who oversees the Thai tourism, said that the government
would give priority to the three-road project over other regional
road projects, as the three road links have high potential to
promote tourism, trade and investment between Thailand and
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The first road link will be between Thailand's western province
of Kanchanaburi and Myanmar's town of Tavoy, providing the west of
the country with access to and from Myanmar; the second will be
between Thailand's Mae Sot district in Tak province and Myanmar's
town of Pa-An, offering communications between Thailand's central
and northern areas and Myanmar; and the third will be between
Thailand's Mae Sai district in Chiang Rai province through Myanmar
and China's southern areas, he described.
</P>
<P>
The government would seek low-interest loans to finance the
project, which is expected to help boost Chinese arrivals in
Thailand, and encourage more Thai tourist arrivals in Myanmar, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Adisai noted that the three-road-link project, whose details on
distances and sources of funds have yet been finalized, would also
help support Thailand's plan to become a communication center for
mainland Southeast Asia in the future.

<HEADLINE> Supply Increase Won't Bring Down Oil Prices: OPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- President of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Ali Rodriguez denied
Wednesday that further increases in oil production can bring down
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he warned that an irrational increase of
production that does not reflect a real rise in demand could
result in an oversupply, which could potentially lead to an oil
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that an energy crisis could loom in the medium
term if worldwide refining and production capacity doesn't grow.
</P>
<P>
OPEC sealed a new production pact on Sunday which will boost
its oil output by 800,000 barrels per day. The total OPEC oil
production will then reach 26.2 million barrels a day, up from 25.
4 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
However, after the decision for an increase in oil output was
released on Monday, the October contracts for North Sea Brent
crude climbed 84 cents to 33.62 dollars a barrel in London, while
light, sweet crude prices increased by 1.51 dollars to 35.14
dollars a barrel in New York, reaching its highest price since
1990.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have been hanging far over the OPEC reference price
band of 22-28 U.S. dollars this year, raising concerns both in oil
producing and consuming countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, after raising OPEC oil output for the third time
this year, OPEC president said that the increase of 800,000
barrels a day will be enough to meet world demand for crude.
</P>
<P>
He also said that "several OPEC countries are already nearing
their capacity ceiling" and that the low refining capacity and
high taxes are principal factors that have led to the increasing
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
In many oil-consuming countries where fuel prices have recently
been soaring, there has been growing concern and even outrage. In
France, for example, truckers and taxi drivers have set up road
blockades to protest rising gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
Faced with mounting pressure from protesters, leaders from
western countries have been demanding OPEC to boost its oil
output to provide more supply to the world market.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair believes that the recent rise
in fuel prices may be attributed in part to world oil prices. He
said that "the sensible way, the only right way to deal with this
problem, is to put pressure on OPEC."
</P>
<P>
Because the oil problems involve more than one party in the
world, Rodriguez said that OPEC ministers are willing to talk with
consumers.
</P>
<P>
The seventh energy conference, a famous producer-consumer
meeting, will be held November 17 in Riyadh. The conference is
expected to be a good opportunity for more discussions between oil
producing and consuming countries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Soccer Body Says Nandar Still Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Soccer Association of
Indonesia (PSSI) ended the controversy over a possible replacement
of the national team coach, announcing on Wednesday that Nandar
Iskandar would continue coaching the team for the 2000 Asian Cup
in Lebanon and the Tiger Cup in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
PSSI Secretary General Tri Goestono said that the association's
official in charge of athletes development Nurdin Halid had been
appointed chef de mission for the Asian Cup and Tiger Cup.
</P>
<P>
National team director Muhammad Zein was assigned as team
manager, he said, adding that Nandar would still be assisted by
Rudy Keltjes, Dananjaya and special goalkeeping assistant Arjuna
Rinaldi.
</P>
<P>
Tri said the decision was taken at a meeting with PSSI chairman
Agum Gumelar Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Reports said some PSSI officials had indicated the association
would appoint Dutchman Henk Wullems as a technical advisor.
Wullems had also been expected to take over Nandar's job as head
coach.
</P>
<P>
"There is no technical advisor," Tri was quoted by Thursday's
Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tri explained that the plan to hire a technical advisor had
been on Nurdin's agenda since January.
</P>
<P>
"Wullems is one of the candidates for this job. He has proved
his quality by leading PSM Makassar to win the Bank Mandiri soccer
league. But we have not signed any contract with Wullems. Based
on our discussion, we plan to invite him to coach the national
team for the pre-qualifying round of the 2002 World Cup," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zein said wullems has helped the national team to arrange
friendly matches with clubs in the Netherlands prior to the team
competing in the Asian Cup, which takes place from October 12 to
29 in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We will leave for the Netherlands sometime between September
22 and 23. We will play in five friendlies. We have received
confirmation from two clubs in the Netherlands, Vitesse Arnhem and
Breda. Wullems will return to his country on Thursday and he will
arrange three more matches. We are waiting for an answer from
Roda JC Kerkrade," he was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zein said Wullems had asked for no payment in return for his
services.
</P>
<P>
The team will fly directly to Beirut from Amsterdam on
September 8.
</P>
<P>
Zein said the team, which now consists of 26 players, would be
reduced to 22 players before the friendlies.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia aims to improve its position in the Asian Cup. In
its debut in the 1996 Cup final, Indonesia came bottom of Group A
after the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and South Korea. This year,
Indonesia is in Group B with South Korea, China and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
As regards the Tiger Cup, Zein said his team's target was to
reach the final.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly speaking, we are one or two notches below South Korea,
China and Kuwait. We hope we can achieve a better result compared
to the 1996 event. For the Tiger Cup, we want to be one of the
finalists as in the previous two Cups, we never got that far," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Thai Boxers to Test Luck in Olympic Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- As hundreds of sport-loving
Australians line up the streets of Sydney Thursday morning to wait
the Olympic Flames, dozens of Thais will flock into the Darling
Harbor Coliseum there to witness the much-awaited draw for the
Olympic boxing comeptition, Thai sport authorities said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
So far, boxing is the sole Olympic sport where Thais have even
won medals. Since Payao Poontarat broke the ice in the 1976
Montreal Olympics by taking a bronze in lightweight category,
Thailand has been regularly enjoying success at the quadrennial
Games.
</P>
<P>
In the Atlanta Games four years ago, the Thais enjoyed bigger
success when Somluck Kamsing won a gold and Vichai Rachanon earned
a bronze.
</P>
<P>
This year in Sydney, Thai boxers wish to do even better. The
five gold-medal performance at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok and
their triumph with ten titles in last year's Southeast Asian Games
have greatly boosted their confidence.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has had nine qulifiers in 12 weight categories, which
represented a largest ever Thai boxing team in the Olympics Games.
</P>
<P>
And Thursday's draw would be a vital test as it determines who
would be their early opponents and whether they had to face any
difficult fights in the early rounds.
</P>
<P>
Somluck of the 57kg category, who is seeking to win his second
Olympic title in Sydney, would have more chances if he could avoid
clashes with tough fighters such as those Cuba, Kazakhstan, Mexico,
Ukraine and Uzbekistan, in early stages.
</P>
<P>
Among others are 48kg boxer Suban Punon of the 48kg category,
Wijan Ponlid of the 51kg, and Sontaya Wongprates and Pongsit
Wianguiset.
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be an exciting Olympic Games for us and I am
sure our fighters will do their best, " says Thai boxing team
manager Thavatchai Sajjakul.

SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Pole vault world record holder
Sergei Bubka of Ukraine blasted unpredictable weather on Thursday,
saying that windy conditions could put himself and his fellow pole
vaulters in danger during the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Bubka, the greatest ever of the sport, believes that the
conditions will wreak havoc with the competition, describing them
as "a nightmare".
</P>
<P>
"During the run-up the wind can blow in three different
directions at the same time," said Bubka, the world record holder
indoors and outdoors.
</P>
<P>
"You can cope with a regular wind but when it is blowing
strongly, in gusts, and when it is changing direction it's not
nice and it is even dangerous. There could be a lot of surprises,"
he said.

SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- German distance runner Dieter
Baumann will have to wait another 24 hours before knowing his fate
as the the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF)
arbitration panel hearing into his drugs offence was adjourned
until Friday.
</P>
<P>
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said the panel had postponed its
hearing until Friday morning to allow the 1992 Barcelona Olympic 5,
000 meters champion to present his case in person.
</P>
<P>
Baumann, 35, tested positive last November for the anabolic

claiming his toothpaste had been spiked.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF council did not accept his explanation and sent the
case to its arbitration panel.

<HEADLINE> United States to Launch New Appeal for Perez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee
will make second effort to appeal, asking the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow kayaker Angel Perez, who competed
for Cuba in the 1992 Olympics, to compete in Sydney, officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Arbitration for Sport on Wednesday became the
latest panel to reject Perez's eligibility because he has been a U.
S.citizen less than a year, far short of the three years mandated
by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has other such cases to deal with, including two Cuban-
born Spanish athletes, who are now barred from competing in Sydney
by Cuba under the three-year rule.
</P>
<P>
The USOC says that Perez has been a national since 1993. The
issue centers on the distinction the IOC makes between a national
and a citizen. Perez gained citizenship in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Li Ji, the only survivor of
coach Ma Junren's training camp for the Olympic Games, could win a
medal from the women's 10,000 meters if she is in good form, a top
Chinese athletics official said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Shang Xiutang, general secretary of Chinese Athletics
Association, said there will be no problems for the 19-year-old Li
to finish among the top five or eight. "If she maintains good form,
it will be possible to win a medal."
</P>
<P>
Shang said that Li had returned to Dalian with coach Ma from
Duoba training camp in Qinghai Province. "She is still coached by
Ma," Shang said.
</P>
<P>
Li, whose personal best time is only 32 mintues 14.97 seconds,
will find it very hard to bring a medal from Sydney. Her top
rivals will be defending champion Fernanda Ribeiro of Portugal and
world marathon record holder Tegla Loroupe of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's Derartu Tulu and Gete Wami, and Ireland's veteran
Sonia O'Sullivan will also pose serious threat to the Chinese
Olympic debutant.

<HEADLINE> Sotomayor Remains Gold Hopeful in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Despite a two-year ban, Cuban
high jumper Javier Sotomayor remained to be a top contender for
the gold medal in the Sydney Olympic Games, said his coach
Guillermo de la Torres.
</P>
<P>
"Although he hasn't competed in enough meets due to the late
lifting of the ban by the IAAF, he had good performances in the
latest warmups and justified his ability to take the gold medal in
the Olympics," said the coach.
</P>
<P>
De la Torres claimed that anyone who would jump to 2.38 meters
will take the gold medal at the Millennium Olympics and Sotomayor
has the full confidence of landing in that distance.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old world record holder, whose two-year ban for
taking cocaine was halved to allow him to compete at the Sydney
Olympics, told reporters he had recovered from a leg strain upon
arrival on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor, the 1992 Barcelona Olympic champion, tested positive
for the recreational stimulant at the Pan-American Games last year,
and was banned for two years by the International Amateur Athletic
Federation's (IAAF) arbitration panel before the IAAF ruling
council decided last month to halve the ban on humanitarian
grounds and allow Sotomayor to take part in what he has said will
be his last Games.
</P>
<P>
Setting the world record of 2.45 meters in 1993 after early
record in 1988 and 1989, Sotomayor is a phenomenal athlete who has
cleared 2.30 meters or better in 229 meetings with 89 times at 2.
35 meters or more and 21 at 2.40 meters or more since 1984.
</P>
<P>
He had knee and ankle operations after the 1996 Atlanta Games,
and his wife Maria del Carmen was also a high jumper. They have
one son named Javier Junior.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Greek triple jump national
champion Stamatis Lenis, who brought with him a substance banned
in Australia, was stopped by customs police,the Greek Olympic
Committee spokesman said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman George Liveris stressed that it was not on
the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) list of outlawed
performance-enhancing drugs and Lenis would be allowed to compete
at the Sydney Games. "He was stopped in Perth on September 9 with
a box which had Russian lettering on it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The police didn't know what it was so they sent it to
Canberra for tests. The Russian product is called Ekdisten, which
is a natural and not a chemical product.
</P>
<P>
"But the results from Canberra showed that Ekdisten contains
Ecdysterone, which is outlawed in Australia."
</P>
<P>
He said he was unable to give further information about the
product or what it contained.
</P>
<P>
He added both the IOC and local organising committee SOCOG had
given Lenis the green light to compete although the athlete could
still be prosecuted in an Australian criminal court.
</P>
<P>
Lenis was due to arrive in Sydney from Perth with the Greek
athletics team on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Confident of Meeting New oil Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
expressed its optimism that the country would be able to boost
crude oil production by 41,000 barrels per day (bpd) to meet the
new oil production quota.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, along with other members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), would raise its oil output
by October 1, the Jakarta Post daily Thursday quoted Minister for
Energy and Mineral Resources Purnomo Yusgiantoro as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Not only Indonesia, other OPEC members also need time to
prepare their oil fields," the minister said at a seminar held
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
OPEC announced on Sunday that it would raise its oil output by
800,000 bpd to help lower soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after the price of oil reached a 10-year
record high of 35 U.S. dollars a barrel in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The new quota will raise Indonesia's oil production to 1.5
million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Indonesia had been called to raise oil
output by 37,000 bpd as part of OPEC's policy of raising output by
500,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's state oil company Pertamina said that it
had difficulties meeting the additional 37,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
Most oil fields in Indonesia are marginal ones and are already
pumping oil at full capacity, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Purnomo admitted that new investment was needed to raise oil
production so as to meet the new quota.

SEOUL, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Each South Korean holds 15.36
million won (13,780 U.S. dollars) of financial assets in banks or
securities, the Bank of Korea said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Out of South Korea's total financial assets of 2.91 trillion
dollars at the end of 1999, the private financial ones took up 22.
3 percent.

However, the central bank said the amount was substantially

<P>
Japan's total financial assets amounted to 42.61 trillion

</P>
<P>
South Koreans tend to invest in real estate rather than savings
accounts or stocks, which has resulted in the low figures, said a

<HEADLINE> Dream Team Keep Others to Vie for Olympic Silver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The American Dream Team, full
of NBA stars, is the sure bet to take its third consecutive gold
in the men's Olympic basketball, keeping a batch of nations to
battle for silver and bronze.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 when NBA players were admitted to the Games, the
Dream Teams have left only one puzzle for the audience on the
margin of their each victory in the Olympics, and such will be the
case in Syndey.
</P>
<P>
Although Andrew Gaze of Australia claimed the Americans are
beatable, the U.S. men cagers have enjoyed a 40-0 clean slate in
the Olympic history since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The margin of victory for the third Dream Team in five
exhibition games was an incredible 35.2 points, despite a hard
drop from the 43.8 points Michael Jordan and Larry Bird posted in
Barcelona in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, the Dream Team has the youngest of any NBA-laden
Olympic squad with an average age of 26.7 years.
</P>
<P>
Reigning world Champions and 1996 silver medallists Yugoslavia
are expected to stage the closest clashes against the Americans,
with Sacremento Kings swingman Predrag Stojakovic and former Miami
Heat guard Predrag Danilovic supplying the scoring punch.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Australia also boasts of four NBA players of Phoenix Suns
center Luc Longley, Chris Anstey of the Chicago Bulls, former
Minnesota Timberwolves guard Shane Heal and former San Antonio
Spur Gaze.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania, twice bronze medalists in the past two Olympics,
will cause problems for other teams despite the absence of
Portland Trailblazer center Arvydas Sabonis, Cleveland Cavalier
center Zydrunas Ilgauskas and European all-star Arturas Karnisovas
due to injury.

SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- By choosing women's triathlon
as the first medal event, the hosts Australia are surely to take
the first gold at the Millennium Olympics to be officially opened
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
As the hosts dominate the world rankings of the event,
Australians even tempt for a clean sweep of the top three in the
sport that will make its Olympic debut on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Australians will be represented by world number one
Michellie Jones, world championship winner Nicole Hackett and last
year's world champion Loretta Harrop, even former double world
champion Emma Carney was excluded from the squad.
</P>
<P>
The Australian women filled the top five places at last year's
world championships but two had to miss out because of the quota
of three competitors per country and region.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Immigrants Fail to Enter Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of would-be illegal
immigrants, who tried to use Olympic tickets as a cover to get
into Australia, failed their efforts, a spokesman for Immigration
Minister Philip Ruddock said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that some people in two eastern European countries had
even tried to pass themselves off as athletes and officials going
to the Sydney Games to try to get visas.
</P>
<P>
"In one case, eight people said they were representing their
country in a martial arts event at the Olympics. The country
concerned didn't even have a federation for that particular
martial art," the Reuters quoted him as saying. But the spokesman
did not give names of the countries.
</P>
<P>
He said about 60 people in Syria had also fallen victim to
confidence a trickster who had told them he had packages of
Olympic tickets and Australian visas that would guarantee them a
passport to a better life Down Under.
</P>
<P>
Official accreditation to the Sydney Games, which open on
Friday, is used as a tourist visa to Australia for the 40,000
athletes, officials and journalists who have flooded in for the 17-
day Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Foreign visitors who buy event tickets abroad need to apply
separately for tourist visas through Australian consular offices
before starting out on their journey.

<HEADLINE> China's Sports Spokeswoman: Doping Offences Pollute Sports World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Olympic delegation
spokeswoman cried here Thursday that the doping offences including
EPO has polluted the world sports, forcing all the concerned to
thoroughly justify "Where are the sports going to today".
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, He Huixian, a former
sports reporter, reiterated that "our anti-doping campaign will
never tolerate any offender including EPO cheaters and will resort
to every measure possible to uphold the fairness to the clear
athletes, to the audience and to the sports reporters as well."
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman complained that some foreign media mis-
interpreted China's dismissal of its 27 athletes from the Olympics,
stressing that "China has been strengthening its utmost efforts to
crack down any doping cheater, and has never and will never spare
any efforts in its anti-doping battle."
</P>
<P>
"China is one of the front-runners to introduce the EPO tests
in seven sports since 1998 when the campaign to bid for the 2008
Olympics has not yet started, and has conducted 315 blood tests in
1999 with six positive cases," the sports official said.
</P>
<P>
"Just like France, China disqualified the six athletes to keep
abreast with its steady stance of protecting the health of the
athletes and of upholding the principle of fair competition, and
so do the case here in Sydney."
</P>
<P>
On the reason why the names of the dismissed athletes were
withheld, the spokeswoman explained that "we can't declare them as
positive until their doping procedures be over, and they should be
granted another chance as they are still very young."
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, the sports world has been polluted by EPO and other
drugs that betray conventional scientific measures," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
"All the countries should take care of their own things first
instead of fixing their eyes on the others, and the sports can be
free of pollution only after everyone concerned takes his own
efforts first," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"Those who tolerated their own doping offenders, surely failed
to uphold their anti-doping principles, and can be reasonably
considered as the nests of more doping offenders than those who
consistently carried out their tests and brought justice to those
offenders on time."

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed in Violence in Aceh, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The attacks included the bombing of the Aceh deputy police
chief's residence on Tuesday night. The attack caused no
fatalities but shattered the rear windows and damaged the garage.
</P>
<P>
The bombing follows the trend of attacks being made on homes of
senior officers as seven hours earlier two armed civilians threw a
grenade at the house of North Aceh Police chief Superintendent
Abadan Bangko.
</P>
<P>
North Aceh GAM (the Free Aceh Movement) leader Abu Sofyan Daud
admitted that GAM was responsible for the attack which was
launched following the police's refusal to withdraw the Mobile
Brigade forces probing GAM headquarters in Sawang and Nisam
districts.
</P>
<P>
While the bomb attacks did not result in any fatalities,
separate attacks across the province claimed five lives.
</P>
<P>
GAM spokesman Amni bin Marzuki Ahmad Wednesday also admitted
they kidnapped the 16-year-old son of Aceh Besar Police Chief
Sayed Husaini.
</P>
<P>
The escalating violence, which police claim is being
perpetrated by the rebel GAM, remains unabated despite the
extension of the humanitarian pause on September 2.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government and the GAM have reached an agreement
to extend their three-month cease-fire accord which expired on
September 2.
</P>
<P>
But new Defense Minister Muhamad Mahfud M.D. last week said the
government would not extend the accord beyond December because the
rebels have used it to strengthen their forces.
</P>
<P>
Mahfud said GAM had used the reduced level of violence since
June to stockpile thousands of weapons and build up its combat
forces.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in Aceh have been fighting for 25 years for independence,
a greater share of oil profits and the right to impose Islamic
religious laws. Thousands have been killed in decades of fighting
between Indonesian security forces and Aceh rebels.

<HEADLINE> Eight Killed by Colombian Paramilitary Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were killed
Wednesday by Colombian right-wing paramilitary groups in two
massacres in rural zones of the Valle del Cauca department,
located in northern Colombia, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Regional police spokesmen said the crimes were committed by
alleged members of the "self-defense peasants" in Tulua and
Jamundi municipalities in the Valle del Cauca department.
</P>
<P>
The hooded paramilitary members entered "La Marina" in Tulua,
105 kilometers north of Cali, Wednesday, killing two adults and a
16-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
Four more persons were killed by another similar squad during
its attack on the "La Esmeralda de Jamundi" neighborhood, 25
kilometers south of Cali, on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the motives for the two killings were not
clear and that they were not sure whether the two cases were
related.
</P>
<P>
The "self-defense" groups have disputed with leftist guerrillas
over the control of several territories in Colombia. The
paramilitary groups began attacking leftist militants, trade
unionists and alleged collaborators of insurgents more than one
year ago.

<P>
BOGOTA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's largest rebel force,
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), derailed a
train belonging to a U.S. company with explosives, Colombian
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred between the El Cesar and the Magdalena
departments in northern Columbia when a train carrying 4,000 tons
coal passed by. The FARC used some 200 kilograms of explosives.
</P>
<P>
The train, comprising two locomotives and 80 wagons, left from
La Jagua de Ibirico, a place in El Cesar near the northwestern
border with Venezuela, where Drummond Ltd. exploits coal lodes.
</P>
<P>
The destination of the shipment was a port of the U.S. company
along the Caribbean coast, near the Santa Marta Maritime Terminal.
</P>
<P>
The explosives derailed one of the locomotives and 22 wagons,
causing the spilling of 1,100 tons of coal and the destruction of
some 150 meters of railroad track.
</P>
<P>
The rebels took the train operators hostage. They were
identified as Luis Castro, Pedro and Rafael Tapias. Authorities
attribute the action to Front 19 of the FARC Caribbean bloc, the
oldest and strongest guerrilla faction in the country, said the
authorities.

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Threatens Chile's Fruit Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Consecutive days of cold
weather, strong winds and continuous rainfall have dampened the
prospects of Chile's fresh fruit export industry in the 2000/2001
season, the Chilean Fruit Development Foundation said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The central and southern valleys, where more than 80 percent of
the country's fresh fruits grow, have been seriously hit by the
bad weather, the foundation said.
</P>
<P>
Apple and pear orchards are the most affected fruit varieties
because the cold, rainy weather has prevented bees from doing
their crucial pollination work during the peak flowering period.
</P>
<P>
"The volumes of apples and pears, especially late varieties,
will be undoubtedly undermined by this weather," said Carlos
Caballero, an agricultural agronomist of the Fruit Development
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
"The bees are simply not moving. Still, the flowering this year
has been so abundant that it is hard to determine how this will
finally work itself out," added the expert.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the exports of the stone fruit -- plums, apricots
and peaches -- and the table grapes could also be damaged if the
temperature dips below the freezing point. So far the thermometer
has hovered just above freezing.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried because it rained a lot, and the cold weather
continues to linger," said one central valley grower.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of snow in the mountains. The cold could delay
the season. Our greatest fear is that the temperature will fall.
The table grape vines are already sprouting, and any freeze now
could have a catastrophic effect on them and our stone fruit
production."
</P>
<P>
Fresh fruit exports are Chile's third most important industry
after copper and manufacturing, netting the country 1.4 billion U.
S. dollars in returns each year and providing 50 percent of all
the fresh fruit consumed in northern hemisphere countries during
their winter months from November through March.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chile exported 1.45 million tons of fresh fruits to
markets around the world, mostly to North America, Europe and Asia.
That figure has remained constant in the past four seasons.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Central Bank
Wednesday revised down its forecast for the country's economic
growth for this year and 2001.
</P>
<P>
In a document presented to the senate, the bank predicted that
the gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow 5.6 percent
in 2000, down 0.3 percentage points from the previous estimation
made in May.
</P>
<P>
For the year 2001, the economic growth would be 5.7 percent,
compared with the 6.2 percent predicted earlier.
</P>
<P>
"The slowdown was attributed to the depression in consumption
and investment," the central bank's President Carlos Massad said.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that by the end of this year, the county's
annual inflation will stand at 4.6 percent, surpassing the target
of 3.5 percent set by the central bank last September.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP fell 1.1 percent in 1999, the first drop in
two decades. It began to pick up and grew by 5.8 percent in the
first half of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Belgian protesting truckers
Wednesday agreed to end nationwide blockades gradually after the
government promised to look for ways to solve the problem of
rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
"They have agreed to progressively dismantle the blockade,"
Belgian Transport Minister Isabelle Durant told reporters about
the negotiations with deputies of truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
She said the transport sector had agreed to drop their demands
for tax cuts on diesel in exchange for other measures to help
relieve the burden of fuel costs inflated by rising world oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
"The government is to search for alternative ways in fiscal and
social security areas to compensate for the losses suffered by the
sector this year," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Serge Adriaens, head of the Professional Union for Road
Transport, who has led the four-day "stranglehold" on Brussels,
also said that progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations have come out of the deep freeze and are back in
the refrigerator," said Adriaens, who had stormed out of earlier
meetings with government officials.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the blockades would remain in place for
now, although that could change within hours.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Sunday, Belgian truckers have been blocking main
roads into the capital, the European Union's headquarters,
demanding cuts in excise duty on diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
The protests spread throughout the country, bringing motorway
traffic to a standstill in both the Dutch-speaking north and major
southern cities. The Belgian-German frontier near Aachen was also
sealed off.
</P>
<P>
The transport sector demanded a cut by 1.87 Belgian francs (0.
04 U.S. dollar) per liter over excise duties.
</P>
<P>
Adriaens and representatives of other national truckers' unions
met Durant, Finance Minister Didier Reyndeers and Economics
Minister Charles Picque earlier to hammer out draft proposals.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Predicts Oil Prices to Remain High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Mexican Secretary of
Energy Luis Tellez said on Wednesday that oil prices will remain
relatively high during the next six months, despite the supply
increase agreed upon by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Everybody is wondering how the market will react to OPEC's
Monday decision to increase supply to 800,000 barrels per day
starting October 1, Tellez told the press.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices will remain high due to a large global demand
resulting from overheating economies. But prices may not reach as
high as the present 35 dollars per barrel, added Tellez.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Mexico will not immediately contribute
to the world oil supply because of the strong domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is the fifth largest world producer with a 3.5 percent
share of the total output, and Mexico is an important, but not
determining actor, in fixing oil prices, according to the energy
secretary.
</P>
<P>
Tellez said that the high prices of crude will not only
increase Mexico's hard currency income considerably, but will also
damage local consumers, slow down the world economy, and result in
future negative consequences for the country.
</P>
<P>
Mexico will supply an additional 200,000 barrels a day in the
last quarter of this year, and 300,000 by March of 2001, Tellez
said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico produced 3.01 million barrels a day (bpd) of oil in the
first half of this year. Although Mexico, like Norway, is not a
member of OPEC, the country continues to communicate with OPEC
about oil prices.

<P>
"China is one of the front-runners to introduce the EPO tests
in seven sports since 1998 when the campaign to bid for the 2008
Olympics has not yet started, and has conducted 315 blood tests in
1999 with six positive cases," the sports official said.
</P>
<P>
"Just like France, China disqualified the six athletes to keep
abreast with its steady stance of protecting the health of the
athletes and of upholding the principle of fair competition, and
so do the case here in Sydney."
</P>
<P>
On the reason why the names of the dismissed athletes were
withheld, the spokeswoman explained that "we cann't declare them
as positive until their doping procedures have be over, and they
should be granted another chance as they are still very young."
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, the sports world has been polluted by EPO and other
drugs that betray conventional scientific measures," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
"All the countries should take care of their own things first
instead of fixing their eyes on the others, and the sports can be
free of pollution only after everyone concerned takes his own
efforts first," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"Those who tolerated their own doping offenders, surely failed
to uphold their anti-doping principles, and can be reasonably
considered as the nests of more doping offenders than those who
consistently carried out their tests and brought justice to those
offenders on time."

<P>
HEFEI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have discovered
about 20 ancient wine, cloth-making, tea, edible oil and bean curd
workshops in east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The workshops are located in the village of Gaoluting, Shitai
County.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of the 20th century, wine made in the village
was popular in Shanghai, Yangzhou and other major cities in China
and were even exported to southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Centuries ago, most of the shops in the village had a workshop
in their backyards.
</P>
<P>
The well-preserved workshops, which used primitive production
technology, are important for researchers to study the customs of
southern Anhui.

<HEADLINE> "True Tomb" of Ancient Mongolia Founder Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region recently
discovered what they believe is the tomb of Genghis Khan, who
founded ancient Mongolia and whose grandson Kublai Khan
established the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).
</P>
<P>
The tomb is located in Qinghe County in northern Xinjiang. For
years archeologists have theorized the body of Genghis Khan was
buried at a place in Mount. Altay. The tomb is flanked by two
lakes, which are connected with a man-made canal.
</P>
<P>
"This is the real tomb of Genghis Khan. The tomb at the Gandeli
steppe in southwestern Inner Mongolia was not the burial ground of
this ancient Mongol ruler," said Zhang Hui, a research fellow at
the Xinjiang Museum.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian strategist died of illness in 1227 at Liupanshan,
in today's Gansu province, and was buried in secret by his
generals according to Mongol tradition in his hometown. Mongol
studies specialists around the world have never agreed on where he
was buried.
</P>
<P>
About 400 meters away from the newly-found grave stands a 20-
meter-high tomb with a diameter of 78 meters. A number of Chinese
historians and archeologists inferred it was the tomb of one of
Genghis Khan's grandsons.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, Genghis Khan came to Altay
with his troops on six occasions. Still in existence are the ruins
of a four-lane road for his troops and army tents.
</P>
<P>
Whether this is the real tomb of Genghis Khan needs further
investigation, Zhang Hui said.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Wood Layer Found on Island in E. China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
discovered a large ancient wood layer dating back 8,500 years in
the soil of Zhujiajian in the Zhoushan isles in the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The layer is a good evidence for the rise of sea level
worldwide during the period 8,000 and 6,000 years ago, caused by
the smelting of the icecap in Greenland.
</P>
<P>
The layer is also important for the research of the ancient
climate, living creatures and culture.
</P>
<P>
The layer is 3.3 meters deep and more than 100 meters long,
with traces of ancient tree stems, leaves, fruits, seeds,
sporopollen and insects.
</P>
<P>
There are scores of varieties of trees in the layer, including
pine, fir and oak. The largest is a Chinese sweet gum, which has a
diameter of 85 centimeters and 5.6 meters tall.
</P>
<P>
Viewed under a microscope, the insects look green.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that the layer was a part of an ancient
forest.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Chinese University of Science and
Technology have also found seven pieces of pottery which might
belong to the period between 2,500 and 6,200 years ago, as well as
pieces of charcoal.
</P>
<P>
The finds are important for the research of the links between
the Hemudu culture some 7,000 years ago in Zhejiang province and
the ancient culture on the islands.
</P>
<P>
The university is carrying out further research on the layer in
cooperation with multidisciplinary experts.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments are considering to build a park to
popularize the findings, sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China's Copyright Law should
be refined to build on the copyright protection the law already
has offered in its past 10 years, according to some officials and
legal experts.
</P>

situations due to rapid economic, scientific and cultural
development, said National Copyright Administration Commissioner
Yu Youxian at a 10th anniversary conference Wednesday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
More provisions must be added because the anti-piracy
regulations are not strong enough to resist nowadays rampant
piracy, said Yu.

<P>
The increase of digital networks and multimedia also require
copyright protection.

OTTAWA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A leading Canadian crime
reporter was shot five times in the back Wednesday in Montreal and
miraculously survived the attempted murder, Canadian police said.
</P>
<P>
Michel Auger, 55, was gunned down at about 11 a.m. local time
in the parking lot of his employer Le Journal de Montreal.
</P>
<P>
The veteran journalist managed to ring the emergency 911 number
with his cell phone after the gunman fled the scene.
</P>
<P>
He was rushed to hospital for treatment of wounds which
doctors say have no risk of life. He is now reported in stable
condition.
</P>
<P>
Police said a surveillance camera had caught the gunman
getting out of a white car, which was found abandoned later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
The murder attempt came a day after the newspaper featured a
two-page expose by Auger on organized crime.
</P>
<P>
"It could be bikers or the Mafia or another criminal gang,"
said one of his colleagues working with the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Having written about criminal groups over the years, Auger is
considered a local authority on Quebec's criminal biker gangs and
Mafia organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China will kick off its
Olympic women's soccer campaign Thursday afternoon, one day before
the formal opening ceremony of the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup runner-up Chinese team will take on Nigeria in
Canberra while China's arch-rivals reigning champions the United
States, inspired by Mia Hamm, will play in Melbourne against
Norway, which is considered by many as dark horses for the women's
title.
</P>
<P>
The men's tournament sees favourites Brazil kick-off their
quest for a first Olympic gold at the Brisbane Cricket Ground with
what should be a routine opener against Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Organisers will be praying the remainder of the Games goes as
smoothly as Wednesday' opening matches.
</P>
<P>
There have been fears the event could be targeted by terror
groups and protestors who have disrupted the World Economic Forum,
but officials reported no major security-related incidents at
Wednesday's opening.
</P>
<P>
While the men's and women's events football gets into full
swing, Sydney is eagerly bracing itself for the official opening
of the games.
</P>
<P>
The city has been swept up in a frenzy of flame fever as the
Olympic Torch nears the end of its globe-trotting journey which
climaxes at Friday night's opening extravaganza at Stadium
Australia.
</P>
<P>
More than 70,000 people poured onto streets on Wednesday to
wish the flame on its way, as a succession of stars including
Australian rugby legend David Campese took part in the relay.
</P>
<P>
Organisers are tipping a bigger turnout Thursday as the flame
winds its way past the city's world-famous Opera house and through
Sydney's business district, before being officially welcomed in
the Olympic City.
</P>
<P>
Australian tennis star Pat Rafter is expected to take part in
the torch relay Thursday before scuttling off to prepare for the
Olympic tennis tournament which starts next week.
</P>
<P>
Rafter's bid for Olympic gold has been made slightly easier by
a spate of pullouts from the event.
</P>
<P>
The latest to tumble from the reckoning were Morocco's Hicham
Arazi and Younes El Aynaoui, who joined Switzerland's 1992 Olympic
gold medallist Marc Rosset and 1996 winner Andre Agassi on the
missing list.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai To Allocate 15 Billion Yuan for Water Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China's largest economic and
financial center, Shanghai, is to allocate 15 billion yuan (about
180 million U.S. dollars) within three years, for water source
protection and waste water treatment, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zuxin, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Environment
Protection Bureau, said that the China financial center will use
the money to protect the water source for people's daily use in
the upper reaches of the Huangpu River running through the city,
and also to deal with industrial waste water.
</P>
<P>
Among several sources of pollution in the Huangpu River, 42
percent is from sewage, 40 percent is from agriculture, and 18
percent is from industry. To ensure water quality, the municipal
government will set up waste water treatment works, and limit the
use of fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that in the last few years, the municipality has
invested an average of more than 10 billion yuan every year, three
percent of its gross domestic product, to deal with gas discharges
and solid waste treatment and to have more green vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to continuous efforts during the last three decades, 93
percent of the city's industrial waste water has been treated
before flowing into the river.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The organising committee of
the Sydney Olympic Games have sold 5.86 million tickets but still
have 1.6 million tickets left.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest inventory released by the SOCOG on
Wednesday, 1.64 million tickets are still available to fans across
the full range of sports.
</P>
<P>
According to the organisers, up to 4,000 swimming tickets, 100,
000 athletics tickets and 15,000 tickets for the closing ceremony
are available despite the last-minute sales rush.
</P>
<P>
Rhythmic gymnastics tops the list of the most popular sports as
more than 99 percent of tickets have been sold. It was followed
by triathlon, swimming, tennis, track cycling and the opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Sailing, synchronised swimming, wrestling, shooting and archery
are the sports struggling most with their ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
SoCOg deputy executive Michael Eyers said at least 90 percent
of all the tickets should be sold by the Games but he would not
speculate on whether SOCOg would meet its 570 million dollars
revenue budget.

SYDNEY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Cathy Freeman finally won the
right to take part in the women's 200 meters as Australian team
decided on Wednesday the berth was Freeman's unless she wanted to
relinquish it.
</P>
<P>
Freeman and Nova Peris-Kneebone have been involved in a fight
over the third and final berth of the women's 200 meters race.
</P>
<P>
Freeman was always the favorite over the less-experienced Peris-
Kneebone. But Australian athletics officials thought Freeman's
competition schedule at the Sydney Olympics was tough enough
without adding the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
Freeman will also take part in the 400 meters and both sprint
relays.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has ordered his government to buy food from local
sources instead of foreign channels in its bid to alleviate food
shortages in most parts of the country, local press reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance will have to spend only about 6.25
million U.S. dollars if the procurement is locally sourced
compared to 21 million dollars when the food is imported from
abroad, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Although Tanzania may witness a crop shortage of about 680,840
tons by the end of this year due to adverse weather, there are
abundant stocks of maize in some parts of the country including
the southwestern Sumbawanga District near the Tanzania-Zambia
border, government officials were quoted as saying.

JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki is to host a luncheon for anti-apartheid struggle

JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A business delegation
led by South African President Thabo Mbeki will head for Algeria
for a Binational Commission meeting at the end of September, South

institutionalize the good relations between the two countries
since official relations were established in May 1994.

NEW DELHI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Delhi police Wednesday
arrested a man who allegedly cheated several foreign missions in
the Indian capital by providing forged supporting documents to
visa seekers, the police announced here.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Starts New Phase of Middle East Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States started a
new phase of mediation between Israelis and Palestinians in New
York Thursday afternoon in a bid to hammer out a peace deal in
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The key meetings are between U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross
and two Palestinian negotiators, Saeb Erekat and Mohammad Dahlan,
and then between Acting Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami
and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright told a news conference at the United Nations that the
talks could move either to Washington or the Middle East and the
United States would bring the two sides together "if it made sense.
"
</P>
<P>
"There is a great deal of very imaginative work going on, a lot
of brainpower," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"Neither side can have 100 percent of what it wants. We cannot
come out this where one side feels that it has won and the other
lost," she said.
</P>
<P>
The United States failed last week to bring about a
breakthrough when President Bill Clinton had separate talks with
the Israeli and Palestinian leaders on the sideline of the United
Nations Millennium Summit held from September 6 to 8.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed With Dow Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed Thursday with the blue chips falling again amid corporate
earnings worries. The tech shares rose for the second straight
session.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
94.71 at 11,087.47 points. The blue chip stock index lost 51.05
points Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 19.97 at 3,913.86 but the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 4.04 at 1,480.87.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell after a Wall Street analyst downgraded the
consumer product maker Colgate-Palmolive because of a drop in the
European currency, the euro, and higher fuel costs. Stocks of the
company fell.
</P>
<P>
An earnings warning from fast-food company McDonald also helped
to drag the blue chips lower. McDonald warned late Wednesday that
euro's fall would cut into its earnings in the third quarter and
several analysts lowered their earnings estimates for the company
after the warning.
</P>
<P>
Investors cashed out of financial service stocks to lock in
profits from a rally before J.P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan Bank
announced Wednesday they were merging. The profit-taking was the
another reason for the Dow's dropping.
</P>
<P>
A government report on lower wholesale prices did not help the
blue chips. The Labor Department reported that wholesale prices
fell an unexpected 0.2 percent in August, the first drop in four
months. The report gave a fresh proof that the U.S. economy is
slowing and inflation remains under control, which would prompt
the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates alone after six hikes
in the past 15 months.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index moved higher as investors continued to rush in
the tech sector for bargain-hunting. Oracle, JDS Uniphase and
Conexant Systems were up.

<HEADLINE> All Road Blockades Removed in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's social situation
returned to normal at midnight Thursday after truckers removed all
blockades they had placed since Sunday in a protest against high
fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, main roads leading to downtown had been cleared
and the whole city showed quiet atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Three truckers' unions which led the protest had accepted a
package of measures proposed by the government to help offset
recent fuel cost rise. They earlier agreed to end the blockades
before midnight.
</P>
<P>
All unions pulled out from motorways, ports, border crossings,
oil depots and gas stations around midnight.
</P>
<P>
Stefan Adriaens, president of the hardline French-speaking
Professional Road Transport Union (UPTR), said his union had to
withdraw because they felt pressure though they did not sign the
agreement with the government.
</P>
<P>
Two other transport unions, primarily representing truckers
from Belgium's Flemish-speaking north, had signed the accord with
government officials on the package -- a mix of road tax cuts and
lower insurance and social charges.
</P>
<P>
Appeared on national television, Belgian Prime Minister Guy
Verhofstadt welcomed the agreement and expressed his satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister earlier raised an ultimatum to force the
truckers to end the blockades and "stop holding the nation to
ransom".
</P>
<P>
"The people's patience is at its end. Our economy, the
prosperity of our people, is in danger," Verhofstadt said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to allow a small minority of truck drivers...
to cause damage to our country, our economy and our people," the
prime minister warned.
</P>
<P>
The unions' decision to lift the blockades came several hours
after the prime minister made the warning and truck drivers in
Britain called off nationwide protests that prompted panic buying
and emptied gas stations.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian protests snarled commuter traffic and forced some
businesses and schools to shut. The country's emergency services
had warned of serious consequences if the blockades continued.
