<HEADLINE> Beijing Opera Focus of China Culture Week in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Opera became the focus of
attention on Wednesday at the `99 Paris China Culture Week here,
when a famous Chinese actress gave a lecture on the 200-year-old
drama which represents one of the best fine arts in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuzheng, the Directress of the Theater of Beijing Opera in
Beijing, gave a simple but clear explanation about the major
esthetic features of Beijing Opera to 500 French listeners at the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organizations
(UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
With a combination of poetry, music, language, dance, painting,
costume, scenery creation and martial art, Beijing Opera is a form
of art which cannot find its exact version in the West, she said.
</P>
<P>
During their performances, the actors and actresses of Beijing
Opera drink, read, recite, sit, fight and dance, and their
characters are represented through different masks featuring
happiness, anger, sadness, amusement and fear, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
She said that compared with Western opera, one of the unique
feature of Beijing Opera is that it does not need many accessories,
because the story and scene are mainly presented through the actions
of actors and actresses.
</P>
<P>
"A table with cups on it and an arm chair are enough to
represent a tea house. A whip in hand is enough to represent a
horse. An oar is enough to represent a boat," she said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that in contrary to the tradition of Western opera
which relies on scenery to present acts, the Beijing Opera relies on
acts to present scenery.
</P>
<P>
"Because of its heavy reliance on acts, Beijing Opera can
overcome the barrier of language, bring about mutual understanding
between actors and audience through actions and gestures, and
become understandable to people from different cultures," she said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Opera is little like Chinese literature and painting,
which also emphasizes subjective feeling and sensation rather than
objective accuracy, which is the case in Western literature and
painting.
</P>
<P>
One retired professor of the Sorbonne University of Paris said
that the Beijing Opera relies more on human efforts than Western
opera.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, he suggested that it no longer bear the
misleading name of "opera," but be called "humane opera" or
simply "Jingxi" in Western languages.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Fines Journalist Already in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian journalist, already
in prison for defaming the agriculture minister, was fined
Wednesday 10,000 pounds (2,950 U.S. dollars) by the Alexandria
Criminal Court for libeling the minister's deputy.
</P>
<P>
Youssef Abdel-Rahman, Agriculture Minister Youssef Wali's
deputy, accused Salah Bdeiwi, a reporter with the opposition
Al-Shaab newspaper, of defaming him in several articles in the
Al-Shaab, the mouthpiece of the Islamist opposition Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
Bdeiwi was sentenced last month along with the paper's
editor-in-chief Magdi Hussein and cartoonist Essam Hanafi to two
years in jail for libeling Wali. Each of the two was also fined
20,000 pounds (5,900 dollars).
</P>
<P>
A fourth journalist of Al-Shaab, Adel Hussein, a columnist and
the editor's brother, was acquitted but fined 20,000 pounds for
defaming Wali to a lower degree.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaab accused Wali of destroying the economy for Israel's
sake and termed him a "traitor."
</P>
<P>
Wali signed several agreements with Israel for the supply of
seeds, fertilizers and technology to arrest desertification.

<HEADLINE> Newly Appointed Head  of Congolese Armed Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The newly appointed head of
the Congolese Armed Forces, Lieutenant-General Sylvestre Luecha,
died last week, Rwanda News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Luecha, 75, is said to have died nine days ago, at Njonja, in
Itombwe, 350 kilometers south of the capital of South Kivu
Province, Bukavu.
</P>
<P>
''We are told that he died nine days ago,'' the Congolese Rally
for Democracy (RCD) Information Minister said, quoting Mai Mai
fighters under Luecha who have surrendered to the rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Luecha might have been shot during
skirmishes which took place in the hills of South Kivu, a breeding
ground for the Mai Mai militia, former Rwandan Hutu extremist
forces, defeated former Rwandan government soldiers (ex-FAR) and
Burundi Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
The RCD rebels challenged President Laurent-Desire Kabila to
show the newly appointed Chief of Armed Forces on television to
prove he was not dead.
</P>
<P>
Luecha and another Mai Mai Commander General Sikatende were
promoted last Friday, much to the dismay of Congolese rebels who
say they should rather be arrested like any members of the
renegade forces who must be netted as stipulated by Lusaka
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had threatened to resume war if Kabila did not
revise his appointments.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger, Haig Urges End of U.S-China Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretaries of
State Henry Kissinger and Alexander M. Haig called on the United
States and China to take measures to end unnecessary
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger, in an article published in the Washington Post
Tuesday, said a sino-American conflict would be avoidable and
damaging to both sides.
</P>
<P>
"The prospects of world peace, stability and progress will be
hazarded if the current unnecessary rush toward confrontation is
not reversed by both sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alexander Haig said like any other two big
countries, there exist differences between the U.S. and China, but
the two countries can work together to establish a stable
relationship as it is in the interest of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Haig, while meeting which Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing here
Tuesday, pointed out that it is wrong for Lee Teng-hui to put
forward the "State-to-State" doctrine, which has created troubles
for all the sides concerned.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan is the core issue between the U.S. and China and
the U.S. government should insist on its "One China" policy and
abide by the three communiques governing U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Henry Kissinger agreed that it is "the
most explosive issue" between the U.S. and China.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger noted that from World War II, American presidents
have affirmed Taiwan to be a part of China in one form or
another and the United States, like the vast majority of the
world's governments, has recognized Beijing as the legitimate
government of all of China.
</P>
<P>
"Were Taiwan to achieve formal American recognition of a
separate status, as its president now seems to seek, this would
surely lead to some kind of military clash that, whatever its
outcome, would permanently rupture Sino-American relations and
isolate America in Asia and probably the world." said Kissinger.
"Taiwan would be less, not more, secure in such an environment."
</P>
<P>
He said with respect to Taiwan, the U.S. government should take
three steps: to leave no ambiguity about America's opposition to
the use of force; to make clear that there is no change in
America's longstanding acceptance of the principle of one China;
to insist on Taiwanese restraint in challenging a framework that,
in fact, ensures their autonomy and without which events may well
run out of control.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger called on the presidents of the two countries to try
to defuse the immediate crisis and begin to place Sino-American
relations on a solid basis in the coming talks in New Zealand.

13 months of President Jamil Mahaud's government.
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Arizaga, 38, has consultancy experience at both

<HEADLINE> FARC Denies Presence in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia (FARC) Wednesday denied any presence in Ecuador and
showed concern over the fact that Quito may have offered the use
of the "Manta" military base to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Sectors in Ecuador" carry out orders from the United States
and agree to become involved in the armed conflict in Colombia,
said a spokesman for the FARC, Captain Raul, in a television
interview with an Ecuadorian television network.
</P>
<P>
The FARC spokesman considered that in a recent tour of South
America, U.S. anti-drugs chief Barry McCaffrey was sounding out
the possibility of help from within the region, for a possible
military attack against the Colombian guerrillas by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"The Ecuadorian government gave the U.S. permission to transfer
the majority of what they had in Panama, this is very serious, not
only for the revolutionary process in Colombia and the FARC, but
also for the population of Ecuador", he added.
</P>
<P>
Captain Raul considered as "very serious", the possibility
that the people of both Ecuador and Colombia will be used as
"cannon fodder for an (eventual) war which is not theirs".
</P>
<P>
The FARC are the largest rebel group in Colombia, followed in
numbers by the National Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
The United States are assembling a military installation in the
Manta base, in the province of Manabi, west of Ecuador, on the
Ecuadorian border with the south of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The rebel spokesman denied the accusation by U.S. officials
that the FARC are involved in the trafficking of drugs.
</P>
<P>
In other extracts from the interview, Captain Raul said that
the FARC are not in league with either Fidel Castro of Cuba, or
Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, although they do have common goals.

SIRTE, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A special OAU summit opened in
Libya's seaport city of Sirte on Wednesday, centering on ways of
restructuring the charter of the pan-African body to enhance unity
among member states.
</P>
<P>
According to Ibrahim Daggash, spokesman of the Organization of
African Unity, 43 African heads of state including Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi were present at the summit.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of Algeria, Tunisia and Sudan were among those who
attend Wednesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, whose country is the
current chair of the OAU, opened the meeting, saying there could be
no Africa unity without peace on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot move forward as long as there are conflicts in Africa
and as long as there are refugees," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, Gadhafi has been trying to lodge more support
from Africa than from the Arab world as he believes African leaders
stood by him during his confrontation with the West over Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
Besides reframing the OAU's charter, the summit, which ends
Thursday, will also discuss Gadhafi's proposal to unite Africa by
promoting economic cooperation and building better transportation
links.

NICOSIA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government
Wednesday decided to offer 1 million U.S dollars in aid to Greece
to help it carry out relief operations following a devastating
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
A Cypriot team comprising engineers and fire-fighters is
heading to Greece, whose capital Athens was hit Tuesday by the
earthquake which was measured at 5.9 degrees on the Richter scale
and has killed at least 50 people and left some 120 people trapped
in fallen buildings.

Cypriot government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou told reporters
after the weekly cabinet meeting that Cyprus' President Glafcos
Clerides Wednesday telephoned Greek Premier Costas Simitis and
informed him of the government decision.
</P>
<P>
He said Clerides conveyed to Simitis Cyprus' readiness to
"offer any assistance which may be required, ranging from
doctors, nurses, engineers, pharmaceuticals, tents or anything
else."
</P>
<P>
Messages of solidarity with the people and the government of
Greece were also sent by Cypriot political parties.

Greece is the strong supporter for the Greek Cypriot-dominated
Cypriot government on the Mediterranean island. Turkish Cypriots

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Kuwaiti official
on Wednesday lashed out at an Iraqi newspaper for its article on
the latest rapprochement efforts between Kuwait and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait "has been used to hostile statements made by Iraqi
media as they sometimes cause confusion," Sulaiman Majid
Al-Shaheen, the Kuwaiti minister of state for foreign affairs, was
quoted as saying by the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi newspaper alleged that Kuwait urged Jordan, which
sided with Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War, to cooperate with it in the
efforts to isolate Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti News Agency did not mention the name of the paper
and the date when the article was published.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaheen said his country has "the right and sovereignty to
deal with any Arab or foreign states freely and sincerely."
</P>
<P>
He also urged those who "cast doubt over the Kuwaiti policy to
refrain from making unjustified statements."
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein wound up a landmark two-day
official visit to Kuwait Monday, closing a decade-long
Jordanian-Kuwaiti estrangement.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaheen is due in Saudi Red Sea port city of Jiddah on
Friday to attend the foreign ministers' meeting of the Gulf Arab
countries aimed at coordinating positions of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states ahead of an Arab League session due in Cairo
next week.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaheen said that the GCC meeting will tackle, among other
issues, the consequences of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, including
the issue of Kuwaiti nationals allegedly still held in captivity
in Iraq.

The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia

ABU DHABI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Omani
Defense Ministry Wednesday denied media reports that Oman is
planning to hold joint navy maneuvers with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"What was carried by the media is totally untrue," the Oman
News Agency quoted the official as saying in Muscat on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a spokesman for Oman's Royal Navy was quoted by
some reports as saying that preparations are under way for the
joint naval exercise that will take place "soon".
</P>
<P>
"The Iran-Oman maneuvers will be useful for ensuring regional
peace and stability," commander of the Iranian navy Admiral Abbas
Mohtaj was also quoted as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Oman agreed last year to carry out military and
logistical cooperation, including joint war games, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The alleged plan of military exercise between Oman and Iran
could upset the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has a dispute
with Iran over Tehran's occupation of the three islands of Abu
Mousa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is against rapprochement with Iran by Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) countries unless the islands dispute is solved. It
is especially opposed to GCC military cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Besides the UAE, the GCC includes Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Qatar and Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> EU-Egyptian Accord to Boost Relations: German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A partnership agreement to be
signed between the European Union (EU) and Egypt will promote the
development of bilateral political and economic cooperation
between the two sides, the German ambassador said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Peter Michael Dingens told a meeting held here on German trade
and investment policies that the agreement "constitutes a strong
basis for" the EU-Egyptian relations and trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Dingens said he is hopeful that the accord will be initialed
ahead of Egypt's September 26 referendum on President Hosni
Mubarak's nomination by the People's Assembly (Parliament) for a
fourth six-year term.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized by the Egyptian Businessmen
Association and aimed at helping Egyptian businessmen get
acquainted with German trade and investment policies, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After almost four years of negotiations, the EU foreign
ministers and an Egyptian ministerial committee in charge of the
agreement endorsed the pact separately in June and July.
</P>
<P>
The accord provides for more open trade, coordination in many
economic and financial areas, a political dialog and joint efforts
to combat money laundering and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Dingens said Egypt is a major partner of EU in the Barcelona
process for the Euro-Med cooperation in view of its political and
strategic weight.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU nations and 12 Mediterranean countries, including
Egypt, kicked off the Barcelona process in a 1995 conference in
Barcelona, Spain. The participants decided to forge close
cooperation in political, economic, social and security fields.
Their key aim is to set up a free trade area by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Germany is interested in opening up European markets to
Egyptian products, the German diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Germany is keen on inviting Egypt to display products at
exhibitions held in the country, Dingens said, adding that the
expo 2000 will be held in the German city of Hanover with Egypt
pitching in with a large pavilion.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Egypt's largest trade partner, accounting for 638
million U.S. dollars of Egypt's exports and 3.6 billion dollars of
its imports in the first half of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Hopes for Positive U.S. Response to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Othman Ismail has expressed hope that the U.S. will
receive positively the Egyptian-Libyan initiative for resolving
the Sudanese crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ismail made the remarks in the Libyan capital of Tripoli after
meeting with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa and Libyan
Assistant Secretary of the General People's Committee on Foreign
Liaison for African Affairs Ali El-Turieki on the sidelines of the
ministerial meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The recent Egyptian-Libyan initiative calls for a permanent
cease-fire and a national peace conference in an effort to end the
16-year-old civil war between the Sudanese government and the
south rebels. The war and the ensuing famine have claimed nearly 2
million lives in the poor African state.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said the initiative is in line with the proposal of the
Inter-Governmental Authority of Development (IGAD) and Khartoum
will adhere to it.
</P>
<P>
The initiative also calls for coordination with the U.S., the
Sudanese News Agency quoted Ismail as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said a preparatory meeting on Sudanese national dialog
will be held in Cairo in October.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent Cairo talks between Moussa and
Sudanese opposition leaders, including Johan Garang, the leader of
the opposition Sudanese People's Liberation Army, Ismail said the
meetings led to some amendments in the timetable for the upcoming
preparatory committee convention.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Moussa voiced Egypt's determination to continue
its efforts to coordinate the position with countries concerned
through the ongoing OAU extraordinary session and the IGAD.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Clinton Discuss Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and his U.S. counterpart, Bill Clinton, agreed Wednesday that
bilateral ties "should not be held hostage to internal political
battles," the Kremlin said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders stated such a position during their telephone
conversation Wednesday, the Interfax news agency quoted the
Kremlin press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
The presidential press service said that "the unleashing of
boisterous campaigns does not contribute to the buildup of mutual
trust."
</P>
<P>
It was apparently referring to Western and Russian media
reports of Russian money laundering through several U.S. banks and
alleged high-level corruption.
</P>
<P>
Russian authorities said domestic politics in the two countries
were behind the media frenzy over the scandals.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told Clinton that a group of Russian law enforcement
agencies' officials is being sent to the U.S. "to work out
interactively with American counterparts issues, related to a
number of publications that have appeared in the U.S. media in
recent time," the press service said.
</P>
<P>
The presidents also discussed a time-table for early bilateral
contacts at various levels, the press service said.
</P>
<P>
It said that special attention was paid to the planned meeting
between Clinton and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin during
the Asian and Pacific Cooperation (APEC) forum in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed arms reduction and bilateral
cooperation in the fight against international terrorism, Interfax
reported.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Dismisses Suit Against British Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Cairo's Appeals Court on
Wednesday threw out a 16.5 billion U.S. dollars suit against a
British newspaper, which had published an article alleging
mistreatment of Christians in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The court approved an earlier ruling by South Cairo Court in
February, which dismissed the case, saying it did not have the
authority to rule it as it should have been filed in London where
the newspaper is produced.
</P>
<P>
The December case filed by an Egyptian lawyer, Mustapha Ashoub,
and 100 Coptic Christians against The Sunday Telegraph stemmed
from its report about a police crackdown on the Christians in the
southern town of al-Kosheh in August, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs demanded 10 billion British pounds (16.5 billion
dollars) from the newspaper as compensation for sullying Egypt's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
Ashoub, meanwhile, said he will resort to the Constitutional
Court, Egypt's highest court, to decide which court is entitled to
look into his case, court officials said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper was also protected by other Egyptian laws that
prohibit courts from hearing cases filed by individuals who have
no direct interest in the outcome. Public interest petitions can
only be filed by the state prosecutor general.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph article was written after police detained
hundreds of Coptic Christians in al-Kosheh during a murder
investigation. Human rights groups said many of the detainees were
beaten and tortured.
</P>
<P>
The allegations, denied by the Egyptian government, caused an
uproar in Egypt after international human rights groups and
Egyptian Copts abroad used it to support allegations that the
government discriminates against the Christian minority.
</P>
<P>
Coptic Christians make up about 10 percent of Egypt's 63
million people.

<HEADLINE> France Wants Full U.N. Role in E. Timor: Chirac </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said on Wednesday that France wants the United Nations Security
Council to take its full responsibility in East Timor, which has
been plunged into a chaos for one week.
</P>
<P>
"I solemnly call on (Indonesian) President (Yusuf) Habibie and
the Indonesian civil and military authorities to respect their
commitment and to guarantee the security of all in East Timor, or
take of risk of having the international financial aid to
Indonesia put into doubt," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has rejected that U.N. deploy a
peacekeeping force in East Timor, after pro-Indonesian militiamen
have put the territory under an absolute rule of terror in
collaboration with the Indonesian army and police.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the people of East Timor have freely expressed
their choice during the U.N.-sponsored referendum on the future of
the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
"The choice which was made through the votes should be
respected. The security and the freedom of everyone should be
guaranteed. Violence and murders should stop," he said during a
meeting of the government ministers.
</P>
<P>
Chirac described the current situation in East Timor as
"intolerable acts of massive and murderous persecutions."
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party has called on the government to stop all
military cooperation with and suspend financial aid to Indonesia
until peace and security are reestablished in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party will organize a rally in Paris Wednesday
evening to express support and sympathy to the people of East
Timor.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Ready to Assist Keeping Order in E. Timor: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Wednesday the United Nations is planning to go
ahead with international intervention in East Timor as the
situation there is deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
He said he told Indonesian President B.J. Habibie that "if they
(Indonesians) are unable to maintain law and order, then they
would have to accept international assistance... and this is
something the (Security) Council will press."
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks during a Security Council session on
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
A five-member team sent Monday by the Security Council is now
in Jakarta and it has had several meetings, while President
Habibie is going to see the team Wednesday afternoon, the U.N.
chief told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said only time will tell if the new troops sent by the
Indonesian Government to replace those in East Timor will improve
the security situation there.
</P>
<P>
"I think that there is too much killing, we cannot stand by and
allow the people of East Timor to be killed," Annan said,
expressing U.N.'s determination to fully implement the results of
the August 30 ballot in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Violent activities by anti-independence militias following the
ballot have resulted in life losses, people's displacement and
threat to the security to the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET)
which organized the ballot.
</P>
<P>
The referendum is in favor of East Timor's independence
instead of special autonomy within Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Mitchell Says Deadlock on N.Ireland Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator George Mitchell
said on Wednesday that he still thought the problems plaguing the
Northern Ireland peace process could be solved.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. senator made the remarks in the Northern
Ireland capital Belfast after three days of listening to British
and Irish officials and rival parties at odds over whether Sinn
Fein should enter government before its Irish Republican Army
(IRA) allies disarmed.
</P>
<P>
"I am encouraged by the seriousness of purpose and
determination with which they are entering this review," he said
in a statement released after he left for the United States.
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged "deep differences" among all groups over
how the Good Friday agreement could be implemented.
</P>
<P>
He is due back in Belfast next Monday to resume the talks.
</P>
<P>
The biggest barrier to implementing the landmark Good Friday
Agreement signed in April, 1998, is that Ulster Unionists in the
most powerful Protestant party refuse to set up a power-sharing
executive with Sinn Fein until the IRA hands in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell had guided two years of tortuous talks leading up to
last year's accord.
</P>
<P>
He remained optimistic at mid-week despite expressions of
pessimism from Protestant politicians, including Ulster Unionist
leader and provincial First Minister David Trimble.

<HEADLINE> First Briton Charged Under New "Air Rage" Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A 36-year-old man has become
the first person to be charged under Britain's tough new "air
rage" laws which came into effect last week, the Reuters reported
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation is aimed at passengers who threaten, insult
or abuse airline crew members or interfere with their duties. The
maximum penalty is two years' imprisonment or an unlimited fine.
</P>
<P>
Tony Chandler, aged 36, was charged with being drunk on an
aircraft, acting in a disruptive manner.
</P>
<P>
"He's the first person to be charged with the new offense and
he will appear in court on October 13," spokeswoman for Manchester
police said.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place on Tuesday's 9:45 a.m.(0745 GMT) KLM
flight from Amsterdam to Manchester.
</P>
<P>
Following take-off, one of the passengers became verbally
abusive after he was refused more alcohol -- the cabin crew
surmised that he was intoxicated, the captain called ahead to make
sure the police were there to arrest him on landing, said a KLM
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The government introduced the new legislation in an attempt to
curb an alarming increase in air rage attacks which British
Airways claims have increased by 400 percent in the past four
years.

<HEADLINE> WTO Urged to Take Environment Issues Into Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF) has called on members of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
to modify rules to take account of environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
"Unless a number of changes are made, the world will not have
the rules-based multilateral trading system needed for a
sustainable global economy," said Charles Arden-Clarke, head of
WWF's Trade and Investment Unit, at a press briefing here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The conservation organization warned that it is vital to ensure
that WTO rules and decisions do not undermine the multilateral
environmental agreements and national policies designed to protect
the environment.
</P>
<P>
The WWF asked WTO members to ensure that negotiations at the
ministerial conference on trade in Seattle, the United States,
later this year to allow the use of non-protectionist trade
measures to achieve environmental objectives outlined in the
multilateral environmental agreements.
</P>
<P>
"Only a balanced negotiating agenda, combined with an effective
re-linking of trade policy-making to parliaments and the needs of
people and the environment, can rescue the next round of WTO
negotiations from widespread public criticism, and stem the
continuing erosion of public and parliamentary confidence in the
WTO," said the WWF.

BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- No commercial banks in
Thailand would be affected by the so-called "Nines Problem"
supposed to occur Thursday, the Thai News Agency (TNA) Wednesday
quoted a senior official from the Bank of Thailand as saying.
</P>
<P>
There have been fears that the date-related computer glitch or
millennium bug may strike for the first time Thursday when the
calendar turns to the four nines -- September 9, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kitti Pattanapongpibul, deputy governor of the Bank of Thailand
(BOT), was quoted as saying that the Nines Problem would not
affect commercial banks because the banks' systems had been fixed
and were ready to cope with all date-related problems.
</P>
<P>
He also said the banks were now ready for services when the
clock strikes midnight on December 31.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Thai Airways International said the country's
airliner plans to maintain normal flights on Thursday and to fly
over the millennium period.
</P>
<P>
The airliner has done testing with the technical glitches
already, which have found no risk of the millennium bug to the
navigation system, an official from the airways' information
technology service said.
</P>
<P>
The THAI captains are to fly 119 international routes and 107
domestic flights on Thursday. They have no plan to suspend flights
over the millennium period either, the TNA said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Slams U.N. Decision to Use Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Wednesday
lodged "the strongest protest" with the U.N. Security Council
against a regulation by the U.N. special representative for Kosovo
to permit the use of foreign currencies as legal tender in Kosovo,
the Serbian province, and demanded the Security Council
immediately cancel the decision.
</P>
<P>
The protest was contained in a letter to the president of the
Security Council from Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of
the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations. The letter was
officially published here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic, in the letter, said, "The regulation constitutes a
most flagrant violation of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)
and an attack on the sovereignty, monetary and financial unity and
the economic, legal and, by extension, territorial integrity of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
"Alongside the abolition of the Yugoslav monetary and financial
laws and control, the permission is a crass excess of the mandate
by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and amounts
to the constitution of aggression by other means, aimed at
separating Kosovo from the constitutional and legal whole of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These illegal and arbitrary acts of the Special Representative
of the Secretary-General are outside the bounds of relevant
behavior and seriously threaten the process of finding a solution
to Kosovo on the basis of Security Council resolution 1244," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted on June 10, demands all Member States
respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia calls on the
Security Council to condemn the regulation most energetically and
to cancel it immediately," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the United Nations has legalized the use of
foreign currencies for payments and contracts in the Serbian
province in what the United Nations called "another major step to
restart economy of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
The new legislative act, signed Thursday by the U.N. special
representative for Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, allows the use of all
currencies, including the Yugoslav dinar, while lifting past legal
restrictions on the use of all foreign currencies, the U.N.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important first step towards the creation of
functioning banking, payments and fiscal systems in Kosovo," said
Joly Dixon, the U.N. deputy special representative in charge of
economic reconstruction in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> BoE Raises Interest Rates To 5.25 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England (BoE)
Wednesday surprised financial markets by raising Britain's 'base
rate' by a quarter point to 5.25 percent, the first rise since
June last year.
</P>
<P>
The BoE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cited world demand,
the strength of consumption, the booming housing market and
continuing tight conditions in the labor market as reasons for the
rate move.
</P>
<P>
The UK banks moved quickly to raise their mortgage and base
interest rates immediately after the BoE increased its key short
term rate.
</P>
<P>
Bank shares fell 2.15 percent in early afternoon trade on fears
that rising interest rates may slow loan growth and hurt credit
quality, helping drag the FTSE 100 down 1.3 percent by 1345 GMT.
</P>
<P>
Halifax Plc, Britain's largest mortgage bank, was the first to
jump, lifting its key variable mortgage rate by 14 basis points to
6.99 percent.
</P>
<P>
The BoE had last changed its 'base rate' in June, when it cut
the rate by a quarter point to of 5 percent, which was a 22-year
low.

<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) - Speakers at a high-level
symposium held here today called for stronger international
investment and trade cooperation with China in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In her keynote speech, Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi said that
China will continue to adhere to its basic state policy of opening
up and improving its investment environment to bring in foreign
financers.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Chinese government understands that many
changes have taken place in both domestic and international
spheres, adding that China will tap its potential and open wider
to the outside in order to benefit Chinese and foreign partners in
international investment projects.
</P>
<P>
Dignitaries from China, Britain, Saudi Arabia and
international organizations and multinational corporations also
spoke at the meeting, themed "International Investment Cooperation
in the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
Sun Guangxiang, vice-minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation, said that in the process of economic
globalization, multinational corporations are becoming a major
driving force behind trade.
</P>
<P>
While the Chinese government is engaged in cooperation with
small and medium-sized enterprises from other countries, it is
also expecting to cooperate with multinational corporations,
encourage investment from them, and make full use of international
capital and advanced management and operation expertise, as well
as the latest scientific and technological research results from
the corporations, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a lack of funding is one of the major factors
hindering the economic growth of developing countries like China.
In order to ensure a steady, fast and sound growth of the national
economy, China must actively absorb overseas investment while
making good use of domestic capital.
</P>
<P>
Osama J. Faquih, minister of Commerce of Saudi Arabia, said
that the volume of trade between Saudi Arabia and China has
progressively grown over the past five years, from 770 million U.S.
dollars in 1992 to about 1.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1998. That
level is still modest when compared to the enormous capacity and
potential of both countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries need to urge their business communities and
institutions to bring their trade exchanges and investment, both
in volume and content, to a level equal to their capabilities, he
said.

Richard Caborn, minister of trade of the United Kingdom, said
China's opening-up process is one of the great global economic
success stories of the second half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has rightly earned the admiration of the
rest of the world for the way it has managed rapid change without
major social disruption, noting that China is now a global
economic player, with a key role in ensuring the long-term
strength and stability of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"Most of investors tell us that they are generally happy with
their business achievements in China, whether through joint
ventures or enterprises owned wholly by foreigners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies derive enormous encouragement from the
commitment by the Chinese government to their presence in China,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Folke Ahlback, one of senior vice presidents of Nokia Company,
said, "We in Nokia are very satisfied with the results of our
Chinese partnerships. We have reached a really good cooperation
spirit in many areas."
</P>
<P>
Nokia considers the investments and re-investments in China as
highly justified and is confident about the future good
development of Nokia-China activities, which are increasingly seen
as an integral part of Nokia's growth, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Indonesia to Restore Order in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday urged Indonesia to restore peace and order in East Timor
or to invite an international peacekeeping force to do that.
</P>
<P>
"The point we have made very clearly and forcefully to the
Indonesian government is that they need to demonstrate that they
are prepared to assert control in East Timor or we believe they
should invite an international presence to restore order," White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been no indication that unrest had eased in
East Timor and Washington was "pressing the (Indonesian)
government at all levels and through all channels that they do
face a choice here."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States was considering what level of
assistance would be needed if the international peacekeeping
force was formed.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart also said that U.S. and international economic aid
to Indonesia depended on whether it could quell unrest and
restore order in East Timor.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unlikely to Send Troops to East Timor: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States is not
planning to send peacekeeping troops to turmoil-ridden East Timor,
but is discussing support for any such international force with
other nations, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be selective where we commit our forces and,
under the circumstances, this is not an area that we are
prepared to commit forces," Cohen told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is not planning on any insertion of
peacekeeping forces. We are coordinating and talking to the
Australians and others who would be interested in a peacekeeping
force should the Indonesian government invite such a force in
and should the United Nations approve it," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was up to the government of Indonesia to bring
peace to East Timor or to invite an international peacekeeping
force in under the auspices of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that there would be major economic and other
financial consequences for Indonesia if it failed to bring peace
to East Timor.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Tropical Storm Floyd formed
in the Atlantic Ocean hundreds of kilometers east of the Caribbean
Wednesday with ominous potential, hurricane forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, the center of Floyd was located about
1,280 kilometers (800 miles) east of the Leeward Islands at
latitude 15.6 north, longitude 49.1 west, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Floyd was expected to strengthen while continuing at the same
speed through early Thursday, moving well northeast of Puerto Rico
and the Leeward Islands in the northeastern Caribbean islands.
</P>
<P>
It was expected to be a hurricane by late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Floyd was the sixth tropical storm of the 1999 Atlantic
hurricane season. Circular tropical weather systems are given
names when maximum winds reach 63 kph (39 mph) and become
hurricanes when top winds hit 119 kph (74 mph).

<HEADLINE> Indonesian FM Meets U.N. Security Council Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas Wednesday met a five-member United Nations Security
Council mission here and exchanged views on the latest
developments in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"We had a good discussion. They submitted their views and
conveyed a message from the U.N. secretary general and Security
Council members. On the other hand, I filled them in on the latest
developments, especially on the reasons for the declaration of a
military emergency in East Timor," Alatas told reporters after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government declared a state of emergency in East
Timor Tuesday morning following serious violence in the territory.
</P>
<P>
The military emergency status was imposed on East Timor on the
basis of careful considerations, Alatas said, adding that the
question of sending a U.N. peacekeeping force to East Timor did
not arise.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said during the second phase of the East Timor
settlement process the Indonesian government continued to be
responsible for what was happening in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
According to an accord reached by Indonesia, Portugal and U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York on May 5, the second
phase of the settlement process means the period between the
announcement of a ballot result favoring independence and the
endorsement of such a ballot outcome by the Indonesian People's
Consultative Assembly which is to meet starting October.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Martin Andjaba of Namibia, leader of the U.N.
Security Council's mission, said his group and Alatas exchanged
views on how to end the bloodshed in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"We have been assured that the Indonesian government is
committed. I would not go into any details now because our
discussion is continuing," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council team consisted of U.N. envoys from
Britain, Slovenia, Malaysia, Namibia and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The mission, which was organized after an emergency Security
Council meeting on September 6, arrived in Jakarta on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The mission was scheduled also to meet with President B.J.
Habibie and Chief of National Defense Forces Gen. Wiranto on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The violence in East Timor flared up following the announcement
in New York on September 4 that 78.5 percent of voters in the
U.N.-organized August 30 direct ballot had opted for independence
from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in
1976, has been seen by the U.N. General Assembly as a
non-self-governing territory.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide PC Unit Volume Expected to Grow 24 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Unit volume in the
worldwide PC market in the third quarter is expected to grow 24.8
percent from a year ago, said market researcher International Data
Corp.(IDC) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Market expansion will continue to be led by robust global
consumer demand for ever-cheaper PCs, healthy growth in Asian
markets and the strong U.S. economy, the market research company
said.
</P>
<P>
Unit shipments are expected to rise 7.2 percent in the third
quarter from 10.9 million PCs in the second quarter. In the second
quarter last year, PC makers deliver eight million computers.
</P>
<P>
Japan has the highest year-to-year growth rate in the second
quarter with an increase of 39 percent, according to IDC, which is
forecasting a 32 percent increase in PC shipments in the country
during the current quarter. Western Europe's PC demand is expected
to grow 16.3 percent in the third quarter, while U.S. PC volumes
will be up 12.2 percent to 12.2 million units in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
PC shipments in the Asia-Pacific market, excluding Japan, will
be up 34.43 percent in the third quarter compared with last year,
IDC said. China, India, South Korea and Australia are expected to
drive the growth in the region. But political unrest in India,
Indonesia and Malaysia could hamper the region's growth in the
second half of this year, said the research firm.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Dismisses Suit Against British Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Cairo's Appeals Court on
Wednesday threw out a 16.5 billion U.S. dollars suit against a
British newspaper, which had published an article alleging
mistreatment of Christians in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The court approved an earlier ruling by South Cairo Court in
February, which dismissed the case, saying it did not have the
authority to rule it as it should have been filed in London where
the newspaper is produced.
</P>
<P>
The December case filed by an Egyptian lawyer, Mustapha Ashoub,
and 100 Coptic Christians against The Sunday Telegraph stemmed
from its report about a police crackdown on the Christians in the
southern town of al-Kosheh in August, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs demanded 10 billion British pounds (16.5 billion
dollars) from the newspaper as compensation for sullying Egypt's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
Ashoub, meanwhile, said he will resort to the Constitutional
Court, Egypt's highest court, to decide which court is entitled to
look into his case, court officials said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper was also protected by other Egyptian laws that
prohibit courts from hearing cases filed by individuals who have
no direct interest in the outcome. Public interest petitions can
only be filed by the state prosecutor general.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph article was written after police detained
hundreds of Coptic Christians in al-Kosheh during a murder
investigation. Human rights groups said many of the detainees were
beaten and tortured.
</P>
<P>
The allegations, denied by the Egyptian government, caused an
uproar in Egypt after international human rights groups and
Egyptian Copts abroad used it to support allegations that the
government discriminates against the Christian minority.
</P>
<P>
Coptic Christians make up about 10 percent of Egypt's 63
million people.

<HEADLINE> Israel Releases Palestinian Prisoners Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel decided Wednesday to
release 200 Palestinian prisoners Thursday morning, the first
step in the implementation of a peace accord signed by Israel and
the Palestinians last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli committee headed by the director-general of the
Justice Ministry formally approved the list of the first batch
of Palestinian prisoners to be released, a government statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The 200 prisoners will be brought from various prisons in
Israel to military checkpoints outside Palestinian self-rule towns
 in the West Bank Thursday morning, according to Israeli radio
reports.
</P>
<P>
The release of the 200 prisoners is in the first stage of the
modified Wye land-for-security deal signed by Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yesser Arafat in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is originally due to take effect in a week after
its signing.
</P>
<P>
Israel's parliament overwhelmingly approved the agreement
Wednesday night, paving the way for three stages of Israeli
redeployments in 11 percent of the West Bank. The cabinet
ratified the accord by a large margin Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 120-member Knesset voted 52 in favor, 23 against, with 2
abstention, to approve the agreement. The other Knesset members
did not take part in the voting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the cabinet voted 17-1, with one
abstention, to give go-ahead to the implementation of the
agreement's first stage, in which Israel will also transfer 7
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians besides the
release of prisoners. Four ministers were absent from the
voting.
</P>
<P>
Barak said the decision to hand over parts of the biblical
Land of Israel was not easy, but that it is in Israel's best
interest to move toward comprehensive peace agreements with its
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Israeli negotiator Gilad Sher has said that the first
redeployment will be carried out on September 13, the 6th
anniversary of the signing of the historic Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
The release of Palestinian prisoners had been a thorny
issue in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Israel has insisted
that it would not release those Palestinians who killed Israelis
or belong to Islamic militant group Hamas or Jihad.
</P>
<P>
Among the 200 prisoners to be release Thursday, 150 were
jailed for killing Palestinians who had cooperated with Israeli
security services, 15 were involved in the wounding of Israelis,
Israel Radio said. The others were jailed for other security
offensives, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
A further 150 prisoners are due to be freed on October
8.

<HEADLINE> Western European Union Intends to Cooperate With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Western European Union
(WEU), a growing defense organ of the European Union (EU), wishes
to carry out cooperation with China in safeguarding international
peace security, said a senior WEU official Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with Xinhua on the eve of her visit to
China, Lluis Maria de Puig, president of the Assembly of the WEU,
said that both the WEU and China want to see an improvement of the
security in their proper regions.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the National People's Congress of China,
de Puig will start an official visit to China on September 9 and
will become the first WEU leader to visit China since 1985.
</P>
<P>
De Puig said that since the situation in one region of the
world can influence the security of others, it is extremely
important for different countries and international organizations
to meet and discuss the latest development of the world situation,
and the prevention and handling of crises.
</P>
<P>
The WEU leader pointed out that after the EU leaders decided to
reinforce their security and defense policy by integrating the WEU
into the EU during the Cologne Summit in June, the WEU's task has
become heavier and it needs a comprehensive picture of world
security.
</P>
<P>
"The WEU considers China as one of the most important actors on
the world stage because of its dimension, its human and natural
resources, its permanent membership at the United Nations Security
Council and the rapidness of its development," she said.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the Paris-based organization will seek to
increase dialogue and cooperation with China, she said.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1955, the WEU now has 10 formal members, five
observatory countries and three associated countries in Western
Europe. It also has established relations of partnership with 10
Eastern and Central European countries.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Questioned in Labor Secretary Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S President Bill Clinton
was questioned by an independent counsel Wednesday in the federal
investigation over allegations of influence-peddling and campaign
finance improprieties against Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.
</P>
<P>
The interview was conducted by Independent Counsel Ralph
Lancaster and two associates, John Kotelly and David Barry.
</P>
<P>
"The Interview lasted one hour and was conducted under oath.
Consistent with prior practice, no further statement about the
interview will be made," the White House said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, who was named to the post of independent counsel in
May 1998, is investigating allegations Herman solicited illegal
campaign contributions of 250,000 dollars and engaged in influence
peddling while she was a White House aide during President
Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
Herman has denied the allegations and Clinton has said he is
confident that investigators will conclude that Herman did nothing
wrong.
</P>
<P>
The charges focus on claims by Cameroon-born businessman
Laurent Yene that he delivered an envelope of cash to Herman's
home, representing a 10 percent cut of consulting fees he earned
from a client seeking a federal license for a satellite telephone
system.
</P>
<P>
Yene also claimed that Herman directed Vanessa Weaver, a close
friend of Herman, to obtain campaign contributions for the
Democratic National Committee from a firm.
</P>
<P>
Lancaster's investigation is one of five independent-counsel
probes of government officials that remain at least technically
open following the expiration of the independent-counsel law in
June.

<HEADLINE> IMF Warns About Risks to World Financial Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund warned Wednesday that world financial markets are still
facing some potential risks such as a sharp drop in high-flying
U.S. stock prices or the value of the U.S. dollar, even though
there is a pickup in the global economy since last autumn.
</P>
<P>
In its annual assessment of the state of international capital
markets, the IMF found a number of encouraging signs that the
world is beginning to recover after nearly two years of turmoil
caused by plunging currency values and deep recessions in many
Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said that so far this year, there have been a number of
favorable signs that the risks of a worldwide recession have
lessened significantly. These include "surprisingly robust" growth
in the United States and signs that Japan, which has been
struggling with its worst recession in 50 years, is beginning "to
take important measures to stabilize its economy and address its
banking sector problems," it said.
</P>
<P>
But the IMF warned, "Notwithstanding these favorable
developments, conditions in financial markets remain fragile, as
evidenced by continued high levels of volatility... and capital
flows to the emerging markets that are running well below the
rates during the boom years."
</P>
<P>
Among the current risks, the IMF listed the possibility that
the high-flying U.S. stock market could suddenly plunge if
corporate earnings falter, and the threat that the U.S. dollar
could drop sharply in value if foreigners become worried about
record monthly trade deficits.
</P>
<P>
"The remarkably high level of valuations in the U.S. equity
market, reached after a nearly unprecedented period of gains,
poses a risk in global financial markets," the IMF report said.
"Although a correction in the U.S. market might have domestic
origins, it could well have international consequences."
</P>
<P>
IMF officials stressed that they are not predicting a stock
market crash or a sudden drop in the dollar's value but only
noting that these are two of the major risks to the United States
and the global economy going forward.
</P>
<P>
Another potential threat could come as financial markets deal
with the year 2000 problem in which there are fears that computers
could malfunction because of an inability to read dates.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said that currently many market interest rates have
already been driven up by as much as a half-percentage point
because of increased borrowing by corporations and some foreign
governments to have enough cash on hand to deal with any possible
disruptions.
</P>
<P>
The IMF report and a companion document of economic forecasts
will serve as starting points for discussions when finance
ministers and central bank presidents from around the world gather
in Washington in two weeks for the annual meetings of the
182-nation IMF and its sister lending agency, the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary economic forecasts, released by the Dutch
Finance Ministry Monday, showed the IMF believes the world economy
will expand 2.8 percent this year and 3.4 percent in the year
2000, representing an upward revision from IMF projections made in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
IMF officials said that the figures released are preliminary
and subject to change before their formal release later this
month.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Senator Bill
Bradley Wednesday formally launched his campaign for the
Democratic presidential nominations in his hometown of Crystal
City, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
"I feel an urgent need to seize this moment in history, to
strengthen the weak and to challenge the strong to lead us into
our full greatness as a nation," said the former New Jersey
senator in a speech. He is the only Democratic rival of Vice
President Al Gore in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
"I'm more interested in leadership than polls and politics,''
he said. "I believe we need a new kind of leadership."
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who promised a "different kind of campaign", stressed
a need for racial harmony, better health care and a stronger
education system.
</P>
<P>
Bradley trails Gore not only in the polls but also in fund
raising and party endorsement.
</P>
<P>
Bradley, 56, was an all-American basketball star at Princeton
University, a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University and senator
from New Jersey for 18 years before he became the only
Democrat to challenge Gore for the nomination.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Pledges Telecom Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government has
reaffirmed its commitment to liberalizing the telecommunications
sector and immediately opening its cellular phone market to
operators.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Fernandes, deputy minister of Transport and
Communications, made the pledge monday while explaining the
government strategy to the Parliamentary Commission on Economic
Activities and Services, a report carried by Wednesday's issue of
the independent newsheet " Metical" said.
</P>
<P>
Currently the company M-Cel, which is a joint venture between
TDM, Mozambique' s publicly owned telecommunications company, and
Detecom, Germany's company, has monopolized the cellular phone
network in southern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to open this market immediately to other
operators, Fernandes said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister explained that the main reason for
abandoning the state monopoly over the fixed phone network is that
the state simply does not have the money needed to make the
necessary new investments in telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The external sources of funding, on which TDM had relied in the
past, are drying up, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The solution we think correct is to open up to other
operators, and do away with the state monopoly", he stressed.

<HEADLINE> IMF Loan for Angola Needs "Patience" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A delegate from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) said here Wednesday that Angola
should be more patient with the possible IMF loan despite the
positive contact with the country.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Neuhaus, head of an IMF mission to Angola, made the
statement before leaving here for Washington, where he will remit
the results of the negotiations aimed at starting an economic
program monitored by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Neuhaus said that during the visit, his delegation made
appraisals on the impact of the measures taken by the Angolan
government in the ambit of structure readjustment, with an aim to
reanimate the Angolan economy.
</P>
<P>
Those measures in financial and monetary systems and exchange
control are "opportune", he said, but pointing out that the
country should be more patient, because the results of the
measures are, after all, not of " immediate character".
</P>
<P>
Neuhaus said it is a "very positive" sign that the Angolan
government has made strong engagement in discussion with the IMF
on all questions, which could rapidly lead to the start of the
monitored program.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the right way for the initiation of the monitored
program by the fund, from January of 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
The monitored program will permit IMF to participate in shaping
Angola's economic policy and make evaluation on some goals of the
government's program for 1999/2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the program established by IMF, the Angolan government
should adopt such policies as lowering the inflation rate,
reforming the tax system and cutting the administrative
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
A full implementation of the monitored program will make Angola
 accessible to another program called Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF), which has been established by the IMF
to provide long- term and low-interest (0.5%) loans to the
countries in low water, encouraging them to reform their economic
structure.
</P>
<P>
During the seven-day visit to Angola, the IMF mission held
talks with the Angolan government on questions relating to
financial policy, monetary system, exchange control, external
debts, inflation, petroleum price and budget transparency.
</P>
<P>
Future negotiations will take place in Washington following the
annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank to be held late this
month.

<P>
ROME, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Italy condemned the violence in
East Timor Wednesday and stressed that it was willing to back
United Nations intervention in the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
The Italian premier office's statement said, "Italy firmly asks
Indonesia to behave responsibly, respecting its U.N. commitments
and agreeing to collaborate with the efforts and initiatives of
the international community, as represented by the U.N., in order
to re-establish conditions of peace and security."
</P>
<P>
Italy also pressed Indonesia to "fully accept" the results of
the recent independence referendum, to "act decisively to stop the
massacres," and to "guarantee respect for fundamental rights," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Italy backs U.N. action aimed at stopping the violence and
disorder, also supporting the U.N. through the European Union,
whose foreign ministers will discuss the crisis on September 13 in
Brussels," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor has been teetering on the brink of civil war since
Saturday, when the United Nations announced that 78.5 percent of
East Timorese had voted in favor of independence from Indonesia in
a recent referendum, as opposed to autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Armed militia groups have been killing civilians and forcing
tens of thousands to evacuate the island.

<HEADLINE> Romania's GDP Down by 3.9 Percent in First Semester </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product
(GDP) of Romania registered in the first semester of 1999 was
180.403 trillion lei, 3.9 percent lower than that in the same
period of last year, showed the latest statistics released by the
government.
</P>
<P>
The drop greatly surpassed the anticipated target of 2 percent
set by the government for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
In all branches of the economy, except for agriculture,
forestry, fishing and forest exploitation, operations performed
during the first semester of 1999 were under the level registered
last year. The most pronounced decrease was in constructions (-14
percent), followed by industry (-5.9 percent) and services (-2.3
percent).
</P>
<P>
Gross added value registered in agriculture, forestry, fishing
and forest exploitation had an increase of 0.8 percent compared to
the first semester of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Imports of goods and services in the first semester 1999 of was
almost at the same level with that of the previous year (-0.6
percent), but exports of goods and services were 7.6 percent
higher.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Central Bank Submits 1998 Business Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of Romania
submitted early this week its business report for 1998 to the
Parliament, drawing attention to the fact that the real economy
retreated for the second consecutive year, with the only success
in the significant decrease of the inflation rate against 1997.
</P>
<P>
The decline of industry and constructions, as well as of
agricultural production below the achievements of the previous
year, and higher unemployment were reflected in lower GDP. The
domestic debt of the state rose, and the unfavorable status of
foreign trade aggravated the decline, the local Nine O'clock daily
informed on Wednesday citing the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bank stresses that arrears to the state and social
insurance budgets were further tolerated in 1998, while certain
loss-making companies benefited from rescheduling of debts to the
state, energy suppliers and banks.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the salary policy was permissive and in contradiction
with economic reality, aggravating the serious imbalances of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Last year, GDP fell 7.3 percent against 1997's 338,670
billion lei(about 30 billion U.S. dollars). The sector of the
economy with the major participation in GDP formation was that of
services. This trend reflects structural changes in the economy,
the bank estimated in these conditions, industry lost supremacy in
creating GDP. In industry, statistics point to a fall of
production and of the contribution to the formation of state
revenues, for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
The central bank pointed out that restructuring and
privatization were the vulnerable points of the reform program in
1998 too. Nevertheless, these processes were firmly relaunched by
the end of the year. Restructuring loss- making industrial
companies and non-profitable state farms did not yield enough
results in order to have a good impact on the general status of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Decreasing the annual rate of inflation, from 151 in 1997 down
to 59.1 percent, was the outcome of a consistently restrictive
attitude.
</P>
<P>
1999 can be considered a decisive year for Romania's
transition, the report specified. The central bank announced that
GDP might fall around 3-3.5 percent, while the unemployment rate
could exceed 12 percent. If the authorities act in a firm way, the
unfavorable trend could be interrupted in the second half of the
year.

<HEADLINE> Greece Announces Measures to Help Earthquake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Wednesday announced measures to provide support and
restitution to those left homeless by Tuesday's powerful
earthquake which hit northern Athens.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Simitis said that each family
left homeless by the earthquake would receive an immediate lump
sum payment of 200,000 drachmas (about 662.3 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Local government authorities would be charged with setting up
camping sites for the establishment of tent cities for the
temporarily homeless, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the state would undertake to cover one
third of the cost of the rebuilding or repair of damaged homes and
would also provide interest-free 15-year loans.
</P>
<P>
Also available would be subsidized loans for those
self-employed professionals and commercial enterprises hurt by the
quake.
</P>
<P>
So far, the death toll from Tuesday's earthquake measuring 5.9
on the Richter scale has risen to 63, and 2,006 persons were
injuried and 10,000 left homeless.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 tents and makeshift shelters had been delivered
while 1,500 firemen and 2,000 soldiers were involved in rescue
work, along with army engineers.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A British warship was preparing
Wednesday to head for the waters around East Timor to support any
United Nations peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
The ship was dispatched to the island by British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, who was worried by East Timor's "descent into chaos."
</P>
<P>
Britain would also send a team of military advisers to help
plan for the peacekeeping force, a spokesman for Blair told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The destroyer HMS Glasgow, a Type 42 guided missile destroyer
with around 280 men on board, is currently in Malaysian waters.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the warship would sail within hours for East
Timor where it was expected to join Australian vessels to provide
support "as the United Nations sees fit."
</P>
<P>
"It will have a communications facility and command and control
support as well," he said, adding that the ship would take some
days to reach East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of East Timorese have been killed since the province
voted overwhelmingly last week to end 23 years of Indonesian rule.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Indonesia has ruled out any early deployment of
foreign peacekeepers, but Blair's spokesman said Britain would
push hard to win acceptance for their deployment.

BRAZILIA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A mission from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) will arrive in Brazil Thursday
to interview chiefs of finance and budget, and will perform
the fourth evaluation of the agreement signed with the country.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry Wednesday said that Finance Minister Pedro
Malan will meet with representatives from the international
organization Friday and it will be the turn of Budget Minister

bailing Latin America's biggest economy out of the devastating
effects of its 30-percent plus currency devaluation in January.

<HEADLINE> HK Banking Business Stood Usual on Y2K Critical Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) Thursday said that banks in Hong Kong have
reported normal operations throughout the morning.
</P>
<P>
No reports have been received so far from banks of any computer
problems arising from the transition to September 9, 1999, which
is widely regarded as one of the critical dates in connection with
the Year 2000 issue, a senior HKMA official said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the supervisory initiatives taken by the
HKMA, banks are required periodically to report to the HKMA
extensive information on their operations and on any material
exceptions they may encounter during the Year 2000 critical
periods, including September 9, 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
To provide for efficient monitoring of banks' functions during
the current critical period, the HKMA's Year 2000 Event Management
Center has been in operation since 6:00 p.m. September 8 and will
continue its monitoring exercise round the clock until the reports
from banks have been completed and assessed, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The absence so far of any reports from banks of Year-2000-
related problems seems to be confirming our expectations that
September 9 would not produce problems for Hong Kong's banking
sector," said David Carse, deputy chief executive of the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
"The HKMA looks forward to a successful completion of the
current monitoring exercise and to continuing its work with the
banks and the general public to strive to ensure that the
millennium date change passes smoothly and without incident,"
Carse added.
</P>
<P>
No Y2K incidents was reported in Hong Kong, said the Central
Coordinating Center (CCC) for monitoring the computer bug problem
during the rollover to September 9, early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government
and various essential service sectors went on full alert during
the rollover, said Jessie Ting, deputy secretary for information
technology and broadcasting who is also the controller of the CCC.
</P>
<P>
"Both the government and the essential services providers have
made tremendous efforts to solve the Y2K problem. We have also
drawn up contingency arrangements to ensure a prompt response to
any unforeseen Y2K-induced incidents," she said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Following are the highlights
of the diplomatic news released by Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
Greek PM Postpones Visit to China
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Constantine Simitis has decided to
postpone his official visit to China originally scheduled between
September 15 and 21, due to the earthquake at home.
</P>
<P>
This was released by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun
Yuxi here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
 Chinese Vice-Premier Meets OECD Secretary-General
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met with Donald Johnson,
secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), here today.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed the guest on China's economic situation and the
economic restructuring. He also expressed the hope that the OECD
would further its cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan Meets Vietnamese Visitors
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, secretary of the Central Political Science and Law
Committee under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), today met with Phan The Hung, chief of the Internal
Affairs Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
 Report on Religious Persecution in China Groundless: FM
Spokesman
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department report accusing China of persecution
of religious groups is groundless and wantonly interferes in China
's internal affairs, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi said here
today at a routine press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the report, submitted recently by the U.S. State
Department to U.S. Congress, is a gratuitous attack on China's
religious policy.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Gong group is not a religious organization, but an
anti-science, anti-humanity and anti-society group which actually
denigrates religions by falsely using the terms of Buddhism,
Taoism and Christianity to describe its philosophy, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Falun Gong cult poses a serious threat to
society and has been adamantly opposed by the people, particularly
religious personages.
</P>
<P>
To improve the implementation of the policy of freedom in
religion and to defend normal religious activities, the Chinese
government outlawed the cult, an act firmly approved by personages
in the religious circle and people with religious beliefs, Sun
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of the practitioners of the Falun
Gong cult have been freed from the cult group, and no question
whatsoever about them will be raised in this regard, Sun said,
adding that only very few members of the cult group who have
violated laws have been arrested and their trial will be conducted
according to legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the allegations that over 40 Christians in Tanghe
County, Henan Province, were "persecuted", that the religious
freedom of the Catholics was restrained, and that some Catholic
dissidents were "persecuted", are sheer fabrications.
</P>
<P>
Sun reiterated that Chinese citizens' rights to religious
freedom and participation in normal religious activities are
protected by the Constitution and laws. Religious activities
should be carried out within the frame of law, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Those citizens who believe in religion and those who do not
enjoy equal rights and have the same obligations before law, with
no one enjoying special privileges, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who breaks the law and commits crime will be
investigated and held responsible for their law-breaking
activities in accordance with the law, regardless of whether he
believes in religion or not.
</P>
<P>
No body in China is detained or arrested because of religious
belief, Sun stressed.

<HEADLINE> HK Initiates Workplace English Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A steering committee on the
English in the workplace campaign was set up in Hong Kong Thursday
in a bid to improve English proficiency of the local workforce.
</P>
<P>
The committee will advise the local governments on all aspects
of the planning, organization and implementation of the English in
the Workplace Campaign with a view to heightening awareness of the
importance of English and raising the standard of workplace
English in the community, said Joseph W. P. Wong, secretary for
Education and Manpower.
</P>
<P>
It will be working in collaboration with the Standing Committee
on Language Education and Research (SCOLAR), which has earmarked
around a total of 62 million HK dollars (about eight million U.S.
dollars) to support the campaign, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
"To maintain Hong Kong's competitive edge as an international
center of business, finance and tourism, our workforce must
maintain a high standard of English," Wong said.
</P>
<P>
The year-long campaign, expected to commence in January 2000,
seeks to heighten the community's overall awareness of the
importance of English at work, and of the need to maintain a high
level of bilingualism in our society," the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
The major elements of the Campaign will comprise a 50-million-
HK-dollar incentive grants scheme to fund English Language
training programs for employees, a business-school collaboration
program and a series of publicity programs and events aimed at
various sectors of the community, Wong added.

<HEADLINE> Jardine Insurance Brokers Penalized in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese insurance
authority today announced the imposition of a major penalty
against the British Jardine Insurance Brokers Limited for engaging
in unauthorized brokerage business in China.
</P>
<P>
A bulletin from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC)
released here said the company's Beijing representative office
will be closed, and its chief representative in Beijing, Wang
Jiacong, will be disqualified from future service in the insurance
sector.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC launched a major campaign against illegal operators
and businesses in the insurance brokerage market in March this
year.
</P>
<P>
During this campaign, Jardine Insurance Brokers was found to be
engaging in unauthorized brokerage activities through its offices
in Hong Kong and on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC bulletin points out that Jardine Insurance Brokers
persisted with its illegal business even while the rectification
campaign was ongoing.
</P>
<P>
The company also attempted to hide its unlicensed business and
refused to admit that it had violated the Chinese insurance laws
and regulations, the CIRC said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the penalty is in accordance with the insurance
laws and is aimed at maintaining order in the insurance market and
protecting the interest of the insured.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC reiterated that overseas insurance organizations and
their representative offices in China shall not engage in any
insurance, reinsurance or brokerage business without its approval.

<HEADLINE> China's Computers Unaffected by "9999" Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The date September 9, 1999 may
have meant disaster for computers elsewhere in the world, as some
feared that computers could read the date code "9999" as a shut-
down order, but so far there have been no reports of such a
failure in China.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the special panel dealing with the Y2K
millennium bug in China confirmed this, and said the panel will
keep in touch with the country's key sectors for another two days
to stave off any possible computer failures.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has attached great importance to
addressing the "millennium bug," and has carried out several
thorough tests on computers nationwide. There is little chance of
computers being hit by bugs today, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Rising Technologies Co. Ltd., China's leading
software company, also reported no appeals for help today.
</P>
<P>
Han Xiaoqing, in charge of the technical department of Rising,
said that many of China's sectors were computerized later than in
Western countries and therefore almost all computers in China are
now Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug, or the year 2000 (Y2K) problem, is a
holdover from the old method of coding the year as a two-digit
number in computer systems, which could cause computers to read
the year 2000 as the year 1900. There are also several other
dangerous days, including September 9, because of this old
practice.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Information Industry in China has long been
committed to the resolution of the millennium bug problem, and has
kept an close eye on key state enterprises which are the backbone
of China's national economy.
</P>
<P>
The number of computers in China is now surging at an annual
rate of 50 percent, and the country now has more than ten million
computers.

<HEADLINE> No Y2K Hitch Reported in Singapore Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Various Computer systems in
Singapore successfully sailed through the critical transition to
September 9, 1999, the date the Y2K bug was likely to strike,
according to local reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a teletext broadcast titled "All Well on 9-9-99 with No Y2K
Hitch", the Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS) said the
arrival of 9-9-99, a precursor to the millennium bug, has not
caused any computer problems.
</P>
<P>
TCS quoted Singapore National Computer Board (NCB) as having
said the so-called "four 9s day" had gone smoothly overnight and
there had been no report of incidents.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the TradeNet system involving key trade
agencies such as Singapore Trade Development Board said business
was as usual for the trading community and the 2,600 registered
users of the TradeNet system, elaborating that "between 0000 hours
and 1200 hours on September 9, 1999, a total of 9,668 declarations
were processed by the system without any Y2K glitches."
</P>
<P>
TCS noted that government agencies had remained on alert in
case computer problems cropped up and they used the occasion to
rehearse their contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
Also quoting the NCB, TCS said today's zero incidence is due to
the high level of preparedness for Y2K compliance in various
sectors including the financial, telecommunications, utilities,
transportation and healthcare sectors.
</P>
<P>
The spread of nines could disrupt systems because some old
computers are programmed to read "9999" as a command to shut down.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug also arises from old programs using only two
figures to denote the year, creating the danger of computer chaos
when clocks tick from "99" to "00" at midnight on December 31,
1999.

<HEADLINE> Greek Mobile Phone Companies Blamed for Poor Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President
Apostolos Kaklamanis Thursday criticized local mobile phone
companies for failing to deliver in the immediate aftermath of
Tuesday's earthquake, which killed 75 persons and injured more
than 2,000 others.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Parliament, Kaklamanis said that at a critical
moment, the mobile phone providers showed that they were not in
the position to provide even the most basic of services.
</P>
<P>
While praising the state-run Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization (OTE) for its excellent operations, he urged the
Greek government to preoccupy itself with the mobile phone
companies which began with capital of 30 billion drachmas (about 1
billion U.S. dollars) and have collected profits of trillions.

<HEADLINE> Layoff Plan by Auto Tire Group Takes French City by Surprise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The surprise announcement on
Wednesday by the automobile tire group Michelin that it will lay
off 7,500 workers in Europe in three years has taken by surprise
Clermont-Ferrand, a south-central French city where the
headquarters of Michelin are based.
</P>
<P>
Michelin, one of the world's biggest automobile tire producers,
employs 75,000 workers in Europe, including 32,000 in France.
</P>
<P>
All the labor unions have protested the decision of Michelin,
whose details are yet to be made known.
</P>
<P>
Union leaders in Clermont-Ferrand said that the plan by the
management is a "blow with club" to employees, who got the news
from the press and were not pre-consulted by the employers.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that Michelin decided to down-size the labor
force after its profits rose by 17 percent in the early half this
year.
</P>
<P>
They accused the management of Michelin of only caring about
the shareholders and caring nothing about the labor force.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist mayor of Clermont-Ferrand, Serge Godard, said
that his city has lost 10,000 jobs because of layoffs by Michelin
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
The unions will organize a protest rally on September 21 in
Clermont-Ferrand.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China has loosened restrictions
on the business scope of overseas-funded investment companies, a
senior Chinese official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded investment companies now will be allowed to
sell products made by their plants in China, provide
transportation and storage services to their subsidiaries, and
export products made in China that are not covered by export
quotas and licenses, said Ma Xiuhong, Assistant Minister of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, at the ongoing
Third China Fair for International Investment and Trade.
</P>
<P>
"This decision aims to enlarge the business scope of investment
companies and help them move toward operating in accord with
international practices," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Ma expressed hope that this move will not affect the main
function of these companies, which is investment.
</P>
<P>
China began to experiment with opening overseas-funded
investment companies at the beginning of the 1990s, and so far has
approved about 200 such companies, with combined investments of 18
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Russia Insists on Observance of ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Georgy Mamedov told his U.S. counterpart, Strobe Talbott, Thursday
that Moscow insists on "the strict observance of the cornerstone
agreements" on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry did not
specify which particular "cornerstone agreements" are meant, but
the Interfax news agency said it conveys Russia's opposition to U.
S. plans to alter the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty (ABM).
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, during the consultations held
Wednesday and Thursday, "the sides discussed the most important
aspects of the Russian-American agenda" on the basis of the
agreements reached by the Russian and U.S. presidents in Cologne
in June 1999, and by the Russian foreign minister and the U.S.
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
"Special emphasis was laid on the problems of disarmament,"
the document says.
</P>
<P>
The next round of consultations on security and disarmament is
to be held in Washington, the Foreign Ministry announced.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the widely spread media reports
of Russia's alleged high-level corruption and money laundering
through U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, who left for New York earlier Thursday, said he had
the impression that Russian leaders are very seriously concerned
about the problem of corruption.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia and the United States must work jointly to
ensure Russia's transformation along the road of democratic
reform, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Surging Crowds Recall Late Chairman Mao (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Born to a farmer's family in central China's Hunan Province,
Mao had lofty ambitions, and led the CPC members in overturning
the old system and founding the People's Republic of China. As the
founder of New China, his achievements and thoughts continue to
have a great influence on the Chinese society today.
</P>
<P>
Mao passed away on September 9, 1976. Since then, thousands of
people have journeyed to Beijing to show their respects to this
late leader as if he were a member of their family.
</P>
<P>
His grandson, Mao Xinyu, wiped tears away saying, " I came here
to see my grandfather twice a year -- his birthday, on November 26,
and today." Mao Xinyu's parents, Mao Anqing and Shao Hua, as well
as other relatives, also came to the hall today.
</P>
<P>
A graduate of the People's University and now a research fellow
with the Party History Center of the CPC Central Committee, Mao
Xinyu respects his grandfather as "a great leader of the Chinese
people, a great Marxist and a great national hero."
</P>
<P>
The Memorial Hall was completed in May 1977 and opened to the
public on September 9, 1977, on the first anniversary of Mao's
death. To date, a total of 120 million overseas and domestic
visitors have viewed Mao's body, and nearly 80 foreign leaders
have come to show their respects.
</P>
<P>
In the first hour after the hall opened this morning, there
were more than 5,000 people waiting to view Mao, according to
officials at the hall.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 people forming a
200-meter-long line gathered in front of the Memorial Hall of
Chairman Mao Zedong in Tiananmen Square here early this morning.
</P>
<P>
They were there to await the reopening of the hall and to
express their feelings for the late Chinese leader, who passed
away 23 years ago today.
</P>
<P>
Dai Yunpeng, standing in the first row of the line, has made it
a habit to recall Mao here for the past ten years. He said," It is
the last time we have the opportunity to show our respect for
Chairman Mao this century. Today is of great significance also
because it is near the 50th birthday of the People's Republic."
</P>
<P>
The oldest man in the line, Zhao Jingchang from central China's
Henan Province, had something wrong with his leg but persisted in
waiting in front of the hall. His son said, "To be in the presence
of Chairman Mao is a long-cherished dream of my father."
</P>
<P>
Zhao was wearing his best clothes for the occasion as he said,
"I will see Chairman Mao in a high spirit."
</P>
<P>
The base of the white jade statue of Mao was awash with fresh
flowers shortly after the hall opened at eight-thirty.
</P>
<P>
In a crystal coffin, the remains of the great leader rests
peacefully in flowers, covered with the flag of the Communist
Party of China (CPC). Visitors silently walked around the coffin
to view Mao's face. And often their eyes welled with tears.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Has Less Strikes in First Eight Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The labor strikes in the
Philippines fell to 43, or down by 47 percent during the first
eight months of the year, the Department of labor and Employment
disclosed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a report to Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma, the
National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB) said the actual
labor strikes declared as of August 31, 1999, were lower compared
with the 81 cases during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
NCMB Executive Director Buenaventura Magsalin said the result
also recorded a marked decline in the number of workers who
participated in the organized work-stoppages.
</P>
<P>
Latest NCMB data showed there were only 10,129 workers who
participated in strikes during the period January to August as
against the 28,665 workers who joined the picket lines during the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the decline are the growing maturity of labor
and management as well as the marked improvement in the
conciliation skills of the NCMB in helping parties resolve
dispute, Magsalin said.
</P>
<P>
Observing that there has been relative peace in the
relationships between management and labor, Magsalin said he is
optimistic this trend will be maintained towards the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NCMB also disclosed it has already slashed its
target of strike-level incidence for 1999 to only 75 cases.
</P>
<P>
Once realized, this year will be recorded as the most peaceful
in the history of industrial relations in the country.

<HEADLINE> EU Drops File on Dutch Fixed Book Price System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday that it has closed an investigation into the system for
fixed book prices in the Netherlands because the system had been
changed and will have no "appreciable effect on trade between the
European Union (EU) Member States".
</P>
<P>
The EU executive Commission said its anti-trust regulators have
conducted the probe into the effect of the fixed book price system
over the last year. But concerned parties had made certain changes
to their agreement.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, they abolished resale price maintenance for
foreign books. A possible effect on EU-wide trade has been
alleviated since the system no longer contains provisions
restrictive of competition in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
But the Commission said it will continue to watch closely the
impact of the system on EU-wide trade and will consider re-opening
the case if the factual or legal situation changes.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive would take action if the Dutch system still
has the effect of restricting imports of books or creates any
other such entry barrier or handicap. In monitoring the market,
special attention will be given to the sales of books over the
Internet, the Commission added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein is expected to make an official visit to Lebanon next
Monday, the first by a Hashemite monarch to Lebanon in three
decades.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Lebanese President's office said the king is
visiting the country at the invitation of Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud, who had concluded an official visit to Jordan in May, the
first by a Lebanese head of state to Jordan in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, the king will hold talks with the
Lebanese president, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister
Salim Hoss on bilateral ties and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Jordan and Lebanon has been improving, especially
since Syrian President Hafez Assad attended the late Jordanian
King Hussein's funeral in February and the new king made a visit
to Damascus in April.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been following the foreign policy of Syria, a main
power broker which is stationing 35,000 troops in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Jordan, Syria and Lebanon cooled after King
Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon are technically still at war with Israel
which is in control of Syrian Golan Heights and south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Introduce Technology Using Powerline to Access Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will introduce a
state-of-the-art technology using power line instead of telephone
line to access Internet in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will the first country in Asia to implement the system
which originated from Britain and is currently being tried in
Europe, according to a senior official of Fibrecomm Network (M)
Sdn Bhd which brought in the system.
</P>
<P>
The technology, called Digital Powerline (DPL), utilizes low
voltage power lines and is capable of transmitting Internet at a
speed of up to 1 Mbps or 10 times the current mode, Fibrecomm
General Manage Megat Hisham Hassan said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the conventional method, this technology does not
require any dial-up. So in places where there are no telephone
lines but have power lines, customers can still access Internet,"
Megat was quoted by Bernama news agency as saying after a function
here.
</P>
<P>
He said that the company had invested 3 million ringgit (0.789
million U.S. dollars) to conduct feasibility studies and trials
which began early this year and are expected to end by June next
year.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we can provide this technology commercially in July
next year if the trials are successful," he said.
</P>
<P>
Megat said under the system, end users need to have a
communication module connected to the power line and computers.
</P>
<P>
He said that this system offers big potential as telephone
access is not available in every place in the country but most of
them have power lines.
</P>
<P>
There is a four to five million Internet subscriber base in
Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Magazine Criticises Statement Of Taiwan Leaders (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Cross-Straits Relations
Monthly has a four-page article this month that tells the truth
about negotiations across the Taiwan Straits this decade.
</P>
<P>
There was a breakthrough in stalled negotiations across the
Straits at the end of 1987, and economic and cultural exchanges
increased. But, many problems emerged in cross-Straits relations.
To deal with the problems, the Foundation for Exchanges Across the
Taiwan Straits was established in Taiwan in November, 1990.
</P>
<P>
Then, the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's Taiwan
Affairs Office and the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office
pushed for establishing the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits in December, 1991. ARATS then promoted exchanges
and discussions with FEATS under the One China principle.
</P>
<P>
Their first negotiations were held March 23-26, 1992. FEATS was
against the One China principle and ARATS officials responded at a

was the only way to solve problems across the Straits.

In November 1992, ARATS and FEATS reached an agreement on
adhering to the One China principle but Taiwan authorities have

The ARATS proposal got a great deal of attention in Taiwan and
meant that the Taiwan authorities had to face this question. In
August that year, after many debates the Taiwan authorities
accepted the One China principle and admitted that Taiwan is part
of China.
</P>
<P>
From October 28 to 30, 1992, there were new negotiations in
Hong Kong, after which the two in November seemed to reach an
understanding on adhering to the One China principle but did not
discuss the meaning of "One China" and said nothing of an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui then went further down the road of divisiveness
and Taiwan authorities distorted the understanding reached by
ARATS and FEATS by defending Lee's recent "two states" statement,
the article says, emphasizing that the the understanding of ARATS
and FEATS of November 1992 is a part of history and can not be
changed and political and economic dialogues between them can
resume only if they are based on the One China principle.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Prime Minister Calls for Healthier Diet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong Thursday urged Singaporeans to have healthier diet
besides persevering non-smoking and physical exercise.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the National Healthy Lifestyle
Campaign 1999 and the Singapore Helping Employees Achieve
Life-Time Health Award presentation ceremony, Goh said, "I urge
all lovers of good food - in other words, all true Singaporeans to
support these efforts (for healthier diet)."
</P>
<P>
"With a healthier diet, we can live longer to enjoy the
excellent range of food in Singapore," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the prime minister, Singapore's 1998 national
health survey showed that after seven years of efforts the
percentage of Singaporeans who exercise regularly has risen from
13.6 percent in 1992 to 16.8 percent in 1998 while the proportion
of smokers has dropped from 18.3 percent to 15 percent in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
He said the survey also found Singaporeans are now more aware
of the need for a healthy diet and nearly 45 percent of
Singaporeans now make conscious effort to consume less fatty food,
sugar and red meat compared to 28 percent in a similar survey in
1993.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that the survey also showed that the rates
of high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol have increased
over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
Citing the survey's finding that a high proportion of the
working population still eat out at hawker centers and workplace
canteens, Goh said this underlines the need for foodstall
operators to serve healthier dishes.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the efforts by the Singapore Ministry of Health
(MOH) to influence cooking practices not just in the homes but
also in the 140 hawker centers and over 80 eating establishments
throughout Singapore including best-known restaurants, Goh said,
"We have to press on with our healthy lifestyle campaign." He
urged MOH to extend its health promotion efforts to the work
place.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also announced the formation of a Tripartite
Committee that will take health promotion at the workplace to a
higher plane.

<HEADLINE> China's Building Materials Industry More Open to Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China will open wider for
foreign investment in the building materials industry and expects
to make major progress in this sector, a senior Chinese official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Lei Qianzhi, vice director of the State Administration of
Building Materials Industry, said that China has formulated its
investment guidelines for foreign investors according to the
requirements of the development of China's domestic building-
materials market to ensure that foreign investors obtain optimum
returns on their investments.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium here on the building-materials market at the
Third China Fair for International Investment and Trade, Lei said
that foreign funds are welcomed for investment in restructuring
outmoded enterprises to speed up reform of traditional industries
such as cement, glass, and natural stone.
</P>
<P>
Overseas funds are encouraged for high-tech industries, new
building materials, processed products of non-metal materials,
inorganic non-metal materials, building-materials equipment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment is especially sought for central and western
China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds can also become involved in property
reorganization projects such as purchasing and merging building-
materials enterprises, replenishing the working capitals of
enterprises, and paying debts for these enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is offering national treatment to foreign-invested
building-material enterprises and improving the provision of quick
and convenient services to foreign business people investing in
building materials, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, China has approved 9,500 direct overseas-funded
enterprises with contracted investment of 18 billion U.S. dollars
and actual investment of 7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Holderbank, Saint-Gobain, Lafarge, Boluo, Pilkington, Taiheiyo
Cement Co., Daewoo, American Standard, Toto and other established
international building-materials groups have cooperated with their
Chinese counterparts or independently set up solely funded
enterprises in the country.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo (Shandong) Cement Co. Ltd., Shanghai Yaohua Pilkington
Glass Co. Ltd., and Qingyuan Huamei Sanitary Ware Co. Ltd. all
have become pillars in China's cement, glass and ceramic sectors,
and have achieved good economic returns on their investments.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of people killed in
a powerful explosion that ripped through an apartment building has
risen to 21 by Thursday as rescue efforts continue at the site
where some 140 people are feared still trapped under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are trying to establish the cause of the tragedy,
which was earlier believed to be a gas explosion.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said that law enforcement
agencies are working in several possibilities, adding that the
explosion may have been caused by a bomb planted by terrorists,
although no sign of any explosive device was found in the building
yet.
</P>
<P>
"Specialists must be given time to make a conclusion on the
causes of the explosion," the Interfax news agency quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Those injured in the blast in the nine-storey building in
Gurianova Street, numbering 73, are being treated in seven
hospitals across the capital city. Most of them suffered burns.
</P>
<P>
A total of 152 people have been rescued from under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred in Moscow's Pechatniki district around
midnight Thursday. Two sections of the six-section building
collapsed.
</P>

A fire that flared up immediately after the blast was put out
two hours later. Heavy smoke has hampered rescue efforts that
involved about 900 people and 200 pieces of special equipment,
Interfax reported.

About 1,200 people were evacuated from the ruined building and
from a neighboring apartment house, which was also damaged.

<HEADLINE> China Provides More Opportunities for Job-Seekers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year is
the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China. The past five decades of economic achievement has attracted
the attention of the world. Xinhua began issuing a series of
stories on the nation's economy on August 17. This is the 19th in
the series.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)
show that in the past 50 years the number of employed people in
China's cities grew by nearly thirteen-fold, and the unemployment
rate decreased to 3.1 percent last year from 23.6 percent in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"This is an outstanding achievement for such a developing and
populous country as China," said a senior NBS official.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China had an employed urban population of more than
200 million, a staggering increase from the 15 million of 50 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Most economists agree that rapid economic development of China
over the past several decades not only created more jobs, but also
now provides job-seekers more choices.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises were considered the best places to work
20 years ago, but this is changing as non-state firms are becoming
more appealing to those now entering the job market.

<TEXT>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, there are nearly
100,000 private firms, which in the past four years have absorbed
180,000 employees laid off by state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The past 20 years saw the number of employed people rise
rapidly, as the private sector was given the green light to
develop, said the NBS.
</P>
<P>
As reforms change the country's economy and employment
structure, so people's ways of thinking are changing.
</P>
<P>
High salaries and the freedom to show one's competence have
become the major standards for more and more people when they seek
employment. Some are even leaving their former stable and
comfortable jobs in state-owned units to try the more competitive
world of private and foreign-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, more than 78 million people were employed by private
firms, according to the NBS.
</P>
<P>
Stiff competition and the development of education in the
country also is producing higher-quality employees. Last year, one-
half of all employees in China had at least a high school
education.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, economists warn that the baby boom of the 1960s
and 1970s is a major reason for the current employment boom, while
the reform of state-owned enterprises has created a surplus of
workers in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is aware of this, and has been taking
steps to solve the problem. A complete network of social security
has been established, with more than 80 million people joining the
basic pension system, and nearly 80 million now covered by
unemployment insurance.

<P>
XIAMEN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China's huge potential mobile
telecommunication market has created a great number of business
opportunities for overseas investors, an industry official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
China has been working to upgrade its mobile telecommunication
industry by fostering innovation and using advanced technology
from overseas, said Ma Xiuhong, assistant minister of the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, at a forum on
international cooperation in mobile telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
This year, Ma said, China has adopted the policy of increasing
investment to stimulate economic growth, and investments in fixed
assets will rise by more than 20 percent, most of which will be
used for infrastructure including telecommunications and housing.
</P>
<P>
Ma said overseas investors are encouraged to engage in
manufacturing advanced telecommunication equipment and components
and parts in China through cooperative development, technology
transfer, and joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Ma added that overseas-funded enterprises are also encouraged
to establish sales networks abroad and increase exports.
</P>
<P>
China's mobile-phone sales increased by some 10 million last
year, and experts say the growth rate will be maintained over the
next few years, and that by 2001 the country will have more than
90 million mobile-phone users.

<TEXT>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of the practitioners of the Falun
Gong cult have been freed from the cult group, and no question
whatsoever about them will be raised in this regard, Sun said,
adding that only very few members of the cult group who have
violated laws have been arrested and their trial will be conducted
according to legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the allegations that over 40 Christians in Tanghe
County, Henan Province, were "persecuted", that the religious
freedom of the Catholics was restrained, and that some Catholic
dissidents were "persecuted", are sheer fabrications.
</P>
<P>
Sun reiterated that Chinese citizens' rights to religious
freedom and participation in normal religious activities are
protected by the Constitution and laws. Religious activities
should be carried out within the frame of law, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Those citizens who believe in religion and those who do not,
enjoy equal rights and have the same obligations before law, with
no one enjoying special privileges, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who breaks the law and commits crime will be
investigated and held responsible for their law-breaking
activities in accordance with law, regardless of whether he
believes in religion or not.
</P>
<P>
No body in China is detained or arrested because of religious
belief, Sun stressed.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rebound, Dollar Falls in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rebounded in Tokyo
Thursday following the announcement of an unexpected rise in Japan
's gross domestic product (GDP) for the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged 36.18 points, or 0.21
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 17,677.56.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, increased 5.05 points or 0.34 percent to 1,
507.62.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Economic Planning Agency said before the market opened
that Japan's GDP grew a real 0.2 percent in the second quarter
from the previous one, marking its second straight quarterly rise.
</P>
<P>
Japan's private economic institutions had predicted a slight
contraction in the GDP.
</P>
<P>
After hitting the day's high of 17,859.71 in early morning
trading, the key Nikkei index lost its upward momentum, as the yen
's upturn against the U.S. dollar, stirred by the strong GDP data,
made investors hesitant to buy stocks further, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section came to 473.99 million shares,
slightly down from 484.62 million shares Thursday.
</P>
<P>
NEC Corp. was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers led gainers
586 to 564 despite the overall gain in Nikkei index, with 185
issues ending unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar fell to the 108
yen level, pressured by heavy selling after the release of the GDP
data.
</P>
<P>
At 5 p.m., the dollar was quoted at 108.82-85 yen, down from
109.60-63 yen at 9 a.m., and from 111.05-15 yen in New York
overnight. It was traded at 111.20-24 yen in Tokyo late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
At present, construction of the second and third phases of
Qinshan and the Ling'ao and Lianyungang nuclear power stations are
all in full swing.
</P>
<P>
By early next century, China's nuclear-power generating
capacity is expected to reach 9.2 million kilowatts and, by then,
earnings from sales of nuclear power are expected to reach 30
billion yuan a year. The industrial structure of the country's
nuclear industry will be further improved at that point, coupled
with an improved economy and superior technology.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the provinces of Shandong, Fujian, Hainan, Jiangxi,
and Hunan have all been actively preparing for the creation of
their own nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
Experts here expect significant nuclear power development in
China in the next century. By the year 2010, the country's nuclear
power generating capacity will reach 20 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
And by 2020, this capacity should reach 40 million kilowatts,
and the proportion of nuclear power in the country's total power
production should increase to five percent from the existing one
percent, the CNIC experts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China's nuclear industry is
becoming a new powerhouse of the national economy and has
completed a strategic shift from military production to civilian
application through 20 years of restructuring and readjustment.
</P>
<P>
China's nuclear industry is now operating under a new system
featuring a combination of military and civilian production, and
the development of nuclear power in a diversified economy,
according to the China Nuclear Industry Corp (CNIC).
</P>
<P>
The nuclear sector has established a large number of enterprise
groups over the past few years in the more economically developed
coastal areas such as the Municipality of Shanghai and the
provinces of Guangdong and Zhejiang, and has so far developed more
than 1,500 kinds of product for civil use.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear industry has been expanding in China by maintaining
a high growth rate for years, resulting in remarkable improvement
in the country's comprehensive economic strength.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output of civil products now makes up over 80
percent of China's nuclear industrial output.
</P>
<P>
The Qinshan Nuclear Power Station in east China's Zhejiang
Province and the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station in south China's
Guangdong Province have been operating smoothly and safely, with
their combined annual power output tripling that of China's total
power output in 1952.

<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China and the
United States have agreed to resume negotiations on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO), Chinese Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with U.S. trade
representative Charlene Barshefsky, Shi said the U.S. side
proposed through many channels recently that the two countries
resume negotiations on China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
In particular, U.S. President Bill Clinton has formally
proposed to Chinese President Jiang Zemin several times that the
negotiations be resumed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Proceeding from the general prospects for maintaining the
development of Sino-U.S. relations, China agrees that the WTO
negotiations be resumed," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Describing his talks with Barshefsky as "constructive," Shi
said that he and Barshefsky discussed issues relating to the
resumption of the WTO negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, the two sides once again affirmed the importance
of China's entry into the WTO, and agreed to make joint efforts
for realizing this goal as early as possible, according to the
Chinese minister.
</P>
<P>
Shi is in Auckland to attend the two-day ministerial meeting of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum that opened
Thursday in preparation for the 7th informal meeting of APEC
leaders on September 12-13.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Shi also held talks with Russian Trade
Minister Mikhail Fradkov on issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> Computer Experts: 9999 Bug Probably No Bite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The world won't crash Thursday
when international clocks roll over to September 9, 1999,
according to computer experts.
</P>
<P>
Most of the technology experts agree that the 9999 bug will not
bite although the roots of the possible problem are the same as
for the Y2K issue, Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed "the 9999 glitch", the problem, coming out of the
shortcuts taken by an earlier generation of computer programmers,
is considered the last dress rehearsal before the Y2k bug hits the
world on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Joe Boivin, an Ottawa expert who runs a Web site devoted to the
Y2K issue, dismisses the possibility of any heavy 9999 shutdown,
saying "it is not likely to generate any significant Y2K problem."
</P>
<P>
"The 9999 code is fairly obvious to find and to fix," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most major institutions have taken some care to ensure smooth
sailing for September 9, 1999, the newspaper continued, adding
that the Royal Bank of Canada began investigating the issue a year
ago and has come to the conclusion: Its computer systems are safe.
</P>
<P>
Experts, however, do not rule out a slim chance that computers,
especially those still working with old COBOL or FORTRAN software,
may misread all those nines as permission to stop everything in
its tracks.
</P>
<P>
As a precaution, Independent Electricity Market Operator of
Canada is sending hundreds of employees into the field to watch
over generation and transmission stations that are usually
unstaffed, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 years ago, many programmers inserted "9999" to
indicate the end of a file or data transfer, unwittingly leaving a
"time bomb" to later developers, who are pulling together today to
ensure a safe transition into the new millennium.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's National Asset
Management Corporation (Danaharta) Thursday announced the
appointment of Special Administrators to take over the
administration of 9 companies in the country with immediate
effect.
</P>
<P>
The companies are Advance Synergy Furniture, Austral
Amalgamated, Instangreen Corporation, SPJ Construction,
Instangreen (Landscape), MEC Industrial Park, Perusahaan Sadur
Timah Malaysia, Seng Hup Corporation and Sportma Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Among the 9 companies, three -- Austral Amalgamated,
Instangreen Corporation and Perusahaan Sadur Timah Malaysia -- are
listed on the main board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
(KLSE), and two -- Seng Hup and Sportma Corporation-- are listed
on the Second Board of the KLSE.
</P>
<P>
The Special Administrators assume control of the assets and
affairs of the companies, effective Thursday, Danaharta said in a
statement here.
</P>
<P>
The powers of the management and the Board of the companies are
effectively suspended and only the Special Administrators can deal
with the assets of the companies, Danaharta said.
</P>
<P>
In order to preserve the assets of the companies until the
Special Administrators are able to complete their tasks, a
12-month moratorium will take effect from the date of appointment,
Danaharta said, adding during that period, no creditor may take
action against the companies.
</P>
<P>
The Special Administrators will make proposals which would be
examined by independent advisors, and if approved by Danaharta,
the Special Administrators will call for a meeting of secured
creditors to consider and vote on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
A majority in value of secured creditors present and voting at
the meeting must approve the proposal before it can be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Danaharta was specially set up last year to deal with assets of
the financial institutions and companies which faced troubles as a
result of the Asian financial crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A plot to assassinate
Philippine President Joseph Estrada and 19 other key government
and military officials has been uncovered, the official Philippine
News Agency (PNA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA quoted a military report as saying that the terror plot
was to be implemented on the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The report said the assassination plot was contained in one of
the diskettes captured by the Armed Forces of the Philippines
recently.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the captured diskette points to a plan
called "special operations" to be carried out by rebels
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The order to assassinate the president and 19 other
personalities was issued by the country's rebel National
Democratic Front on May 30 this year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The planned "special operations" are part of a larger tactical
offensive to be carried out by the underground terrorists movement
in the second half of 1999, including raids, ambuscades and
attacks on military and civilian installations.
</P>
<P>
The president has been properly informed about the
assassination threat and the government has taken action on the
matter, said the report.

BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Luneng Taishan kept
pressure on leaders Liaoning Fushun after beating Beijing Guo'an 2-
0 in the 22nd round of the Chinese first division soccer league on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The win narrowed the gap between Liaoning Fushun and Luneng
Taishan to three points with four rounds of competitions remaining
this season.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Fushan saw their winning streak stopped by giant
killers Jilin Aodong. Zhen Dongqi opened the scoring for the Jilin
team at the 58th minute. Zhan Yuning levelled the score 1-1 at
the 68th minute only to see Wang Guangwei wrapped up the game 2-1
for Jilin Aodong with a fierce long-range shot at the 81st minute.
</P>
<P>
In the match between Luneng Taishan and Beijing Guo'an which
was played at Jinan, Luneng Taishan dominated the match from the
very beginning. Forward Su Maozhen made it 1-0 for the home team
at the 35th minute.
</P>
<P>
The Shandong team continued to press forward in the second half
and the score became 2-0 after they converted a penalty shot at
the 55th minute. Li Yi of Beijing Guo'an was sent off due to a
rough tackle and that denied any chance of coming back for Beijing
Guo'an.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Dalian Wanda, only one point above the
relegation zone, earned 3 points after a hard-fought 2-0 victory
over Qingdao Hainiu. Forward Orlando scored twice at the 2nd and
61st minutes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Report on Religious Persecution in China Groundless: FM Spokesman (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
report accusing China of persecution of religious groups is
groundless and wantonly interferes in China's internal affairs,
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi said here today at a routine
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the report, submitted recently by the U.S. State
Department to U.S. Congress, is a gratuitous attack on China's
religious policy.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Gong group is not a religious organization, but an
anti-science, anti-humanity and anti-society group which actually
denigrates religions by falsely using the terms of Buddhism,
Taoism and Christianity to describe its philosophy, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Falun Gong cult poses a serious threat to
society and has been adamantly opposed by the people, particularly
religious personages.
</P>
<P>
To improve the implementation of the policy of freedom of
religion and to defend normal religious activities, the Chinese
government outlawed the cult, an act firmly approved by personages
in the religious circle and people with religious beliefs, Sun
pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Claims Fully Committed to IPR Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong claimed Thursday
that its customs was fully committed to intellectual property
rights (IPR) protection and will keep maintaining Hong Kong as a
pirate-free zone.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon of the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce, John Tsang Chun-wah, commissioner of Hong Kong Customs
and Excise, said the territory was no longer a haven for
counterfeit goods.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy to tell you that we have blinded the pirate in
the remaining eye. The piracy situation is now under control,"
said Tsang.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that since last September, customs officers had
cracked 11 underground CD factories and seized 18 production lines
worth some 100 million HK dollars (12.82 million U.S dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tsang noted that up to the end of August about 750 shops had
been raided, over 600 people arrested, and two million pirated
products seized in a mere two months' time.
</P>
<P>
"To these pirates Hong Kong has not been the haven they thought
it was. In the past couple of months it has been plain hell,"
Tsang added.
</P>
<P>
However Tsang said public demand for counterfeit goods would
continue to fuel production, and that the city was aiming to bring
in stiffer jail terms and fines to keep the pirates at bay.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Seeks Damages From India for Downing Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is considering
various options for seeking damages and compensation from India
for shooting down a Pakistani Navy aircraft last month.
</P>
<P>
A final decision in this regard would be taken next week,
Minister for Law and Justice Khalid Anwar said during his talks
with the media here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan can approach the international court of justice for
recovering the loss, which was caused due to "unlawful and
unprovoked" Indian aggression against the unarmed Pakistani
aircraft, killing 16 persons on board, said Anwar.
</P>
<P>
"Many options are before us to take appropriate action for
seeking justice," he added. Pakistan has demanded 60.2 million
U.S. dollars from New Delhi as compensation.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has also lodged a complaint with the United Nations
over the downing of the navy aircraft. Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz addressed a letter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
calling the Indian action "an act of military aggression."
</P>
<P>
Aziz had asked Annan to send a fact-finding mission to Pakistan
to investigate the incident. He said that the shooting-down of the
Pakistani plane soon after the Kargil crisis in Kashmir had
further increased tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said apart from taking up the matter with the world court
of justice, Pakistan can consider other options for seeking
justice.

Dynasty (1368-1644) originally carved 14,278 stone tablets which
were kept in the caves. In 1957, 10,082 tablets were excavated
from caves, and later stored in a warehouse.
</P>
<P>
The city government decided to re-house the relics because they
were eroding.

advice on the preservation of the remaining 4,000 stone tablets
still in the Shijing Mountain Sutras Cave.

<P>
MACAO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Macao residents will have hosts

</P>
<P>
An artistic evening party will be held on the night of December

</P>
<P>
The committee expected to receive 10 million patacas (1.25
million dollars) to fund the expenses of celebration activities. "
In addition to donating money, many residents give up their spare
time and take an active part in relevant rehearsals," Ng said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> HK Legislative Market Reform Pressing Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong SAR government
is progressing in full steam on its legislative reform in a drive
to strengthen Hong Kong's position in the rapidly changing
international financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of legislative reform is to provide a modern
and flexible regulatory framework for the securities and futures
markets, said a government spokesman Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Legislative Council will start a series of
meetings Friday with representatives from the Financial Services
Bureau (FSB) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to
discuss the new proposals at its Sub-committee on Securities and
Futures Bill, the FSB spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on the review of licensing regime for
market intermediaries, introduction of more proportionate
disciplinary sanctions, and establishment of the Securities and
Futures Appeals Tribunal, the FSB spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Under the streamlined licensing regime proposed in the bill,
intermediaries will only be required to apply for a single license
for conducting regulated activities in different markets and
products. This will reduce the cost of compliance and hence
regulatory burden on the intermediaries, he said.
</P>
<P>
As an effort to strengthen the supervision of intermediaries,
the bill will introduce intermediate sanctions which are more
proportionate to the gravity of the misconduct, without causing
undue harm to innocent parties like the intermediary's clients and
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
To provide for additional checks and balances, a statutory
Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal is proposed to be
established. The Tribunal will be chaired by a High Court Judge
and include a number of market practitioners of high standing.
</P>
<P>
Other major proposals scheduled for discussion at following
meetings are establishment of the Market Misconduct Tribunal,
enhancing Securities and Futures Commission's inquiry powers into
listed companies, and disclosure of interests in securities, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The new framework will be on a par with international
standards to facilitate our competition in the increasingly
globalized market. We are pressing ahead with an aim to introduce
the bill into LegCo by the end of the year," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Seeks Church's Support in Anti-corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has called upon the church to join in the anti-corruption
crusade in the west African country, The Guardian newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The church cannot be indifferent to the corruption of its
members. It cannot stand by and do nothing when some of its
members live above their means while others grovel in poverty,"
the president said through his Minister of Justice Kanu Agabi
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo is in Libya attending a special summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Representing the president, Agabi said at the second plenary of
the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria in the northern city of
Jos that the clerics have a duty to challenge and question church
members who live above their means.
</P>
<P>
"The failure of the nation is the failure of the church and
that the failure of the citizen is the failure of the church," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the church "to go after those who are lost to
drugs, who are lost to crime, who are lost to corruption and other
forms of immorality. "
</P>
<P>
Noting that the constitution recognizes and guarantees freedom
of conscience and religion, he said the adherents of such
religions are also " citizens of one country."
</P>
<P>
The president advised them to imbibe the virtue of forgiveness
which is one of the cardinal pillars of their faith, instead of
looking upon the privileges of any religion as confined or
restricted to any tribe, race or generation.
</P>
<P>
The church leaders were also urged to restrain their members
from the kind of ethnic carnage that was witnessed recently in
Shagamu and Kano, while appealing for calm and patience in the
Niger Delta.

<HEADLINE> Athens Quake Death Toll Climbs to 72 As Rescue Work Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Tuesday's
devastating earthquake in the Greek capital of Athens rose to 72
Thursday as Greek and foreign rescue teams continued their work in
the rubble of collapsed buildings in the quake-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Officials believe that the death toll could rise to 90 or 100.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 rescue teams, including those from Turkey, France,
Germany, Switzerland, Ukraine and Israel, are making efforts to
dig out persons still buried in debris in 13 worst-hit locations.
</P>
<P>
They have so far managed to pull 86 persons alive out of the
rubble of collapsed houses and factories, but more than 50 persons
are still missing.
</P>
<P>
An Austrian rescue team is expected to arrive in Athens later
Thursday to assist operations.
</P>
<P>
Besides the relief measures announced on Wednesday by Greek
Prime Minister Costas Simitis, engineers have already inspected
more than 3,000 buildings and houses in the stricken northwestern
Athens, of which about 45 percent are considered inhabitable, 41
percent reparable, and 14 percent will have to be demolished.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale rocked Athens
Tuesday afternoon with its epicenter in the Mount Parnitha region,
some 20 kilometers northwest of Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece is the sixth most seismically active country in the
world, with earthquakes occurring in the country on an average
rate of once in every five years.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Pledges to Restore Order in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie said here Thursday that his government will make every
effort to restore security and order in violence-torn East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The president made the pledge when meeting with a U.N. Security
Council team at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia has asked the international community, especially
the United Nations to give an opportunity to Indonesia for the
return of security and order there (East Timor)," Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas, who accompanying the president during the meeting,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The five-member U.N. mission arrived here Wednesday to exchange
views with the Indonesian government on the latest developments in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the question of sending peace-keeping forces to
East Timor, Alatas said there are two obstacles which should be
cleared for the sending of the peace-keeping forces. Firstly, he
said, the making of the decision will cost a long time because
countries which want to send forces should be appointed and who
will finance the action. Secondly, Indonesia is till responsible
for the security in East Timor in accordance with an agreement
signed by the U.N., Indonesia and Portugal in May this year.
</P>
<P>
And meanwhile, he said, East Timor is still part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In the August 30 direct autonomy ballot, 78.5 percent of East
Timorese voters cast their votes for independence, instead of
wide-ranging autonomy proposed by the Indonesian government in
January this year.
</P>
<P>
But, clashes between pro-integration and pro-independence
groups have taken place in East Timor since the announcement of
the ballot results on September 4. Reports said dozens of people
have been killed and more than 100,000 people have fled to nearby
provinces of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian military declared a state of emergency in East
Timor on Tuesday morning in a bid to control the violence. The
period of the emergency will last till the situation returns to
normal.
</P>
<P>
Alatas was optimistic that the security situation in East Timor
could soon return to normal as there was no burning and shooting
in the past 24 hours there. So, he held that until now there is no
need for sending peace-keeping forces from foreign countries to
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
However, Alatas said, the president told the U.N. mission that
Indonesia is ready to accept humanitarian aid for the East
Timorese refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. mission will hold talks with Defense Minister
and Armed Forces chief Wiranto on Friday morning. The delegation
will ask for a visit to East Timor. Alatas predicted that the
delegation could go to Dili, capital of East Timor, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Holds Seminar on Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A two-day anti-drug
national seminar began here Thursday to discuss ways to timely and
effectively reduce and prevent increasing drug abuse in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from government sectors, police, provinces, the
United Nations and other international organizations are attending
the meeting organized by United Nations International Drug Control
Program and the National Authority for Combating Drugs of
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"Drugs are ravaging the Cambodian society especially among the
youths and are becoming major barriers to the development of the
country," a government official told the National Seminar on Drug
Abuse Prevention and Drug Demand Reduction.
</P>
<P>
"The elimination of drug abuses is the removal of the roots of
human trafficking and exploitation and social anarchy," the
official added.
</P>
<P>
The seminar aims to bring together key authorities,
international and local agencies and other professionals with
strong interest in drug abuse prevention and demand reduction
issues and make recommendations for promoting drug abuse
prevention and drug demand reduction in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"Today's Cambodia is not only a transit country for drugs but
also a place of selling and use. Many people working near the Thai
border have died from over-use of amphetamines," according to Uk
Vithun, Minister of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Amphetamines were increasingly common in border provinces such
as Koh Kong, Battambang and Banteay Meanchey, Uk Vithun added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting called on the government and authorities to enhance
drug education among the youths and families, to take strict
actions and sufficient procedures to prevent the influx of drugs
and to crack down and educate drug abusers.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A closure was imposed on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
because of fears that Islamic terrorists will try to stage a
large-scale bombing during the Jewish New Year holiday, which
starts Friday.
</P>
<P>
The closure bars all West Bank and Gaza Palestinians from
entering Israel. Palestinians will only be allowed to enter in an
emergency or if they hold a special permit.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli General Security Service Shin Bet will recommend
that the government implement harsh measures against the Islamic
Movement in Israel. Investigation regarding two car bombing
incidents early this week in northern Israel reveals that members
of the Islamic Movement were deeply involved in terrorist activity
and had close contacts with Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The religious party Shas is prepared to compromise on a
"recovery plan" after its 17 legislators boycotted a
parliamentary vote on the Sharm El Sheikh agreement because of a
crisis over the government funding for religious educational
networks.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A total of 199 Palestinian prisoners were released Thursday
morning, the first concrete implementation of the Sharm El Sheikh
Memorandum. On Wednesday night, the Knesset (parliament) approved
the accord by a relatively small majority.

<HEADLINE> Two-thirds of Ethiopians at Risk of Malaria: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 40 million
Ethiopians, or two- thirds of the country's 60-million population,
are threatened by malaria, one of major killer diseases in
country, the Monitor newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Malaria often attacks after the main rainy season which falls
between September and November. Usually, up to five million are
infected with the disease every year, according to the Health
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the ministry have advised people to pour burned
engine oil or kerosene to swamps and ponds to kill malaria carrier
-- mosquitos and their eggs.
</P>
<P>
The burned out engine oil and kerosene will have no major
ecological effect, said Daniel Kebede, who is working for the
ministry's malaria control unit.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has pledged about 10 million U.S.
dollars for the malaria control program in 1999/2000 fiscal year,
up from last year's budget of about four million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The annual National Malaria Social Mobilization Week was
observed from August 24 to 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
The government-sponsored campaign was designed to further
bolster the participation of governmental and non-governmental
organizations as well as the public at large in the fight against
the infective disease.
</P>
<P>
Although capital Addis Ababa is regarded as a malaria free
zone, people living in parts of the city, such as near the Bole
International Airport, are also at risk of malaria, medical
workers said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Launches First Portrait Currency Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Thursday launched
its first portrait currency notes in history -- the Presidential
Notes - as part of the national millennium celebration.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Commissioners of Currency of Singapore (BCCS)
introduced the entire new series of currency notes at the opening
of the Currency 21 - Presidential Notes Exhibition which was
officiated by Singapore Minister for Finance Richard Hu.
</P>
<P>
The newly-introduced portrait series, featuring the portrait of
Singapore's first President Inche Yousof bin Ishak on the front of
all new notes, includes all seven denomination notes respectively
in value of 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 1,000 and 10,000 Singapore dollars
and incorporates a host of security features which combine the
most up-to-date security devices and design elements with modern
print technology.
</P>
<P>
After the issuance of the portrait series, the currently
circulated notes, including the Ship Series notes, as well as the
Orchid and Bird Series notes will remain legal tender and will
continue to be used side-by-side with the portrait series.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Richard Hu noted that the Portrait Notes contain
many "firsts" -- the first time in the history of Singapore that
the central theme of the notes features a portrait instead of
flowers, birds and ships, the first time that all seven
denominations are released together, the first time that a
Singapore currency series is designed entirely by a Singaporean.
</P>
<P>
He added that the faith and confidence that people have in
their currency is very much dependent on how secure the notes are
protected against counterfeiting. Hu said the BCCS has
incorporated many "first time" security features into the portrait
notes, which are state-of-the-art devices to combat
counterfeiting, in particular those employing reprographics
technology such as color copiers and computer scanners.

<HEADLINE> 6 Vehicles Gutted as Opposition Strike Hits Karachi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A low-intensity bomb that
went off in Karachi destroyed six vehicles Thursday as strike
called by ethnic Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) hit the port city.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press of Pakistan quoted police sources as
saying that a low intensity bomb planted in a parking lot gutted
six vehicles in Liyari in the city's south.
</P>
<P>
Liyari is believed to be a stronghold of the major opposition
party, Pakistan People's Party led by former prime minister
Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
The MQM called for a strike Thursday against the killing of its
activists early this week.
</P>
<P>
The authorities in Sindh province enforced strict security
measures to maintain law and order in Karachi. Thousands of police
and paramilitary troops have been deployed to guard government
buildings, banks and major markets.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's strike in Karachi was the second within a week. Life
was paralyzed last Saturday when traders pulled down shutters
against imposition of general sales tax by the government.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Takes Measures to Protect Property Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government will
adopt a package of strong measures to protect industrial property
rights, Vietnam's business newspaper The Saigon Times Daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The measures were proposed in view of rapidly growing disputes
on industrial property rights in Vietnam in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Trade will seek ways to further manage the use
of technology, materials and brand-names, and to better monitor
quality as well as brand-name and industrial design registration.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will keep a close watch on markets to prevent the
trading of imitations, and will issue lists of quality goods and
registered brand names.
</P>
<P>
The sources of the ministry said that police and market
monitoring forces would coordinate to fight against the production
and trading of counterfeit goods and those found violating the
regulations would be seriously punished.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese and foreign individuals and organizations annually
submitted some 10,000 applications for industrial property rights
protection, said an official of the Industrial Property
Department.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, the official said, has so far issued 89,453 protection
certificates, with 1,200 for inventions and useful solutions,
5,244 for industrial designs and 83,000 for brand names. Of these,
Ho Chi Minh City accounts for 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most of the certificates are for food, beverages,
pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
According to police and market monitoring forces of the
country, 565 infringement cases were brought to court from 1995 to
1998, with 1,024 people found guilty of producing and storing
imitation goods.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Vietnamese police uncovered 102
cases of producing or trading of imitations, mostly in such
sectors as food, cosmetics, garments, footwear and electronic
appliances.

<HEADLINE> Elf Sinks 6th Oil Well in Angolan Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Elf Exploration Angola has
discovered another oil well in the productive east Atlantic Ocean
near Angola, the Jornal de Angola newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new oil well called "Orquidea-1" was found in the "Block
17" which has a great reserve of crude oil and is located some 200
kilometers northwest to Luanda, the capital of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Workers for the Elf Angola, an affiliated company of the French
Elf Aquitaine, sank the well in the earth crust 1,197 meters below
sea level.
</P>
<P>
Orquidea-1 is the sixth oil well found by Elf in the Block 17,
which is abundant in oil reserves and therefore, profitable.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996 when Elf became the operator of the block, the
company has successively found six productive oil wells,
respectively denominated as Girassol, Dalia, Rosa, Lirio, Tulipa
and Orquidea.
</P>
<P>
Among them, the explored oil reserves of Girassol and Dalia are
660 million and 700 million barrels while Rosa and Lirio produce
12,000 and 11000 barrels per day respectively.
</P>
<P>
Elf, as the operator of the block, invested a lot in the oil
exploration in the Block 17, accounting for 35 percent of the
total investment in the block by foreign companies including Esso
Exploration Angola, BP Exploration Angola Ltd., Den Norske Stats
Oljeseskap A.S, Norsk Hydro Asa and Fina Exploration MB, BV.
</P>
<P>
Only after Nigeria, Angola is the second largest oil-producing
country in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The southern African country has divided its seas into blocks
and foreign companies have to compete with each other for the
authorization of exploration by the Angolan government.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's 1st Under-15 Soccer Championship to Kick Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will hold its
first nation-wide under-15 youth soccer championship in capital
Addis Ababa next week, the Ethiopian Football Federation announced
here.
</P>
<P>
The tournament, scheduled to kick off at Addis Ababa Stadium on
September 14, is expected to feature youth teams from all of the
country's 11 federal states.
</P>
<P>
The competition is specially organized for those involved in
the nation-wide youth soccer training project launched a couple of
years ago, the federation said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that all participating teams should strictly
observe the age limit regulation or face stern measures for any
violation of that type.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, in the past two annual soccer competitions for the
under-17 youth, the age problem was evident.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Football Federation said that extra caution will
be taken in order to penalize those clubs who come up with players
over the age of 15.

<HEADLINE> China's Oil Sector Surges Ahead (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua)-- China produced only 120,000
tons of crude oil when New China was founded in 1949 and was
regarded as a country with poor oil resources. Fifty years later,
it is the world's fifth-largest oil producer, turning out an
annual oil output of 164 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Before 1949, the nation had three oilfields. Now there are 460,
plus 350 gasfields scattered in 25 provinces and autonomous
regions as well as in Bohai Bay, the East China Sea and the South
China Sea, according to the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC).
</P>
<P>
China has turned out a total of 3.5 billion tons of crude and
400 billion cu m of gas over the past 50 years. The country's oil,
gas and refining production capacities have reached 168 million
tons, 25 billion cu m and 250 million tons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum and gas use now accounts for over 20 percent of China
's energy consumption, compared to merely 0.07 percent in 1949,
the CNPC source said.
</P>
<P>
China has built 20,000 kilometers of pipeline, including more
than 10,000 kilometers of oil pipeline and 9,100 kilometers of gas
pipeline, which transport some 71.5 percent of the country's crude
oil.
</P>
<P>
China's oil sector started from scratch when the country's
first large-sized oilfield was discovered in Karamay, in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, in 1956. Since 1959, a
large group of major oilfields, including Daqing, Shengli and
Dagang, have been found in succession in China.
</P>
<P>
The country's total oil output increased at an annual average
rate of 23 percent during the first three decades after 1949. And
in 1978 China became the world's eighth largest oil producer,
producing 100 million tons.

<HEADLINE> APEC Must Continue to Focus on Economic Cooperation: Chinese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) must continue to focus on economic
cooperation and should not discuss political, security and social
and other sensitive or controversial issues, Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 11th APEC Ministerial Meeting, the Chinese
foreign minister noted that over the past decade since its birth,
APEC has vigorously carried out cooperation on the basis of the
voluntary will of its members and achieved marked progress.
</P>
<P>
"Ten years' development has already turned APEC into a forum
for its members to conduct consultations on an equal footing and
mutually beneficial cooperation for greater confidence among them.
It has played a positive role in promoting regional and global
economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing and summarizing the development path of APEC and
further clarifying its development directions, the Chinese foreign
minister noted that first and foremost, APEC must continue to
focus on economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"APEC is a forum for economic cooperation created in response
to the development needs of the Asia-Pacific region and
development trends of global economy. Its purpose is to 'reduce
economic disparities among members and achieve common prosperity.'
The past 10 years' experience is a proof that one of the most
fundamental causes for the steady development and progress
achieved by APEC is the commitment of all the members to the
fundamental objective of economic cooperation by proceeding from
their common economic interests.
</P>
<P>
"At present the changing situation has required us to readjust
priorities within the framework of economic cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said China supports any new
element in the content of cooperation as long as it directly bears
on economic development and helps deepen the APEC community
spirit, promote cooperation and facilitate the common development
of all the member economies.
</P>
<P>
"That's why we are not in favor of APEC discussion of
political, security and social and other sensitive or
controversial issues, for such discussion will only result in
differences and adversely affect cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"This does not serve the common interests of APEC members, nor
does it conform to the original intention for the establishment of
APEC," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Tang said, APEC shall stick to its cooperation
approach suited to this region. "After 10 years of exploration,
APEC has formed an APEC approach that recognizes diversity,
stresses flexibility and adheres to consensus, voluntarism and
gradual progress," he added.
</P>
<P>
The APEC approach provides the only feasible cooperation model
for this region and it is also of great immediate importance for
forging worldwide fair, equitable and reasonable new international
economic ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Tang added, APEC shall continue to focus on
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Paralleled development of trade and investment liberalization
and economic and technological cooperation is an important
innovation of APEC and also a major feature that distinguishes
APEC from other organizations of economic cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
While calling for more attention to developing economies, he
said that with the ever closer interdependence among the
economies, "development of only a few countries won't lead to a
sustained and stable growth of world economy as a whole."
</P>
<P>
"To ensure a balanced development of APEC, it is utterly
important to reverse the situation in which APEC's economic and
technological cooperation lags behind trade and investment
liberalization," tang stressed.

<HEADLINE> China's Oil Sector Surges Ahead (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since China adopted the reform and opening-up policy in 1978,
the country's oil sector has soared to a new level. Between 1978
and 1998, China invested 258.7 billion yuan to develop its oil and
gas industry, as compared to 7.16 billion yuan between 1949 and
1978. Investment in oil and gas exploration has increased at an
annual average 11.1 percent over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the Daqing Oilfield has
maintained an annual output of more than 50 million tons for 24
consecutive years. Other newly-developed oilfields such as Tarim
and Turpan-Hami have also shown steady growth in the past 20 years,
providing additional oil and gas reserves topping one billion tons
and one trillion cu m, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, long-distance gas pipelines linking Beijing, Xi'an,
Sichuan and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region have emerged, which
ensures gas supply in energy-short cities.
</P>
<P>
China has dramatically readjusted its oil industrial system
since it adopted the reform and opening policy, such as the
introduction of the public bidding system in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China reshaped its oil and petrochemical industry by
reorganizing two major group enterprises, the CNPC and Sinopec, in
a bid to integrate upstream with downstream production.
</P>
<P>
CNPC has so far signed 47 contracts with 44 overseas oil
companies, attracting foreign investment worth more than one
billion U.S. dollars. Moreover, the China National Offshore Oil
Corp (CNOOC) has signed more than 130 exploration contracts with
70 foreign oil companies from 18 countries and regions, absorbing
nearly 7 billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Through Sino-foreign cooperation, China has drilled around 400
oil wells and found over 100 oil-bearing structures in its coastal
waters.
</P>
<P>
More significantly, China has successfully squeezed into the
international oil markets amid fierce competition, and has
undertaken a large group of oil projects in Sudan, Venezuela,
Kazakhstan, Peru and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rebound, Dollar Falls in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rebounded in Tokyo
Thursday following the announcement of an unexpected rise in Japan
's gross domestic product (GDP) for the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged 36.18 points, or 0.21
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 17,677.56.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, added 5.05 points or 0.34 percent to 1,507.
62.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Economic Planning Agency said before the market opened
that the GDP grew a real 0.2 percent in the second quarter from
the previous one, marking its second straight quarterly rise.
</P>
<P>
Japan's private economic institutions had predicted a slight
contraction in the GDP.
</P>
<P>
After hitting the day's high of 17,859.71 in the early morning
trading, the key Nikkei index lost its upward momentum, as the yen
's upturn against the U.S. dollar, stirred by the strong GDP data,
made investors hesitant to buy stocks further, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section came to 473.99 million shares,
slightly down from 484.62 million shares Thursday.
</P>
<P>
NEC Corp. was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers led gainers
586 to 564 despite the overall gain in Nikkei index, with 185
issues ending unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar fell to the 108
yen level, pressured by heavy selling after the release of the GDP
data.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Belgium Demands Pinochet's Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Belgium has joined Spain,
France and Switzerland in demanding the extradition of former
Chilean president Gen. Augusto Pinochet for alleged torture
against Belgian citizens during his rule of Chile beginning in the
1970s, a Spanish court said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish National Court said the International Police (
Interpol) has informed it of the extradition request of a Belgian
procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, is under 24-hour guard at a house southwest of
London since his arrest by British police on October 16 last year
when he went to London to treat illness. His arrest was requested
by Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon, who wants to try the former
Chilean leader for various alleged crimes committed during his
rule.
</P>
<P>
In line with Garzon's charges, the Spanish government demanded
that the British government hand over Pinochet for trials in Spain.
France and Switzerland followed suit, requiring the extradition of
Pinochet on similar charges.
</P>
<P>
But Chile is strongly opposed to these extradition requests,
maintaining that such efforts would undermine its sovereignty. The
Chilean government has asked these countries to allow Pinochet to
return home.
</P>
<P>
After failing to solve the Pinochet issue through diplomatic
channels, the Chilean government decided to seek an international
arbitrage.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes has said that Spain would
elaborate on its stance on the issue in the days to come.

<HEADLINE> Oman GDP to Grow by 2.4 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Omani official has
predicted the country's Gross Domestic Product will grow by 2.4
percent in 1999 thanks to higher oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices in the world market have exceeded Oman government's
projections and therefore, the prospect for the country's economy
has tangibly improved, said Mohammed Bin Nasser Al Khusaibi,
secretary-general of the Omani National Economy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent upswing in oil prices has reflected
positively on Oman's economy, allowing a re-balancing of the
general financial situation, the Dubai-based Khaleej Times
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He expected a noticeable drop in the budget deficit in view of
the price hikes. Nearly 70 percent of the Oman government's
revenues come from oil export.
</P>
<P>
But he also stressed the continuation of the current situation
depends on oil producers' commitment to production cuts and
improvement in world economy.
</P>
<P>
Oman's real budget deficit swelled to 975 million U.S dollars
in 1998 from a 766 million dollars forecast.
</P>
<P>
In January, Oman issued its 1999 budget, forecasting revenues
at 3.96 billion dollars and spending at 5.6 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Needs $30 Bln to Revive Economy, Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 9 (Xinhua) - Nigerian economy needs about 30
billion U. S. dollars every year in the coming five years to
revive, diversify and significantly reduce its heavy dependence on
imports.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Dotun Philips, a renowned economist in the west African
country, said in Lagos Wednesday that for best, "crude oil trade
will probably produce only about 10 billion dollars out of this
requirement, leaving an annual resource gap of about 20 billion
dollars."
</P>
<P>
The professor told the Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce
that ordinarily, the gap ought to "be filled mainly through
international flows from non-crude oil trade, international trade,
investment and loans."
</P>
<P>
But the international flows "have for long proved insignificant
and elusive and are most likely to remain so," The Guardian
newspaper Thursday quoted the economist as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country's non-oil exports have never yielded
up to 500 million dollars in any given year.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the declining international aid from donor
countries, unattractiveness to foreign investors and huge external
debt, Philips said that the federal government needs to devote far
much more effort to significantly revamping and improving the
internal conditions of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, yearly foreign direct investment in
Nigeria had hardly exceeded 1.5 billion dollars while portfolio
investment was most insignificant "with only a 50.5-million-dollar
inflow through the Nigerian Stock Exchange in 1998, the highest
volume ever."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of external debt, Philips said the country should
not expect any debt relief in the foreseeable future as Nigeria is
perceived as a rich country which, but for mismanagement, "can and
should fully repay its external debt".
</P>
<P>
He also urged the government to beef up its efforts to chase
elusive debt relief.

He said at a press conference that China has themed next year's
tourism campaign "New Millennium China 2000."
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 31, the ten cities will lead a series of gala events to
welcome the 21st century, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Harbin Mayor Cao Guangliang said that his city will spend 33
million yuan to build a snow and ice wonderland which will cover
280,000 sq meters -- ten times larger than the famous Zhaolin Ice
Lantern Park in the city.
</P>
<P>
The site will require 70,000 cubic meters of ice and 130,000
cubic meters of snow. Some 10,000 ice and snow sculptures will be
on display.
</P>
<P>
The area will be divided into four parts: Jubilee Square,
Sounds of the Century, Adventure Paradise and Cartoon World.
</P>
<P>
During the eight-week festival, various cultural and commercial
activities will be held, including the naming of 200 Snow Whites
and Millennium Ice Beauties, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
Harbin's annual snow and ice festival has become one of the

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Media Seeks to Avoid Covering News on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's National Audiovisual
Media Council has organized a meeting with the country's major
media to discuss means to avoid covering events attended or
sponsored by Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held Wednesday, was attended by representatives of
the country's all audiovisual media, including seven TV stations
and five radio stations, the Daily Star reported Thursday
</P>
<P>
Council President Nasser Qandil said after the meeting that
"we reached full agreement regarding the caution shown by these
media outlets in their eschewing traps set by Israel."
</P>
<P>
He added that Israeli policy consisted of attempting to cast
doubts on the country's rejection of any form of contact with the
enemy.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is officially at war with Israel which has carved out a
border strip in south Lebanon as security zone.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government prohibits its citizens from contacting
Israel and otherwise they will face the strict penalty, including
the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the council stirred a controversy when it
recommended closing LBCI TV station, one of the most popular TV
stations in the Middle East, for three days after its
correspondent in Jordan covered an event attended by Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
But after the station did not air the report and promised to
take disciplinary action against the correspondent, the cabinet
rejected the recommendation and instead warned stations against
breaking the boycott of Israel.

<HEADLINE> China Favors Settling Trade Disputes Through Consultation: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 9 (Xinhua) - China on Thursday
called on Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members to
settle their trade disputes through consultation and refrain from
resorting to means like anti-dumping measures and trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech at the two-day 11th APEC ministerial
meeting which opened here Thursday, Shi Guangsheng, minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation of China, said that
although APEC has made important progress in the area of trade and
investment for the past decade, there still exist in the
Asia-Pacific region various discriminatory barriers to trade.
</P>
<P>
Citing examples like misuse of anti-dumping measures,
quantitative restrictions on products from developing members, and
even trade sanctions or threat of trade sanctions, Shi stressed
that "all these run counter to the APEC spirit of consultation and
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"As we are to embrace the new millennium," he said, "we will
present the new century our best gift if we can reach a consensus
and state that APEC members will settle trade disputes through
consultations, eliminate discriminatory technical barriers,
prevent the misuse of anti-dumping measures and do away with trade
sanctions."
</P>
<P>
As to the Individual Action Plan (IAP) and Collective Action
Plan (CAP) processes, Shi said that China always believes that IAP
is the primary mechanism towards realizing the APEC objective of
trade and investment liberalization.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, experience in the last couple of years also
proves that to push forward the APEC process of trade and
investment liberalization and facilitation through both IAP and
CAP is a workable approach, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the future, APEC should focus its attention on
the implementation of existing CAP while continuing to value the
role of IAP as the main channel.

<HEADLINE> China's "Silver Hair" Consumer Market Shows Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- More should be done to develop
consumer opportunities for the elderly, as the goods and services
designed for "silver hairs" aren't up to speed with China's
rapidly growing senior population, experts here said today.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar held here for developing consumer goods for the
elderly, the experts pointed out that China's population of people
60 or older has exceeded 120 million and will reach 450 million by
the middle of next century, with one of every four Chinese being
elderly.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that tremendous commercial potential exists for
developing goods for seniors.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenfan of the China National Committee on Aging (CNCA)
said he is optimistic about the industry that caters to China's
elderly, explaining that their numbers are large, they have a
steadily growing income, and they represent various levels of
consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the total sum of retirement pension, re-
employment income and estovers of Chinese seniors will reach 400
billion yuan in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The experts also noted that the some industries clearly haven't
paid enough attention to this commercial opportunity. For example,
Beijing currently has just 300 senior citizen's homes, enough for
only 10,000 people, while the city has 1.7 million elderly.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Shanghai also show that among the city's
citizens who traveled last year, less than five percent were over
65. Seniors there have complained that available travel routes don
't match their habits and interests.
</P>
<P>
The experts called on business people to provide goods and
services that are truly wanted by the elderly.

<HEADLINE> New WTO Negotiations Should Accommodate Developing Members' Interests: Chinese Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 9 (Xinhua) - The new round of
World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations scheduled to start
later this year should give full consideration to the requests and
interests of its developing members, a senior Chinese official
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 11th APEC ministerial meeting, Shi Guangsheng,
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation of China, said
that the negotiations should be more focused on practical,
effective and balanced implementation of various agreements
already reached during the Uruguay Round, particularly those
catering to the needs of developing economies.
</P>
<P>
As to the new agendas, he added, the opinions and suggestions
of all parties, especially those of the vast number of developing
economies should be listened to.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister noted that the requests and interests of
developing economies -- the bulk of WTO membership -- should be
seriously taken into account throughout the negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day, the results of the negotiations should
help to build a more open and equitable multilateral trading
system and play a more positive role in promoting economic
development of all members, instead of just a few," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Only in this way can the new round of WTO negotiations win
active support and full participation of the large number of
developing economies, effectively push for continuous development
of global trade and economy, improve the welfare of more people
and succeed in real sense, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
As to APEC's possible contributions to the WTO, Shi noted that
APEC has already made important contributions to the multilateral
trading system through its work in the trade and investment fields
in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
He said the forum will make another important contribution to
WTO if it presents a series of constructive proposals and
recommendations on the basis of consensus for the new round of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, he reminded APEC members that contribution to WTO is
only one aspect of APEC's integrated efforts to promote economic
stability and development of its members in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Being a major trading nation and destination of foreign direct
investment in the world, China is closely watching the progress of
the new round of negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a global organization dealing with multilateral trade
relations, the WTO will lack representation and universality
without the participation of large trading nations like China, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed the hope that China could participate in
the new round of negotiations as a full member of WTO so as to
make its due contributions to the development of world trade and
global economy.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Papua New Guinean FMs Meet on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan met here Thursday with his Papua New Guinean
counterpart Michael Somare on relations between their two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tang told Somare that China always attaches
great importance to its relations with Papua New Guinea and views
the country as a major cooperation partner in the South Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, relations between the two countries took an
unexpected turn, but the Papua New Guinean government led by Prime
Minister Mekere Morauta swiftly made a wise decision by
reaffirming that the country would continue to pursue the
One-China policy.
</P>
<P>
"China highly appreciates and welcomes this decision, which has
eliminated an obstacle against the further development of
relations between China and Papua New Guinea," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proven that the political attempt of the Taiwanese
authorities to lure South Pacific countries with money to develop
so- called official relations with Taiwan will eventually be seen
through by the South Pacific people, the Chinese foreign minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese government has always worked for
the development of long-term friendly and mutually beneficial
relations between China and Papua New Guinea, and will continue to
make unswerving efforts for the development of such relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Somare said that Papua New
Guinea pursues the One-China policy, which is not only an
established policy of the Papua New Guinean government, but also a
firm commitment of the Morauta government.
</P>
<P>
He said that presently, relations between China and Papua New
Guinea are well established and that his country will make
continued efforts for further expanding friendly relations of
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Tang also met with Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov to discuss bilateral relations and exchange views on
international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers are in Auckland to attend a ministerial
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum that
opened earlier Thursday in preparation for the September 12-13 7th
informal meeting of APEC leaders.

ZHENGZHOU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China's largest nylon-66
salts producer in the city of Pingdingshan in Henan Province is
expected to put an end to China's dependence on nylon-66 salts
imports.
</P>
<P>
The material is used for producing chemical fibers and plastics
and widely used for synthetic fibers used for knitwear, tires, and
in machinery and electric industries.
</P>
<P>
Work on the nylon salts plant began in 1994 and was completed
this March at a cost of 2.68 billion yuan (322 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The plant is equipped with technology from Japan's Asahi
Engineering Co. Ltd. and Italy's Noy Vallesina Engineering S.P.A..
It has a production capacity of 65,000 tons of nylon-66 salts
annually.
</P>
<P>
By July, it had produced 28,000 tons of nylon-66 salts.
</P>
<P>
By using the product, China Shenma Group, the nylon-66 salts
project sponsor, has produced automobile tire cloth and sold it to
domestic and overseas motor works.

<P>
LUSAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- About 40 percent of Zambian
rural adult women are illiterate, Zambian Minister of Community
Development Dawson Lupunga has said.
</P>
<P>
Zambian newspaper, The Post, Thursday quoted the minister as
saying that democracy is compromised when the majority in the
country are illiterate.
</P>
<P>
Lupunga said at a function Wednesday marking the International
Literacy Day, that the situation has contributed to social
economic development being impeded because the most productive
people are illiterate.
</P>
<P>
He said despite the government's rigorous campaign for basic
education to every child, especially the girl child, more has to
be done to reduce illiteracy among the most affected people.
</P>
<P>
Lupunga said the current illiteracy rate of 40 percent should
be reduced to 12 percent by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The key to eradicating poverty is political and national with
all the citizens making "each one teach one a reality," he said.

HONG KONG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- No Y2K incidents have been
reported so far in Hong Kong, said the Central Coordinating Center
(CCC) for monitoring the computer bug problem during the rollover
to September 9, which is one of the Y2K critical dates, early
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government
and various essential service sectors went on full alert during
the rollover.
</P>
<P>
The CCC, which was activated at 10 p.m. Wednesday, has been set
up to monitor the situation across Hong Kong during the rollover
to 9 September, to coordinate cross-sector emergency responses to
Y2K-induced incidents, as well as to collect, collate and
disseminate information.
</P>
<P>
It is manned by officers from a number of concerned bureaus and
departments, including the Information Technology and Broadcasting
Bureau, Security Bureau, Information Technology Services
Department, Office of the Telecommunications Authority and
Electrical and Mechanical Services Department.
</P>
<P>
To coincide with the activation of the CCC, the 13 sector-wide
coordinating centers covering various essential services have also
come into operation.
</P>
<P>
The sectors are food supply, transport, financial services,
public order, fire and emergency services, environment, aviation,
public health, telecommunication, port management, energy supply,
immigration and broadcasting.

These sector-wide centers are responsible for coordinating
emergency responses to Y2K-induced incidents among different
departments/organizations within their respective sectors.
</P>
<P>
They maintain close liaison with the CCC and report to it on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
This monitoring arrangement has been operating smoothly, and so
far no Y2K incidents have been reported, said Jessie Ting, deputy
secretary for information technology and broadcasting who is also
the controller of the CCC.
</P>
<P>
"Both the government and the essential services providers have
made tremendous efforts to solve the Y2K problem. We have also
drawn up contingency arrangements to ensure a prompt response to
any unforeseen Y2K-induced incidents," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The risk that Hong Kong will be adversely affected by the Y2K
problem on the rollover to 9 September is very minimal," Ting said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the experience gained from the operation of the
CCC and the 13 sector-wide coordinating centers on this occasion
would help the government and all concerned to set up an effective
monitoring and coordinating mechanism during the rollover to the
new millennium.

<HEADLINE> Obuchi, 2 Others File Candidacies for Presidency of Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and two senior politicians of Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) filed their candidacies Thursday for the
party's upcoming presidential race, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The two candidates who will vie for a two-year term at the LDP'
s top post with Obuchi are former LDP Secretary General Koichi
Kato and former party policy chief Taku Yamasaki.
</P>
<P>
The winner of the leadership race, which will be held on
September 21, will become Japan's prime minister as the LDP has a
majority in the powerful House of Representatives (lower house).
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, who is serving out the remainder of the term of his
predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto, looks certain to win his first
full two-year term since he has support of two-thirds of the party
's 371 lawmakers. His current tenure as LDP leader ends September
30
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to lead in votes to be cast by LDP members
nationwide. A total of 2.91 million party members are eligible to
participate in a mail-in vote, with 10,000 votes equivalent to one
vote by a legislator.
</P>
<P>
Kato and Yamasaki run in the race with the aim to position
themselves as possible successors to Obuchi. Kato leads the party'
s second largest faction with 70 Diet (parliament) members, while
Yamasaki heads a faction with 31 Diet members.
</P>
<P>
One focus of the election campaign is on a plan to expand the
current coalition government between the LDP and the Liberal Party
to include the New Komeito party, Japan's second largest
opposition party. Obuchi's two rivals are critical of the proposed
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Other issues include ways to achieve economic recovery and
whether to revise Japan's constitution.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China has established a DNA
data bank for tracking and identifying criminals, an official from
the Ministry of Justice announced today.
</P>
<P>
The DNA collection program was headed by the Shanghai-based
Institute of Forensic Science under the Ministry of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Forensic experts point out that the data bank marks a great
step forward for China's use of technology in criminal
investigation and identification.
</P>
<P>
With the help of computers, police will be able to compare DNA
extracted from hair or blood left at crime scenes with the DNA
information from criminals that has been stored. If the suspect is
a repeat offender, police may solve the case more quickly.
</P>
<P>
The repetition of DNA code in more than one person is
extraordinarily rare. Only twins of the same ovum, or the donor
and benefactor of a marrow transplant, may share similar DNA codes.
</P>
<P>
The ministry official also said that this first DNA data bank
will pave the way for a uniform DNA network throughout China.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Future Chief Strives for Steady Power Transfer (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief
executive-designate of the Macao Special Administrative Region (
SAR), has pledged that he will go all out to ensure a smooth power
transfer in Macao and the region's better development.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the transfer of power on December 20 this year
are now well under way and the leading officials of the future SAR
have started work, he said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of seven principal officials of the SAR
government and the SAR's procurator-general by China's State
Council has not only paved the way for building the SAR, but also
demonstrated the trust of the central people's government that the
Macao people can administer Macao well, Edmund Ho said.
</P>
<P>
"With this trust, work for Macao's future will definitely go
smoothly and the newly appointed principal officials and I are all
confident about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, he
said, an increasing number of Macao people began to take leading
positions in the government, legislature and judiciary of Macao,
and they have accumulated relative experience in their work.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he noted that only a few Macao residents of
Chinese origin were able to take senior positions in the Macao
government. The insufficient work experience of the future SAR's
policy-makers will make it difficult in the running of the SAR
government, he added.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Large-Scale Water Exploration in Ortos Basin (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese government is set
to launch a large-scale water-location project in the Ortos Basin
in a bid to hasten development in the country's arid northwest
region.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Land and Resources has decided to readjust
water exploration in the area region and focus its efforts on the
basin of Ortos, sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
From this year to 2002, the ministry is to spend a total of 80
million yuan (about 9.6 million U.S. dollars) on the stock-taking
of underground water resources in the basin, Xinhua has learned.
</P>
<P>
The basin, situated in the east of China's northwest region,
covers 280,000 square kilometers. It extends through parts or the
whole of five provinces and autonomous regions, Shaanxi, Gangsu,
Ningxia, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The area is rich in coal, oil, natural gas and other natural
resources, and its coal reserves account for over half of China's
total.
</P>
<P>
"It is pivotal to the development of our country's northwest
region," an official from the Ministry of Land and Resources said
of the basin.
</P>
<P>
Its economy is relatively strong compared with other parts of
the region, and its population represents over 60 percent of the
region's total.
</P>
<P>
However, limited precipitation and high rate of evaporation
make it the lowest in the country in terms of per capita water
resources.
</P>
<P>
As a result, "the economic and social development in Ortos has
been seriously handicapped," the official commented.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has decided to enhance exploration in the basin so
as to gain a clearer picture of its underground water resources
and volumes that can be used in the long run.

"With the trust of the central people's government as well as
the support from local residents, the SAR will surely overcome the
difficulty as the senior officials of the SAR are all young and
well educated," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the leading officials, their core task at present is to
ensure a smooth transfer of power and the realization of the
principle of "one country, two systems," "Macao people governing
Macao" and a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that various problems left over from the Portuguese
colonial rule and the impact of the Asian financial crisis are all
grave challenges for the Macao SAR and its government. The current
problems in Macao are focused on the improvement of public
security and better economic performance.
</P>
<P>
"The problems will not be resolved in a short period of time,
nor Macao's long-term development can be achieved with a single
day's effort," he said, adding "What we need is to work in a down-
to-earth manner, and with a long-term strategy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Edmund Ho expressed his confidence that Macao's
future will be brighter. "As chief executive of the future Macao
SAR, I'm well aware of the weight of tasks on my shoulders, as
well as the strong backing power of the motherland and the Macao
citizens."

CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- The Egyptian-Jordanian follow-up committee will hold a
two-day meeting in Cairo Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will discuss bilateral cooperation in agriculture,
industry, electricity, energy, oil, transport, tourism and
education.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian illiteracy has dropped to this year's 33.1 percent
from 76 percent in 1966, Egyptian Education Minister Aussein Kamel
Bahaeddin. And some 10,000 schools have been built over the past
six years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Farid Salim Kadwani, the most flagrant terrorist leader in
Upper Egypt, who led the military wing, has been killed.
</P>
<P>
He committed over 20 terrorist attacks in different places of
Upper Egypt, which caused casualties of civilians and policemen.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa held a flurry of
meetings late on Tuesday night to coordinate efforts regarding an
Egyptian-Libyan initiative, which calls for peace talks and
national reconciliation between Sudanese government and the south
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old civil war and the ensuing famine have claimed
nearly 2 million lives in the poor African country.

<P>
In the meantime, sections with rich underground water will also
be marked as sites for the future development.
</P>
<P>
"This will have a major impact on the framing and
implementation of our country's overall plans of speeded-up
development in the northwest," the official noted.
</P>
<P>
The Ortos is a sedimentary basin formed in the Mesozoic Era.
Previous explorations have indicated that rich, high-quality water
exists under the surface of the basin.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the basin holds a total of 24.5 billion
cubic meters of underground water a year, of which 16.3 billion
cubic meters can be used.
</P>
<P>
But it's not easy to tap the potentially huge bodies of water
underground, since the basin's structure is quite complicated and
its water distribution systems are still unknown.
</P>
<P>
Only when sections with rich underground water have been
located can there be an economic basis for large-scale pumping up
and development, the experts noted.
</P>
<P>
To speed up water-location in the basin, the ministry convened
a meeting of hydrogeologists from Shaanxi and other northwest
provinces in Yinchuan, capital of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, hydrogeologists, along with officials from
the five provinces and regions, reviewed the successes and
failures of water exploration over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
They concluded that more effort should be focused on major
projects, such as the Ortos basin.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Enact Anti-Corruption Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A comprehensive
anti-corruption bill will be enacted in Kenya to deal with the
menace more effectively, Chairman of the Parliamentary Select
Committee on Corruption, Musikari Kombo, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The current bill was defective and narrow and needed to be
rectified to cover more broadly the issue of corruption, Kombo
said in Mombasa, a port city in southeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his committee was formed last year by parliament
to study and investigate the causes, nature, extent and impact of
corruption in the east African country with a view of seeking
remedial measures.
</P>
<P>
The committee's term of reference included identification of
key perpetrators and beneficiaries of corruption and to recommend
immediate effective measure to be taken against such individuals
involved in corruption and recover public property, Kombo said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times newspaper Thursday quoted the chairman as saying
that his committee is to enact the bill to provide for stiff
penalties on all corruption related offences.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his satisfaction that the majority of Kenyans were
aware of the existence of corruption, saying that for the vice to
be eradicated, all Kenyans must participate in the fight against
it.
</P>
<P>
Due to rampant corruption and poor governance in the country,
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suspended a loan package
totalling 205 million U.S. dollars to Kenya in July, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Stresses Economic Cooperation Among APEC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan Thursday called on members of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to strengthen economic
cooperation and build a favorable macro environment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 11th APEC Ministerial Meeting, which began
Thursday in Auckland, the biggest city of New Zealand, Tang said
that "at this time last year when the Asian financial crisis was
still ravaging the Asia-Pacific region, all of us worried about
the economic prospects of this region. But today we are very much
relieved to see a gratifying momentum for economic recovery
emerging in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"APEC member economies affected by the crisis are gradually
bottoming out and beginning to look up. The foreign exchange and
stock markets in the region are being stabilized.
</P>
<P>
"This is a hard-won situation that has come as a result of both
the vigorous efforts by the crisis-affected members in their
reform and restructuring and the support from the region and the
international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
But, the Chinese foreign minister warned that APEC members
should not be overoptimistic about that at this point as economic
recovery in Asia has just started, the root causes for some
ingrained problems in the crisis-affected economies are yet to be
resolved, the global economic environment is not very stable and
trade protectionism has been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, to strengthen economic cooperation, to build a
favorable macro environment and to reinforce the recovery results
are still an assiduous task confronting all of us," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted the Asian financial crisis has caused great
difficulties to China's economy as well. "Despite the enormous
pressures, the Chinese government has, bearing in mind the greater
interests of this region, adopted necessary measures, overcome
various difficulties and successfully maintained a relatively high
economic growth rate, thus making its due contribution to the
economic recovery in the region."
</P>
<P>
At present, he continued, China's economy is still faced with
such difficulties as slack domestic demand, sluggish investment
and declining export.
</P>
<P>
"In response to these adverse factors, the Chinese government
has decided to further improve all-round macro-control of the
economy and stick to a proactive fiscal and monetary policy to
pull up economic growth. Meanwhile, we will continue to deepen the
reform, open wider to the outside world and step up international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that with our hard work, China will realize a
sustained, rapid and sound development of its economy and
contribute more to the economic recovery and development in Asia,"
Tang said.

HARARE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will set up a national
housing trust and a housing finance bank to relax the country's
housing shortage.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Local Government and National Housing John Nkomo
said, in Harare when presenting a draft housing policy, that
housing should be enshrined in the constitution as a human rights.
</P>

The trust would finance housing development by both private and
public sectors, monitor and evaluate the performance of the

stake-holders on trends in the sector.
</P>
<P>
It would be supported by the proposed bank, which would act as
a vehicle of mobilizing funds from individual savings and loans,
pension funds and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The bank would be used as a springboard for private sector
participation in housing development by financing small-scale
developers and contractors.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's housing backlog currently stands at one million
homes and has been failing to meet an annual demand for 250,000
houses and flats.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Annual Inflation Jumps to 6.9% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's overall year-on-year
inflation jumped to 6.9 percent in the 12 months to August fuelled
by a rise in food prices and a depreciating currency, according to
the Central Bank of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Underlying year-on-year inflation, which the central bank
targets at 5 percent or below, climbed to 5.9 percent in August
compared to 4.9 percent in July, the East African Standard
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Assistant chief economist of the central bank, Boniface Masua
said that a sharp increase in food and fuel prices had put heavy
pressure on inflation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the rise in food prices is linked to a shortage
in maize, Kenya's staple food commodity, after poor seasonal long
rains.
</P>
<P>
Masua also attributed the rise in inflation to the fall in the
shilling value over the month. The shilling lost 1.42 percent in
August and had fallen to around 75.76 against the U.S. dollar from
just 61 in January.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that it has been the government's desire to
control the annual inflation rate to single digit level, but sharp
depreciation of the shilling, soaring petroleum prices and surging
interest rates now threaten the set objective.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urged to Intensify Copyright Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government must
provide a strong legal foundation of copyright and other
intellectual property protection to develop its information
technology (IT) industry, an expert said Thursday here during a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance
(BSA), commended the Philippine government's efforts to protect
intellectual property rights and combat software piracy.
</P>
<P>
He said these efforts have contributed towards the reduction of
the software piracy rate in the Philippines in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
However, Holleyman said that the piracy rate was still high and
he urged the government to further intensify its efforts.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the entire software industry is built upon the
foundation of copyright and other intellectual property
protection.
</P>
<P>
"This foundation is the very incentive for developing software
and it provides a market-driven reward for successful products,"
Holleyman said.
</P>
<P>
The BSA represents the world's leading software developers and
educates computer users on software piracy in more than 60
countries.
</P>
<P>
Holleyman announced that the BSA and the Philippine Software
Association will join hands to promote the growth of the
Philippine software industry and to work together in tackling
intellectual piracy issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Holleyman also emphasized the importance of
ratifying and implementing the new World Intellectual Property
Organization Copyright Treaty adopted by the international
community in December 1996.

<HEADLINE> Israel Releases 200 Palestinian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel released 200
Palestinian political prisoners early Thursday morning as promised
in a new peace deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under a revised agreement for the Wye Accord signed last Sunday
in Egyptian Red Sea resort Sharm El Sheikh, Israel, among other
things, should let go 350 Palestinian political prisoners in two
phases. The second batch of 150 will get freedom on October 8.
</P>
<P>
The move marked the start of the implementation of the new
agreement, which also calls for Israeli troops withdrawal from
another 11 percent of the West Bank by January 20.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the dawn broke Thursday, the prisoners got on buses
outside Israeli prisons in different places, with their hands
still cuffed. They were dropped off in military checkpoints on the
way to Gaza and the West Bank cities of Ramallah and Hebron.
</P>
<P>
A government committee headed by the director-general of the
Justice Ministry approved the list of the prisoners Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 200 released prisoners, some 150 have the record of
killing Palestinians who had cooperated with Israeli security
services, and 17 others assisted in non-fatal attacks against Jews.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted that it not release those who had killed
Israelis or belong to the Islamic militant groups like Hamas and
Jihad.
</P>
<P>
The issue of freeing Palestinian political prisoners had been a
sticking point in Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the
resumption of the implementation of the Wye Accord signed last
October and suspended two months later.
</P>
<P>
The two sides compromised at last with the mediation of
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, which led to the conclusion of the revised
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The release came one day after Israel's Knesset (parliament)
overwhelmingly approved the agreement Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the 23-minister cabinet had given go-ahead
to the implementation of first stage troops pullout from 7 percent
of the West Bank as well as the prisoner release. In the vote, 17
pros and 1 con, with one abstention and four absence.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said the decision to hand
over parts of the biblical land of Israel was not easy, but it was
in Israel's best interest to move toward comprehensive peace with
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Israeli negotiator Gilad Sher has said that the first
redeployment will be carried out on September 13, the 6th
anniversary of the signing of the historic Oslo accords, which
kicked off the Mideast peace process.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Kaifeng, in modern day Henan Province, wants to turn the old
capital city into a modern tourist center in 3 years.
</P>
<P>
A new development plan calls for historic sites in the city, in
central China, to be refurbished and modern tourist facilities to
be built. The city is also planning to build a mock-up of the
Kaifeng of the Song Dynasty (10th-13th century), with work to
start later this year.
</P>
<P>
Three major tourist routes linking Kaifeng with other three
scenic spots will also be opened by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Kaifeng has a history of almost 3,000 years and was one of six
old Chinese capitals. The city has had to be rebuilt several times
because of Yellow River floods.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the number of tourists in the
city was up 160 percent and tourism revenues were up 6-fold from
the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Group in Tibet Changing From Hunting to Agriculture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Dagdain is driving his newly-
bought truck loaded with cargo through the dense forests, but he
can not help searching for signs of animals with his eagle-like
eyes as he did in the past.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old driver was recognized as one of the most
experienced hunters of the Lhoba ethnic group living mainly in the
southeastern part of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Lhoba ethnic group, which has its own spoken language but
no written form, has some 2,700 members and is one of China's
smallest ethnic minority groups.
</P>
<P>
For generations, the Lhoba lived a tribal life in the virgin
forests of Tibet, mostly hunting. They usually got together to
share what they got from the hunt. But very often there was little
left for them because they were forced to turn over the fur, bear
gallbladders, musk, and other parts of the animal to the local
government.
</P>
<P>
The Lhoba respected brave hunters and boys traditionally
started practicing shooting with their parents at the age of seven
or eight. The men were all good hunters and the best was usually
known among villagers. The Lhoba used these primitive production
methods until not long ago.

In 1959, the year Tibet began its democratic reforms, the Lhoba
had a chance to change their lives. With the help of the central
government, they gradually put end to the hunting and moved out of
their thatched-roof cottages and caves and down to valley areas,
where a road was built and power stations set up.
</P>
<P>
Dagdain, like others in the ethnic group, hung up his gun and
bow and arrow, and took to farming.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Group in Tibet Changing From Hunting to Agriculture (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was not smooth sailing for the hunters to change to a more
settled life as farmers at the beginning. Their per-hectare yield
of grain was less than 750 kg, because of their lack of knowledge
and experience. Some of them had to turn to hunting to support
their families.
</P>
<P>
With the increased use of improved seeds, fine fertilizer and
technology, the ethnic group got better returns from agriculture.
The 11 people in Dagdain's family have 1.1 hectares of farmland
and harvest nearly 5,000 kg of grain a year. They also have more
than 40 oxen and cows, providing more than 300 kg of butter a year.
</P>
<P>
To make life better, the family bought two trucks and a
bulldozer to diversify their business. Two of Dagdain's sons are
working in forestry and on civil engineering projects elsewhere in
the region. The family's income reached 50,000 yuan in 1998,
making them one of the richest families around.
</P>
<P>
But, even though, Dagdain is hard-nosed about giving up hunting
and not using his bow and arrows, not to mention the rifles that
brought him money and honor in the past. And he gets wistful when
he sees these items hanging on the wall as decorations.
</P>
<P>
Dagdain is regarded as the last hunter of the ethnic group, but
his life is happy and confident as he now enjoys the modern
conveniences like his new color TV, VCD, and the music.

BEIRUT, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Two members of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) were wounded Wednesday night by a
roadside bomb in south Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio
reported Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The two militiamen, one in a serious condition, were hurt when
a roadside bomb blew up their armored car in the Rihan area in the
eastern sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>

The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed

<HEADLINE> New Zealand FM Stresses Importance of Jiang's Coming Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's coming to New Zealand "is of great importance," said New
Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon in a recent interview with
Chinese correspondents.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jiang would come to New Zealand not only for the
upcoming Informal Meeting of Leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, but also for a state visit.
</P>
<P>
"We have never had a president of China in New Zealand before.
We do consider this visit is of great importance, which will
underpin new substance to the bilateral relationship," McKinnon
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president will come to New Zealand's biggest city,
Auckland, to attend the Informal Meeting of APEC Leaders, followed
by his state visit to the country at the invitation of Governor
General Michael Hardie Boys.
</P>
<P>
Several days ago, McKinnon gave an exclusive interview to
correspondents from Xinhua and China's major national
newspapers in his office in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
McKinnon, who has been New Zealand foreign minister for nine
years, said that his country has always had "very comfortable
relationship with the People's Republic of China, which goes back
to early 1970s. We have always had good linkages not only at
political level, but our cultural exchanges, education exchanges,
trade relationship have grown very strongly. New Zealand takes
very seriously the relationships with China. We do maintain the
good relations with China and continue to work out towards it."
</P>
<P>
The minister said he hoped that during Jiang's stay in the
country there will be the recognition of a lot of expertise his
country has in the horticulture, forestry, agriculture, fishery
that can be used in China, either in direct investment or in joint
ventures investment, in technological advancement and
technological transfer.
</P>
<P>
In view of the facts that China is the fifth largest trading
partner of New Zealand, McKinnon said the Chinese market is always
very important to New Zealand-China relationship.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed New Zealand's support for China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO). "We have lobbied for China to join
the WTO. We are satisfied that China has made a lot of changes to
maintain commitment to joining the WTO."
</P>
<P>
McKinnon said that a meeting between Jiang and his U.S.
counterpart Bill Clinton would be "probably the most important
bilateral meeting" of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Sino-American ties will move from delicate to a
stronger relationship," McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, the minister stressed: "New Zealand has
full recognition of one China policy."
</P>
<P>
Stressing China's role in the region, he said that "what I
appreciate is the way that China is very much engaged in the
region and I've seen China changes. When I became foreign minister
in 1990, I've seen changes every year, much more engagement in the
whole region."
</P>
<P>
The minister said New Zealand and China do not always agree on
some issues, but they are prepared to discuss these issues "in a
very non-threatening way."
</P>
<P>
"We talk about issues in order to solve the issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming APEC meeting, McKinnon said the meeting will
discuss issues on trade liberalization, broadening markets and
seeking wider support for APEC.
</P>
<P>
What New Zealand likes to achieve, he said, "is that we can get
a collective view from APEC leaders" on issues discussed.
</P>
<P>
"Remember APEC represents 57% of the world's GDP. APEC is 60%
of the world's travel of goods and services. So APEC has the
capacity to have a lot of impact" on WTO's next round of talks on
global trade, McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
He praised China for its "very positive role" she had played in
APEC and other international organizations.

<P>
URUMQI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kirgiz are members of one
of China's 55 ethnic groups, may still be familiar with their 200,
000-line folk epic "Manass", but their lives have undergone
fundamental changes in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
There are 150,000 Kirgiz, 80 percent of them living in the
Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region. They are one of the ancient nomadic
tribes of northern China and many of them still engage mainly in
animal husbandry and supplement it with farming and dairy products
in the Tianshan Mountains and on the Pamir Plateau.
</P>
<P>
But, at least half of them have left their centuries-old life
of moving from one grazing area to another behind and have built
permanent houses.
</P>
<P>
Their agriculture and animal husbandry have had good results
for 19 years in a row thanks to more modern agricultural
techniques. The prefecture's grain output amounted to 160,000 tons
last year and the annual per-capita income of herdsmen is at least
1,200 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The beautiful scenes and landscapes described in the "Manass"
have become a reality and the vast Gobi has become an immense
forest. The green grass is dotted with sheep and cattle and new
buildings equipped with modern furniture and household appliances
can be seen everywhere.

<HEADLINE> Japan's GDP Rises 0.2 Percent in April-June Period in Real Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's gross domestic product (
GDP) grew 0.2 percent in the April-June period from the previous
quarter in real terms, or an annualized growth of 0.9 percent, the
Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rise marks the second consecutive quarterly increase,
following a revised 2 percent quarter-to-quarter growth or an
annualized expansion of 8.1 percent in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
With the robust second-quarter performance, the agency said,
the Japanese government's target of a 0.5 percent real growth for
the fiscal 1999 is attainable, even if the economy shrinks by 0.5
percent in each of the three remaining quarters of the fiscal year
ending on March 31 next year.
</P>
<P>
The agency attributed the April-June GDP growth primarily to
solid personal consumption, which rose 0.8 percent for the second
consecutive quarterly rise. Personal consumption makes up about 60
percent of Japan's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Another factor was a strong 16.1 percent increase in housing
investment, due to the government's tax cuts for home buyers.
</P>
<P>
Corporate capital spending and public investment, however,
dropped 4 percent from the previous quarter respectively.
</P>
<P>
The domestic-demand component of GDP increased a preliminary 0.
2 percent, while the external-demand component was flat, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the GDP data, EPA chief Taichi Sakaiya said the
Japanese economy is recovering, but added it is too early to feel
at ease over the economy's future.
</P>
<P>
Sakaiya said it is unclear whether the Japanese economy has
bottomed out, but it has recovered from the crisis-like situation.
</P>
<P>
However, Sakaiya said it is premature to relax over the future
course of the economy and the government will take measures to
keep it on a recovery track.
</P>
<P>
GDP measures the value of goods and services produced within a
nation. Real GDP figures are adjusted for inflation and seasonal
variations.

<HEADLINE> Two Drug-Trafficking Groups Tracked Down in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Two groups engaged in drug
trafficking have been arrested in Poland, said Polish police on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lodz city police arrested 18 drug traffickers belonging to a
ring operating between Poland and the Netherlands, which was
believed to be the largest of its kind along the route.
</P>
<P>
The Polish news agency PAP quoted authorities as saying that
the group transported marijuana into Poland and amphetamine into
the Netherlands for three years. Drug sales by them amounted to 35
million zloty (around 9 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ring had a well-organized network in Poland, through which
drugs were sold in bars, universities and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
The arrested could face a sentence of up to 15 years
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
In another case, five youths, including a Dutch, were charged
with drug trafficking and selling in an eastern Polish city. From
them police seized 37 kilograms of drugs, which had a market value
of 240,000 zloty (60,000 dollars).

<HEADLINE> Moscow Apartment Building Blast Toll Rises to 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of people killed in
a huge explosion that ripped through an apartment building in
Moscow early Thursday has risen to 13, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 37 wounded were hospitalized while 150 others are believed
to be still under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
The blast, believed to be caused by gas, destroyed 108
apartments in the building on Guryanova Street at 00:12 local time
(20:12 GMT Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
The explosion killed two people immediately. Four bodies have
been recovered from the debris.
</P>
<P>
Sixty ambulance teams, rescuers and 40 fire-fighting crews were
working at the scene. They had rescued 18 people alive from the
rubble as of 04:00 (00:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has been informed of the
explosion and the country's interior and emergency affairs
ministers were at the scene, Tass quoted government spokesman
Igor Shchyogolev as saying.
</P>
<P>
"A criminal case has been instituted on the fact of the
explosion and investigation has started," Shchyogolev said.
</P>
<P>
Forty residents of the building have been evacuated and
accommodated in the Tula cinema, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether the explosion was
accidental or set off intentionally.
</P>
<P>
On August 31, a bomb went off in a mall under Moscow's Manezh
Square near the Kremlin, injuring 44 people. One of the victims, a
25-year-old Russian woman, died last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The woman and her Lebanese husband in their honeymoon were near
the mall's video game arcade, where an estimated equivalent of 300
grams of TNT went off. Her husband, with burns of over 70 percent
of his body surface, remains in critical condition in the
Sklifosofsky Institute of Intensive Care, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Police are still investigating the explosion, and Islamic
militants related to the breakaway republic of Chechnya were seen
as one of the possible perpetuators of the attack.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officers also discovered leaflets claimed to be
authored by an anti-consumerism group that hails "city guerrilla
warfare" aimed at creating a "revolutionary situation" in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In Russia's southern Dagestan republic, a huge car bomb last
Saturday demolished a five-story residential building inside a
military compound, killing over 60 people and wounding 50.
</P>
<P>
Islamic militants were thought to be behind the blast, which
also badly damaged two nearby buildings and smashed windows
throughout the complex.
</P>
<P>
A second bomb in another car was found and defused Sunday in
the military housing complex.

<HEADLINE> Thai Companies Lag in Business Skills Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Despite the economic crisis,
Thai companies still lack sense of urgency to improve the business
skills of their employees, The Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It will likely take at least two to three years for Thai
companies to catch up to the standards of their counterparts in
this respect in Singapore and Malaysia, the newspaper quoted the
Thai branch of American Management Association (AMA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
AMA, the third largest training and development agency in the
United States, said that Thai firms, especially family-owned
groups, have been paying poor attention to the development of
their employees' skills.
</P>
<P>
To date, only the Thai branches of multinational companies and
Thai firms which have been partly taken over by foreign firms are
attentive to this issue, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The business skills of an average Thai company employee is
three to five years behind those of a Singaporean, working in the
same position, and two or three years behind a Malaysian, the
report said.

<P>
URUMQI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- New relations among the ethnic
groups of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have
developed over the past 50 years, according to Abul'ahat Abdurixit,
chairman of the regional people's government.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic groups are involved in mutual development and shared
prosperity with help from successful Communist Party policies, he
told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has 47 ethnic groups, 13 of which have lived in the
region for generations. Since the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang
in 1949, ethnic minorities have rid themselves of the oppression
of reactionary rulers and enjoy equality. In 1953, the first batch
of townships governed by ethnic groups were set up and five ethnic
minority prefectures and counties were established the following
year. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was founded on October
1, 1955 by the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The region opened a new chapter in Xinjiang's developmental
history and the past five decades have been the fastest period of
development, Abul'ahat Abdurixit says.
</P>
<P>
The number of cadres from ethnic groups has grown from some 3,
000 in the early 1950s to 320,000. The autonomous region's Ninth
People's Congress has 542 deputies, 357 of whom are from ethnic
minorities.

<P>
The autonomous regional government places great stress on
national unity and uses education about nationhood and patriotism
to maintain regional stability, equality and unity, Abul'ahat
Abdurixit says. Every May a national unity education day is
designated.
</P>
<P>
At present, the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang have mutual
trust, respect, and support, and learn from each other. The idea
that one can not live without the help of others has taken root
here, he adds.
</P>
<P>
The people of the autonomous region love the Communist Party
and socialism, safeguard national unity, oppose divisiveness, and
cooperate fully to contribute to social stability and the
prosperity of all ethnic groups, he says.
</P>
<P>
This unity has paved the way to economic growth and the region
has an economic system with agriculture as the foundation and
industry as a mighty pillar. It is now the largest cotton producer
and a leading petrochemical center in the country.
</P>
<P>
With support and assistance from the central government, there
have been a great number of key infrastructure projects in
Xinjiang to provide a solid base for 21st century development.

<HEADLINE> China-U.S. Summit to Improve Relations: Chinese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming
meeting between the Chinese and United States presidents will be
of great significance to the improvement of Sino-U.S. relations,
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting over breakfast with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Tang said that more
significantly, the summit meeting will have important and
far-reaching influence on the development of trans-century
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his U.S. counterpart Bill
Clinton will meet on the sidelines of the 7th informal meeting of
leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
scheduled for September 12-13 in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
Both Tang and Albright are in Auckland attending the two-day
APEC ministerial meeting that opened Thursday in preparation for
the informal meeting of APEC leaders.
</P>
<P>
Describing his meeting with Albright as "candid, useful and
significant," Tang recalled that the exchange of visit between
Chinese and U.S. heads of state and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's
visit to the United States in April served as a momentum and
opportunity for the development and improvement of relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But a series of ensuing developments, particularly the May 7
U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, "have worsened
Sino- U.S. relations, and the responsibility lies entirely on the
U.S. side," he said.
</P>
<P>
Presently, Sino-U.S. relations are in a crucial stage, with
both challenges and opportunities. As two influential powers in
the world, China and the United States both shoulder important and
common responsibilities for maintaining peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"So, we hope that the U.S. side will take concrete actions to
eliminate obstacles to the restoration, improvement and
development of Sino-U.S. relations," he urged.
</P>
<P>
Whether Sino-U.S. relations can continue to be improved depends
on whether the U.S. side can create favorable conditions for the
improvement of relations by taking concrete actions and steps,
Tang stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Taiwan, Tang said that Lee Teng-hui, leader of
the Taiwan authorities, is going farther and farther on his way of
seeking "independence of Taiwan" by dishing out his "two-states"
theory, damaging the stability of the Taiwan Strait, worsening and
straining relations across the Taiwan Strait and threatening the
peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister stressed that as the issue of
Taiwan concerns China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, the
Chinese people will never allow any attempt of splitting the
motherland to succeed.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the U.S. side, proceeding from the overall
situation of Sino-U.S. relations and abiding by with concrete
actions the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and relevant
commitments it has made, stop making any statement and taking any
act that could encourage Lee Teng-hui's arrogance in selling his
'two-states' theory, explicitly oppose Lee Teng-hui's statement
and acts of splitting China, reduce and finally stop the sale of
weapons to Taiwan, and not provide Taiwan with the Theater Missile
Defense system, relevant techniques, equipment and auxiliary
systems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that "the question of Taiwan is the most sensitive,
most salient and most important issue in Sino-U.S. relations."
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that the United States should have a clear
recognition of the serious nature of this question and the
possible harm it could bring to Sino-U.S. relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that Lee Teng-hui is the biggest troublemaker, the
biggest obstacle and the biggest stumbling block in the way of
development of Sino- U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Albright said that through efforts by the
governments of both countries, there have been some improvements
in U.S.-China relations and that President Clinton expects to once
again meet with President Jiang Zemin to have friendly, frank and
important discussions on bilateral relations and other issues of
common concern.
</P>
<P>
The United States hopes that relations between the two
countries will be fully restored and develop as quickly as
possible in the fundamental interest of the two countries,
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
The United States will continue to pursue its one-China policy
and abide by the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, she said.

KATHMANDU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The 8th Nepal-Bhutan Joint
Ministerial Level Committee (JMLC) meeting over the Bhutanese
refugee crisis will begin here on September 13, The Kathmandu Post
quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to discuss the repatriation of 100,000
Bhutanese refugees living in eastern Nepal after they fled Bhutan
around the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The 7th JMLC meeting held in Kathmandu in 1996 ended in impasse
as Nepal insisted on the repatriation of all refugees, while
Bhutan wanted to take back only those who were forced to flee the
country.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has been seeking cooperation from India in resolving the
refugee crisis, as India handles Bhutan's foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the Foreign Ministry, the Bhutanese
refugee issue is also on the agenda of the Indian Foreign Minister
Jaswant Singh's present visit to Nepal on September 8-11.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok Airways expects annual
revenue to grow by 20 percent over the next five years with sales
totaling five billion baht (131.6 million U.S. dollars) in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post Thursday quoted Bangkok Airways President
Prasert Prasartthongosoth as saying that the airline will not join
any fare-cutting war.
</P>
<P>
The president said Bangkok Airways just wants to be a small
regional airline which offers "reasonable fares".
</P>
<P>
Thailand has four airlines at present, which are Thai Airways
International, Bangkok Airways, PB Air and Angel Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Ranking second among the four, Bangkok Airways has forecast 2.4
billion baht (63.5 million dollars) in total sales revenue this
year, up 18 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
It expects to generate three billion baht (78.9 million

in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the airline said it plans to open new international

<HEADLINE> Jiang Praises Sino-Australian Economic, Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The close trade and economic
ties between China and Australia make a firm foundation for
bilateral relations and have brought enormous benefits to the two
countries as well as the livelihood of the two peoples, visiting
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Today, China and Australia have become each other's important
trade and investment partners," Jiang said Thursday morning during
a meeting with members of the Australia-China Business Council and
representatives of corporations.
</P>
<P>
"Our two economies are highly complementary to each other.
Australia is economically developed and rich in natural resources.
It has an edge in many areas such as energy, transportation,
telecommunications, mining, environmental protection, finance and
insurance," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "All these industries and infrastructure have been
identified by China as its priority areas for development in the
coming years."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Jiang said, there is a great potential for bilateral
cooperation. He hoped the council would continue to play its
unique role and promote and assist the mutually beneficial
cooperation between the business communities of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that people from the Australian economic and trade
community come and visit China and work together with their
Chinese counterparts to create a better future for Sino-Australian
economic cooperation and trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the important objectives of his current visit is to
deepen the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, he continued, economic cooperation and
trade have always been an important topic both in his talks with
Prime Minister John Howard and in his meetings with local leaders
of Australia.
</P>
<P>
"We have shared the view that our bilateral trade and economic
relations have entered a period of sound development and there is
a vast vista for expanding and deepening these ties between us,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he is convinced that so long as the business
communities of the two countries spare no effort in enhancing
cooperation and exploring new fields for cooperation, bilateral
economic cooperation and trade will develop to a new high.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation and trade constitute an important
component of the Sino-Australian relationship, Jiang said, adding
he is glad to see the satisfactory development in the bilateral
economic ties and trade in the past 27 years owing to the joint
efforts by the business communities.
</P>
<P>
The volume of bilateral trade increased from 87 million U.S.
dollars at the establishment of diplomatic ties to a record high
of 5.3 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The two-way investment has kept a momentum of continuous
increase and it has expanded its coverage to include almost all
trades, such as
finance, insurance, metallurgy, construction materials, textile,
electronics, machinery, petroleum, light industry, chemical
industry and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Australia-China Business Council as an important
organization, Jiang praised its "great deal of useful work" for
the enhancement of cooperation and exchanges in the bilateral
economic ties and trade, and its role as an important bridge
linking the two sides.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Jiang is expected to attend a luncheon
hosted jointly by Howard and premiers and chief ministers of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Jiang will proceed to Cairns Friday before ending the state
visit in Australia on September 11.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Argentinean President
Carlos Menem and his Paraguayan counterpart Luis Gonzales Machi
will meet on Thursday in Misiones, Argentina, to discuss bilateral
relations, since Argentina granted Lino Oviedo's asylum last March.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Interior Minister Carlos Corach said on Wednesday
that their countries' bilateral relations should not be affected
by the issue of Oviedo, the failed Paraguayan coup leader and
former army chief accused of instigating Vice-President Argana's
assassination last March. He requested political asylum in
Argentina on March 28.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the differences between Paraguay and
Argentina were caused by Argentina's refusal to extradite Oviedo
last Friday, which resulted in Paraguay dismissing its Foreign
Minister Miguel Abdon Saguier for his failure to obtain the
extradition of Oviedo and his associate former Defense Minister
Argana, who is now living in Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay also recalled, for an indefinite time, its ambassador
to Uruguay and Argentina last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the two countries also held talks

<HEADLINE> Alaska Likely to Be Site of U.S. Missile Defense System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced
Wednesday it has selected the state of Alaska as the most likely
site for its proposed anti-ballistic missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, which was made by U.S. State Department
spokesman James Rubin, came as U.S. and Russian officials started
negotiations in Moscow Wednesday on the terms under which a
missile defense could be established.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the former Soviet Union agreed in the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty not to construct a national
defense system against such missiles. The theory is that leaving
both sides vulnerable would deter nuclear attacks because both
countries would face deadly retaliation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott Wednesday opened
a two-day talk with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov
on reducing nuclear stockpiles and possible changes of the treaty.
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen is also scheduled to visit
Moscow next Monday for talks with Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev on the issue. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is
expected to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in New Zealand next
week.
</P>
<P>
Russia, financially hard pressed to create its own anti-missile
defense, strongly opposes making major changes to the Cold War-era
treaty. It said that an anti-missile defense system in the United
States would tilt the strategic balance and start a new arms race.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Revs Up Research in Controlled Nuclear Fusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China's research in controlled
nuclear fusion is to enter a new stage with the operation of
another nuclear fusion experimental device -- Tokamak HL-2A, which
is being built on the outskirts of Chengdu, the capital city of
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Controlled thermonuclear fusion is thought to be a major energy
source for the future. Unlike fission, which leaves a large amount
of highly radioactive waste, fusion is similar to what happens
when the sun produces light and heat.
</P>
<P>
Tokamak HL-2A was a major overseas cooperation project using
equipment from Germany at the China National Nuclear Corporation's
Southwest Physics Research Institute, China's first and biggest
nuclear fusion experiment center.
</P>
<P>
China started work on controlled nuclear fusion in the 1950s
and developed the Tokamak HL-1 by its own efforts and put it into
operation at the institute in 1984, leading to improvements in
recent years. In 1994, a new system from a modified HL-1
installation was put into use for greater efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Despite the world recognized research results gained with the
help of existing equipment, Chinese researchers of controlled
nuclear fusion decided to build the more advanced Tokamak HL-2A
facility with German equipment, aiming to enhance their role in
the "sphere of nuclear fusion".

<HEADLINE> Davenport, Williams Reach U.S. Open Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Lindsay
Davenport of the United States got a little help from rival Mary
Pierce of France Wednesday to advance into the semifinals of the U.
S. Open.
</P>
<P>
After Pierce squandered two match points in the 10th game of
the third set, rain forced a stoppage of play for just over an
hour. When play resumed, Davenport capitalized on her second match
point when Pierce committed her seventh double fault. Davenport
escaped with a 6-2, 3-6, 7-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Davenport, who extended her U.S. Open winning
streak to 12 matches, will face No. 7 Serena Williams after
Williams rallied for a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory over fourth seed
Monica Seles Wednesday night in an all-American quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
On the men's side, second seed Andre Agassi of the United
States looks to continue his impressive run through the draw
tonight when he won the first set 7-6 (7-3).
</P>
<P>
If Agassi win through, he will take on third seed Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia, who blew a two-set lead but withstood a
record-breaking performance to beat No. 12 Richard Krajicek of the
Netherlands 7-6 (7-0), 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
Davenport broke Pierce four times and fired nine aces as she
improved to 23-3 in her last 26 matches. She is seeking her second
Grand Slam of the year after winning Wimbledon on July 4.
</P>
<P>
"I've had a good time trying to defend this title, whether it
ends Friday or Saturday," Davenport said. "Pulling out a match
like this makes it probably even more special than just winning 6-
3,6-3."
</P>
<P>
Pierce, the fifth seed, committed 44 unforced errors as she
failed in a bid to reach her first U.S. Open semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Agassi has emerged as the favorite to win his second U.S. Open
title after the early withdrawal of top seed Pete Sampras. Ranked
as low as 141st in the world a year ago, Agassi vaulted to No. 1
in July, thanks to winning the French Open and reaching the
Wimbledon final.
</P>
<P>
Williams, who joins older sister Venus in the semifinals, began
the match much the same way she did in the third round Monday by
dropping the first set.
</P>
<P>
But Williams, who recorded five aces in each set, opened the
second with a break and led 4-1. Seles broke in the seventh game,
but Williams broke back for a 5-3 advantage.
</P>
<P>
Seles committed 33 unforced errors against 21 winners, losing
for only the fifth time in 48 U.S. Open matches. A two-time U.S.
Open champion, Seles fell to 0-3 lifetime against Williams.

<HEADLINE> Susi, Alan Resign From Indonesia's Badminton Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Former badminton queen Susi
Susanti and husband Alan Budikusuma have officially resigned as
player and assistant coach from the Indonesian Badminton Center,
The Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) secretary-general
Leo Chandra Wiranata said that PBSI Chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo
approved the resignation request on September 2.
</P>
<P>
In her letter dated September 1, Susi wrote: "I realize that I
am a married woman and I recently delivered my baby, and I think I
will not be able to perform well in badminton tournaments..."
</P>
<P>
Susi, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist and the 1996 Olympic
bronze medalist, married long-time boyfriend Alan in February 1997.
Susi, whose huge collection of titles is only missing the Asian
Games gold,took a break from badminton beginning last year. The 28-
year-old shuttler gave birth to a baby girl Laurencia Averina
Wiratama on April 26, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Susi said that she could not concentrate equally on her family
and career.
</P>
<P>
"First, I considered my age and, second, it's about my family.
If I still play, I won't be able to perform as well as before I
was pregnant. I don't want to embarrass the country with my poor
form. I have committed to only pick between career and family,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Susi said she would not mind being a practice partner for
younger players.
</P>
<P>
"I'll come to the center in Cipayung sometimes. It's also good
for my diet program," she said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
Susi acknowledged that her husband wanted to start his own
business.
</P>
<P>
"I think as the head of the family, he realizes that he has
more responsibility right now. But he still has a good
relationship with his athletes. They still call him to share
experiences," she added.
</P>
<P>
Alan in his letter said: "Due to my limited time at the moment
and my willingness to start my own business, I herewith in this
letter officially resign from my position as a coach at the
badminton center."
</P>
<P>
Alan, also the 1992 Olympics men's singles gold medalist, has
coached at the center for nearly a year. The 31-year-old Alan has
assisted men's singles coach Agus Dwi Santoso to train Hendrawan,
Budi Santoso, Indra Wijaya, Hariyanto Arbi, Ronny Agustinus and
younger brother Johan Hadikusuma.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Case Affects Tourism in Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Tourism in Chile has fallen
by 15 percent so far this year since the detention of former
Chilean military leader Augusto Pinochet in London, said
authorities on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of European visitors to Chile has been reduced
substantially, especially those from Spain and Britain, said the
director of the National Service for Tourism, Cesar Gomez.
</P>
<P>
Gomez attributed the reduction of British and Spanish tourists
to advice given by their governments and also by some European
travel agents.
</P>
<P>
He added that eventually those potential European tourists who
are planning to visit Chile will forget about the Pinochet case.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was detained on October 16 last year in London on the
request of Spanish courts probing killings of Spanish citizens
between 1973 and 1990 in Chile when Pinochet ran the country.
</P>
<P>
Though Pinochet has denied the charges, Britain is scheduled to
begin extradition proceedings on September 27.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Absorbs 5.6B Dollars Foreign Investment in 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar brought in a total of
5.641 billion U.S. dollars' foreign investment in 219 projects
from 22 countries and regions between April 1994 and April 1999,
according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The figures provided by Myanmar's Central Statistical
Organization show that of the total foreign investment absorbed
during the five-year period, the sum coming from member countries
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) totaled
2.966 billion dollars in 106 projects.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN investment amount and projects accounted for 52.58
percent and 48.4 percent of the total respectively.
</P>
<P>
Singapore ranked first in the line-up of investment from ASEAN
member countries with 1.087 billion dollars, followed by Thailand
with 961.2 million dollars and Malaysia with 533.4 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of foreign investment to Myanmar sharply decreased
as a result of the Asian financial crisis which broke out in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
During the period from July 1997 to April this year, Myanmar
drew in a total of 619 million dollars' foreign investment, of
which that from ASEAN member countries stood at 406 million
dollars, accounting for 65.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since adopting the open-door economic policy in late 1988,
Myanmar has obtained a total of 7.1 billion dollars' foreign
investment which came from 24 countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> OAS Backs Chile's Stand on Pinochet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of American
States (OAS) backed the position taken by the Chilean government
on the Pinochet case, Secretary General of OAS Cesar Gaviria said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Whatever crime a Chilean citizen has committed in Chile, it
comes under the jurisdiction of that country, Gaviria said in an
interview published in the Spanish newspaper "El Pais" Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the action of the Spanish Judge Baltazar Garzon who
ordered the detention of former Chilean military leader Augusto
Pinochet provokes judicial uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I believe the stand the Chilean government is
defending" is correct, added Gaviria.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government said the arrest of Pinochet in London
last October at the request of the Spanish judge was an extra-
territorial action.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Spanish Judge Garzon ordered 83-year-old Pinochet to
present himself in court in person to hear charges of human rights
abuses, including the disappearance of political opponents during
his military rule in 1973-1990.
</P>
<P>
Chile said that Pinochet should be allowed to return to his
country to stand trial there and also proposed that the Pinochet
case should be taken to international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the detention of Pinochet, Chilean President
Eduardo Frei canceled his presence at the Ibero-American Summit in
Havana in November.

BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The new terminal of the
Capital International Airport in Beijing has passed an initial

<HEADLINE> Chinese Universities Help Poor Freshmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Universities in China are
working on a variety of programs to help poor freshmen begin their
studies. The measures adopted include scholarships, loans,
allowances, reduction or exemption from tuition and work
opportunities, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing based English newspaper quoted an official from
Qinghua University as saying that no student will be forced to
quit college because of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the university set up a "green passage" from Beijing
railway station to the students' dormitory.
</P>
<P>
Students from poor families or regions were able to get loan
notices which they could hand in directly to the registration
office for part of all of their tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
The policy has been extended this year to cover more items for
which students must pay.
</P>
<P>
The tuition fee for most universities in Beijing is around 3,
000 yuan (360 U.S.dollars) per year. Undergraduate students also
need to pay 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan (60 U.S.dollars - 120 U.S.
dollars) per year for accommodation.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University has allowed new students from poor families
to defer payment of their tuition fees. Some poor first-year
students can obtain temporary subsidies. Those among the top five
of their provinces in the national college entrance examinations
are entitled to a new student scholarship worth 4,000 yuan (480 U.
S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
Similar programs or policies are being carried out in other
major universities, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education is also helping poor students.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, interest-free loans have been offered to poor
college students, and special scholarships have been granted to
students who major in agriculture, teaching and some other special
fields, and students from ethic minorities.
</P>
<P>
The ministry requires that at least 10 percent of tuition fees
collected by colleges should be spent on helping poor students,
the paper reports.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Hopes for Role in Regional Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Hungary hopes to play an
active role in the implementation of the Stability Pact for
Southeastern Europe (SPSE), introduced by the European Union, said
to a Economic Ministry press release.
</P>
<P>
Hungary also wants Italy's support on this matter, said the
ministry in the press release issued Wednesday after talks between
Hungarian Secretary of the Economic Ministry Gabor Gulacsi and
visiting Italian Secretary for Foreign Affairs Umberto Ranieri.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Gulacsi said the situation in southeastern
Europe has direct influence on Hungary, and the country is also
interested in economic stability and development in this region.
</P>
<P>
The government of Hungary plans to provide loans to
entrepreneurs in Yugoslavia to buy Hungarian machines. This way,
Hungarian enterprises could participate in economic reconstruction
in southeastern Europe, Gulacsi said.
</P>
<P>
Hungary, whose economy has suffered great losses in the past
ten years because of the situation in Yugoslavia, hopes the
Italian government will support it, the secretary added.
</P>
<P>
The SPSE, which was adopted in Cologne, Germany, on June 10,
1999, during an international meeting on the Balkan issue, is
aimed at sustaining long-term stability and security in the Balkan
region through measures such as promoting market economic
development and establishing regional security coordination.

<HEADLINE> CAW Chooses Ford Motor as Target of Contract Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Auto Workers (CAW)
has chosen Ford Motor Co. Wednesday as the target of its first
contract negotiations to be launched this fall.
</P>
<P>
Buzz Hargrove, president of CAW, the country's biggest workers
union, also announced that September 21 midnight will be the
deadline of strike, which has happened to Ford three times since
1970.
</P>
<P>
About 49,000 union workers will be involved in the upcoming
negotiations with the Big Three automakers when their current
three-year contracts expire on September 21.
</P>
<P>
The unions concentrate on talks with one company until an
agreement is reached. That contract then sets the pattern for
deals with the other two companies.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the UAW is still trying to decide whether
General Motors Corp. or DaimlerChrysler AG would be the first
company to negotiate with.
</P>
<P>
Ford Canada is producing some of the U.S. automaker's best
selling vehicles at a time when the North American market is
setting sales records, the media said.
</P>
<P>
But Ford company officials are reported to take the workers'
demand for better pay as tough to satisfy because of the hefty
costs.

<HEADLINE> Paper Industry Faces Challenges From Electronic Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The electronic information
revolution spells change, but not doom, for the world's paper
producers, according to a study on five markets released by a
global management consulting firm Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Boston Consulting Group's study provides an analysis of the
impact of electronic media on paper use over the next five years,
and identifies key factors that are driving information sources to
substitute digital distribution for physical distribution of data.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the pulp and paper industry, long
plagued by over-capacity and slowness to react, faces increased
challenges as the electronic screen replaces the printed page. But
opportunities remain in many areas of the business.
</P>
<P>
The consulting firm investigated paper consumption through the
year 2003 in the United States, Germany, Britain, France and Japan,
which comprise more than half the global graphic paper market.
Seven major applications, namely newspapers, magazines, catalogs,
books, direct mail, directories and office papers, were considered
in the study.
</P>
<P>
Overall, according to the study, worldwide consumption of paper
will continue to increase, with growth in most sectors offsetting
losses resulting from the switch to electronic media.
</P>
<P>
Consumption of cut-size office paper will double from 1996
levels by 2003, because of the increase in individual printing by
office and home printers.
</P>
<P>
Newsprint will be the biggest loser. About 15 percent of 1997
North American capacity will be superfluous by 2003, and for Japan,
about five percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the considerable information content of
most newspapers -- combined with high fixed cost and a
subsidization of content by advertising -- makes them particularly
vulnerable to both indirect and direct electronic substitution.
For the typical newspaper, which garners more than two-thirds of
its income from advertising, this indirect substitution will
trigger a loss of crucial income.
</P>
<P>
Classified advertisements, the biggest single revenue source
for newspapers, are already beginning to shift to online formats.
Online advertising revenues grew 240 percent in 1997 and 112
percent in 1998 in those markets. The study predicts that by 2003
about 15 percent of the U.S. classified market will be online; 10
percent each in the other four markets.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police arrested 219
suspected Tamil rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) on Tuesday night in a cordon and search operation in
Colombo, a newspaper here said Thursday.

Among those rounded up, the Sinhalese Island newspaper quoted
police as saying that at least nine of them are high ranking rebel
cadres.
</P>
<P>
These suspected rebels had recently infiltrated into the city
from the northern and eastern areas where the LTTE rebels have
been fighting against the Sri Lankan government for a separate
Tamil state since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Storm Kills 10 in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were
killed and 4,000 others injured by the Hurricane "Greg" in Mexico,
the authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Even though the phenomenon had converted into a tropical storm,
the authorities were maintaining a state of alert in the face of
heavy rains in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The states of Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco were most affected
by the tropical storm which destroyed around 250 dwellings.
</P>
<P>
Energy supply and road communication were affected in various
parts of the region and some ports were closed, but re-opened
again Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A military pilot was killed during rescue work in Chinicuila,
Michoacan, when the helicopter crashed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two people died in a wall collapse in La Minita, Michoacan,
while in Colima a person died when the vehicle in which he was
traveling was carried away by the swelling of the river Los
Mezcales.
</P>
<P>
According to rural authorities, around 500 heads of cattle
perished because of the rains which flooded the municipality of
Cihuatlan, in Jalisco.
</P>
<P>
The National Water Commission said that 11 dams in the state of
Sinaloa in east Mexico are now at full capacity after the flooding
caused by "Greg".
</P>
<P>
In central Mexico, the inundations caused flooding in the
states of Mexico and Morelos, while in the state of Hidalgo, the "
Endho" dam overflowed.

<HEADLINE> Spain, Norway and Sweden Qualify for Euro 2000 Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Spain, Norway and Sweden
clinched European championship finals berths on Wednesday in the
penultimate round of qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Spain and the two Scandinavian sides join the Czech Republic
and co-hosts Belgium and the Netherlands in next year's tournament,
leaving 11 places still up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
Perennial qualifiers Spain clinched top spot in group six with
an 8-0 thrashing of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Spain were 5-0 up at halftime and cantered home. Ismael Urzaiz
and Julen Guerrero both scored hat-tricks and Cesar Martin made it
seven and Fernando Hierro completed the rout two minutes from the
end.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen-year old Yossi Benayoun scored a hat-trick as Israel
thrashed San Marino 8-0 in to move into second place and Cyprus
will need to win in Austria to overhaul them even if Israel lose
their last game in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Norway cruised through with a 4-0 home group two win over
Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
A Rudi Istenic own goal got things going after 15 minutes, and
England-based trio Steffen Iversen, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and
Oyvind Leonhardsen completed matters.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia have the consolation of finishing second after Latvia
could only draw 2-2 at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, who were hosts for the 1992 finals, confirmed their
dominance of group five with a 1-0 win in Luxembourg -- Niclas
Alexandersson getting the only goal after 32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Poland need only draw their last game in Sweden to take second
place after drawing 0-0 with England in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
England, who had David Batty sent off after 84 minutes, never
looked like getting the win they needed and now need a Swedish win
over the Poles to finish second.
</P>
<P>
Denmark produced the performance of the night, coming from 2-0
down to beat Italy 3-2 in Naples and guarantee at least a play-off
place.
</P>
<P>
The Danes looked down out after early goals by Diego Fuser and
Christian Vieri.
</P>
<P>
Martin Joergensen pulled one back with a 39th minute penalty
and second half goals by Morten Wieghorst and Jon Dahl Tomasson
secured a famous win. Wieghorst was shown the red card after 81
minutes and Giuliano Giannichedda of Italy was sent off after 88
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Denmark have finished their games and top the group with 14
points, ahead of the Italians on their head-to-head record. Italy
can clinch top spot with a draw in Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, who beat Belarus 2-0, and Wales, cannot now
qualify.
</P>
<P>
Group four remains a bottleneck with Ukraine, France and Russia
battling it out after hard-fought away wins and Iceland still in
with an outside chance.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine stay top on 19 points after a 43rd minute Serhiy Rebrov
penalty gave them a 1-0 victory in Iceland. Russia and France are
a point behind.
</P>
<P>
The world champions came from 1-0 down to beat Armenia 3-2 with
goals from Youri Djorkaeff (penalty), Zinedine Zidane and Lilian
Laslandes.
</P>
<P>
French substitute Frederic Dehu was sent off in the 89th minute,
and Armen Shakgheldyan pulled a goal back with a last-minute
penalty.
</P>
<P>
France have one game left, at home to Iceland, where victory
for the hosts would ensure at least a place in the top two.
</P>
<P>
Russia edged Andorra 2-1 thanks to two goals by Viktor Onopko.
</P>
<P>
They host Ukraine in their last game and a Russian win would
guarantee a top two place and probably top spot.
</P>
<P>
In group eight, Yugoslavia and Ireland both chalked up their
expected victories but the qualification situation is still far
from clearcut.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia returned to the top of the group with an emphatic 4-
2 win over Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Savo Milosevic put the visitors ahead after 10 seconds and
Dejan Stankovic, Ljubinko Drulovic and a Boban Babunski own goal
had virtually settled it before halftime.
</P>
<P>
Ireland made hard work of overcoming Malta 3-2 after goals by
Robbie Keane and Gary Breen had them 2-0 up at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Malat fought back to level terms but Steve Staunton won it for
Ireland with a tremendous 72nd minute free kick.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia now have 16 points to Ireland's 15, with Croatia
third on 14. All three teams have one game left - Ireland against
Macedonia and, in what will be a emotional night in Zagreb,
Croatia against Yugoslavia when the Croats must win to make the
top two.
</P>
<P>
Scotland and Estonia fought out an action-packed goalless draw
in Tallinn to give the Scots the advantage in the race for second
spot in group nine.
</P>
<P>
Group nine winners Czech Republic made it nine wins out of nine
with a 3-0 home success over Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Scots have 12 points from eight games to Estonia's 11 from
nine but with home games against Bosnia and Lithuania to come they
are well-placed to clinch the play-off place.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania edged the Faroes 1-0 and also have 11 points from
nine with Bosnia on eight from eight.
</P>
<P>
Germany took charge of group three with a 4-0 home thrashing of
Northern Ireland, thanks to a first half hat-trick for Christian
Ziege and a second minute strike by Oliver Bierhoff.
</P>
<P>
Germany now have 18 points, two clear of Turkey who needed a
late goal by Tayfur Havatchu to draw 1-1 at Moldova.
</P>
<P>
Germany need only draw their final game against the Turks in
Munich to top the group. Turkey are already guaranteed second.
</P>
<P>
It's a similar situation in group seven where Romania kept
their single point lead over Portugal after the teams drew 1-1 in
Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
The Romanians need only win in Liechtenstein to top the group
while Portugal, already sure of second, must beat Hungary and hope
for a Romanian slip.
</P>
<P>
However, Portugal look likely to have the best record of the
nine runners-up and consequently will qualify automatically.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with more details (UPDATE) Japan's Economy Up in 2nd Quarter of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's gross domestic product (
GDP) rose 0.2 percent in the second quarter of 1999, the Economic
Planning Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It marked the second quarter in a row of growth after 2.0
percent in the period from January through March.
</P>
<P>
The growth was a surprise as economists surveyed by Dow Jones
Newswires had predicted Japan's GDP would contract 0.3 percent in
the second quarter from the first.
</P>
<P>
The planning agency attributed the economic growth largely to
public works spending and housing investment in the April-June
period.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who took office in July
last year, has vowed to recover Japan's economy and raise the
annual growth rate to at least 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government also announced earlier this week that
increasing demand from Asian countries was behind recent growth in
Japan's industrial output.

HELSINKI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Tarja Halonen, Finnish

Halonen added that the EU has delivered a message of great
concern to Ali Alatas, Foreign Minister of Indonesia. "We urged
Indonesia to turn to the UN Security Council and requested it to
authorize an international armed presence to assist Indonesia in
this task."
</P>
<P>
"We all share the same sense of urgency and gravity of the

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The government of Jilin
Province in northeastern China recently allocated two million yuan
(240,000 U.S. dollars) to expand protection of the Xianghai Swamp
Nature Reserve.
</P>
<P>
Concerned by severe drought conditions in the reserve in July,
Provincial Governor Hong Hu decided to channel more water into the
area, saying the rare animal species should be protected.
</P>
<P>
The reserve is located in Tongyu County in the western part of
the province, where the Inner Mongolian Plateau intersects with
the Northeast China Plain, and right in the flight path of
migratory fowl.
</P>
<P>
It covers more than 100,000 hectares and is home to 253 species
of birds, including red-crowned and white cranes, white storks,
and gold and gray vultures. The site was designated as a national
reserve in 1986 and a nature reserve by the United Nations
Wildlife Fund in 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, a four-year dry period has posed a considerable threat
to the survival of the waterfowl.

<HEADLINE> Jiang-Clinton Meeting to Be of Great Significance: Chinese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming
meeting between the Chinese and United States presidents will be
of great significance to the improvement of Sino-U.S. relations,
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting over breakfast with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Tang said that more
significantly, the summit meeting will have important and
far-reaching influence on the development of trans-century
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his U.S. counterpart Bill
Clinton will meet on the sidelines of the 7th informal meeting of
leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
scheduled for September 12-13 in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
Describing his meeting with Albright as "candid, useful and
significant," Tang recalled that the exchange of visit between
Chinese and U.S. heads of state and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's
visit to the United States in March served as a momentum and
opportunity for the development and improvement of the relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But a series of ensuing developments, particularly the May 7
U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, "have worsened
Sino-U.S. relations, and the responsibility is entirely on the
U.S. side," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, whether Sino-U.S. relations can continue to be
improved depends on whether the U.S. side can create favorable
conditions for the improvement of the relations by taking concrete
actions and steps, Tang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tang said another point he stressed to Albright was that "the
question of Taiwan is still the most sensitive, most salient and
most important issue in Sino-U.S. relations."
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that the United States should have a clear
recognition of the serious nature of this question and the
possible harm it could bring to Sino-U.S. relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that Lee Teng-hui is the biggest troublemaker, the
biggest obstacle and the biggest stumbling block in the way of
development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has repeatedly reiterated its adherence to the
one-China policy, its "three-no" commitment and its abiding by the
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, and Secretary Albright made a
clear-cut statement on these points in today's meeting, the
Chinese Foreign Minister said.

<HEADLINE> McEnroe Named U.S. Davis Cup Captain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- John McEnroe's long-time
dream of serving as captain of the United States Davis Cup team
became a reality Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
United States Tennis Association president Judy Levering
announced McEnroe's appointment Wednesday at the National Tennis
Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the proudest moments of my life," McEnroe said. "
The time is right for me now."
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, one of the greatest players of all-time who won 77
singles and 77 doubles titles, becomes the 37th U.S. Davis Cup
captain, replacing Tom Gullikson, the captain since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Levering said the selection process began at the beginning of
last month, when she met with Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Jim
Courier and Todd Martin to get their input on what they look for
in a captain.Each player submitted a list of two or three people
they would play for in Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
"They all said they want to play for John McEnroe," Levering
said.
</P>
<P>
McEnroe joined the U.S. Davis Cup team at the agoe of 19 in
1978, he compiled a 59-10 record in 30 ties over 12 years and
played on Cup-winning teams in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982 and 1992. He
holds American Davis Cup records for wins, ties played, years
played and singles wins.
</P>
<P>
"John personifies the spirit and tradition of Davis Cup,"
Levering said. "We are extremely pleased that he has decided to
accept the captaincy and are confident that he will be able to
convery his passion for Davis Cup to all the players on the team."
</P>
<P>
McEnroe expressed that his first priority as captain would be
to convince Sampras and Agassi to play. Agassi sat out a loss to
Australia in the quarterfinals this year while Sampras played only
doubles.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I garner enough respect to get Andre and Pete to play,"
McEnroe said. "Who doesn't want to see them play Davis Cup?"
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Agassi said he would never play Davis Cup
again, but there's reason to believe he will change his stance
with McEnroe as captain.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, on the other hand, has said he only would play for
Gullikson, whose twin brother, Tim, was Sampras' coach until dying
of brain cancer in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sampras did not play Davis Cup in 1998 or in this year's first-
round match against Britain. He returned to the team for the
quarterfinals against Australia, but Gullikson honored the
commitments of Martin and Courier.
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who expressed his interest in playing Davis Cup
doubles as recently as a few months ago, stated that it is "
certainly doubtful" that he would take the court.
</P>
<P>
With doubles as the weak point of the U.S. team in recent years,
McEnroe responded that "having Sampras and Agassi winning three
out of four singles matches" would alleviate the need for a solid
doubles team.
</P>
<P>
Gullikson finished with a 13-5 record in six years at the helm
of the team. During his tenure, the American squad defeated Russia
for the 1995 title and lost to Sweden in the 1997 finals.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Gullikson's efforts had been plagued by an
inability to get steady commitments from Sampras and Agassi. With
a weakened squad, the Americans fell to Italy in the 1998
semifinals and to Australia in this year's quarterfinals.

<HEADLINE>   Tyson to Fight Orlin Norris on October 23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson has chosen Orlin
Norris as his first opponent since his release from a jail, and
the fighting date is scheduled on October 23, at the MGM Grand in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
The 12-round fight is being billed as something called the WBC
international heavyweight title, according to the Associated Press
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited fight will be televised on Showtime. Norris is
the 33-year-old brother Terry Norris, who used to be one of the
best super middleweight fighters in the world.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who had served 3 1/2 months in a Maryland jail for
assaulting two motorists over a fender-bender, first chose the 33-
year-old former undisputed heavyweight champion James Douglas as
his opponent, but Douglas was ruled out for poor physical
condition.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who left the jail on May 24, is already training in Las
Vegas. The former heavyweight champion knocked out Francois Botha
in the fifth round on January 16 in the MGM Grand. It will be only
the second time in his 10 fights since 1990 that Tyson has not
fought on pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
Norris was a WBA cruiserweight champion in 1993-95. He has a
record of 50-5 since 1986 with 27 knockouts.

<HEADLINE> China Open-Minded on Peace-Keeping in East Timor: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China is open-minded on
sending an international peace-keeping force to East Timor, but it
needs Indonesia's consent and cooperation, said China's Deputy
Permanent Representative to the U.N. Shen Guofang Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks before the U.N. Security Council met in a
closed-door session on East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"China is very much concerned about the situation in East Timor
and we believe that the Indonesian government would take more
effective measures to stop the violence," he told reporters in the
Council lobby.
</P>
<P>
As to the suggestion that the international community send a
peace-keeping force to East Timor, Shen said the Council would
discuss it.
</P>
<P>
China is open-minded on the suggestion and it would like to
make a further study of the suggestion, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese envoy emphasized that the consent and cooperation
from the Indonesian government is very important before the
Council makes any decision on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise I don't think the peace-peeking mission will be
successful," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that any peace-keeping activity must be
authorized by the Council.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tech, Financial Firms Collaborating to </HEADLINE>

<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 8 (Xinhua) -- An alliance of U.S. major
computer and Internet firms Wednesday released a universal format
that it hopes to make it easier and more appealing for consumers
and businesses to pay for goods and services over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The format, known as Electronic Commerce Modeling Language
(ECML), uses a set of uniform field names that streamlines the
process by which merchants collect electronic data for shipping,
billing and payment.
</P>
<P>
According to the consortium which includes American Online,
IBM, Microsoft, Compaq, American Express, Visa and other blue-chip
companies, merchants today are conducting business on the Internet
using HTML-based forms. The data format used in these forms varies
from one merchant to another. End-users find the diversity
confusing and the process of manually filling in these forms to be
tedious.
</P>
<P>
Software tools called digital wallets can help this situation
by making the shopping experience easier for consumers. A digital
wallet is an application or service that assists consumers in
conducting online transactions by allowing them to store billing,
shipping and payment information, and to use this information to
automatically complete a merchant's check-out page. This greatly
simplifies the check-out process and minimizes the need for a
consumer to manually complete a merchant's form every time.
</P>
<P>
Digital wallets have been successfully built into browsers, but
the proliferation of digital wallets has been hampered by the lack
of standard.
</P>
<P>
Most Internet merchants use a variety of nonstandard forms. As
a result, most consumers have to enter their name, address, credit
card number and expiration date at every site each time they want
to make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
According to research firm Jupiter Communications, 27 percent
of consumers have abandoned items at the checkout line at a Web
storefront because they found filling out forms too tedious a
task.
</P>
<P>
Now ECML provides a simple set of guidelines for Web merchants
that will enbale digital wallets from multiple vendors to automate
the exchange of information between users and merchants.
</P>
<P>
ECML also can be used with existing data privacy and security
methods, according to the consortium. Online merchants can
implement ECML without a license. The alliance said that ECML is
the first in what will be a series of e-commerce standard
initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Canada Not to Take Unilateral Move in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada will not move
unilaterally into the current conflict of East Timor, Prime
Minister Jean Chretien said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We want to move in a multilateral way. I don't think that
Canada can move with troops in East Timor," he told reporters
after announcing the appointment of Adrienne Clarkson as governor
general in the foyer of the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
Chretien made the remarks a day before leaving for New Zealand
for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, where some
countries are likely to press Indonesia to allow peacekeepers into
East Timor, according to Canadian media reports.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian army declared a state of emergency in East Timor
Tuesday morning amid serious violence sparked after the
announcement of the direct autonomy ballot on September 4.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Defense Minister Wiranto has reiterated that the
Indonesian government can get its own security forces to restore
law and order in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Canada sent a team of observers at the end of last month for
the planned ballot. The country has also claimed to be "the third
largest donor to East Timor," providing more than 4 million
Canadian dollars (about 2.7 million U.S. dollars) this year to the
former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in 1976.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Ready to Assist Keeping Order in E.Timor: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Wednesday the United Nations is planning to go
ahead with international intervention in East Timor as the
situation there is deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
He said he told Indonesian President B.J. Habibie that "if they
(Indonesians) are unable to maintain law and order, then they
would have to accept international assistance... and this is
something the (Security) Council will press."
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks at the lobby of the Security Council
which was in closed-door session on East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The five-member team sent Monday by the Security Council is now
in Jakarta and it has had several meetings, while President
Habibie is going to meet the team Wednesday afternoon, the U.N.
chief told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The mission will press some of the points of concern to us,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said only time will tell if the new troops sent by the
Indonesian government to replace those in East Timor will improve
the security situation there.
</P>
<P>
"I think that there is too much killing, we cannot stand by and
allow the people of East Timor to be killed," Annan said,
expressing the U.N.'s determination to fully implement the results
of the August 30 ballot in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Security Council shared Annan's view "that if
the security situation does not improve within a very short period
of time, the Council will need to consider further action" to help
Indonesia achieve this objective, said a presidential statement
issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Violent activities by anti-independence militias following the
ballot have resulted in life losses, people's displacement and
threat to the security to the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET)
which organized the ballot.
</P>
<P>
The referendum was in favor of East Timor's independence
instead of special autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Due to the security concerns, Annan has authorized the
"thin-out" of UNAMET staff now numbering over 350 in East Timor.

<HEADLINE> Forecast on Italy's Economy Upped By Employers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Confindustria, the Italian
employers' association, Wednesday upped its forecasts for economic
growth in 1999 and 2000, confirming signs of a rally in the second
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Confindustria said it expected the 1999 GDP to rise 1.1 percent
and next year's by 2.2 percent. These figures compared to 0.9
percent and 1.9 percent in forecasts released last June.
</P>
<P>
"The gap that has existed for most of this decade between
Italian and European growth rates seems to be closing," the
organization's study center said.
</P>
<P>
Last year Italy had the European Union's lowest growth rate,
some 1.5 percent below the EU average. Confindustria said the
difference was likely to fall to 0.8 percent this year and 0.5
percent in the following two years.
</P>
<P>
Driving the mini-recovery were exports which were bouncing back
from the dive at the end of 1998 and also investments which were
expanding thanks to government incentives.
</P>
<P>
"But the gap with Europe has not yet been closed," employers
said. To do this lower taxes and freer markets were necessary,
along with a streamlined public administration and more modern
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government's most recent forecast for growth this
year was 1.3 percent, which would still put Italy at the bottom of
the European pile.
