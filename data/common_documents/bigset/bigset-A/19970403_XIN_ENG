<HEADLINE> British Conservative Promise Tax Cuts in Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- In a fresh effort to boost his
election campaign, British Prime Minister John Major today
promised to cut income tax, improve public service and curb crimes
if he is elected for another term.
</P>
<P>
Launching his manifesto for the May 1 general election, Major
vowed to cut the basic rate of income tax from 23 percent to 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
"We will remain the lowest taxed economy in Europe and press
toward a 20 percent basic rate of tax," he said.
</P>
<P>
Major, about 20 points behind Labor's Tony Blair, his main
rival, in recent opinion polls, is trying to narrow the gap by
wooing the floating voters who will not make their choice until
the last minute.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto, covering issues from public spending to welfare
reform and education, pledged tax breaks for people who stay at
home to take care of children or the sick.
</P>
<P>
Major also promised to improve public service and continue
tough policies on law and order -- keeping crime falling by tough
penalties for career criminals.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal must be to make Britain the best place in the world
to live," he said. "We are on course to meet my target of doubling
the living standards by 2020."
</P>
<P>
"It is time for change. Time for a change to the next phase of
Conservative prosperity," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, on the thorny issue of Britain's joining the European
single currency, Major was cautious and merely said that a new
Conservative government would not legislate in the first session
of a new parliament on the issue.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll published in today's Guardian newspaper showed
a four points drop in Labor's lead over the Conservatives compared
with last month's figure, a sign that raised Tories' hope for
further effect of the manifesto.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative party has been racked by split among its
members over European integration and a string of financial and
sexual scandals involving a dozen Conservative legislators.
</P>
<P>
Major began the election campaign on March 17 by announcing May
1 as the voting date, the longest electioneering of this
century. The Labor is also expected to announce its manifesto
today.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Raise Water Price: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
is considering to raise water price considerably in a bid to curb
the waste of the "scarce commodity", a top official said today.
</P>
<P>
Piet Pretorius, Director of Water Utilization, said water had
to become more expensive as it was a scarce commodity. He warned
that if not managed diligently, water sources in South Africa
would run out by the year 2030.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Water Affairs was reportedly drafting a
white paper on the pricing of water as part of the govenment's
effort to stretch the country's water supplies.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that water will become considerably more
expensive," Pretorius said, adding that the water services bill
would be another measure to preserve the country's water
resources.
</P>
<P>
To be tabled in parliament shortly, Pretorius said, the water
bill proposed a ban on the watering of gardens between 11 AM and
3 PM from October and March. Hosing down a car would also be
prohibited if the bill became law.

<HEADLINE> Life Banned Referee to Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Veteran referee Kurt Rothlisberger
has appealed against the life ban handed to him after European
football's governing body UEFA found him guilty of attempting to
fix a European Champions League match.
</P>
<P>
UEFA announced the news on Wednesday but the date and the venue
of the appeal has yet to be fixed, according to a press report.
</P>
<P>
UEFA said that Rothlisberger had tried to fix the 1996
second-leg tie between French first division side Auxerre and
Swiss champions Grasshopper Zurich. Auxerre had won the first-leg
1-0.
</P>
<P>
UEFA claim Rothlisberger contacted Grasshopper officials two
weeks before the match, saying he was a friend of the Belarus
referee in charge of the match and that if they wanted he could
fix the result.
</P>
<P>
Rothlisberger, one of the world's best known referees and
veteran of more than 1,000 matches, is reported to have demanded
over 60,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Grasshopper president Romano Spadaro and club coach Erich Vogel
 immediately contacted UEFA who opened an inquiry.

<HEADLINE> Controversy Heated Over Russian-Belarusian Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- While the Kremlin hastened toward
an overall union with Belarus, opposition to a quick integration
with Belarus is mounting in the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Belarusian President
Alexander Lukashenko today signed a brief document as a basis for
a union between the two former Soviet republics. They also
initialled a more detailed union charter, which is subject to a
month's public debate.
</P>
<P>
Although Belarus seemed eager to get the treaty clinched,
Russian leadership appeared divided over the integration, which
will coordinate the two countries' foreign, economic and defense
policies.
</P>
<P>
Boris Nemtsov, the newly-appointed First Deputy Prime Minister,
on Monday voiced his opposition to the accelerated unification,
saying it should not be rushed along.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the treaty was necessary, he said the
merger must not hurt the people of Russia and Belarus
economically, politically or socially, Itar-Tass News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the treaty should have been thoroughly considered
before being signed lest it might create mess afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Echoing him, leader of the liberal Yabloko, Grigory Yavlinsky,
said the time was not ripe for the union.
</P>
<P>
A rushed unification would only worsen the economic and
political situation both in Russia and Belarus, he said, adding
that provisions of the union accord needed revising.
</P>
<P>
However, Speaker of the State Duma (lower house of Russian
parliament) Gennady Seleznyov said on the eve of the signing
ceremony that most legislators back the treaty and the Duma will
most likely ratify it after a debate on April 9.
</P>
<P>
According to Seleznyov, the union is a first step and will be
followed by the creation of a confederation of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Duma Committee on Legislation and Court Reform,
Anatoly Lukyanov, said today that the union was bound to
materialize in this form or that in spite of the opposition from
some people.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that the move was a step to counter NATO's eastward
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the signing ceremony today, Yeltsin said that
the two countries would retain their sovereignty under the
treaty.

<HEADLINE> Proximity Talks in Cyprus Deal With Substance: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides deal
with the substance of the Cyprus problem, a senior Cypriot
government official confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
The official also said it would be "premature and
irresponsible" to conclude that the talks, conducted by
U.N. Resident Representative Gustave Feissel, have not yielded
any results.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides said that "discussions between President
Glafcos Clerides and Feissel cover the substance of the problem
and most of the time is taken up by issues relating to
substantive aspects of the Cyprus question."
</P>
<P>
These discussions are useful, the spokesman said, adding that
"obviously we are talking about good-will gestures."
</P>
<P>
However, Cassoulides declined to speak about progress on the
substance at the proximity talks, abiding by an agreement on not
to disclose the content of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Feissel has shuttled between the two sides and conveyed the
messages from one side to the other twice a week since March 10
when the proximity talks started.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed at breaking current deadlock on the Cyprus
 problem and paving the way for the U.N. proposed direct
negotiations between the leaders of the two community on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides also refrained from commenting on demands by
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash that foreign tourists
entering Cyprus from the Turkish occupied northern areas, are
allowed to visit the government controlled areas of the
Republic.
</P>
<P>
"I would not like to comment on such matters because they are
likely to be on the agenda of the proximity talks," he explained,
noting that matters pertaining movement of tourists will depend
on the essence of a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the conviction of foreign diplomats as
well as Cypriot and Greek officials that direct negotiations are
certain to take place, Cassoulides said "this assessment relies
on the hope that the proximity talks will lead to direct
negotiations in the first half of 1997."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has announced his
determination to bring the rival leaders Clerides and Denktash
into a direct negotiation table before the end of June this year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus remains divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Leader Meets Norwegian Storting President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, April 2 (xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), said
here today that there is no fundamental conflict of interest
between China and Norway and China is willing to enhance
consultation and cooperation with Norway.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, who arrived here this morning for a four-day official
visit to Norway, made the remarks when meeting with Kirti
Grondahl, President of the Norwegian Storting (parliament).
</P>
<P>
He said that Norway was one of the first Western countries to
establish diplomatic ties with China and the two countries have
identical views on major issues.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral cooperation and exchanges in various fields have
developed rapidly since the two countries established diplomatic
ties 40 years ago, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Jiang Zemin's state visit to Norway last
year pushed the bilateral relationship to a new stage and the
Chinese government and people look forward to the visit to China
by King Harald V.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that despite their different history and cultural
tradition, China and Norway can forge a long-term and stable
relationship of friendship and cooperation oriented to the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Grondahl hoped that the Norwegian Storting and the Chinese NPC
would further enhance their cooperation and exchanges.

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders Up 0.8 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories gained
by a moderate 0.8 percent in February following a strong 2.5
percent gain the month before, U.S. Commerce Department reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that overall factory orders in the month
rose to a seasonally adjusted 325.9 billion dollars, the record
high.
</P>
<P>
A big 7.1 percent gain in orders for communications and other
electronic equipment more than offset a 4.1 percent drop in
transportation equipment.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods, items expected to last for more than
three years, rose by 1.5 percent in February after shooting up 3.8
percent the month before. Non-durable goods orders increased by
0.1 percent after a 0.9 percent gain in January.
</P>
<P>
Orders for capital goods, excluding the volatile military and
transportation sectors, advanced 6.9 percent in February after a
3.1 percent rise a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of manufactured goods, a measure of current
production, increased 0.9 percent, the seventh gain in eight
months.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders rose by 0.9 percent, the sixth
consecutive gain. A growing backlog suggests businesses will have
to increase production and perhaps hire more workers to meet
demand.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that today's report fits with recent evidence of
robust growth during the first quarter in most economic sectors in
the country.
</P>
<P>
A report from the U.S. National Association of Purchasing
Managers said Tuesday that manufacturing in the U.S. strengthened
at the fastest pace in more than two years.

FREETOWN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Three editors of the independent

enemy, or the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) which has waged a
six-year rebel war in the west African state.
</P>
<P>
Justice ministry officials said the case will be transferred
shortly to the high court to try the accused in secret because of
the alleged documents bordering on state security.

BRUSSELS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's gross

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish State Minister Lutfu
Esengun said today that the Turkish government would take any
measures against racist attacks on Turkish citizens living in
Germany and in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Esengun made the remarks at a press conference in Istanbul,
the largest city of Turkey, before his departure for the
Netherlands and Germany for the investigations into the racist
attacks against Turks in the two states, according to the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Four members of a Turkish family died and another was
critically injured after an arson attack in Germany Monday.
</P>
<P>
In another case, six Turkish citizens including five children
died last week after leaping from their third-floor apartment
window when a fire broke out in their 13-story building in the
Hague, the Netherlands. Dutch police suspected that it was a
racial attack.
</P>
<P>
Esengun said that the Turkish people were deeply hurt by the
incidents happened in the above two countries, adding "all these
are the problems of humanity."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Turkish government will make
serious investigations into the incidents, saying that taking
measures to prevent the repetition of such incidents is more
important than to find those who were responsible for the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel today
strongly condemned the arson attacks on Turkish citizens living
in the Netherlands and Germany.
</P>
<P>
He called for the effective measures to be taken to protect the
lives of Turkish citizens living abroad.
</P>
<P>
Over 3.5 million Turkish citizens living abroad and most of
them are living in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Cutting Budget Deficit Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Planning Commissioner
Richard Hove has challenged senior civil servants to be
resourceful in coming up with realistic economic measures aimed
at effectively reducing government's budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day meeting for heads of government ministries
in Nyanga of eastern Zimbabwe today, Hove said Zimbabwe's second
phase of economic reforms must tackle the unfulfilled objectives
of the first phase.
</P>
<P>
He cited examples of unachieved goals of the first phase of
reforms like the huge public enterprise losses and the high
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is examining draft policy documents on the vision
2020 program and the Zimbabwe program for economic and social
transformation.
</P>
<P>
Hove said Zimbabwe's economic performance has improved as a
result of the good rainy season which resulted in real gross
domestic product growth of over eight percent in 1996 and
expectations that in 1997 it would grow by five percent.
</P>
<P>
He expressed fear that such good economic performance may not
be sustainable as it is influenced by the unpredictable weather.

<HEADLINE> Philips Finds Partner for Hearing Aids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Philips Hearing Instruments and
US company Micro-Tech have agreed a strategic alliance which they
hope will set an international standard for digital hearing aids,
the Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper says the US company is to use Philips' micro
chips and the software for its products.
</P>
<P>
"The strategic importance of the deal is also strong," a
Philips spokesman was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The new chip will give us a jump on the competition and could
become the world standard."
</P>
<P>
Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, and Micro-Tech aim to
present an improved hearing aid this month, according to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that both companies would continue to make
their own products, but would work together in their promotion and
distribution.
</P>
<P>
Philips hopes that deal will increase its market share in the
Untied States, but says it is targeting the medical market rather
than consumers.
</P>
<P>
The Philips spokesman said reportedly that the hearing aids
division met the profit targets outlined by Philips president Cor
Boonstra, but declined to give actual profit or turnover figures.

<HEADLINE> Breastfeeding Transmission of HIV Small: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Consultant paediatrician Rose
Kambarami said here today only five percent of all babies born in
Zimbabwe are at risk of acquiring HIV through breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on ''HIV and Breastfeeding'' at a Harare general
hospital breastfeeding commemoration week, Kambarami said about
120,000 babies out of the 400,000 of contracting the deadly HIV,
while 30 percent of the mothers were HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
She said, ''just because a mother is carrying HIV does not
mean that the baby will definitely get the virus. There is a
50-50 percent chance that the baby will contract the virus.''
</P>
<P>
''Only 60,000 out of the 400,000 babies born every year will
eventually get the infection,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Kambarami said a third of the 60,000 mothers would infect
their babies during delivery, while another third infected them
during pregnancy, another third of the women would transit HIV to
their babies through breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
She said Zimbabwe could not abandon the whole initiative of
baby friendly clinics because of the five percent given the
enormous benefits of breastfeeding.

<HEADLINE> UK House Prices Keep Steady Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- House prices in Britain are
continuing to rise, but at a relatively modest pace and there is
no indication of a return to a 1980s-style boom, according to
separate figures published by building society, banks and
insurers.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax Building Society, the country's biggest mortgage
lender, said today that house prices rose by one percent last
month after an 0.6 percent increase in February, the best monthly
figure since December and taking annual price rises to 7.2
percent, compared with 6.8 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The average house price last month was 67,334 pounds (110
thousand US dollars), the biggest price recorded by the Halifax
since November 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, the building society said that despite the sharp rise
in house prices during March, UK prices are still 4.2 percent
below their peak in May 1989, and latest figures for the number of
property transactions in England and Wales showed a fall of 4.1
percent in February compared with January.
</P>
<P>
UK property market's steady recovery is also shown by insurers
Legal &AMP; General's latest survey and the latest bank lending
figures.
</P>
<P>
Legal &AMP; General's survey of 1,000 people found that, while
housing market activity continues to increase, there are no signs
of the market overheating and the market remains an orderly one.
</P>
<P>
It gave three reasons why the market would remain "orderly".
First, the number planning to move in the next 12 months had
fallen from 26 percent last September to 17 percent. Second,
nearly two-thirds of people expected interest rates to rise and
lastly, there is the uncertainty caused by the May 1 general
election.
</P>
<P>
The firmer housing market picture was also shown by figures
offered by the British Bankers Association Tuesday, which said
that Britain's banks made gross home loans of 2.15 billion pounds
(3.5 billion US dollars) in February, three percent up on
January's figures.
</P>
<P>
However, the increases were much stronger at the same time a
year ago with both volume and value rising 32 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sixth Session of Confernece of African Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The three-day Sixth Session of
the Conference of African Ministers of Finance ended this afternoon
after adopting a declaration and two resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The ''Addis Ababa Declaration of the African Ministers of Finance
on Growth and Development Finance in Africa at the Turn of the
Century, Financial Sector Reforms and the African Debt Problem''
stressed that the deepening and broadening of Africa's financial
sector and development of efficiently functioning capital markets
will need to be a major priority as Africa moves to the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The declaration acknowledged the role multilateral financial
institutions have played in assisting Africa to mobilize resources
required to support development and in undertaking economic and
financial reforms and urged them to continue to provide a greater
proportion of the concessional finance and grants needed to support
Africa's infrastructural development and delivery of social services.
</P>
<P>
On Africa's debt problem, the declaration noted that ''despite
notable efforts by African countries and the international community
to reduce the burden of debt service for African countries, the
stock of debt to exports ratio continues
to increase''.
</P>
<P>
''The stock of debt is estimated at 340.5 billion US Dollars
at the end of 1996 and total debt service payments amounted to 24
billion us dollars,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
The declaration welcomed the heavily indebted poor countries
(HIPCS) initiative launched by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund in September 1996 and said the ''initiative is a
partial reflection of the commitment of the international community
to finding a lasting solution to the African debt problem''.
</P>
<P>
''African countries continue to devote a large proportion of
their resources to servicing their external debts, when their social
sectors and infrastructures are in dire need of rehabilitation and
reconstruction,'' the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
It called on Africa's ''development partners to assist the
region in finding practical and lasting solutions to the twin
debt and poverty problems''.
</P>
<P>
''The challenges of globalization and liberalization of the
world economy as well as financial markets dictate that our
countries adapt rapidly to these developments if our continent is
to become an effective partner in the international economy. We
are committed to the process of ensuring that Africa moves in
that direction and call on the international community to
supplement our efforts with significant resources and appropriate
support,'' the declaration concluded.
</P>
<P>
''The Resolution on Growth and Development Finance in Africa and
Financial Sector Reforms'' urged African countries to continue with
their economic and financial reforms, with a view to achieving
sustainable development for their economies and for their effective
integration in the world economy and among themselves and appealed
to the international community to step up significantly their
financial support to African countries in the implementation of their
economic and financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
''The Resolution on the Debt Problem and Its Impact on Afirca's
Development Process'' called upon African countries in collaboration
with the international community and multilateral institutions to
intensify their efforts to find a durable solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day discussion, African ministers of finance and
central bank governors reviewed the state of development finance,
financial sector reforms and the African debt problem and had a
constructive dialogue with Africa's development partners on a
number of development issues of importance to the continent. African
minsiters reaffirmed their commitment to economic and financial
sector reforms and in collaboration with their development partners
to finding a lasting solution to the African debt problem.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Growth Rate Slows Down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The rate of growth in the
manufacturing sector of Britain's economy slowed in March to its
lowest level since last Summer, although it grew for the tenth
month in a row, as companies laid workers off to keep costs under
control.
</P>
<P>
The latest monthly purchasing managers' survey showed today
that the Purchasing Managers' Index, which takes account of a
range of indicators in determining the overall health of
manufacturing industry, fell from 53.4 to 52.9 in March, although
it was above the 50 points level that indicates the sector is
growing.
</P>
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which
prepares the figures, said the overall decline in the index was
mainly caused by the first fall in manufacturing employment for
almost a year.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, since May 1996, more managers reported a
lower level of employment than a higher level, and the employment
index dipped to 49.4, a fall of 1.5.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the strong pound is also holding back
growth, with exports running at levels below those seen in the
last quater of 1996, although a pick-up in European markets led
to a slight improvement in the month's export output figures.
</P>
<P>
The strong pound also meant prices paid for raw materials and
components fell for the 17th months in a row in March.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said that the figures were unlikely to change
the current view that official interest rates would rise by 0.25
percent soon after the general election on May 1.

CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Four million tourists visited Egypt
in 1996, a 24.3 percent rise over the previous year, the Egyptian
MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
A security report by the Egyptian Interior Ministry said that
Egypt received 2 million tourists in first half of 1996, nearly
half a million more than the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
It praised the efforts exerted by the tourism and antiquities
police department in guaranteeing the safety and security of
tourists visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
Egypt witnessed some militant attacks last year, triggering
fears that tourism, the country's second largest foreign currency
earner, might be hurt.
</P>
<P>
Last April, 18 Greek tourists were killed at the Europa Hotel
in Cairo suburb.
</P>
<P>
Despite the actions, the tourism revenues reached 3 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, 710 million dollars more than that of 1995.

African States (ECOWAS), Nigeria's Head of State General Sani
Abacha, has asked Liberia to induct the commission today.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, a broker of Liberia's peace, has mandated Nigerian
Foreign Affairs Minister Tom Ikimi to go to Liberia to constitute
an independent electoral commission acceptable to both the
Liberian people and the former warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi, who arrived in Monrovia on Tuesday, said at today's
inauguration ceremony that the induction of the commission is an
important step towards the national polls.
</P>
<P>
He called on Liberia's ruling Council of State, political
parties and all Liberians to work together to ensure the
elections to be held as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached by ECOWAS heads of state in
Abuja, Nigeria, last year, the electoral commission will comprise
10 members, including three delegates respectively from the
United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
A retired Nigeria diplomat has been appointed as the
representative of ECOWAS and left for Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The other seven members will separately come from three former
major warring factions, youth's organization, women's group, trade
unions and the coalition of political parties.

<HEADLINE> African Medical Experts Combat Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A workshop is being held here to
define strategies for curbing acute malaria, the number one
killer disease in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts from 13 African countries are attending the
workshop, which started Tuesday and was sponsored by the World
Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
During the two-week workshop, medical experts will share
experiences and learn methods of eradicating acute malaria so as
to improve their knowledge and practices in health personnel
training and in tackling severe malaria cases.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to map out plans for health personnel in
their countries.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is one of the most important health concerns in more
than 90 countries in the world with an incidence of 300 to 500
million cases each year, almost 90 percent of the cases in
Sub-Sahara Africa.
</P>
<P>
Some one million Camerounians suffer from malaria each year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Public Health Minister Titus Edzoa said that 30
percent of the deaths in the country's hospitals are
malaria-related.
</P>
<P>
He added that most of the deaths are children under age
five.
</P>
<P>
A doctor from the Comoros said malaria is the first
cause of infant mortality and kills 18 to 20 percent of all
patients in his country although a national program was launched
15 years ago for curbing malaria in that country.
</P>
<P>
An expert from Chad said malaria is virtually unheard of in
the northern part of Chad but remains the number one killer
disease in the south of the country. enditem

<HEADLINE> France Hails Presence of Greek Troops in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Charles
Millon today hailed the plan by Greece to send 700 soldiers to
Albania to join the international protection force in the Balkan
state.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with his Greek counterpart, Akis
Tsohatzopoulos, Millon said that he is happy that French and Greek
soldiers can be deployed side by side in Albania to ensure the
arrival of humanitarian aid to Albanian people.
</P>
<P>
France will send 1,000 soldiers to Albania to guard the
unloading of international humanitarian goods at the port of
Durres and their transport to the capital Tirana.
</P>
<P>
The multinational protection force, proposed by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and approved
by the United Nations Security Council last week, will be headed
by Italy and also joined by Spain and Turkey. They will arrive in
Albania by April 10.
</P>
<P>
Millon and Tsohatzopoulos also discussed bilateral relations
between France and Greece, security in the Mediterranean region,
and the construction of the West European Union and the North
Atlantic Alliance.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell a great convergence of views (between France and
Greece). We hope that the initiatives taken in the framework of
the United Nations will lead to the positive solutions (of the
Albanian crisis) and allow the reinforcement of security and the
guarantee of peace in this region of Europe," said Millon.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he and Tsohatzopoulos agreed that NATO should
reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine over NATO expansion,
and that Romania should be admitted by NATO in the first wave of
its expansion.

<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- British opposition Labor Party
launched its manifesto today, promising not to raise income tax
rates, guarantee low inflation, create jobs and put education the
number one priority if it wins the May 1 election.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the 10-point manifesto, Labor leader Tony Blair
vowed to undertake state health and welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
He would impose heavy tax on windfall profits of water, gas,
electricity and other companies, which were privatized by the
Conservatives, to create jobs for 250,000 people in the dole
queues.
</P>
<P>
Blair said his "contract with people" also included a
wide-range reform in education and a reinforcement of Britain's
role in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said the manifesto was not a radical program, but "in tune
with the times and instincts of today's Britain."
</P>
<P>
The ruling Conservatives published their manifesto on
Wednesday, promising income tax cuts, public service reform and
fighting crimes.
</P>
<P>
Labor led Prime Minister John Major's Conservatives by 27
points in a latest opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
Blair, 43, would be Britain's youngest prime minister of this
century if he beats Major in the election.

<HEADLINE> China Should Accelerate Medical Guarantee System Reforms: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China should accelerate its
reforms of the medical guarantee system covering urban workers and
staffs of government institutions, a government official said
today.
</P>
<P>
The present medical guarantee system, established in early 1950s,
are no longer suitable to the demands of a socialist market
economy in China, Song Xiaowu, director of the Distribution and
Social Security Department of the State Commission for Economic
Restructuring, said here at an on-going international seminar on
social guarantee funds management.
</P>
<P>
The old system, under which all medical expenses are borne by
the government, institutions, and enterprises, lacks an effective
mechanism to impose restrictions on both the hospitals and
patients, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Doctors in some hospitals often over-prescribed medicine or
wrote out the so-called human relationship prescription, and the
employee's family members and relatives got the medicine easily
because of his entitlement to public health services, resulting in
huge losses," Song explained.
</P>
<P>
The practice of all expenses covered by the state, government
institutions, or enterprises lacks a rational mechanism to raise
social medical funds and encourage the individuals to accumulate
funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
Covering only the government departments, institutions, state
firms, and a part of the collective enterprises, the old system can
not meet the demand of a common development of various economic
sectors and hampers the rational flow of the labor forces among
enterprises of different ownership, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the Ministry of Finance show that the
medical expenditures of Chinese workers nationwide totaled 2.7
billion yuan in 1978 and surged to 55.8 billion yuan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Official data also show that the per person-time medical
expenses grew an average 30 percent between 1991 and 1995 in
hospitals at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels and
those directly under the Ministry of Public Health, far exceeding
the increase rate of the gross domestic product during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
In an official survey of 1,000 workers last year, 47 percent of
the respondents, or the largest proportion, said that they were
most concerned about the reform in the medical guarantee system,
</P>
<P>
"This manifests the necessity and urgency to accelerate the
reform of the medical guarantee system," Song said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has taken a positive and reliable step
toward medical guarantee system reform for it is a very
complicated work, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In early 1994, the cities of Zhenjiang and Jiujiang, in
eastern Jiangsu and Jiangxi provinces, were selected to pilot a
medical guarantee system reform program, which was expanded to
over 50 cities in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Considerable progress has been made in the experimental areas,
Song said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the objectives of China's medical guarantee
system reform are to set up a social medicare security system that
combines overall social planning funds with contributions from
personal savings and to make the system cover all laborers in
cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar, co-sponsored by the Ministry of Finance
and Lincoln National Corporation of the United States, was
launched Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam
Nujoma has told national parliament that he would accept a third
term in office if asked to do so, reports reaching here today
said.
</P>
<P>
"I am still young... and if the people of Namibia want me to
continue making a contribution, I will do so," Nujoma, 67, told a
parliamentary joint sitting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Namibian constitution, a state president may only
hold office for two five-year terms.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma told BBC reporters last year that he would step down
when his second five-year expired in 1999. However, in a later
interview he told Zimbabwe state TV that he would stay on if
asked to do so by the people and the ruling South West Africa
People's Organization (SWAPO).
</P>
<P>
More recently, he told the state-run newspaper New Era that he
would be ready to resign in 1999, the Namibian newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
At its congress last month, the SWAPO Elders Council voted to
ask Nujoma to stand for a third term.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted political observers as
saying that the subject would be likely to top the agenda at a
SWAPO congress scheduled for later this year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian FM Blasts Rumors About Soeharto's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas today rapped a number of foreign media for spreading rumors
about President Soeharto's health in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
"Their reports about the president's health have been negative.
Some were also speculative," he said after meeting with Soeharto
at the Bina Graha presidential office.
</P>
<P>
In the last several days, certain foreign media have been
sending out reports that the president was having some problems
with his health.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, one of them even reported that Soeharto suffered
from a "mild stroke" which then affected the activities of the
Jakarta Stock Exchange as well as the bourses in the neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the foreign press should concentrate on following
President Soeharto's activities instead of spreading such rumors.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Soeharto, Alatas reported his planned
visit to India for the ministerial meeting of the Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM) scheduled to take place from April 7 to 8.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the NAM meeting, Alatas will also pay a working visit
to India.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the NAM meeting, Alatas will hold talks
with foreign ministers of the countries which once chaired the NAM
and also with his counterparts from ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
All the seven members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- are also members of the NAM.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting with my ASEAN colleagues will take place on April
7. However, there will be no specific agenda for the occasion," he
said.
</P>
<P>
There are about four major topics to be discussed. "They are
about how to enhance the role of the NAM in the international
politics, how to eradicate poverty, how to carry out better
coordination to reform the U.N. and how to handle the issues of
nuclear disarmament," Alatas said.

<HEADLINE> Textbooks Teach Farmers To Live A Healthy Life (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- "Which kinds of infectious
diseases can humans get from sheep and pigs?" "Why should people
take iodized salt?" "How can hepatitis be prevented?"
</P>
<P>
Such questions are not just discussed by well-schooled
physicians: poorly-educated Chinese farmers also want answers, and
will get them thanks to a new series of books on health-related
questions that are common in China's vast rural areas, where three
fourths of the country's 1.2 billion population live.
</P>
<P>
The first 10,000 three-volume sets, titled "Textbooks of Health
Education for 900-Million Chinese Farmers," will be distributed
free of charge to rural households in seven provinces, as well as
the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Hunan Science &AMP; Technology Publishing House, the publisher,
announced the book donation program in Beijing today, hoping the
texts will play a successful role in China's nationwide campaign
to spread health knowledge among rural residents.
</P>
<P>
"I believed these will be very helpful textbooks for both
doctors in the countryside and farmers," said Minister of Health
Chen Minzhang, who is leading the campaign, launched in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The books are written plainly with easy-to-understand
expressions, and some include illustrations.
</P>
<P>
The volumes include more than 1,200 questions and answers
covering every aspect of rural residents' health, such as basic
knowledge about diseases commonly existing in rural areas,
treatments, healthy birth, good hygiene, and sexual education.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the generally low education level of farmers, we
have to make sure that they can understand the books," said one of
the editors.
</P>
<P>
To do so, the authors went to villages to talk with farmers
until they were satisfied the books were understandable, the
editor said.

<TEXT>
<P>
"In addition to video and cassette tapes, the textbooks will
become a helpful tool for teaching farmers health know-how,
because they are easy to buy and can be referred to often," said
an official involved in the educational campaign.
</P>
<P>
China's health authorities, in concert with agricultural, radio
and television departments, have produced more than 100 video and
radio programs of health education in the past three years. Most
of them have been broadcast in rural areas by national and local
radio and TV stations.
</P>
<P>
However, health officials admitted that it is still a hard work
to further improve health conditions of Chinese farmers, despite
big strides which have been made in the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
Due to low education level, poor health awareness, and
unhealthy lifestyles, many Chinese farmers are vulnerable to
illnesses, including iodine deficiency, snail fever, hepatitis and
tuberculosis, they said.
</P>
<P>
"The worse thing is that treatment for the illnesses may cost
farmers too much and they will be poorer than before," an official
said.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that among poor farmers, 60 to 70 percent were
reduced to poverty by huge medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
Both health officials and medical experts believe the poor
health condition of the rural population will be the biggest
challenge facing China's goal of "health for everyone" by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
"We will make greater efforts to improve farmers' health
conditions since the central government has urged us to place
utmost importance on this job in the next 15 years," said Health
Minister Chen Minzhang.
</P>
<P>
"But maybe the most important thing is that farmers should
learn how to protect themselves from diseases," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK's Freedom of the Press Fully Guaranteed After Its Return (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Freedom of the press in Hong Kong
will be fully guaranteed and protected by law in accordance with
the provisions of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region after it returns to the motherland, China's
top information officer said today.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Jianhui, director of the Information Office of the State
Council, made the remark here today while speaking at a forum to
mark the seventh anniversary on April 4 of the promulgation of the
Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The media in Hong Kong and throughout the world are greatly
concerned about the future of Hong Kong's freedom of the press, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong
Kong, the Chinese government promised to guarantee Hong Kong
residents' freedom of speech and publication, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the drafting of the Basic Law, Zeng said, ensuring Hong
Kong residents' freedom of the press was specially included at the
request of the press circles in the region. This clearly shows
that the Basic Law specially guarantees freedom of the press, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisions of the Basic Law, after Hong Kong
returns to the motherland on July 1, freedom of the press in Hong
Kong will be guaranteed and fully protected by law.
</P>
<P>
Zeng stressed that the information departments and institutions
in the Chinese inland areas and in Hong Kong will not be
subordinated to each other or interfere in each other's affairs.
</P>
<P>
The management method of the inland media shall not be used in
Hong Kong, and Hong Kong will act in accordance with its original
operation mechanism and rules of operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Neither can Hong Kong's own way of managing the media be
adopted by the Chinese inland areas, he said, commenting that
"well water does not flow into river water, and vice versa."
</P>
<P>
The inland press and information departments will act in
accordance with the state laws for the inland areas, while Hong
Kong institutions with the Basic Law, he added. The inland
journalists should observe the Basic Law and other Hong Kong laws
while covering news in Hong Kong, while the Hong Kong journalists
also should abide by the inland laws when they cover news in the
inland areas, he stressed.

<P>
Of course, Zeng noted, any freedom is relative and limited;
there is no absolute freedom or freedom without limits in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand we are talking about freedom of the press and
on the other hand we are stressing journalists' professional
ethics. News writing should be true and impartial," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng went on to say that no society will ever allow the media
to cheat the the public or misdirect public opinion by using
fabricated information, without considering its social
responsibility or the damage that can be caused to people's
reputations by vilification.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing such actions will not hinder freedom of the press,
but rather protect it, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said in the world community, "we often hear such strange
stories as 'Hong Kong people are deprived of their democracy and
freedom', and 'Hong Kong's human rights are not guaranteed', which
are groundless charges against the Chinese government."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong reversion bill adopted by the U.S. House of
Representatives in mid-March questioned, without good grounds,
whether the Chinese government will abide by the Sino-British
Joint Declaration after July 1, and made unwarranted charges
against the necessary measures China had taken to ensure Hong
Kong's smooth transition, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a few Hong Kong people are "flapping their jaws" in
other parts of the world in an attempt to weaken Hong Kong and
discredit the Basic Law and Hong Kong, he said that these
discordant voices will not prevail over that of justice.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said Hong Kong's smooth transition is in keeping with the
will of the people and its prosperity and stability conforms to
people's expectations. He stressed that any attempt to create
disturbances, misguide world opinion and sabotage Hong Kong's
return will never be successful.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A global telemedicine conference
has been scheduled to herald the historic handover of Hong Kong at
the midnight on June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
Doctors and medical students at the Chinese University of Hong
Kong will be globe-trotting with the sun in the Global
Telemedicine Conference, a 24-hour live audiovisual link-up around
the world which starts at Prince of Wales Hospital at 4:00 PM on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
The organizers have adopted "Moving With the Sun" as its theme.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first telemedicine conference to make a full
sweep of the globe, according to Professor Mgnus Hjelm, chairman
of the university's Department of Chemical Pathology.
</P>
<P>
"The timing of the conference will better promote telemedicine
in Hong Kong as well as share the historic moment of the handover
with medical communities overseas. We received very enthusiastic
response from around the world to the idea of combining the two
events," he was quoted by local newspaper South China Morning Post
today as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 15 medical institutions in Europe, North America, South
America, Australia and Asia, including three in the Chinese
mainland, are expected to take part.
</P>
<P>
The conference will start and finish with communications with
the People's Liberation Army General Hospital in Beijing, which
will have a link with Hong Kong throughout the event.
</P>
<P>
Prince of Wales Hospital will introduce telemedicine in Hong
Kong and beam live broadcasts from Victoria Harbor, the Peak and
the Chinese University's campus in co-operation with commercial TV
stations.
</P>
<P>
Each of the international sites will be hooked up for about 60
to 90 minutes and changing links will be kept as the sun rises on
individual sites.
</P>
<P>
Contents of the conference include latest research and
development in telemedicine, interviews with local health
officials, showing physicians making rounds in hospitals and
comments from patients who have experienced clinical services
through telemedicine conference.
</P>
<P>
The use of telemedicine technology for education and providing
distance medical care and consultation at the Hong Kong university
has become more systematic since it held its first international
conference in November last year, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Coach Jorge Says he will Sue Sa Pinto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese national soccer coach
Artur Jorge said on Thursday he was considering suing Ricardo Sa
Pinto after Sa Pinto attacked him at a training session last week.
</P>
<P>
Jorge said he wanted to take legal action against the striker
because Sa Pinto failed to apologize to him directly and had
"slanderous manoeuvres to change and falsify the facts afterwards".
</P>
<P>
Sa Pinto was reportedly to have struck Jorge at the national
team's training ground here last Wednesday, venting his anger for
not being selected for the team.
</P>
<P>
The squad was then preparing for a World Cup qualifier against
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Sa Pinto apologised for his act to the country and his club but
did not mention Jorge by name.
</P>
<P>
Sa Pinto has been suspended from the national team pending an
inquiry.

<HEADLINE> Ports of Entry of Guangdong and Hongkong to Cooperate more Closely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Shared information through the
Internet and unified standards of commodity inspection are among
the achievements hoped-for between Guangdong Province's and
Hongkong's ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
A study on strengthening cooperation between the ports of entry
of the two places after Hongkong is turned over to the motherland
in July 1 is now under way.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to create a more efficient port of entry
mechanism for the increasing trade and passenger flows of the two
localities", said a participant of a national ports of entry work
conference which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the principle of "one country, two systems", safeguarding
the national interests, and facilitating the flow of goods and
people, the plan calls for complying the work of the ports of
entry with international practices.
</P>
<P>
It suggests simplified procedures for cargo and more freedom of
passage for vehicles.
</P>
<P>
It proposes to use the Internet to share information on the
passenger and cargo flow, and the condition of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is one of the most developed regions of China and
the ports of entry linking it with neighboring Hongkong are of
great importance.
</P>
<P>
The Luohu Port of Entry in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone,
for example, is China's largest passenger port of entry, while the
Huanggang Port of Entry, also in Shenzhen, is the largest cargo
outlet.
</P>
<P>
Experts say if the cooperation plan can be approved by the
Central Government and by the authorities of the two regions, it
can be realized in three stages, possibly between 1998 and
2005.

<HEADLINE> Motorola's Tianjin Plant Sees Fast Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Motorola's Tianjin Plant takes
several firsts among the foreign-funded enterprises in the port
city in north China, according to Zhang Lichang, mayor of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
"The plant is the No. 1 in terms of growth rate, economic
results, and production scale," he told the visiting Robert
Galvin, chairman of board of Motorola Corp.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said as one of China's major coastal opening-up cities,
Tianjin will continue its support for Motorola and welcomes all
other large corporations in the world to establish cooperation
with city.
</P>
<P>
Since Motorola's wholly-funded Tianjin Plant began operation in
1992, its volume of business has leapt from 50 million US dollars
to two billion dollars last year. The profits last year hit 350
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the mobile phone production increased from 27,000
units four years ago to 2.1 million units, taking 40 percent of
the market share in China last year.
</P>
<P>
The company ranked second among China's top 500 foreign-funded
enterprises last year. Its investment in China has hit 1.2 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Galvin paid a visit to China to mark the tenth anniversary of
Motorola in China.

<HEADLINE> Israel Drops Request for Hamas Chief Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government issued a
statement today announcing what it called a suspension in "its
request to extradite Hamas leader Mussa Abu Marzook to Israel."
</P>
<P>
According to the statement faxed to Xinhua by the Prime
Minister's Office, the Israeli government "has informed the
United States that at this stage it wishes to suspend its
request."
</P>
<P>
"The decision was made by the Prime Minister and other
ministers dealing with the issue after consultations with the
relevant legal and security authorities," said the document,
adding that the decision was made on the basis of considerations
"relating to security and the prevention of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Abu Marzook, a 46-year-old Hamas political leader, was
arrested by the U.S. police in New York 20 months ago on
charges that he had connections with Hamas suicide bombing
attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel originally wanted the U.S. authorities concerned to
extradite Abu Marzook to the Jewish state for trial. In January,
Abu Marzook gave up his fight against extradition and said he
wanted to go to Israel to face the alleged charges.
</P>
<P>
As there is no sound evidence to support the charges, the case
has turned into a political hot potato both for the U.S. and
Israel. The latter fears that should Abu Marzook be brought to the
country, it would be tantamount to inviting Hamas to launch a new
wave of retaliatory attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Abu Marzook's announcement set in motion a 60-day clock for
extradiltion. His lawyer Michael Kennedy demanded this week that
his client be released from the federal jail in New York  because
60 days had passed.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. Federal Prosecutor Baruch Weiss argued that the
60-day mark is Sunday. He also said ironically that the
U.S. could continue to hold Abu Marzook because there is a
separate immigration case pending against him.

planned to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
in Washington this week.

National Authority (PNA), told Palestinian Radio that Arafat had

U.S. government was making efforts to arrange an Arafat-Netanyahu
summit when the latter travels to Washington this weekend. He said
the U.S. asked both Israel and the PNA to send representatives to
the U.S. capital to discuss the possibility of holding such a
summit.
</P>
<P>
Rudeineh confirmed that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright made a telephone call to Arafat Wednesday to discuss the
current situation. he said Albright expressed her willingness to
visit the Middle East soon in a bid to defuse the tension and
restart the stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. State Department and Israeli Prime Minister's
Office have denied the possibility of holding an Arafat-Netanyahu
meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel said Netanyahu would hold a summit with
Jordanian King Hussein in Washington Sunday, which the the
monarch is currently visiting while undergoing a medical surgery.
</P>
<P>
Regarding reports that Clinton would press Netanyahu to freeze
the controversial Har Homa settlement construction for six months
during their meeting next Monday, Netanyahu's spokesman Shai
Bazak said the Israeli prime minister would make clear to the
U.S. that his country retained the right to build settlements
either in East Jerusalem or elsewhere on the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Bazak said the purpose of Netanyahu's Washington visit was to
underscore Israel's demand on the PNA to launch a long-term
crackdown on extremism as the condition to resume the peace
talks.

who tested positive for doping last year will not be punished due
to possible discrepancies in doping procedure, the Asian soccer

</P>
<P>
AFC Secretary-general Peter Velappan said the world soccer body
FIFA has investigated the case which happened during December's

<HEADLINE> Song Jian: Poverty Eradication Not at Expense of Destroying Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Song Jian
stressed here today that the development-oriented alleviation of
poverty should not be at the expense of destroying resources and
causing environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the closing session of a three-day
national conference on aid-the-poor through spreading science and
technology, Song said the development-oriented aid to the poor
should stay in line with the principle of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Song, also Minister in charge of the State Science and
Technology Commission (SSTC), said development of the
poverty-stricken areas should focus on the rational and permanent
use of the resources and protecting the environment according to
law.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that for poverty-stricken areas to develop the
economy with outdated technology that consumes large amount of
resources offers no way out.
</P>
<P>
Song said that one major reason for an area's poverty is that
few people there know much about science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Song added that in the past few years, many scientific and
higher learning institutions made much efforts for aid-the-poor
work, saying it was a milestone for Chinese science and technology
circles.
</P>
<P>
The official called on more scientists and technicians to be
engaged in poverty alleviation work.
</P>
<P>
The State Science and Technology Commission today cited 457
scientists and technicians who have made outstanding achievements
in poverty eradication. Of those people, more than 300 won awards
of the Chun Hwa Foundation for Eradication of Poverty by Science
and Technology or Wang Yixi Foundation awards.
</P>
<P>
The Chun Hwa Foundation is jointly established by the SSTC,
Society of Hong Kong Scholars, K.C. Wang Foundation, EPSON
Foundation and Asia Agriculture Foundation in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yixi Foundation for Eradication of Poverty by Science and
Technology was established by Wang Yixi, former Director of
Qingdao Flour Machinery Plant.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the foundations are aimed at encouraging
more scientists and technicians to make contributions for China's
poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in the past 10 years, more than
800,000 Chinese scientists and technicians directly participated
in development-oriented aid-the-poor work and they spread nearly
one million items of applied technology in the poverty-stricken
areas.
</P>
<P>
China's poverty-stricken population has decreased from 250
million in 1978 to 58 million so far.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cabinet Gives Green Light For U.S. Land Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government Thursday
approved a bill at a special meeting to give the green light for
the continued land use by the U.S. military forces in Okinawa, a
southern island of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which has been submitted to the parliament, said,
"the leased land, whose formalities of the use right have not been
completed before the end of the expiry, can be used continuously
after the guarantee for compensation is provided."
</P>
<P>
It would also permit the government to continue to use such
land temporarily until a final decision can be made by the
construction minister in case the government fails to obtain the
approval of a prefectural expropriation committee.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government would be illegally occupying the land
in Okinawa if the existing law is not revised, as the May 14
deadline on expiry of leases on private land used for
U.S. military facilities on the island is approaching.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which revised the 1952 expropriation law, was
strongly opposed by the Social Democratic Party and Okinawa
residents.
</P>
<P>
However, the cabinet and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
are determined to revise the bill to legalize the continuous lease
of land by the U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
"We have a responsibility to provide bases and facilities for
the U.S. military as part of the Japanese government's obligation
under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," said Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who had asked parliament to approve the bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which is to be discussed in the House of
Representatives on Friday, is expected to be passed on April 11
and be enacted on April 18, six days before Hashimoto's visit to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 people owning a total of 362,000 square meters of
land in Okinawa had refused to go on leasing land to the
U.S. forces amid the Japanese anti-U.S. sentiments which
heightened after the rape of an Okinawa school girl by three
U.S. servicemen in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 27,000 of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan are
stationed in Okinawa, which accommodates 75 percent of the
U.S. installations in the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Japanese Kansai Business Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met today
with a Japanese Kansai business delegation co-headed by Tetsuro
Kawakami, chairman of the Kansai Economic Federation, and Masafumi
Onishi, chairman of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng extended welcome to the delegation's China trip and
expressed his appreciation to Kansai business circles for their
efforts in advancing the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the normalization of
relations between China and Japan, Li said. In Japan, he noted,
the force standing for Sino-Japanese friendship from generation to
generation so as to effect a healthy and stable development of the
bilateral relations constitutes the main current. So long as both
sides abide by the principles provided in the Sino-Japanese Joint
Statement and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship,
the relations between the two countries would be continuously
improved and developed, Li Peng added.
</P>
<P>
The economic ties and trade between the two countries have been
developing rapidly in recent years, with two-way trade volume so
far exceeding 60 billion U.S. dollars, Li Peng said, hoping that
the good development trend would continue.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng welcomed the delegation to visit and establish economic
links with Chongqing, China's fourth municipality directly under
the Central Government. Japanese businesspeople are welcome to
invest more in China's central and western areas and conduct
economic cooperation there, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng thanked the delegation for its condolences at the
passing away of Deng Xiaoping. The Chinese government would carry
on Deng Xiaoping's will and advance the reform, opening up, and
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Kawakami said the Kansai business circles established economic
links with China in early 1970s and made contributions to the
development of the Japan-China economic cooperation. Kansai
businesspeople wish to continue their efforts in this regard,
Kawakami said.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Foreign Debt Surpasses 100 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign debts totaled
104.5 billion U.S. dollars at the end of 1996, 33.3 percent more
than that of the previous year, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said today.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 figure, exceeding 100 billion dollars for the first
time, represents 21.8 percent of the gross national product (GNP)
in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Given the nation's overseas assets of 69.8 billion dollars at
the end of last year, the central bank said, net foreign debts
reached 34.7 billion dollars, two times more than the 17.1 billion
dollars at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The structure of foreign debts also deteriorated as the ratio
of less-than-one-year debts to total debts went from 43.7 percent
in 1993 up to 53.4 percent in 1994, 57.8 percent in 1995 and 58.2
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Since the nation's current account balance shifted from surplus
to deficit in 1990, the situation of the foreign debts has
aggravated rapidly, a BOK spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea suffered a record current account deficit of 23.7
billion dollars last year and a total 5.6 billion dollars deficit
in the first two months this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank said South Korea's foreign exchange
reserves plunged to 29.2 billion dollars a month ago. The figure
was the smallest since June 1995, when foreign exchange reserves
were only 28.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, a BOK official downplayed any fear of a financial
crisis, noting that "comparing the level of foreign debts with the
nation's basic economic conditions, there is no possibility that a
foreign exchange crisis will take place."

NEW DELHI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Delhi High Court ruled on
Wednesday that no zinc, lead ash and skimmings are allowed to
import from abroad, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The court gave the ruling after hearing a public interest
petition seeking a ban on the import of these "environmentally
hazardous" commodities.
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, the counsel for the petitioners contended
that it was the duty of the state to protect and improve the
environment and public health and provide pollution-free water,
air and environment for the people.
</P>
<P>
He pointed that toxic wastes like zinc and lead ash find their
way into the country from industrialized countries which perceived
this as a cheap way of getting rid of highly noxious wastes
prohibited by their own governments.
</P>
<P>
He said that zinc and lead ash are known to cause lung problems
and disorders of the respiratory tract and are also carcinogenic
(causing cancer) and because of their high solubility, leach
easily into ground water and soil.

development strategy that may help it boost annual production
capacity to 10 million tons by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Experts have explained the strategy as scientific planning and
overall development over four different oil exploration centers

</P>
<P>
The four are: the Liaobei oil exploration center, consisting of
the Jinzhou 20-2 and Jinzhou 9-3 lesser fields; the Liaozhong
center, based on Suizhong 36-1; the Shijiuzhai center, based on
Qinhuangdao 32-6; and a development center that combines the Boxi
and Bozhong oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Exploration since 1985 has proven that the Bohai Gulf abounds
in oil and gas, and oil reserves in the Bohai Oilfield are said to
be 800 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Bohai will use different oil exploration and development
methods according to conditions in the four centers to meet its
goals.
</P>
<P>
Bohai Oil Company was originally set up in Tanggu, in Tianjin,
in October of 1966, and now has 10 billion yuan in fixed assets
and 10,000 employees.

on the basis of mutual respect and equality, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang said at a routine press conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that at the U.N. Human Rights Conference in Geneva, a
motion, raised by the U.S. and some western countries to criticize
China's human rights conditions, is an interference in China's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
There are differences between China and some other countries on
the issue of human rights, he said, adding that these can be
resolved through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some countries should not criticize China
at the Geneva Human Rights Conference publicly and utterly
groundlessly.
</P>
<P>
He said that dialogue and confrontation are exclusive to each
other. Dialogue can reduce and even remove differences, while
confrontation can only make things more complicated.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue between China and other countries will begin if
those parties give up confrontation in the Geneva conference, he
said.

He said China wants to resolve the issue through dialogue and

<HEADLINE> Production Drop Causes Fuel Scarcity in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The drastic drop in the production
of Nigerian refineries has led to fuel scarcity in parts of
Nigeria, particularly Lagos and its environs, over the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
It is nothing to be surprised these days at the sight of an
oil-strained paperboard with the words "Sorry, No Fuel" at the
entrance of many Lagos filling stations.
</P>
<P>
Drivers in the Nigerian commercial center have also got used
to the long queues in the few filling stations that have
on-and-off fuel supply, only with fears that they can hardly find
queues to join.
</P>
<P>
"I'm lucky to get a full tank yesterday after waiting at a
filling station for three hours," said a driver who works for a
Lagos-based Chinese company.
</P>
<P>
"It normally takes more time, and some of my colleagues had
the experience of queuing for a whole night," he said.
</P>
<P>
The short supply of fuel has activated the black market in
parts of Lagos, as it is easy to get fuel at a double price
around some filling stations that have fuel to sell.
</P>
<P>
Relatives and acquaintants of some filling stations staff are
collaborating in the deals.
</P>
<P>
With the arrival of petrol, the staff, while serving drivers
who are usually tired of long-time queuing as usual, also pump
petrol into various plastic containers and carry them to their
friends waiting outside the premise for sale right at the foot of
the wall.
</P>
<P>
Lagos filling stations depend on local petrol marketers that
get delivery from either nearby pumping stations or vessels with
imported product.
</P>
<P>
But until last Saturday, major oil marketers in Lagos only
received 6.4 million liters of the expected 26.5 million liters
of petrol from a vessel of the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC).
</P>
<P>
It could only last till Tuesday, according to today's Daily
Times.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is far from being solved, as we were told to
expect fresh delivery tomorrow (Friday) which may never come,"
said oil marketing officials, quoted by the largest Nigerian
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The current fuel scarcity, in fact, is resulted from the big
decline in the output of the country's refineries, which now can
meet only 43 percent of the national total demand.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the Pipelines and Products Marketing
Company (PPMC), a NNPC subsidiary, supplies from the three
functioning refineries in the country have dropped to 7.74
million liters per day, compared to the national consumption
level of 18 million liters.
</P>
<P>
While production from the 150,000 barrels per day in the new
Port Harcourt Refinery has been halved, output from Kaduna
Refinery has equally dropped from three million to 1.7 million
liters.
</P>
<P>
Lack of funds to embark on maintenance work at the refineries
is responsible for the decline in output.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian government's 1997 budget, 200
million U.S. dollars will be allocated for refinery maintenance
this year. The sum, though short of the 800 million dollars
required, is yet to be released, said NNPC officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the slash in crude oil allocation to domestic
refineries from 300,000 barrels per day to 250,000 barrels has
already created a drop in processing of petroleum products for
national consumption from 18 million liters to 14.5 million.
</P>
<P>
All this indicates that the current fuel shortage in the
country may last longer than expected.

<HEADLINE> China to Unveil Four Refined Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China will soon release four
well-lensed mainstream films nationwide, to compete with Hollywood
imports, and revive the national film industry.
</P>
<P>
Official sources say that overseas movies have dominated
China's film market in recent years, while lack of funds have
hampered Chinese film studio production.
</P>
<P>
The four films to be shown are "Strategic Turning Point", "Red
River Valley", "Days without Hero", and the comedy "My Husband is
a Null".
</P>
<P>
"Strategic Turning Point" is about the life story of the past
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping who led his army into the Dabieshan
Mountains with Liu Bocheng in 1946, and smoothed the way for the
overwhelming victory of the Chinese Communist Party over the
Kuomintang on the Chinese mainland in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The film "Red River Valley" is based on a true story about the
Chinese and Tibetan people who fought against British invaders in
1890.
</P>
<P>
The four movies are considered the best of the 110 Chinese
films produced last year, Wang Gengnian, deputy director of Movie
Bureau of the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official urged more refined films to be produced to
meet the Chinese people's growing demand for more cultural
products.
</P>
<P>
"The films are as good as 'Independence Day' or 'Eraser' in
many aspects except for the tremendous investment in those
American films," film critics said.
</P>
<P>
"What's more important is that the films have what we think are
Chinese qualities," critics added.
</P>
<P>
The films will also help shape China's image in the world film
industry, they said.

<HEADLINE> Service Quality Framework Set for Phone Operators in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government has
set a service quality framework for cellular phone operators in
the country in a bid to reduce consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
Complete data on each operator would be published annually to
give consumers access to the type of quality service, Minister of
Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Leo Moggie said today after
handing over a framework on monitoring service quality for
cellular phone operators.
</P>
<P>
"This is one way to make the operators sensitive to providing
quality service and give consumers a choice among the various
operators as to which they feel comfortable with," he said.
</P>
<P>
The framework was drawn up after consultation with the
operators and would determine the ranking of their service
quality, he said, adding it would be filled up by them and audited
by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
"We received a lot of complaints from consumers... so we want
to have a common framework by which the services could be
standardized," he said.
</P>
<P>
The framework also proposes the establishment of a Center for
Monitoring Service Quality in Telecommunications to coordinate
monitoring of the standards and service quality in that sector.
</P>
<P>
To meet the increasing demand in the telecommunications sector,
Malaysia plans to invest some 5.2 billion U.S dollars in the
sector during the 2001-2005 period.
</P>
<P>
At present, the population-phone ratio is about 16 percent
which is expected to increase to about 25 percent by the year 2000
and further to 30 percent by the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Tops Other Killers In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaria is a major public
health problem in Tanzania as it kills between 76,000 to 134,000
people each year, the local paper "Guardian" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) Manager, Alex
Mwita was quoted as saying that the majority of the deaths
affected children especially those under five years and pregnant
women.
</P>
<P>
"Malaria is also an economic drain to the country", said the
NMCP manager, adding that the impact of malaria on the country in
terms of direct and indirect costs accounted for 34.4 percent of
the GNP.
</P>
<P>
Mwita outlined five causative factors of malaria as: malaria
vectors, the type of parasites and drug resistance, environmental
changes and socio-economic and political factors.
</P>
<P>
He further said the malaria vectors found in Tanzania are
comparably more efficient malaria transmitters because they
prefer to bite man to other animals and are endowed with a longer
life span.
</P>
<P>
The type of malaria parasites existing in Tanzania are mostly
"plasmodium falciparum" which do not only cause severe disease
but are also increasingly becoming resistant to the curative
drugs.
</P>
<P>
On the environmental point of view, malaria has invaded
highland areas as a result of deforestation. People in such areas
have little immunity to malaria.
</P>
<P>
"Construction projects have bred more mosquitoes", according
to Mwita.
</P>
<P>
Social, economic and political factors led to an increase of
malaria due to some important policy decisions which led to the
collapse of the urban malaria control services.
</P>
<P>
However, he said there is a new mood of optimism borne out of
a new but simple technology of impregnating fabrics with
pyrethroid group of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Mwita observed, "research studies done in Tanzania and Gambia
show that the use of nets and other fabrics treated with these
drugs reduces transmission of the disease and the death rate
especially among children".

TOKYO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The leaders and citizens of Japan's
Okinawa Prefecture today expressed indignation at a government
decision to revise a land expropriation law so that compulsory
land leases will be given to the U.S. troops in Japan, according
to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the land law revision bill at a special cabinet
meeting early in the day was "truly a pity," Okinawa Governor
Masahide Ota was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ota called on the Diet (parliament) "to inquire carefully into
the revision in light of the actual conditions in the prefecture
and constitutional principles."
</P>
<P>
Okinawa City Mayor Shusei Arakawa also expressed disappointment
at the cabinet's decision.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hideaki Ikehara, head of a local anti-war landowners
association also criticized Tokyo for having "jettisoned the
constitutional state" with its unilateral action.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the proposed revision bill would allow the
government to continue leasing land for 12 U.S. military
facilities after the May 14 expiry deadline.
</P>
<P>
The bill is expected to be debated by the House of
Representatives next Monday.

CANBERRA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar lost a
quarter of a US cent after US and Japanese investors sold it on
the back of a softer gold price and concern about the short term
direction of the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
The local dollar ended at 78.19 US cents, down from 87.52 at
the previous local close.
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty about the US dollar's direction, another sharp fall

cited as factors contributing to the currency's fall.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank of Australia senior economist Tim Moloney
said the Australian dollar could fall to 76 US cents by end-May as
interest rates look less attractive and the federal budget looms.
</P>
<P>
On cross rates, the Australian dollar ended at 96.14 yen from

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Propose New Law Against Illegal Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Health Minister
Chua Jui Meng said today his ministry is seeking more powers
through a proposed new legislation to enable it to act against
illegal abortion in the country.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment the ministry is fairly limited in action towards
offenses of this nature, unless the powers are enhanced," he said
while commenting on a news report that more pregnant teenagers
were resorting to abortions either through the traditional way or
by medical clinics.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry has no task force to carry out spot checks
on premises suspected of carrying out illegal abortions or the
powers to prosecute those involved, he told reporters after
attending the opening of the first Asian International Congress on
Emergency Medicine here.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Medical Council (MMC), the body governing
doctors' conduct, could only act against complaints, he said,
adding so far the MMC has never taken any disciplinary action
against doctors for illegal abortion.
</P>
<P>
"Quite often doctors themselves when confronted by law say that
they have good reasons on medical conditions that required an
abortion," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his ministry believed that doctors and
medical professionals were not the best people to be enforcers.
</P>
<P>
"The police for instance would be better enforcers as criminal
abortion falls within the Penal Code," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Penal Code only the police could charge suspected
performers of illegal abortions, the minister added.

During his meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjoern
Jagland, Qiao said that Norway was one of the first Western
countries to establish diplomatic ties with China.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation and exchanges between the two countries in
various fields have developed rapidly for the past 40 years and
more since the two countries established diplomatic relations, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state visit to
Norway last year has pushed the bilateral relations to a new level
and the Chinese government and people look forward to the visit to
China by Norwegian King Harald.
</P>
<P>
China and Norway are two different nations and they differ from
each other in some respects, he said, however, this cannot become
an obstacle to the development of friendly relations and
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries could witness the long-term and
stable friendly relations and cooperation through joint efforts
and based on the principles of mutual respect, seeking common
grounds while reserving differences, non-interference in each
other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Prime minister Jagland agreed with Qiao on the current status
of the relations between Norway and China, saying Qiao's visit
shows that the relations between the two countries in political,
economic, scientific and technological and cultural fields have
developed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's rapid economic development has left a deep
impression on Norway and Norway is willing to strengthen its
economic and trade ties with China.

<P>
COLOMBO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Colombo share market is
continuously gaining ground since the beginning of this year,
according to sources for the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the all share price index which began the
year by topping the 600 index point mark and ended the first week
at 603, rose from point-to-point and as at Wednesday this week
stood at 639.4.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive price index which began the year at 897 point had

</P>
<P>
The sources noted that there was a strong demand for blue ship
shares and described the long-term market as being very
attractive.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the strong improvement in the Colombo
bourse was due to corporate earnings in 1997 being above average
and beyond expectations of the business community, the sources
added.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman Reiterates China's Position on Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China hopes Israel will stop the
expansion of Jewish settlement in east Jerusalem and the Middle
East issue will be solved through political negotiations at an
early date, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang told a
press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The increasing tension between Arab nations and Israel,
especially in the Palestine-Israel relations, Shen said, is mainly
caused by Israel's persistence in establishing Jewish settlement
in east Jerusalem, disregarding the opposition from the Arab
countries and the international community.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is deeply concerned and worried about
this matter," the spokesman said, adding that Israel's position
and conduct have resulted in tensions and increased violence in
the region, and have brought the peace process into a difficult
situation.
</P>
<P>
Shen expressed the hope that the Middle East parties concerned
will abide by the relevant UN resolutions and act in accordance
with the principle of "land for peace" to seek a fair and
reasonable solution to the Middle East issue through political
negotiations at an early date.
</P>
<P>
China hopes the Israeli government will cancel the plan to
expand Jewish settlement in east Jerusalem, and try to create a
good environment for the continuous development of the Middle East
peace process, the spokesman reiterated.

<HEADLINE> HK Welcomes US Customs' Decision on HK Garment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the Hong Kong
government today welcomed the United States Customs' decision to
remove, with effect from May 1, the single entry bond requirement
on eight categories of Hong Kong garment products since last June.
</P>
<P>
The single entry bond requirement has led to increased costs
and administrative burden to Hong Kong's trade, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
He said "the Hong Kong government will have an effective system
to deal with the problem of illegal transshipment, particularly
with the series of new initiatives that we have introduced in the
past year."
</P>
<P>
He said, "As part of our efforts against illegal transshipment,
cooperation with trading partners has always been important.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong will continue its efforts in cooperation
with the US and other trading partners to enhance both sides'
effectiveness in the common objective of tackling illegal
transshipment.
</P>
<P>
The US Customs announced on April 2 the outcome of their review
of the additional import measures imposed on certain Hong Kong
garment imports since June 1996.
</P>
<P>
In June 1996, the US Customs imposed a number of additional
import measures on 10 categories of Hong Kong garments, including
dresses, skirts, nightwear, underwear and suits.
</P>
<P>
The measures include additional requirements in import
documentation, the requirement for a single entry bond, and the
requirement for production verification by the US customs in Hong
Kong factories.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has objected to unilateral imposition of the
additional requirements, pointing out that they are applied to the
relevant products only from Hong Kong and are therefore
discriminatory.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM to Visit Kuwait, Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad will visit Kuwait and Bahrain beginning Saturday
to add impetus to bilateral relations between Malaysia and the two
Gulf states, a Foreign Ministry official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The common desire is to develop new avenues for cooperation in
trade and investment and cooperation in third world countries,
Deva Mohamed Ridzam AbdullahIts, under-secretary of the West Asia,
Africa and Organization of Islamic Conference Division of the
ministry, said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Deva said that Mahathir would be in Kuwait for three days at
the invitation of Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh
Saad Al-Abdulla Al-Sabah before leaving for Bahrain for a
three-day visit at the invitation of Bahraini Prime Minister
Sheikh Khalifa bin Sulman Al-Khalifa.
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, Mahathir, who is leading a 15-member official
delegation, will visit the Kuwait Liberation Tower, which is the
world's fourth highest telecommunications tower, and the Seif
Palace, the newly-completed government complex which houses the
offices of the state's Emir, the prime minister and the cabinet,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is expected to sign a double taxation avoidance
agreement with Kuwait during a bilateral meeting scheduled on the
second day of the visit.
</P>
<P>
Deva said Malaysia, which established relations with Kuwait in
1975, had since signed economic and technical cooperation,
cultural and scientific, investment guarantee, trade and air
services agreements with the state.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Airways flew twice a week to Kuala Lumpur but
temporarily terminated its service last year due to shortage of
aircraft while Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flew to Kuwait as a
stopover en route to London but suspended its flights because of
the Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is Malaysia's fifth largest trading partner in West Asia
after the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan.
Bilateral trade between Malaysia and Kuwait amounted to 296
million ringgit (about 118.4 million U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
In Bahrain, apart from a bilateral meeting, Mahathir will also
deliver a keynote address at the Gulf Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain has a highly developed tourism industry. "This offers a
good opportunity for Malaysian banks and the tourism sector in
Malaysia," said Deva.
</P>
<P>
Total trade between Malaysia and Bahrain amounted to about 100
million ringgit (about 40 million dollars) last year with
Malaysia's exports valued at 54 million ringgit (about 21.6
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Bahrain signed an economic and technical
cooperation agreement and a cultural and scientific cooperation
agreement in 1975 and an air services agreement in 1994, with Gulf
Air flying twice a week to Kuala Lumpur, but MAS no.

some unions of doctors and nurses, to protest against the plan of
Prime Minister Alain Juppe on social security reforms.
</P>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Agricultural Minister
Abida Hussain today called on the government to increase the
budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
"The agricultural sector contributes 24 percent to the national
income whereas it receives less than 5 percent of the development
expenditure each year," said Abida at the "Conference on Pakistani
Agriculture" opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Successive governments have treated enhancement of agricultural
production as a bureaucratic exercise of fixing targets without
achieving any meaningful result, she said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, our country, which once called the food granary
of the sub-continent has become a net food importer with a
shrinking export surplus," she said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the yields of all major crops have stagnated and
the leading sources of growth have shifted from crops to livestock
and horticultural crops, she said.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase the agricultural productivity and
production, she said, the government should take effective
measures to protect cultivated land, to renovate irrigation system
and to enhance the agricultural research.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural conference, brought together thousands of
farmer delegates across the country, aims to spell out a dynamic
development strategy for Pakistan's agricultural sector.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Doctors Stage 48-Hour Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Doctors at state-run hospitals
in the government-controlled part of Cyprus started a 48-hour
strike this morning in demand for higher salary and pension
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The strike was decided Wednesday by the civil servants trade
union (PASYDY), of which the public hospital doctors are its
members.
</P>
<P>
The PASYDY announced that the strike is caused by a deadlock
in the process to meet the doctors' demands.
</P>
<P>
The union, however, said inpatients as well as
life-threatening cases in hospitals will be treated by a skeleton
staff.
</P>
<P>
PASYDY Secretary General Glafcos Hadjipetrou said Wednesday
that the union decided to proceed with the strike because the
Ministry of Health refused to resume with doctors the dialogue
aimed at reaching a solution.
</P>
<P>
Public hospital doctors went on a 24-hour warning strike on
March 13.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the PASYDY, Health Minister Manolis
Christofides described the strike measures as "the worst
choice", and said their demands are unlikely to be met under the
pressure of the strike.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Artists Discuss Reform of Peking Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A number of Shanghai artists say
that the 200-year-old Peking Opera must be reformed if it is to
survive.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar this month, they criticized some artists for
sticking to old methods and being unwilling to appeal to modern
tastes.
</P>
<P>
Although Beijing was the birthplace of the opera, a delicate
combination of lyrics, music, and acrobatics, Shanghai developed
its own school by changing the opera's original style early in
this century.
</P>
<P>
"The experience of the Shanghai school should be examined,"
said Guo Hancheng, a noted artist, adding, "The nation as a whole
should learn from the Shanghai artists' spirit of exploration and
creativity."
</P>
<P>
Peking Opera faces challenges from modern forms of
entertainment like television and dance, and younger audiences
have drifted away from theater. Some Beijing-based Peking Opera
troupes receive government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
However, while Beijing theaters stagnate, many Shanghai Peking
Opera theaters are flourishing. One reason is that the Shanghai
artists have injected new concepts into the old opera to reflect
modern themes.
</P>
<P>
"The key point is to build a bridge across the gap between the
traditional and modern arts," Guo explained. Artists suggested
that the creation of new repertoires, a reform of management, and
promoting the opera on a commercial scale be emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Grasslands in China Enjoy Promising Development Prospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China's grasslands, the total area
of which ranks second in the world after Australia, are playing a
better part in boosting local economy and improving the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China has 400 million ha of
natural grasslands which cover two-fifths of the country's land
area, and three-quarters of which are located in pastoral areas.
</P>
<P>
The grasslands in northern and western China are the major
pastoral areas, which mainly accommodate Mongolian, Tibetan, and
Kazak ethnic peoples. For generations, the ethnic groups have been
relying on the grasslands to raise livestock.
</P>
<P>
Now that the central government has decided to step up economic
growth in the country's central and western areas, the grasslands
will boom even more, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic animals such as cattle and sheep mainly live on
grass. In this sense, a large amount of grain can be saved.
Sources with the Ministry of Agriculture said that even though
China's grain production achieves 500 million tons by year 2000,
there will be a want of 60 million tons of feed.
</P>
<P>
The development of animal husbandry can ease the burden of
grain shortage, the sources said. In 1995, the production of
cattle and sheep meat was 6.17 million tons, which equals to about
26 million tons of grain.
</P>
<P>
Grasslands also act as a large vegetation coverage curbing the
spread of deserts. In recent years, the dry-up in some stretches
of the Yellow River, and black windstorms in Xinjiang, Gansu,
Inner Mongolia, and Liaoning are believed to be related to the
deterioration of grasslands.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from the 1990s, the central government has been
putting more money in protecting and improving the grasslands.
Since 1995, the State Planning Commission has set aside 50 million
yuan (six million US dollars) a year to carry out pilot
development projects in the pastoral areas in northern China,
doubling the central government's investment in the sector.

SHENZHEN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The overseas financial sector in
Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone, has become a
regular part of the city's financial system.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 billion US dollars has been channeled into the
city's industries by overseas bank branches since 1987. In 1996
alone, they brought in 2.45 billion US dollars, accounting for
more than half of the influx of overseas capital.

<P>
They have also provided financial innovations, giving Shenzhen
offshore financial services, Automatic Teller Machine services,

</P>
<P>
In 1982, the first overseas bank branch was opened in the
special economic zone. Since then, assets of overseas financial

<HEADLINE> Forestry Vital to Human Existence: Lawmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The importance of forestry should
be understood as not only preserving the environment, but human
existence, a senior Chinese lawmaker said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Economic and social development calls for our attention and
concrete efforts to protect the forest reserves, and the
conditions for human existence," said Wang Binqian, vice-chairman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
He issued the call at a conference on starting a inspection
campaign on the compliance of the country's Forest Law organized
by the top legislature, the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Three groups will be sent to Jiangxi, Fujian and Yunnan
provinces in a few days. Other provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities are asked to conduct self-examinations and to
submit reports to the NPC.
</P>
<P>
"Environment and development are issues of common concern in
the world, and the World Conference on Environment and Development
in 1992 declared that forestry conservation is the key issue of
the environment," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has paid great attention to the forestry
development and has taken a series of measures, one of which is
the promulgation and enforcement of the Forestry Law in 1984 and
1985.
</P>
<P>
The law has played an important role in protecting, developing,
and making rational use of forest reserves, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 12 provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities have greened all their barren hills and wastelands
suitable for growing trees.
</P>
<P>
China's forest area has increased from 115 million ha in the
early 1980s to the current 133.7 million ha; timber stock volume,
from 10.26 billion cubic meters to 11.785 billion cubic meters;
and forest coverage rate, from 12 percent to 13.92 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country has increased both forest area and timber stock
volume, while worldwide forest resources are declining.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang pointed out that China remains a country short of
forest. It faces serious ecological problems such as the shortage
of forest resources, serious water and soil erosion,
desertification, shortage of water, frequent occurrence of floods,
droughts, typhoons, and other disasters.
</P>
<P>
All those problems indicate that the ecological condition in
China has posed a major bottle-neck factor for the country's
economic and social development, the senior legislator said.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister of Forestry Xu Youfang, the country's per
capita forest area and forest stock volume are only 15 percent and
12 percent of the world level, and forest coverage rate per head
is no more than half of the world level.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 18.7 percent of the national land, or 1.794 million
square kilometers, is suffering from soil erosion; direct economic
losses resulted from natural disasters exceed 200 billion yuan a
year.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the law enforcement inspection efforts aim to sum up
experiences, seek solutions to problems, and to promote the forest
renewal.
</P>
<P>
"This has not only shown our attention to environment and
development, it is also one of the most important realistic
measures to solve the problems," Wang added.

<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of women officials in
China was 13.28 million by the end of last year, almost 200 times
the number in 1949, when modern China was founded.
</P>
<P>
Women officials now account for 38.8 percent of the Chinese
officials, sources from the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF)
say, and in 31 municipalities, provinces, and autonomous regions
there are women in provincial level positions.
</P>
<P>
There are women in all county leading bodies across China and
women constitute over half of China's villages and towns in 15
municipalities, provinces, and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Enrollments of school-age girls reached 98.63 percent in 1996,
1.65 percentage points higher than in 1992. During the Eighth
Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) period, an additional 1.1 million women
gained literacy and 96 million women got practical technological
training.
</P>
<P>
The ACWF source says she attributes the progress to the Law on
the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests which went into
effect on October 1, 1992.
</P>
<P>
"Women's living and working conditions have improved
distinctly since governments at all levels fully protected women's
rights and interests in accordance with laws," the source says.
</P>
<P>
Women's right to work was further guaranteed when an additional
1.7 million women were employed from 1992 to 1995, increasing the
number of women workers to 57.55 million by 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, comprehensive social security has provided
over one million women workers with maternity subsidies and
medical costs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, governments at various levels have been cracking down
on the abduction and selling of women and children and on
prostitution. Crimes in violation of women's rights are coming
under control, the source said.

<HEADLINE> New Railway Spurs Development in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIHAI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nanning-Kunming Railway, the
rail artery in southwest China that went into operation last
month, has brought new opportunities to the development of the
coastal area in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The new railway will demand that the cargo handling volume of
Fangcheng Port, the region's largest, to grow two million tons

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Set up Crime Research Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
scheduled to establish a crime research center following
increasing incidents of crime in country.
</P>
<P>
In a Kenya Gazette supplement, Kenyan Attorney-General Amos
Wako published the National Crime Research Center Bill to be
tabled to the current session of the parliament for enactment.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the center will evaluate causes and
come up with preventive measures to the crimes which are
threatening the security of the society and to life and property
of the people.
</P>
<P>
The center will also serve as a centralized source of
information to agencies of government responsible for the
administration of criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
It will disseminate its research findings through mass media
with a view to enhancing the awareness of related agencies and
the community on crime prevention and the rehabilitation of
criminal offenders.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, the Kenyan police set up a mobile unit with
modern equipment to combat escalating crimes like armed robberies
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new unit is using specially designed land rovers and act
as a special rapid deployment force to preempt car thefts, bank
robberies and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
The mobile unit is being deployed in Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu,
Nakuru, Eldoret, Kiambu and Thika, and in bandit-prone areas in
the east African country.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Motorola Paging Products
Co. Ltd., US-based Motorola Corp.'s first joint venture in China
went into operation on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Younts, executive president of Motorola Corp., said
that his company will transfer more technologies, accelerate the
localization of staff, and improve the local content ratio in
cooperation with Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, clinched between Motorola and Shanghai
Wireless Telecom Equipment Manufacture Co., is designed to produce
high-speed paging products with an annual capacity of 750,000
units.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said China's paging market witnessed sharp
expansion in recent years. Only the country's post and telecom
authorities offered paging services for more than 20 million
subscribers. An additional six to ten million users are expected
to apply for the paging services this year. In Shanghai, the post
and telecom authorities-run paging stations now have developed
900,000 users. Other paging stations have another 900,000 users.
</P>
<P>
Motorola is now one of the major foreign investors in
China. The company's accumulated investment since 1978 has
totalled 1.2 billion US dollars. The Motorola Electronic (China)
Ltd. had been among China's top ten foreign-funded enterprises in
terms of investment volume and foreign exchange earnings back in
1994.

<HEADLINE> China's New Measure To Protect Intellectual Property Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China will adopt a new measure to
protect the intellectual property rights, according to Song Jian,
state councillor and minister in charge of the State Science and
Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
Song said at a national conference in Beijing today that the
measure is meant to improve Chinese products' competitive ability
on the international market. He explained that the number of
patents applied for by all Chinese enterprises in a year is
smaller than that for even one big foreign company.
</P>
<P>
Some well-known Chinese trademarks are even registered for
patents by foreigners, he noted, and therefore, "We are losing a
great share of the international market."
</P>
<P>
The high-profile conference has selected 45 enterprises and
institutes fo an experiment where the government helps them set up
special IPR affairs departments, create IPR protection networks,
and build a self-protection system.
</P>
<P>
These 45 include major oil and chemical corporations, computer
companies, and prestigious universities and scientific research
institutes for whom IPR are especially important.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the measures signal a beginning of
activities that raise IPR protection in China to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the country has adopted many measures to
crack down on copyright piracy, including the closing of
commercial video halls nationwide, checks on the market,
promulgating more laws, and sending more culprits to jail.
</P>
<P>
The most noteworthy event was the seizing of 29 underground CD
production lines in Guangdong province recently. Those who
provided tips in the case were given a reward of 300,000 yuan
(37,000 US dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
All the crackdowns have benefited foreign business interests,
said Shen Rengan, deputy director of the State Copyright
Administration, adding that the main purpose of China's IPR
protection, in fact, is boosting its own industry, science, and
culture.
</P>
<P>
"In the planned economy, it was not important for a company to
protect its IPR, because all resources and products were
controlled by the state," noted Xu Guanhua, deputy minister of the
State Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
"But in the market economy, IPR protection has become a
strategic issue for a company, and an urgent problem faced by the
country, which is seeking to be a part of the international
scene," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in 1996 Chinese enterprises and
institutes applied for 25,126 patents. In some high-technology
fields, such as electronics, medicine, communications, and the
chemical and aerospace industries, foreign patent applications
account for as much as 80 or even 90 percent of the total number
of applications in China.
</P>
<P>
And, in the past 10 years, Chinese companies have applied for
only 2,000 patents in foreign countries.

than half a century in exile, local daily "The Citizen" quoted
his secretariat as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
As the Albanian government had authorized his return, Leka I
could return when he likes, a representative of the Johannesburg
based court said.
</P>
<P>
However, no precise date had yet been fixed for King Leka to
go home, the unidentified representative said.
</P>

Minister Bashkim Fino.
</P>
<P>
King Leka inherited the Albanian crown in 1961 on the death of
his father King Zog I, who was proclaimed king in 1928, 16 years
after the former Ottoman province became autonomous.
</P>
<P>
The monarch, who has lived in England, France and Spain, moved

YANTAI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-backed enterprises in
Yantai, a coastal city in east China's Shandong Province, are
providing greater backing for economic development.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a Daewoo-backed joint automobile parts venture has
started, bringing the total number of multi-national companies
investing in Yantai to 32. The venture will be be completed at a
total cost of 1.2 billion US dollars.

</P>
<P>
Overseas investment has helped the city build a group of

textiles, automobiles, building materials, and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of industrial profits in Yantai last year came from
local foreign-funded enterprises, which contributed two-thirds to

</P>
<P>
In addition, foreign investors have shown a growing interest in
funding local projects in agriculture, energy, transportation,
tourism, real estate, and development of marine resources.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cabinet Gives Green Light For U.S. Land Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government Thursday
approved a bill at a special meeting to give the green light for
the continued land use by the U.S. military forces in Okinawa, a
southern island of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which has been submitted to the parliament, said,
"the leased land, whose formalities of the use right have not been
completed before the end of the expiry, can be used continuously
after the guarantee for compensation is provided."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government would be illegally occupying the land
in Okinawa if the existing law is not revised, as the May 14
deadline on expiry of leases on private land used for
U.S. military facilities on the island is approaching.
</P>
<P>
The bill was strongly opposed by the Social Democratic Party
and Okinawa residents.
</P>
<P>
However, the cabinet and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
are determined to revise the bill, which is to legalize the
continuous lease of land by the U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
"We have a responsibility to provide bases and facilities for
the U.S. military as part of the Japanese government's obligation
under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," said Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who had asked parliament to approve the bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which is to be discussed in the House of
Representatives on Friday, is expected to be passed on April 11
and be enacted on April 18, six days before Hashimoto's visit to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 landowners in Okinawa had refused to go on leasing
land to the U.S. forces under the Japanese anti-U.S. sentiments,
which was heightened after the rape of an Okinawa school girl by
three U.S. servicemen in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 27,000 of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan are in
Okinawa, which accommodates 75 percent of the U.S. installations
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Attempts to Divide Tibet Will Fail: Tibetan Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A group of Tibetan sociologists has
denounced the collaboration of Taiwan authorities with the Dalai
Lama and his followers in their attempt to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Puncog Cering, president of the Tibetan Academy of Social
Sciences, said that although Taiwan authorities held to the
position that Tibet is an inseparable part of China for more than
four decades, Taiwan's present leadership, since coming to power,
has not only voiced support for the Dalai Lama's so-called
"five-point peaceful plan" for achieving "independence of Tibet",
but has openly invited the Dalai Lama to Taiwan and has approved
the institution of an office in Taiwan for the Dalai Lama's clique.
</P>
<P>
"Under the disguise of religion and culture," he noted, "the
Taiwan authorities and the Dalai Lama's clique have increased
their collusion, but it is actually a last-ditch, vain attempt by
separatists on the eve of Hong Kong's return to the motherland."
</P>
<P>
"Their plot to split the motherland will never succeed," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Xini Cering, deputy director of the Academy's Research
Institute on Religion, cited the Dalai Lama as the chieftain of
the old Tibetan regime, which combined political and religious
authorities.
</P>
<P>
"It is a well-known fact that during his reign, Tibet was a
backwater area in terms of science, technology, culture, and
education, and the serfs there had no personal freedom to speak
of," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Since the Dalai Lama's attempt to split the nation was thwarted
in 1959, the religious scholar said, the Dalai Lama has all along
engaged in separatist activities, and "What he actually wants is
to bring serfdom back to Tibet."
</P>
<P>
He added that the collaboration of Taiwan authorities with
the Dalai Lama's clique is in fact one of backers of "Taiwan
independence" and backers of "Tibetan independence", and that
their goal is the separation of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In the more than 40 years since the peaceful liberation of
Tibet, especially in the 18 years since China adopted its reform
and opening-up policies, experts said, the emancipated serfs have
seen great social and economic development, and an improvement in
their standard of living.
</P>
<P>
"The Tibetan people are in firm opposition to activities by the
Taiwan authorities and the Dalai clique to sabotage national
unity, which go against the tide of history," the experts said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Spells out Investment Goals for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
today that it has spelled out its investment goals for 1997, which
aim to achieve a 17 percent increase in investment over last year.
</P>
<P>
Investments in the Philippines last year rose to 490 billion
pesos (18.6 billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 20 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The government attributed the increase to the favorable
investment climate in the country and the surging economy, which
grew 6.8 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here today, the government said that
with more domestic and foreign investment this year, it will try
to "spread prosperity, disperse industry in the countryside,
enhance global competitiveness of the nation's agriculture and
industry, increase exports, open up opportunities for small and
medium enterprises and build up infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
It said that this year's investment priorities plan contains 32
areas of preferred economic activities, including export
industries, manufacturing, agriculture, food and forestry,
textiles, chemical products, infrastructure development,
environment protection and mining, it said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 32 areas, the government said, 28 are carried over from
the 1996 plan. The four new inclusions are feeds production, pulp
and paper, book publishing and fish production, it said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pressing Israel to Suspend Har Homa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
pressing Israel to suspend the controversial Har Homa housing
project as a good-will gesture to salvage the peace process,
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli sources as saying that Israel had
received information that the U.S. government would ask Israel
to freeze the Har Homa construction for six months in order
to rebuild confidence between Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, now working to restart the
stalled peace talks, is expected to put forward the demand
to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu during the latter's
visit to Washington next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of the Clinton-Netanyahu summit are
finding ways to ease the current tension and violence so to
resume the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. But Israel expects
the summit to focus on its demand on the PNA's long-term
commitment to fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department has denied that Clinton
was arranging a three-way summit between Clinton. Netanyahu and
PNA President Yasser Arafat. The announcement was made in
reaction to the statements by Arafat's spokesman Marwan Kanafani
which confirmed that Washington was making efforts to arrange
a three-way summit.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu dismissed Wednesday that notion that the U.S.
government had called him to Washington in order to pressure
him to make gestures or concessions. He stressed there was a
"deep understanding" between Israel and the U.S. on "the
crucial need to reestablish the war against terrorism and the
need for the PNA to keep its commitments."
</P>
<P>
During his brief stay in Washington, Netanyahu is also
scheduled to hold talks with Jordanian King Hussein who is
currently on an official visit.
</P>
<P>
The monarch continued criticizing Netanyahu's policies for
threatening to torpedo the peace process, despite the tragedy
occurring last month near the Israeli-Jordanian border, in which
a Jordanian soldier killed seven Israeli schoolgirls and wounded
six others. Israel blamed the incident on the king's harsh
criticism of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Israel is reportedly proposing moving the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process into the "fast track" on the final-status talks,
which it hopes to conclude within six months instead of two
years. But the Palestinian side is deeply suspicious about the
Israeli initiative, citing the lack of its trust on the
Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, the final-status talks, which will
tackle the most difficult issues of final borders, status of
Jerusalem and fate of Palestinian refugees, should be concluded
by May 1999.

<HEADLINE> Most Israelis Reportedly Support Founding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A majority of Jewish Israelis
support the establishment of a Palestinian state, reported The
Jerusalem Post today, quoting a Tel Aviv University survey as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The poll also indicated that an even larger majority believe
the chances of another Arab-Israeli war are very high.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether they support the establishment of a Palestinian
state, if this removed the main obstacle to a real peace between
the Israelis and the Palestinians, 51.3 percent of them said
yes, 44.2 percent said no, and 4.5 percent were non-commital.
</P>
<P>
The telephone poll of 503 Jewish adults, conducted Sunday,
is believed to have a margin of error of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other results show an 8-percent drop in the opinion that the
peace process will bear fruit, and a 6-percent decrease in those
who support the Oslo process (from 54.1 percent to 48 percent).
</P>
<P>
Some 36 percent said they do not believe there is a strong
probability of war between Israel and the Arabs, while 59
percent said the chances are very high.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-four percent said they are concerned about the
possibility that they or their families might become victims of
terrorist attacks, while 26 percent are not worried.
</P>
<P>
On the internal front, the support for a national unity
government is on the increase. About 61 percent back the idea.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted against the background of a deepening
crisis over Israeli-Arab relations stemming from the Israeli
construction of a new Jewish settlement at Har Homa in East
Jerusalem, a section regarded by the Palestinians as the capital
of the future Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Former PAC President Makwetu to Face Disciplinary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Pan Africanist
Congress (PAC) president Clarence Makwetu is to appear before an
internal disciplinary committee in Pretoria on three charges of
violating the party's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Senior PAC member Magole Mphahlele will act as prosecutor in
the hearing. The disciplinary committee will be headed by an
Eastern Cape attorney and several other party members, reported a
local newspaper "The Star".
</P>
<P>
Makwetu, now PAC's national chairman, had indicated that he
would call several witnesses at the hearing, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The charges relate to allegations that Makwetu had divided the
party, created factions and had violated the PAC's oath of
allegiance.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu lost the presidency to former Methodist Bishop Stanley
Mogoba at the PAC's national conference in Northern Province last
December.
</P>
<P>
However, Makwetu's supporters claim the elections were
unconstitutional and have refused to recognize the party's new
leadership, thus causing an internal strife and rival factions.

<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China has formed a meteorological
service network in the Three Gorges Dam construction area to
provide timely information on hydrology surveys, forecasts, and
meteorological data for the gigantic water control project on the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Three Gorges Project Development
Corporation explains that the area is disaster-prone in its
weather and the construction is in many areas, so it is of great
importance that timely and accurate forecasts be available.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the company has built seven water
level reporting stations, two hydrological stations, and one
meteorological observation station in the dam construction area.
</P>
<P>
The company also continues to add stations in the construction
area according to the speed of construction and analysis of
meteorological materials, and has installed 23 machines to monitor
weather in major construction sites.
</P>
<P>
Related departments have also made forecasts according to
demands of construction teams and offered round-the-clock
consultation service.
</P>
<P>
The official attributes the smooth work on the three Gorges
project partly to the high quality of the services by all
departments concerned, and notes that the project has already
survived thunderstorms and torrential rains since construction
work began.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Retail Sector To Remain Prosperous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the leading commercial
center in China, will enjoy a steady retail market in the second
quarter of this year, according to local government predictions.
</P>
<P>
They say that the improving macro-economic environment and
increased buying power mean that sales will increase during the
period.
</P>
<P>
The local government says that increasing fixed assets
investment, an improved investment structure, and an increased
sales to production ratio indicate a favorable environment.
</P>
<P>
Investment in fixed assets amounted to nearly 9.9 billion yuan
during the first two months of this year, up 44 percent from the
same period in 1996, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 new supermarkets opened in the first three months,
bringing the number of such markets to more than 820. In addition
to large supermarkets, various chain stores in residential areas
are likely to become a new driving force behind commercial
development.
</P>
<P>
With the improved economic climate, purchasing power has
increased. Salary increased at the beginning of the year, and
government policies for re-employment improved incomes.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's special position as a commercial city will also mean
many visitors from other parts of the country and the world, which
will stimulate the retail market.
</P>
<P>
The local government also pointed to some disadvantages, such
as changing consumer trends in the bond and stock market, and poor
performance of traditional industries.

<HEADLINE> Bright Prospect Predicted for Sino-Polish Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A Beijing-based Polish diplomat
predicts great potential for continual growth in Sino-Polish
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In an article published on the Economic and Trade Briefs of the
Embassy Association, Dr. Janusz Fajkowski, the commercial
counsellor of the Polish embassy, said great changes have occured
in bilateral economic ties in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The 340-million-dollar export credit agreement signed between
Poland and China last year, he pointed out, has facilitated the
export of Polish goods to China.
</P>
<P>
In terms of conventions, Dr. Fajkowski added, bilateral
economic ties have already had a solid foundation, "with a series
of agreements at different levels connecting Poland and China."
</P>
<P>
The counsellor pointed out that direct investment in each
country remains limited, however.
</P>
<P>
"Poland has found important, prospective, and interested
economic partners in China," he noted, "while China also views
Poland as a market for future expansion, which may serve as a base
for extension to the European Union market and other eastern
European countries."
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that both Polish and Chinese businesses have
increasing interest in launching joint ventures, and the
operations of Polish businesses are extending from traditional
commercial centers like Shanghai and Guangzhou to other coastal
cities, and central and western China with relatively less
competition.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 and 1996, six Chinese provinces and one autonomous
region established cooperative ties with Polish counterparts, to
promote economic cooperation between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Thai Foreign Ministers Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen and Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn
welcomed today the promotion of mutual trust, comprehensive
contacts, and cooperation in various fields among the countries in
this region.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that every country's affairs should be decided
independently, and regional affairs should be handled through
consultations at an equal footing by countries in the region,
adding that the outer world should respect the choices made by
countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China always holds that problems and disputes
existing between countries should be settled properly through
peaceful negotiations. Prachuab agreed with and welcomed this.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers spoke highly of the role of the
ASEAN's regional forum in enhancing mutual trust among countries
in the region and safeguarding regional security.
</P>
<P>
They said they hoped to strengthen exchanges and cooperation
within the framework of the ASEAN's regional forum, so as to make
concerted efforts to maintain the lasting peace and stability of
the region.
</P>
<P>
On Asia-Europe meeting, Qian said that both the first
Asia-Europe meeting held in Bangkok one year ago and the
Asia-Europe foreign ministers' meeting held in Singapore recently
had achieved positive results.
</P>
<P>
Hoping that momentum will continue, Qian said that Asian and
European countries can conduct exchanges and dialogs, on the basis
of equality and mutual respect, on many aspects at the Asia-Europe
meeting, while the emphasis still should be put on economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Prachuab said Thailand agrees with China's attitude toward the
Asia-Europe meeting, adding that Thailand and China can further
cooperate in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Briefing each other on their foreign relations, the two foreign
ministers reached common understanding on facilitating personnel
exchanges between Hong Kong and Thailand after Hong Kong's return
to the motherland, on bilateral cooperation in cracking down on
international crimes and drug trafficking, and on shipping
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Prachuab is here accompanying Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh on a China visit.
</P>
<P>
This morning, trade, communications, industries and mining
ministers of China and Thailand held talks respectively.

<HEADLINE> East China's No Chimney Industrial Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- East China's Wuxi New Area, in the
suburb of Jiangsu Province's booming Wuxi City, has an industrial
park without a chimney.
</P>
<P>
"Keep our sky blue, and say farewell to chimneys!" is a slogan
of the new area government.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the industrial park in 1992, the
area has attached great importance to environmental protection,
and refused nearly one billion US dollars of foreign investment
because of pollution problems, according to the head of the local
environment department.
</P>
<P>
The park has spent some 200 million yuan (about 25 million
dollars) in a heat and power plant, and equipped it with advanced
gas and dust treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
In early 1995, the park began to provide heat and power for
enterprises, and many foreign-funded firms dismantled their own
boilers.
</P>
<P>
The park, with some 200 overseas-backed enterprises and an
annual output value of 10 billion yuan, has met the top government
standard in combating air pollution, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the local government has spent three million yuan
in a sewage discharge system, and will invest some 150 million
yuan in the construction of a large waste water treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
"A clean environment is an advantage in attracting investment,"
said Ding Puren, a leading official of the new area government,
holding that environment cannot be sacrificed for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"One important reason for our investment in the park is that it
has a clean environment, and the local government's efforts to
combat pollution has enhanced our confidence for the future here,"
said a Swedish investor who established a factory in the park
three years ago with an investment of 18 million dollars, and has
decided to invest another 30 million dollars.

<P>
KAMPALA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A combined forces of about 500
Ugandan rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and defeated
Zairean troops entered western Uganda, local newspaper "The
Crusader" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a military intelligence source in Kampala, the report
said the combined forces headed last weekend for Kyabitondo
County in Kasese District, a former hideout of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
A security official confirmed the entry of the combined forces
but could not determine the number of the forces.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda army in the district also established camps in the
area on April 1.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean soldiers were said to be a part of unit defeated
by Banyamulenge rebels in Bukira, eastern Zaire. The ADF had a
big camp in Bukira.
</P>
<P>
This is the second reported case that defeated Zairean
soldiers joined Ugandan ADF rebels. On March 25, some 200
defeated Zairean soldiers joined ADF in western Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The ADF had some 1,000 soldiers in its ranks last November.
But the Ugandan army had annihilated its main forces later. ADF
remnants since then divided into some small groups scattered in
the west and south-west.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Soccer Players Escape Punishment over Drug Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Three players from Saudi
Arabia who failed drug tests at the Asian Cup last December will
not be disciplined, Asian Football Confederation (AFC) general
secretary Peter Velappan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Velappan said the International Football Federation (FIFA) had
decided not to ban the players, despite the positive tests,
because of "discrepancies in the execution of the doping control."
</P>
<P>
But the Asian governing body still issued a "stern" warning to
all member countries about drug taking.
</P>
<P>
The three players, who have not been named, were among four
Saudis tested after the semi-finals and final of the Cup in the
United Arab Emirates. The Saudis won the final after a penalty
shootout with the hosts.
</P>
<P>
The AFC had originally said four players failed tests.
</P>
<P>
News that no action would be taken came only hours after Saudi
Arabia were named Asian football team of the year at the AFC's
annual awards.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan, co-host of the 2002
World Cup finals, lost a bid to secure a seat on the International
Football Federation executive here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Japan Football Association president Saburo Kawabuchi was
beaten by four votes by Worawi Makudi of Thailand in an Asian
Football Confederation (AFC) election for Asia's fourth seat on
the world governing body executive.
</P>
<P>
It was another major defeat for Japan in football power
broking. Not even the support of FIFA vice president Chung Mong
Joon and his Korean counterparts could get the seat for
Kawabuchi. Japan and South Korea, longtime sporting rivals, are
jointly hosting the 2002 finals.
</P>
<P>
Worawi won the backing of Southeast Asian nations which held 10
of the 38 votes at the AFC special congress. With support from
Arab nations, the Thai football chief won by 21 votes to 17.
</P>
<P>
The seat Worawi won will become vacant again at the FIFA
congress in France next June and Japan has said it will be looking
to win it then.
</P>
<P>
Other elections saw China's Zhang Jilong replace deceased
compatriot Xu Fang as an AFC vice president. Iraq defeated Hong
Kong and Iran to gain a seat on the AFC executive.

TIRANA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Albania's Socialist Party, the
country's largest opposition party, today decided to return to
parliament which it had boycotted since July last year.

The current 140-seat parliament was established last July. The
ruling party, the Democratic Party, held 122 seats, while the
Socialist Party had 10, with the remaining eight seats shared
by the other three small parties.
</P>
<P>
However, the Socialist Party has never recognized the
parliament's legality, accusing the Democratic Party of
manipulating parliamentary elections.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Mt. Anak Krakatau Erupts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Mount Anak Krakatau in the Sunda
Strait, Indonesia, about 300 kilometers west of Jakarta, has been
spewing volcanic ash and rocks for the past few days, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
Gede Suantika, an official of the Meteorology and Geophysics
Agency, said Wednesday that the 200-meter volcano's activity began
to subside at 2:00 p.m. Wednesday but advised that people should
stay away.
</P>
<P>
Anak Krakatau was formed beneath the Sunda strait in 1927 on
the same fault line as Mount Krakatau, which erupted in 1883
creating tidal waves that killed most of the 36,000 people in the
eruption.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, Mt. Anak Krakatau had erupted every hour in the
past few days and can be heard from Merak Beach, Labuan and
Pandeglang in West Java as well as Kalianca and coastal areas in
Lampung.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities had issued warnings to visitors and
fishermen, telling them not to land at Anak Krakatau or come
within a five-kilometer radius.
</P>
<P>
Meteorology and geophysics officials have warned that the
current level of activity may continue for months.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, activity at Krakatau prompted the authorities to put
the volcano off limits to tourists and climbers for several
months.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for Protection of Kanchenjunga Ecosystem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Environmental experts from
Nepal, India and China have called on their governments to prepare
groundwork to declare the Kanchenjunga mountain ecosystem as a
protected area by 2000, a press release said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release issued by the World Wildlife
Fund (WWF) Nepal Program, participants at a three-day workshop on
the "Conservation of the Kanchenjunga Ecosystem" concluding here
Wednesday urged each of the countries to devise policies and
projects to conserve, maintain and enrich the ecological,
socio-cultural and economic integrity in the area.
</P>
<P>
The 8,568-meter Mt. Kanchenjunga, the third highest in the
world, is located in the border area of Nepal, India and China.
</P>
<P>
About 20 experts including government officials and
environmentalists from the three countries took part in the
workshop jointly organized by the WWF and the Kathmandu-based
International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD).
</P>
<P>
The participants called for the establishment of a Kanchenjunga
Mountain Ecosystem Forum involving officials and experts of the
three countries by November this year to give "greater momentum to
ongoing efforts".
</P>
<P>
They also recommended to hold a regional planning workshop by
March 1998 to identify ways of developing and documenting
information regarding the proposed protected area, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
Rich in habitat and botanical diversity, the Kanchenjunga
region is also home to several endangered wildlife species like
the snow leopard, musk deer and Himalayan black bear, according to
the WWF press release.

<HEADLINE> HK to Send 51 Athletes to East Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is to send 51 athletes
to the Second East Asian Games slated for May 10-19 in Pusan,
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Amateur Sports Federation and Olympic Committee
(ASF&AMP;OC) has come to a decision on the list which includes 28
males and 23 females for the Games.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong athletes are split for eight sports at the event
-- four for athletics, one for diving, 13 for swimming, eight for
Wushu, 10 for badminton, four for judo, four for gymnastics, five
for rowing and two for bowling.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ASF&AMP;OC had earlier dropped football from the
Games team, citing that the Hong Kong team was not good enough for
the event.
</P>
<P>
But the Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA) said that the
tough domestic schedule made Hong Kong's team's trip to South
Korea impossible.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed it with the ASF&AMP;OC and decided that we should set
our target on the Asian Games (next year in Bangkok, Thailand),"
said HKFA chairman Victor Hui Chun-fui on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The HKFA has decided not to dissolve the Hong Kong team after
its final World Cup qualifying match against South Korea on May 20
and Hui hoped the team's head coach Kwok Ka-ming stay with the
team for long-term training.
</P>
<P>
Kwok's contract expires after the match.
</P>
<P>
Most of the players in the team, except the older ones as they
would be too old, will kept for the Asian Games, Hui said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Airlines Not Allowed Access to Indian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- India will not allow foreign
airlines to hold equity directly or indirectly in any domestic
airline, The Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made by the cabinet on Tuesday, has effectively
sealed the fate of a 23 billion rupee (about 657 million U.S.
dollars) joint venture between India's famous Tata company and
Singapore Airline which had proposed to start a domestic airline
in India.
</P>
<P>
The controversial joint venture project, proposed as early as
in February 1995, envisaged induction of seven new aircraft in the
first year of operation and gradually going up to a fleet of 19
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal received strong opposition from the Indian
Civil Aviation Ministry which insisted that foreign airlines
should not be allowed to hold any stake in any domestic airline.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Arrest Accused Involved in Share Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Some teams of police have been sent
to arrest the persons sued by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), for manipulation as well as fraudulent acts in
securities trading that led to the recent crash in the capital
market of Dhaka, police sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, the SEC, regulator of Bangladesh's
capital market, has filed criminal cases against 42 persons of 15
listed companies and brokerage firms on charges of manipulating
share prices through fraudulent means during a bull run last year.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General K S Nabi and M Zahir, counsel for the SEC,
filed the cases with the chief metropolitan magistrate's court on
the basis of a report by a committee that probed the biggest ever
share market scam in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the big issuers and share dealers-brokers
including the stock exchange leaders were involved in manipulating
shares during August to December last year.
</P>
<P>
The all share price index in the Dhaka Stock Exchange, which
was 959.05 on June 30, 1996, soared to 3627.01 on November 16,
1996. Experts smelt foulplay by a section of market operators and
sponsors of listed companies.
</P>
<P>
The report said, however, the stock exchange authority did not
take any measure to cool the overheated market because some of the
bourses' leaders themselves were engaged in such fraudulent
activities.
</P>
<P>
The accused include the chief of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE)
Imtiaz Hossain and former DSE chairman and present councilor
Khurshid Alam.
</P>
<P>
Starting from December last year, the DSE share price index
slid to a low of 1070 points at the end of a bearish trend. It
rallied back this week and the index Wednesday was slightly up
ending at 1225.49 points.
</P>
<P>
According to the DSE sources, trading at the DSE is likely to
be held as usual today although cases were filed against some of
the important dealers and brokers of the bourse.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SEC Chairman Haroonur Rashid Wednesday said that the
commission would seek maximum punishment for those responsible for
the happenings in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The government's action against the companies and brokers
responsible for the fraudulent acts would restore the confidence
of investors and help maintain normal trend and stability in the
share market, he hoped.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Cocoa Beans Export Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam exported more than 138,000
tons of cocoa beans in the first three months this year, an
increase of 80 percent above the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The country now has over 200,000 hectares of cocoa which
yielded some 300,000 tons of cocoa beans in the 1996-97 season,
or 40,000 tons higher than the previous season.
</P>
<P>
In the 1995-96 crop, the Vietnam Coffee Corporation (VCC)
exported 240,000 tons of cocoa beans, earning over 460 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet approved a VCC plan
aimed at growing 40,000 more hectares of arabica cocoa as part of
an effort to increase the total acreage of cocoa to 260,000 ha,
and harvest 350,000-400,000 tons of cocoa beans by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
An additional cocoa area will be allocated to northern highland
provinces with an investment of 78 million U.S. dollars, part of
which will come from a loan provided by the French Development
Fund.

<HEADLINE> San Miguel Internationalizes Soft Drinks Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- San Miguel Corporation of the
Philippines announced here today that it has reached an agreement
in principle to combine its soft drinks interests with those of
Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCA) of Australia in a transaction valued
at about 2.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This move offers San Miguel a magnificent opportunity to
advance its internationalization program," said Andres Soriano,
chairman and chief executive officer of San Miguel, at a press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
"In one dynamic step, we are able to expand the horizon of our
soft drink business from the Philippine domestic market to the
international arena through an anchor bottler spanning three
continents. This will also open up career opportunities for our
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Soriano said that his company will combine its 70 percent-owned
subsidiary, Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc (CCBPI), with CCA,
one of the Coca-Cola Company's largest anchor bottlers outside the
United States, and become its second largest shareholder with a
shareholding of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Coca-Cola Company, which owns 30 percent of CCBPI, will
remain CCA's largest shareholder at 33 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the proposed transaction, Soriano said, CCA
will issue 293 million ordinary shares worth about 2.7 billion
dollars based on an average of CCA's share price for the month of
March. San Miguel will receive shares worth about 1.9 billion
dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
San Miguel is the Philippines' largest beverage, food and
packing company with consolidated net sales of 3.2 billion dollars
and net income of 232 million dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> China Exports Ostriches to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua)-- Twenty-one African ostriches were
exported by Beijing recently to the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK), where they will be bred.
</P>
<P>
The ostriches came from the Shoujia Ostrich Breeding Farm in
Shunyi, a suburb of the Chinese capital, which will be responsible
for technical training of the DPRK developers.
</P>
<P>
The ostrich, a native of Africa, is a cash crop because the
price of the meat is 10 times that of beef, and the skin can sell
for more than 1,000 US dollars apiece, because of its softness and
beauty.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons for ostriches' world-wide popularity among
livestock raisers are the thickness of the meat, the long
life-span, and the rapid breeding.
</P>
<P>
Ostrich-breeding for commercial purposes in China began in the
late 1980s and has developed quickly since then. There are
currently more than 400 ostrich-raising companies in 21 provinces,
municipalities, and autonomous regions that are raising around
60,000 birds in all. In the Shoujia Ostrich Breeding Farm, the
biggest of its kind in north China, there will be over 1500
ostriches by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Strong Earthquakes Rock Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April (Xinhua) -- Two separate strong earthquakes shook
three of Japan's four main islands early thursday and at least
four people were injured in the stronger one, Japan's
Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The first earthquake, measuring 5.5 on the open-ended Richter
scale, occurred at 4:33 a.m. (1933 GMT Wednesday) in Kagoshima
prefecture on Japan's southernmost main island of Kyushu, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which was centered about 10 kilometers deep in the
prefecture's Satsuma region, was also felt in the neighboring
Miyazaki and Kumamoto prefectures.
</P>
<P>
The tremor injured at least four people and caused landslides
at 14 locations, damaged roads at three locations and five
buildings in Kagoshima Prefecture, local authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The second quake, measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale, came at
6:47 a.m. (2147 GMT Wednesday). It jolted Ehime Prefecture on
Shikoku Island, the smallest of Japan's four main islands, Oita
Prefecture on Kyushu as well as several locations in the Chugoku
region on the biggest main island of Honshu.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages from the
second quake, police said.
</P>
<P>
Japan, one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries, has
experienced moderate to strong tremors in recent weeks on the Izu
Peninsula, southwest of Tokyo, in Aichi Prefecture and neighboring
prefectures in central Japan, and on the southern Kyushu Island.

BRASILIA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Strikers Romario and Ronaldo
scored two goals each as world champions Brazil thrashed Chile
4-0 in a soccer friendly here on Wednesday.
</P>

Chile only managed to keep their goal intact until the eighth

<P>
Romario, who led Brazil to the world trophy in 1994 World Cup,
scored his first goal since his return to the national team in the
40th minute.
</P>
<P>
Brazil was awarded a dubious penalty goal less than 24 minutes
later when Ronaldo, voted world's best player of the year 1996,
went crashing down in the penalty area after an insignificant tug
on his shirt by a defender. Ronaldo himself converted the penalty.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, Romario scored his second to wrap up the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Foreigners Seek Property Bargains in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors are hunting for
bargains in Thailand's slumping property market.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has been facing a property depression for about three
years now, and cash-strapped Thai developers are offering
discounts for their properties.
</P>
<P>
Thai developers lack cash flow because they cannot sell units
as a result of oversupply.
</P>
<P>
Developers are also facing difficulty securing more loans to
complete construction because of the Bank of Thailand's credit
squeeze on the property sector.
</P>
<P>
The depressed property sector has become a burden to the
country's commercial banks and finance firms, as developers are
unable to repay their loans.
</P>
<P>
Average property prices in Thailand are now 20 percent to 30
percent below the levels seen at the peak of the property boom
four or five years ago, according to an executive of real-estate
consultants Colliers Jardine.
</P>
<P>
Normally, property investors expect returns of about 12
percent. But in Thailand a more realistic rate would now be 7
percent to 8 percent for the office, residential and retail
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors, in particular Singaporeans and Malaysians,
consider now a good time to enter Thailand's property market.
</P>
<P>
Most foreign investors realize the current situation and are
investing for the long term, after they calculate the capital
gains, added value from their properties and risk and returns on
purchases.
</P>
<P>
The most attractive area for foreigners is serviced apartments,
for which demand is outpacing supply. Offshore investors will buy
Thai properties through joint ventures with Thai partners.
</P>
<P>
The attractiveness of serviced apartments is due to the
increase in long-term demand for accommodations for foreign
executives who work in Thailand. And the flow of more foreign
investment to Thailand means that more such residential units are
needed.
</P>
<P>
There are two types of potential investors: individuals who
will buy one to five units, and others who want to buy whole
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Institutional investors and large listed firms from Singapore
and Malaysia are looking for office spaces in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The average office vacancy rate is 18 percent in the central
business district and 24 percent in the suburbs.

<HEADLINE> South Asian Nations Agree on Sub-Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Four South Asian countries
agreed to form an expert group to further study the priorities of
the proposed sub-regional cooperation at the conclusion of a
one-day foreign secretary level meeting held here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign secretaries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal held
preliminary discussions on the projects which would be further
studied later on the costs and benefits, according to the Nepali
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The areas of cooperation between the four countries would be
determined in line with the study report expected to come out
after the expert group's meeting in July this year, Nepali Foreign
Secretary Kumar Prasad Gyawali told a press conference on
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Foreign secretaries of the four countries said the sub-regional
cooperation, known as the South Asian Growth Quadrangle, would not
overshadow the cooperation under the seven-nation South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and expressed their
respective governments' commitment to SAARC activities.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Farooq said the concept of the
four-nation sub-regional cooperation is in pursuit of SAARC policy
under which two or more SAARC countries can work together for
mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
The concept of sub-regional cooperation was raised by Nepali
Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani in New Delhi at a meeting
of SAARC council of ministers last December.
</P>
<P>
Lohani proposed that the four South Asian countries in the
sub-region enhance their cooperation in areas like hydro-power,
transport, trade, transit, tourism and communications.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Imports of French wine by Thailand
posted 375,126 cases (about 3.4 million liters) last year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics by the Excise Department of the Thai
Finance Ministry, the United States exported 291,885 cases (about
2.6 million liters) of wine to Thailand, ranking second, followed
by Australia which sell 157,518 cases to Thailand in the year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand imported over one million cases (about 9 million
liters) of wine in 1996, up 96 percent from 1995, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
Local wine dealers said that sales of cheap wine are expected
to rise this year as it is becoming more popular in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Wine from the US, Australia and Chile is expected to take a
larger share of the Thai wine market as these countries generally
produce middle- and low-priced wine, they added.

<HEADLINE> Price Growth Slows in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Prices of goods and services in
Vietnam grew 2.1 percent in the first quarter of this year, the
lowest growth rate for many years, Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister
Phan Van Khai said here today.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that although the country's social and economic
development continued improving in the first few months of the
year, signs of a slowdown were being seen in manufacturing and
business activities in some sectors, particularly the processing
industry.
</P>
<P>
Khai was speaking at today's opening of the 11th and final
session of the country's Ninth National Assembly (parliament) to
review the country's socio-economic development, defense, security
and external relations.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Khai said that the country had managed to
overcome the consequences of last year's floods and storms.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the Mekong River delta provinces have started
harvesting the winter-spring rice crop which is expected to be a
bumper one.
</P>
<P>
He said industrial output grew 14 percent in the first quarter
of this year compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose 22.5 percent to 1.79 billion U.S. dollars,
with exports of foreign invested enterprises soaring 83.9 percent
to 160 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the past three months rose a more modest 10.7
percent to 2.72 billion U.S. dollars over the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But Khai warned that the trade deficit was rising quickly and
had already exceeded the "safety level."
</P>
<P>
He said the slow disbursement of investment funds for
capital construction from both the state budget and foreign loans
delayed several development projects.
</P>
<P>
Reforms of the state apparatus in general and of the
administrative and state-owned economic sectors in particular were
also slow, Khai added.

<HEADLINE> Albania's Opposition Decides to Return to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Albania's Socialist Party, the
country's largest opposition party, today decided to return to
parliament which it had boycotted since July last year.
</P>
<P>
Namik Kokli, member of the presidium of the Socialist Party,
told reporters that his party made the decision as a show of
support for the national reconciliation government under current
difficult situations, so as to contribute to the country's
recovering from chaos and crisis.
</P>
<P>
The current 140-seat parliament was established last July. The
ruling party, the Democratic Party, held 122 seats, while the
Socialist Party had 10, with three seats going to other parties.
</P>
<P>
However, the Socialist Party has never recognized the
parliament's legality, accusing the Democratic Party of
manipulating parliamentary elections.

<HEADLINE> Financial Crisis in Bulgaria Easing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria witnessed decreasing
inflation, stability of its foreign exchange rate and improvement
in the financial situation of its banks in past month.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian caretaker Minister of Finance Svetoslav Gavriski told
a press conference today he attributed the healthy development of
the country's macro-economy to the great efforts by the caretaker
government.
</P>
<P>
Taking advice from the International Monetary Fund, the
caretaker government asked the banks to work out and introduce
financial policies suitable to themselves, Gavriski said.
</P>
<P>
This led to the steady increase in the value of the Bulgarian
Lev against some main foreign currencies, he said, adding that
the financial crisis caused by the devaluation of Lev and high
inflation was now under control.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the caretaker Financial Ministry showed the
selling prices of some imported items were going down because of
the stable exchange rate between the Lev and certain foreign
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prices of medicines and petrol had decreased by 50
percent and 10 percent respectively. Prices of meat and milk had
also lowered.
</P>
<P>
Since the banks adjusted their financial policies, the State
Bank of Bulgaria has bought 150 million U.S. dollars from the
foreign exchange market, increasing the country's foreign
currency reserves, the ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
The previous Bulgarian prime minister, Zhan Videnov, resigned at the
end of last year. Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov appointed
Setfan Sofianski as caretaker prime minister and the tenure of the
caretaker government is three months.

ATHENS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
today agreed to grant 80 million U.S. dollars in urgent economic
assistance to Albania to help the crisis-ridden country out of
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Simitis made the decision while meeting his Albanian
counterpart, Bashkim Fino, who arrived earlier today for a two-day
official visit.
</P>
<P>
Simitis also reaffirmed Athens' commitment to grant a 20
billion drachmas (about 76.9 million dollars) loan to Tirana, and
to send technical assistance to Albania to assist with the conduct
of elections in June.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the issue of Greek advisory and
technical assistance for the restructuring of Albania's army and
police forces.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Fino hailed Greek-Albanian relations as
"excellent."

700-strong Greek contingent to Albania, as part of the
5,000-strong multinational force to protect the humanitarian
relief operations which will last three months in Albania.

Fino was appointed earlier this year to head a unity government
after armed unrest in southern Albania. He had talked with Greek
President Costis Stephanopoulos.

</P>
<P>
Jan Graf de Marchand et d'Ansemburg, who led an 11-member

heading for Italy last week in which some 80 people are estimated
to have died, will not affect the EU's relations with Albania.

KIEV, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will hold to the One-China
policy and will not set up official links with Taiwan, Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma said here today.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo,

<HEADLINE> Thailand Encourages Merger of Finance Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has
introduced a package of incentives for finance companies to merge
and increase the stability and competitiveness of the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Firms interested in merging can apply to the central bank
immediately, according to a senior official of the bank today.
</P>
<P>
The incentives include eligibility for new retail banking
operations, such as the ability to accept passbook savings
deposits and run foreign exchange operations, as well as
permission to expand branch networks.
</P>
<P>
To qualify, the group must have a lead firm composed of one to
three companies with a combined net capital of 3 billion baht (120
million US dollars) and net assets of 30 billion baht (1.2 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The central bank also announced Wednesday that finance
companies that merge and need to rebuild their capital through
foreign participation above the 25 percent shareholding limit will
be favorably considered on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
Policy makers believe that increased financial stability will
not only boost investor interest and spur stock prices, but also
ease depositor worries, leading to reduced costs.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Rerngchai Marakanond said firms which
decline to merge or boost capital would face tighter restrictions
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the new move amounts to a handout of incentives
to more than 90 finance companies generally considered
second-class financial institutions due to the narrower scope of
their financial services compared with commercial banks. The
finance companies, which are barred from providing checking
account services, trade financing and foreign exchange, are
suffering bad debts in loan portfolios incurred from ventures into
high-risk businesses.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Finance Ministry is also examining
other measures which would encourage financial institutions to
shift away from relying on short-term foreign capital to fund
domestic activities, which can lead to problems of maturity
mismatches.

<HEADLINE> Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra Director Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The director of the Vienna
Philharmonic Orchestra, Professor Werner Resel, resigned tonight,
leaving the world-famous orchestra "headless".
</P>
<P>
Resel refused to elaborate on why, except to say it was for
personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
A cellist himself, Resel had held the post since 1987. He
became a member of the National Opera Theatre of Austria in 1959.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, founded in 1842 and famous
for its annual New Year's concert, is a private association and
its members play at the publicly-funded Vienna State Opera.
</P>
<P>
It was an all-male orchestra until early this year when, under
heavy pressure from the government and vehement attacks from
feminist groups, it began to admit female members.
</P>
<P>
Resel had been reluctant to let in women members to the
orchestra. His aide, Deputy Director Clemens Hellsberg, will take
care of the orchestra's business until a new director is elected.

<HEADLINE> Italian Troops Won't Avoid Albania South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini today denied reports that Italy will avoid sending troops to
rebel-held southern Albania because of anti-Italian sentiment
following the sinking of a refugee boat.
</P>
<P>
He said details of the deployment of the multinational
protection force (MPF) were yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) envoy to Albania, former
Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitsky, Dini said "signals" here on
Tuesday indicated that "Italian troops would be welcomed to the
south."
</P>
<P>
Anti-Italy sentiment reportly flared in the south after an
Albanian refugee boat collided with an Italian navy ship and sank
in the Adriatic Sea on Friday night. There are four dead and 83
people missing.
</P>
<P>
There have been expressions of strong resentment against Italy
especially in the southern port of Vlore, from where the ill-fated
boat left. People have threatened to shoot any Italian troops who
come as part of the force.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the rebel salvation committee in Vlore
said today it was keen for Italy to send troops and they would run
no risks.
</P>
<P>
Dini said decisions on deployment of the 5,000-strong MPF will
be made later today at the meeting of 70 military representatives
and diplomats from 10 countries ready to contribute troops.
</P>
<P>
Italy is expected to provide 2,000 to 2,500 troops, France
1,000, Greece 700, Spain 500, Turkey 500 and Romania 400.
</P>
<P>
The troops will be headed by 57-year-old Italian General
Luciano Forlani, at present the commander of the third armored
corps based in Milan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Tirana, the Albanian government renewed its call
for the force to be sent as soon as possible, and in any event no
later than April 12.
</P>
<P>
Facing criticism from opposition parties that the MPF will put
Italian soldiers in danger, Italian Defense Minister, Beniamino
Andreatta, replied today that Italian servicemen would only be
used on logistical duties in areas that were completely calm.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not envisage the force undertaking police
operations, but simply securing access to the troubled Balkan
country and defending supply routes.

<HEADLINE> More MNLF Members to Join MILF Rebels in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 members of the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF) have defected to another rebel
group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) since the MNLF
singed a peace agreement with the Philippine government last
September.
</P>
<P>
Business World, a local newspaper, reported today that some
7,000 more MNLF members are expected to follow their disillusioned
comrades soon. However, the reports need to be confirmed by the
MNLF or the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted MILF vice-chairman for political affairs
Ghadzali Jaafar as saying that many members of the MNLF are
discouraged because the economic development in Mindanao promised
by the government has yet to be realized.
</P>
<P>
According to the MILF, many MNLF members are turning to the
MILF because they "do not believe" that the peace agreement is the
real solution to the problems of the Moro people.
</P>
<P>
In its peace talks, the MILF has repeatedly asked the
government to consider giving the Moro people an independent state
in Mindanao. The MNLF also made the same demand, but dropped it
later to reach a peace agreement with the government.
</P>
<P>
As a result, an estimated 10,000 members of the MNLF from all
over Mindanao have changed sides and transferred to the MILF, the
newspaper said, adding that 7,000 more have informally indicated
their intention to cross over to the MILF.
</P>
<P>
Since the MNLF has made peace with the government, the MILF
claimed that it is now the biggest rebel group with 350,000 troops
in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said if the reports are confirmed, it would be a
great setback to the peace process in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos was reportedly worried over
the defection and have instructed all government agencies to
expedite other programs to attend to the needs of the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the MNLF. The government is
now pursuing low-level talks with it, but the talks were sometimes
stalled by sporadic fighting between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Number of Collectors In China on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- North China's Tianjin
municipality, which is said to have 400,000 collectors, has come
to have one of the largest collections of collectors in China.
</P>
<P>
As could be seen in a recent exhibition, the objects of their
affection include an exotic array of cigarette packages, post
cards, cards of scenic spots, porcelain, types of make-up used in
traditional operas, leather silhouettes, rare stones, coins,
rubbings, and foreign clocks and watches.
</P>
<P>
The most eye-catching exhibit was perhaps the 1.3 m-by-3.3 m
picture made of more than 20,000 rare fish bones that were
collected by an over 60-year-old local retiree, Zhao Gang.
</P>
<P>
The fish bones were used to make two large dragons, four small
dragons, and a floral ball, and 12 Chinese characters which mean
"unity, reunification", "descendants of heavenly dragon' and "the
motherland's reunification".
</P>
<P>
Some 100 blue and white porcelain pots with designs made by
famous painters and calligraphers were on display, as part of 40
types of exhibits from 46 local collectors.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Moslem Community Supports Arab League's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Moslem community fully
supports the Arab League's recent decision to freeze all its
activities designed to normalize ties with Israel as punishment
for the latter's action in building a new settlement in East
Jerusalem, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Lukman Harun, chairman of the Indonesian Committee for World's
Islamic Solidarity, said here Tuesday that the league's decision
was a correct answer to the Jewish state's arrogance in completely
ignoring the message of the world opinion that it should withdraw
from the territories it was occupying.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time since the United Nations issued its
resolutions calling on Israel to withdraw from the occupied
territories, including East Jerusalem, but the Jewish state kept
ignoring them," local press today quoted Harun as saying.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the Arab League on Monday wound up a
two-day meeting in Cairo with a call for a freeze on efforts at
normalizing ties with Israel to punish the Jewish state for
building a new settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to Harun, the Israeli actions could be considered as
a proof that the Zionist nation was against peace.

SHANGHAI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The first non-smokers association
sponsored by college students was set up at Shanghai Medical
Sciences University in east China's Shanghai municipality recently.
</P>
<P>
The university, which was the first to prohibit smoking on
campus, last April, has established rules and regulations to ban
smoking on campus, such as banning cigarette sales on campus and
listing non-smoking as a basis for awards.
</P>
<P>
Only 17.38 percent of faculty members and 3.1 percent of the
students say they smoke at the university, in contrast to the
former 21.8 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The association has made a written proposal for college
students across the country and sponsored activities promoting
non-smoking.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, more than 80 percent of young men in
Shanghai spend from 10 to 20 percent of their salaries on
cigarettes. In China, 500,000 people die of smoking-related
ailments every year.

ZHENGZHOU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan province,
one of the country's major electric power producers, plans to use
10 billion yuan in foreign funds in the next five years for its

Seven projects have been approved by the province and
preparation for another eight is under way.

According to a high-ranking local official, the province will
give priority to power production rather than power sources.
</P>
<P>
The province has used approximately three billion US dollars in
foreign funds in its power development so far through 13
cooperation projects. In addition to the foreign funds, Henan
increased cooperation with domestic financiers, and it got 650
million yuan from commercial banks and companies last year.

<HEADLINE> First Group of Scholars Sent Abroad by Reformed System Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars who were sent
abroad for further training returned home, showing the
effectiveness of the reformed policy.
</P>
<P>
Seven of 10 scholars who finished their studies abroad kept
their promise by returning home on schedule, with another two
people ready to return with booked air tickets in hands, said an
official from the China Scholarship Council (CSC), a non-profit
institution established last June to take over the State Education
Commission's tasks of handling affairs related to overseas studies.
</P>
<P>
China began to reform its way of sending scholars abroad for
academic research and exchanges two years ago. Northeast China's
Jilin and east China's Jiangsu provinces took the lead in
reforming the old method in an experimental way.
</P>
<P>
The reform, introduced nationwide one year later, offers
opportunity to those who want to study abroad with the state
financial support. They can submit a personal application and go
through a selection procedure by a panel of relevant experts.
</P>
<P>
If selected, they must sign an agreement with the government to
pledge to return home after completing their overseas studies.
</P>
<P>
The two provinces selected 86 people to study abroad. And the
10 people of them are the first group to return as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The CSC official said that those who break the agreement have
an extra period of two months to make a yes-or-no decision. If
they choose not to come back, the CSC will deal with the matter
according to the agreement. The earnest money they deposit in a
bank will be fined and their guarantors will be investigated and
affixed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
He said CSC is taking management of overseas scholars as a
major task this year as scholars abroad are lining up to come back
home.
</P>
<P>
The CSC has granted about 1,500 applicants with further
training or research opportunities abroad last year. It is now
open for applications for another 1,500 opportunities. This year's
selection work is expected to be completed in late August.
</P>
<P>
About 270,000 Chinese have gone abroad for advanced training
since 1978 when late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping advocated
sending more people overseas to study. Over 120,000 of them were
sponsored by the State or their work units, with the remainder
self-supporting.
</P>
<P>
Some 90,000 of these people have completed their overseas study
and returned.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Signs Oil Cooperation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan National Congress
approved today the signing of a cooperation agreement between a
Venezuelan oil company and three United States companies involving
an investment of about 3.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, for the production, transport and refining of
extra heavy crude oil, was signed by Corpoven, a subsidiary of
Petroleos de Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. companies are Atlantic Richfield Co. (ARCO), Texaco
Inc. and the Philips Petroleum Company.
</P>
<P>
The four companies will produce improved oil and other products
from the refining process in the Hamaca area of the Orinoco oil
fields.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation aims to develop reserves of crude oil deposits
in an economic way, and take advantage of the apparent growing
demand for crude oil in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Corpoven says about 3.5 billion dollars will be invested in
camp facilities, drilling, transportation and the improvement of
crude oil. Daily production will be 195,000 barrels of extra heavy
oil.
</P>
<P>
The product will be piped to the refining plant to be installed
in a complex in the northern part of the Anzoategui state.
</P>
<P>
The three U.S. oil companies will own 70 percent share of the
stocks and Corpoven 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Trade Increases Between Chinese Hainan And Taiwan Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The volume of trade between south
China's Hainan Province and Taiwan last year grew 37.5 percent
over 1995, as a result of increasing cooperation in the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Farm produce and sideline products accounted for the majority
of Hainan's exports to Taiwan. According to customs statistics,
the trade volume registered 33.99 million US dollars last year,
14.5 million in imports and 19.49 million in exports.
</P>
<P>
The year's growth was 37.5 percent for the total trade volume,
35.3 percent for imports, and 38.4 percent for exports, much
higher than overall growth of Hainan's trade in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Some 57 percent of the export volume, 11.14 million US dollars
worth, was in aquatic products, vegetables and tea, most from
Taiwan-backed agricultural projects.
</P>
<P>
And 46 percent of the imports were machinery and electric
machinery, most of which were imported by Taiwan-backed businesses
as a part of their investment.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the actual trade volume between Hainan and
Taiwan is much larger than the official figures, because many
exports to Hong Kong ultimately go to Taiwan. They predict future
increases in trade because of preferential policies in tariffs and
taxes Hainan has as a special economic zone, and expanding
Taiwanese investment in Hainan and Hainan's potential in
processing with its rich natural resources and low land and labor
costs.
</P>
<P>
They say that direct sea and air links should be established
between Hainan and Taiwan to fuel development.

LISBON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese police seized a total of
6,218 kilograms of narcotics in 1996 and arrested 3,724 people
suspected of drug trafficking, a police report said today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the drugs included 811.5 kilograms of cocaine,
46.7 kilograms of heroin and 5,324 kilograms of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
Among the drug-trafficking-related suspects, 449 were
foreigners and 2,926 were Portuguese drug addicts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier police reports show that drug users in Portugal have
exceeded 100,000 at present, making Portugal one of the leading
countries in the European Union with the largest number of drug
users.
</P>
<P>
The number is still on the rise with a growing population of
young drug addicts, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese government has launched an anti-drug campaign
while beefing up anti-drug measures.
</P>
<P>
Due to its location on the Iberian peninsula between the
Atlantic Ocean and the European continent, Portugal has been an
easy way for drug trafficking from other parts of the world to
Europe.

Co., one of the country's major tire producers, to increase
revenues from 3.5 billion yuan to more than 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to one local official, the scope of cooperation was
widened last year from the industrial and commercial sector to
finance, scientific research, agriculture, tourism and education.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Jinjiang Hotel Management Group used its expertise
in 34 hotels and eight other properties across the country.
</P>
<P>
Profit is not the only goal of the cooperation. Last year the
city worked with Yunnan in poverty relief in the economically
backward province in southwest China. Shanghai has signed
contracts and letters of intent with Yunnan worth 2.5 billion yuan
in different fields, including industry, agriculture, and foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
It has also spent 300 million yuan on Three Gorges Dam-related
projects.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is also taking advantage of its unique status in
China's opening drive. Some 1,996 enterprises funded by investors
out of Shanghai settled in the city last year. The registered
capital of these ventures totalled 3.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some 220 machine-building enterprises and financial
institutions across the country formed the China Pufa Corporation,
headquartered in Shanghai's Pudong New Area, with assets of more
than one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The First Auto Works, the country's largest automobile
manufacturer in northeast China's Jilin Province, has spent 150
million yuan on a plant capable of producing 6,000 Red Flag
mid-luxury sedans in Nanhui County, one of Shanghai's suburban
counties. The auto group signed another 12 letters of intent for
an investment of 250 million yuan with the county.

<HEADLINE> France Beats Sweden in Soccer Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A questionable foul led to the only
score by Youri Djorkaeff helped France for a unconvincing 1-0 win
over Sweden in a soccer friendly here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There were few opportunities for either team in the first
half. Although France had the majority of play on the Swedish
side of the field, French goalie Fabien Barthez made the two major
stops of the first half, getting in front of two headed shots by
Swedes.
</P>
<P>
Just when it would appear to be a scoreless first half, France
scored.
</P>
<P>
In the 44th minute, Djorkaeff evaded the defense and was
approached by Thomas Ravelli, the Swedish goalie, in the penalty
area.
</P>
<P>
Although TV replays showed Djorkaeff making a late fall with
Ravelli not touching him, the Belgian referee, Marnix Sandra,
awarded Djorkaeff a penalty which he converted for his 14th
international goal for France.
</P>
<P>
In the second half Christophe Dugarry made Ravelli dive to stop
a shot in the 55th minute. Franck Gava, who came into the game a
little after, made Ravelli work with a direct shot on goal minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the half was on equal terms with neither goalie
being really threatened.
</P>
<P>
The last time Sweden beat France was in 1969.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Argentina Reach Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and Argentina today
reached an agreement which could end the trade dispute between the
two countries generated by Brazil's import restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro
Malan and visiting Argentine Economy Minister Roque Fernandez, who
arrived here today for the talks of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The move is believed to benefit only Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay, Brazil's three parters in the Southern Common
Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the imports made by any one of the
Mercosur partners will not have to be paid in cash after clearing
customs. payment must be guaranteed by the central banks of each
country through reciprocal credit agreements which allow the
signatory countries having a "current account" to pay the
difference at the end of each four-month period.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Brazilian government announced restrictions on
the financing of imports in order to reduce its trade
deficit. Under the restrictions, importers would have to pay for
all of imported goods immediately.
</P>
<P>
The measure would affect 65 percent of the Brazilian imports
and would also harm the interests of Argentina, uruguay and
paraguay.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay expressed
their strong opposition to the Brazilian decision.
</P>
<P>
Chile and Bolivia, both associate members of the trade bloc, are
expected to have talks with Brazil on the same issue.

</P>
<P>
Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn said that after discussions
with President Arpad Goncz and all political parties, his

</P>
<P>
He said it would create a bad precedent for the international
community to go in to solve a country's internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to U.N military intervention, he said, the
multinational force could not guarantee its own security in
lawless Albania and so it was pointless risking Hungarian
servicemen's lives there.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last Friday authorized the dispatch
of a 2,500-strong Italian-led multinational force for three months
to protect relief operations and help the return to stability and
order in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Albania has repeatedly asked for foreign military assistance
since massive protests, sparked by the collapse of pyramid savings
schemes, turned into armed violence last month. More than 150
people have been killed in the unrest.

<P>
MANILA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine and Swiss
governments are negotiating for a bilateral tax treaty to
eliminate double taxation and encourage investments between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Public Economic Minister Jean Pascal Delamuraz, head of a
trade delegation which just ends a three-day visit to the country,
said the double taxation appeared to hinder the flow of Swiss
investments into the Philippines, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said that profits generated from investments should be taxed
only once, stressing that the proposed tax deal would help attract
investments and level the playing field for Swiss investors.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland now has existing double taxation agreements with
most countries in the Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Andres Leuenberger, president of the Swiss Federation of
Commerce and Industry, added that many Swiss firms were eyeing
investments in the Philippines, particularly in infrastructure and
engineering projects under the build-operate-transfer
arrangements.

<P>
WARSAW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Italy played to a 0-0 draw against
Poland in a European World Cup qualifying group two match in
Chorzow on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Italy had more possession and showed more skill than the Poles,
but failed to turn that into scoring chances. Poland chased and
harried the 1994 World Cup finalists but never looked like
breaching the Italian defence.
</P>
<P>
Italy now lead England by four points before the qualifying
action re-starts at the end of the month, and remain favourites to
get the only automatic place in the 1998 finals in France.

<HEADLINE> Horner Beaten in British Squash Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Suzanne Horner, sixth seed at the
British Open, was unexpectedly crashed out of the tournament in
Cardiff on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Horner was beaten by England international Linda Charman 9-3,
9-3, 8-10, 5-9, 9-1 but she looked as though she was digging
herself out of trouble after she had saved two match points in
the third game.
</P>
<P>
However she turned her left ankle in the second game and by the
fifth it was beginning to slow her down.
</P>
<P>
Charman took advantage cleverly, mixing volley drops with
sudden fierce drives in chilly conditions which slowed the ball
and required players to chase further to reach it.
</P>
<P>
At the end Horner could only limp off the court and afterwards
needed to have the ankle treated and strapped before she could
walk properly.
</P>
<P>
Charman next plays the fourth-seeded British national champion
Sue Wright, who did complete a recovery from two games down in a
controversial match against her compatriot Rebecca Macree at 7-9,
3-9, 9-4, 9-6, 9-4.
</P>
<P>
Later the world number two from Australia Rodney Eyles came
through for a men's quarter-final with the world's most
dangerously improved player, the sixth-seeded Canadian Jonathan
Power.
</P>
<P>
Eyles had to work hard over four games to get past Mark
Chaloner and Power was devastating in winning 15-3, 15-2, 15-12
against Julien Bonetat.
</P>
<P>
Later Eyles compatriot, the former British Open finalist Brett
Martin, reached the quarter-finals with a four-game win over the
British national champion Mark Cairns who put up a remarkably good
performance only two weeks after having an operation for a
detached retina.
</P>
<P>
Martin meets the world number three from Scotland, Peter Nicol,
who really seems to have broken his British Open hoodoo after
four years of trying.
</P>
<P>
Nicol won 15-5, 10-15, 15-8, 15-12 against another Aussie
Anthony Hill.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Electrical appliances have
become a big source of profit for Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Total sales of electrical appliances for the home reached 1.95
billion yuan in Guangzhou in the first two months of this year, up
25.2 percent from the same 1996 period, according to the municipal
statistics bureau.

Consumers are showing greater enthusiasm for higher-quality
brand-name products, especially big-screen TVs.

63-inch sets, while sales of color TVs at the Friendship Group
reached 7.8 million yuan, 1.3 times the first two months of last
year. Popular brands include TCL, Changhong, and Konka.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the boom to improvements in Guangzhou's
living standard and greater exposure for domestic brand-name
products.

<P>
URUMQI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Funds from the United Nations and
the World Health Organization have helped improve the health of
women and children in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, the region has had various health
projects sponsored by the UN Children's Fund, the UN Population
Fund, and the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
Involving 1.26 million US dollars, the projects have benefited
some 3.6 million people in seven prefectures and sixteen counties.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at all levels spent 14.4 million yuan (about
1.7 million US dollars) during the six-year period to supplement
the foreign aid, six million yuan (about 700,000 US dollars) more
than the previously-promised amount.
</P>
<P>
A five-year project, jointly sponsored by the UN Children's
Fund and the Chinese government, was launched recently, which will
receive 700,000 US dollars from the Children's Fund and ten
million yuan (about 1.2 million US dollars) from local governments.
</P>
<P>
The project is intended to improve medical services at the
grass-roots level for women and children, increasing the number of
medical personnel, and improving their skills.
</P>
<P>
The projects will benefit 23 counties and cities in 11
prefectures, and provide services for 5.27 million people, or
nearly 32 percent of the region's total population.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Builds More Tropical Island Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 3 (Xinhua) --With the recent approval of Dongfang
to become a city, this tropical island province of Hainan in south
China now has nine cities under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Before China kicked off its reform and opening-up drive in
1979, Hainan, which was then a part of Guangdong Province, only
had Haikou as its city. When Hainan was approved to turn into a
provincial-level special economic zone in 1988, it set up two more
cities of Sanya and Tongshi.
</P>
<P>
The island province now has built nine cities, one economic
development zone of Yangpu and has ten counties.
</P>
<P>
The nine cities are rationally located, with Haikou in the
north and Sanya in the southern tip, and Qiongshan, Wenchang,
Qionghai, and Wanning cities in the east, Danzhou and Dongfang
cities, and the future city of heavy chemical industry --Yangpu
Economic Development Zone-- in the west, and Tongshi City built in
the central mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
Cities on the eastern coast have given their priorities for
economic development to light industry, tourism, and
high-efficiency tropical agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Danzhou and Dongfang cities, as well as Yangpu Economic
Development Zone on the western coast, where port conditions are
advantageous and mineral resources are rich, focus their efforts
on construction of an industrial corridor and the development of
heavy chemical industrial projects, as well as high-efficiency
farming.
</P>
<P>
Haikou has concentrated its efforts on building itself into an
influential center of politics, economy and culture for Hainan,
while Sanya, dubbed as "oriental Hawaii", has been busy with
developing tourism, light industry, tropical agriculture, and
related processing service. The two cities have built their
respective airports and port facilities.
</P>
<P>
Hainan's progress in urbanization has been made in tandem with
rapid economic growth. The gross domestic product (GDP) of Hainan
was 6.6 times of that for 1987, one year before the island became
a province.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, the province has made an actual use of 5.2
billion U.S. dollars of overseas funds and has witnessed big
increases in its investment for fixed assets of the whole
society.

</P>
<P>
Burns said the United States was concerned about the dire
situation of the refugees in eastern Zaire as they are in "a very
weakened state."
</P>
<P>
He called on Zaire's rebel leader Laurent Kabila to cooperate
with a U.N. plan to repatriate thousands of Rwandan refugees still
trapped in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very serious situation," he said. "There have been
good promises from Mr. Kabila and his forces, but they have not
come through with the action necessary to give the United Nations
access to the refugees, and some of those refugees have perished."
</P>
<P>
The repatriation plan requires Kabila's consent to allow relief
workers to get through the rebel-controlled city of Kisangani to
reach some 80,000 refugees situated some 16 to 25 miles south of
the city, Burns said. And to airlift the refugees needs Kabila's
permission.
</P>
<P>
"We call for urgent approval by him (Kabila), and consent of
this UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees)
repatriation plan and the assistance operations so that further
deaths and suffering can be prevented and rapid and safe
repatriation of the refugees can begin," Burns said.

<HEADLINE> Port at Sino-Russian Border Busy Handling Foreign Trade Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Manzhouli, a land port of entry on
the Sino-Russian border, handled over seven million tons of import
and export goods in 1996, 60 percent of the total handled by land
ports across China.
</P>
<P>
The value of the goods passing through Manzhouli reached 230
million US dollars, a rise of 48 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Manzhouli in the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region is where a
trunk railway linking Beijing with Moscow meets.
</P>
<P>
In order to cope with growing foreign trade, great efforts have
been made by the city to improve relevant conditions, city
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The past few years have seen the completion of a number of
infrastructure projects including a Sino-Russian border trade
zone, an international telecommunications building, renovation of
railway stations, new highways, an airport, and the
computerization of customs procedures.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the improved environment, the city was cited as
a national-level model port of entry in the 1995-96 period.
</P>
<P>
The city has also become a magnet for overseas investment,
having already drawing investors from Singapore, the Republic of
Korea, Taiwan, and Hongkong to launch 27 new projects with a total

<HEADLINE> University Presidents to Attend Beijing University Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Beijing University is planning on
inviting some 50 university presidents from various countries to
attend the ceremony marking the centenary of its founding next
year.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Harvard, Stanford, Oxford, and Tokyo
University have accepted invitations, sources revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
The university's anniversary falls on May 4, the day the
historic "May 4 Movement" was held in 1919 to introduce science
and democracy to the country. Beijing University was the
birthplace of the movement, one of the earliest attempts to
modernize China.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1898, "Beida" (for 'Beijing Da Xue', 'Beijing
University' in Chinese) was the first state-run university in
Chinese history. The founding of this Western-style school by the
late Qing Dynasty (1640-1911) signaled the beginning of a modern
higher education and modern science in China.
</P>
<P>
University presidents will hold a roundtable to discuss the
development of higher education in the 21st century, during the
celebration, sources say. Experts will also focus on Sinology,
which is becoming popular as the Chinese economy grows.
</P>
<P>
Several Nobel prize winners will take part in the event, which
will feature seminars on physics, mathematics, chemistry, and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Beida is the country's leading university in both the sciences
and liberal arts and has the country's most renowned scholars.
</P>
<P>
The university will hold a seminar on Marxism, for which the
campus was a major focal point in the 1920s. Many revolutionary
leaders, including Mao Zedong, had connections with the
university.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Flower Industry Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The flower industry in the Chinese
capital produced 18.6 million stems of flowers in 1996, 5.7 times
the figure of 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the Capital Urban Greening Committee, flower
planting acreage was about 2,000 hectares last year and had 38 million
plants, double the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
Some 96 million single stems of fresh flowers were sold in the
city last year, eight times the figure for 1991. Sales of fresh
flowers were worth 100 million yuan (about 12 million US dollars),
including 700,000 US dollars in exports.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 157 flower research discoveries
received city-level accreditation, and 380 new kinds of flowers
were introduced, bringing the total number of kinds of flowers in
the city to more than 600.
</P>
<P>
Flower research institutes have also made progress in using
wild flowers, with 84 new kinds of wild flowers cultivated last year.
</P>
<P>
There are 256 florists and three large flower markets, which
cover a total floor space of 27,000 sq. meters, in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, flower consumption in Beijing has
increased dramatically, and experts say that it will increase by
30 percent annually over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
To keep up with the general trend, the city will focus on
market construction and spend more money on flower research.
</P>
<P>
The city will also pursue favorable policies for the flower
industry to help its development.

NEW YORK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose sharply in
New York today after a Bank of Japan survey suggested interest
rates there will remain low.
</P>
<P>
The rebound erased most of the dollar's losses from the day
before, when rumors about unexpectedly strong results from the
so-called Tankan survey and fears over Rubin's upcoming Japan trip
helped push the dollar to a three-week low vs. the yen, a six-week
low vs. the mark and a 10-week low vs. the pound.
</P>
<P>
The dollar settled at 123.25 yen, up from 121.76 yen Tuesday.
The dollar cost 1.6765 marks, up from 1.6656. The pound cost
1.6431 U.S. dollars, down from 1.6528 U.S. dollars. The dollar
ended higher against most other currencies.

<HEADLINE> Low-Fat Diet Cuts Breast-Cancer Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Canadian researchers have the first
proof that women who shift to a low-fat diet can greatly reduce a
major risk factor for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
Women who trimmed the amount of calories they consume from fat
by about a third had a significant reduction in the amount of
dense tissue in their breasts over two years, according to the
study reported today in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Women whose breasts include more than 50 percent dense tissue
are up to five times as likely to develop cancer as those who have
little or no dense tissue.
</P>
<P>
In the study, half of the group of 818 women worked with
nutritionists to reduce the fat in their diets to an average of 21
percent. The difference was made up by adding carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
The others in the study were given nutrition counseling but did
not change their diets, which averaged 32 percent fat. Many
Canadians get more than 35 percent of their calories from fat.
</P>
<P>
Over two years, the low-fat group experienced an average
6-percent decrease in the amount of dense breast tissue. Those who
did not restrict fat had a decrease of 2 percent, a reduction that
occurs normally as women age.
</P>
<P>
Menopause magnifies the effect. Women in the low-fat group who
also underwent menopause had a 20-percent reduction in the area of
dense breast tissue, compared with 10 percent in the group that
made no major diet changes.
</P>
<P>
Levels of estrogen in the body did not change significantly as
the fat level declined, and the researchers saw no significant
differences between the mammograms of women taking
hormone-replacement therapy and those of women who were not taking
hormones.
</P>
<P>
The findings are the first result from what will be a 10-year
study of breast health that will follow about 4,500 Canadian women
in Ontario and British Columbia provinces whose breasts include
more than 50 percent high-density tissue.
</P>
<P>
Only genetic mutations pose a higher breast-cancer risk, and
they are present in fewer than 10 percent of the population. Other
breast-cancer factors include age, early onset of menstruation,
late menopause, not having children of having a late first
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
A woman's risk of developing breast cancer is about one in nine
over her lifetime. An estimated 18,400 new cases of breast cancer
will be diagnosed in Canada this year, and about 5,100 women will
die from it.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Praises Russia's Economic Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Michel Camdessus, managing
director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), today praised
Russia's economic stabilization achieved in the last few years and
also highlighted three major problems in the economy.
</P>
<P>
In a speech prepared for delivery at the Moscow Institute of
International Affairs on April 2, Camdessus noted, "Inflation has
been cut... and the exchange rate has stabilized."
</P>
<P>
"Central planning has been abolished and... two-thirds of the
economy is now in private hands," he said. "Trade barriers have
been reduced, and the ruble trades freely and can be readily
converted into foreign exchange."
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief also pointed to three key problems concerning the
state that have to be addressed: growth, the non-payment of taxes,
and corruption.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia's economic growth can be accelerated if the
government completes the institutional reforms on which a thriving
market economy depends. These include, he said, a simple and
transparent regulatory system, an effective legal and judicial
system that protects property rights, enforces contracts and helps
create an atmosphere of law, order and personal security as well
as a simple and broad-based tax system.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus stressed that the government should have the
"revenues to meet its obligations to workers, pensioners and all
who depend on government services.

<HEADLINE> British Bankers' Fears on European Monetary Union Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The City of London financiers see
the European Monetary Union (EMU) as the fastest growing danger to
the European banking industry, outweighing rogue traders,
derivatives and unwise lending into emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
In a survey of 170 British bankers, lawyers, accountants and
regulators carried out by the Study of Financial Innovation, the
EMU, due to be launched in 1999, emerged as a serious danger
because of the political and economic strains it may cause.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the survey revealed that poor management was
the most frequently cited danger, though few respondents were as
harsh as a City lawyer who said bank managements showed "lax
morals, no control, lack of understanding, little attention to
detail, inability to stimulate staff."
</P>
<P>
One of the greatest risks was the disruption that would be
caused if the introduction of the single European currency named
euro were to be delayed or canceled.
</P>
<P>
"The risk of bungled or premature EMU is rising," said Sir Adam
Ridley of Hambros Bank. Some other respondents also warned that
the EMU would increase the pressure for rationalization in the
French and Italian banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
Another primary concern for the bankers was excessive
competition, as surplus capital would drive banks to chase riskier
lending or trade in less liquid securities.

<HEADLINE> Major Refuses to Rule Out Britain's EMU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
has flatly refused to rule out his country's membership of the
European Monetary Union (EMU), saying that he would not "play
partisan politics."
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC radio interview today, Major, who is under
growing pressure to take a tougher line on the single currency,
said that the British government should take part in various
debates on the EMU as a single currency would affect Britain no
matter it would join it or not.
</P>
<P>
"And that is why as prime minister, with the interests of the
British nation as a whole at stake, I am not prepared to play
partisan politics. I must be there to represent the British
interest," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Let us suppose the other nations went ahead with the
European currency on a weak basis and produced a weak euro. What
would happen is that all the money that flows into Europe would
flow into the two strong currencies, let us say the Swiss franc
and sterling."
</P>
<P>
"That would put up exchange rate of sterling, damage our
exports and cost us jobs. That is a matter of very direct
relevance to us, whether we are in a single currency or whether we
are not in a single currency," he added.
</P>
<P>
The British government, which negotiated an "opt-out" right on
the single currency, has made it clear that "it is very unlikely
that a single currency can proceed safely on January 1, 1999, but
even if it did proceed with unreliable convergence, Britain would
not be part of it."

LAGOS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has recently completed the
repairs of the Tiga Dam in northern Kano State, the largest dam
in the country that almost collapsed last August due to serious
cracks.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria reported today that workers had
used 1,500 cubic meters of earth and 30 tipper loads of stones to
repair the dam on the Hadejia Jama'are River.
</P>
<P>
The report praised that the relevant authorities, by giving
the job to local engineers, have saved the country's foreign
exchange and reduced its over-dependence on foreign labor.
</P>
<P>
The dam was constructed in 1974.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, cracks on the embankment of the Bagauda Dam in Kano
State led to the collapse of the dam, causing huge losses of

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Discusses Mideast Situation With Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan
discussed the volatile situation in the Middle East with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in the State Department
today, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The discussions between the king and the secretary of state,
who also attended a White House meeting between the king and
President Bill Clinton Tuesday, were "designed to help the United
States play a constructive role in bringing the Israelis and
Palestinians together so that we might help them repair some of
the damage caused over the last couple of weeks by a variety of
events," Burns told reporters at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, after his meeting with King Hussein Tuesday, said he
was "personally prepared to do anything I can" to get peace talks
between the Israelis and Palestinians back on track.
</P>
<P>
He is looking forward to meeting Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu next week in an attempt to salvage the almost
broken down peace process. Netanyahu was reported to come to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased he's coming, and we're looking forward to
productive talks with him" when he meets with President Clinton
and Secretary Albright, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
He said Netanyahu's visit to Washington next Monday was
"important... particularly now that the peace negotiations are in
such dire straits."
</P>
<P>
"What we have in mind is using the influence of the United
States and the leadership of the president and the secretary of
state to... help the Israelis and Palestinians overcome their
differences," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, press secretary Mike McCurry brushed aside
questions about a possible Middle East summit, saying he was
unaware of plans for such a gathering "right now."
</P>
<P>
"We've explored a number of ideas on how we can get the parties
to re-engage," McCurry said at a briefing. "I'm not aware of any
plans for a summit."

<HEADLINE> French Gov't Optimistic About 1997 Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The French government today made an
optimistic prediction of the country's economic situation in 1997,
predicting a 2.3 percent growth and a public deficit controlled at
3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance and Economy Jean Arthuis said a 2.3 percent
growth is a "floor" and the government expects better economic
growth in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
The French national commission of account today also predicted
a 2.8 percent economic growth for the country in 1998. The
economic growth rate of France in 1996 was 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eight big economic institutions of France made a
somewhat less optimistic prediction of the economy, predicting a
2.2 percent growth in 1997 and 2.6 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The French government also predicts the creation of 120,000 to
140,000 jobs in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A total of 120,000 students graduate each year in France to
enter the country's job market.
</P>
<P>
The government said that France's exports will grow by 5.3
percent this year and will earn a surplus of 130 to 140 billion
francs (25 to 27 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The household purchase in France is expected to grow by 1.6
percent in 1997, lower than 2.1 percent in 1996, which was largely
attributed to the large quantity of automobiles bought by French
families taking advantage of a preferential policy by Prime
Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
On the public deficit, the government said that it will be
controlled at 3 percent of the GDP, the criteria set by the

<HEADLINE> US Must Be Able to Fight 2 Wars: Pentagon Draft Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Pentagon draft report
said that the U.S. forces must remain capable of fighting two
regional wars in close succession despite defense budget cuts, the
Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The final version of the draft document, or the Quadrennial
Defense Review, is due next month.
</P>
<P>
The document says that the American military forces will be in
high demand for peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, anti-drug
and other noncombat operations for the next 10-15 years, but must
remain ready to fight two regional wars.
</P>
<P>
The Post quoted the report, prepared by senior Pentagon
officials, as predicting a "period of strategic pause" between now
and at least 2010 during which no new superpower is likely to
emerge to challenge the U.S. as the Soviet Union did for four
decades.
</P>
<P>
"As part of the review, the military branches are being pressed
for fresh cuts in personnel levels to free up funds for high-tech
equipment purchases," the newspaper reported.
