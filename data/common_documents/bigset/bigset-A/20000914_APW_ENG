Explosion at Jakarta Stock Exchange
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A car bomb tore through a packed parking garage
beneath Jakarta's stock exchange on Wednesday, killing 15 people, injuring 27
and shaking confidence in Indonesia's attempts to reform after decades of
corrupt dictatorship. The blast damaged or destroyed 400 vehicles in the garage
filled with cars and drivers waiting for stockbrokers to finish work, said
national police chief Gen. Rusdihardjo.

Wen Ho Lee Could Still Sue
</SUBHEAD>

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee could still pursue a
civil lawsuit that claims the government invaded his privacy. Lee's attorney
says the plea agreement under which Lee was released Wednesday does not affect
the civil suit that's still on hold. Lee was set free Wednesday after pleading
guilty to one count under a deal in which prosecutors all but abandoned their
crumbling case against him, nine months after he was placed in solitary
confinement as a national security threat.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A confidant of Al Gore received an unsolicited package
Wednesday containing documents and a videotape that appeared to involve rival
George W. Bush's debate preparations, a Gore aide said. Tom Downey, a former
congressman who has been helping the vice president prepare for debates against
Bush, turned the material over to his lawyer. The attorney gave the package to
the FBI to determine whether the documents and tape were ''illegally obtained
from the Bush campaign,'' said Gore spokesman Mark Fabiani.

Cops Rule Out Ramsey in Sex Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Boulder police have ruled out a connection between a
1997 sexual assault on a 14-year-old girl and the 1996 slaying of JonBenet
Ramsey. Police began investigating a possible link in May after a newspaper
article suggested police may have overlooked a connection. The 14-year-old
victim in the September 1997 case attended the same dance academy as JonBenet,
and lived within two miles of the Ramseys' home. The victim in the 1997 attack
reported being sexually assaulted by an intruder who may have been lurking in
her home for hours. The girl's mother interrupted the attack and no suspect was
ever identified.

   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton repeatedly attacked Republican
Rep. Rick Lazio as too conservative for New York in the first debate of their
Senate campaign. Lazio responded by trying to link his Democratic rival to the
policies and even the peccadilloes of President Clinton, her husband. The often
testy exchanges included one where Lazio walked to her side and tried
unsuccessfully to get her to sign a pledge to bar soft money from their Senate
campaigns.

No Party, Protest in Dutch Gay Vote
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Neither party nor protest was held Wednesday
following the passing of groundbreaking gay rights legislation, as most in the
country seemed to shrug off the equal rights bill permitting homosexual
marriages and adoption as part of the Dutch view of modern life. The bill was
backed in a 109-33 vote in the 150-seat of the lower house Tuesday and gay
rights activists said it will create unprecedented equality for gay couples.
Staunch resistance came only from a small minority of religious political
parties. It is set to become law next year, pending a vote in the upper house of
parliament, largely seen as a formality.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Florence Lingers Off N.C.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Hurricane Florence weakened into a tropical storm
Wednesday, a day after being blamed for at least two deaths in
North Carolina, and forecasters said it could soon post a threat to
Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Florence, which had sustained winds of 70 mph, could regenerate
into a hurricane as it slowly moves away from the United States,
forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Florence will have an opportunity to re-strengthen to
hurricane status once it begins to move away from its present
location toward warmer waters,'' said Lixion Avila, a hurricane
specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Avila said Bermuda should monitor Florence's progress and a
hurricane watch may be required early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. Wednesday, Florence, the sixth named storm of the
2000 Atlantic hurricane season, was about 525 miles west-southwest
of Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Strong rip currents associated with the hurricane caught
swimmers by surprise Tuesday at Kure Beach, N.C., and a man and a
woman died. Seven other people had to be rescued. Another man was
missing after falling out of a kayak at Carolina Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The two beaches remained closed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters were also watching a system in the Caribbean that
could become a tropical depression within the next 24 hours, Blake
said. It is located southeast of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and is
moving to the northwest between 10 mph and 15 mph.

<HEADLINE> Estefan, Miguel, Win Latin Awards  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Not content with his record eight Grammys in
February, legendary guitarist Carlos Santana won three trophies
Wednesday in the inaugural Latin Grammy Awards, including the top
prize -- record of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran rocker's duet with Mexican rockers Mana, ''Corazon
Espinado,'' won record of the year seven months after another
Santana song, ''Smooth,'' won the same honor at the other Grammy
Awards. He also won an award for rock performance by a duo or group
with vocal and for best pop instrumental performance.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican crooner Luis Miguel also won three awards, including
album of the year for ''Amarte Es Un Placer.'' Mana won one award
in addition to its two with Santana.
</P>
<P>
   Santana, who alternately dedicated his awards to Africa, to the
women of the world, bilingual education and Nelson Mandela, said
winning so often doesn't make him jaded.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels like the first kiss, when a beautiful woman allows
you to touch her tongue with your tongue,'' he said. ''It feels
very natural and divine and human.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards were started by an offshoot of the National Academy
of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences, which produces the Grammys, to
capitalize on a growing interest in Latin music.
</P>
<P>
   With a broad definition of Latin music -- anything sung in either
Spanish or Portuguese -- the first nominations caused some
controversy. The largest Latin record label in the United States,
Fonovisa, boycotted, complaining that the Latin Grammys slighted
Mexican styles such as norteno, tejano and ranchera. Three of its
artists won awards and were not there to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   There also was some grumbling that television producers were
favoring artists who sing in English and are better known among
Americans. American teen favorites Christina Aguilera, 'N Sync and
Ricky Martin performed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope these awards will unite people,'' producer-songwriter
Emilio Estefan said. ''Latinos were discriminated against for many
years. I feel now we're making progress in bringing recognition to
our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Estefan, Argentine rocker Fito Paez, Colombian singer Shakira
and Dominican singer Juan Luis Guerra won two trophies apiece.
</P>
<P>
   A hip-swiveling Martin, paying tribute to the late mambo king
Tito Puente, opened the Latin Grammy telecast. Puente, who died in
June, won an award for best tropical performance. A tearful Audrey
Puente, a television news personality in New York City, accepted
the trophy for her father. She said he was particularly proud of
his album, ''Mambo Birdland,'' and hoped it would win an award.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only was he a great musician and humanitarian, but he was
a great leader for the Latin community,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin Grammys named a Cuban singer in his 70s, Ibrahim
Ferrer, as its best new artist. He came to prominence recently
through his work on the ''Buena Vista Social Club'' album.
</P>
<P>
   Estefan, Gloria's husband, was honored as producer of the year
for his work on eight separate albums. He also directed the winner
of best music video, Gloria Estefan's performance of ''No Me Dejes
De Querer.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerra won awards for best merengue performance and his song,
''El Niagara En Bicicleta,'' was named best tropical song. Paez was
the songwriter for ''Al Lado Del Camino,'' which won the Latin
Grammy for best rock song. The same song won best male rock vocal
performance.
</P>
<P>
   In a category that pitted two fathers and sons against each
other, heartthrob Alejandro Fernandez won best ranchero
performance, beating his father, Vicente. Antonio Aguilar and his
son, Pepe, were also nominees in the category.
</P>
<P>
   Shakira, honored for best female vocal and best female rock
performance, saluted her native country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to dedicate this award to that country that is going
through difficult times right now but never forgets how to smile,''
she said. ''This is for you, Colombia. Para ti Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   A blue-haired Celia Cruz won a Latin Grammy for best salsa
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour ceremony was televised on CBS in the United States
and was seen in more than 120 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,600 members of the Latin Academy of Recording Arts &AMP;
Sciences were eligible to vote in the 40 award categories.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Delays Rebel Actions  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The government is considering
imposing a news blackout on the prolonged hostage crisis involving
Muslim rebels in the southern Philippines, an official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre's comments follow
suggestions from other Philippine officials that the government is
considering a military attack on the Abu Sayyaf rebels. The rebels,
who have been holding hostages for months, recently released many
of them in exchange for millions of dollars but then angered the
government by kidnapping three more people from a Malaysian diving
resort Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will endorse the idea of a non-reporting of the operational
matters or matters that will prejudice national interest,'' Aguirre
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government should announce general actions involving
the hostage crisis but details should be kept secret to protect
government operations.
</P>
<P>
   The latest kidnapping, following a promise by the guerrillas not
to take any more hostages while negotiations are under way, was
seen as a defiance of the government. However, during a high-level
Cabinet meeting Wednesday chaired by President Joseph Estrada, the
government opted to hold off for now on tougher steps -- including a
military attack.
</P>
<P>
   The abduction in Malaysia followed the release Saturday of four
Europeans, the last foreigners from a group of 21 hostages taken in
April from another Malaysian resort. The rebels have been holding
their captives on Jolo, an island in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The government said Thursday it is giving responsibility for
negotiations for the three Malaysians to local officials on Jolo
instead of to a special negotiating team that handled the earlier
abductions. The team has been criticized for paying huge ransoms to
the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf are also holding one Filipino captured in April,
two French television journalists, an American Muslim and 12
Filipino Christian evangelists. The rebels claim they are fighting
for an independent Islamic state in the impoverished southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations for the remaining hostages have been suspended
because of fighting among Abu Sayyaf factions over the division of
ransom money. Negotiators say about $15 million in ransom has been
paid so far, about $10 million of it by Libya.
</P>
<P>
   The abduction of the three new hostages has sparked fears of
another wave of kidnappings encouraged by the large ransom
payments.

<HEADLINE> Blair Rejects Tax Concessions  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Britons awoke Thursday to eerily empty roads,
depleted supermarket shelves -- and troops on standby, a sign of
Prime Minister Tony Blair's hardened resolve not to give in to
protesters angry over high fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said ''lives are at risk'' from the protesters, whose
weeklong demonstrations outside fuel depots and refineries have
left gasoline pumps bone-dry and disrupted schools, hospitals,
businesses and transportation across Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign the crisis may be winding down, a key group of
protesters announced Thursday morning it was ending its refinery
picket.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have backed down. We have won the moral issue,'' said
Brynle Williams, spokesman for protesters at the Stanlow refinery
in northwest England. He called on other demonstrators across the
country to end their pickets and join in a national campaign for a
cut in fuel tax.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came hours after Blair went on television for a
second night to appeal for an end to the protests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Real damage is now being done to real people,'' Blair said
Wednesday evening. He blamed protesters for fuel shortages that
have triggered school closings, delayed non-vital surgery in
hospitals and even threatened deliveries by Britain's famously
reliable Royal Mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not just schools, but teachers, police, firemen -- the
employees on whom our public services depend,'' Blair said. ''Lives
are at risk if those people can't get to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's no-surrender stance was echoed by leaders in Belgium and
Germany, where fuel protesters have also snarled traffic and
targeted political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In London, scores of trucks were stopped by police Wednesday on
Park Lane, home to some of the city's most expensive hotels, as
drivers tried to converge on Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's gas prices average $4.31 a gallon, with taxes
accounting for three-quarters of the cost, and polls show that a
majority of the public supports the protesters. But signs of
fatigue are setting in as the country contemplates a weekend
without crucial goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   ''Enough is enough,'' advised a front-page editorial in
Thursday's edition of the mass-market Mirror newspaper. ''No fuel
protest, however justified, is worth the loss of a single life,''
it said. The tabloid Mail called on protesters to ''end your
blockade today, while you still hold the moral high ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, granted emergency powers to deal with the
crisis, deployed about 80 military fuel tankers to strategic points
across the country Wednesday night, the Ministry of Defense said.
</P>
<P>
   Health Secretary Alan Milburn said he had ordered National
Health Service administrators to have emergency plans in place.
Late Wednesday, the National Blood Authority also went on alert,
saying it feared its blood supplies could soon be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Peter Davis, CEO of the Sainsbury's supermarket chain, said
his stores would be out of food in ''days rather than weeks'' as
buyers rushed to stock up on milk, bread and other essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Some fuel did trickle back to service stations Wednesday. About
500 tankers left refineries and depots, many under police escort.
Some truck drivers refused to cross protest lines, citing fears for
their safety.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day there would be at least 3,000 tanker deliveries
in Britain, the Petrol Retailers Association said.
</P>
<P>
   Most gas stations remained closed, with Esso saying the ''vast
majority'' of its 1,620 stations were shut and Shell reporting that
only 30 of its 1,100 garages had gas.
</P>
<P>
   Although Britain has been hardest hit, other European countries,
including France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, have
experienced traffic-snarling protests in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, where fuel taxes are slated to rise at the start of
the year, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was targeted by angry
protesters when he visited the northern city of Schwerin.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder warned that the protests would only hurt Germany's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drop this dangerous game, because it could threaten the growth
an employment prospects we currently have,'' he said. But the
national truckers association called for new protests later this
month to slow traffic on the autobahn.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt also refused demands
Wednesday for a fuel-tax rebate for the trucking industry, even as
protests expanded to major freeways and border points.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Blair insisted he would not be pressured into
lowering fuel taxes, saying that would shatter his government's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever the protesters do ... it cannot be right to try to
force a change in policy by these means,'' he said. ''We will not
be intimidated. We will not give into violence, to blockades, to
threats.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, too, said they would not back down.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we leave now then everything we have done will be for
nothing,'' said Mark Williams, a spokesman for the protesters.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Women Alter Their Fashion  </HEADLINE>
By JASPER MORTIMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Two young women stroll arm-in-arm along
the Bosporus waterway that separates Asia from Europe. Head scarves
signal their Muslim faith, but short-sleeved blouses and
leg-revealing dress slits show a greater allegiance to Western
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, a woman walks briskly to work in a tapered blouse,
elegant pants, sunglasses and chrome bracelet. She looks European --
except for her dark blue head scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Islamic world, fashion aficionados are finding ways
to meld religious morality with a modern style that expresses their
individuality.
</P>
<P>
   From westernized Bosnia to conservative Iran, the head scarf is
the emblem of faith, but the rest of a woman's outfit can vary
widely.
</P>
<P>
   The clash between haute couture and religion is deepest in
overwhelmingly Muslim but staunchly secular Turkey, which aspires
to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish women who seek to be fashionable and religious don head
scarves, but also watch Paris fashion shows on television and leaf
through fashion magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to be as chic as French women while preserving their
religious values,'' said Mustafa Karaduman, founding director of
the most successful Islamic fashion house in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Islam's holy book, the Quran, doesn't specify what a woman
should wear, but says clothing should ''cover all her body except
the face and palms,'' according to Souad Ibrahim Saleh, Egypt's
only female cleric and a professor at Cairo's Al-Azhar religious
university, the most respected institution for Islam's majority
Sunni sect.
</P>
<P>
   However, degrees of adherence differ sharply.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, a dress code was enacted after the 1979 Islamic
revolution requiring women to wear head scarves and long coats even
at the height of summer. But fashion crept in, taking off after the
moderate Mohammad Khatami became president in 1997. Many women now
buy coats that follow the body's curves.
</P>
<P>
   Typical is Shahla, 23, of Teheran, who is proud of her Japanese
style coat, called Model Kimono. ''We have to wear a coat, so we
have to be fashionable with the style,'' Shahla said, declining to
give her last name.
</P>
<P>
   Flashier Turkey, for its part, helped spawn the Islamic chic
market, which was spotted by Karaduman more than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   His Istanbul-based company, Tekbir, grew from a workshop with
two sewing machines making 100 garments a week to a business that
produces 10,500 garments a week and owns 10 stores in Turkey and
one in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Tekbir and its sister brand D-8 are the leading names in
Islamic fashion, with sales in outlets throughout Turkey and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic fashion appeals mostly to traditional village women who
flooded into the largely Westernized cities of Turkey in recent
years. They felt that city residents looked down on them as
unsophisticated newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   With Islamic chic, ''you both retain your morality and build a
modern image for yourself,'' said Ayse Saktamber, professor of
sociology at Middle East Technical University in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic chic makes it easier for women from traditional homes to
work in the modern sector. The fashionable cut to their clothes
lets them feel comfortable in a secular office, while head scarves,
long sleeves and skirts let them retain their families' respect.
</P>
<P>
   The launch of Tekbir shops in 1984 coincided with a Turkish
government that encouraged traditional women to enter the work
force.
</P>
<P>
   Such women got a further boost during the 1996-97 Islamic
government of Necmettin Erbakan, who relaxed a law that banned
female civil servants from wearing headscarves at work.
</P>
<P>
   Tekbir's sales increased by about 35 percent during the reign of
Erbakan, who himself was fond of Versace ties, Karaduman said. The
former premier was forced from power by the military in 1997 and
civil servants are now again banned from wearing head scarves at
work.
</P>
<P>
   Karaduman is quick to exploit political events. He named one of
his suits after Merve Kavakci, a Turkish legislator forced from
parliament last year after she tried to take the oath of office
wearing a headscarf. Another Tekbir suit is named Virtue after
Kavakci's Islamic Virtue Party.
</P>
<P>
   Karaduman also exploits what is chic, even at the expense of
what is Islamic.
</P>
<P>
   In Tekbir fashion shows, models wearing head scarves and suits
tapered at the waist saunter down a cat walk, swaying their hips
and thrusting them forward. Unlike women in more conservative
Muslim countries, they wear makeup, look male spectators in the eye
and greet applause with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Karaduman admits he would not allow his wife or daughter to wear
makeup, but he says it is necessary in fashion shows and publicity
brochures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am personally against this trend, but the model pictures
would not work without makeup,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hanks, Newman Support Actor Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Hanks, Paul Newman and other stars turned
out to support striking commercial actors at rallies on both coasts
as federal mediators attempted to restart talks in the 5-month-old
walkout.
</P>
<P>
   ''Actors are the best bargain in the advertising business. We
bring life to words on a printed page,'' Hanks told a crowd of
about 1,000 people in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks, appearing with Alfre Woodard, David Hyde Pierce and
others, called on the advertising industry to negotiate a fair
contract with the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation
of Television and Radio Artists.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for the unions and advertisers met Wednesday
with federal mediators in New York in an effort to resume
negotiations, which broke down in July.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a rally on Sixth Avenue drew a host of stars,
including Newman, Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, Kevin Bacon,
Olympia Dukakis and Billy Crudup.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Treat Williams led the crowd in a chant of ''Show the
commercial; show me the money!'' after telling his fellow actors
that he survived being out of work for two years by doing TV
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The unions, which represent 135,000 actors, have been on strike
since May 1 over disputes on residual fees, money paid to
commercial performers each time an advertisement airs.

<HEADLINE> Carters in Fla. To Build Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A neighborhood here was bustling with
some high-quality construction workers: a football star, a
politician and one former president.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, and a crew of volunteers
were in town Wednesday helping build homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just so great,'' Johnnie Mae Williams, 38, said. ''I
never dreamed I would have a president help build my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sweating workers on the small cul-de-sac were former
football star and congressman Jack Kemp, Habitat for Humanity
founder Millard Fuller, Jacksonville Mayor John Delaney and
Jacksonville Jaguars owners Wayne and Delores Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   The dignitaries joined some 2,000 volunteers in a foggy dawn
that turned into a hot sunny day, building 100 homes for low-income
families sponsored by HabiJax, the Jacksonville branch of Habitat
for Humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The new homes in the Fairway Oaks subdivision will help move
Habitat toward the completion of its 100,000th low-income home this
week in New York City's Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest blessing will be ours because we at Habitat have
had a chance to fulfill our destiny before God in a very special
way,'' Carter told the volunteers.

   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A car bomb tore through a packed parking garage
beneath Jakarta's stock exchange on Wednesday, killing 15 people, injuring 27
and shaking confidence in Indonesia's attempts to reform after decades of
corrupt dictatorship. The blast damaged or destroyed 400 vehicles in the garage
filled with cars and drivers waiting for stockbrokers to finish work, said
national police chief Gen. Rusdihardjo.

says the plea agreement under which Lee was released Wednesday does not affect
the civil suit that's still on hold. Lee was set free Wednesday after pleading
guilty to one count under a deal in which prosecutors all but abandoned their
crumbling case against him, nine months after he was placed in solitary

   MIAMI (AP) -- Hurricane Florence weakened into a tropical storm Wednesday, a
day after being blamed for at least two deaths in North Carolina, and
forecasters said it could soon post a threat to Bermuda. Florence, which had
sustained winds of 70 mph, could regenerate into a hurricane as it slowly moves
away from the United States, forecasters said. Strong rip currents associated
with the hurricane caught swimmers by surprise Tuesday at Kure Beach, N.C., and
a man and a woman died. Seven other people had to be rescued. Another man was

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 3, Dodgers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Rob Ryan singled home the winning
run with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning Wednesday night
and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona won for the fourth time in six games and stayed 4&AMP;frac12; games
behind New York in the NL wild card race. The Mets beat Milwaukee
4-1 in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that began as a duel between Kevin Brown and Brian
Anderson, the Dodgers made it 2-all in the ninth on Adrian Beltre's
RBI single with two outs off Matt Mantei.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Conti led off the Arizona ninth with a bunt single off
Terry Adams (6-8) and took second when Matt Williams followed with
a single. Danny Bautista then grounded into a double play, with
Conti taking third.
</P>
<P>
   After Craig Counsell walked, Ryan batted for Dan Plesac (5-0).
Ryan, a rookie who had one RBI this season, singled sharply up the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson scattered four hits over eight innings for Arizona. The
Diamondbacks gave him the lead when Jay Bell and Greg Colbrunn each
hit solo homers in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre hit his 18th homer for Los Angeles, which lost for the
seventh time in nine games. The Dodgers dropped 8&AMP;frac12; games behind the
Mets for the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre's tying single came in the ninth after Shawn Green walked
and stole second. After the hit, Plesac relieved Mantei.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin lined Anderson's first pitch into right field for a
single, but the left-hander then retired 18 of the next 19 Dodgers
batters.
</P>
<P>
   Green led off the seventh with the Dodgers' second hit, a sharp
single to center, but was erased on Gary Sheffield's double-play
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was nearly as sharp until running into trouble in the
sixth. Bell led off with his 15th home run and one out later,
Colbrunn hit his 13th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre pulled the Dodgers within 2-1 when he homered leading off
the eighth. Todd Hundley followed with a 100-foot double to right
as the ball rolled past Bell and no one covered second base, but
was stranded.
Notes: An MRI performed on Arizona CF Steve Finley's injured left
hand confirmed what the X-rays taken after Tuesday's game had
shown: no broken bones. Finley was hit on the left hand below the
pinky by Onan Masaoka in the eighth inning of the Diamondbacks' 5-4
victory and had to leave the game. He's listed as day-to-day with a
deep bone bruise and will be out until at least Sunday. Bautista
started in Finley's place and doubled and singled. ... Goodwin's
single extended his hitting streak to 14 games, a team high for the
season.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 11, Padres 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Todd Hollandsworth hit a grand slam and a solo
home run as the Colorado Rockies beat the San Diego Padres 11-0 on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandworth's first career grand slam capped a five-run first
inning. He added his 15th homer in the seventh inning to give him a
career-high five RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bohanan (10-9) pitched a nine-hit shutout for his second
complete game of the season. The left-hander allowed only three
runners to reach third base, in pitching his second career shutout.
He struck out three and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton went 0-for-4, before being lifted for a pinch-hitter
in the seventh inning, to drop his major league-leading average to
.378.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Eaton (5-3) made his first start since Sept. 3 after
skipping his last turn due to exhaustion. The rookie gave up eight
runs on 11 hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies opened the first inning with consecutive singles by
Juan Pierre and Nefi Perez. After Eaton retired the next two
batters, Jeffrey Hammonds' infield single loaded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   A passed ball by Wiki Gonzalez allowed Pierre to score, and a
walk to Todd Walker reloaded the bases. Hollandsworth followed with
a drive that just cleared the right-field fence for a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cirillo and Hammonds reached on singles in the second
before Walker's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Mayne, who had three hits, added an RBI single in the
fifth and Cirillo's infield single drove in a run in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hollandsworth has three multihomer games in his career. The
last came when he was playing for Los Angeles on May 11, 1996
against St. Louis. ... Bohanon won his fourth straight road start.
Against the Padres, Bohanon is only 3-7 in 11 career starts. ... In
Eaton's last three starts, he's lasted just 12 innings, allowing 19
earned runs on 24 hits. ... San Diego committed three errors and
has five in the last two games. ... Colorado has scored more runs
(123) in the first inning than any other inning.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Professor Emerges From Jail  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA BRYSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Saad Eddin Ibrahim, sociology professor and
an apparent threat to the Egyptian regime, is also a man with a
sense of humor. On Wednesday, he titled a back-to-school lecture
about his recent detention without trial: ''How I spent my summer
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim said the main lesson he had learned from his 45 days in
jail -- one he wanted to share with students and fellow teachers at
the American University in Cairo -- was that the fight for greater
democracy in Egypt must continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state, the people in the totalitarian wing of the state,
are not going to allow any margin of freedom for civil society
beyond what they decide themselves'' is appropriate, Ibrahim said.
''Egypt deserves better.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for volunteers to help him monitor next month's
parliamentary elections, though he said his discovery of widespread
fraud when he monitored the last elections in 1995 prompted his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's ruling National Democratic Party has almost completely
dominated politics here for more than two decades and has long
denied accusations that it uses fraud and intimidation to stay in
power. The NDP won control of 97 percent of parliament's 454 seats
in the 1995 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim, 61, was arrested in late June. He was released Aug. 10
after being questioned, he said, about whether he had spied for the
United States, accepted foreign money without government permission
and forged ballots for a voter education video that allegedly would
have tarnished Egypt's image. No charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian prosecutors have denied Ibrahim was arrested for
political reasons, but they have never made public why he was held
or whether they now consider his case closed.
</P>
<P>
   His detention was one of several developments that have stifled
independent voices just as elections are approaching:
</P>
<P>
   --In May, the government suspended the tiny but outspoken
opposition Labor Party, citing a power struggle within the party.
</P>
<P>
   --The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights moved its operations
into staffers' homes last month for lack of funds, saying the
government had refused to grant it permission to receive money from
abroad or raise funds in Egypt. Smaller civil and human rights
groups who say they face similar pressure have suspended work
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   --Scores of Muslim Brotherhood members have been arrested in
recent months because of their activities in the banned group,
which is Egypt's largest Muslim organization and a sharp government
critic.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim's lecture, open to the entire campus at the start of the
school year, was a chance for the American University in Cairo to
make its support for him clear. The liberal, American-style
university has at times had to tread carefully in the face of
criticism from the Egyptian government and conservative elements in
Egyptian society.
</P>
<P>
   University President John Gerhart was in the crowd of more than
200 that packed a small lecture hall. The dean of Ibrahim's
department compared him to Gandhi in his introduction. One Egyptian
student rose to tell Ibrahim he had inspired her to switch from
business to political science so she could learn more about her
country.
</P>
<P>
   Another student, Samar Yehia, said afterward she had come to
reassure herself her old professor had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to make sure he wouldn't give up,'' said Yehia, a
20-year-old economics and political science major. ''He plans on
monitoring the elections, he's going to continue to write articles.
This seminar is enough evidence he's not going to change his
strategy.''

<HEADLINE> Physicists Fear U.S. Takeover of Work  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- An international group of physicists who think
they may be tantalizingly close to discovering a long-sought
subatomic particle face a tough decision: Do they press on with
their research or leave the hunt -- and probably a Nobel price -- to
their main American rival?
</P>
<P>
   The board of CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics,
was deciding Thursday whether to halt experiments using the world's
largest nuclear accelerator so they can switch to a new one, a
changeover process that will take about five years.
</P>
<P>
   If CERN scientists do that, they'll have to sit and watch as the
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., has free
rein to discover the so-called Higgs boson, theorized to be
responsible for all mass in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be one of the greatest landmark achievements of
physics,'' said Chris Tully, a Princeton University professor who
has been working on the search for the Higgs boson at CERN.
</P>
<P>
   But CERN has long planned to start construction Oct. 2 to
replace the Large Electron-Positron collider with a more powerful
model, much desired by the scientific community -- including Fermi
and the U.S. government, both contributors to the project.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision came down to two choices: The board will
either keep the LEP running for another month or two, or even
longer, or stick to its contracts to start the changeover to the
Large Hadron Collider.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma may sound arcane, but the scientists involved say
the discovery they're after would be a huge one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mass is a very important property of matter, and we have
nothing in our current theory that says even a word about it,''
said Claude Detraz, one of two research directors at CERN. ''I'm
sure history will consider it a major step in the understanding of
matter,'' even if ''it sounds like a little specialized
craziness.''
</P>
<P>
   Tully said the mass of subatomic particles can make objects hard
to break or fragile, determine whether they are a conducting metal
or an insulating one, even create their color.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us it's one of the most fundamental questions we can ask,
and that's why we've spent our lives looking for this,'' Tully
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at CERN have recorded three subatomic collisions
where they think they have seen ''shadows'' of the Higgs boson
particle. Being able to claim the ''discovery'' of the Higgs will
be a feather in the cap of the successful laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The sighting of the shadows came at a frustrating time for the
CERN scientists -- just as they were pushing the LEP to its outside
limits in its final months.
</P>
<P>
   Tully conceded that CERN is far from having enough occurrences
to be able to claim ''discovery'' even if it makes more in coming
months. But, he said, in the give-and-take world of physics, that
would give Fermilab even more help in its own search, helping it to
pinpoint where to look.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Jackson, spokeswoman for Fermilab, said it was ''a little
premature'' to speculate that the lab outside Chicago would
benefit. However, she said, Fermilab scientists were ''watching
with interest'' to see what CERN decides.
</P>
<P>
   Fermilab also has a stake in seeing the Large Hadron Collider
start up on time.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is giving about a half-billion dollars toward the
European project. About one-third of the 7,000 scientists who will
work on the LHC will be from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, CERN planned to put the LHC on top of the
11-year-old LEP inside its circular, 17-mile tunnel under the
Swiss-French border. But the engineering problems were too
difficult and the decision was made to remove the LEP and install
the $1.8 billion LHC in its place.
</P>
<P>
   CERN would encounter massive extra costs in delaying
construction of the LHC -- and risk angering physicists who will
have to defer experiments they have long dreamed of starting in
2005.
</P>
<P>
   The long-sought Higgs boson was named for British physicist
Peter Higgs, who postulated its existence more than 30 years ago at
the University of Edinburgh to explain how atoms, and thus
everything else in the universe, have weight. CERN has designed the
LHC precisely to discover the particle, but Detraz said the
scientists there will have plenty to do even if Fermilab wins the
discovery race.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Christopher Columbus saw the coast, it was discovering
America, but it was not studying America,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> National Guard, Army To Align  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army's eight National Guard combat
divisions will for the first time be aligned with active-duty Army
corps, giving clearer focus to their training and further eroding
the notion that Guard members are mere ''weekend warriors'' with
little chance of shipping out for war, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The change reflects Army leaders' search for ways to make better
use of the National Guard at a time when the active-duty force is
stretched thin by a variety of peacetime missions at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, was announcing the
plan Thursday at a National Guard convention in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Aligning a Guard division with an Army corps, such as the 1st
Corps, based at Fort Lewis, Wash., is designed to allow the
guardsmen to focus their training on specific potential combat
situations. The 1st Corps, for example, is focused on reinforcing
the permanent U.S. contingent in South Korea if war with the North
breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrangement means members of National Guard combat
divisions are more likely to be called on not only for major wars
but also as rotation units for peacekeeping operations in places
like Bosnia and Kosovo, according to Army officials who discussed
the matter on condition they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The change does not make National Guard divisions a part of the
Pentagon's official war plans, which are written by the commanders
in chief, or CINCs, of combat commands like U.S. Central Command,
whose area of responsibility includes the Persian Gulf. A CINC
could call on a Guard division, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Army National Guard has 360,000 members in 3,200 units in
2,700 communities across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The active-duty Army has 470,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki will announce that the 35th Infantry Division of the
Kansas National Guard, for example, is being aligned with the
Army's 5th Corps, whose operational focus is Europe. The 35th will
be ''teamed'' with Fort Riley, Kan., home of active-duty brigades
of the 1st Infantry Division and the 1st Armored Division.
</P>
<P>
   Also part of the 5th Corps team will be two separate National
Guard brigades, the 256th Infantry Brigade of the Louisiana
National Guard and the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment of the
Tennessee National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Details on which other National Guard divisions would be linked
to which Army corps were not available Wednesday. The two other
Army corps besides 1st Corps and 5th Corps are 18th Airborne Corps,
based at Fort Bragg, N.C., and 3rd Corps, based at Fort Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the National Guard have been pressing for the Army to
more fully integrate the active and reserve parts of the service.
Lt. Gen. Russell C. Davis, chief of the National Guard Bureau,
raised the issue during a speech Wednesday to the National Guard
Association of the United States in Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can only improve our readiness and our training,'' Davis
said in remarks prepared for delivery. ''We will provide an
expanded capability to the Army that will far exceed its modest
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   There has long been tension between the active-duty Army and its
reserve component over sharing resources and decision-making
authority. Recently, for example, the National Guard complained
that its UH-1 Huey helicopters are rapidly approaching obsolescence
and that modernization dollars have gone mostly to the active-duty
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard contributes to U.S. active-duty Army missions
in many ways. Just this year troops from the 49th Armored Division
of the Texas Guard assumed command of the American peacekeeping
contingent in Bosnia, becoming the first guard division to head an
overseas mission since the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   In October 2001 the 29th Infantry Division of the Virginia and
Maryland National Guard is scheduled to take command in Bosnia, and
the Army is expected to announce other National Guard rotations for
Bosnia soon.

<HEADLINE> Romania Homosexuals Coming Out  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Florin Buhuceanu was studying to
become a theologian, until he decided to stop hiding the fact that
he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after quitting theology school, Buhuceanu, 30, does
not regret publicly announcing his sexual preference -- a very rare
decision in Romania. He now runs the country's only organization to
promote gay rights, even though he lost friends and receives
abusive telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   While his thinking brings him closer to the Europe of which
Romania desires to be a part, it puts him at odds with the
influential Romanian Orthodox Church, whose top clergy this week
are fighting to convince lawmakers that homosexual behavior must be
kept illegal here.

said as the Holy Synod began this week, referring to the biblical
city of sexual vice. He wants a national referendum on whether
homosexuality should be legal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The church rejects tainted love in order to protect and
promote the holy love that God desires,'' Patriarch Teoctist wrote
in a letter to parliament. ''Europe will receive us at their bosom
the way we are,'' he wrote, urging lawmakers to keep legislation
that makes public displays of homosexual behavior illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in June, the Chamber of Deputies scrapped communist-era
legislation that discriminates against gays and criminalizes
homosexual behavior that causes ''a public outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote on the legislation soon, just two
months ahead of general elections. Gay activists fear that with
elections around the corner, lawmakers may be reluctant to oppose
the Orthodox Church, to which almost 90 percent of Romanians
belong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Orthodox Church is hypocritical and immoral,'' said
59-year-old writer Dominic Brezianu, who now lives in Richmond,
Calif. ''Some of the highest level prelates were notorious for
their immoral collaboration (with the communists) and they meet as
a synod.... to condemn in their obscure ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   Brezianu fled communist Romania in 1980 because he was harassed
by authorities for being a homosexual. Those attitudes linger in
Romania, a conservative Balkan society.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the Foundation for an Open Society revealed
that 77 percent of Romanians would not want to be the neighbor of a
homosexual. But there are also signs that the stranglehold of fear
and prejudice is easing.
</P>
<P>
   Romanian newspapers are beginning to write about homosexuals
without the intolerance that characterized the early 1990s. Local
disco Casablanca is welcoming gays, offering security to the
clientele, and Brezianu launched a volume of Homo-erotic poems
called ''Stopovers'' on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The International Gay and Lesbian Association is planning its
annual conference in October in Bucharest, which could anger the
church and anti-homosexual groups.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to parliament, Buhuceanu appealed to legislators to
put human rights above religious convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that different religious institutions are putting on
pressure to maintain anti-homosexual legislation, but Romania is a
secular state and your responsibility is to pass laws that respect
human rights,'' he wrote.

<HEADLINE> EU Mulls Mideast Failure Backlash  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- France, the current head of the European
Union, is calling on Israel and the Palestinians to show maximum
''political courage'' to reach a settlement in the next few weeks,
warning that failure will inevitably trigger a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   The French comments came Wednesday, shortly before a Palestinian
Cabinet minister announced that Israel-Palestinian talks would
resume Thursday in New York. The sides are coming at the invitation
of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for a round of
negotiations that Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami called
''incredibly difficult but also promising.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat held separate talks with President Clinton and Albright at
last week's U.N. Millennium Summit. But talks stalled again over
the critical issue of East Jerusalem, which both sides claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''We simply must leave no stone unturned to take advantage of
the short time we have ahead of us,'' French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine told a news conference. ''To pull this off, we will
have to be extremely inventive when it comes to Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, who have been trying to broker an agreement,
have said only a few weeks remain to secure a peace treaty -- first
because the U.S. Congress, which would have to fund a treaty,
adjourns in early October, and second because Israel's parliament
reconvenes in late October and could vote to topple Barak.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no agreement, Vedrine said, both sides will have to
''wait for a better moment'' and try again.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I do feel that in the absence of an agreement, the
backlash will be almost inevitable -- so we (have to) do everything
we can to avoid that happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A main crux of the problem is the Temple Mount, a holy site
known to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary. It is
built on the remains of the second Jewish Temple, sacked by the
Romans in 70 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said no Israeli leader would ever accept Palestinian
sovereignty over the Temple Mount -- ''a cornerstone of our
identity'' -- but suggested he would not necessarily insist on full
Israeli control over the sacred compound.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has said anything less than full Palestinian sovereignty
over all of traditionally Arab East Jerusalem, including
Jerusalem's walled Old City and its Muslim, Jewish and Christian
holy sites, is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   At this week's U.N. General Assembly debate following up on the
Millennium Summit, Arab ministers have backed the current peace
effort but insisted that Israel withdraw from occupied Arab
territories -- including East Jerusalem. In return for a full
Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said, Israel will ''be integrated as a partner
in the Middle East, enjoying rights to security, peace and
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moussa warned that if any Arab territory remains under
occupation or if any settlement is ''inconsistent with the
principles of right and justice, then that would constitute a time
bomb ready to explode at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Moussa said flexibility over Jerusalem ''cannot by any means
mean accepting Israeli sovereignty over the Holy Mosque-- Haram
as-Sharif -- but could instead mean arrangements for the new
Palestinian state to respect the holy sites, and guaranteeing free
access to them, and their protection.''

<HEADLINE> Two Dozen Treated After Japan Odor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A foul odor spread across a building housing bars
and restaurants in northern Japan early Thursday, sending 28 people
to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred in a nine-story building in Sapporo, a
city on the northern island of Hokkaido, the local fire department
said.
</P>
<P>
   The six men and 22 women who were hospitalized suffered eye pain
and coughing, Sapporo Fire Department spokesman Yoshitaka Suzuki.
Their injuries were not serious.
</P>
<P>
   Police and fire department officials later found brown liquid
residue on the building's fifth floor that emitted a bad smell.
Police were investigating the residue, Suzuki said, and had ruled
out a gas leak as the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has been particularly nervous about such incidents since
1995, when members of the Aum Shinri Kyo doomsday cult released
nerve gas on the Tokyo subway, killing 12 people and sickening
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Sapporo is 514 miles northwest of Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Clinton and Lazio first debate a testy affair  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - He called her ''Clintonesque.'' She
repeatedly linked him to Newt Gingrich. And both candidates for the
Senate accused the other of having ''chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Rick Lazio and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
faced off in their first debate Wednesday night, wielding
soundbite-sized insults, New York testiness and even an actual
prop.
</P>
<P>
   ''We New Yorkers don't back down from a fight,'' the Long Island
congressman boasted to a crowd of 200 supporters after the
hour-long debate, which aired nationally on cable.
</P>
<P>
   At a post-debate rally with about 1,500 supporters at a Buffalo
music hall, the first lady said she was relieved: ''It was my first
debate and I feel like I survived.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned into an often testy affair where Clinton repeatedly
attacked Lazio as a disciple of Gingrich, the conservative former
House speaker. Lazio, in turn, linked the first lady to the
policies and peccadilloes of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   The often sharp exchanges included one in which Lazio walked
across the stage to Clinton's podium and tried unsuccessfully to
get her to sign a pledge to bar soft money from their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   After having his pledge waved in her face, she told him ''that
was a wonderful performance.''
</P>
<P>
   He shot back, ''I'm not asking you to admire it, I'm asking you
to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Miringoff, head of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion,
described the debate as being ''very combative.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This was really rough stuff. They were in your face the whole
time,'' Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton found herself being asked if she wanted to apologize to
the American people for misleading them during the Monica Lewinsky
scandal when she blamed her husband's troubles on ''a vast
right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously I didn't mislead anyone. I didn't know the truth and
there's a great deal of pain associated with that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a very painful time for me, for my family, for our
country,'' Clinton said. ''It's something that I regret deeply that
anyone had to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio responded by saying, ''blaming others ... has become a
pattern for my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   And the congressman reacted sharply to Clinton's attempts to
link him to Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ''You, of all people, shouldn't try to make guilt by
association,'' he said. ''Newt Gingrich isn't running in this race,
I'm running in this race. Let's talk about my record.''
</P>
<P>
   He declared at one point that Clinton's education record as
first lady in Arkansas was dreadful and ''I don't think we need
that Little Rock record in the Big Apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob McClure, a Syracuse University political science professor,
said ''Hillary had to prove she didn't have horns. Rick had to
prove he had something between his ears. And both of them came out
of the debate with something.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the first lady and the congressman had sought to lower
expectations before the debate - she saying she had never done it
before and Lazio saying that while he had been in political
debates, ''this is a different league.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Decry Violence in Media  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Showing rough cuts of R-rated movies to test
audiences that include 10- or 12-year-olds is wrong and will stop,
Hollywood's top lobbyist promised senators concerned that the
movie, music and video game industries are marketing sex and
violence to children.
</P>
<P>
   But that was one of the few concessions entertainment industry
representatives made Wednesday as they defended the way they market
their products.
</P>
<P>
   Movie industry lobbyist Jack Valenti told the Senate Commerce
Committee that it was ''unavoidably wrong'' for movie executives to
show R-rated movies to focus groups including children as young as
10. The studios use such groups to see how a target audience will
react to a particular version of a film.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some marketing people stepped over the line of what is
acceptable,'' Valenti said of the children's focus groups, which
were detailed in a Federal Trade Commission report this week.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti and other entertainment executives balked, however, at
suggestions that they further police themselves to keep violent or
vulgar material out of the hands of kids.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe either government or any entertainment
industry committee has any business telling me and my wife what
entertainment our children should be exposed to,'' said Danny
Goldberg, president and chief executive officer of Artemis Records.
''So-called self-regulation achieved by political intimidation is
the equivalent of censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers at Wednesday's hearing, including Democratic vice
presidential hopeful Sen. Joseph Lieberman, denounced the nation's
movie, music and video game makers in the wake of the FTC report.
Senators said the voluntary labels each industry uses should be
made clearer, companies that market violence to children should be
sanctioned and the tax deduction for marketing might be removed for
ads that inappropriately target children.
</P>
<P>
   ''The day is fast approaching when the American people may be
willing to accept some restriction of freedom of expression in
order to protect their children,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.
''The entertainment industry must understand that we are closer to
that day than they may realize.''
</P>
<P>
   FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky said he had asked his staff to look
at whether the agency could sue entertainment companies for
child-targeted marketing of material that industry rating systems
say may be unsuitable for kids.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to sit around forever and wait for
self-regulation, but given a period of time, let's see if we can
find some progress there,'' Pitofsky said. ''If we don't, then I
think we ought to go to law enforcement and possibly legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti and other entertainment executives said any government
crackdown would be unwelcome and unconstitutional. While Valenti
pledged that Hollywood would stop targeting kids with ads for
violent, R-rated movies, he balked at suggestions that the
32-year-old movie rating system should be changed or enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be reluctant to get rid of something that works for some
mystical, one-size-fits-all proposal,'' Valenti said.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on media and the children was to continue Thursday,
when federal regulators were scheduled to devise new rules covering
the obligations of TV networks to youths. Broadcasters currently
are required to deliver three hours of educational children's shows
each week and must abide by certain advertising safeguards, in
exchange for free use of the nation's airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission was expected to expand
that requirement, since broadcasters have been given additional
digital channels worth tens of billions of dollars. The FCC also
plans October hearings to examine the amount of sex and violence on
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Music industry representatives at Wednesday's Senate hearing
strongly rejected suggestions that they should go beyond their
current rating system, which warns parents of ''explicit lyrics''
but does not include any more information.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have pictures. We don't have nudity. We don't have
blood,'' Goldberg said. ''All we have is words, and all we can do
is label the curse words.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., suggested that companies should lose
their tax exemption for marketing that targets an audience younger
than that recommended by voluntary industry rating systems. But
Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association, said
that would just cause the industry to drop all of its rating
systems rather than risk being penalized.

<HEADLINE> Plane carrying Pakistani ruler forced to return to JFK after bomb threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A jetliner carrying Pakistani military ruler
Pervez Musharraf returned to John F. Kennedy International Airport
late Wednesday because of a bomb threat.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was expected to be delayed by several hours, said
Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, who
spoke with The Associated Press by telephone after the plane
landed. Lodhi, who said she was with Musharraf during the
interview, confirmed that he had been aboard the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority spokesman Alan Hicks said Musharraf was safely
removed from the plane and was in a secure area of the airport
early Thursday. The 120 other passengers and crew that were on
board the Boeing 747 were also safely removed from the plane, and
were in the process of identifying their luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said a 911 call was received in New York at 9 p.m.
Wednesday, just as Pakistan International Airlines Flight 722 was
in position to take off. The call warned that three bombs had been
placed on the plane and that they were set to detonate upon
takeoff, Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was informed of the threat, but determined that it was
safe to take off because the plane and luggage had already been
swept by bomb-sniffing dog units of the New York Police Department,
the Port Authority Police Department and the Secret Service, Hicks
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane was flying near Boston, the pilot decided that the
plane should be re-examined and returned to Kennedy Airport. When
it landed in New York, at about 10:15 p.m., it was moved to a
remote area of the airport's tarmac, and all passengers were
removed from the plane, Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said the luggage, which was placed on the tarmac, was
being matched to the passengers and crew to make sure there were no
unclaimed pieces. Bomb-sniffing dogs would be used again after all
pieces were identified, Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected the passengers to re-board the plane once
the process was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan International Airlines Flight 722 was scheduled to fly
to Manchester, England, and then continue on to Karachi, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf took over the leadership of Pakistan last October
after the military deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a
bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf has vowed to cleanse the country's politics of
corruption before holding elections - a decision that has been
widely welcomed by people in Pakistan, though it has drawn
criticism abroad. Pakistan's Supreme Court has given the
military-led government three years to complete the task and return
the country to democracy.

<HEADLINE> Child Malnutrition Plagues Iraq  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- A U.N. report says child malnutrition remains a
serious problem in much of Iraq despite increases in food rations
in the country, which has been under U.N. sanctions for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization released the
report Wednesday, two days after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said in New York that Iraqi officials have refused to cooperate
with an investigation of the humanitarian situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's report was based on a mission to Iraq in May by
officials from FAO and two other U.N. agencies, the World Food
Program and the World Health Organization. The agencies said the
report was prepared for the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that two straight years of drought and
inadequate availability of seeds and other farming supplies
severely hurt Iraqi agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Annan had noted that under the U.N. oil-for-food program, which
allows Iraq to sell oil to help feed its population, Iraqi
officials have considerably increased the amount of food getting to
ordinary people. But, he said, the Baghdad government has indicated
it has no plans to cooperate with a panel of experts charged with
making a comprehensive report on the overall humanitarian situation
there.
</P>
<P>
   FAO officials in Rome could not say if Annan's remarks were
based on some of the report's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The May mission found that food rations are lacking in
vegetables, fruit and animal products and that monthly rations only
last up to three weeks. The mission urged Iraq for ''timely
submission of applications'' for food contracts, which then must be
approved by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. Sanctions can be lifted only after U.N. weapons inspectors
report that Baghdad is free of its weapons of mass destruction.

helicopters hovered overhead. A sign on the back of a car near
Lee's home said, ''Welcome home to your town, your garden and
Mozart.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered and clapped and broke into rounds of ''For
He's a Jolly Good Fellow'' as Lee beamed. They also gave a round of
applause to his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, was at the center of one of the nation's most important
government secrecy cases in years. He pleaded guilty Wednesday to a
single count of mishandling nuclear secrets and the government
dropped 58 other counts.
</P>
<P>
   After he'd been freed in Albuquerque, Lee told reporters: ''The
next few days, I'm going fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors apparently knew of his hobby. A couple of blocks from
the Lee house, Birgit and Patrick McGaughey hung out a sign that
said, ''Go Fish,'' and another proclaiming, ''A Bad Day Fishing is
Better Than a Good Day Working,'' next to a fishing pole.
</P>
<P>
   Once he arrived home, Lee changed from the suit he'd worn in
court into a blue polo shirt and slacks and went next door to a
party thrown by his longtime friends and Los Alamos National
Laboratory colleagues, Don and Jean Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy to be home. I'm so impressed with the big crowd
here,'' he told those gathered in the Marshalls' back yard. ''The
last nine months were pretty tough for me but I survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese food, cold cuts and fruit were spread out on a pingpong
table in the Marshalls' yard. Police cordoned off the neighborhood
for the block party.
</P>
<P>
   ''He needs the celebration -- we all need the celebration. The
tension has just been incredible,'' neighbor Mary Norris said.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Marshall said defense lawyers told Lee they were not going
to accept payment from him -- but they wanted a fishing trip and a
gourmet meal. She also urged journalists to ''get acquainted with
Wen Ho as we know him. He is a fun guy and you're going to love
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, meanwhile, has some catching up to do around the
house. Lee's son Chung said the family's yard could use some help
from his dad now that he's home.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a great landscaper so we'll try to get him busy on that.
And we'll definitely try to get him fishing,'' Chung Lee said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Lawyer Jailed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- A 77-year-old lawyer has been sentenced
to 14 years in jail for allegedly distributing foreign press
clippings with anti-government slogans written on the back, legal
sources in Myanmar said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng Poh, a well-known lawyer in Myanmar, was arrested in July.
He was sentenced Wednesday by a special court, the sources said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar's government was not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said state prosecutors accused Cheng Poh of copying
anti-government foreign media publications and distributing them
with statements written on the back, such as ''No Freedom, Our
Mouths Are Sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar, also known as Burma, is ruled by an unelected military
regime that faces widespread international censure for its human
rights record. It keeps a tight control on all media and is
intolerant of any dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the government closed down the headquarters
of the opposition National League for Democracy and put its top
nine leaders, including 1991 Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi,
under virtual house arrest. The government says the NLD is being
investigated for suspected links with terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The NLD won national elections in 1990 but was never allowed to
take office.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Guns Said Disappointing  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four powerful, expensive machine guns bought
to defend U.S.-made drug-fighting helicopters in Colombia have been
''a big disappointment,'' repeatedly malfunctioning and throwing
the aircraft off-balance, according to a U.S. Embassy cable.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department reluctantly bought the Gau-19 Gatling guns
at the urging of key Republicans and Colombian police. But just
months after being purchased for $2.1 million from General
Dynamics, the guns had all broken down and could not be used.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy cable, sent to the State Department last month,
described the .50-caliber weapons as ''temperamental'' and so
heavy, they ''can tip the aircraft dangerously forward.'' It said
they are so expensive to operate they threaten to ''eat up our
budget ... faster than it could possibly chew up
narco-terrorists.'' A copy of the cable was obtained The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The guns were bought to protect the U.S. Black Hawk helicopters
provided to Colombian anti-narcotics police. The helicopters often
face fire from heavily armed leftist guerrillas protecting cocaine
laboratories and coca fields.
</P>
<P>
   The guns' manufacturer, General Dynamics, sent a team to
Colombia this week to examine the problems and company spokesman
Kendell Pease said the guns would be operable very soon. He said
the weapon has a good track record and the Colombian air force has
used it without major problems.
</P>
<P>
   The staffs of two key House Republican chairmen suggested the
difficulties with the Gau-19 likely stem from faulty installation
and misuse.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen, Reps. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., and Dan Burton,
R-Ind., have been the leading advocates of the weapons and are
urging that more be bought in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Their aides say the Gau-19's rapid fire and large rounds are
needed to penetrate Colombia's dense jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other weapons tend to be just noisemakers that scare the
crows away,'' said John Mackey, an aide to Gilman, chairman of the
House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman and Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee, have repeatedly criticized Clinton administration
efforts in Colombia, accusing the State Department of trying to
foist unsafe, outdated equipment on the Colombian National Police.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about the Gau 19s come as the Clinton
administration is considering what weapons to buy for 60
helicopters -- Black Hawks and Hueys -- included in a new $1.3
billion U.S. aid package to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said the Gau-19 problems haven't been
a major setback to counternarcotics efforts because the helicopters
have been using other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy's Narcotics Affairs Section in Bogota
originally opposed the purchase of the Gau-19s because it didn't
want ''to be the guinea pig'' for what the cable described as an
''unproven item.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, however, acquiesced to the wishes of the
Colombian police and congressional staffers, said a senior
department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Hawks were altered to accommodate the Gau-19 at an
added cost of $541,000. Those alterations were approved by the
helicopters' manufacturer, Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy cable said the weight of the guns and ammunition
leave the helicopters off balance and the guns' electric control
boxes frequently burned out.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, their 2,000-round-per-minute fire rate made them
''incredibly expensive'' given that the .50-caliber ammunition can
cost up to $4 a round, the cable said.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey said the expense is justified given the value of the
helicopters they protect.
</P>
<P>
   He said the electrical problems may stem from the pairing of two
different machine guns on helicopters: the Gau-19, using AC
current, on one side and the smaller-caliber MK-44, using DC, on
the other. He said that may also explain the balance problems.
</P>
<P>
   A Sikorsky spokesman, William Tuttle, said the Black Hawks
should be able to accommodate the Gau-19s.
</P>
<P>
   Pease of General Dynamics said the Colombian air force has
bought 34 Gau-19s in recent years and hasn't had major problems.
</P>
<P>
   The air force guns were installed by General Dynamics; the
police guns were installed by contractors not supervised by the
company, he said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Near China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate was within grasp of approving
permanent normal trade status for China, a new relationship that
supporters hope will lead to the liberalization of China and the
enrichment of American businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., said that while the West has been
trading with China for centuries, ''it is not until now, until this
vote before us, that our country will have access to free and open
trade with this massive country called China.''
</P>
<P>
   Smooth passage of the bill appeared certain after the Senate on
Wednesday rejected, 65-32, an attempt by Sens. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., to attach language
strengthening sanctions on China and other countries that traffic
in weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   There was strong sentiment for legislation to punish China for
its weapons proliferation to Pakistan and other countries, but this
was outweighed by a consensus among lawyers that amending the trade
bill would result in its death in this session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least a half-dozen more amendments pending on such
issues as prison labor and human rights, but none appears close to
winning approval. The final vote, expected to garner at least 70
supporters, could come this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is voting on the bill passed by the House last May by
40 votes, and the concern is that the House would not have the time
or the will to consider any changes before Congress adjourns for
the year next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the PNTR (permanent normal trade relations) vote,''
said Sen. Max Baucus, a leading advocate of the trade legislation.
''Now that Thompson's done with there's nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearing this hurdle will most certainly give the green light
to the Senate to move quickly to pass PNTR and receive the economic
benefits of increased trade for the American economy,'' said Robert
Burt, chairman of the Business Roundtable, one of many major
business groups that has campaigned actively for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Allard explained the lure to American businesses: ''China has
1.3 billion people, a purchasing power of $4.42 trillion and a
yearly import market of $140 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Thompson measure, the Senate on Wednesday defeated
six proposed amendments. The closest vote, 53-43, came on language
from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., asking the president to urge China
to end forced abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of permanent trade status took on urgency this year as
China engaged in final negotiations for its entry into the World
Trade Organization. If the United States does not extend permanent
status, American exporters would not be eligible for the
significantly lower tariffs China has agreed to as part of its
entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's amendment would have strengthened monitoring of
China's weapons proliferation, required non-trade-related sanctions
on companies and individuals that violate proliferation agreements
and set up procedures for the Securities and Exchange Commission to
make public those proliferators investing in U.S. capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said administration efforts to curb Chinese
proliferation ''would be subverted -- and existing programs could be
reversed -- by this mandatory sanctions bill which would single out
companies based on an unreasonably low standard of suspicion,
instead of proof.''
</P>
<P>
   He said passage of the trade bill would ''help ensure our
economic prosperity, reinforce our work on human rights and enhance
our national security.''
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed trade bill does contain some provisions dealing
with U.S. concerns with the Beijing government. It gives relief to
American industries and workers hit by a surge in Chinese imports,
creates a commission to monitor human rights in China and addresses
issues relating to the importing of goods made in Chinese forced
labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4444.

<HEADLINE> Explosion at Jakarta Stock Exchange  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The death toll from the car bombing
and fire at the Jakarta Stock Exchange rose to 15 on Thursday as
speculation mounted that supporters of ex-dictator Suharto might be
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated that escalating violence is destabilizing his
year-old reformist administration, President Abdurrahman Wahid
demanded quick arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the police chief and the attorney general not to
hesitate to act against suspects regardless of their position or
status,'' Cabinet Secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak quoted Wahid as
saying during an emergency Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's blast rocked the capital's downtown financial
district -- the day before a court resumed its hearing into charges
of corruption against the former president. And bombings have
coincided with every major stage of a state investigation against
Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years until violent
demonstrations forced him to quit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bombing ''could be a terrorist act because the way it
went off was similar to other bombs that exploded moments before or
after the former president's investigation and trial,'' National
Police Chief Gen. Rusdihardjo was quoted as saying by The Jakarta
Post.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's lawyers refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the proceedings in Suharto's case resumed Thursday in
a south Jakarta court, with a five-judge panel asking doctors
whether the former leader -- 79 years old and the victim of three
strokes -- is fit for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's 23-doctor medical team was in court, all in white
hospital coats. Three of the physicians testified that the strokes
had damaged the former autocrat's brain. He also suffers from
hypertension, kidney stones, heart problems and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The next threat to his health, which could include any
stressful event, will worsen other previous ailments,'' said Teguh
Ranahkusuma, the head of Suharto's medical team. ''The next threat
will be fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   Government physicians say Suharto is fit enough to face court.
The former president's attorneys have suggested that if the courts
cannot decide which medical opinion is correct, they should seek
the opinion of independent foreign physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, Jakarta police spokesman Lt. Col. Nur Usman said
rescuers had recovered all the bodies from the stock exchange
building's burned-out underground garage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the dead, at least 27 people were injured, some
critically. The blast damaged or destroyed 400 vehicles in the
three-level garage filled with cars and drivers waiting for their
stockbroker bosses to finish work.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dead suffocated in thick black smoke. Some were
found in the charred remains of their vehicles. Smoke filled the
exchange's trading room and other offices, forcing the evacuation
of about 1,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred without warning 45 minutes before the
markets closed. Hours before the afternoon explosion, the stock
market's main index hit a 12-month low. After the blast, trading
was suspended until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing was a major blow to Wahid's efforts to restore
confidence in Indonesia's crisis-ridden economy and end violence
across the world's fourth-most populous nation.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Airlines Jet Returns To JFK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A jet carrying Pakistan's military ruler and 120
other people bound for England and Pakistan was forced to return to
John F. Kennedy International Airport after a bomb threat.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported. The threat was received by telephone
after Pakistan International Airlines Flight 722 left the airport
Wednesday night, Port Authority spokesman Alan Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane bound for Manchester, England, and then Karachi turned
around and landed without incident.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, was on the
plane, said Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan's ambassador to the United
States who was with him in New York. She said the flight was
expected to be delayed three to four hours.
</P>
<P>
   A call Wednesday night to a 911 dispatcher in New York warned
that three bombs had been placed on the plane and would detonate
upon takeoff, Hicks said. The call was received as the plane was in
position to take off, Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was informed of the threat but decided it was safe to
take off because the plane and luggage had already been swept by
bomb-sniffing dogs, Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane was flying near Boston, the pilot decided the
aircraft should be re-examined and returned to Kennedy Airport.
When it landed in New York, it was moved to a remote area of the
airport's tarmac and all passengers were taken off the plane, Hicks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the jet and the luggage would be checked again
by dog teams for explosives. The passengers were expected to
re-board the plane once that process was completed, Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf took over the leadership of Pakistan last October
after the military deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a
bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf has vowed to cleanse the country's politics of
corruption before holding elections -- a decision that has been
widely welcomed by people in Pakistan, though it has drawn
criticism abroad. Pakistan's Supreme Court has given the
military-led government three years to complete the task and return
the country to democracy.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani: Before you drink bottled water, sniff it  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Authorities were investigating whether three
incidents in which people were sickened after drinking contaminated
bottled water were the result of tampering.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, joined
by Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik and members of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, said all three victims had recovered after
being treated at area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said New Yorkers should not be alarmed, but warned that
people should be especially careful in drinking bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make sure that you open the bottle yourself,'' he said. ''And
you actually hear it, and you hear the noise and the air coming
out.'' Giuliani added that people should open their own bottles of
water in restaurants and that they should sniff it before drinking.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 3, a woman felt a burning sensation in her throat and
began bleeding from the mouth after drinking bottled water in a
restaurant. Tests on the water showed that it contained ''some type
of sodium hydroxide,'' Kerik said. Kerik described it as a ''strong
cleaning agent'' or a ''lye-type agent.''
</P>
<P>
   A man who drank from a bottle of water purchased from a midtown
deli on Aug. 27 felt a burning sensation in his throat. The water
was found to contain ammonia.
</P>
<P>
   The last case was on Sept. 6, when a woman gave her 18-month-old
son a sip of bottled water purchased from a takeout restaurant. The
baby became ill and the water turned out to be tainted with
ammonia.
</P>
<P>
   All three cases involved different brands of water.

<HEADLINE> Fashions Sizzle at Latin Grammys  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Jennifer Lopez effect dominated fashion
at the inaugural Latin Grammy Awards: The less you wore, the more
attention you drew.
</P>
<P>
   Jaws dropped earlier this year when the actress-singer appeared
at the traditional Grammy awards show in February in a now-infamous
Versace gown, which opened in a deep V all the way to her navel.
</P>
<P>
   This time Christina Aguilera, Colombian songstress Shakira and
Latin rocker Alejandra Guzman pushed the boundaries of what they
can show off in public.
</P>
<P>
   Their shimmering skintight gowns revealed more than they
covered.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera arrived at the Staples Center in a sequined
midriff-baring gown cut to the hip and held up by tiny straps made
of silver chains. Like many performers, she changed for her
performance, choosing a candy-apple red miniskirt and long sleeve
midriff-baring top.
</P>
<P>
   Shakira also sported bright red, with tight pants wrapped in
dangling charms and a cleavage-baring backless top.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman, a nominee for best female rock performance, wore a
revealing two-piece outfit by Dolce and Gabbana, which was covered
in purple and green sequins.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who started it all, meanwhile, appeared downright
modest. At the Latin Grammys, Lopez wore a satiny floor-length gown
with a bejeweled neck-strap.
</P>
<P>
   Blue hair, once the color of choice for frumpy ladies, also took
on a whole new style at the show.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera highlighted her blonde tresses with sapphire, and
Cuban-American salsa singer Celia Cruz drew cheers for her
electrified azure locks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tito Puente Jr. wore an ankle-length leather ensemble
and members of the salsa boy-band Son by Four draped themselves
from top to bottom in heavy wool and leather.
</P>
<P>
   Puente, a salsa musician whose legendary bandleader father was
honored during the show's opening musical number, attended the
Latin Grammys in one of the more eyebrow-raising outfits. He wore
shiny leather pants and a matching cloak locked across the chest
with silver buckles.
</P>
<P>
   Son by Four vocalist Angel Lopez arrived in a wool parka spotted
with patches of brown fur, but changed into black leather for his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the pop group 'N Sync, who performed with Son by
Four, arrived in iridescent blue-tinted suits that matched in color
but varied slightly in style.
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync singer Justin Timberlake showed off his swirling designs
of purple and dark green before hurrying into the arena to prepare
for his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my Latin flavor!'' he yelled, as a crowd of cheering
teen-age girls roared with approval across the street.

<HEADLINE> Estefan, Miguel, Win Latin Awards  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There were paparazzi, a red carpet and
big-name stars like Jennifer Lopez, but there also were charro
outfits and obscure Argentine rockers.
</P>
<P>
   As the first multilingual event ever broadcast live during prime
time on network TV, the Latin Grammys signaled a major breakthrough
for Hispanic culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''These prizes are very, very important,'' said Mercedes Sosa,
the Argentinian folk star who won a Latin Grammy for best folk
album. ''For the first time, popular music of Latin America is
being recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   Legendary guitarist Carlos Santana, who dominated the regular
awards in February with eight Grammys, took home three trophies
Wednesday in the inaugural awards show, including the top prize,
best album.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran rocker's duet with Mexican rockers Mana, ''Corazon
Espinado,'' won record of the year seven months after another
Santana song, ''Smooth,'' won the same honor at the other Grammy
Awards. He also won for rock performance by a duo or group with
vocal and for best pop instrumental performance.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican crooner Luis Miguel also won three awards, including
album of the year for ''Amarte Es Un Placer.'' Mana won one award
in addition to its two with Santana.
</P>
<P>
   Santana, who alternately dedicated his awards to Africa, the
women of the world, bilingual education and Nelson Mandela, said
winning so often doesn't make him jaded.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels like the first kiss,'' he said. ''It feels very
natural and divine and human.''
</P>
<P>
   As at any awards show, starlets sauntered through in plunging
necklines and hunky singers smiled for the cameras as teen-age fans
screamed in delight.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other awards shows, a blue-wigged Celia Cruz, the
Queen of Salsa, shrieked ''Mi Madre!'' upon winning and delivered
an ecstatic acceptance speech in Spanish. Cruz won for best salsa
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Also rarely seen on prime time: Spanish-language exhortations
about Latin unity from long-haired Mexican performers Mana and an
awards presentation by Argentine rocker Fito Paez.
</P>
<P>
   Shakira, honored for best female vocal and best female rock
performance, saluted her native country: ''This is for you,
Colombia. Para ti Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade of performers trading jokes, thanking family members
and paying tribute in Spanish and Portuguese on national television
was more proof the Latin music boom is there to stay.
</P>
<P>
   There was controversy: Many winners and telecast performers were
familiar names like Gloria Estefan, 'N Sync and Christina Aguilera,
and the perception that commercial music was favored at the expense
of distinctive Mexican styles such as norteno and tejano caused
some grumbling leading into the awards.
</P>
<P>
   The largest Latin record label in the United States, Fonovisa,
boycotted the awards. Mariachi star Pepe Aguilar, nominated for
best ranchero performance, also refused to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Some guests, though, sought to downplay the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before people talk they should get educated,'' said Emilio
Estefan Jr., who is married to singer Gloria Estefan and was
nominated for six awards for his work as a producer for various
artists. ''I was very disappointed about that. ... I hope these
awards will unite people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,600 academy members from 15 countries voted for the
nominees in 40 categories. Nominated music was required to be 51
percent Spanish or Portuguese-language music.
</P>
<P>
   The awards were started by an offshoot of the National Academy
of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences, which produces the Grammys, to
capitalize on a growing interest in Latin music. The academy hopes
the show will travel to a new country each year, Olympics-style.
</P>
<P>
   A hip-swiveling Ricky Martin, paying tribute to the late mambo
king Tito Puente, opened the telecast. Puente, who died in June,
won an award for best tropical performance.
</P>
<P>
   The academy named a Cuban singer in his 70s, Ibrahim Ferrer, as
its best new artist. He came to prominence recently through his
work on the ''Buena Vista Social Club'' album.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour ceremony was televised on CBS and was seen in more
than 120 other countries.

<HEADLINE> Indian Leader To Talk With Congress  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a warmup for talks Friday with President
Clinton, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is touching
base with members of Congress as he opens an official visit.
</P>
<P>
   After an address Thursday to a joint session of Congress,
Vajpayee planned a meeting with the House International Relations
Committee for an exchange of views on India's controversial nuclear
policies and on the continuing dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. relations with India have come a long way since the Cold
War days despite lingering disagreements over India's decision to
carry out nuclear tests two years ago and its refusal to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the U.N. Millennium Summit last week, Vajpayee
said India had to take up the nuclear option although it preferred
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ''The spread of nuclear weapons in our neighborhood made us
especially vulnerable,'' Vajpayee said in reference to Pakistan,
which also conducted nuclear tests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   During his stay here, Vajpayee also was expected to ask for
support for Indian membership in the U.N. Security Council. He also
was expected to voice his concerns about the U.S. sanctions imposed
after the nuclear tests that have not been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say Clinton wants to build on what they
regard as Clinton's successful visit to India in March.
</P>
<P>
   Kanti Bajpai, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution,
said Clinton's visit ''was a grand psychological and political
success, and there has never been a better time for an Indian
leader to deal and deliberate with Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of 52 years since independence, India and the United
States were on opposite sides of the Cold War divide, a situation
Vajpayee sees as an anomaly. The world's two largest democracies,
he has said, should be natural allies.

<HEADLINE> Speculation Mounts in Jakarta  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Rock-throwing protesters took to the
streets Thursday as speculation mounted that supporters of
ex-dictator Suharto might be responsible for a car bombing and fire
that killed 15 people at the Jakarta Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated that escalating violence is destabilizing his
year-old reformist administration, President Abdurrahman Wahid
demanded quick arrests for in Wednesday's attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the police chief and the attorney general not to
hesitate to act against suspects regardless of their position or
status,'' Cabinet Secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak quoted Wahid as
saying during an emergency Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The blast rocked the capital's downtown financial district -- the
day before a court resumed its hearing into charges of corruption
against the former president. Bombings have also coincided with
every major stage of a state investigation against Suharto, who
ruled Indonesia for 32 years until violent demonstrations forced
him to quit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bombing ''could be a terrorist act because the way it
went off was similar to other bombs that exploded moments before or
after the former president's investigation and trial,'' National
Police Chief Gen. Rusdihardjo was quoted as saying by The Jakarta
Post.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's lawyers refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the bomber used a military-type explosive identical
to one used in another car bombing at the Philippine ambassador's
house in Jakarta last month. Two people died in that attack and
dozens were hurt, including the ambassador. Indonesian officials
blamed Philippine Muslim rebels, but made no arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the proceedings in Suharto's case resumed Thursday in
a south Jakarta court.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered an independent medical team to determine
whether Suharto, who has had three strokes, is fit to stand trial.
Chief judge Lalu Mariyun also ordered the disgraced 79-year-old
former despot to attend the next hearing, set for Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Three members of Suharto's 23-doctor medical team -- all of whom
were in the courtroom, in white hospital coats -- testified that the
strokes had damaged the former autocrat's brain. He also suffers
from hypertension, kidney stones, heart problems and diabetes.
Government physicians say Suharto is healthy enough to face trial.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, several dozen anti-Suharto demonstrators threw stones
at buses carrying about 100 supporters of the old strongman. The
groups gathered later near Suharto's residence, and riot police to
eventually fired tear gas to disperse them.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, Jakarta police spokesman Lt. Col. Nur Usman said
rescuers had recovered all the bodies from the stock exchange
building's burned-out underground garage.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from the attack rose to 15 Thursday. At least 27
people were injured, some critically. The blast damaged or
destroyed 400 vehicles in the three-level garage filled with cars
and drivers waiting for their stockbroker bosses to finish work.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility, and Wahid ordered Indonesia's
military commander to join the police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dead suffocated in thick black smoke. Some were
found in the charred remains of their vehicles. Smoke filled the
exchange's trading room and other offices, forcing the evacuation
of about 1,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred without warning 45 minutes before the
markets closed. Hours before the afternoon explosion, the stock
market's main index hit a 12-month low. After the blast, trading
was suspended until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing was a major blow to Wahid's efforts to restore
confidence in Indonesia's crisis-ridden economy and end violence
across the world's fourth-most populous nation.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Security Restrictions Lifted  </HEADLINE>
By AYE AYE WIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Myanmar's military government lifted
security restrictions Thursday on democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi
and eight other opposition leaders who had been confined to their
homes for the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition leaders ''are no longer required to stay at their
respective residences'' and have been allowed to resume ''their
daily activities as usual,'' a government statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy said it will test the
government's sincerity on Friday, when the party reopens its
headquarters, which had also been shut by the government as part of
the restrictions since Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   NLD vice chairman Tin Oo, freed from home by the lifting of
restrictions, was among the first people to visit Suu Kyi at her
lakeside residence.
</P>
<P>
   He said party leaders will once again try to travel outside the
capital, Yangon, for party work. The previous attempt by Suu Kyi
and Tin Oo to drive to the town of Kungyangone had led to the
security crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will find out if we will be allowed freedom of movement. We
will travel again because we did not reach Kungyangone last time.
So we will try again,'' Tin Oo told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi, Tin Oo and a group of party youth members were blocked
by security forces outside Yangon on Aug. 24 and ordered to go
back. They refused and camped out beside their vehicle for nine
days before police forcibly transported them back to Yangon.
Subsequently, Suu Kyi, Tin Oo and seven other party leaders were
confined to their homes under virtual house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   During their confinement, the leaders were not allowed any
visitors and their phone lines were cut.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, U.S. charge d'affaires Priscilla Clapp went to the
home of Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her
pro-democracy work here. Suu Kyi told Clapp that the NLD has been
allowed to resume party work, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are back in business to the extent they can do business
in this country,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Security officers were removed Thursday from outside NLD
headquarters, as well as the houses of Tin Oo and treasurer Nyunt
Wai. Tin Oo's home telephone was also restored.
</P>
<P>
   Tin Oo said the government lifted the restrictions ''partly
because of international pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest restrictions on Suu Kyi's movements drew vehement
international criticism, mainly by the United States and Britain.
They accused the regime of blatantly violating the Myanmar
democracy leader's political rights. The government justified the
restrictions by saying it was investigating what it says are the
party's links with terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's government statement expressed its appreciation for
the cooperation of senior NLD members in staying at home as
requested during the investigation. It said the government regrets
''the inconvenience caused to those involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her
peaceful struggle for democracy in Myanmar, also known as Burma,
which has been ruled by its military since 1962. She spent six
years under house arrest, from 1989 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The current crop of generals came to power in 1988 after a
bloody crackdown on a nationwide uprising for civilian rule. The
uprising catapulted Suu Kyi to political prominence. In 1990, the
NLD won national elections but was prevented by the military regime
from taking power.
</P>
<P>
   In another development Thursday, NLD chairman Aung Shwe met with
the third-ranking general in the government, Khin Nyunt, who is the
secretary-one of the ruling State Peace and Development Council,
diplomats said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had a fruitful meeting,'' Khin Nyunt was quoted as
saying in the government statement. No further details were
available of the rare meeting between the NLD and the regime.

<HEADLINE> China Blasts U.S. Missile Proposal  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- China urged disarmament negotiators Thursday to
consider the ''grave consequences'' of U.S. plans for a national
missile defense system, dismissing President Clinton's deferral of
a decision to deploy it.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia have been leading voices denouncing the idea of
a limited U.S. shield against missile attack from countries like
Iraq and North Korea. They maintain that it would undermine
arms-control and disarmament treaties already in effect, in
particular the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton earlier this month decided not to authorize the National
Missile Defense, leaving the decision to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   But the deferral ''does not mean at all that the NMD plan has
been given up,'' Chinese Ambassador Hu Xiaodi told delegates at the
66-nation Conference on Disarmament here. He cited ''the grave
consequences of the development and deployment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. president has instructed the continued development
and testing of NMD,'' he said. ''The international community should
be clear about this fact.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats rejected the Chinese comments, suggesting that
China and others are using objections to the NMD as a smoke screen
to create ''utter paralysis'' blocking disarmament negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been pressing for years for negotiations
on a treaty banning the production of ''fissile materials'' --
plutonium and highly enriched uranium -- needed to make nuclear
weapons. Washington maintains that negotiations on outer space are
a nonstarter and are blocking work on the fissile material ban.
Western diplomats have suggested that China, with a much smaller
nuclear arsenal than Russia or the United States, wants to avoid a
ban on fissile materials.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Washington maintains, the NMD would be land-based
and would have no impact on armaments in space.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm puzzled at the intensity of the concerns that have been
expressed,'' U.S. Ambassador Robert T. Grey said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected Chinese suggestions the United States was trying to
control the world and added a pointed dig: ''The era of empires is
over, as is the era of one-party states.''
</P>
<P>
   Grey stressed that Washington believes proposed amendments to
the ABM treaty would update rather than destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the ABM regime were to fail, the responsibility for that
and for all the results that might ensue would rest with those who
were insisting the regime had to remain static and could not be
adapted to meet current realities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, the world's main multilateral disarmament forum,
ends its annual session next week.
</P>
<P>
   The conference has been deadlocked on starting any new
negotiations since it wrote the treaty to ban nuclear test
explosions in 1996. This year's session has been dominated by
rancorous exchanges over the NMD project.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing on Thursday, Chinese and U.S. arms negotiators held
the first of two days of talks as part of a renewed dialogue aimed
at curbing China's suspected transfer of missile technology to
Pakistan and other countries. Those talks resumed in July after a
19-month interruption.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal Urges Immigration Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- A cardinal has urged Italy to favor Catholic
immigrants over Muslim ones in order to ''save the nation's
identity'' against ''Islam's ideological attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before some 200 priests at his Bologna archdiocese
Wednesday, Cardinal Giacomo Biffi said that the church today faces
''one of the most serious and biggest assaults on Christianity that
history remembers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Italy is not a deserted land with no history or traditions ...
that can be populated at random,'' Biffi, who is known for his
conservative positions, said in the pastoral letter.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Rome newspaper La Repubblica, the cardinal in
the past has mentioned Latin Americans, Eritreans and Filipinos as
those who should be given priority in Italy's immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
   Biffi's remarks sparked protests from some Catholic and
left-wing politicians. Many considered the cardinal's position in
contrast to that of Pope John Paul II, who has reached out to other
religions throughout his 22-year papacy.
</P>
<P>
   The government's minister for social solidarity, Livia Turco,
told La Repubblica that ''building walls against Islam is
irresponsible,'' and that it ''doesn't do justice to a pope who has
been professing ecumenism.''
</P>
<P>
   In overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Italy, with a population around
58 million, there are 1.2 million Muslims, Turco said.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-immigration Northern League was among those welcoming
the cardinal's words.
</P>
<P>
   ''After Biffi, nobody can define immigration as a positive,
necessary and unchangeable fact,'' said the Northern League's Mario
Borghezio, who said the cardinal's ''authoritative words break a
taboo.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi said Thursday that Biffi's
words ''deserve attention,'' according to the ANSA news agency.
</P>
<P>
   At a European synod at the Vatican last year, several bishops
sounded an alarm about Islam making inroads into Europe as
increasing numbers of immigrants arrive.

<HEADLINE> Reno 'Comfortable' With Lee Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno, saying she is
''comfortable'' with the handling of the Wen Ho Lee case, refused
to apologize Thursday to the former Los Alamos laboratory scientist
for his nine-month detention.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she wished ''with all my heart and soul'' that Lee
early on had provided investigators with information about seven
missing computer tapes that contained nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Dr. Lee, from the beginning, had the opportunity to
answer this and I think now he needs to look to himself,'' rather
than expect an apology from the U.S. government, she said at her
weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was set free Wednesday by U.S. District Judge James Parker
in Albuquerque, N.M. In a tongue lashing of government officials,
Parker said the scientist's lengthy detention ''embarrassed our
entire nation and each of us who is a citizen of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's criticism came as he accepted an agreement that
freed Lee, who pleaded guilty to a single count of mishandling
nuclear secrets. In exchange, the government dropped 58 other
counts of breaching national security.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said federal prosecutors ''had tried from the beginning''
to learn what Lee did with the tapes, which he acknowledged he had
transferred from a highly secure computer at the Los Alamos nuclear
weapons lab into unsecured personal files.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no explanation of what the man did with the
information that was so sensitive,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno went through a point-by-point defense of the government's
handling of the case a day after she and FBI Director Louis J.
Freeh released statements in which they emphasized that getting Lee
to acknowledge having transferred the nuclear secrets was a top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am comfortable with that,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   At her news conference, Reno said anew that the scientist likely
would have avoided the jail time had he cooperated in assuring that
the tapes had not fallen into unauthorized hands. Lee has claimed
all along that he destroyed the seven tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, a computer scientist at Los Alamos since 1980, was
indicted in December on 59 counts of mishandling secrets, and on
the government's insistence was refused bail. Prosecutors argued
that freeing him might give him the opportunity to dispose of the
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said federal prosecutors had long hoped that Lee ''could
tell us if he had conveyed any information from the tapes'' and had
suggested that if he was cooperative, ''we would reconsider
detention. In this instance, we have now what we tried to do
then.''

<HEADLINE> Gates Visits Kids During India Trip  </HEADLINE>
By NEELESH MISRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Bill Gates, on a 24-hour trip to India,
gave polio vaccine to squealing children at a clinic Thursday and
said he was using more of his wealth to fight disease in developing
counties.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in a Mercedes at the polio clinic, which was
ringed with dozens of security guards, the Microsoft chairman and
world's richest man squeezed drops from a small bottle into the
mouths of 30 children and held their heads as they shook and yanked
at their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't like the taste, I don't think. Does it taste
funny?'' Gates said as he fed the medicine and an infant squirmed
in his mother's arms. He sat on an old, wooden bench in a doctor's
room, wearing blue trousers and a light blue shirt with small
checks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Very cute,'' he said of some children. ''They really got
dressed up for this. You all look very nice this morning.'' A
volunteer translated the sentences to the women and children, all
from poor families.
</P>
<P>
   India has been home to almost half the polio cases in the world,
but health officials say the disease is now set to be wiped out in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the mothers at the clinic had never heard of Gates, who
is on a daylong visit to India to join celebrations marking 10
years of his company's operations in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, Gates announced an alliance with India's
emerging information technology giant, Infosys Technologies, for
developing and delivering a portfolio of Infosys business solutions
on the Microsoft .Net platform.
</P>
<P>
   At the clinic, Gates joined his hands in a traditional Indian
greeting and bowed. He inquired about the red mark that married
Indian women apply on their foreheads, and asked whether most of
the women present in the large room wore veils in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''No wedding ring,'' he said as he noticed their hands, and
laughed. Many Indian women do not wear wedding rings.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has provided a $750
million gift to start a fund to fight diseases, Gates told The
Associated Press in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of all the money that I am giving away toward health, a lot of
it is focused on developing countries. ... India features in a lot
of the things that we think about doing,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People probably expect me to focus mostly on giving away
computers and stuff, and I do quite a bit of that, but I have
decided that what is most important is people having healthy
children,'' Gates said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   His foundation, which will award two grants totaling $30 million
for children and students in India, is helping international
agencies like UNICEF and the World Health Organization eradicate
polio by the year 2005 -- described as the biggest health campaign
ever, involving 10 million workers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   More than 470 million children were immunized across the world
last year, 147 million of them in India.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Challenger Gets Pelted  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) --Slobodan Milosevic's
supporters threw stones, eggs and tomatoes at his strongest
challenger in upcoming elections, striking him in the face as he
tried to address a rally Thursday in this divided Kosovo city.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in Kosovska Mitrovica was intended to be a moment of
glory for Vojislav Kostunica, who was touring the isolated Serb
enclaves in a bid to win votes. Instead, the soft-spoken law
professor faced a mostly male crowd largely uninterested in the
message that he was the man who could beat Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Milosevic) put you up to this -- God will forgive you but
God will not forgive him,'' Kostunica managed to say to his
attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards tried to shelter him from the melee and
surrounded him as he tried to speak. After a few futile attempts to
speak, the bodyguards then pushed him off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's supporters then grew more violent, attacking
Kostunica's convoy and smashing windshields. Kostunica was hit with
a rock below his eye, but the cut did not appear serious.
Bodyguards managed to pull him away.
</P>
<P>
   Riots are common in Kosovska Mitrovica, a town divided by the
Ibar River into a southern ethnic Albanian side and a predominantly
Serb northern part. Thursday's action, however, pitted Serb against
Serb.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of Sept. 24 elections, Serbia is radically polarized
between Milosevic's supporters and those who oppose the autocratic
ruler. This also applies to Kosovo's Serbs. Despite a strong
following for Kostunica among the dwindling Serb population,
hard-liners and thugs retain a firm footing in this city 25 miles
north from the capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of Kosovo Serbs, Oliver Ivanovic, blamed Milosevic's
forces for causing Thursday's trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was evidently a setup, a planned action and to our dismay
we had no previous knowledge of the plan and got trapped,'' Oliver
Ivanovic told The Associated Press. He called Kostunica ''the only
Serb politician who really took to heart the plight of our people
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica had been sweeping through northern Kosovo in a
Western-style campaign tour. It was his first visit to the
U.N.-administered province during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Though Milosevic has pledged to travel to this seat of Serb
nationalism, NATO leaders have promised to arrest him on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The top U.N. administrator in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, told the
French weekly Le Nouvel Observateur that he was concerned over the
elections, since the balloting ''dones not meet international
criteria.'' But he admitted the U.N. administration could do
nothing to stop it. Kosovo is still recognized as part of Serbia --
Yugoslavia's main republic -- even though the province is run by the
United Nations and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no voter lists'' for the election, and ''the votes
will be counted outside of Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In past votes, Kosovo has proven to be a repository of stolen
ballots. No census has taken place in this province for more than a
decade and the number of eligible voters is not known.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Official To Visit S.Korea  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea has reaffirmed a promised
visit to South Korea by the North's leader, Kim Jong Il, saying the
communist state's No. 2 man will visit South Korea soon to prepare
for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came Thursday during a 4&AMP;frac12;-hour meeting between Kim
Yong Sun, a special envoy of the North Korean leader, and his South
Korean counterpart, Lim Dong-won.
</P>
<P>
   Without specifying a date, a joint statement said the North
Korean leader will visit South Korea ''in the near future.''
Unconfirmed local news reports have said Kim Jong Il will visit
Seoul next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The joint statement said Kim Yong Nam, president of the
Presidium of the North's Supreme People's Assembly, will visit
Seoul ahead of Kim Jong Il's visit. Kim Yong Nam serves as a
ceremonial head of state for the isolated North.
</P>
<P>
   The talks between the North Korean emissary and Lim also
produced a series of agreements aimed at further advancing a recent
thaw in relations between the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   South and North Korea will hold a Red Cross meeting Wednesday on
the scenic Diamond Mountain on the North's east coast to discuss
two more reunions of separated families by year's end, the joint
statement said. The two Koreas each allowed 100 people to cross the
Demilitarized Zone, the world's most heavily fortified border, in
August for temporary reunions with families they haven't seen since
the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Also, officials from both sides will meet Sept. 25 in Seoul to
sign accords to guarantee investment and avoid double taxation.
Such accords are essential to encouraging South Korean investments
in North Korea, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the sides apparently made little progress on military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The joint statement simply reiterated an earlier agreement that
the two sides were still discussing opening the first meeting
between their defense ministers. South Korea had hoped to hold the
proposed defense chiefs' talks late this month to discuss
tension-easing measures, such as a military hot line to prevent
accidental armed skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
   The communist North's 1.1 million hard-line armed forces are
considered one of the biggest obstacles to promoting reconciliation
on the divided Korean Peninsula. Up to 2 million battle-ready
troops face each other across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun, the North Korean envoy, arrived here Monday on a
four-day trip to follow up on a historic summit between Kim Jong Il
and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung in June. During the summit,
the two leaders agreed to work together for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun paid a courtesy call on the Southern president on
Thursday. He returned home later in the day through the border
village of Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il had promised to visit Seoul in return for Kim
Dae-jung's visit to Pyongyang in June. No North Korean head of
state has visited Seoul, and Kim's planned trip would be a new
milestone in improving ties.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean Peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
pro-Western South Korea in 1945. Their war in the early 1950s ended
without a peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Police Raid Opposition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Detectives and intelligence agents
escorted by armed paramilitary police raided offices of the main
opposition party Thursday, arresting two officials.
</P>
<P>
   A search warrant handed to the opposition party, the Movement
for Democratic Change, said police suspected three buildings in
Harare were used by the opposition to store ''arms of war.'' No
weapons were found, party secretary-general Welshman Ncube said.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition viewed the raids as a pretext to seize
information on party strategies ahead of presidential elections
next year and details of its funds so supporters and donors could
be targeted for harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''That must be one of the reasons behind this nonsensical
operation,'' Ncube said.
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The raids came three months after the opposition party won 57 of
120 elected seats in parliamentary elections in June. The results
of the vote posed the biggest challenge to President Robert
Mugabe's hold on power since he led the nation to independence in
1980. In the outgoing parliament, Mugabe's ruling party controlled
all but three seats.
</P>
<P>
   At least 31 people died and thousands were left homeless in
political violence ahead of the elections. Most of the victims were
opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Around dawn Thursday, police raided the party headquarters north
of the city center, an administrative support center in downtown
Harare and offices in the southern suburb of St. Martins around
dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Join Nkhatazo, the party's chief security officer, and an
assistant, Socks Ncube, were arrested and taken to Harare's main
police station for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers acting for the opposition prevented police from
scrutinizing documents and reading computer files in the searches,
which continued for several hours, Welshman Ncube said.
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate David Manguta's warrant allowed police to search only
for suspected weapons listed as grenades, pistols, rifles and tear
gas canisters.
</P>
<P>
   Uniformed police armed with automatic weapons remained at the
opposition offices, and Ncube said party officials suspected that
police were seeking a further warrant to seize documents and
computer data.
</P>
<P>
   Police at the downtown offices accused youth leader Nelson
Chamisa and Gandi Mudzingwa, a personal assistant to opposition
leader Morgan Tsvangirai, of gun running. Tsvangirai is out of the
country on party business.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, a grenade was hurled into the yard of the
opposition headquarters. No one was injured, and no one claimed
responsibility for the grenade attack.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Veterans Recall Korean Landing  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   INCHON, South Korea (AP) -- In the moonless wee hours 50 years
ago, U.S. Navy warships and Marines navigated a narrow, muddy
channel to face enemies on the shore of this west coast port.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was something we had to do,'' retired Navy Capt. Robert
Schelling, of Seattle said matter-of-factly. ''We had a little more
fortune than they did.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, dozens of graying U.S. sailors and Marines gathered
at the Inchon Amphibious Operation Memorial Hall to remember the
bold maneuver that turned the tide of the 1950-53 Korean War. As
100 relatives and active-duty U.S. soldiers watched, a military
honor guard and brass band welcomed the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony began by remembering the six ''Sitting Duck''
destroyers that sailed up Flying Fish Channel to approach Wolmi-do,
an island that commanded entry to Inchon.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission was to find out -- the hard way -- what North Korean
troops had on the island. They anchored within range of concealed
North Korean guns, making themselves tempting targets.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the shore lit up with gun flashes. The destroyers fought
back in a slugging match that lasted an hour, and returned the next
day. The ships only suffered one death and eight sailors injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''By D-Day the fortifications were reduced so that our Marines
could land and do their great job with minimal casualties,'' said
Schelling, who commanded Lyman K. Swenson, one of the six
destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   The destroyers also led the Sept. 15, 1950, landings, which put
13,000 Marines ashore with only 21 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-foot tides, hidden guns and seawalls, and the danger of
landing in an exposed harbor made the operation seem suicidal. But
it also meant the invasion was a complete surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul, 25 miles inland, fell to allied forces within 12 days,
breaking the back of North Koreans sweeping down South Korea in the
war's early weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of this so-called
'Forgotten War,' no Korean can and no American should ever forget
what you did here,'' said Rear Adm. William. D. Sullivan, commander
of the U.S. Naval Forces in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Inchon has been commemorating the landings by
building the memorial hall and a 20-foot statue of Gen. Douglas
MacArthur, the mastermind of the landings.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea scaled down the war's 50th anniversary events in
order not to hurt thawing relations with communist North Korea
following their summit in June. But U.S. officers and veterans said
Seoul should maintain its wariness toward North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The summit ''would not have been possible without the hammer of
a capable and determined U.S. and (South Korea) military providing
a deterrent to war and ready to fight and win tonight if
necessary,'' Sullivan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chips drifted lower and technology stocks
moved higher for a second consecutive session Thursday after the
government reported an unexpected drop in wholesale prices during
August.
</P>
<P>
   The news reaffirmed assessments that the economy is slowing and
that the Federal Reserve won't need to raise interest rates in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.28 to 11,128.90 in late
morning trading. The Nasdaq composite index was up 81.01 at
3,974.90, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 5.33 to
1,490.24.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street got a lift from the Labor Department's report that
wholesale prices fell an unexpected 0.2 percent last month, the
first drop in four months. The decline followed a flat reading in
the Producer Price Index in July.
</P>
<P>
   The report was further evidence that the economy is slowing and
reassured investors that the inflation-wary Fed is unlikely to
raise rates for a seventh time since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some good data today for the soft-landing scenario, but
obviously there is still not enough confidence overall to get
things totally on track,'' said Ronald J. Hill, an investment
strategist and partner at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. ''But the
course of prices is more likely in our opinion going to go up than
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks led the market higher Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle traded up $3.50 at $85.31 after a Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter analyst upgraded the stock to ''strong buy'' from
''outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose $1.38 to $62.63, gaining back some of the ground it
lost after an investment firm ratings downgrade on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems was up $1.75 at $63.06. And Conexant Systems rose
$12.88 to $49.94, nearly a 35-percent increase, after the company
announced late Wednesday that it was spinning its Internet
infrastructure business off into a separate company.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq is playing a little catch up because they had a
serious setback of underperfomance as we got into September,'' said
Hill, the Brown Brothers Harriman analyst. ''The Dow got a big
boost because of J.P. Morgan speculation. Now that the deal is
known, there's less of a single driver that's pushing the Dow.''
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan Bank announced Wednesday they
were merging. Morgan's shares had been inching upwards on
speculation a deal was in the works, but the announcement sent both
companies stocks down by the end of trading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That trend continued Thursday with Morgan sliding 63 cents to
$180.63 and Chase Manhattan falling 63 cents to $50.56.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 333.69 million
shares, compared to 345.09 million on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 4.55 to 538.55.

<HEADLINE> Danish Detain 37 for Child Porn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Police detained 37 men in pre-dawn
raids Thursday across Denmark, seizing child pornography material
that was distributed by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   No charges were filed, investigators said. Those arrested would
first be fined for distributing the material. Charges could be
considered if it were determined that any were producing or
commercially distributing the photos.
</P>
<P>
   In Denmark, possession of pornography involving those under age
15 is punishable only by fines. The maximum sentence for producing
or commercial distributing of such photos is two years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Ole Hoeyer Pedersen, a police spokesman, said the men likely
didn't know each other, but had exchanged e-mail addresses through
Internet chat rooms and later sent photos to each other
electronically.

Researchers say North America's Jewish population could drop by a
third
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If present trends continue, by the year 2080
North America's Jewish population will drop by a third, to 4
million, according to projections in the new ''American Jewish Year
Book.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual also estimates that by mid-century Israel will have a
majority of the world's Jews, due to its higher birth rate, younger
average age, stronger Jewish identity and lower intermarriage rate
compared with Jewish communities elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   By 2020 Jews in Israel may outnumber those in North America and
by 2080, 10.6 million of the world's 15.6 million Jews may be
Israelis, the article says.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers reporting population trends are Sergio
DellaPergola, Uzi Rebhun and Mark Tolts, all demographers at
Jerusalem's Hebrew University.
</P>
<P>
   Such numbers are inevitably rough estimates subject to
unpredictable factors, they note, but the overall picture of
Israel's rise and a decline elsewhere appears permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The article says that with this shift, Israel will assume the
chief role in world Jewish education and cultural continuity.
</P>
<P>
   North America, long the major funder of the world Jewish
community, may focus more on internal problems and be less able to
help others, the authors warn, and declines could endanger Jewish
organizations in some countries.
</P>
<P>
   The annual, published by the American Jewish Committee, reports
there are currently 5.7 million Jews in the United States, 362,000
in Canada, and 13,191,500 worldwide.

Federal appeals court refuses to block Virginia's minute of silence
law
</P>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Public school students across Virginia are
observing a mandatory minute of silence each day, after a panel of
the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 not to block a new
state law. A few students are protesting by walking out of class
during the daily observance.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which took effect July 1, requires all school districts
to hold a minute of silence for students to meditate, pray or
engage in any other silent activity. A previous law from 24 years
ago gave schools the option of holding a minute of silence and
listed prayer as an option.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a lower federal judge heard arguments on a legal
challenge from the state unit of the American Civil Liberties
Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the hearing, ACLU attorney Stuart Newburger said ''once the
state put the word 'pray' or 'prayer' in the statute, that's enough
to show the state was favoring prayer as a practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General William Hurd argued that Virginia's law has a
secular purpose, ensuring that there is no discrimination against
prayer, and only listed prayer so students know it is one option
among many.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prayer is not a dirty word. It's a fact of life. There's no
reason to be squeamish about it,'' he said.
U.S. church leaders say Clinton ignoring Christians on Jerusalem
issue
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fifteen top U.S. Roman Catholic, Protestant
and Orthodox church leaders have sent President Clinton a joint
letter complaining that the administration has ignored Christians'
concerns about the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also urged the United States not to move its embassy
to Jerusalem while the city's status remains in dispute, and
declared it is ''totally unacceptable'' that West Bank Palestinians
need Israeli permits to enter Jerusalem for worship.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. church leaders, whose groups represent more than 100
million members, said Jerusalem Christians' proposal for a special
city government status under international guarantees would ''allow
Jerusalem to be an open city which transcends local, regional or
world political troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Those signing the appeal included Bishop Joseph Fiorenza,
president of the American Catholic hierarchy; Andrew Young,
president of the National Council of Churches; and the heads of the
Antiochian Orthodox archdiocese, Christian Church (Disciples of
Christ), Episcopal Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,
Presbyterian Church (USA), United Church of Christ and the United
Methodist Church's Council of Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   No Evangelical Protestant leaders were among the signers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 a similar alliance of U.S. religious leaders urged the
Clinton administration to grant Christians, as well as Jews and
Muslims, a role in determining the Holy City's future.
Mormons transforming the biggest U.S. private junior college
</P>
<P>
   REXBURG, Idaho (AP) -- Ricks College students aren't yet
attending ''Brigham Young University-Idaho'' this fall, but
officials are busy planning the transition to a four-year school.
</P>
<P>
   President Gordon B. Hinckley of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, which runs Ricks, announced June 21 that the
nation's biggest private junior college would be transformed into a
four-year campus of the church's university.
</P>
<P>
   The staff has been assessing all resources and preparing for
reaccreditation. Officials say the transition will be phased in
over several years and that the school will avoid duplicating
programs available elsewhere in the region, or at Brigham Young's
other campuses.

Program launched to fight prejudice between Catholics and Jews
</P>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- In a program to counteract prejudice, Colorado
Jewish and Roman Catholic students are learning about each other's
beliefs this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-week course, budgeted at $75,000, is the first such in
the country, said Anita Fricklas, executive director of the
American Jewish Committee's Denver office.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-grade students in synagogues and Catholic day schools
will learn about both Jewish and Catholic holidays, rituals and
symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Also, five high school juniors from each faith have been chosen
to study each religion's beliefs and how to overcome stereotyping.
They will make a two-week field trip to Vatican City and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kids will be pioneers'' in interfaith understanding,
said Bill Beckman, ecumenical officer for Denver's Catholic
archdiocese. ''It's a mine that they will be able to draw from
their entire lives.''
Salvation Army to modernize marriage rules for officers
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The Salvation Army has decided to let regional
units throughout the world decide whether to loosen marriage rules
for officers, including a 135-year-old ban on marrying persons
outside the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Also becoming optional are requirements that officers' marriages
get prior approval from headquarters, that an officer may not marry
anyone more than 17 years older or younger, and that an officer
must leave the organization if the spouse resigns or is fired.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, intended to boost officer recruitment, were
approved by Gen. John Gowans, who became new international leader
in July.
</P>
<P>
   The religious denomination, well known for charitable work, has
more than 1 million members and operates in 107 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the Salvation Army's world territories will decide
whether to adopt the changes, said a spokesman.

Crucifixion relic featured as Greek clerics launch petition drive
on ID cards
</P>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A relic believed by some devout Greek
Orthodox to be from the actual cross on which Jesus Christ was
crucified is coming to Greece as part of a church campaign to
retain a religious designation on state identity cards.
</P>
<P>
   The wood fragment, preserved by Orthodox clergy in Jerusalem,
was scheduled for display at Athens Cathedral as the church
launched a nationwide petition drive to force a referendum on
identity card changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The precious relic of our faith ... is coming at an important
moment,'' said the church's head, Archbishop Christodoulos.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist regime ridiculed the symbolic use of the relic.
Government spokesman Tilemahos Hitiris said the display was
''unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The government says the change in mandatory ID cards, due later
this year, is required to meet European Union civil rights
standards and will not be reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church contends the nation's religious and ethnic
character is at stake. More than 97 percent of the native-born
population is baptized into the Greek church and Orthodox
Christianity is the official religion.
</P>
<P>
   Greece's minority Roman Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Muslims
say the change would curb religious discrimination.
Episcopal leader in good condition after surgery
</P>

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Doctors are fully satisfied after prostate
surgery on the leader of the Episcopal Church, Presiding Bishop
Frank T. Griswold, the denomination's headquarters announced.
</P>
<P>
   Griswold's wife Phoebe was quoted as saying he is ''in good
spirits, sitting up and reading'' following Monday's surgery.

<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) -- The elderly woman sinks slowly onto a
seat next to a brass plaque bearing the name of her deceased
husband. With a faraway look in her eyes, she scans the rows and
rows of wooden benches in the vast synagogue, where hundreds of
nameplates memorialize the Jewish community that once thrived in
this Mediterranean city.
</P>
<P>
   Lina Mattatia, in her mid-70s, is one of fewer than 50 Jews
remaining in Alexandria, where they were once a 50,000-strong
community with businesses, synagogues, a school and friendly
relations with their Muslim neighbors. Some left after the creation
of Israel in 1948, others were expelled during the 1956 Suez crisis
and nationalization programs of the 1950s and 1960s and many of
those remaining fled in the hostile climate of the 1967 Mideast
War.
</P>
<P>
   Other Jews are scattered in Egypt, with the other significant
community a group in Cairo of about the same numbers as
Alexandria's.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who chose to stay are now in their 70s and 80s.
Their school is closed. Their one remaining synagogue sits empty
most of the year because they no longer have enough men to hold
regular services -- 10 are needed for a prayer group, but this
community has only four or five. They do not have access to kosher
food. The grounds of the Eliyahu Hanavi synagogue are heavily
guarded by armed soldiers, and visitors are subjected to exacting
searches of bags and pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Jews here say they are at home in this city of 4
million people, mostly Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not difficult to keep our traditions,'' Mattatia said.
''We don't feel anything against us. The neighbors are very nice.
We have friends. We do our own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Alexandria native admitted: ''If I had children, I would
go with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Meir Balassiano, 61, is the father of Alexandria's only
Jewish family with children. The youngest of his three children, a
son, is 17 and studying in Israel; his two daughters, 19 and 21,
work here.
</P>
<P>
   ''When everyone was leaving and I got married, others begged me
to stay here to start my family. My brothers and uncles left, but I
stayed behind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Balassiano is glad he stayed in his country, but acknowledged he
plans to move to Israel within the next few years, mostly for his
children, who he believes would be denied opportunities in Egypt
because they are Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I could find a job if I didn't work at the
synagogue,'' he said. ''My son will not be able to find a job or a
wife here. We must leave.''
</P>
<P>
   After decades of tension and four wars, Egypt and Israel signed
a peace treaty in 1979, but relations are far from normal. Egyptian
professional groups ban their members from contacts with the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
   But ''Muslims are very tolerant of us,'' said Meir Mishan, the
Israeli consul-general in Alexandria. ''We have no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   So why the tight security around Jewish buildings?
</P>
<P>
   ''We just have to be careful,'' Mishan said.
</P>
<P>
   Jews have lived in Alexandria since soon after the city's
founding in 331 B.C. Encouraged by Alexander the Great, they came
in great numbers, at one point making up at least one-fourth of the
city's population. The city faltered over the centuries, but was
rebuilt in the 1800s, and the Jews returned, adding their active
community to the large foreign population.
</P>
<P>
   The 150-year-old Eliyahu Hanavi Sephardic synagogue offers a
glimpse of what the Jewish community was like in its prime. The
magnificent building, one of the largest synagogues in the Middle
East, boasts towering Italian marble columns and seating for over
700 people. The brass nameplates marked the regular seats of its
male patrons, with extra seating upstairs for the women. A closed
chamber at the front of the building holds about 30 Torah scrolls,
collected from the city's other synagogues when they closed.
</P>
<P>
   Now the synagogue sits empty, sometimes visited by a member
lighting candles of remembrance, rarely entered by a tourist
wandering past on the busy street. Twice a year, on the Jewish
holidays of Passover and Rosh Hashanah, a small delegation travels
from Israel to provide the necessary male contingent for religious
services and to deliver kosher food.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Alexandria's Jewish Community, Joe Harari, 85,
said he has bid goodbye too many times over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too many people left for other countries,'' he said. ''I am
Jewish, but I am also Egyptian. I'm 100 percent satisfied and happy
here. Why would I leave?''
</P>
<P>
   Harari is typical of his dwindling community. Strong-willed
enough to stay in Egypt even after the exodus of relatives and
friends, the few remaining Jews live out their years wrapped in
their community, subsisting mainly on the rental income of the
school and other small buildings on the synagogue's property to
businesses and some residents.
</P>
<P>
   In the empty courtyard, Balassiano looks up at the four-story
school where he was once a student and a teacher, remembering when
the classrooms were full of children studying Hebrew and the
courtyard rang with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sad that everyone has gone, but what can I do?'' he
asked. ''It's a memory for me, a souvenir.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 54; Nasdaq Rises 78  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chips drifted lower and technology stocks
moved higher for a second consecutive session Thursday after the
government reported an unexpected drop in wholesale prices during
August.
</P>
<P>
   The news reaffirmed assessments that the economy is slowing and
that the Federal Reserve won't need to raise interest rates in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54.02 to 11,128.16 in
midday trading. The Nasdaq composite index was up 77.71 at
3,971.60, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 3.71to 1,488.62.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street got a lift from the Labor Department's report that
wholesale prices fell an unexpected 0.2 percent last month, the
first drop in four months. The decline followed a flat reading in
the Producer Price Index in July.
</P>
<P>
   The report was further evidence that the economy is slowing and
reassured investors that the inflation-wary Fed is unlikely to
raise rates for a seventh time since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some good data today for the soft-landing scenario, but
obviously there is still not enough confidence overall to get
things totally on track,'' said Ronald J. Hill, an investment
strategist and partner at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. ''But the
course of prices is more likely, in our opinion, going to go up
than down.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks led the market higher Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle traded up $3.06 at $84.88 after a Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter analyst upgraded the stock to ''strong buy'' from
''outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 81 cents to $62.06, gaining back some of the ground
it lost after an investment firm ratings downgrade on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems was up $1.63 at $62.94. And Conexant Systems rose
$13.44 to $50.50, a 36-percent increase, after the company
announced late Wednesday that it was spinning its Internet
infrastructure business off into a separate company.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq is playing a little catch up because they had a
serious setback of underperfomance as we got into September,'' said
Hill, the Brown Brothers Harriman analyst. ''The Dow got a big
boost because of J.P. Morgan speculation. Now that the deal is
known, there's less of a single driver that's pushing the Dow.''
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan Bank announced Wednesday they
were merging. Morgan's shares had been inching upwards on
speculation a deal was in the works, but the announcement sent both
companies stocks down by the end of trading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That trend continued Thursday with Morgan sliding $1.81 on
profit-taking to $179.44 and Chase Manhattan falling $1 to $50.19.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-food company McDonald's was also down, declining $1.19 to
$26.81, after it warned late Wednesday that currency woes in Europe
would cut into its third-quarter earnings. Several analysts lowered
their earnings estimates for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 474.61 million
shares, compared to 487.99 million on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 4.83 to 538.83.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes International Relief  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday the United
States has a moral responsibility to help well-meaning poor nations
get out from under crushing debt, and asked religious leaders to
help him lobby Congress for more money.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want people to organize themselves well, run themselves
well, and build a future, we've got to do this,'' Clinton said at
his annual White House breakfast gathering for leaders from all
faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton listed Latin American and African countries where he
said responsible governments are making good-faith efforts to
improve lives but face a debt burden largely incurred by previous,
corrupt regimes.
</P>
<P>
   The debt payments rob those countries of capital that could be
invested in education, health care and other improvements, Clinton
said, echoing an argument made by leaders of many poor nations
along with Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is a moral issue,'' Clinton said. ''How can we sit
here on the biggest mountain of wealth we have ever accumulated,
that any nation in all of human history has ever accumulated, and
not'' share that wealth? he continued.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not just throwing money away. We're only giving this
money to people who not only promise to, but prove they are able
to, take all the savings and invest it in the human needs of their
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress largely approved Clinton's request for money to forgive
some debts directly owed to the United States. Congress balked at
underwriting loans funded by several countries through the
International Monetary Fund or other international lenders.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Uganda became the first poor country to qualify for
millions of dollars in debt relief under a program called the
''highly indebted poor countries'' initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and leaders of other rich nations support the debt
relief program for 40 of the world's poorest nations while critics
say the program is slow and doesn't provide enough relief.
</P>
<P>
   Rich nations' response to international debt was a theme of
protests during last year's World Trade Organization meeting in
Seattle, and at this year's International Monetary Fund and World
Bank gathering in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted such dissent and said he ''doesn't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that it is very much in the interest of America to
have big, large-scale debt relief,'' Clinton said, ''if the
countries that get the relief are committed to, and held
accountable to, good governance and using the money not to build up
military power, but to invest in the human needs of their people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, Clinton has used the religious leaders'
forum to apologize for his conduct in the Monica Lewinsky scandal,
to which he apparently made an oblique reference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He greeted the crowd on behalf of his wife, New York Senate
candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, ''who called me early this
morning to ask what I was going to say.'' He also sent tidings from
Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee for president, and
Gore's wife, Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you know, the three of them are otherwise occupied, but
they need your prayers maybe even more than I do,'' Clinton said to
laughter.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Festival Shows Role-Reversal  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- There's a cliche about actors, that what they
really want to do is direct. But there's little in the way of
cliches about the films directed by noted actors playing at the
Toronto International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup for the festival that ends Saturday includes films
directed by Al Pacino, Liv Ullmann, Sally Field and Ed Harris. Each
deals with the tribulations of art and performance, from Harris'
sober biography ''Pollock,'' about abstract painter Jackson
Pollock, to Field's lighter look at an obsessive beauty queen
wannabe (Minnie Driver) in ''Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Many actors have moved into directing successful films, notably
Clint Eastwood, whose ''Space Cowboys'' opened last month, and
Robert Redford, whose golfing fable ''The Legend of Bagger Vance''
debuts this fall. Robert Duvall's self-financed ''The Apostle''
screened at the Toronto festival in 1997 and came away with a $5
million distribution deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''For some actors I know, in a sense directing is kind of a
natural outgrowth,'' Harris said. ''You act in film after film over
the years, and ultimately, you realize it would be nice to be in
control of your own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Ullmann, veteran of such Ingmar Bergman films as ''Persona'' and
''Scenes from a Marriage,'' directed ''Faithless,'' a harrowing
account of infidelity based on a script by Bergman. The movie
unfolds through flashbacks as an aging writer works on a script
about a tragic love affair.
</P>
<P>
   Pacino's movie ''Chinese Coffee,'' based on a play Pacino
starred in six years ago, recounts the uneasy friendship of a
failed writer desperate for affirmation from a mentor (Jerry
Orbach).
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Pacino both star in their own films, while Field and
Ullmann stayed behind the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Field, making her feature-film directing debut after previously
directing the TV movie ''The Christmas Tree'' and an episode of
''From the Earth to the Moon,'' said she might act in something she
directs in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not now, though,'' Field said. ''It's too difficult a task,
this directing task. I don't know if somewhere down the line I
might feel more comfortable with directing and figure out how to do
it, but right now I can't imagine it. I can't imagine how the
actors who have done it are capable of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who had not directed before, originally planned only to
star in ''Pollock,'' a project he has tried to get on film for
nearly 10 years. About a year before shooting started, Harris
decided to direct it, saying he had such personal attachment to the
film and a sense for how he wanted it made.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big reason was I realized that I didn't want to share
whatever vision I had. I would be hard pressed to say what that
vision was at the time, but I knew I had my own thoughts about
it,'' Harris said. ''I needed to find out and have the freedom to
explore that on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Faithless'' is the fourth film directed by Ullmann and her
second based on a Bergman script. Ullmann said she has given up
acting altogether, partly because good roles for older women are
scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not that many good directors, nor scripts, and the few
that are don't necessarily come my way,'' Ullmann said. ''That has
to do with age. They make very little interesting for older women,
and I don't want to be pathetic and do pathetic things, because
I've had such a wonderful life in acting.''
</P>
<P>
   When she started directing in the early 1990s, Ullmann said,
''The first week, I thought, 'Oh, my God, I know this is what I can
do.' This gives me so much more pleasure. To make the frame and
have all the best talent in the world filming with me. It gives me
as much pleasure to give the actors the trust and the framework,
the scenery, whatever they want, and see that blossom.''
</P>
<P>
   For Pacino, directing is a matter of discovering small projects
outside the big-budget studio system, films where he feels he has
some personal statement to make. Such films fit his directing
skills, which he describes as modest, movies that are cinematic
equivalents to off-off-Broadway productions, Pacino said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have had the opportunity and luck to work with some
masters,'' said Pacino, who previously directed the documentary
''Looking for Richard,'' a contemporary examination of
Shakespeare's ''Richard III.'' ''I just don't feel near that or in
their league at all. ... I feel like a novice. I don't feel it's my
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   What he has discovered about his directing skills, Pacino joked,
is ''that I should stay away from it.''

<HEADLINE> Germany Bans Skinhead Group  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Pushing a crackdown on violent neo-Nazis, Germany
banned the German division of an international skinhead group
called ''Blood and Honor'' on Thursday, saying it spread Nazism
through racist music, magazines and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Otto Schily said the white supremacist
organization, founded in Britain in the mid-1980s and active
worldwide, has attracted about 200 German members and another 100
in its youth wing, called ''White Youth,'' since establishing its
first branch in Berlin in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Police searched at least 30 sites linked to the group Thursday
morning, confiscating propaganda material and bank books listing
deposits ''in five figures,'' Schily said. A computer was seized in
one raid in Hesse state, officials there said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence directly implicating ''Blood and Honor'' in
attacks on foreigners or other targets here. But Schily said the
skinhead concerts it organizes, the fanzines for neo-Nazi bands it
publishes and other activities ''poison the heads and hearts'' of
young people and promote a dangerous mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's enough that they adopted the goal of spreading Nazi
ideology,'' he said in justifying the ban. ''Such things create a
certain atmosphere or disposition that then makes them more prone
to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous times, he said, youths arrested after neo-Nazi attacks
told police they were inspired by listening to rock bands such as
''Die Haerte'' (''The Hardness''), who sing about such things as
torching foreigners' homes. ''Blood and Honor'' organized concerts
featuring such bands, including one last fall in Garitz, 75 miles
southwest of Berlin, that drew about 2,000 skinheads.
</P>
<P>
   Music with lyrics glorifying Nazism or inciting racial hatred
are banned in Germany. Sites for the concerts are usually reserved
for ''birthday parties'' or some other innocuous event. Police
break up the gatherings once they get wind of them.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is the first country to ban ''Blood and Honor,'' whose
members often have the name tattooed on their shaved head or body.
A ban of another skinhead club, the U.S.-based ''Hammerskins,'' is
also under consideration, Schily said.
</P>
<P>
   The groups are active across Europe as well as in North America,
Australia and South Africa, he said.

<HEADLINE> Floods, Storms Batter Southeast Asia  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Unprecedented floods have killed nearly
100 people across Southeast Asia -- including a teen-age boy who
drowned Thursday in front of the royal palace in Cambodia as
hundreds watched from the riverbank.
</P>
<P>
   The floods have forced 600,000 people from their homes in
Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. Rescue workers were distributing
drinking water Thursday, and naval boats evacuated people stranded
by high water.
</P>
<P>
   At least 89 people have died in Cambodia and eight in Vietnam
since the floods began in July, officials said. Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen said the level of the Mekong River, one of three
that meet in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, is higher than any
time in the past 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nou Vibol, 14, was playing with an inner tube with two cousins
in the Tonle Sap River in front of the royal palace in Phnom Penh
when he was flipped out by the turbulent waters as hundreds of
people watched from the bank, said a cousin, Nou Chan Pisit.
</P>
<P>
   ''He tried to grab me because he could not swim. I was trying to
grab his hand but had no luck,'' the cousin said, weeping. ''There
were many adults around, but they did not help.''
</P>
<P>
   State television in Vietnam showed thousands of houses flooded
in Dong Thap and Long An provinces bordering Cambodia after the
Mekong overflowed there, turning vast areas of surrounding rice
fields into huge lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers, sailors and other rescuers used boats to pick up
stranded villagers from houses built on stilts.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen, touring a district about 25 miles from Phnom Penh,
warned merchants against profiteering from the floods, saying many
businesses have increased the prices of rice and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have participated to stop the killing fields, the genocide
of Pol Pot ... but it is impossible for me to stop the natural
disaster,'' the Cambodian leader told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   About 600,000 people have lost their homes and farmland to the
floods engulfing the region, the International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millions of people have been affected by this year's unusually
widespread monsoon floods,'' it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The water level at the meeting point of Mekong, Tonle Sap and
the Bassac rivers in Phnom Penh is expected to reach 37 feet on
Friday. Officials say Phnom Penh's streets could be flooded if the
level reaches 38 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Seija Tyrninoksa, the Cambodia director of the Red Cross and Red
Crescent federation, said 500,000 people need emergency assistance
such as clothes, food, plastic sheets and blankets. Another 100,000
people required similar aid in Vietnam, the federation said.
</P>
<P>
   The aid agency appealed for $1.13 million in international aid,
with $904,000 needed for Cambodia alone.
</P>
<P>
   The United States announced a donation of $25,000 on Thursday,
the U.S. Embassy said.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain began in the region in July, 45 days ahead of the
normal monsoon. The rainfall continued, swelling the Mekong, which
flows from Cambodia to Vietnam to form the Mekong Delta.
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam's Dong Thap province, more than 110,000 homes have
been flooded, said Dang Ngoc Loi, a local official.
</P>
<P>
   He said more than 30 rescue teams are distributing food,
noodles, drinking water, clothes and mosquito nets to more than
4,000 families.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the widespread rains, only 2 percent of Vietnam's rice
crops were destroyed because of an early harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually widespread monsoon floods also affected major
rice-producing areas of central and southern Laos where at least
four provinces have been badly affected and face food shortages.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Crisis Eases in Britain  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Britain's fuel crisis eased Thursday as several
blockades ended at refineries and depots, but other protests
continued -- and one abruptly restarted after demonstrators learned
that an oil company had raised its prices.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters won that round, as Esso quickly rescinded the
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not all the protests are over. There's some way to go,'' Prime
Minister Tony Blair said. ''It will be days before regular supplies
get back to normal, even if the protests finish today.''
</P>
<P>
   As some protesters declared a moral victory and went home,
others refused to budge. Some returned to the scenes of abandoned
blockades, hoping to stop the tankers again.
</P>
<P>
   Military tankers were pressed into service to help relieve the
backlog, but at best, industry officials said it will take weeks to
get supplies fully back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Europe, the protests continued. In Belgium,
truckers blocked streets to protest high fuel prices, truckers and
farmers in Spain planned new demonstrations, and leaders in Poland
and Hungary pleaded for public restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt demanded that protesters
end their obstruction in exchange for a government compensation
package worth $85 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government will not tolerate that a minority of truckers
exposes our country, our people, our economy and our industry to
further damage,'' Verhofstadt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He calls us a minority, but we've brought the whole of Belgium
to a standstill. He's treating us like clowns,'' retorted Serge
Adriaens, president of the UPTR union.
</P>
<P>
   Blair promised to listen to protesters, but offered no
concessions on the taxes that have made British fuel prices the
highest in Europe. British truckers paid an average $4.33 a gallon
for diesel last month, compared to $2.63 in Belgium, according to
the Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''However much people may dislike paying petrol duty, there's no
way that any government of this country could or should yield to
this form of protest,'' Blair told his third nationally televised
news conference in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting claims of a sales tax windfall because of rising world
oil prices, Blair said the extra revenue would not be enough to cut
fuel taxes by even a cent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, public opinion polls suggest many Britons blame Blair for
the protests. A poll commissioned by the BBC and taken on Tuesday
suggested that nearly 80 percent of those surveyed supported the
demonstrators and 90 percent wanted cuts in the fuel tax.
</P>
<P>
   The first protest to end in Britain was at Stanlow in
northwestern England, where the loosely organized coalition of
truckers and farmers began the campaign a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have backed down,'' said Brynle Williams, spokesman for
protesters at the Stanlow refinery in northwest England. ''We have
won a moral victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickets quickly left nearly a dozen other sites.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public opinion would have gone against us had we continued,''
said Robert Burns, spokesman for protesters at the Grangemouth
refinery near Edinburgh, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The men blocking the Coryton Oil Refinery northeast of London
had voted to stop, but changed their minds after learning of Esso's
decision to raise prices. Esso, facing criticism from Blair and
others, backed down within hours. ''We recognize that the timing is
regrettable,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel crisis sparked a rash of panic buying, and some stores
ran out of milk and bread. The Royal Mail said Thursday it was
suspending Sunday collections, to conserve fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In Yorkshire, the Malton Bacon Factory said it would have to
stop slaughtering pigs, while Webb Country Foods in southeastern
England said 6 million chicks might starve by Friday unless feed
deliveries resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Holloway, director of the Petrol Retailers Association, said
the deficit in supplies is equal to four days of normal deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to take us two to three weeks to get back to normal
levels. That assumes we can make more than the usual 3,000
deliveries a day, and that's a massive logistical problem,''
Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel price protests have swept Europe since French drivers took
to the streets and won tax concessions from their government
earlier in the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarian oil and gas company, MOL, will raise wholesale
gasoline prices by 2.7 percent and diesel prices by 5.4 percent
Friday, and the Association of Hungarian Truckers announced it
would protest the hikes and ''not shirk from radical means.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We can see how in Western Europe these blockades lead
nowhere,'' Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Spanish Farmers and Ranchers called Thursday
for demonstrations next week to protest higher fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Polish Interior Minister Marek Biernacki warned of tough action
against truckers if they participate in a go-slow protest Friday on
the nation's highways.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of International Haulers in Poland called for
the protest to press for some relief on fuel costs. The state fuel
monopoly PKN Orlen announced a small cuts in gasoline and diesel
prices Thursday in line with recent drops in world oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Activist Claims Innocence  </HEADLINE>
By DRAGAN ILIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIS, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An imprisoned ethnic Albanian activist --
by turns poet, pediatrician and women's rights champion -- appeared
in a Yugoslav court Thursday, said she was innocent and demanded to
see documents about her case.
</P>
<P>
   Flora Brovina, 50, whose case has become a rallying cry to free
all Albanian prisoners from Serb jails, was sentenced in December
to 12 years in prison on terrorism charges and alleged links to the
rebels of the disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented move in June, Yugoslavia's Supreme Court
overturned the conviction and referred the case back to the court
in the southern city of Nis -- a development, Brovina says
authorities never told her of.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a judge Thursday, Brovina -- looking calm and composed but
tired -- told a packed courtroom that she had found out from
newspapers of the supreme court's decision and demanded it be
handed to her and her defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am innocent and I would like to see the supreme court's
statement with my own eyes,'' Brovina said.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding judge Marina Milanovic ruled that the new trial would
begin Oct. 12 and ordered Brovina back to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Natasa Kandic of the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Center
rushed past police guards to embrace Brovina before the Albanian
activist was taken back to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expected Brovina to be a free woman today,'' Kandic said.
''This all is an unnecessary delay because the charges are
senseless and preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Brovina's three attorneys, Zivojin Jokanovic, said his
client was mistreated and ''deprived of her rights in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   She ''was even denied pen and paper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brovina was arrested by Serb forces during NATO's 78-day air
bombardment of Yugoslavia. NATO resorted to the bombing to end a
Serbian army crackdown in the largely ethnic Albanian province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Brovina and hundreds of other Kosovo Albanians were transferred
to prisons in Serbia proper after Yugoslav forces moved out and
NATO-led peacekeepers took control of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, now run by NATO and a U.N. peace mission, remains
officially part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   By last July, the international Red Cross registered 1,922
ethnic Albanian detainees throughout Serbia. About half of them
have since been released.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Link to Jakarta Bombing Eyed  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Protesters threw rocks and gasoline
bombs Thursday after ex-dictator Suharto failed to show up at his
corruption trial for a second time and a court ordered new medical
tests to verify defense claims that he is seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, speculation mounted that supporters of the former
president in the military might have planted a car bomb that killed
15 people on Wednesday at the Jakarta Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The blast was the deadliest in a series of unexplained bombings
that have coincided with major developments in the case against
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Juwono Sudarso, a former defense minister, said Suharto
loyalists in the military may have launched a terrorist campaign in
order to block the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may be implicated if Suharto talks in court. And they are
the ones who are the least interested in having the trial start,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid, whose grip on power has been
weakened by months of violence across the sprawling Southeast Asian
nation, demanded that police arrest suspects, regardless of their
position.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no sacred cows in this country,'' Wahid said,
according to Cabinet Secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they were tightening security around the head of
state, who has warned of a conspiracy to cripple his year-old
government, Indonesia's most democratic in more than four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said police conducting
inquires into the bombings ''have had difficulty in investigating
the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Wednesday's bomb was triggered by the same
military-type explosive used in another recent car bombing at the
Philippine ambassador's residence. The latest blast set off a
massive fire in the underground parking lot of the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of anti-Suharto demonstrators clashed with police and a
smaller group of supporters of the ex-dictator after he failed to
attend his trial for the second time in two weeks. Officers fired
warning shots and tear gas grenades near the former leader's home.
</P>
<P>
   During the session, Suharto's private doctors told the court
that the 79-year-old ex-president, who has suffered three strokes,
might die if subjected to the rigors of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Using overhead projections they displayed scans of his brain,
which they said had been damaged by the strokes, leaving him frail
and confused. He also suffers from hypertension, kidney stones,
heart problems and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The next threat to his health, which could include any
stressful event, will worsen other previous ailments,'' said Teguh
Ranahkusuma, Suharto's top physician. ''The next threat will be
fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   State doctors disagreed and presiding judge Lalu Mariyun
appointed a team of doctors from three universities as well as
Indonesia's medical association and Health Ministry to examine
Suharto and report its findings on Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   He also ordered Suharto to attend that hearing, which will be
the third since the trial started on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto ruled Indonesia for 32 years until violent
demonstrations forced him to quit in 1998. He is charged with
skimming off $583 million in state money to bankroll the business
empires of his family and cronies. He has denied any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Russian Head Fears Foreign Media  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- In language reminiscent of Soviet times, a policy
document signed by President Vladimir Putin warns of ''information
weapons'' allegedly used against Russia by foreign powers and calls
for tighter controls over media.
</P>
<P>
   The document, called the Information Security Doctrine of the
Russian Federation, immediately came under criticism from
journalists and media rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin is being driven by his KGB instincts,'' Ruslan Gorevoi,
an activist with the Glasnost Defense Foundation, said in reference
to Putin's 16-year career in the Soviet secret police. ''Now he
wants to apply his KGB colonel's skills to the president's job.''
</P>
<P>
   The document, signed by Putin on Monday and posted on the
government's Web site, outlines a long list of threats to the
government and public in the sphere of media and information.
Subversive activity by foreigners ranks high.
</P>
<P>
   It accuses unidentified foreign powers of plotting to ''infringe
on Russia's interests in the global information space'' and even
working out concepts of ''information wars'' with the aim of
''hampering the normal operation of the information and
telecommunication systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The document claims that foreign media organizations are trying
to squeeze Russians out of the news market and suggests that their
activities in Russia be checked more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   The document was vaguely worded and doesn't have legal force,
but was regarded by press freedom advocates as a disturbing sign of
the thinking prevalent in the government and its bureaucracies,
whose actions can be more important than legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Gorevoi and others voiced fear that the document may signal the
start of a broad attack on media freedom, involving tighter
licensing and tax rules for the independent media.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin wants to feed people with good news to make them feel
happy -- a new edition of the Soviet information cocoon, which
isolated the nation from the rest of the world,'' Gorevoi said.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the authors of the doctrine, Anatoly Streltsov, told
the Obshchaya Gazeta weekly that the document ''aims at increasing
the efficiency of the state-controlled media and doesn't try to
force the government's will on independent media.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As for the non-government media, we may only offer them
information and wait for their interpretation,'' he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Two high-profile cases this year have raised concerns about
media freedom in Russia. Radio Liberty correspondent Andrei
Babitsky was detained in what was widely seen as retribution for
critical reporting on Chechnya, while media magnate Vladimir
Gusinsky was jailed for several days on corruption charges.
Gusinsky's media empire has criticized the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has said that the information doctrine would help protect
journalists' rights and tackle computer crimes. He has denied
accusations that his government is leading a crackdown on the
media.
</P>
<P>
   But in several public outbursts last month, he accused media
tycoons, who often use their news organizations as weapons in
Russia's political struggles, of trying to discredit and smear the
government.

<HEADLINE> China Executes High-Level Official  </HEADLINE>
By JOE McDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A senior Chinese legislator who took nearly $5
million in bribes in hopes of marrying his mistress was executed
Thursday in a highly publicized case meant to convince an angry
public that communist leaders are stamping out rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng Kejie, vice chairman of China's national legislature,
became the highest-ranking figure put to death for corruption since
the communists came to power in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the execution was announced, portions of the
66-year-old Cheng's trial in July were shown on national
television, adding to a propaganda campaign meant to show official
determination to attack abuses at even the highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng was convicted of extorting $4.9 million while he was the
governor of Guangxi, a poor southern region. Earlier reports said
that beginning in 1992, he took payoffs for land deals, building
contracts, promotions and allocations of subsidized commodities.
</P>
<P>
   The case illustrated the pervasive corruption that is costing
China's struggling economy heavily and undermining public
acceptance of communist rule. A recent series of unusually candid
reports by China's auditor general accuse officials of stealing or
squandering billions of dollars in a country with an average per
capita income of about $700.
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily, Chinese state media announce officials being
punished for corruption, though most are low-ranking. More than
132,000 officials received penalties for misconduct last year that
range up to death sentences, according to the China Daily
newspaper. Cheng's case featured prominently in a Beijing museum
exhibition on economic crime.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng was put to death by the No. 1 Intermediate People's Court
in Beijing after China's highest court rejected his second appeal,
the official Xinhua News Agency said. It quoted the Sept. 7 ruling
by the Supreme People's Court as saying Cheng ''severely damaged
the normal work order of government agencies and created an
extremely pernicious influence on society.''
</P>
<P>
   A commentary in Friday editions of the Communist Party newspaper
People's Daily said his case shows the party ''is completely
capable of eliminating cancers invading into the body of the
party,'' according to Xinhua. It called the case a ''warning to
party members and officials.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the official account, Cheng's partner in crime was
his married lover, Li Ping. Both planned to divorce their spouses
and marry each other. Li has been sentenced to life in prison for
handling Cheng's bribes. The Supreme People's Court, which upheld
her sentence last week, said she did so to keep him free of
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Xinhua didn't say how Cheng was executed. China has usually used
a bullet to the head or neck. Last month, it ordered nationwide use
of lethal injection, but said firing squads still would be used.
</P>
<P>
   China's ruling elite also has been shaken by a scandal that went
to trial this week in closed courtrooms in the southeastern
province of Fujian. An unknown number of police, customs and other
officials have been implicated in a multibillion-dollar smuggling
ring.
</P>
<P>
   Xinhua also carried rare mention Thursday of a bribery
investigation against Vice Minister of Public Security Li Jizhou.
The remarks by Deputy Procurator-General Zhao Dengju were the first
public acknowledgment of Li's fate, 21 months after he was quietly
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases caused friction in Chinese circles of power.
President Jiang Zemin reined in the Fujian investigation after it
tainted one of his proteges.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng's conviction was also seen as a sign of the waning power
of Li Peng, the head of the National People's Congress and No. 2 in
the party hierarchy. In 1998, Li plucked Cheng, a member of the
Zhuang ethnic minority, from the southern Guangxi region, bringing
him to Beijing as a congress vice chairman.

<HEADLINE> War Crimes Meeting Focuses on Latvia  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL TARM
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUMBULA, Latvia (AP) -- The old pine forest is now circled by car
dealerships and littered with abandoned tires and scrap metal, so
most passers-by would hardly recognize it as site of one of the
worst atrocities of the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
   In just two days in 1941, some 25,000 Jews were put to death
here on the outskirts of Latvia's capital Riga, just off a busy
four-lane highway to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting Thursday of prosecutors from seven countries, invited
by Latvia to compare evidence of nearly 60-year-old war crimes, has
focused attention on this killing field.
</P>
<P>
   The main targets of the conference are Konrads Kalejs, 86, and
Karlis Ozols, 87. Both reportedly were officers in the Arajs
Kommando, a Nazi death squad staffed mostly by Latvians and
involved in various massacres, including those at Rumbula. Kalejs
and Ozols now live in Australia and have denied involvement.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1941-1944 Nazi occupation, 90 percent of Latvia's
90,000 Jews perished. The Rumbula massacres stood out in their
gruesome assembly line efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   German SS officers bragged they'd used 25,000 bullets at
Rumbula, a bullet per murder, Latvian-American historian Andrew
Ezergailis, the leading expert on Nazi atrocities in Latvia, wrote
in his book, ''The Holocaust in Latvia.''
</P>
<P>
   Margers Vestermanis, one of few survivors of the Riga ghetto
where Jews were interned, worked as a slave laborer alongside
Soviet war prisoners in mid-November 1941 when they warned him
about pits they'd dug in the sandy soil at Rumbula.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets said the pits were mass graves intended for Jews.
Verstermanis, then a teen-ager and now age 75, didn't believe them.
''No. They're not for us. They're for you!'' he recalled telling
them in response.
</P>
<P>
   That the Soviets were right became clear on Nov. 30, 1941, when
Nazis, including Germans and Latvians, swept into the Jewish
ghetto, roused men, women and children, and forced them onto the
cobblestone streets.
</P>
<P>
   To lull people into cooperating in their own death march, they
were told they were being sent to a new camp and to pack a 44-pound
suitcase, said Vestermanis, the director of Riga's Jewish museum.
</P>
<P>
   Victims, many aware they were doomed, walked through the
ghetto's barbed wire gates to Rumbula, 6 miles away. Stripped
naked, they were beaten and kicked through a gauntlet, one by one,
to the pits. Then each was shot in the back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Vestermanis heard people talking about the
massacres, but he didn't believe them. ''Who could believe you
could kill 12,000 people in one day?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, on Dec. 8, 1941, his father, mother and sister
were marched to Rumbula and slain, while Vestermanis was again
forced to work for the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Latvia recovered independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
Ever since, its leaders have grappled -- not too convincingly, human
rights and Jewish groups claim -- with how to prosecute alleged war
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Latvian prosecutors have been preparing war crimes charges
against Kalejs based on evidence he served as a guard at a Nazi
concentration camp at Salaspils, a few miles from Rumbula.
</P>
<P>
   A purpose of the conference was to scrutinize the strength of
Latvia's evidence against Kalejs and determine if it met
international legal standards. Investigators from the United
States, Canada, Australia, Britain, Germany and Israel attended.
</P>
<P>
   If Kalejs or Ozols were indicted, extradited and put on trial,
it would be the first time an alleged Nazi would face a Latvian
court on genocide charges since the Baltic state regained
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Some Latvians too young to witness or remember what happened
nevertheless are haunted by the accounts they've heard.
</P>
<P>
   Sergejs Bojars, a watchman at a truck depot near the killing
field, says he walks through the site, which is marked by a small
monument, on his way to work every day. His mother described seeing
Jews going by her house near Rumbula, and learning later that they
had been slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Especially at night, I can't help thinking about what happened
there,'' said the 51-year-old Latvian, clutching a guard dog by the
collar. ''I can feel the spirits of the dead.''

<HEADLINE> Canoes Show Life in Neolithic Paris  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Thousands of years before the Bateaux Mouches began
plying the Seine with sightseers, Neolithic Parisians cruised the
river in dugout canoes, fishing and trading with their neighbors
upstream.
</P>
<P>
   Three 6,000-year-old canoes, unveiled Thursday, suggest human
settlements were set up at the location of present-day Paris up to
1,500 years earlier than had been believed.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-foot canoes, each hewn from a single oak log, will be the
centerpiece of a new wing of the Carnavalet Museum scheduled to
open later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The dugouts, the earliest of which experts say dates to 4,500
B.C., were unearthed along with thousands of artifacts by French
archaeologists in 1990 during a major urban renewal project on the
banks of the Seine at Bercy, in southeastern Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''The site is the most spectacular of its kind ever found in
Paris and shows that the city is much older than we had thought,''
said Philippe Velay, archaeology curator at the Carnavalet.
</P>
<P>
   Other Neolithic remains were found under the courtyard of the
Louvre Museum in central Paris when it was undergoing renovations
in the early 1980s, he said. But that find, much smaller than the
Bercy one, was not studied in depth at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the finds suggest two Neolithic communities a few
miles apart that had contact with each other via the Seine, which
at the time was over a mile wide in parts. Experts had previously
put the earliest settlements in the Paris region to around
3,000-2,500 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Neolithic period, characterized by polished stone tools,
pottery and agriculture, ranges from 8,000-3,500 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Bercy site could have had between a few hundred and a
thousand people living in it at one time. Along with a total 11
canoes, archaeologists found some 50,000 objects -- including
perfectly preserved fragments of ceramic bowls and cups, a flint
and a millstone. A double tomb was unearthed containing the
skeletons of two children, aged 9 and 5, curled in the fetal
position.
</P>
<P>
   Also found were a polished ax, wooden bow and a fish hook, as
well as beaver, turtle and wolf remains, Velay said. ''This
suggests that the earliest city dwellers were concerned primarily
with their own survival, and hunted and fished for food,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The canoes -- some large enough to hold six people -- were found
about 26 feet underground, perfectly preserved in the soil. One
boat was split in half inadvertently by a bulldozer working on the
site.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest challenge was figuring out a way to make sure that
their discovery was not the first step towards their
disappearance,'' said archaeologist Philippe Marquis, who made the
discovery in September 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to make sure they didn't just dry out and crumble, and
basically, we just kept them wet using an ordinary lawn
sprinkler,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marquis said that if archaeologists had had the opportunity to
stay and excavate longer, they could have unearthed more of the
settlement. A public park has since been built over the site.
</P>
<P>
   Since their discovery, which was not made public at the time,
the canoes underwent a $280,000 treatment at a laboratory in
Grenoble to stabilize the condition of the wood. They will be
displayed in temperature- and humidity-controlled cases.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 95; Nasdaq Climbs 41  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chips fell sharply Thursday on
profit-taking and concerns about the drop in the euro currency, but
technology stocks moved higher for a second straight session on
speculation about upbeat third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 95.45 to 11,128.16 in
afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index was up
40.81 at 3,934.70, but the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 1.43 to
1,483.48.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, Wall Street got a lift from the Labor
Department's report that wholesale prices fell an unexpected 0.2
percent last month, the first drop in four months. The decline
followed a flat reading in the Producer Price Index in July.
</P>
<P>
   The report was further evidence that the economy is slowing and
reassured investors that the inflation-wary Fed is unlikely to
raise rates for a seventh time since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some good data today for the soft-landing scenario, but
obviously there is still not enough confidence overall to get
things totally on track,'' said Ronald J. Hill, an investment
strategist and partner at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. ''But the
course of prices is more likely, in our opinion, going to go up
than down.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks moved higher, including Conexant Systems,
which rose $14 to $51.06, a nearly 38 percent increase. The company
announced late Wednesday it was spinning its Internet
infrastructure business off into a separate company.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, which was expected to release earnings late Thursday,
traded up $2.25 at $84.06 after a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
analyst upgraded the stock to ''strong buy'' from ''outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems was up 19 cents at $61.50.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq is playing a little catch up because they had a
serious setback of underperfomance as we got into September,'' said
Hill, the Brown Brothers Harriman analyst. ''The Dow got a big
boost because of J.P. Morgan speculation. Now that the deal is
known, there's less of a single driver that's pushing the Dow.''
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan Bank announced Wednesday they
were merging. Morgan's shares had been inching upwards on
speculation a deal was in the works, but the announcement sent both
companies stocks down by the end of trading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That trend continued Thursday with Morgan sliding $1.56 on
profit-taking to $179.69 and Chase Manhattan falling $1 to $50.19.
</P>
<P>
   Colgate-Palmolive shares fell $8.56 to $47.63, a 15 percent drop
after a Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown analyst downgraded the stock,
saying European currency woes and higher fuel costs would hurt the
consumer product maker's profits. Later in the day, the company
issued a statement saying it was comfortable with third-quarter
earnings estimates, but did not offer other specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-food company McDonald's was also down, declining $1.38 to
$26.63, after it warned late Wednesday that the euro's fall would
cut into its third-quarter earnings. Several analysts lowered their
earnings estimates for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 685.08 million
shares, compared to 697.96 million on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 4.09 to 538.09.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Vietnam Trip  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will visit Vietnam as one of
his final foreign tours as president, but will make the politically
sensitive trip only after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced Thursday that Clinton would tack the
Vietnam trip to the end of a scheduled visit to Brunei. Clinton is
to attend the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei, on Nov. 15 and 16 and then go to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president believes that ... consensus has developed in
this country over the last few years that the time was right to
move forward with this relationship,'' White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Trade, the continued recovery of remains of U.S. servicemen and
studies of the effect of the defoliant Agent Orange will likely be
on the agenda, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But there's just very much symbolic value in the president
visiting and going actually to visit the country,'' the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Clinton's predecessors visited Vietnam, according to the
State Department. President Johnson visited U.S. troops at Cam Ranh
Bay in October 1966 and December 1967. President Nixon met with
South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu in Saigon in July 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton discussed the possibility of a trip last week during a
brief meeting with Vietnamese President Tran Duc Long. Both leaders
were in New York to attend the U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has long said he would like to visit Vietnam, site of
the war that helped define his generation. Vietnam's political
isolation and Clinton's personal baggage complicated and delayed
that dream.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War cost the lives of 58,000 Americans and
approximately 3 million Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was in college and graduate school during the war years
and did not serve in Vietnam. Some of his critics still call him a
draft-dodger.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's choice of Al Gore, a Vietnam War veteran, as his
running mate in 1992 was seen then as one attempt to overcome a
potential political deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Making the trip after the election would lessen the chance that
controversy about Clinton's visit could hog news coverage when
Gore, now the Democratic presidential candidate, might need it
most.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Clinton has pursued a cautious rapprochement with
Vietnam. He lifted the trade embargo against the communist
government in 1994, and the next year restored diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reopened the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi in 1996 and in 1998
issued his first waiver of a law that bars trade relations with
communist nations that deny citizens the right to emigrate.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Clinton dispatched Defense Secretary William
Cohen to Vietnam as the first U.S. secretary of defense to visit
since the war ended in April 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's trip was intended to reinforce the Pentagon's commitment
to finding, recovering and returning to their families the remains
of 2,000 U.S. servicemen still unaccounted for from the war.
</P>
<P>
   It was also aimed at conveying the Clinton administration's
interest in ties between American and Vietnamese armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Airport Capacity Linked to Delays  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inadequate airport capacity is a significant
contributor -- along with bad weather -- to increasing incidences of
flight delays, a Clinton administration official told Congress
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should the entire national air system have to put up with
an endless number of flights scheduled from an airport that can't
handle them,'' Kenneth Mead, inspector general of the
Transportation Department, asked at a hearing on this summer's
massive flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at a hearing of the Senate Commerce and Transportation
Committee, Mead said that because of this, communities which resist
airport expansion may find themselves getting bypassed.
</P>
<P>
   As recent storm-caused problems have illustrated, the national
aviation system can be disrupted by flight delays and cancellations
in a single place.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that airport's capacity isn't going to be increased, it's
importance in the national system has to diminish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., convened the session to
ask questions about the air traffic hold-ups and to seek solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The key question, Mead said, is what traffic level the national
system can handle.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administrator Jane Garvey confirmed that her
agency is developing a set of capacity benchmarks for the nation's
30 or so largest airports to determine how many flights can be
handled safely.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you continue to add flights beyond that you are going to
add to the pain threshold of the traveling public and you are going
to stretch the capacity of air traffic control beyond what would be
reasonable,'' Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   Severe weather and a dispute with union pilots at United
Airlines have been blamed for many of this year's delays and
cancellations, but Mead, Garvey and Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater also agreed that the massive increases in air traffic are
straining the system.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few new runways have been built in recent years and
controversy surrounds plans to expand airports or build new ones in
other places.
</P>
<P>
   Without expansion the importance of a particular airport ''in
the overall national scheme of things may have to change,'' said
Slater.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pure politics is the problem at Chicago O'Hare,'' commented
McCain. ''They either have to expand or build another airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., asked Slater to explain
how an airport's importance could diminish without expansion. He
suggested San Francisco as a potential example.
</P>
<P>
   Slater responded that if expansion were needed in San Francisco
and local officials or residents blocked it, the result would
likely be less international traffic there, with the government
routing overseas flights to Los Angeles or Seattle instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a national (aviation) system but increasing runways
relies on local decisionmaking. The national dimension of this
calls for new thinking,'' Rockefeller commented.
</P>
<P>
   But, Slater quickly added that he doesn't foresee a time when
the federal government would be dictating new runways at particular
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, Washington needs to work closely with state
and local officials and must communicate the importance of aviation
to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's airline delays and cancellations have resulted in
a lot of blame being placed on airlines, the air traffic control
system and airports, but Slater said his department is now working
cooperatively with all groups to find solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives attended a recent meeting at the department
to discuss cooperation, and some carriers have begun making changes
in their systems to reduce delays, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are on the right track. We are at the magical moment. The
parties have come to the table,'' Slater told the committee.

<HEADLINE> Few Laws Deal With Ads in Schools  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager for team uniforms and new computers, the
nation's schools -- with little state oversight -- are making deals
that bring soda machines, PG-rated movie commercials and marketing
surveys onto their grounds, congressional investigators said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a cold, calculated effort,'' said Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., worried that the ads may promote unhealthy or
inappropriate activities or products for schoolchildren. ''Many
schools and parents are not prepared for the onslaught of
marketers.''
</P>
<P>
   The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, said little about whether the school ads were
appropriate. It mainly looked at how states regulated everything
from on-campus soda machines, company logos on athletic scoreboards
and television ads on Channel One or commercial stations shown in
classrooms, to corporate gifts and grants.
</P>
<P>
   Only California, New York, Florida, Illinois and Maine
specifically limit certain types of advertising and other
commercial activity within their public school buildings, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said just 19 state laws even address school-related
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Company representatives have defended their contracts and
sponsorships, saying they provide valuable resources and a
high-profile commitment to an embattled public education system.
</P>
<P>
   Channel One, a daily news broadcast that offers free television
sets and satellite dishes to schools reserving reserve time for
students to watch the show, earns high ratings from teachers, says
Eileen Murphy, spokeswoman for Primedia, Channel One's parent
company.
</P>
<P>
   She said ads on the show are approved by a committee of
educators. ''We have never had a complaint,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said officials rarely needed permission from parents
or others to use commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the nation's 86,000 schools participate in some
type of program, where they get cash or equipment based on the
receipts or proof-of-purchase coupons.
</P>
<P>
   No one has made a comprehensive count of commercial contracts in
the nation's schools, though the report maintains such deals are
growing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Grand Rapids, Mich., a contract with a soft
drink company guaranteed the district $30 per student, or 0.4
percent of the district's $206 million budget. In another district,
not named in the report, a school rented its softball field to a
production company shooting an episode of the former steamy
prime-time soap, ''Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   Some districts bowed out of contracts because parents
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Current laws -- mainly covering fund-raisers like candy and
gift-wrap sales -- were weak, varied and offered little guidance to
schools boards, superintendents and principals, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., was troubled by the finding that
many companies gathered address, ZIP code and purchasing habit
information from students, a practice that school officials said
they sometimes were unaware of.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we're trying to do is put up a warning sign,'' he said.
''The three R's should not stand for retail, resale and rebate.''

<HEADLINE> West Nile Virus Claims 8th Israeli  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Anxiety in Israel was growing Thursday after
the West Nile virus killed an eighth victim this summer, and
hospital emergency rooms were crowded with people who feared they
had contracted the mosquito-borne disease.
</P>
<P>
   In two dozen towns in Israel's hardest hit coastal plain,
residents closed their windows this week as machines belched forth
clouds of insecticide mixed with diesel oil to wipe out the
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Israel, 3,300 geese were destroyed at a farm after
some of the birds died of the disease. There were minor outbreaks
among geese at other farms but no wholesale slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Most flocks have been vaccinated against the virus, said Dr.
Oded Nir, chief veterinarian at the Ministry of Agriculture. ''This
is not like last year's outbreak of the virus in New York where
they had crows falling out of the sky,'' Nir said.
</P>
<P>
   There was little chance the outbreaks in New York and Israel
were connected, officials said. The virus was probably brought to
Israel by wild birds migrating from Europe to Africa, said Dr. Alex
Leventhal, the Health Ministry's director of public health.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned by the cases in Israel, neighboring Jordan asked
hospitals and clinics throughout the kingdom to notify the Health
Ministry if any cases were detected.
</P>
<P>
   Eight people in Israel have died this summer, and 120 more have
contracted the disease. The latest victim was Nurit Gurwitz, 54,
from Rishon Lezion, south of Tel Aviv, who was hospitalized two
weeks ago and died Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gurwitz' family was only informed a few hours before her death
that she had contracted the illness, said her husband, Shlomo,
suggesting that his wife did not received the proper treatment from
the start. The hospital denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of growing anxiety, hospital emergency rooms were
crowded with people with mild influenza who thought they had the
West Nile virus, which can be deadly for patients with a weak
immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ''We calm them down and send them home, but more keep coming,''
said Dr. Motte Ravid, director of internal medicine at a hospital
in Kfar Sava.
</P>
<P>
   Most cases were diagnosed in Israel's coastal plain, where many
migratory birds rest after long flights. None were in Jerusalem,
which is in the hills. ''The birds don't stop in Jerusalem and
there are fewer mosquitoes there,'' Leventhal said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the number of cases does not in itself constitute an
epidemic, but that nobody could tell how many mild or undetected
cases there were. ''It could be the tip of the iceberg,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The virus has been known in Israel for decades. Outbreaks were
recorded among Israeli soldiers in the 1950s and 1980s. Fifteen
percent of Israelis have antibodies against the virus, indicating
they had it in the past. All the wild birds tested in Israel's
national parks carry the antibodies, Leventhal said.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus was first identified in the West Nile District
of Uganda in 1937 and is present in East Africa, southwest Asia and
Europe. In humans, it can cause fatal encephalitis -- an
inflammation of the spinal cord and brain.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the first U.S. case of West Nile virus was reported
in late August, and a total of seven people in the New York City
area died and 62 were infected. There have been no deaths in the
United States this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Health Ministry has urged local authorities to spray
stagnant water, drains and sewers with insecticide and asked the
public to use insect repellent.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been accused of not reacting quickly enough
to the outbreak. The Association of Local Authorities demanded a
free hand to use the dusting machines in every city, but the
Environment Ministry refused and dusting could only be used in
areas where people or animals had contracted the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no objection to its being used in orchards or citrus
groves, but it can cause distress to asthma sufferers and
irritation to the skin,'' said Yiftah Kramer, spokesman of the
Environment Ministry. ''Therefore we have strict criteria for its
use in residential areas.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Holds on European Duties  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To ease growing trade tensions with Europe,
President Clinton has decided to hold off -- for now -- slapping
heavy duties on a new set of luxury imports such as Scottish
cashmere sweaters, French mineral water, Italian cheese and British
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   New import duties on the goods are a way to retaliate against
the European Union's trade barriers to U.S. beef produced with
growth hormones and to bananas grown on American-run plantations in
the Caribbean and South America.
</P>
<P>
   But at a United Nations summit in New York last week, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair pleaded with Clinton to hold off
publishing the list of goods to be sanctioned. He was especially
concerned about tariffs on British cashmere. Blair argued that the
action would aggravate the already-strained trade relations between
the EU and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to make a decision,'' White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart said Thursday. ''We're in the process now of deciding
how we will continue to deal with what we believe is intransigence
on the side of the Europeans. A final decision on what items will
be sanctioned has not been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the administration targeted $191.4 million worth of
European exports ranging from French handbags to British bed linens
for punitive 100 percent tariffs in the banana case.
</P>
<P>
   In the beef case, the United States imposed 100 percent tariffs
on $116.8 million worth of European products ranging from Danish
ham to German chocolate and French mustard and Roquefort cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Those sanctions amount to a 100 percent tariff. Such a tariff
would mean that a bottle of mineral water that once cost $1 would
now cost $2, explained Brendan Daly, a spokesman for the U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky. He too stressed that the list
had not been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Tariffs have been placed on various European products before,
but the list is to change periodically -- a ploy to make it
unpredictable and exert even more pressure on Europe to open its
market to beef and bananas.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in deciding the list of products to be sanctioned also
gives the administration more time to resolve another sticky trade
issue: Tax breaks that the United States gives major American
exporters, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   American businesses are able to avoid billions of dollars in
taxes every year by sheltering some foreign sales in offshore shell
companies. Earlier this year, the World Trade Organization ruled
that this practice, allowed under U.S. tax law, violated
international trade agreements. The WTO said the EU could retaliate
against the United States by sanctioning U.S. goods if America
didn't comply by Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration reworked the tax law. The House
approved the change Wednesday. The Senate is expected to take up
the measure soon.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 78; Nasdaq Advances 55  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chips fell sharply Thursday on
profit-taking and concerns about the drop in the euro currency, but
technology stocks moved higher for a second straight session on
speculation about upbeat corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 78.06 to 11,104.12 in late
afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index was up
54.85 at 3,948.74, but the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 0.35 to
1,484.56.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, Wall Street got a lift from the Labor
Department's report that wholesale prices fell an unexpected 0.2
percent last month, the first drop in four months. The decline
followed a flat reading in the Producer Price Index in July.
</P>
<P>
   The report was further evidence that the economy is slowing and
reassured investors that the inflation-wary Fed is unlikely to
raise rates for a seventh time since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some good data today for the soft-landing scenario, but
obviously there is still not enough confidence overall to get
things totally on track,'' said Ronald J. Hill, an investment
strategist and partner at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. ''But the
course of prices is more likely, in our opinion, going to go up
than down.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks moved higher, including Conexant Systems,
which rose $16.81 to $53.88, a 45 percent increase. The company
announced late Wednesday it was spinning its Internet
infrastructure business off into a separate company.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle traded up $2.88 at $84.69 on investor anticipation of its
quarterly earnings report, due out late Thursday. A Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter analyst also upgraded the stock to ''strong buy'' from
''outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems was up $1.07 at $62.39.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq is playing a little catch up because they had a
serious setback of underperfomance as we got into September,'' said
Hill, the Brown Brothers Harriman analyst. ''The Dow got a big
boost because of J.P. Morgan speculation. Now that the deal is
known, there's less of a single driver that's pushing the Dow.''
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan Bank announced Wednesday they
were merging. Morgan's shares had been inching upwards on
speculation a deal was in the works, but the announcement sent both
companies stocks down by the end of trading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That trend continued Thursday with Morgan sliding $1.94 on
profit-taking to $179.13 and Chase Manhattan falling $1 to $50.19.
</P>
<P>
   Colgate-Palmolive shares fell $8.95 to $47.25, a 15 percent drop
after a Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown analyst downgraded the stock,
saying European currency woes and higher fuel costs would hurt the
consumer product maker's profits. Later in the day, the company
issued a statement saying it was comfortable with third-quarter
earnings estimates without offering other specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-food company McDonald's was also down, declining $1.19 to
$26.81, after it warned late Wednesday that the euro's fall would
cut into its third-quarter earnings. Several analysts lowered their
earnings estimates for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 809.59 million
shares, compared to 838.31 million on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 5.32 to 539.32.

<HEADLINE> Siamese Twins May Not Be Doomed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Siamese twins at the heart of a legal battle
between doctors and the babies' parents may not be doomed to die
within months, a lawyer for the parents told an appeals court
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, who are Roman Catholics from an unidentified
European country, oppose the operation and have appealed a
lower-court decision in favor of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The twins, joined at the lower abdomen, were born Aug. 8 at St.
Mary's Hospital in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the hospital believe both girls will die within six
months if they are not separated, but that one -- identified as
Jodie -- could survive on her own. The less-developed twin, Mary,
could not survive separation, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Taylor, counsel for the parents, said a cardiologist from
London who examined the twins thought there was at least a 10
percent to 20 percent chance that the children could survive more
than six months.
</P>
<P>
   A surgeon also thought the twins could live together many
months, perhaps even a few years, Taylor told the three judges
hearing the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm aware that that raises a horrible spectre of survival
going into years -- God knows how many years -- but it exists,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Justice Alan Ward commented that these opinions were
''pretty vague,'' but Taylor said he raised them only because of
the repeated assertion that the weaker twin would die in any case.
</P>
<P>
   The ProLife Alliance, which campaigns against abortion and
euthanasia, informed the court in a written submission that it had
offered the parents a ''safe haven'' in Italy for the family. The
group's attorney, David Anderson, said the parents might consider
leaving Britain if they lose their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also argued that permitting an operation to separate
the twins -- knowing that Mary would die as a result -- would violate
the European Convention on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Article 2 of the human rights convention guarantees the right to
life and declares that ''no one shall be deprived of life
intentionally,'' save in the case of a criminal ordered to be
executed under due process of law, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, ''to perform an operation whose consequence is
acknowledged to be Mary's death -- whether or not it is judged to be
murder as a matter of English law -- will be an intentional
deprivation of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Owen, an attorney appointed to represent Jodie, argued that
the convention included an obligation to protect life, and would
not rule out the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic archbishop of England and Wales, Cormac
Murphy-O'Connor, submitted written arguments supporting the
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mary's right to life should be respected because (a) she
possesses the same basic worth and dignity which belongs to every
human being, and (b) she has done nothing which could justify
killing her,'' the archbishop said.

<HEADLINE> Elton John Walks Out on Concert  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Elton John walked out on a sold-out
concert just 30 minutes before it was supposed to start, organizers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The singer appeared worried that the theater at the Estoril
Casino near Lisbon was half-empty, casino spokesman Nuno Lima de
Carvalho said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he was going out to get some air, but then he jumped
into his car and went to the airport to catch his private jet. He
never said goodbye or anything to anyone,'' Lima de Carvalho said.
</P>
<P>
   De Carvalho said the audience of 1,250 people, including
government ministers and bank presidents, was slow to move from the
dining room Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The casino is considering legal action, he said. Tickets for the
show cost more than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Carey, a London spokesman for the singer, said he was
unaware of the incident and had no comment.

<HEADLINE> Stem Cell Research Funding Urged  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael J. Fox and Mary Tyler Moore urged
lawmakers Thursday to release federal funding for research
involving embryonic stem cells, which the actors say could lead to
cures for diseases such as Parkinson's, juvenile diabetes and
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   ''The consistent and inescapable conclusion is that this
research offers the potential to eliminate diseases, literally
saving millions of lives,'' said Fox, who just won an Emmy for the
ABC sitcom ''Spin City.'' ''I can't help but say, respectfully,
enough! It's time to act on what we've learned. ... Further delay
would come at a high price.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox left the show in May to devote more time to fighting
Parkinson's, a progressive neurological disorder that he has
contracted.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has promised a vote
within the month on legislation allowing funding for research on
stem cells from discarded human embryos, said Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Penn., chairman of the Appropriations Committee's Health and
Human Services panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we have the votes,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,
who co-sponsored Specter's legislation. ''I hope we have the
votes.''
</P>
<P>
   However, critics oppose the research, calling it illegal,
immoral and unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a cure for diabetes and a host of other ailments require
the production and destruction of human embryos, then I beg you to
consider the possibility that some diseases are better than their
cure,'' said Russell Saltzman, pastor of Ruskin Heights Lutheran
Church in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are embryonic stem cells, the master cells that in very
early embryos generate all the other tissues of the body.
Scientists think those stem cells possibly could cure diseases like
Alzheimer's, diabetes, or Parkinson's, or even repair broken spinal
cords.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal government has not funded any research into
embryonic stem cells because of a congressional ban on any research
that destroys human embryos. Taking stem cells from embryos does
destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health has proposed allowing federal
funding of research on stem cells that are removed from human
embryos but forbidding research on the embryo itself.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's legislation would go further, letting women agree to
donate to federally funded researchers their leftover embryos from
in-vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   But Saltzman, who has diabetes, said just because the embryos
were going to be discarded doesn't mean it is right to use them for
medical research. ''We should not use human life for the benefit of
human life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin noted that the embryos in question are no bigger than the
period at the end of a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The embryos that are being discussed, according to science,
bear as much resemblance to a human being as a goldfish,'' said
Moore, star of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' that aired from 1970
to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're dealing with flesh and blood people now who feel and
deal with real debilitation right now and our obligation is to
those who are here,'' said Moore, who suffers from juvenile
diabetes and chairs the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not opposed to research,'' said Ron Heagy, who is a
quadriplegic, paralyzed from the neck down. ''I'm not opposed to
walking again. I'm just opposed to the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Darwin Prockop, director of gene therapy at the Tulane
University Medical Center, said researchers are getting close to
major breakthroughs with adult stem cell research, with clinical
trials on patients with Parkinson's expected in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   But Prockop said embryonic cell research should proceed. ''We
are simply not ready for a moon-shot like strategy in which we
place all our bets on adult stem cells,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Forces Training in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said Thursday that 200 U.S.
special forces troops training in the Philippines will not be
involved in the Philippine government's confrontation with
kidnappers. Special Filipino troops might benefit from their
participation in the training, a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine government officials have suggested they might be
planning an assault against a rebel group involved in kidnappings
in the southern Philippines. Muslim rebels holding 19 Filipino and
foreign hostages threatened Thursday to attack local cities if the
military launched an assault.
</P>
<P>
   The special forces training was planned more than a year ago and
is the third or fourth such exercise this year, said a Pentagon
spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not being done to train the Philippine special
operations forces, although there is certainly side benefit of
that, of them being present and training along with our forces,''
Quigley said. A few dozen Filipino troops are involved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is primarily being done because of the climate and the
geography and the landscape that you find in the Philippines as a
very good training ground to provide the training for U.S. special
operations forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Training has already begun and is expected to last about 45
days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no knowledge of the government of the Philippines
intentions as to how they plan on resolving the hostage
situation,'' Quigley said, adding that U.S. officials hope all
hostages will be released immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Separatists Muslims recently releases several of their foreign
hostages in exchange for millions of dollars supplied by Libya, but
they angered Philippine government officials by kidnapping three
more people from a Malaysian diving resort on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> National Guard, Army To Align  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The Army announced a redesign of
National Guard combat divisions Thursday that aligns them more
closely with active-duty forces. The move will require better Guard
training and make it more likely that part-time soldiers will be
called to fight in future wars.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about readiness,'' Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army chief of
staff, said in an interview with The Associated Press. He spoke
after announcing the changes at a meeting of the National Guard
Association of the United States, a booster group that has pressed
for closer ties between active and reserve forces.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki said it is not clear how much more money the National
Guard will need to improve training, but working more closely with
active-duty troops will make their training more focused on combat
missions.
</P>
<P>
   If the National Guard is to win a bigger share of Army funds,
''you're going to have to tie the Guard (divisions) to missions,''
the four-star general said. The eight Guard combat divisions, which
were designed mainly as reinforcements for Europe during the Cold
War, no longer have specific missions.
</P>
<P>
   The change reflects Army leaders' search for ways to make better
use of the National Guard at a time when the active-duty force is
stretched thin by a variety of peacetime missions at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Army National Guard has 360,000 members in 3,200 units in
2,700 communities across the nation. The active-duty Army has
470,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki also addressed one of the most pressing needs of the
National Guard: modernizing its aging helicopter fleet. He said 122
UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters and 68 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters
will be shifted from the active force to the Guard in 2002 to
replacing older UH-1 Hueys.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki is aligning the Guard combat divisions with four Army
corps. A corps is the largest combat organization in the Army. This
will focus Guard training on specific potential wartime missions
such as rear-area combat operations in a major conflict in the
Persian Gulf, reinforcement of U.S. forces on the Korean peninsula
or filling in for active-duty units in Germany that might be sent
to fight elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrangement means members of National Guard combat
divisions are more likely to be called on not only for war-fighting
but also as rotation units for peacekeeping in places like Bosnia
and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The change does not make National Guard divisions a part of the
Pentagon's official war plans, which are written by the commanders
in chief, or CINCs, of combat commands.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki said the next step is for the CINCs to designate Guard
units for specific missions in their war plans.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki announced four corps ''packages'':
</P>
<P>
   --Pairing the 5th Corps, headquartered at Heidelberg, Germany,
with the 35th Infantry Division of the Kansas National Guard. The
5th Corps' operational focus is Europe. The 35th will be ''teamed''
with Fort Riley, Kan., home of active-duty brigades of the 1st
Infantry Division and the 1st Armored Division.
</P>
<P>
   Also part of the 5th Corps team will be two separate National
Guard brigades, the 256th Infantry Brigade of the Louisiana
National Guard and the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment of the
Tennessee National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   --The 1st Corps, based at Fort Lewis, Wash., will be aligned with
the 40th Infantry Division of the California National Guard. The
1st Corps' main mission is preparing for potential war on the
Korean peninsula. Fort Lewis is home to one active-duty brigade
each of the 2nd Infantry Division and 25th Infantry Division.
</P>
<P>
   --Aligned with the 3rd Corps will be three National Guard
divisions: the 49th Armored of Texas, the 34th Infantry of
Minnesota and the 38th Infantry of Indiana. The 3rd Corps is based
at Fort Hood, Texas, and is geared toward providing the
counter-punch offensive force in any major war.
</P>
<P>
   --The 18th Airborne Corps, based at Fort Bragg, N.C., will be
paired with the 29th Infantry Division of the Maryland and Virginia
National Guard; the 28th Infantry Division of the Pennsylvania
Guard, and the 42nd Infantry Division of the New York Guard. The
18th Airborne Corps is designed to be a rapid-reaction force to
intervene in the Gulf or other hotspots around the world.

<HEADLINE> Trees May Hold Secret of Atlantis  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ancient pine tree stumps found in a Swedish
peat bog may hold a record of the great volcanic blast that some
historians associate with the end of the fabled Atlantis.
</P>
<P>
   Using radiocarbon dating, a team of researchers determined that
the trees had been alive between 1695 B.C. and 1496 B.C., and a
study of their growth rings showed a four-year period of severely
depressed growth about 1636 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Major volcanic eruptions have been known to blast enough dust
into the atmosphere to cause frosts and limit crop growth, and one
of the most powerful such blasts occurred when the Greek island of
Santorini blew up in the mid-1600s B.C.
</P>
<P>
   That disaster destroyed a culturally developed island and some
historians believe it gave rise to the legend of the lost continent
Atlantis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our dating and the severe magnitude of this phenomenon suggest
that it can be ascribed to the 1628-27 B.C. event, hence providing
new evidence of a wider, more northerly area of influence,'' the
team of Swedish scientists reports in the Sept. 15 issue of
Geophysical Research Letters.
</P>
<P>
   While the team led by Hakan Grudd of the Climate Impacts
Research Center in Kiruna, Sweden, dated the Santorini blast to
1628, other scholars use different dates, though all are within a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish team said their tree ring dating had a margin of
error of plus or minus 65 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists studying tree rings have found periods of frost
damage and slow growth in the mid-1600s B.C. affecting Irish,
English, and German oaks, pine trees in California and trees in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   This is the northernmost evidence of an effect from the volcanic
blast, the researchers said of the new Swedish find.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis of a major
Northern Hemisphere volcanic eruption in 1628 B.C., which may have
been Santorini in the Aegean Sea,'' they concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The climate impact of volcanoes has long been a topic of
discussion, going back at least to Benjamin Franklin. The eruption
of the Indonesian volcano Tambora was blamed for a worldwide
cooling in 1816 -- known as the ''year without a summer'' in New
England, where snow fell in June.
</P>
<P>
   Today Santorini is a popular tourist spot, where visitors can
see the great caldera formed when the ancient volcanic island blew
up and view excavations uncovering the remains of the ancient town.
</P>
<P>
   The first mention of Atlantis occurs in Plato, who discusses an
ancient island or continent destroyed by earthquakes and sunk into

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Lift Ban on Judge Fees  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate bill would lift an 11-year-old ban on
federal judges supplementing their incomes with speaking fees, a
measure that has the backing of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   After Rehnquist wrote a letter to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
supporting the idea, language ending the prohibition was included
in a spending bill covering the judiciary and the departments of
Justice, Commerce and State. That measure passed the Senate
Appropriations Committee on July 18, but has yet to come to the
Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The provision would affect the 1,500 federal judges with
lifetime appointments, whom Rehnquist argued have salaries matched
by some first-year associates in law firms. Federal judges' annual
pay ranges from $181,400 for the chief justice to $141,300 for
district judges, and does not rise annually to match inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The disparity between the salaries of the judicial and legal
profession cannot continue indefinitely without compromising the
morale of the federal judiciary and eventually its quality,''
Rehnquist wrote in his April 27 letter to McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement on Thursday, Rehnquist said he has long
supported boosting judges' salaries, at least to stay even with
inflation. He said he wrote to McConnell after the senator's office
contacted him about legislation McConnell was planning that would
lift the ban on judges receiving such fees, called honoraria.
</P>
<P>
   ''I indicated that I would support Sen. McConnell's efforts
because easing the ban on honoraria would at least provide
assistance to some judges,'' Rehnquist said. ''I remain committed
to pay increases for federal judges.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the proposal is unclear. No such language exists in
the House version of the spending bill, and some key Democrats
expressed reservations about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's outrageous,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., the top
Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. ''It'll go
somewhere over my dead body. I don't believe in judges or members
of Congress going around the country giving speeches for money.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It erodes confidence in judges' independence, it fosters
conflicts of interest, and it invites cynicism about the courts,''
said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the top Democrat on the Senate
Judiciary Committee. ''Even worse, there's no accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics outside of Congress also say the plan would invite
potential conflicts of interest for judges.
</P>
<P>
   ''Honoraria are fees for service,'' said Fred Werthheimer,
president of Democracy 21, a private group that favors the
tightening of campaign finance and ethics rules. ''Lifetime judges
with the general responsibility for enforcing the law should not be
working in the employ of outside private interests. There should be
only one master for a judge, and that is the general public and the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to McConnell, Rehnquist said he is ''confident''
that the Judicial Conference -- the administrative arm of the
federal courts -- ''would provide reasonable guidelines or
regulations on honoraria to minimize potential abuses or
appearances of impropriety.''
</P>
<P>
   In a May 2 letter to Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who chairs the
Senate Appropriations subcommittee that wrote the spending bill,
McConnell said lifting the honoraria ban ''would help address the
expanding salary gap and allow the federal judiciary to determine
its own ethical standards for the receipt'' of the fees.
</P>
<P>
   A 1989 law banned federal judges, members of Congress and many
top executive branch officials from accepting speaking fees. Judges
can make up to $21,195 a year from other outside sources, such as
by teaching, and may also receive trips to some professional events
that are paid for.
</P>
<P>
   Congress controls judges' salaries, which by tradition only rise
when lawmakers raise their own pay. The raise automatically happens
every year unless Congress votes to block it.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress are expected to grant themselves a 2.7
percent raise that will take effect in January, the third raise in
the past four years. Before that, the last raise took effect in
January 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The pay increase is legally limited by a formula that links it
to inflation and to raises the president proposes for federal civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
   The move to end the prohibition on judges' honoraria was first
reported in Thursday's Washington Post.

<HEADLINE> FDA May Ease Ban on Gay Blood Donors  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- The government is considering easing
the ban on gay male blood donors, citing better blood safety
testing and an increasingly urgent need for more blood donations.
</P>
<P>
   All men who seek to donate blood are asked if they have had sex,
even once, with another man since 1977. Those who admit they have
are permanently banned from donating blood.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration asks its scientific advisers
Thursday whether it should change the blood-donation rule to ban
only men who had sex with another man within the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   It's a controversial move that has split the blood industry,
with half of the nation's blood banks supporting easing the policy
even more -- to one year instead of five -- while the American Red
Cross opposes any change.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the policy probably would result in about 62,300 gay
men seeking to donate blood, estimated FDA medical officer Dr.
Andrew Dayton. From them, 1.7 HIV-infected units of blood might
sneak into the blood supply, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All donated blood undergoes strict testing for the AIDS virus
and other blood-borne diseases -- that wouldn't change. But testing
isn't perfect. Of the nation's 12 million units of donated blood,
about 10 HIV-infected units sneak through each year, causing about
2-3 HIV infections a year, said Dr. Michael Busch of the University
of California-San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   So as an extra precaution, the FDA also requires blood banks to
question potential donors about their risks for HIV and other
diseases and refuse the blood of high-risk people.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on gay male donors was adopted in 1985 because the
deadly AIDS virus first appeared here as an epidemic in the gay
community. Later, other high-risk people were barred from donating,
such as intravenous drug users and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   But now -- with the nation bracing for blood shortages and new
genetic testing that promises to eliminate the rare cases of HIV
still caused by donated blood -- many blood banks are asking why
they have to turn away thousands of potentially healthy men.
</P>
<P>
   ''This modification should have no detrimental effect on ... the
safety of the blood supply,'' said Dr. Louis Katz of the American
Association of Blood Banks. His group thinks it would be safe to
ban only donations by men who had sex with men in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   And gay activists have been pushing to end a rule they call
discriminatory. Outside a San Francisco blood bank last January,
protesters argued that many gay men have been tested for HIV and
are in long-term, monogamous relationships that make them no more
of a threat than the average heterosexual.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Red Cross opposes the change, arguing that if
62,000 gay men donate blood, blood banks would have to catch an
extra 1,200 units of HIV-positive blood.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot change our procedures in a way that would result in
increased numbers of infectious donation in our blood supply,''
said Dr. Rebecca Haley, the Red Cross's chief medical officer.
</P>
<P>
   About eight percent of gay men have HIV, the government
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Only 8 million Americans donate blood, just 5 percent of
currently eligible donors. Blood donations are decreasing about 1
percent a year, while demand for blood is increasing by 1 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some cities routinely experience blood shortages during
holidays and the summer, when regular donors go on vacation, and
blood banks are bracing for more serious shortages if donations
continue to decline.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, all donated blood was tested for immune system
cells that fight HIV. But those antibodies may not appear until 80
days after an infection, so newly infected donors have sometimes
slipped through. Last year, however, blood banks began using a new
genetic test that they believe can largely eliminate that risk.
''Nucleic acid testing'' or NAT, can detect tiny amounts of a virus
before the donor's body has even recognized the infection, 11 days
after a person is infected.
</P>
<P>
   That means the test could easily catch HIV infection in a man
who had sex with an HIV-infected man a year ago, much less five,
said some blood banks that urged the FDA to go with a one-year
policy instead.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just an issue in the United States. Last spring, a
human rights commission in South Africa ruled that gay men have a
constitutional right to donate blood.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Patients' Rights Vote  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Complaining that 50,000 Americans encounter a
delay or denial of medical care every day, President Clinton
accused Republicans of abusing their power by preventing a Senate
vote to expand managed-care patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time is running out in Congress and there is no more important
piece of unfinished business,'' the president said Thursday at a
ceremony to increase election-year pressure on Republicans. The
White House served notice it would make a political issue out of
the bill if Republicans block it, as appears likely.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to believe that in this case the narrow special
interests will thwart the clear will of the Senate and the House,
but if that is the case the ultimate arbiter will be the ballot box
on Election Day,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined at the podium on the south driveway of the
White House by 20 osteopaths and physicians, all dressed in long
white medical coats. An electronic counter, atop an ambulance with
flashing lights, ticked off the number of Americans who have had
their health care denied or delayed since the House passed the
bipartisan measure by Reps. Charles Norwood, R-Ga., and John
Dingell, D-Mich. -- one every 1.74 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton began to speak, the counter read 16,980,173. When
he finished, it had clicked up to 16,990,489.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the Norwood-Dingell bill last fall. Clinton
said there are enough votes to pass it in the Senate, but
Republicans are planning to filibuster any attempt to bring it up.
It takes a simple majority -- 51 votes -- to pass a bill in the
Senate but it requires a three-fifths margin -- 60 votes -- to stop a
filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sept. 18, the ambulance, painted with the slogan
''Pass the Patients' Bill of Rights,'' will travel to events in
Delaware, Michigan, Pennsylvania and other states where rallies
will be held to urge reluctant senators to pass the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nearly 50,000 Americans every day face a delay or denial of
care,'' the president said. ''Nearly 50,000. Every hour, more than
2,000 people fail to get the treatment they need.''
</P>
<P>
   The most contentious provision of the bill would give consumers
the right to sue HMOs for inadequate care. Senate Republicans say
the measure would increase health care costs and lead to a barrage
of lawsuits. Clinton said the increase would be less than $2 a
month and would be worth the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Health Plans, representing more than
1,000 HMOs, took issue with Clinton. ''Supporters call this a new
bill but it continues to rely on predatory lawsuits, and this is a
significant stumbling block for enacting real patient protection,''
AAHP President Karen Ignagni. She said that if the Norwood-Dingell
bill is approved, the ambulance on the White House lawn ''will be
chased by a legion of trial lawyers in hot pursuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the bill deserves to come to a vote, but ''an abuse
of the filibuster system'' is preventing that.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to persuade the leadership of the Senate to let a
majority vote on this, and if a majority's for it, to pass it,''
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Pataki announces funding for Great Lakes projects  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Some $560,000 in state money is going to
schools, agencies and environmental groups for projects relating to
the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 10 proposals were funded, Gov. George Pataki
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Lakes projects were funded through the state's Great
Lakes Protection Fund for 2000-2001, created in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The State University's Oswego campus got the largest single
grant, $99,956 to research the degradation in confined disposal
facilities, the storage areas where polluted dredge has to be
deposited by law.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the other projects receiving funding:
</P>
<P>
   -SUNY Syracuse, $99,729, to develop a model to assess salmon and
trout production potential in Lake Ontario's tributaries.
</P>
<P>
   -SUNY Buffalo, $84,961 to help quantify contaminant trends in
fish and wildlife in Lake Ontario.
</P>

<HEADLINE> White House Opposes Alaska Drilling  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said Thursday
rising fuel prices do not justify new oil drilling in
environmentally sensitive parts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has long opposed new exploration in
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and in several other
protected areas, arguing that the potential for harm to the
environment far outweighs possible gains in oil production.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president, at his core, does not believe that the right
approach here is to start drilling in Alaska or in the protected
areas,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no consideration of that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The price of oil is near a 10-year high, affecting gasoline and
home heating oil prices as fall weather approaches. The Energy
Department predicts home heating oil will cost 30 percent more this
winter than it did last, and natural gas will cost 27 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has other options to try to lower oil prices,
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have a number of ways that we have promoted to
decrease our dependence on foreign oil,'' he said. ''Unfortunately,
most of those have been stymied by the Republican Congress. We
continue to work. You'll see in some areas where they've blocked
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, congressional Republicans accused the Clinton-Gore
administration of squandering U.S. influence with oil-producing
nations and standing helpless to protect consumers now.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's Democratic presidential campaign shot back that
Republican rival George W. Bush has no energy policy at all, other
than ''to let his friends in the oil industry drill our wilderness
areas,'' as spokesman Doug Hattaway put it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposes tax breaks to help consumers buy an upcoming
generation of fuel-efficient vehicles as well as incentives for
energy efficient homes and cleaner power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed allowing drilling in the coastal strip of the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Centers To Help Out Parents  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Deborah Pryce is a lawyer, former judge and a
member of Congress. Yet she felt helpless and ''almost frozen with
fear'' when forced to select the right treatment for her daughter's
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got so much conflicting information and conflicting advice
on the treatment to get and where to turn for help,'' she said.
''These are life-and-death decisions. When you're paralyzed with
fear and grief it's so difficult to know who to trust.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, families facing such decisions should have access
to better information now that 237 cancer centers and children's
hospitals have decided to work together, coordinating their
research and setting up a national childhood cancer database. The
cooperative effort was announced Thursday at a Capitol Hill news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''How we have worked, unfortunately, has in some ways been in
competition,'' said Dr. Gregory Reaman, executive director of the
Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at the Children's National
Medical Center. ''To some extent we were working at
cross-purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We as pediatric oncologists have a single enemy and that is
the cancer our children develop,'' Reaman said as he and other
cancer experts joined Pryce to announce the merger of four networks
of research hospitals into the unified Children's Oncology Group.
</P>
<P>
   Having the experts in agreement about the best types of
treatment for the different stages and kinds of cancer should make
it easier for parents trying to become instant experts on the
disease and the latest research, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will greatly assist families at the time of diagnosis that
are faced with decisions,'' Reaman said. ''There will be single
recommendations for clinical trials, making sure that every child,
regardless of where they live, has access.''
</P>
<P>
   The merged group intends to create a more efficient system for
collecting information about pediatric cancer cases and about the
results of various treatments and research programs. That, in turn,
should step up the pace of research into childhood cancer, Reaman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger has been in place for a few months, but many details
remain to be worked out, said Dr. G. Denman Hammond, professor of
pediatrics at the University of Southern California-Keck School of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   After Pryce's daughter, Caroline Pryce Walker, was diagnosed
with neuroblastoma in 1998, the congresswoman found herself
confronting specialists who laid out a series of options but who
didn't agree on how best to combat the rare, aggressive form of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Pryce, R-Ohio, eventually got Caroline into a program at a New
York hospital that allowed treatments to be administered from a
hospital close to home in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline died Sept. 4, 1999. She was 9 years old.

<HEADLINE> McCall critical of oversight of welfare programs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - State comptroller H. Carl McCall on Thursday
accused New York labor officials of doing a poor job monitoring
local welfare employment and training programs.
</P>
<P>
   McCall made the charge as he released an audit that found the
state Department of Labor was not making sure local agencies were
performing necessary case work such as assessing recipients' skills
and providing employment plans.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors examined 200 case files from New York City and Broome,
Jefferson, Niagara, Steuben and Ulster counties. Among their
findings: employability assessments were not done 20 percent of the
time; there was no record of an evaluation of the recipient's
literacy or English language skills 39 percent of the time; 30
percent of the case files had no employment plans; there was no
record that recipients were asked about previous job experiences 21
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said that state and local officials are accountable for
providing the tools necessary for able bodied recipients to get
work and that ''the state Department of Labor is not living up to
its responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   State labor officials responded that incomplete records do not
necessarily mean the work was not being done. State labor
department spokeswoman Betsy McCormack noted that New York state
has reduced its welfare rolls by 848,000 recipients since 1995,
surpassing federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we're doing a good job,'' McCormack said. ''Success
speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall released a second audit that found serious flaws in the
way state labor officials keep track of recipients' work hours. A
new Welfare to Work Caseload Management System promised since 1993
is now scheduled to be operational next spring.

   ''We should not bankrupt families for doing what is right for
their children,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who wants to
give parents yearly deductions that he says would save as much as
$2,800 per student on their tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Democrats' survey of 50 major private and
public colleges, the typical tuition rose from $3,904 in 1980 to
$17,772 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition and fees spiked in the early 1980s, with double-digit
annual rate increases, but such cost increases have leveled of in
recent years, Jeffrey Penn, an analyst with College Board, which
administers key college entrance exams and tracks college costs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, tuition costs for both public and private rose less
than 5 percent from 1998-99 to 1999-2000, Penn said.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawmakers -- saying tuitions have outpaced the cost of
health care and the rate of inflation -- contend that current costs
are shutting out students, who otherwise would be trained to help
the nation remain competitive in technology and other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time a young man or young woman does not go to college,
not only do they lose, and their families lose, but America
loses,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said the proposed tuition credit -- estimated to cost the
federal government $29 billion over 10 years -- is cheaper than
other tax-cut plans pushed by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is counting on momentum from a similar tuition
tax-deduction plan being pushed by Vice President Al Gore on the
presidential campaign trail. Gore has proposed expanding a current
maximum $2,000 tuition-tax credit to a $2,800 maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who does not offer a tax
credit, would allow parents to save money for college in special
tax-favored accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans had no immediate response to
Democrats' charge, but with a full plate of spending bills and
other plans, the tax-credit bill faces an uphill battle.

<HEADLINE> Indian Leader Addresses US Congress  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- India's prime minister asked for U.S.
understanding of his country's pursuit of a nuclear arms program in
what congressional leaders hailed as a historic speech Thursday on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We both share a commitment to ultimately eliminating nuclear
weapons,'' Atal Bihari Vajpayee said in an address to a joint
session of Congress, a prelude to his meeting Friday with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''India understands your concerns. ... We wish you to understand
our security concerns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments tackled head-on a main disagreement in U.S.-Indian
relations: India's decision to carry out nuclear tests two years
ago and its refusal to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee said it is not necessary for security to continue to
''cast a shadow'' over relations between the two countries, which
have improved greatly since the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the United States and the world's largest democracy
should unite against their common enemies of poverty, terrorism and
hunger to ''shape the character of the global economy in this
century,'' said Vajpayee, who delivered his speech seated rather
than standing because of a knee problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''India and the United States have much to gain from a close
relationship,'' he later told a lunch meeting of congressmen,
Indian-American businessmen and other guests.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House bill-signing ceremony, Clinton said the two
nations ''need to have a better and closer and more constructive
relationship.'' He added that he hoped the United States could help
end the dispute between India and Pakistan over violence-torn
Kashmir, a Himalayan territory split between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at how well the Indians, the Pakistanis, and the
Bangladeshis who have come to America have done -- the extraordinary
percentage of them who are involved in high-tech economy
professions -- it is tragic to think what this conflict has done to
hold back the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress, who frequently interrupted Vajpayee's
speech with applause, praised the speech and Vajpayee's assertion
that India and the United States are embarked on ''a new beginning
in our relations.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This truly illustrates India's growing importance to the
United States,'' House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said of
the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was historic, unprecedented, and I do so much hope that
events move as (the prime minister) so eloquently hoped they
would,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat
who once was U.S. ambassador to India.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., called Vajpayee's
invitation to work with the United States on a range of common
issues ''very forward leaning ... symbolizing a new stage in
U.S.-Indian relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., who heads the House International
Relations Committee subcommittee on Asia, noted that India has
taken some steps to open its markets. But he said the country
''would be well served by implementing additional economic reforms
and trade liberalization if it intends to become a major world
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting between Vajpayee and the House International
Relations Committee, Chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., noted
reports of violence against Christians in India and urged the prime
minister to assure religious freedom for all citizens of his
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has welcomed the closer ties with
India but has been concerned by an acceleration in the arms race,
triggered by India's decision to engage in nuclear weapons tests in
May 1998. Pakistan quickly followed suit with tests of its own. The
administration has been disappointed with the lack of progress in
getting India to sign the nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Touching on other subjects, Vajpayee said the United States and
India should redouble their efforts to combat terrorism. He
asserted that no country ''has faced as ferocious an attack of
terrorist violence as India over the past two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   This was an allusion to Pakistan, which strongly opposes
continued Indian control over part of Kashmir. Vajpayee made no
direct reference to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   During his stay here, Vajpayee also was expected to ask for
support for Indian membership in the U.N. Security Council and to
voice concerns about the U.S. sanctions imposed after the nuclear
tests that have not been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say Clinton wants to build on what they
regard as Clinton's successful visit to India in March.

<HEADLINE> Rally Draws Focus To Immigration  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Williams left his parents, siblings
and the violence in Liberia last year hoping for a better life in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the 19-year-old lost his job in Rhode Island
because, he says, he can't prove to his boss that he'll be in this
country beyond Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   That's the day that he and other Liberians who fled their civil
war-torn country will be eligible for deportation unless Congress
makes them permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in danger in Liberia -- everyone is in danger there,''
Williams said. ''The rebels have no clear goals on who to kill and
who not to kill, so they will kill anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been in touch with his family for months -- many people
in Liberia have no telephone service and mail is not delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the post offices were burned down in the war years,''
Williams said. ''And they haven't been rebuilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was one of about 300 Liberians who turned out for a
rally on Capitol Hill Thursday to draw attention to a pair of bills
that would grant them permanent resident status. Without it, the
Liberians and their supporters say, they face oppression, if not
death, back home.
</P>
<P>
   One woman at the rally held a poster-sized photograph of rows of
skulls covering the ground. The caption read: ''This is what awaits
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the longest-running immigration sagas of its kind,
10,000 to 15,000 Liberians have been living in the United States
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 live in Rhode Island; many others settled in
Massachusetts and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   When they first arrived, they received temporary protection
status which allows for a stay of six to 18 months for people whose
homeland is hit by natural disaster or war.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberians were granted extension after extension as the
civil war continued. But with the fighting officially over in 1997,
Attorney General Janet Reno decided last year that another
extension could not be made.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Clinton administration allowed the Liberians to
remain in America until Sept. 28 under a ''deferred enforced
departure'' status. Sen. Jack Reed, the Rhode Island Democrat
sponsoring the legislation, said President Clinton backs his bill.
Both Massachusetts senators are co-sponsors; so is Rhode Island
Sen. Lincoln Chafee, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I. is sponsoring a House version of
the bill that is not likely to come up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress doesn't make the Liberians permanent residents, the
Department of Immigration and Naturalization Service can hold off
deportation procedures or extend their current status.
</P>
<P>
   ''No decisions have been made now,'' said Eyleen Schmidt, an INS
spokeswoman. ''We're waiting to see what Congress does.''
</P>
<P>
   Without permanent residency or citizenship, the Liberians must
apply for annual work permits. And many employers are reluctant to
hire workers who face possible deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband and I are not able to get jobs to use the skills we
have,'' said Mai Yuan, who has lived with her husband and three
children in Lynn, Mass. for 11 years. In Liberia, Yuan was as an
agricultural economist and her husband was an electrical engineer.
Yuan now works for the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health;
her husband works for a data processing company.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are hardworking, highly skilled people trying to support
themselves and their families and pay their taxes,'' said Sen. Jack
Reed, the Rhode Island Democrat sponsoring the permanent residency
bill in the Senate. ''They've made investments in our communities,
and we owe it to them to help them.''

<HEADLINE> Farmers Battling Grocery Fees  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To farmers like David Moore, it's bad enough
that supermarkets sell a bag of carrots or bag of potatoes for
three to four times what they're paid to grow them. Now farmers say
they're having to pay stores just to get carry their produce.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who grows oranges, vegetables and nuts near Bakersfield,
Calif., says supermarkets have charged him as much as $1,000 a week
per store to display his packaged almonds.
</P>
<P>
   Growers ''are battling like never before to remain economically
viable'' and the proliferation of such fees ''is a very real
threat,'' Moore told the Senate Small Business Committee on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The fees are charged to suppliers in return for space on
supermarket shelves. They were originally charged primarily for dry
goods but now extend to products throughout the store, including
the produce section.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarket industry officials say the fees are necessary to
cover the risk of introducing new products, 90 percent of which
fail. But critics say they hurt consumers and prevent small
businesses and farmers from getting their products into stores.
</P>
<P>
   ''I may have a product that's worth nothing, but if I've got a
big checkbook I can get shelf space,'' said Sen. Conrad Burns,
R-Mont.
</P>
<P>
   A common fee quoted is $5,000 per item, per store, but it can be
as low as $10,000 per item for an entire chain, according to the
Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers say they've been thwarted in finding how
widespread the fees are because the grocery industry won't disclose
them. The committee assigned the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, to find out how much supermarket
chains were charging, but the supermarkets refused to cooperate
despite a guarantee of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chairman, Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said it
was ''highly suspicious'' that stores woudn't disclose their fees.
Suppliers are reluctant to talk about the fees for fear of being
blackballed by the stores, said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who is president of the Western Growers Association, said
stores charge the fees not just for new products, such as packaged
salads, but also for standard items, like oranges and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   One retailer asked a produce shipper to pay $30,000 for a small
sign to be placed with the commodity he was selling, Moore said. In
another case, a supermarket chain in California asked growers and
shippers to pay a ''distribution facility opening fee'' to
underwrite the cost of a new warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarket industry officials say the fees in reality help
small businesses. Otherwise, they would lose out to established
food industry giants that have ample budgets to advertise and
promote their products through coupons and other means, said Susan
Mirvis, a spokeswoman for the Food Marketing Institute, the
industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   In the produce section, the fees are levied only on brand-name
items, such as bagged salads or carrots, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who thinks there aren't enough new products or
interesting products or interesting varieties hasn't been in a
supermarket lately,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Central Park victims ask for information to help lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Eight women who say they were sexually abused in
the aftermath of the Puerto Rican Day Parade asked a judge Thursday
to order the city to give them materials that will help them
prepare lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The eight women are among the 50-plus who charged that after the
parade on June 11, young men doused them with water, stripped them,
and groped their buttocks and breasts while police refused to act
on their complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Karten, a lawyer for two of the women, said they want
police surveillance and amateur videotapes; assignment rosters,
especially for areas where the women were molested; and 911 and
radio transmission audio tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The court petition became necessary, Karten said, after city
lawyers refused to let the women's lawyers examine material they
eventually would get anyway after they file the suits against the
city and the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the city, Assistant Corporation Counsel Susan
Pondich, told State Supreme Court Justice Marcy S. Friedman that
she did not believe the women were entitled to anything before the
lawsuits were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Rubenstein, a lawyer for two other women, said, ''We
think it's unconscionable that the city is fighting us every step
of the way. Our clients cooperated with Internal Affairs, they
should cooperate with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman reserved decision on whether she would order the city
to turn over the materials. In June, she issued a temporary
restraining order barring the city from destroying the material the
women have asked for.
</P>
<P>
   Karten said lawyers hoped they would see some material from the
Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) investigation of
alleged police inaction, ''but the whole investigation by IAB has
been a whitewash.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For all intents and purposes the investigation's been
shelved,'' said Karten. ''Why are they afraid to give over
information about people who did something wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department has accused only one cop of failing to do
his job, Karten said, even though the female complainants alleged
that 20 to 30 officers had ignored them when they asked for help.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Antenen, spokesman for the Police Department, denied that
the department was being obstructionist. ''It's a matter that under
litigation,'' he said. ''There's a process for this, and it's
underway.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Thompson, spokeswoman for the Manhattan district
attorney's office, said one juvenile and 29 adults have been
charged with sex abuse, riot and robbery in connection with the
park attacks. She said 17 have been indicted, and the adult
defendants' ages range from 16 to 40.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Alter Gene in Mouse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have found a way to produce mice
with genes that can be switched on and off, a development that
could speed up the laboratory study of genes and their effect on
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a study appearing Friday in the journal Science, researchers
at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland report that they
altered a target gene in mouse embryos so that a special protein
was triggered when the mice were fed an antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
   When the mice were grown, the researchers showed that feeding
the animals an antibiotic would cause the gene to shut down. The
gene could be turned back on, the researchers said, when the
antibiotic was removed from the diet of the animals.
</P>
<P>
   John Adelman, senior author of the study, said in a statement
that being able to turn a gene on or off will give researchers ''a
clearer and more detailed insight into the specific functions of
any particular gene and its corresponding protein.''
</P>
<P>
   This, in turn, will speed the development of drugs for the
treatment of disease, he said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Faults Feds on Terror Data  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge said Thursday he is ''greatly
disappointed'' in the Treasury Department for destroying documents
sought by victims of a terrorist bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth declined to punish the
government, saying he believes the documents were destroyed
accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came in the case of Stephen Flatow, a New Jersey man
whose daughter Alisa was killed in a 1995 bombing in the Gaza
Strip. Flatow sued Iran under a 1996 anti-terrorism law that
authorized legal action against state sponsors of terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth ruled in Flatow's favor and ordered Iran to pay $247.5
million in damages. More than two years have passed, however, and
Flatow has not collected a cent. The U.S. government has opposed
his efforts to collect the judgment by laying claim to frozen
Iranian assets.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest court action, Flatow asked Lamberth to compel the
Treasury Department to produce documents on Iranian assets, as
demanded in a June 5, 1998, subpoena. The Treasury Department
objected to the subpoena as ''unduly burdensome and overly broad.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Lamberth limited the scope of the subpoena but
granted Flatow's motion to compel production of relevant documents.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also wrote that Flatow ''correctly asserts that the
Treasury Department has recently destroyed many documents covered
by the subpoena.''
</P>
<P>
   But he found that the destruction occurred ''in coordination
with an office renovation project, making it unlikely that an
underhanded scheme was afoot.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Space Station Funding Cap  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Thursday approved $28.7 billion
in spending Thursday for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. The legislation also sets a cap on development
costs for the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which passed 399-17, also moves to renegotiate
the space station agreement so that participants' benefits are more
in line with their actual contributions and so America shares less
of the future operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, chairman of the House Science
Committee, said the bill would improve management of the project,
''which will serve as the backbone of our human spaceflight program
for the next two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   He said financial support for the space agency would allow it to
''continue developing our knowledge in areas ranging from the
growth of cancer cells to the El Nino weather effect on earth and
the nature of black holes deep within our universe.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, a compromise worked out by House and Senate
negotiators, now goes back to the Senate for a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   It authorizes $14.1 billion for the space agency in fiscal year
2001 and $14.6 billion in 2002, both figures slightly above what
the administration requested.
</P>
<P>
   That includes about $4 billion over the two years for the space
station, equal to the president's request, and $6.5 billion for the
space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation caps spending on space station development at
$25 billion and limits space shuttle launch costs in connection
with the 16-nation project at $17.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But to meet administration objections that this would limit
NASA's ability to deal with unforeseen problems, lawmakers also
agreed to set up a $5 billion contingency fund for the space
station and $3.5 billion for the shuttle, to meet emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Congress acted as American and Russian crewmen from the space
shuttle Atlantis worked to install equipment on the space station
in preparation for the first permanent crew, due to arrive in
November. NASA plans eight shuttle trips to the station in the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   NASA in 1993 estimated that the space station would cost $17.4
billion to build, but now puts development costs in the $24-$26
billion range, according to a Congressional Research Service
report. Cost overruns are in part a result of Russian delays in
meeting its obligations in the project, particularly in launching a
service module.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill also removes language in the original House
bill that prohibited funding for the proposed Triana satellite
project.
</P>
<P>
   The plan inspired by Vice President Al Gore would give Americans
24-hour views of the Earth on television and the Internet. NASA and
the White have argued that the satellite would provide the
scientific community with valuable data on the Earth's climate and
solar flares.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> States Ready for Flu Vaccine Delay  </HEADLINE>
By C.G. WALLACE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Health departments across the West say
they will limit flu shots to high-risk people and take other steps
to cope with an expected shortage of the vaccine this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this
summer that shipments of the vaccine would be delayed and a
shortage was possible because manufacturers had difficulty growing
a new flu strain.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC will know by the end of the month if there will be a
national shortage, spokeswoman Charlis Thompson said. She said the
shots that are normally shipped in mid-October will be delayed
until November.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials are either giving the shots only to those at
high risk -- such as the elderly and chronically ill -- or delaying
vaccinations until later in the season. Flu season usually peaks in
February.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC recommends that people older than 65, those living in
nursing homes and those with chronic illnesses get shots first.
Priority is also recommended for health care workers, pregnant
women in their second and third trimesters and those who have
household contact with the chronically ill.
</P>
<P>
   Some health departments are delaying their vaccine season,
waiting until the shipments arrive before deciding whether to
ration the vaccine.
</P>

   Alaska's immunology program has not received any of the 85,000
doses it ordered last spring, said Laurel Wood, program manager for
the state Department of Health and Social Services.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Department of Health also is without its
vaccines, while Utah and Wyoming officials have asked that early
campaigns for the shots be suspended.

   ''You used to see people getting them (vaccinations) in grocery
stores. That won't be happening this year,'' said Jana Kettering, a
spokeswoman for the Utah Department of Health.

<HEADLINE> Probe: No Undue Influence on Army  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An investigation by three Republican-led
Senate committees found the Clinton administration has not exerted
undue influence over Army Corps of Engineers construction
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But it also deemed as unnecessary a Pentagon effort, now on
hold, to give administration officials more say over which projects
the corps pursues.
</P>
<P>
   ''After a careful evaluation of the material, we did not find
evidence of illegality, or of inappropriate political influence on
the corps' professional judgments,'' Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., said
Thursday. ''Similarly, the material provided to the committee does
not establish the need for any significant civil works management
reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's Environment and Public Works Committee, along with the
Appropriations and Armed Services committees, began the
investigation in April after Army Secretary Louis Caldera proposed
management changes intended to increase accountability at the
corps.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, long the target of environmental and taxpayer
groups, is the subject of several ongoing investigations into
allegations that top military officials rigged a case for spending
$1 billion on agribusiness-backed lock expansions on the
Mississippi and Illinois rivers.
</P>
<P>
   In his proposal, Caldera asserted that the Army's assistant
secretary for civil works was responsible for all final decisions
on projects in the corps' $4 billion flood control and river
construction portfolio. He was aiming to ensure the corps answered
to the administration instead of to its traditional allies on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairmen said Caldera's changes might allow the
Clinton administration to tamper with corps' project
recommendations to Congress for political reasons, and Caldera
withdrew his plan.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Thursday to Defense Secretary William Cohen,
the chairmen said that, based on reams of documents supplied by the
corps, they view Caldera's changes as unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   They wrote that any changes should be deferred at least until
President Clinton's nominee to be the new military commander of the
corps, Maj. Gen. Robert Flowers, is confirmed and has a chance to
settle into his post.
</P>
<P>
   An Army spokeswoman did not immediately return a call for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance before the Senate Environment panel Thursday,
Flowers said it is clear that he answers to civilian leaders at the
Army and the administration. Also during that hearing, senators
from both parties described in forceful terms their concerns about
problems at the corps.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been legitimate policy issues raised on topics like
the integrity of corps economic analyses and the future role of the
corps,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers pledged to give full attention to ''maintaining the
integrity of the Corps of Engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared receptive to a few changes long sought by
environmental groups, including a ban on projects that cause
environmental damage too costly to fix and the inclusion of those
expenses in project analyses.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives from the conservation community were
disappointed that proposals to reform the way corps projects are
reviewed and approved did not get a stronger endorsement from
Flowers or from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reform is needed to bring this out-of-control agency back in
line,'' said David Conrad, water resources specialist at the
National Wildlife Federation. ''The foxes are literally designing
the chicken coop.''

<HEADLINE> Report: State fails to follow Megan's Law when sex offenders released </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The release of a convicted rapist before
prosecutors could be told was not an accident but an example of the
state's systematic failure to keep track of sex offenders who leave
prison, according to a state Senate investigation.
</P>
<P>
   County prosecutors are routinely notified just as sex offenders
are walking out of state prisons before any Megan's Law
notifications can begin, former U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff told
a Senate committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The inmate is out the door, and the county is only able to
find out the address is phony after he's released,'' Chertoff said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary committee hired Chertoff after the
Corrections Department admitted it made numerous errors before
convicted rapist Raymond Alves was released in March.
</P>
<P>
   Now the committee will ask corrections Commissioner Jack Terhune
how long the state knew sex offenders routinely left prison with no
way for prosecutors to comply with Megan's Law, chairman Sen. Bill
Gormley, R-Atlantic, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no system. It is disjointed if not dysfunctional,''
Gormley said.
</P>
<P>
   Terhune admitted Thursday that sex offenders were released
before authorities could be notified. But he said that since the
Alves case, new safeguards are in place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some facilities were 100 percent compliant. Some were not.
We've changed that,'' Terhune said.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner, who has not seen Chertoff's report, said the
committee should look at what has happened since he ordered a
central processing system for sex offenders. Other safeguards
include multiple reviews of release dates and possible new computer
systems, Terhune said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to put some procedures in place and we've done that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alves had served less than half of a 47-year sentence for the
rape of a teen in Fair Lawn and the assault of a Clifton teen.
Prosecutors in Bergen and Passaic counties said they would have
tried to block the release had they been alerted, as state law
requires.
</P>
<P>
   Once freed, Alves took off on a 12-day cross-country bus trip
before he was arrested and charged with violating sections of
Megan's Law.
</P>
<P>
   The sex offender notification rules require convicts to provide
a valid address and to register with local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But New Jersey's prison system offers no single way to comply
with Megan's Law, Chertoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Alves episode was not a one-time accident or a problem,
but a symptom of a statewide failure of notification,'' Chertoff
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's symptomatic of the fact that what we're dealing
with is not failure at one particular institution,'' Chertoff said.
''It really is a widespread failure in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the attorney general's office, county prosecutors
detailed when and how often they were notified of prisoners'
releases. Chertoff compiled 15 months worth of figures, ending in
March.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires notification 90 days before a scheduled
release.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen and Essex counties reported being notified seven days
before or after an inmate's release, nearly as many times as they
were told before the 90-day requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Several counties maintain their own tracking system, and some
claim they are not notified before any release, Chertoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Chertoff said he found no single form or no uniform reporting
procedure for the individual state prisons to communicate with the
21 county prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ''What strikes me is in the age of computers, you would think
all this would be online,'' Chertoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley said the task now is to determine what the Corrections
Department is doing to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of dwelling on everything that might have been
wrong,'' Gormley said, ''we'll come up with a system that's right
and works.''
</P>
<P>
   Chertoff said he requested documents from Terhune's office,
including some reports of a February meeting at which the
deficiencies were discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports were not provided before Thursday's hearing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state indicated it would reply sometime this week, Gormley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Terhune would be asked to address the charges raised by Chertoff
at the next committee meeting, Gormley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have been there today if I had been asked to,''
Terhune said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 95; Nasdaq Gains 20  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chips fell sharply Thursday on
profit-taking and concerns about the drop in the euro currency, but
technology stocks moved higher for a second straight session on
upbeat speculation about corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 94.71 at 11,087.47.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index rose
19.97 to 3,913.86 but the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 4.04 to
1,480.87.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second day of a small tech-stock rally, which began
Wednesday with a 44-point gain in the Nasdaq. The index rose nearly
100 points during Thursday's trading, but couldn't hold the gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''We rallied in the morning, but the market just didn't have any
sustainability,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, an analyst with
Prudential Securities. ''The trend here in September is that there
is no trend. September has historically been a very rough month,
and it is this year, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Software maker Oracle traded up $3.13 at $84.94 on investor
anticipation of its quarterly earnings report and an upgrade to
''strong buy'' from ''outperform'' by a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
analyst. Oracle's earnings, released after the market closed, beat
Wall Street expectations by 4 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks also got a boost from Conexant Systems, which
rose $15.56 to $52.63, a nearly 42 percent increase. The company
announced late Wednesday it was spinning its Internet
infrastructure business off into a separate company.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase rose $2.13 to $106.94, ending a slide that started
at the beginning of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems spent most of the day up, but closed down 6 cents
at $61.25. Intel also briefly rallied before falling $1.63 to
$59.63.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq is playing a little catch-up because they had a
serious setback of underperfomance as we got into September,'' said
Ronald J. Hill, an investment strategist and partner at Brown
Brothers Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, blue chips slumped on worries that a drop in the
euro, Europe's currency, will hurt corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest U.S. companies are scheduled to report earnings in
the next four weeks. Investor uncertainty about how strong those
profits will be has left many unwilling to make large commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Colgate-Palmolive fell $8.81 to $47.38, a 15 percent drop, after
a Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown analyst downgraded the stock, citing
the influence of the weak euro and higher fuel costs. Later in the
day, the company issued a statement saying it was comfortable with
third-quarter earnings estimates, but offered no other specifics.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's also fell, declining $1.06 to $26.94, after it warned
late Wednesday that the euro's fall would hurt its bottom line.
Several analysts lowered their earnings estimates for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, Wall Street got a lift from the Labor
Department's report that wholesale prices fell an unexpected 0.2
percent last month, the first drop in four months. The decline
followed a flat reading in the Producer Price Index in July.
</P>
<P>
   The report was further evidence that the economy is slowing and
reassured investors that the inflation-wary Fed is unlikely to
raise rates for a seventh time since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some good data today for the soft-landing scenario, but
obviously there is still not enough confidence overall to get
things totally on track,'' said Hill, the analyst with Brown
Brothers Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.21 billion
shares, less than the 1.29 billion shares Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 5.21 to 539.21.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was up 0.14 percent.
Germany's DAX index rose 0.60 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
1.19 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.05 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 100 Said Killed in Congo  </HEADLINE>
By ARNAUD ZAJTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- A pro-government militia said Thursday
that it had killed nearly 100 Rwandan soldiers and six white
mercenaries in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The claim from the Mai-Mai militia came a day after a rebel
leader declared an offensive on the militia, after the Mai-Mai
group killed 15 civilians in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Mai-Mai leader Gen. Padiri Kalendo, read on
state television, said his forces killed 93 Rwandans and six
mercenaries in the village of Nyanga Walikale, about 60 miles east
of the eastern Congolese city of Goma.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting occurred Sept. 4-8, after Rwandan soldiers attacked
a Mai-Mai stronghold in an attempt to capture Kalendo.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said hundreds of Congolese civilians were injured
during the fighting and that 41 fleeing civilians were killed by
Rwandan soldiers in the nearby village of Malembe.
</P>
<P>
   The Mai-Mai have been fighting in eastern Congo since 1960, when
Congo achieved independence from Belgium. They are known for their
belief in magical charms that they feel protect them in battle.
They have become an increasingly potent force in that part of the
country during the two-year civil war to unseat President Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   A top Congolese military commander said government officials are
in close contact with the Mai-Mai, who control a number of villages
in eastern Congo from which they launch attacks on the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Moise Nyarugabo, a leader of the Rwandan-backed
Congolese Rally for Democracy, the rebel group that controls much
of eastern Congo, said rebel troops battled for five hours with the
well-armed Mai-Mai attackers after a truck ambush along the road to
Kamanyola, 20 miles north of Uvira in South Kivu province.
</P>
<P>
   The Mai-Mai fighters, drawn from several tribes in eastern
Congo, attacked the minibus outside Uvira on Tuesday, killing 14
passengers and wounding another six, Nyarugabo said.
</P>
<P>
   Most roads have become too dangerous to travel in eastern Congo
where the Mai-Mai often fight alongside bands of Rwandan and
Burundian Hutu rebels fighting to oust their respective
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda back the three rebel groups that are fighting
to oust Kabila. Burundi also has troops in eastern Congo in pursuit
of Burundian Hutu rebels. Rwanda accuses Kabila of failing to rid
Congo of at least 10,000 Rwandan Hutu militiamen who fled there
after participating in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda in which at
least 500,000 were slaughtered on the orders of an extremist Hutu
government.

<HEADLINE> Former security guard pleads guilty to cover-up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A former Trump Plaza Hotel &AMP; Casino
guard who covered up the beating death of a rowdy gambler has
pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Waldron, 51, of Egg Harbor Township, who was originally
charged with witness tampering, pleaded guilty to providing a
fictitious report on Monday. She was sentenced to one year of
probation.
</P>
<P>
   The case stemmed from the Sept. 8, 1998, death of Hue Q. To, 25,
of Plainfield, who was ejected from the casino for panhandling,
trying to steal chips from other gamblers and threatening to kill
guards.
</P>
<P>
   To died of a spinal injury after a scuffle in a Trump Plaza
security office. Another former guard, Mark Petty, 37, of Galloway
Township, was convicted last month of second-degree manslaughter in
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Waldron allegedly threatened four guards, warning them not to
tell the truth about what happened because it would send Petty to
jail and result in their firings.
</P>
<P>
   Waldron, who lost her job as a result of the incident and now
drives a bus, pleaded guilty rather than go to trial. She admitted
making false statements in reports to the state Division of Gaming
Enforcement about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we were confident with respect to a trial, whenever
there's a jury, there's always a degree of uncertainty and there's
always a risk,'' said Peter Bruso, her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Petty is to be sentenced Sept. 21.

<HEADLINE> More test samples show cholera in Ocean City lagoon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - A new round of tests in the
cholera-tainted waters of a lagoon have confirmed the presence of
the bacteria, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine new samples taken in the lagoon at 17th Street all came up
positive for Vibrio cholera non-01, one of 139 different strains of
the intestinal disease.
</P>
<P>
   One was sent to the federal Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta for further testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've pretty much established it's there in the waters,'' said
Louis Lamanna, director of the Cape May County Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Vibrio cholera, common in warm brackish water, is not associated
with the cholera epidemics experienced in developing Third World
nations, health officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of tests was performed after an unidentified
30-year-old Ocean City man was treated for cholera last month. He
was hospitalized but survived.
</P>
<P>
   The man told officials he swam in the lagoon with his dog, but
he also said he ate undercooked softshell crabs and raw clams
shortly before being stricken.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Lamanna said, authorities may never determine where
he contracted the sickness. Still, they plan to examine storm
drains, sewage outfall pipes and boats to find out where the
cholera came from, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming and fishing have been banned in the area since the
discovery.

<HEADLINE> Man charged with strangling 18-year-old census enumerator  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) - A Piscataway man has been charged with
strangling an 18-year-old man who worked for two weeks as a U.S.
Census Bureau worker in Newark, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Stewart's mother reported him missing on May 31, three days
after he disappeared from his Newark home, authorities said. His
body was found in June in a drainage ditch in Piscataway, but was
not positively identified until Wednesday, investigators told the
Home News and Tribune of East Brunswick in Thursday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Rashid A. Peterson-Gaines was arrested Monday in the parking lot
of Piscataway's municipal court and charged with Stewart's slaying,
authorities said. He had gone to court for a hearing on minor
traffic violations and had showed up on the wrong day, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's girlfriend had told authorities that she saw the two
men together in Newark sometime before May 26, Middlesex County
Prosecutor Glenn Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart worked for the U.S. Census Bureau as an enumerator in
his neighborhood for two weeks in May, said Ligia Jaquez, assistant
regional census manager at the Census' regional center in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart wanted to save money to buy clothes for his senior prom,
Jaquez said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a good worker for us. Good kid,'' Jaquez said.
</P>
<P>
   Jaquez said Stewart's crew leader last heard from him on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson-Gaines entered a not guilty plea to murder Thursday and
was held on $300,000 bail.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court: Nigerian human rights abuses can be heard in U.S. court </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A lawsuit charging that the Royal Dutch
Petroleum Co. assisted in the torture and murder of Nigerian
activists can be heard in federal court in New York rather than
England, an appeals court ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
was praised by lawyers for four plaintiffs, including one who now
lives in the United States, two others living in Canada and a woman
living in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   A message left with lawyers for the defendants, Royal Dutch
Petroleum Co., incorporated in the Netherlands, and Shell Transport
and Trading Co., incorporated in Great Britain, was not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies jointly control and operate the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group, a vast international network of affiliated but
formally independent oil and gas companies, according to the ruling
written by Judge Pierre N. Leval.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs alleged in a lawsuit in federal court in
Manhattan that one of the affiliated companies, Shell Petroleum
Development Co. of Nigeria Limited, coercively took land for oil
development without adequate compensation and polluted air and
water in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   They said Shell Nigeria recruited the Nigerian police and
military to attack local villages and suppress the organized
opposition to its development projects.
</P>
<P>
   One plaintiff sued on behalf of his father and another on behalf
of her husband after both men were hanged, along with Ogoni
leaders, in 1995 after being convicted of murder by a special
military tribunal on charges that the lawsuit alleged were based on
fabricated evidence. Another plaintiff alleged he was illegally
detained by Nigerian authorities while a fourth said she was beaten
and shot by the Nigerian military in a raid on her village.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Brown Chomsky, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, called
the ruling a ''significant victory.''
</P>
<P>
   It reversed a decision by U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in
Manhattan that concluded the case should be tried in England.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court found that Wood failed to properly consider
the importance of letting a U.S. resident choose where the trial
occurs and the interests of the United States in litigating claims
of violations of international standards of human rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court praised British courts but said the defendants
had failed to prove that ''pertinent factors tilt sufficiently
strongly in favor of trial in the foreign forum.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the 2nd Circuit said the companies should be
subject to a U.S.-based trial because they maintain an Investor
Relations Office in New York City at an annual cost of more than a
half-million dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
   Chomsky said the ruling means that multinational corporations
who gain money from trading in U.S. markets ''won't be able to
pretend that they're not here.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Corporations can be held liable when they join forces with
authoritarian dictatorships that abuse their own population,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer M. Green, another lawyer who worked on the case, said
the ruling will mean corporations ''can't do business here and then
evade accountability for human rights violations.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Committee OKs Hawaiian Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A controversial measure granting federal
recognition to Native Hawaiians was approved by a Senate committee
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the right thing to do,'' said Sen. Daniel Inouye,
Hawaii's Democratic senator and vice chairman of the Indian Affairs
Committee, which passed the measure by a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation sponsored by Sen. Daniel Akaka will affect the
state's 200,000 Native Hawaiians and essentially define the
political status of those descended from the islands' original
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   It suggests Congress create a framework for recognizing a
''government-to-government'' relationship with a Native Hawaiian
governing body similar to the relationships enjoyed by 556
federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote follows a week of raucous hearings in Hawaii
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Some Native Hawaiians who oppose the measure say it gives the
federal government too much of a role in the Hawaiian sovereignty
process. Many of those critics also advocate Hawaii's secession
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also faces an uphill battle in Congress. Sen. Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., said Thursday he still has concerns about how the
bill would affect Indian programs. ''I clearly would not like to
bring a very large number of new people within the gamut of Indian
Affairs,'' Domenici said at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters tried to assure him the Native Hawaiians would not
become a part of Indian programs. ''This bill does not make them an
Indian tribe. All this bill does is begin the process of the
government recognizing Native Hawaiians,'' said Inouye.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Rep. Patsy Mink, a member of Hawaii's all Democratic
delegation, has so far declined to sign on as a cosponsor of the
House version sponsored by Rep. Neil Abercrombie, also of Hawaii.
She has suggested the bill be changed to include a referendum among
Hawaiians on what form of self-governance they want before pursing
federal recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the bill's struggle is Congress' plans to adjourn in
the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The bills were offered after the U.S. Supreme Court's Feb. 23
ruling striking down the state's Hawaiians-only restriction for
voting in Office of Hawaiian Affairs elections as unconstitutional
racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaiian leaders fear that ruling could be the basis for future
court rulings dismantling more than 180 federal and state programs
benefitting Hawaiians.

<HEADLINE> Judge 'greatly disappointed' in destruction of documents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - A federal judge said Thursday he is ''greatly
disappointed'' in the U.S. Treasury Department for destroying
documents sought by victims of a terrorist bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge, Royce C. Lamberth of U.S. District Court,
declined to impose sanctions on the government, saying he believes
the documents were destroyed accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came in the case of Stephen Flatow of West Orange,
N.J., whose daughter Alisa was killed in a 1995 bombing in the Gaza
Strip. Flatow sued Iran under a 1996 anti-terrorism law that
authorized legal action against state sponsors of terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth ruled in Flatow's favor and ordered Iran to pay $247.5
million in damages. More than two years have passed, however, and
Flatow has not collected a cent. The U.S. government has opposed
his efforts to collect the judgment by laying claim to frozen
Iranian assets.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest court action, Flatow asked Lamberth to compel the
Treasury Department to produce documents on Iranian assets, as
demanded in a June 5, 1998, subpoena. The Treasury Department
objected to the subpoena as ''unduly burdensome and overly broad.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Lamberth limited the scope of the subpoena but
granted Flatow's motion to compel production of relevant documents.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also wrote that Flatow ''correctly asserts that the
Treasury Department has recently destroyed many documents covered
by the subpoena.''
</P>
<P>
   But he found that the destruction occurred ''in coordination
with an office renovation project, making it unlikely that an
underhanded scheme was afoot.''

<HEADLINE> Niagara Falls, N.Y., eyes future after casino opens in Canada  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - An expanded billion dollar casino on
the Canadian side of the Niagara River could pull its American
neighbor out of the doldrums or push it further into despair,
supporters and critics argue.
</P>
<P>
   Open since 1996, the expanded Casino Niagara includes a 368-room
Hyatt Hotel where each room has a view of the falls. It will
feature a nearly 55,000-square-foot gaming area, a 1,500-seat
theater, shopping areas, restaurants and a 3,000-car parking
garage.
</P>
<P>
   It should generate 12,000 full- and part-time jobs for the
Niagara region, including 5,000 jobs at the casino itself. It is
tentatively expected to open in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''The casino is a tremendous opportunity for Niagara Falls,
N.Y., and Buffalo, but private developers in both cities need to
build attractions that would tap into the tourist trade,'' Buffalo
developer Paul L. Snyder, a member of the American-Canadian
consortium building the new casino, told the Buffalo Evening News.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, though, worry that a casino across the border will draw
tourists away from the U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be devastating for hotels in Niagara Falls,
N.Y., and for the city itself,'' said state Sen. Alfred Coppola, a
Buffalo Democrat whose district includes Niagara Falls. ''As the
vacancy rate climbs, the assessment of the hotels will go down and
the bottom will drop out of the tax base.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola said the answer is for Niagara Falls, N.Y., to build its
own casino to take advantage of the $40 million that goes to Casino
Niagara every month. He is pushing to for a November referendum
asking New Yorkers if they want casino gambling.

<HEADLINE> Schools closed again in Hamilton Township  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAMILTON, N.J. (AP) - Striking teachers and school district
employees in Hamilton Township were not expected to receive
paychecks Friday.
</P>
<P>
   School board lawyer Dennis DeSantis said in a letter to the
Hamilton Township Education Association and the Hamilton Township
School Secretaries Association that striking employees are not due
any money.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be no direct deposit or checks distributed to your
affected members on Friday, September 15,'' DeSantis wrote.
''Payroll will be adjusted and checks will be distributed to
reflect earnings due minus deductions following the job action.''
</P>
<P>
   DeSantis did not return phone calls and messages Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Joseph, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Education
Association, said teachers and other school employees should get
paychecks for days they worked preparing for the start of classes
on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said teachers worked Sept. 5 while the custodial staff,
food service workers and secretaries worked for several days or
even weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real point is that they are due some money,'' Joseph said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for the teachers and the Hamilton Township school
board were expected to meet at 6 p.m. Thursday for the fifth
consecutive night of contract talks. The teachers union was not
expected to hold a general membership meeting early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Striking teachers and school officials remained at odds over
salary issues Thursday, but some progress was reported in contract
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said talks ended early Thursday morning without a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was some movement on some other issues, but not on
salary,'' Joseph said.
</P>
<P>
   Classes were canceled again Thursday, the seventh day schools
have been closed since the strike began last week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 1,100 teachers are defying a back-to-work order
issued last week by Superior Court Judge Anthony J. Parrillo. The
judge has ordered $300 fines to teachers for every day of missed
work. The union must pay a $100,000-a-day fine.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 400 school secretaries, electricians, plumbers and other
skilled workers, who have a valid contract but are supporting the
strike, must pay a $50-a-day fine.
</P>
<P>
   School board officials have said fines would be deducted from
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers union lawyer Arnold Mellk said the district can not
collect the fines from the union or the teachers until the court
holds a hearing on whether they are financially able to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Parrillo has yet to schedule another hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Times of Trenton reported in Thursday's editions that
DeSantis' wife - a teacher and member of the striking association
recovering at home from recent surgery - would not be fined.
</P>
<P>
   DeSantis told the Times that employees who have a ''legitimate
reason'' for not being at school as well as those who crossed the
picket lines to return to work would be exempt from paying the
fines.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker hopes bill would allow towns to ban smoking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A state senator from Mercer County claims a
new bill will close a loophole she says allowed a judge to dismiss
Princeton's attempt to severely limit smoking in public.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Shirley Turner, D-Mercer, introduced a bill Thursday to
provide legal protection to towns that propose anti-smoking
measures.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give authority to municipalities, local health
commissions and other boards to adopt such ordinances.
</P>
<P>
   ''Individual communities should have the authority to protect
public health through the establishment of smoking bans,'' Turner
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's bill also allows ordinances to apply to small
businesses, retail and food stores and bars.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill can provide sound legal protection for towns seeking
to crack down on smoking,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Princeton Regional Health Commission passed its ban in
June, it appeared to be the strictest anti-smoking ordinance in the
state, prohibiting lighting up in bars, restaurants and workplaces.
It restricted smoking to homes, cigar shops or outdoors. Violators
faced fines from $100 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia-based National Smokers Alliance and three Princeton
bars and restaurants filed a lawsuit challenging the ban June 8.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Linda R. Feinberg sided with them on Aug.
29.
</P>
<P>
   In the 64-page ruling, Feinberg agreed with the alliance's
arguments that the health commission did not have the authority to
enact the ban for fire-safety purposes. The judge also held that
the ordinance is pre-empted by state law.

<HEADLINE> Teachers walk out again in Buffalo strike  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Striking Buffalo teachers said they would
be back in class Friday after an angry Supreme Court judge ordered
an end to the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Teachers Federation President Philip Rumore said
teachers would honor a request by a state mediator to return to
class for at least the next three school days while contract
negotiations continue.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore and other union executives got a legal break Thursday
when Justice Kevin Dillon threw out contempt charges against them
on a technicality. New charges, however, are likely because the
strike violates the state's Taylor Law and a temporary restraining
order signed by Dillon at the district's request.
</P>
<P>
   After suspending their strike all week, the BTF's 3,700 teachers
unexpectedly resumed the walkout at 7:05 a.m. Thursday, stranding
thousands of schoolchildren at bus stops and on schoolbuses.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Marion Canedo canceled classes in the district of
47,000 and the city opened emergency shelters for children. Bus
drivers ran their routes to tell parents of the closing. Children
left unattended were picked up and cared for until parents could be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the city, as teachers picketed, children wearing
backpacks walked along streets, with and without adults.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the absolute life of me, I cannot comprehend any reason
whatsoever why someone would conclude that harm from the actions of
this morning would fall on anyone other than the children of the
city of Buffalo,'' Dillon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about the greedy self-interest of the executive
committee of the Buffalo Teachers Federation who have no interest
in protecting the health, safety and welfare of our children,''
said Board of Education President Paul Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore led teachers in a noontime rally on the steps of City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The union claims the district has not bargained in good faith to
replace a contract that expired in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''The district reneged and actually decreased the offers that
the superintendent and chief negotiator agreed upon previously,''
the union said in a prepared statement. ''It is apparent that the
superintendent and chief negotiator do not have the authority to
negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said the district's latest offer Wednesday contained
raises of 16.5 percent over four years. The union, he said, is
seeking 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, Dillon gave the teachers a pass for their
walkout last Thursday, dismissing contempt charges filed against
union leaders. He agreed with BTF lawyers who argued that paperwork
related to a court order forbidding the strike had been improperly
filed.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, however, solidified a temporary restraining order
issued Tuesday ordering teachers back to work.
</P>
<P>
   BTF attorney Michael Sawicki said he expected the city to file
new contempt charges stemming from the latest walkout.
</P>
<P>
   After reporting for the first day of school last Wednesday,
teachers went on strike an hour before classes began the following
day. With word of progress in contract talks, the teachers
suspended their strike and had reported to work every day since.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like it,'' said Alisha Bly, 10, of Buffalo as she
walked home with her three siblings and her father. ''I think the
teachers should get what they want instead of the board cheating
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Stephany, the mother of a fifth-grader, said the strike has
interfered with her search for a new job.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so nerve-racking, not knowing if there's going to be
school or not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her 10-year-old son, Steven Smodics, took advantage of
the free time to meet U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton,
who was making a campaign stop in their Buffalo neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who was endorsed by the Buffalo teachers union,
condemned the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really believe strongly that we do have to give more support
to our teachers, both in terms of financial support, but also
respect and authority and discipline, the things that make our
schools successful,'' Clinton said. ''But there has to be a
recognition that the most important obligation is to be in that
classroom teaching our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Picketing teachers said they would stand together.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd all rather be in the classroom. But we also want to get
what we deserve and what the kids deserve,'' said special education
teacher Ros Gottstein said as she picketed outside South Park High
School.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Case To Tackle Violence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three days after a federal report said the
entertainment industry aggressively markets violent, adult-rated
products to young people, President Clinton pushed the industry to
get more involved in tackling youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   The president's words were echoed by America Online Chairman
Steve Case at a luncheon Thursday hosted by the National Campaign
Against Youth Violence, established at a White House summit in 1999
by U.S. business and political leaders. Case, who serves on the
campaign committee, pledged to do more considering his company's
proposed merger with entertainment giant Time-Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the FTC's report reminded us this week, we have a lot more
work to do, especially those of us in the media and
communications-entertainment industries,'' Case said. ''I'm
certainly looking forward to working with other leaders in what
will soon be my new industry: to take a fresh look at what's being
done and to make a commitment to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that would include re-evaluating marketing practices to
restrict children's access to violent and content inappropriate for
young people as well as helping to give parents the tools they need
to determine what movies and music and World Wide Web sites their
kids should or shouldn't be seeing.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report said that even movies rated R, which require an
adult to accompany children under 17, and video games that carry an
M rating for 17 and over are routinely marketed toward younger
people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton highlighted some progress in the campaign against youth
violence: content rating systems for television and video games,
parental controls for the Internet and V-chips that let parents
control what their children watch on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it is unrealistic to expect that we can get where we need
to go if the major entertainment media are not involved,'' Clinton
said. ''They have to buy onto this. And they have to understand
that in the end, the most successful companies have a big interest
in living in a safe society, and a good society.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs 2 More Spending Bills  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans ignored a White House veto threat
and muscled two spending bills through the House on Thursday, even
as their election-season drive to use 90 percent of next year's
surplus for debt reduction put Democrats momentarily on the
defensive.
</P>
<P>
   With the Oct. 1 start of fiscal 2001 drawing ever closer, the
House approved a $414 million measure financing the District of
Columbia's government. The vote was 217-207.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, they voted 212-209 for a second bill
providing $30.3 billion for Congress' own operations, the Treasury
Department and smaller agencies. The measure would also phase out
the 3 percent federal excise tax on telephone service over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Both votes were nearly party-line, with Republicans saying they
had failed to work out compromises with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're on the move here,'' said House Appropriations Committee
Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But with 11 of the 13 annual spending bills for the coming
fiscal year still incomplete -- including eight that face Clinton
administration veto threats -- Congress has a long way to go before
lawmakers can go home for the presidential and congressional
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained about both measures the House approved
Thursday, though only the Treasury-legislative measure faced a veto
threat by President Clinton. They complained about shortfalls for
student aid and an environmental cleanup in the District of
Columbia, and cuts in Clinton requests for the Internal Revenue
Service and counterterrorism programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In essence, this dog has three tails and no legs,'' Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis., said of the measure for the Treasury, Congress and
the telephone tax. ''It isn't going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the House Ways and Means Committee voted 33-0 to
create a process for using all but about $27 billion of next year's
projected $268 billion projected budget surplus for reducing the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, all of the Social Security and Medicare
surpluses -- plus most of the rest of next year's budget surplus --
would be directed to debt reduction. It would take 60 votes in the
100-member Senate to do otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The bill reflected the GOP's newest goal: reserving 90 percent
of next year's projected federal surplus to reduce the national
debt. Unable to force their biggest tax cuts into law over Clinton
vetoes, Republicans hope their new drive will help them grab credit
for debt reduction, which is popular with the public, and limit
Clinton's efforts to use the money to boost spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't allow the president to squander the surplus on big
government spending,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they scoffed at the measure, all of the Ways and Means
Committee's Democrats who were present voted for the bill,
underlining the political appeal of debt reduction. And they said
they would do the same thing next week in the full House.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all going to vote for this thing because it's like a lot
of nice-sounding press releases, a nice thing to say,'' said Rep.
Robert Matsui, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats insisted that when it came to making actual
decisions about taxes and spending, the $27 billion the GOP would
use for spending and tax cuts would not be enough, even for
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   They cited both parties' desires to cut taxes for telephone
users, students, inner cities and some small businesses and to
boost spending for schools, hospitals and nursing homes, fighting
forest fires, defense and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also argued that the new GOP goal was an abrupt
abandonment of the Republicans' push for big tax cuts, and of GOP
presidential candidate George W. Bush's call for a 10-year, $1.3
trillion tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, with their 90-10 debt reduction plan, Republicans have
essentially repudiated their own agenda, which they have pursued
vigorously for the last six years,'' said House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Klain, adviser to Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
presidential candidate, said the GOP debt-reduction plan meant that
''Republicans effectively declared their nominee's budget dead on
arrival even before it's clear whether he'll be given an
opportunity to submit a budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the congressional GOP's plan
is ''very understandable'' because given Clinton's tax-bill vetoes,
it was needed to keep Clinton from a ''spending spree.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as House Democrats ridiculed the GOP debt-reduction
plan, they cited it as a reason to oppose the elimination of the
telephone tax right now. They said that if only 10 percent of the
surplus is to be used for spending and tax cuts, all tax-cutting
ideas should be considered before even a popular one like the
telephone tax is enacted.

<HEADLINE> High-tech firms show their wares  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTHINGTON, Conn. (AP) - Innovations in fields ranging from
solar power to pharmaceuticals went on display Thursday as
Connecticut's high-tech companies got together for technology
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering of 45 firms was designed to help companies
publicize their products, expose them to potential investors, and
perhaps find other firms who sell complementary products and
services.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great networking,'' said Andrew Marsh, president of
newly-formed Solar Dynamics in Avon. The company sells solar power
cells in isolated areas not wired for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   For Eric Stobin, a sales representative from Wilton-based
Spinergy Inc., it was a chance to meet people in other fields than
his own. His company makes lightweight, high-performance wheels for
high-end bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to partner up with companies that are outside the
industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 800 visitors strolled past booths bathed in subdued
lighting on posh carpets at the upscale Aqua Turf Club, some
looking for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Dowd, manager for process at CiDRA Corp., which makes
fiber-optic components, said his company started with one employee
in 1996 and now employes 256 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We probably need another 200 by next summer,'' Dowd said,
moments after snagging a resume from a visitor at his booth.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Innovations sponsored the exhibition. The Rocky Hill
organization received state funding in 1989 to invest in
Connecticut's budding technology firms and share in the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Brandyberry, the group's executive vice president, said
the investments have paid off. The organization has been
self-sustaining for five years, and invested a record $31 million
in emerging Connecticut high-tech companies last year.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that have received investment capital from
Connecticut Innovations now employ 2,100 and generate more than
$315 milllion yearly in sales, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a vibrant technology economy in Connecticut,'' said
Brandyberry.

	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey Lottery officials said 4,600 of
its 6,000 ticket terminals were disabled Thursday due to a problem

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supreme Court denies two requests for stay for Barnabei  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BASKERVILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JARRATT, Va. (AP) - Derek R. Barnabei awaited execution Thursday
night for raping and murdering a teen-age girl in 1993 after the
U.S. Supreme Court twice refused to grant a stay.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei, 33, who is a native of Somers Point, N.J., was to get
a lethal injection at the Greensville Correctional Center for the
rape and murder of Sarah J. Wisnosky, a 17-year-old Old Dominion
University freshman he had been dating.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei repeatedly said he was innocent and the case was
closely followed in Italy because he is Italian-American and that
country opposes the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to die and it's unjust that I die. If this is
what God wants, then so be it. I accept it. Who am I to question
the ultimate design?'' he said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei's spiritual adviser, the Rev. Bob West, met with
Barnabei for about 90 minutes Thursday and said the condemned man
was ''ready to die.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's at peace, in great spirits,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Barnabei, Derek Barnabei's brother, described him as
''remarkably calm and at peace with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   At a final family meeting at the prison, Barnabei told his
brother and mother Jane to ''to go on with our lives and fight,''
Craig Barnabei said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope this is not for nothing,'' Craig Barnabei quoted his
brother as saying. ''I hope people take a hard look at my case.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei also wanted his body cremated, but his mother talked
him out of it, his brother said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei's lawyer filed a clemency petition with Gov. Jim
Gilmore, even though the governor had said Monday that he would not
grant clemency because new DNA testing confirmed Barnabei was
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Serious doubts still surround this case,'' the lawyer, Seth A.
Tucker, said in the petition filed Wednesday. He argued that
Barnabei should not be executed while a state police investigation
continues into a temporary disappearance of evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would do a disservice not only to Derek Barnabei, but also
to the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia, to continue with an
execution when there is still no conclusion as to who moved the
evidence, what they did with it, and why,'' Tucker wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore said Thursday that he is sure nobody tampered with the
evidence that was tested - Wisnosky's fingernail clippings, which
were in a sealed envelope that had not been opened.
</P>
<P>
   He also said plenty of other evidence was considered at trial
and in Barnabei's appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't retry cases in the governor's office,'' Gilmore told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's denial of two stay requests followed rulings
against Barnabei by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and U.S.
District Judge James Spencer in Richmond. The courts dismissed
defense arguments that the state tampered with evidence and that
more DNA testing should be done because some evidence disappeared
from Aug. 29 to Sept. 1 at the Norfolk Circuit Court clerk's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei had asked for DNA tests on some of that evidence -
genetic material on Wisnosky's fingernail clippings - in effort to
prove someone else committed the crime. Instead, the DNA tests
matched Barnabei.
</P>
<P>
   Wisnosky was last seen alive in Barnabei's room in a house he
shared with other young men in Norfolk. Her nude and beaten body
was found floating in the Lafayette River.

<HEADLINE> Immigration judge: Ex-Marine can stay in the country because of war record </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - An immigrant from the Dominican Republic who
fought in Vietnam, but faced deportation because of a drug
conviction should be allowed to stay in America because of his war
record, an immigration judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Victoria Ghartey signed the ruling in Manhattan Monday,
terminating deportation proceedings against Luis Perez-Portes, a
54-year-old Queens resident.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't think of an individual more American, more proud of
his country, than Mr. Perez-Portes,'' said his lawyer, Ismael
Gonzalez. ''He was overjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling clears the way for Perez-Portes to pursue his
application to become a citizen of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A message left with the Immigration and Naturalization Service
office seeking comment was not immediately returned. Gonzalez,
however, said he had been told that the INS planned to appeal the
case to the Board of Immigration Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Perez-Portes was convicted May 24, 1996 in U.S. District Court
in West Virginia for possession with intent to distribute cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to two years in prison for the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Perez-Portes came to the United States at age 9, and joined the
U.S. Marine Corps in 1964 after completing the 10th grade. He was
sent to Vietnam, where he served for almost two years. While there
he was decorated and promoted to corporal. He was honorably
discharged and settled back in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Marines, he worked as a laborer and farmer in
New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and raised four children
with his wife, a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said Perez-Portes is eligible to remain in the United
States because of a provision of federal law allowing citizenship
for an alien who has served honorably at any time in the armed
forces for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The judge concluded that the provision could act as an exception
to good moral character and residency requirements for
naturalization.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also said Perez-Portes suffers from a life-threatening
medical condition after suffering a heart attack in 1988 and is
plagued by gland tumors, severe hypertension and Conn's Syndrome, a
condition requiring drugs that might be unavailable in the
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said he was ''very pleased that justice was done here,
particularly for a former Marine who received a medal for battling
in the front lines in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He volunteered for the Marine Corps back at a time when many
U.S. citizens attempted to avoid the draft and flee to Canada. As
far as I'm concerned, he's more American than a lot of Americans
were,'' Gonzalez said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors decide not to seek death penalty in wedding shooting case </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - Bergen County prosecutors said Thursday
they will not seek the death penalty in the case of a New Jersey
businessman accused of killing his ex-girlfriend on the day she was
to marry another man.
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Schwanwede, first assistant Bergen County prosecutor,
told Superior Court Judge William C. Meehan he would file a motion
challenging Agustin Garcia's right to pose a passion-provocation
defense to the Sept. 26, 1999, shooting of Gladys Ricart.
</P>
<P>
   The motion will ask ''whether Garcia is entitled as a matter of
law'' to such a defense, Schwanwede said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 47, of North Bergen, entered innocent pleas Thursday to
charges of murder, weapons offenses and four counts of child
endangerment in the Ricart slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Ricart, 39, was posing for photographs with her bridal party in
her Ridgefield home before her wedding to James Preston Jr. when,
witnesses say, Garcia burst in, pulled a .38-caliber revolver out
of his briefcase and fired five shots at her.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's lawyers have said they are seriously considering a
heat-of-passion defense, contending that Garcia, who headed several
nonprofit organizations in New York City, believed he and Ricart
were still in a romance until the day of her wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is that this is a passion case,'' said Garcia's
brother, Jose Garcia, outside Bergen County Superior Court on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers presented a videotape of Garcia and Ricart
together in a store about 12 hours before her wedding at a recent
news conference, which prompted prosecutors to obtain a gag order
prohibiting all attorneys in the case from speaking with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and Ricart family members have said that Ricart ended
her relationship with Garcia about nine months before the shooting
and that Garcia was stalking her.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Edward Jerejian said attorneys would soon file
motions seeking to suppress a statement Garcia made to police and
other evidence including telephone records and items seized from
his briefcase at the time of his arrest.

<HEADLINE> Hungry Threaten Chimps in Uganda  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Hungry refugees displaced by the two-year
civil war in neighboring Congo, and forced to eat small apes,
threaten to wipe out the chimpanzee population in western Uganda, a
conservationist said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm Moeller, a consultant with the Uganda Wildlife Education
Center, said Ugandans do not customarily eat members of the ape
family. But he said the practice is spreading with the arrival of
large numbers of Congolese refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no evidence that poaching for chimp meat has been
going on in Uganda for a long time. It has never happened before
that chimpanzees and gorillas are consumed in Uganda, and I'm
afraid this is spreading here,'' Moeller told The Associated Press
from his office in Entebbe, south of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of Congolese are in many parts of western Uganda, and
many are not in refugee camps but in areas that are chimpanzee
habitats... There is fear that poaching is increasing as people
hunt the primates and sell the meat to the refugees, and we fear
that this primate meat-eating habit might spread to Uganda,''
Moeller said.
</P>
<P>
   He was reacting to an article Thursday in the government-owned
daily New Vision that reported the threat to Ugandan chimpanzees
from the Congolese refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very serious. We are investigating these new
threats,'' the daily quoted Tourism Minister Moses Ali as saying.
</P>
<P>
   In April, an international conservation conference in Uganda
observed that the 150,000 chimpanzees in Africa that make up 98
percent of the total world population, are increasingly threatened
by poaching, human encroachment and hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two men were arrested near the western Ugandan town
of Kasese with chimpanzee meat. They were tried, convicted and
sentenced to 18 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The chimpanzee population in Uganda is estimated at around 3,000
animals in the forests and bush along the border with the Congo.
The government runs a sanctuary that currently houses 27 chimps
rescued from poachers.
</P>
<P>
   Meat from monkeys, chimpanzees and other small apes is a
significant part of the diet of people in the two Congos, the
Central African Republic, Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea.

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Barnabei Vigils,550 	   Protesters rail against death penalty at vigils </HEADLINE>
By MARIA SANMINIATELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   JARRATT, Va. (AP) - Death penalty opponents said Derek R.
Barnabei was being put to death Thursday night for political gain
and that executions of criminals are themselves crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a human sacrifice, not for the sake of justice, but
for the sake of political gain,'' said Oliviero Toscani, an
official of Talk magazine in New York. ''Whoever has more condemned
inmates has more votes.''
</P>
<P>
   At dusk, protesters began trickling to the gate outside the
Greensville Correctional Center where Barnabei was scheduled to die
by injection at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Vigils were held around the state Thursday as the execution hour
approached.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day in Charlottesville, protesters railed against
the cruelty of capital punishment and promised Gov. Jim Gilmore
they would not go away.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is America. We're supposed to be civilized. That's not
what I see,'' Ida Reid of Charlottesville told about 30 protesters
outside the local circuit court building.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said her brother, James Reid, has been brain-damaged since
a car accident 30 years ago, but he was still sent to death row for
the 1996 slaying of Annie Lester, a female acquaintance in
Montgomery County.
</P>
<P>
   Holding signs that bore slogans such as ''Life is sacred. Do not
kill,'' and ''An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind,'' some
protesters said the justice system is too unreliable and capital
punishment too brutal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone can get capital punishment one day and on a different
day, judge, and jury, he's acquitted,'' said Deborah Wyatt, a trial
attorney in Charlottesville. ''There's too much fallibility in the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt thinks public opinion is moving away from the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why are the European countries so ahead of us?'' she said.
''What's wrong with us?''
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei, who was denied two stay requests by the Supreme Court
on Thursday, has denied raping and killing 17-year-old Sarah J.
Wisnosky, an Old Dominion University freshman.
</P>
<P>
   But DNA tests released Monday showed that the blood on
fingernail clippings from the victim matched Barnabei.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a federal judge denied a stay for Barnabei and
dismissed arguments by his attorneys of ''deliberate and malicious
tampering'' by the state with evidence - including Wisnosky's
fingernail clippings - that were missing for two few days before
turning up and being tested.
</P>
<P>
   The material, along with other forensic evidence, disappeared
from a secure holding area in the Norfolk Circuit Court Clerk's
office late last month. After it was found in the office, Gov. Jim
Gilmore ordered an investigation into the disappearance. The
investigation is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why this cloud of secrecy?'' said Henry Heller, director of
Virginians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty. Heller pointed
out that members of Barnabei's defense were not allowed to witness
the testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are just taking the word of our governor, and I'm not
comfortable with that at all - that smacks of fascism,'' Heller
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are so many questions'' about the case, Heller said.
''This is not cut and dry and we're not being told the whole
story.''

<HEADLINE> Lieberman sings and schmoozes on late-night shows  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Armed with a warbling voice and a barrel of
wisecracks, Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman
hit the late night talk show circuit Thursday, serenading Conan
O'Brien and bonding with Daily Show host Jon Stewart over their
common Jewish faith.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's genial grin turned mischievous when his story about
singing an old Frank Sinatra standard during his 1988 Senate
campaign prompted O'Brien to invite him to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any chance we can get you to sing 'My Way' for us?'' asked the
comic.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes twinkling, the senator said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This, as they say, could be the end of a beautiful vice
presidential candidacy,'' joked Lieberman, as the band - led by
former Bruce Springsteen drummer Max Weinberg - prepared to
accompany him. ''But what a way to go out.''
</P>
<P>
   His rendition was heartfelt but less than tuneful, and
interrupted by frequent self-deprecating cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all respect to the great Sinatra, who I love,'' said the
senator, who has earned plaudits since his selection as Vice
President Al Gore's running mate for his sense of humor and
easygoing manner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe I'm doing this,'' he moaned. ''Here comes the
finish, Conan.''
</P>
<P>
   The number capped an evening of comedy. Lieberman hurried to
O'Brien's studio after taping an appearance with Stewart on the
cable channel Comedy Central's political satire ''The Daily Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As the first Jewish American on a major ticket, he'll help
this country build a bridge to the 58th Century,'' Stewart cracked
as he introduced Lieberman, referring to the Jewish calendar, which
marks this year as 5760.
</P>
<P>
   The two high-fived about their shared Jewish faith and Stewart
asked to be invited to Passover dinner at the White House next year
should the Gore-Lieberman ticket win.
</P>
<P>
   ''We say, 'Next year in Washington,''' said Lieberman, playing
on Jews' annual Passover promise to celebrate the following year in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   When Stewart asked what the job of the vice president actually
entails, Lieberman called it ''an important question.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been watching old (Johnny) Carson reruns to judge from Ed
McMahon what I should do,'' answered Lieberman, trying out his
sidekick routine.
</P>
<P>
   Tongue in cheek, he praised O'Brien, who recently celebrated his
show's seventh anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you all know ... that during the seven years you've been
doing this show, America has created 22 million new jobs, crime has
fallen ... and we have the strongest economy in our 224-year
history?'' exulted Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Brien urged Lieberman to come up with a better campaign
slogan than ''Go, Joe, Go!'' which supporters chanted at the
Democratic convention, Lieberman offered a few ideas that played on
his ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   He and Gore, he said, had come up with ''A matzoh ball in every
soup,'' ''Gore-Lieberman. No bull. No pork.'' and ''With malice
toward none, but a little guilt for everyone.''

<HEADLINE> Disposable lighters being recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - A New Jersey company is recalling about
294,000 disposable cigarette lighters because they lack federally
required child-resistant mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Vaid Enterprises of Jersey City, N.J., is recalling the lighters
because young children could ignite them, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the company nor the agency is aware of any injuries
involving the lighters.
</P>
<P>
   The disposable lighters being recalled are oval-shaped ''BIC''
and mini-''BIC'' brand lighters. They have a green, red, blue,
black or yellow body and a metal top.
</P>
<P>
   The standard size lighters have the UPC number 3 086120 600020.
The mini-lighters have the UPC number 3 086120 600051.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience, gas, grocery and thrift stores in the East sold the
lighters from January through April for about $1 each.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should stop using these lighters immediately and
return them to the place of purchase for a refund.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, consumers should call the CPSC at

<HEADLINE> Three charged after children found wandering  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAMESTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - Two toddlers found wandering naked and
covered with dirt and feces were placed with their grandmother
after their parents - two brothers and a 19-year-old woman - were
jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Henry J. Myers, 31, Ricky L. Myers, 27, and 19-year-old Rhonda
J. Bromley, who police said all lived together with at least three
children in a ''deplorable'' house, were charged with a misdemeanor
count of failing to control a minor after the two boys - 1 and 2 -
were found walking near the house Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Myers is the father of one of the boys, Ricky Myers the
other. Bromley is the mother of both.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors found the boys wandering in the neighborhood in this
city 58 miles southwest of Buffalo. They cleaned the toddlers up
and went looking for the parents, police said. Neighbors eventually
called police who helped locate the parents.
</P>
<P>
   All three parents said they were asleep and were unaware the
children were missing. Bromley told police an older child, also a
member of the family, must have left the door open on his way to
school. Bromley had been awake but went back to bed because she is
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the rooms in the house where the suspects and
children lived were filthy, with clothing strewn about, overfilled
ashtrays and beer cans everywhere and spoiled food on the floor.
The only pieces of furniture were a stereo system, two mattresses
on the floor, a kitchen table and the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   The accused were jailed on $1,000 bail and are due in court Nov.
21.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Teacher Charged, 1st Ld-Writethru,550  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A teacher accused of sexually abusing
two boys in their beds after their parents' New Year's Eve party
took away the children's faith ''that Mommy and Daddy can protect
them in their own home,'' a prosecutor said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, Steven Nowicki, saw his party invitation as ''the
opportunity to bring to life every parent's nightmare,'' said
Assistant District Attorney Lisa Linsky in her opening statement at
Nowicki's sex abuse trial in Westchester County Court.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney John Mangialardi spoke to the jury only
briefly, asking them to ''keep an open mind,'' and hinting that he
would have an explanation for the prosecution's DNA evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Nowicki, 37, of Hastings-on-Hudson, was a new teacher at Dobbs
Ferry Middle School when the parents of one of his pupils invited
him to an impromptu party on Dec. 31, 1998. ''They wanted him to
feel welcome,'' Linsky said.
</P>
<P>
   He was the last guest to leave, and when he left it was without
saying good-bye and with a wine glass in his hand, the prosecutor
said.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' father, concerned, found Nowicki outside, slumped over
the steering wheel of his idling car as if drunk, Linsky said. But
she suggested that was a ruse, and the trial's first witnesses
testified that Nowicki wasn't drinking heavily at the party.
</P>
<P>
   The father invited Nowicki to ''sleep it off on the couch,'' the
prosecutor said, then went upstairs with his 8- and 10-year-old
sons. But at about 5 a.m., she said, Nowicki stole into the boys'
room, switched off the nightlight and ''orally sodomized and
sexually abused one brother and then the other,'' climbing the
ladder to the top bunk.
</P>
<P>
   He then washed his hands in the bathroom, returned to the boys'
room and ''ostensibly went to sleep'' on the floor, the prosecutor
said.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the parents were ''just footsteps away,'' the
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   The older boy told his parents what had happened, and they found
Nowicki in their sons' room, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the prosecutor's statement, Nowicki turned in his
seat to watch her and the jurors, keeping his head up through even
the most graphic details.
</P>
<P>
   Linsky said swabs taken from one of the boys' private parts
yielded DNA evidence that pointed to Nowicki. But Mangialardi said
a DNA test ''doesn't show you how it got to where it got.'' He did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Linsky said the evidence would also include a signed statement
in which Nowicki said it was ''absolutely possible'' he touched the
boys inappropriately.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will be convinced that this defendant was the man in the
dark who committed this crime against two innocents,'' she told the
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Mangialardi said in an interview that Nowicki, who is free on
$350,000 bail, was ''raring to go.'' He would not say whether the
defendant would testify, though he reminded the jurors that they
may not hold it against him if he doesn't. He said Nowicki has been
unemployed since his arrest, in part because of a court order that
bars him from contact with any children.
</P>
<P>
   Nowicki is accused of sodomy, sexual abuse and endangering
children. If convicted he could be sentenced to up to 25 years in
prison.

<HEADLINE> US Soccer Capitan Reyna Suspended  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. soccer captain Claudio Reyna was suspended
for two World Cup qualifiers on Thursday by FIFA and coach Bruce
Arena was suspended for three games for arguing following the July
23 game at Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions mean the Americans will be missing three players
for their Oct. 11 qualifier against Costa Rica at Columbus, Ohio.
Midfielder Earnie Stewart and Eddie Lewis will be serving one-game
suspensions for their actions in the Sept. 3 win over Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been like that all along, so probably it's par for the
course,'' Arena said in Tampa, Fla., where he watched the start of
Major League Soccer's playoffs. ''You make adjustments. The good
part is over the last year we've still have managed to get enough
guys experience at that level where we can have confidence when
they get on the field they can get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyna, the team's playmaking midfielder, will also miss the
final game of the regional semifinals, on Nov. 15 at Barbados. The
United States needs at least one win in the final two games to
qualify for next year's regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica won 2-1 the July 23 game in San Jose on Hernan
Medford's penalty kick in the final minute, awarded by Jamaican
referee Peter Prendergast, who ruled defender Gregg Berhalter
handled the ball in the penalty area. The Americans were convinced
the ball went off Berhalter's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Reyna and Arena vehemently argued with
Prendergast.
</P>
<P>
   ''The game in Costa Rica was an emotional defeat for us, and our
reactions to that loss were equally emotional,'' Arena said. ''We
acknowledge and understand FIFA's decision in this process, and we
need to put it behind us and move forward in our preparation for
these upcoming games.''
</P>
<P>
   With the suspension of Reyna, Tab Ramos probably will be called
on to run the U.S. offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone that has watched me throughout my career, knows how
uncharacteristic my actions were after the loss in Costa Rica, and
I am sorry for losing my composure,'' Reyna said in a statement
released by th U.S. Soccer Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The USSF is investigating whether it can appeal Arena's
suspension, issued by the disciplinary committee of FIFA, soccer's
governing body. Reyna's suspension is final.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis must sit out the Oct. 11 game because he was ejected from
the Guatemala qualifier for throwing an elbow. Stewart received his
second yellow card of qualifying in that game, drawing an automatic
one-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The United States (2-1-1) is second with seven points in Group E
of the semifinals of soccer's North and Central American and
Caribbean region, two points behind Costa Rica (3-1) and three
points ahead of Guatemala (1-2-1). Barbados (1-3) is last with
three points.
</P>
<P>
   Only the top two teams advance to next year's regional finals,
which will produce three qualifiers for the 2002 World Cup in Japan
and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> First President's Notes on Internet  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Plagued with grave misgivings about his
ability to live up to his young country's expectations, George
Washington prepared to leave the ''domestic felicity'' of Mount
Vernon and make the long journey to New York to take office as the
nation's first president.
</P>
<P>
   These thoughts were recorded in the diaries he had kept since he
was 15, logs that included lively accounts of bedbugs and an Indian
war dance on his first surveying trip. His last note tells of the
snowy weather he ventured into at Mount Vernon the day before his
death on Dec. 14, 1799.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 2,300 entries, which the Library of Congress planned
to put on its Web site Friday, deal with the weather and the
problems of his farms. Only occasionally does Washington confide
some of his inner feelings, as he did on April 16, 1789, after his
election:
</P>
<P>
   ''About 10 o'clock I bade adieu to Mount Vernon, to private life
and to domestic felicity; and with a mind oppressed with more
anxious and painful sensations than I have words to express, set
out for New York ... with the best disposition to render service to
my country in obedience to its call, but with less hope of
answering its expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The library's Web site -- http://www.loc.gov -- will display the
diaries both in Washington's handwriting and in a printed version.
A six-volume edition of the diaries was published between 1976 and
1979 by the University of Virginia Press; about 1,000 copies of
each volume were sold. Portions of the original diaries are in
various collections around the country, with the largest group held
by the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was 13 when he started drawing plots of land in his
''School Exercise Book.'' Three years later he went with his friend
George William Fairfax in a party surveying the south branch of the
Potomac River, not far from Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   The entry for March 23, 1747: ''Rain'd till about two oClock &AMP;
Clear'd when we were agreeably surpis'd at the sight of thirty odd
Indians coming from War with only one scalp. We had some Liquor
with us of which gave them Part. (I)t elevating there spirits put
them in the Humour of Dauncing of whom we had a War Daunce ... The
best Dauncer Jumps up as one awaked out of a Sleep &AMP; Runs &AMP; Jumps
about the Ring in a most comicle Manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington apparently did not keep a diary during most of the
Revolutionary War. But in 1781, he began again, just as the final
campaign was starting. He recorded the first hint of the British
surrender at Yorktown that guaranteed the independence of the 13
British colonies.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 17, 1781, he wrote: ''About 10 oClock the Enemy beat a
parley and Lord Cornwallis proposed a cessation of Hostilities for
24 hours, (so) that Commissioners might meet.''
</P>
<P>
   In those times, generals called a truce by ordering a drummer to
beat an agreed upon signal. Two days later, Cornwallis signed
articles of capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   During the Constitutional Convention, which Washington chaired,
he wrote nothing about the proceedings because they were supposed
to be secret. Always interested in practical household matters, he
wrote on Sept. 3, 1787:
</P>
<P>
   ''In Convention. Visited a Machine at Doctr. (Benjamin)
Franklins (called a mangle) for pressing, in place of Ironing,
clothes from the wash. Which Machine from the facility with which
it dispatches business is well calculated for Table cloths &AMP; such
articles as have not pleats &AMP; irregular foldings and would be very
useful in all large families. Dined, drank Tea, &AMP; spent the evening
at Mr. Morris's.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day the final compromise was reached on how presidents
were to be chosen, by electors. Keeping to the rule of secrecy,
Washington wrote nothing about it.

   SAINT-NOM LA-BRETECHE, France (AP) -- South African Roger Wessels
fired an 8-under-par 63 Thursday for the first-round lead in the
Lancome Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Martin of Spain and Australian Nick O'Hern tied for
second at 64.

   Current money leader Darren Clarke from Northern Ireland fired a
67, as did Masters champion Vijay Singh of Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything clicked today, '' Wessels said. ''I can't recall

<HEADLINE> Liebmeran will now talk about senate debates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Now that his vice presidential debate
schedule has been set, U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman will begin looking
into the possibility of debating his opponent in the race for U.S.
Senate, his campaign said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Philip Giordano is asking for at least two debates,
including an Oct. 19 face-off in New London that was scheduled
before Lieberman was tapped as Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has not committed to any.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want to commit to something locally and then have it
conflict with a national debate,'' said Dan Gerstein, a Lieberman
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, it was announced that Lieberman will debate
Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney on Oct. 5 in
Danville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstein said Lieberman's campaign now ''will have some
discussions internally and then I imagine some talks with Mr.
Giordano and then something will be decided upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Giordano, the mayor of Waterbury, said he was looking forward to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think he needs to campaign in the state, but I'm
extremely pleased he will do debates,'' Giordano said. ''That will
give us the opportunity to get our message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has decided to stay in the Senate race despite running
for vice president, saying he does not want to throw the Democratic
party into the turmoil of choosing a new candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Should he win both races, Lieberman would be forced to resign
his Senate seat. Republican Gov. John G. Rowland would then appoint
a successor. A special election would follow in two years, unless
the General Assembly decided to order one sooner.
</P>
<P>
   In a Quinnipiac College poll taken in July, Lieberman was
favored over Giordano in the Senate race, 71 percent to 14 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Charles Nagy, sidelined since undergoing elbow
surgery in May, was activated Thursday and started the Cleveland
Indians' series finale against the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy made his first start since May 16, going 4 2-3 innings and
leaving with the Indians down 3-0. He gave up three runs and five
hits with three walks and a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Before having chips in his elbow removed on May 17, Nagy was the
Indians' most durable pitcher the past five years. From 1995-99,
the right-hander posted 15 or more wins each season and made 192
starts without missing a turn in the rotation.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Coach Interested in Knight  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indiana Pacers coach Isiah Thomas reasserted
his interest in hiring Bob Knight as a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he first discussed a position with his former
college coach after joining the Pacers in late July.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking for wisdom and I'm looking for knowledge. I hope
that now that he has more time, he would be more involved with me
as a mentor,'' said Thomas, who has never coached at any level.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, fired by Indiana University on Sunday for violating a
zero-tolerance behavior policy imposed by university president
Myles Brand, has said he still wants to coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''That offer still stands and I hope he decides to tutor me,''
said Thomas, who led the Hoosiers to one of their three NCAA
championships under Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at the brainpower that he possesses, and the
knowledge that he possesses about the game ... when you're looking
at passing game and weakside defense, he wrote the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said Knight planned to talk with several friends he
respects, including former NFL coach Bill Parcells, St. Louis
Cardinals manager Tony La Russa and former college basketball coach
Pete Newell, about his future.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the process of doing that, I think he would consider being
more heavily and more involved in myself,'' Thomas said. ''I don't
think I find a better person, or a better coach to help me along.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he was uncertain what role Knight would fill with
the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see him coming to practice every day unless he was
getting paid. From my standpoint, I would love if he would be there
every moment where I could say, 'Hey, coach! What do you think?'
Just like Phil Jackson has with Tex Winter,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would be impossible, because he still wants to coach in
college basketball and he still wants to get his hand involved in
college basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to utilize Knight in a ''Big Brother'' role.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concepts and the thoughts that he came up with and he
invented is the way we practice and play the game,'' said Thomas,
admitting it was uncertain how much Knight would be paid as a
mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ''What would you pay for the Mona Lisa? It's not every day that
you get a chance to sit down and have access to a brain such as
this. A coach, a mentor has been fired and I'm in a position where
I can help. ... As a loyal supporter, as a former player with Bob
Knight, I just want you all to know I'm in the foxhole with him.''

<HEADLINE> Angels' Erstad: Baseball's Secret  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Quietly, Darin Erstad goes about his
daily chores: piling up hits, driving in runs, stealing bases and
making spectacular catches.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's at that level where he's one of the best all-around
players in the game,'' Anaheim teammate Mo Vaughn says.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia thinks Erstad is having an MVP
season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he's not going to get a lot of ink back East, and if
you look at pure numbers, there are some guys with better
numbers,'' he said. ''But when you talk about the whole package,
and what a guy's done over the course of a season and what he's
meant to a ball club, Darin Erstad is head and shoulders above any
other candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Thursday, Erstad led the majors with 216 hits. He was
third in AL batting at .355 with 106 runs and 27 stolen bases. He
had 23 homers and, despite hitting leadoff, had 94 RBIs to give him
a chance to become the first leadoff hitter in major league history
to drive in 100 runs.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth full season, the 26-year-old outfielder has a shot
at rewriting a string of Angels' records, including hits, average
and total bases. He also has a chance to become the first in club
history to total more than 200 hits, 100 runs and 100 RBIs in a
year.
</P>
<P>
   His outstanding season has helped the pitching-strapped Angels
contend in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what he's accomplishing has been remarkable,''
Scioscia said. ''It certainly shows the level he can play at, and
what can happen when an athlete applies himself as much as Darin
has over the last three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's one of those guys who makes a lineup go and makes
everyone around him better.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, 6-foot-2 and 212 pounds, was a kicker on the Nebraska
football team that won the 1994 national title. He was an Academic
All-Big Eight in football and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ''There aren't many players who put together his athletic
ability with his drive to succeed. When you do, you get a special
player,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   This intensity started early.
</P>
<P>
   ''My parents tell stories about how much I hated to lose when I
was a kid. I would cry and throw tantrums,'' said Erstad, smiling
as he sat in front of his locker. ''I always hated to lose,
regardless of what it was, even when the family was playing
Yahtzee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gotten better about it, but I don't think there's any
danger of my ever becoming complacent about losing. ''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia points to a new level of confidence and patience in
Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he understands that every play does not turn out to be
life and death,'' he said. ''He can be intense, but he also is able
to let things go.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's also considerably more outgoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's learned to talk and play at the same time,'' Vaughn said.
''That's when you can enjoy what you're doing. The first three or
four years up here, you're just trying to make your name and do
what you have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''But then, once you learn to be consistent, you can enjoy it
and smile and have fun with it. So he's going to get better at that
as he gets older. By the time he's a 10-year veteran, he'll
probably be the team comedian -- and a great player at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad made his second All-Star appearance this year. But he
insists he still works just as hard. He also remains humble, often
mentioning he hit .253 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a guy who really worked hard in the offseason and
tried to develop some things,'' Angels hitting coach Mickey Hatcher
said. ''What he did in spring training and what he told me that he
wanted to do, he accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's his fielding, often overshadowed by his bat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can guarantee you there's nobody in this league who doesn't
think Darin Erstad's the best left fielder in the league,''
Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Vaughn: ''If it's in the ballpark, he's going to catch
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad reminds Scioscia of another player from not long ago --
Kirk Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   ''That blend of talent, with an intense drive to succeed that
goes beyond what most players possess,'' the Angels' manager said.
</P>
<P>
   And if Erstad hasn't got full recognition, Vaughn predicts that
will change.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to start getting his due,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Investigators regroup after ruling out suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MORRILTON, Ark. (AP) - An Arkansas sheriff said Thursday that a
trucker being held in an Indiana rape case is no longer a suspect
in the slaying of a New Jersey woman at an Interstate 40 rest stop.
</P>
<P>
   Conway County Sheriff Mark Flowers said records from a global
positioning system in the man's truck show that he was nowhere near
the rest area when the woman was killed Aug. 25. Genetic evidence
also cleared the truck driver, Flowers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are just regrouping and getting started with the
investigation again,'' said Cleve Keeling, one of two Conway County
investigators who traveled to Indiana and met with law officers
there.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got all of our evidence in on him and we cannot put him at
the rest area,'' Keeling said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ezagui, 48, of Harker Heights, Texas, had been a suspect
in the slaying of Kristin Ann Laurite, 25, of Scotch Plains, N.J.
Her nude body was found alongside a pond near the rest stop.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers said Thursday that DNA evidence showed no link between
Ezagui and the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Keeling said sheriff's office investigators met Thursday to
regroup. He said officers are continuing to receive tips from
motorists who saw Laurite along her route before she stopped at the
rest area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still just running out every lead we can get,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Ezagui had lied to investigators about his
travels in Arkansas. He said he drove through the state, but notes
in his logbook and receipts indicated he stopped to pick up a load
of frozen food and again to buy fuel in Little Rock, about 45 miles
from the rest area where Laurite was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ezagui came under suspicion in Laurite's death after police were
called to an Indiana rest stop Aug. 29. Witnesses said a naked,
screaming woman was seen jumping from a tractor-trailer at the rest
stop near Henryville, Ind., about 80 miles south of Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   David Makowsky, a detective with the Indiana State Police, said
authorities in several states are investigating Ezagui for possible
links to unsolved murders.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Bristles at Dig by Sydney  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- When demand for shuttle buses overwhelmed Sydney
Olympic organizers just days before the games, one volunteer drew
an instant comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're having an Atlanta experience,'' he moaned.
</P>
<P>
   Say no more. In Sydney's scramble to get ready for the Olympics,
Atlanta has become synonymous with chaos, poor planning and
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   And Atlanta -- a rather defensive city so relentlessly boosterish
that it plastered ''ATLANTA'' in huge, neon-lined letters on a new
arena last year -- doesn't like it one bit.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Sydney's reproach of the Atlanta Games isn't
constructive criticism. It's personal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're totally off base,'' said Dick Yarbrough, who
was spokesman for Atlanta's Olympic organizing committee. ''I don't
think they're in any position to say what they're doing is any
better. They've made their share of mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is trying not to repeat the mistakes of Atlanta, which
staged what some called the Glitch Games. Sydney officials worried
that last week's transportation problems would turn into something
similar to 1996, when drivers from outside Atlanta got lost taking
athletes, journalists and fans to events.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney media are also reassuring Australians the games won't
include a repeat of the embarrassing 1996 closing ceremony, during
which kangaroos wheeled around Atlanta's Olympic Stadium on bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Atlanta Games make no apologies for the way
the Olympics were staged.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had wonderful games,'' said Billy Payne, the homespun
businessman credited with bringing the games to Atlanta. ''When you
double the people in your city, it puts a heck of a load on your
infrastructure, and no one can do that perfectly. But it's the
celebration of humanity and the lifetime experience that most
visitors remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday marks the 10th anniversary of Atlanta's winning the bid
for the Centennial Olympic Games. The vote was a huge upset --
Athens, Greece, was expected to win -- and many Atlantans saw the
games as a chance for the city and the entire Southeast to cast
aside generations of criticism and stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Atlanta Games suffered through technology breakdowns, a
bombing and criticism for everything from the weather to the lack
of museums.
</P>
<P>
   Then Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International
Olympic Committee, closed the Olympics with a stinging backhanded
compliment. Samaranch, who traditionally pronounces each Olympics
''the best ever,'' called the Atlanta Games ''most exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, a city that declared itself ''world-class'' and hoped
the description would catch on, hasn't forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoy where I live,'' 27-year-old Natasha Epps said
defensively. ''I wouldn't move.''
</P>
<P>
   Epps, an administrative assistant who has lived in Atlanta all
her life and worked downtown in the summer of 1996, said: ''I think
they did a great job. I didn't see anything out of the normal. It
was very well handled -- crime, traffic, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In a new book, Yarbrough says that while the city staged a
superb Olympics, Atlanta could not live up to its own hype.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always say that if Atlanta could suck like it could blow,
it'd have the Atlantic Ocean at its city limits,'' Yarbrough said.
''We do tend to talk about ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana White, an Emory University urban historian, said the
absence of anything of national importance in the city and its late
development have created a unique -- if hollow -- boosterism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public relations is very much a part of the culture,''
White said. ''It doesn't have a Wall Street. It doesn't have the
federal government. It doesn't have the industry Chicago has. What
it is is just a corporate crossroads.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne, for one, promised to put all of Sydney's criticism behind
him when he attends the games in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aw, they don't mean any of that stuff personally,'' he said.
''It's just human nature. It doesn't bother us a bit.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Charges Clinton on Tobacco  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has begun exploring
ways to help tobacco farmers, and some Republicans charge it looks
like a political effort to boost support for Al Gore in
tobacco-growing states.
</P>
<P>
   Declining cigarette sales and an increased reliance by companies
on less expensive foreign tobacco has reduced the amount of leaf
U.S. farmers can grow under the federal pricing program.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans from tobacco-growing states say the Clinton
administration is partly to blame because it has pushed for
increased taxes on cigarettes and pursued litigation against
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''This administration has attacked the tobacco industry, which
includes tobacco farmers, for eight years now,'' said Rep. Ernie
Fletcher, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., said White House officials told him
they planned to appoint a commission to look at ways to help
tobacco farmers, including possibly buying their tobacco quotas,
which are allotments under the federal-pricing program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do have it from reliable sources that they're getting ready
to appoint a commission to examine the condition of tobacco farming
and to explore a possible quota buyout plan, which would be
financed by new taxes on cigarettes and the tobacco industry,''
Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield called the effort ''an election-eve scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert confirmed the administration
has been looking at ''reconciling both our public health goals and
our concerns for communities that rely on growing tobacco.''
However, he said the administration had nothing to announce ''at
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Gore has been a zealous critic of tobacco
companies and staunch anti-smoking advocate. Critics question
Gore's motives, noting he was considered a tobacco farming ally
when representing Tennessee in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republican George W. Bush is favored in most tobacco states, but
several are in play, including Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina
and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore recently discussed issues affecting tobacco farmers with
Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton, a Democrat who supports ending the
federal-pricing system, said John-Mark Hack, director of Patton's
office of agricultural policy. One idea under consideration is to
end government pricing and buy out tobacco farmers over a 20-year
period, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway acknowledged the meeting
but said he did not know what was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Agriculture sources say they attended meetings
with White House officials in recent weeks in which a federal
buyout was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've met with them a couple of times to explain the program,
so they would have an understanding of how it works and what the
size of the quota is,'' said one official, who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The source said the Clinton administration favors letting a
commission make the decision on whether to offer a buyout.
</P>
<P>
   ''They realize there are a lot of pitfalls if they were to
announce a plan without thinking it through,'' the source said.

<HEADLINE> Albany's top lawyer will step down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Sol Greenberg, one of the state's longest
tenured district attorneys, announced Thursday he will resign next
week, in time to get a Democrat on November's ballot but too late
for a primary.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, 78, has been district attorney in Albany County for
25 years, winning his first term in November 1974. He said he will
retire to spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been thinking about [resigning] awhile,'' Greenberg said.
''My wife and I enjoy relatively good health. I want to spend more
time with our children and grandchildren and I want to get into a
less pressure job.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the resignation was a political gesture from the
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Long thought to be retiring after this term, Greenberg waited
until after the Sept. 12 primary to announce the resignation,
avoiding any possible Democratic infighting.
</P>
<P>
   If Greenberg had waited until Wednesday, Sept. 20, it would have
been too late to get a name on the ballot and Gov. George E.
Pataki, a Republican, would have had the power to appoint someone
to complete Greenberg's term until January 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's office would not discuss the issue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Paul Clyne, a 15-year-assistant, had
already started organizing for next years election and will likely
get the Democratic nod. Former Assistant District Attorney John
Dorfman, a vocal critic of Greenberg's, has said he wants the post.
</P>
<P>
   Current Chief Assistant District Attorney Larry Wiest will take
over as acting district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg's office developed a reputation of winning lengthy
prison terms - especially in the mid 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenberg also had his share of criticism, particularly for
not prosecuting former Albany County Executive James Coyne for
taking kickbacks during the building of the city's civic arena.
Coyne was prosecuted by federal law enforcement agencies and served
prison time.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney earns $131,400 a year.

<HEADLINE> British Patrol Commander Faulted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The commander of a British army patrol seized by a
renegade army faction in Sierra Leone committed a ''grave mistake''
that allowed his men's capture, and now faces disciplinary action,
the military said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One British paratrooper was killed and more than a dozen others
wounded in a dramatic raid Sunday that freed the six captive
British troops, who had been held for 16 days by a renegade army
faction at a base surrounded by mangrove swamps and jungles. Five
other soldiers from the patrol had been released earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A Ministry of Defense inquiry into the incident found that the
unit's commanding officer, Maj. Alan Marshall of the Royal Irish
Regiment, had made ''an error of professional judgment'' by
diverting from his authorized route on Aug. 25, when the 11-man
patrol was seized.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were taken hostage by a renegade army gang known as
the West Side Boys after visiting a United Nations unit near the
frontline of fighting between rebels and government troops in the
war-ravaged West African country.
</P>
<P>
   British officials had said earlier they had no idea why the
soldiers had driven into the renegades' territory, in Sierra
Leone's Occra Hills, about 45 miles east of the capital, several
miles from the nearest highway patrolled by U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   It was not specified what disciplinary action the unit's
commander would face, but The Ministry of Defense statement said a
court-martial was not expected.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 British troops are in Sierra Leone, training the
nation's shattered defense force to fight an 9-year-old armed
insurgency by the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front that has
left tens of thousands of civilians dead or deliberately mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's firefight -- a dawn strike by 150 British
paratroopers backed by helicopter gunships -- 26 members of the West
Side Boys were killed and 18 others, including the faction's
leader, were captured.
</P>
<P>
   Before the raid, British officials feared for the safety of the
hostages, in part because of threats and erratic behavior by the
West Side Boys, who are notorious for lack of discipline,
drunkenness and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the results of the investigation, the defense
ministry said overall security arrangements for British troops in
Sierra Leone had been found to be adequate, but that commander of
British forces in the country was reminded that troop movements
should be strictly controlled in such a volatile environment.
</P>
<P>
   Some new details about the patrol's capture emerged in the
defense ministry's report. It said that Marshall, after visiting a
United Nations contingent, had diverted his soldiers to the village
of Magbeni, about 50 miles east of Freetown, an area he thought was
free of renegade militias.
</P>
<P>
   But the British troops instead encounted a group of about 25
militiamen, who had a truck with two machine guns. Caught by
surprise, the patrol was quickly overwhelmed and disarmed. Marshall
was struck during the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages were then taken by boat to the renegades' creekside
base, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior British military official, whose identity was not
disclosed, traveled to Sierra Leone to oversee the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton 'Troubled' With Lee Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a rare public disagreement, President
Clinton said Thursday that Wen Ho Lee's long detention ''just can't
be justified,'' but Attorney General Janet Reno refused to
apologize and said the confinement was the nuclear scientist's own
fault.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Lee, a former Los Alamos laboratory scientist,
went free Wednesday after pleading guilty to one felony of
mishandling weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Reno told her weekly news conference that Lee could have avoided
nine months of detention by agreeing earlier to plead guilty and
tell the government what he did with the secrets.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said ''the safety of the nation
demands that we take this important step'' under which Lee was
sentenced to the 278 days he had served. The government dropped 58
other counts.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Reno spoke, Clinton expressed an opinion far closer
to that of U.S. District Judge James Parker, who said Lee's
detention ''embarrassed our entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who met with Justice officials at the White House
before Lee's indictment last Dec. 10, said he found it difficult in
retrospect to reconcile how the government could ''keep someone in
jail without bail, argue right up to the 11th hour that they're a
terrible risk, and then turn around and make that sort of plea
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It just can't be justified. ... I too am quite troubled by
it,'' Clinton said. Reno did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are heartened that the president of the United States
appears to share some of the concerns that Judge Parker expressed
in his eloquent order yesterday,'' Lee attorney Mark Holscher said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters
Clinton's comments should not be read ''as a blanket criticism of
anyone'' and added that Reno and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
retain Clinton's support.
</P>
<P>
   Also, on David Letterman's show, Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic presidential nominee, refused to say whether the Justice
Department should apologize, saying he did not want to comment on
an ongoing legal proceeding, but he did note ''the underlying
problem was very serious because nuclear secrets have to be
protected absolutely and completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who have spent months calling Reno too timid in
investigating leaks from Los Alamos slammed her for being too
aggressive with Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Reno and Richardson would resign
if they ''had any honor and any shame.'' Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
who is leading a subcommittee probe of the case, said it looked
like Justice and the FBI ''threw the book at Dr. Lee to make up for
their own failings.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Reno said she was comfortable with the government's
handling of the case. ''I'm not embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Dr. Lee, from the beginning, had the opportunity to
answer this and I think now he needs to look to himself,'' rather
than expect a government apology, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The government ''tried from the beginning'' to win Lee's
cooperation to help verify his claim that he had destroyed seven of
10 computer tapes he made of nuclear weapons data. ''We now have
what we sought then,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee now acknowledges illegally transferring the data from a
highly secure computer at the nuclear weapons lab into personal
files on an unsecure computer where, Reno said, it was ''accessible
to intruders, hackers or other governments who could hack into that
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   ''With all my heart and soul,'' Reno said she wished ''Dr. Lee
had come forward, said, 'This is what I did with the information
... (and) I'll ... try to give you as much information as possible
to permit you to confirm and corroborate it.''' If he had done so,
the government would have reconsidered detention and its charges,
Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Parker said he wished prosecutors had taken up an
offer from Lee's attorneys that arrived the day of his indictment
to submit to a polygraph test ''to confirm that he did not provide
the tapes to any third party.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor George Stamboulidis said the government did pursue it
but concluded it was ''cosmetic, not a real offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys would allow only two questions, Stamboulidis
said: Did Lee destroy the tapes? Did Lee pass them to others? ''How
can you test his credibility with only two questions?''
</P>
<P>
   ''He always held the key to his jail cell the same way he held
the fate of the nation in those tapes,'' Stamboulidis said.
</P>
<P>
   Stamboulidis disputed Parker's contention he was misled about
the seriousness of the case against Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The data Lee removed came from 1,000 missile tests and was
classified restricted from its very creation, Stamboulidis said. It
existed in only two government labs behind fences and armed guards
until Lee copied it ''into a personal library ... in a 'have
documents, will travel' position.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker asked how the government could insist on Lee's
confinement as a security risk right up to the moment of agreeing
to set him free.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no way we would let him communicate with others
before he told us what he did with those tapes,'' Stamboulidis
said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plea bargain, the government has already received
three written sworn statements from Lee with more detail than he
provided before, Stamboulidis said. Those are being checked through
computer forensics and other witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also agreed to weeks of questioning, polygraph tests
acceptable to the government and to having the entire indictment
reinstated along with new perjury charges if he lies.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he is caught in a lie, a whole world of horribles befalls
him,'' Stamboulidis said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a still-sealed rider governing Lee's movements gives the
government assurance he will not flee the country.

<HEADLINE> US Soccer Captain Reyna Suspended  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. soccer captain Claudio Reyna was suspended
for two World Cup qualifiers on Thursday by FIFA and coach Bruce
Arena was suspended for three games for arguing following the July
23 game at Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions mean the Americans will be missing three players
for their Oct. 11 qualifier against Costa Rica at Columbus, Ohio.
Midfielder Earnie Stewart and Eddie Lewis will be serving one-game
suspensions for their actions in the Sept. 3 win over Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been like that all along, so probably it's par for the
course,'' Arena said in Tampa, Fla., where he watched the start of
Major League Soccer's playoffs. ''You make adjustments. The good
part is over the last year we've still have managed to get enough
guys experience at that level where we can have confidence when
they get on the field they can get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyna, the team's playmaking midfielder, will also miss the
final game of the regional semifinals, on Nov. 15 at Barbados. The
United States needs at least one win in the final two games to
qualify for next year's regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a loss certainly,'' Arena said. ''It's not a loss we
welcome. He's been very good for us. We're going to have to live
with it and move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica won 2-1 the July 23 game in San Jose on Hernan
Medford's penalty kick in the final minute, awarded by Jamaican
referee Peter Prendergast, who ruled defender Gregg Berhalter
handled the ball in the penalty area. The Americans were convinced
the ball went off Berhalter's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Reyna and Arena vehemently argued with
Prendergast.
</P>
<P>
   ''The game in Costa Rica was an emotional defeat for us, and our
reactions to that loss were equally emotional,'' Arena said. ''We
acknowledge and understand FIFA's decision in this process, and we
need to put it behind us and move forward in our preparation for
these upcoming games.''
</P>
<P>
   With the suspension of Reyna, Tab Ramos probably will be called
on to run the U.S. offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone that has watched me throughout my career, knows how
uncharacteristic my actions were after the loss in Costa Rica, and
I am sorry for losing my composure,'' Reyna said in a statement
released by th U.S. Soccer Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The USSF is investigating whether it can appeal Arena's
suspension, issued by the disciplinary committee of FIFA, soccer's
governing body. Reyna's suspension is final.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an appeal process,'' Arena said. ''I haven't
discussed this yet with U.S. Soccer. That's their decision to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis must sit out the Oct. 11 game because he was ejected from
the Guatemala qualifier for throwing an elbow. Stewart received his
second yellow card of qualifying in that game, drawing an automatic
one-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The United States (2-1-1) is second with seven points in Group E
of the semifinals of soccer's North and Central American and
Caribbean region, two points behind Costa Rica (3-1) and three
points ahead of Guatemala (1-2-1). Barbados (1-3) is last with
three points.
</P>
<P>
   Only the top two teams advance to next year's regional finals,
which will produce three qualifiers for the 2002 World Cup in Japan
and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Mixed Blessing for Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- It may be hard for Mexican officials to keep
a straight face while bemoaning high oil prices, with billions of
dollars in extra oil revenue now flowing into government coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, high crude prices are hardly an unqualified victory even
for an oil-exporter like Mexico. Globalization has bound it to the
U.S. economy, and manufactured exports -- vulnerable to high fuel
prices -- are now Mexico's mainstay, not oil.
</P>
<P>
   The government is expected to collect some $3.6 billion in extra
oil revenue this year. How that windfall is spent may well decide
whether the price boom ultimately benefits or hurts Mexico, the
world's fifth-largest oil producer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tale about how globalization has put Mexico on the horns
of a dilemma: the peso gained in value as oil prices rose, but then
lost ground Wednesday as oil hit $35 per barrel -- because markets
saw that price as detrimental to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico ''should be careful, and not be too greedy,'' said Fausto
Alzati, who is coordinating energy affairs for president-elect
Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has sounded even more concerned, saying ''prices should not
hold back growth, because if this happens, the first to be affected
would be Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Many see the expressions of concern as disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're play-acting ... laughing all the way to the bank,''
said Walter Molano, an analyst at BCP Securities in Connecticut who
also suggested that ''Mexico is lining itself up for a recession,
for a pretty severe shock right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still it's a far cry from the 1970s, when Mexican officials saw
international economics in Darwinian terms: some countries are
fortunate enough to have oil, some aren't. The president at the
time, Jose Lopez Portillo, proudly announced that his main job was
to ''manage all the wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said this week he wants ''a fair price,'' but has a tough
time determining what exactly that would be. His 2001 budget plan
is expected to set a projected price of about $18 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   But Energy Minister Luis Tellez predicted prices will remain
much higher than that for months to come -- a situation he blamed on
the bargains enjoyed for years by oil-consuming countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the low prices in 1997, 1998 and 1999, there were
few investments (in production), so now demand is using up all the
capacity,'' Tellez said, explaining why Mexico can't increase
output by a promised 200,000 barrels per day in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   The memories of the lean times -- when oil prices dropped below
$10 per barrel, forcing government spending cuts -- makes it hard
for many here to be too sympathetic about price complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a small little blip of compensation, that's called
justice,'' said Federico Estevez, a political scientist at the
Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   There's a sense of injustice among oil-producing nations being
blamed for the problem. Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez noted
that ''the principal factor that increases (fuel prices) for the
man who goes to the gas station to fill his tank, are high taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which
Mexico is not a member, estimates that taxes and refining
activities contribute to 84 percent of gasoline prices while the
price of crude contributes 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And international oil prices, in real terms, are nowhere near
the levels seen in the 1980s. Taking into account inflation, even
at current prices oil remains a bargain, Molano notes.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico has changed a lot in the 1990s, becoming a sort of
hybrid of producer-consumer. Domestic fuel prices have been raised
to international levels, so consumers here don't get any breaks.
</P>
<P>
   And now, roughly three-quarters of Mexico's exports are
manufacturing goods -- most bound for U.S. markets -- and oil
accounts for less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are any concerns on the U.S. economy, that will
affect Mexico,'' said Gabriel Sod-Hoffs, a currency analyst at
Chase Securities. ''If the economy cools down too much, then all of
(Mexico's) other exports would slow down and that would be
dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   What Mexico should do, analysts say, is use the oil money to pay
down debt, and reduce the government's reliance on oil income --
which currently accounts for about a third of federal revenues -- by
implementing tax reforms.
</P>
<P>
   If not, Mexico could relive the dark days of the early 1980s,
when the government spent oil money freely and ran up debt. Then
the world economy slowed, crude prices plummeted and Mexico entered
a recession.
</P>
<P>
   But many people in Mexico, long battered by the whims of crude
markets, have become a bit fatalistic about events far beyond their
control.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a wheel of fortune,'' said Estevez. ''When it turns
again, we'll be back where we started.''

<HEADLINE> Fifth bottle sickens man, questions about city delay in informing public </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - In separate incidents, two men became ill after
drinking from bottles of possibly contaminated water on Thursday,
the fourth and fifth such incidents in the New York City area in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, however, cautioned that the four cases
that occurred in the city are not necessarily linked, and city
officials said that while an investigation into the incidents is
continuing, no action was planned except to warn consumers to take
precautions before drinking bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get bottled water or soda, make sure that it's sealed
... and smell it before you drink it,'' said Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   But consumers in the city remained largely unperturped by the
suspected tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Questions arose however Thursday about whether the city informed
residents about the potential for risk in a timely manner when an
FBI official said the city health department told his agency about
the contaminations and possible tampering several days before the
mayor and top police officials were informed.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, it was the FBI - not the city health department -
who told police about the contaminations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In one possible contamination case Thursday in which a
30-year-old man complained of an upset stomach and a burning
sensation in his mouth after drinking Poland Spring water, a 7-11
store in Bayshore, Long Island removed the product from its
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   In the other most recent incident, a man suffered from nausea
and burning in his throat after drinking from a bottle of Aqua Fina
water purchased at a deli in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions of the men were not immediately known, but
previous victims - including an 18-month old child - recovered
after brief hospital stays.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on two of the contaminated bottles have revealed traces of
an ammonia-like substance, while a third bottle contained lye.
Tests on the bottles in Thursday's incidents have not yet been
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if water should be pulled from store shelves in the city,
Giuliani said, ''Let's not get people more excited than they have
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The contaminations however have been dissimilar in enough ways
that investigators are still unsure whether they are linked.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the incidents occurred in disparate areas
involving varying distribution methods and distributors. And in the
city cases, two of the bottles of contaminated water came from
water purchased at delis, while one occurred at a take-out
restaurant and another at Benihana, a sit-down restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, two of the four city incidents involved Aqua Fina
water, while one was Poland Spring and a fourth Perrier.
</P>
<P>
   In the Aug. 27 and Sept. 6 incidents, an ammonia-like substance
was detected in the water, while traces of lye were found after the
first case - which occurred Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot draw the conclusion that the cases are linked,''
said Giuliani. ''It's too early to tell what kind of trend (is
occurring) or exactly what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is investigating the contaminations along with the NYPD.
</P>
<P>
   While the first incident occurred August 3, Giuliani said he
only learned about the first three contaminations from the police
department on September 12. Police spokesman Tom Antenen said his
department was informed by the FBI the same day.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI spokesman Joseph Valiquette said his agency was told
about the contaminations by the health department on Sept.8 -- five
days before the mayor held a press conference announcing the
possible tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department spokeswoman Sandra Mullin said the department
suspected tampering on Sept. 6, but could not explain the delay in
informing top city officials or issuing public health warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't connect the potential tampering until the 6th,'' she
said. ''I can't really answer the other questions.''
</P>
<P>
   At convenience stores and delis around the city, customers were
taking reports of the tamperings in stride, as store managers
reported that sales of bottled water had been largely unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are buying as usual, but I have noticed that they are
being cautious about checking the caps, to make sure everything is
sealed,'' said the manager of a deli on lower Broadway in Manhattan
who declined to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mikulka, a musician from Manhattan who bought a bottle of
Poland Spring from a midtown Manhattan deli, said he would not stop
buying water from stores.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I'll just have to be more careful about checking the
safety wrapper,'' he said. ''I try not to worry about these things
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   David O. Smith, who was also carrying a bottle of Poland Spring,
compared the contaminations to the public relations problems
Firestone has undergone since a series of motor vehicle deaths
occurred after tire blow-outs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really goes back to the manufacturer and their quality
control,'' said Smith. ''What they're really selling is the purity
of their water. For that image to be affected is a real nightmare,
even worse than Firestone.''

<HEADLINE> Lane's End Sells Filly for $600K  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A dark bay filly from Lane's End Farm sold
for $600,000, the top price Thursday during the fourth session of
the Keeneland September Yearling Sale.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Mansell bought the filly, by Belong to Me and out of the
Seattle Slew mare Lassie Connection.
</P>
<P>
   Belong to Me has become a popular young stallion who has already
sired stakes winners Jersey Girl, Belle Cherie, Terreavigne,
Dancewiththebride, Circle of Life, and Lucky Roberto. The mare,
Lassie Connection, is the dam of stakes winner Winning Connection
and stakes-placed winners Thrilla in Manila and Houston Connection.
</P>
<P>
   Keeneland sold 261 horses on Thursday for a total of
$27,132,000. The average price was $103,954 and the median price
was $60,000. A year ago, on the fourth day of the sale, Keeneland
sold 297 head for $22,478,500 with an average price of $75,685 and
a median of $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   After a record-setting start, the buying rates at the auction
have tailed off slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Keeneland has sold 976 yearlings for a grand total of
$220,799,500 during the first four days of the 13-day sale. The
average price is $226,229 and the median is $120,000. A year ago,
Keeneland had sold 1,052 yearlings for $171,364,000 with an average
price of $162,894 and a median of $90,000 through the first four
days.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's End, the William Farish-owned farm in nearby Versailles,
has been the sale's hottest consignor. Lane's End had sold
$45,697,000 worth of yearlings coming into the fourth session and
sold another $4,105,000 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been unbelievable,'' Farish said. ''It's been beyond our
wildest expectations. But I think the market shows that there is
plenty of money out there for the good-looking horses with solid
pedigrees. I think it will keep going, too. I think it will be
strong right through the weekend. There are still a lot of people
here and they are all looking for horses.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Russia To Resume Flights  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq and Russia are in discussions to
resume air travel between the two countries, officials at both
national airlines said Thursday, but it is uncertain when
commercial flights will resume.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run al-Thawra daily on Thursday quoted Pavel Pryadko,
the regional director in Jordan of the Russian official airline,
Aeroflot, as saying flights will begin next month.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Aeroflot spokeswoman Yulia Maryashkina confirmed that
the company was considering resuming flights to Iraq, but would not
specify when. Another Aeroflot official, who refused to be
identified, said no specific time for the resumption of flights has
been set, and that Aeroflot is still engaged in complex
negotiations with Iraq on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain and the U.N. Sanctions Committee
maintain that civil flights to and from Iraq constitute an economic
resource whose reinstatement is a breach of the sanctions in place
since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and France, Iraq's strongest allies on the U.N. Security
Council, say the council never adopted a specific text banning all
flights to and from Iraq. Baghdad also argues that there are no
U.N. resolutions governing the 1991 Persian Gulf War cease-fire
that prevent civilian planes from flying in and out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Aeroflot issued a statement Thursday, saying that under pre-Gulf
War agreements with Iraq, ''Aeroflot has the right to carry out
regular flights between Moscow and Baghdad.'' The airline insisted
there was no formal U.N. ban on passenger air traffic, but noted
the U.S. and British interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the situation that has formed around Iraq, Aeroflot at
the present time is considering issues of long-term cooperation,''
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, speaking at the
United Nations, was asked if the flights were the beginning of an
effort to chip away at U.N. sanctions against Iraq. France has said
it would not block humanitarian flights to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   She said all countries must abide by Security Council resolution
1284 approved last December which created a new U.N. weapons
inspection agency for Iraq and spelled out conditions which Baghdad
had to fulfill to get sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I have said before, 1284 is the roadmap for Saddam Hussein
to get out of the box -- the sanctions box, if that's what he
wants,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We disagree with those who wish to fly into Iraq. And I will
make that clear when I see (Russian) Foreign Minister (Igor) Ivanov
in a little while. And I don't think it's a good idea,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are abiding by 1284 and we expect others to do so,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Vnukovskiye Airline has signed papers with Iraqi
Airways ahead of plans to make regular flights to Baghdad,
according to a report by Russian news agency ITAR-Tass earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's Saddam International Airport was last used for commercial
flights hours before the outbreak of the 1991 Gulf War. Since then,
only a few planes have landed, mainly carrying humanitarian aid.
The airport was officially reopened for business in August.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Gulf War, Iraq deposited its civilian fleet in
Jordan, Iran, Tunisia and Mauritania. Baghdad also smuggled its
warplanes to Iran, which took possession of the jet fighters when
the war broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has been denied U.N. authorization to return its civilian
planes. The only plane now in use is an old Russian transport IL-76
plane that has transported Iraqi pilgrims to Saudi Arabia for the
last three years.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. resolutions say the sanctions are to remain in place until
Baghdad complies with demands to dismantle its weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Opposition To Test Freedoms  </HEADLINE>
By AYE AYE WIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Leaders of Myanmar's pro-democracy
movement, released Thursday after two weeks of unofficial house
arrest, said they will quickly begin political organizing to test
the limits of freedom allowed by the military government.
</P>
<P>
   Aung San Suu Kyi and the eight other leaders of her National
League for Democracy party had been confined to their homes, denied
telephone contact and visits by all but their closest relatives.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the junta said the party members ''are no
longer required to stay at their respective residences'' and have
been allowed to resume ''their daily activities as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats who previously were blocked from calling on the party
leaders made visits Thursday. U.S. charge d'affaires Priscilla
Clapp went to Suu Kyi's house, and Suu Kyi told Clapp that she and
other party members were in good health, the U.S. Embassy reported.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's party said it will test the government's sincerity
Friday when it reopens the party headquarters. It had been searched
and sealed off by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The National League for Democracy's vice chairman, Tin Oo, said
party leaders will also try to travel outside Yangon again for
party work.
</P>
<P>
   When Suu Kyi and Tin Oo tried to drive to Kungyangon on Aug. 24,
they were stopped by security forces, who brought them back to the
capital after a nine-day standoff and then confined the party
leaders to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will find out if we will be allowed freedom of movement,''
Tin Oo told The Associated Press. ''We will travel again because we
did not reach Kungyangon last time. So we will try again.''
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions against the party leaders drew international
criticism, mainly from the United States and Britain, who accused
the regime of violating the Myanmar opposition leaders' political
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
reporters at U.N. headquarters that she was ''gratified'' that Suu
Kyi is now able to receive some people at her residence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do believe that a concerted effort here at the United
Nations through a variety of ways to state the international
community's disgust with what the government authorities had done
has had some impact,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan also welcomed the developments but
repeated his call on the government ''to engage in a substantive
political dialogue with opposition leaders, including Aung San Suu
Kyi, to initiate the process of national reconciliation as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The junta had cited an investigation into what it said were the
democracy party's suspected links with terrorists as the reason for
imposing the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   It also described Suu Kyi, 55, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize
winner, as a traitor collaborating with Western nations to
destabilize Myanmar. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled
by the military since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The party's chairman, Aung Shwe, met Thursday with Lt. Gen. Khin
Nyunt, the third-ranking general in the ruling junta, the
government statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Khin Nyunt was quoted as saying: ''We have very much appreciated
the NLD's understanding of the government's fundamental obligation
and responsibility to protect the rights of all its citizens to a
safe, secure and stable environment and to safeguard the national
security during the nation's transition to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   No further details were available of the rare meeting between
the party and the regime, which refused to honor the party's
sweeping 1990 general election victory. The junta also put Suu Kyi
under house arrest between 1989 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Tin Oo said the 10-minute meeting had no meaning because Suu Kyi
was not present.

<HEADLINE> Ticket Surcharge Hits Packers Fans  </HEADLINE>
By TODD RICHMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Tradition went head-to-head with
pocketbooks Thursday as Green Bay season-ticket holders struggled
with a surcharge to help pay for renovations at Lambeau Field.
</P>
<P>
   Some called the surcharge a slap in the face to loyal fans who
have backed the team through losing seasons. But few said they
would give up their tickets, family heirlooms for many.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole thing reeks,'' said Arvin Schultz, who faces $5,600
in fees for four tickets to seats on the 30-yard line that his late
father-in-law passed down after three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I think of all those years my dad used them, I'm hurt
this is what we mean by 'feel the tradition,''' said his wife, Judy
Schultz, referring to the stadium's logo. ''We'll find a way to pay
it. We won't give them back.''
</P>
<P>
   The surcharges are part of the Packers' $295 million plan to
revamp the aging stadium. The project calls for 10,000 new seats at
the 43-year-old stadium and an atrium to house the Packer Hall of
Fame and other amenities the team hopes will bring in revenue
year-round.
</P>
<P>
   The team says it needs more money from a revamped stadium to
stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The plan became reality Tuesday when Brown County voters
approved a half-percent sales tax to pay back $160 million in
Lambeau construction loans. The vote divided the community and
bruised its famed love affair with the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers expect to raise $92.5 million through the one-time
seat fees once details for the payments are finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Fans with three-game packages will pay $600 per ticket. Fans
like the Schultzes with seven-game packages will pay $1,400 per
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely gouging,'' Arvin Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   John Jones, Packers vice president of administration, said seat
fees are a common fundraising tactic in the NFL. He stressed the
fees were one-time assessments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The organization is very mindful of the effect of costs on
ticket holders,'' he said. ''But we're part of an industry in the
NFL where costs continue to escalate.''

   The Atlanta right-hander gave up only two runs in the inning and
Javy Lopez broke out of a 2-for-26 slump with a pair of run-scoring
singles as the Atlanta Braves rallied to beat the Florida Marlins
5-3 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby (10-12) gave up a two-run single in the first to Mike
Lowell, then held Florida scoreless until the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just out of synch a little bit, but after I got my
rhythm going I made the pitches I needed to,'' Ashby said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which remained two games ahead of second-place New York
in the NL East, won its second straight and completed a 6-3
homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, 6-5 since the Braves acquired him from Philadelphia on
July 12, allowed three runs and eight hits in 7 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first inning was a big one for us. They easily could have
gotten four runs, instead they got two,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox
said. ''But Andy was able to turn it around, get the strikeout and
pop. After that he was picture perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell's single put Florida ahead 2-0 and left the Marlins with
runners at the corners for Derrek Lee with one out. Ashby struck
out Lee and retired Alex Gonzalez on a flyout.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strikeout was big,'' Ashby said. ''Thank God we made the
pitches and didn't give up more than two runs.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker, Atlanta's third pitcher, walked his first batter on
four pitches leading off the ninth, then struck out the side for
his 21st save in 23 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who went 2-for-3 with a walk, singled off Reid Cornelius
(3-9) for a 3-2 lead in the sixth after Wally Joyner walked and
Brian Jordan singled.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart, who also drove in two runs, followed with a
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones singled off Ricky Bones with two outs in the
seventh, stole second and scored on a single by Andres Galarraga to
make it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Wilson's RBI double chased Ashby in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius (3-9) dropped to 0-7 in 12 starts since beating
Montreal on July 2, giving up four runs and eight hits in 5 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, you think about it,'' he said of the losing streak,
''but you have to put it out of your mind and just pitch. I just
happen to be in this streak right now. No one says the game of
baseball is fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez and Lockhart hit run-scoring singles that tied the game in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Umpire Steve Rippley missed his second straight game due to
an illness. He was replaced by Morris Hodges, who umpired in the
Pacific Coast League this season. ... Before beating Montreal 3-2
in his last start, Ashby hadn't won since July 8, going 0-4 with a
no-decision.

<HEADLINE> Cheney a Tad Off on Details in Ohio  </HEADLINE>
By LIZ SIDOTI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ohio (AP) -- The gym was stuffy, the day long and the
Republican vice presidential candidate prone to a few mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   When Dick Cheney spoke at Marietta high school Thursday, he
pitched ''Reagan'' proposals at one point when he meant those of
presidential candidate George W. Bush. He also stumbled over the
election date, saying Dec. 7 instead of Nov. 7. Then he corrected
himself on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going home to Wyoming Saturday to rest,'' Cheney, 59, told
reporters later.
</P>
<P>
   ''But, no, I'm not especially tired.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted he's been campaigning nearly every day since July.
</P>
<P>
   Later in Paducah, Ky., Cheney was to have faced a small
demonstration from students worried that he was going to skip a
planned Oct. 5 debate with Democratic running mate Joe Lieberman in
Danville, four hours away.
</P>
<P>
   But news that a deal had been reached for that debate and three
debates between the presidential candidates turned the protest into
a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The seven students, who had driven four hours from Centre
College in Danville, the venue for the debate, were ushered into
second-row seats in the packed hall where Cheney spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can say here tonight with absolute confidence and conviction
that there will be a vice presidential debate in Danville on Oct.
5,'' Cheney said to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things worked out well,'' said Clarence Wyatt, a professor who
accompanied the students.
</P>
<P>
   In his Marietta appearance, Cheney told the students, teachers
and parents that education -- as well as the military, Social
Security and Medicare -- has not improved during the Democratic
administration.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and Bush are serious about an education plan that
emphasizes local control of schools, high standards and
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elections are about choosing leaders and holding those leaders
accountable,'' Cheney said as someone responded, ''Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said public schools are the ''heart of our education
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Moyer, 16, pressed Cheney on his support of vouchers
that give public money to parents who want to send their children
to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said vouchers, which he and Bush would use for poor
children in failing schools, are not intended to damage public
education. And on college costs, he noted the Republican plan
proposes more money for grants and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   One student asked Cheney whether she would be better off with
financial help proposed by Democrat Al Gore than with Bush's plan
to increase Pell grants for first-year college students. Cheney
said the Bush-Cheney plan would help college students by providing
grants for advanced courses and allowing families to spend more on
education by reducing taxes.

<HEADLINE> 30,000 gallons of diesel fuel leak into Sandy Hook Bay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANDY HOOK, N.J. (AP) - A cleanup operation was under way
Thursday after 30,000 gallons of diesel fuel leaked from a U.S.
Navy vessel into Sandy Hook Bay and left a slick 1-3/4 miles long
and 1/2 mile wide.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Coast Guard officials said the fuel leaked from a 4-foot
hole in the hull of the USS Detroit, a Navy refueling vessel that
was mooring about 4:20 p.m. on Thursday at the Naval Weapons
Station Earle Pier.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard has begun an investigation to determine what
caused the hole, according to Petty Officer Angelo Patti.
</P>
<P>
   Patti said none of the fuel appears to have reached land.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't had calls from people complaining,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Crews pumped fuel out to a point below the hole to stop more
fuel from leaking into the bay, Patti said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard has closed the bay to boat traffic. Patti said
officials don't know how long it will remain closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've set up a security zone. Sandy Hook channel is closed,''
he said. ''Patrol boats are keeping pleasure boats and others
out.''
</P>
<P>
   A Navy response team, a Coast Guard pollution response team and
two boats from private contractors are involved in the cleanup,
according to Patti.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Navy is using a skimmer, a boat that separates the
fuel from the water and sucks it out. One of the contractors is
using 8,000 feet of boom and the other is using 5,000 feet in the
effort to contain the leak, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel leak flowed northwest, according to Patti. He said it
is too early too determine what effects the leak will have on
wildlife in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, with this many people responding and the equipment
available it should eliminate most effects,'' Patti said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it is too early to determine how long cleanup
operations will take.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Detroit is based at Naval Weapons Station Earle Pier.

<HEADLINE> FBI called to investigate civil rights violations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation will
look into charges that city police violated the civil rights of
teen-agers involved in a melee earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   More than six complaints have been filed, all by
African-American teen-agers, police said. A police union spokesman
said charges of racism were ''wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was total havoc,'' said Patrick Sullivan. ''For them to say
it was because the youths were mostly black is wrong. We would have
reacted this way if the crowd was Mexican, Chinese, white.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine teen-agers were arrested Sept. 3 after a fight broke out
following an alcohol-free party downtown. With a couple of hundred
people standing around, 15 police officers arrived to quell the
disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old girl struggled with officers, spitting on them and
biting. When police piled her into a cruiser, she kicked out two
windows.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year-old boy charged with second-degree harassment,
disorderly conduct and resisting arrest said an officer grabbed him
off his bike and pushed him against a bridge railing, spraying him
with pepper spray when the boy tried to back away.
</P>
<P>
   A police dog bit him on the leg as he knelt on the sidewalk in
handcuffs, the boy said.
</P>
<P>
   Police acknowledge using pepper spray but said the dog was kept
on a leash and ordered to attack only when a pair of officers were
being stomped. None of the officers received injuries that kept
them out of work.
</P>
<P>
   A timetable for the FBI probe was not given.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Mayoral Race Picks Up Steam  </HEADLINE>
By JUDY LIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- While the presidential candidates haggled
over their debate schedule Thursday, mayoral hopefuls in Los
Angeles cordially held their eighth debate -- seven months before
the election.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five leading candidates squared off over police
corruption and urban environmental issues with none of the
squabbling that had, until Thursday, stymied efforts to get Al Gore
and George W. Bush together.
</P>
<P>
   The quartet included two Hispanic lawmakers, a city councilman
and a businessman. If voters elect a Hispanic in April, it will
mark the first Hispanic mayor in the nonpartisan office in 129
years.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan is unable to run again due to term limits.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department has been under fire since allegations
surfaced that anti-gang officers lied under oath, falsified
reports, planted evidence and even shot unarmed suspects. Law
enforcement was a top issue at the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe it's humanly possible for people to look at
themselves objectively,'' Councilman Joel Wachs said in urging
outside help to clean up the department.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell you, the Police Department is not going to reform
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   All four candidates agreed that Police Chief Bernard Parks
should be held accountable for the department's failures, but urged
caution in acting too quickly and were vague about what should be
done. Three advocated a consent decree with the U.S. government
because they believe the department has failed to reform itself.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have been debating whether the city should sign
the consent decree that would call for a judge to monitor the
department and ensure reforms are carried out. The Justice
Department would, in exchange, drop a planned lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''By opposing the consent decree, we're saying 'go ahead sue
me,''' said Rep. Xavier Becerra, a Los Angeles Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa also favored the consent
decree.
</P>
<P>
   ''This city needs to move beyond the crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Businessman Steve Soboroff, Riordan's choice for mayor, opposed
the consent decree. He said crime would rise as officers leave the
streets to process paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney James Hahn was the only major candidate who didn't
appear. He said he had a scheduling conflict.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia: No Deal on Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah said
Thursday there can be no compromise over East Jerusalem and offered
his country's backing to Palestinians negotiating a final
settlement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing to negotiate about and compromise on when it
comes to Jerusalem,'' the crown prince told a group of
Arab-American and Muslim leaders at a New York hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jerusalem is important to the hearts of all Muslims and in
fact it's in the heart of everybody with a sense of humanity. This
is something on which there can be no compromise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crown prince, who has been running the affairs of Saudi
Arabia since King Fahd suffered a stroke in 1995, came to New York
for the U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the group of several dozen people attending the session
applauded his comments on the sensitive issue of East Jerusalem,
which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Israel claims both Arab eastern and the Jewish Western sector as
its capital. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital
of their future state.
</P>
<P>
   Jews revere the walled compound they call Temple Mount in the
Old City as home of their ancient temples. To Muslims, the plot is
the Noble Sanctuary, the spot where the Prophet Mohammed ascended
to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Talks in Camp David in July broke up over the question of
sovereignty in Jerusalem. Mediators have floated possible
compromises such as international sovereignty or even divine
sovereignty -- putting God in charge -- while other proposals
suggested deferring the question of sovereignty to a later date.
</P>
<P>
   The backing of Saudi Arabia, home to the other Islamic holy
sites in Mecca and Medina, for any deal on Jerusalem is viewed as
crucial. Saudi Arabia is also the richest Arab country and a key
U.S. ally in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah didn't answer specifically when asked whether Saudi
Arabia and other Arab states were playing a role in negotiations,
saying only that Saudi Arabia backed the Palestinians in their
talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations later Thursday, Saudi Arabia emphasized
its backing for Palestinian sovereignty in East Jerusalem, saying
''Israel is making a big mistake'' if it thinks it can achieve
peace without addressing Palestinian rights to return to their
homeland and establish their state with East Jerusalem as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Syria also backed ''full Palestinian sovereignty'' over East
Jerusalem and suggested that there can be little concessions on the
Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's own negotiations with Israel were stalled earlier this
year over the scope of a proposed Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli
war.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 6, Reds 4  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY KINNEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Geoff Jenkins and Lou Collier homered as the
Milwaukee Brewers beat the Cincinnati Reds 6-4 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Collier, whose only previous homer this season had been for
Double-A Huntsville, hit a solo shot in the fourth inning off Ron
Villone (9-10). After Mark Loretta singled, Jenkins followed with a
two-run homer, his 27th of the season, to give Milwaukee a 6-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Haynes (12-12) gave up solo home runs to Pokey Reese in
the second inning and Sean Casey in the fifth. Haynes allowed four
runs on eight hits in 5 2-3 innings. He walked two and struck out
one.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Leskanic pitched the ninth for his 10th save in 11
chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds took a 1-0 lead in the first on an RBI single by Dmitri
Young.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee answered with three runs in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Jeromy Burnitz and Ron Belliard hit consecutive one-out singles,
and Raul Casanova walked to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Villone then walked pitcher Haynes, who was batting .127,
scoring Burnitz. Collier's sacrifice fly scored Belliard, and
Loretta doubled in Casanova. Villone allowed six runs on seven hits
in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati made it 3-2 on Reese's 12th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds added a run in the fifth on Casey's 15th homer and a
run in the sixth on Juan Castro's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Brewers are 18 games under .500, but are 57-31 when
they score at least four runs. ... Two Brewers outfielders have
double-digit assists. Jenkins has 12 and Burnitz has 10. ...
Marquis Grissom did not play Thursday after becoming the 65th
player to reach 400 stolen bases by stealing second in Milwaukee's
4-1 loss to the New York Mets. He's sixth among active players in
stolen bases. ... Reds executives Bill Doran and Tim Naehring are
swapping jobs. Naehring becomes director of player development and
Doran will be a special assistant to general manager Jim Bowden.
... Ken Griffey Jr., who has missed the last three games since
partially tearing his left hamstring Monday night, donated $10,000
worth of school supplies to the Boys &AMP; Girls Club of Greater
Cincinnati. The commissioner's office gave $1,000 and the School,
Home and Office Products Association added $5,000. ... Smoke
billowed from under an auxiliary press box as the game started, but
play was not affected. Stadium officials said some boxes caught
fire near a concession area, but the fire was quickly extinguished.

<HEADLINE> Bills QB Johnson Will Play Vs. Jets  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Bills quarterback Rob Johnson has
tendinitis in his right throwing elbow, but it should not prevent
him from playing this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had it for a while now. It's just something that I've had
to deal with,'' Johnson said on Thursday after he was wincing and
grabbing his arm while warming up in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've taken a couple of hits on my elbow. I've got some scabs
around it. It's been a little more tender than it has been before.
But I'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo travels to face the New York Jets on Sunday in a battle
of two 2-0 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the NFL's third-rated quarterback after two games this
season, has been sacked 10 times and taken heavy hits on numerous
other occasions. In two games, he's gone 27-for-44 for 360 yards,
thrown four touchdowns and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like Favre's but it's similar,'' said Bills coach
Wade Phillips, comparing Johnson to Green Bay quarterback Brett
Favre who is also playing with tendinitis in his throwing arm.
''Rob ices it down. He obviously didn't have any problem in the
game. It's a nagging type thing that he's gone through especially
since he's been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Flutie is still listed as the Bills third quarterback, not
fully recovered from a torn groin muscle he hurt in training camp,
while Alex Van Pelt is the team's backup.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Homes Face Mercury Threat  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES SHEEHAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- For the first time, city and gas company
officials say residences within Chicago may face the same problems
of mercury contamination plaguing suburban homes.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard M. Daley asked Peoples Energy for assurances that
approximately 30,000 homes in the city are not contaminated by
mercury after the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed a
substance found in a Chicago home was the potentially poisonous
substance.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said the substance at the home did not pose a health
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said there is no immediate cause for alarm, but the
discovery follows the revelation that more than 200,000 homes in
the Chicago suburbs may be at risk for contamination. The mercury
in the suburban homes was apparently spilled when old gas
regulators were replaced by the Nicor gas company.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago residences were not considered at risk because the city
never used gas lines that required the regulators.
</P>
<P>
   But three communities annexed by the city -- Edison Park,
Clearing and Mount Greenwood -- did have the gas lines and could
potentially face the same contamination risks.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury is a toxic metal that can damage the kidneys and brain
at certain levels of exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples Energy chief executive Richard Terry said the company
will begin visual examinations of the homes immediately, but could
not say when inspectors would be available for more thorough
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're starting with the visual right now and we're going to do
our very best to get a hold of testing equipment and follow up,''
Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   The company could face more problems in some northern suburbs
and a sizable portion of Lake County, where delivery systems also
use medium pressure lines.

bottled water contaminated with chemicals, and authorities were
trying to determine whether the cases were linked and involved
tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were sickened Thursday. The other incidents occurred
over the past few weeks and involved different brands of water,
according to the FBI, which is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions of the latest victims were not immediately known,
but the others have since recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani urged people to take precautions before
drinking bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make sure that you open the bottle yourself. And you actually
hear it, and you hear the noise and the air coming out,'' Giuliani
said Wednesday, adding that people should take a sniff before
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 3, a woman felt a burning sensation in her throat and
began bleeding from the mouth after drinking bottled water in a
restaurant. Tests on the water showed that it contained ''some type
of sodium hydroxide,'' a lye-type agent, Police Commissioner
Bernard Kerik said.
</P>
<P>
   A man who drank from a bottle of water purchased from a deli on
Aug. 27 felt a burning sensation in his throat. The water was found
to contain ammonia.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 6, a woman gave her 18-month-old son a sip of bottled
water purchased from a takeout restaurant. The baby became ill and
the water turned out also to be tainted with ammonia.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot draw the conclusion that the cases are linked,''
said Giuliani. ''It's too early to tell what kind of trend (is
occurring) or exactly what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Joseph Valiquette said his agency was told about
the contaminations by the health department on Sept.8 -- five days
before the mayor held a press conference announcing the possible
tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department spokeswoman Sandra Mullin said the department
suspected tampering on Sept. 6, but could not explain the delay in
informing top city officials or issuing public health warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mikulka, a musician from Manhattan who bought a bottle of
Poland Spring from a midtown Manhattan deli Thursday, said he would
not stop buying water from stores.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I'll just have to be more careful about checking the
safety wrapper,'' he said. ''I try not to worry about these things
too much.''

   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- John LeClair scored two goals as the
Philadelphia Flyers opened the exhibition season with a 4-2 victory
over the New York Islanders on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair, recently awarded a $7 million, one-year contract by an
arbitrator, beat former Flyers goalie John Vanbiesbrouck in the
first and second periods.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stevens, playing for the first time since his arrest in
January on drug charges, also scored for the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is still facing felony drug possession charges and
misdemeanor charges of soliciting a prostitute and possessing drug
paraphernalia in Illinois while a member of the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers played without Eric Desjardins, Mark Recchi and Brian
Boucher. Center Eric Lindros, who remains unsigned, is not in
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Tiley added a goal for Philadelphia, and Mariusz Czerkawski
and Mathieu Biron scored for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Vanbiesbrouck, traded to New York in the offseason after losing
his starting job to Boucher last season, made 27 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Maxime Ouellet, the Flyers' first-round draft pick in 1999,
stopped all 18 shots he faced after entering the game midway
through the second period.

<HEADLINE> Virginia executes man who raped, killed college student he dated  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BASKERVILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JARRATT, Va. (AP) - Derek R. Barnabei was executed Thursday
night for the rape and murder of a college girl he dated. Hours
earlier, the U.S. Supreme Court twice refused to grant a stay in
the case that was closely followed in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei, 33, a Somers Point, N.J., native, was put to death by
injection at the Greensville Correctional Center for the 1993
slaying of Sarah J. Wisnosky, a 17-year-old Old Dominion University
freshman. He was pronounced dead at 9:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am truly innocent of this crime,'' Barnabei said in a final
statement. ''Eventually, the truth will come out.'' Afterward, he
told his mother and brother he loved them, cited a passage from the
Bible and thanked three people who had taken an interest in his
case.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei was brought into the execution chamber at 8:54 p.m. He
glared at Virginia corrections director Ron Angelone, who was on a
red telephone linked to Gov. Jim Gilmore's office. Barnabei wore a
blue shirt, dungarees, white socks and blue shower slippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jim Gallagher, a Roman Catholic priest, spoke to
Barnabei briefly in the execution chamber and then entered the
witness booth, where he whispered prayers throughout the execution.
</P>
<P>
   The lethal chemicals began flowing into Barnabei's left arm at
9:02 p.m. Barnabei continued talking until his lip movement
suddenly stopped a few seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei had his final meal at 5:06 p.m., but prison officials,
at Barnabei's request, declined to reveal what he ate.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei was the sixth person executed in Virginia this year and
the 79th since 1982, when the state resumed executions after a
20-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   No family members of the victim attended the execution,
corrections officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 death penalty opponents conducted a candlelight vigil
outside the rural prison's main gate as the execution hour
approached. An almost equal number of Italian journalists were at
the prison to report on the execution.
</P>
<P>
   The three people thanked by Barnabei were Fabrizio Vigni, a
member of the Italian parliament who came to Virginia to meet with
Gilmore; Patrizia Mintz, an Italian woman writing a book about
Barnabei; and Tony DiPiazza, an Italian-American from New York who
offered a reward for anyone who found evidence that would exonerate
Barnabei.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei repeatedly said he was innocent. The case was closely
followed in Italy because he is Italian-American and that country
opposes the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Barnabei said: ''I don't want to die
and it's unjust that I die. If this is what God wants, then so be
it. I accept it. Who am I to question the ultimate design?''
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei's spiritual adviser, the Rev. Bob West, met with
Barnabei for about 90 minutes Thursday and said the condemned man
was ''ready to die.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's at peace, in great spirits,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Barnabei, Derek Barnabei's brother, described him as
''remarkably calm and at peace with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   At a final family meeting at the prison, Barnabei told his
brother and mother Jane to ''to go on with our lives and fight,''
Craig Barnabei said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope this is not for nothing,'' Craig Barnabei quoted his
brother as saying. ''I hope people take a hard look at my case.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei also wanted his body cremated, but his mother talked
him out of it, his brother said.
</P>
<P>
   After the face-to-face meeting, Barnabei talked to his mother,
who was staying at a nearby motel, by telephone for more than an
hour until some 25 minutes before he was brought into the execution
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours before the execution, Barnabei wrote out a will
by hand. Andy Protogyrou, one of Barnabei's attorneys, declined to
identify Barnabei's beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Barnabei's lawyers filed a clemency petition
with Gilmore, even though the governor had said Monday that he
would not grant clemency because new DNA testing confirmed Barnabei
was guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Serious doubts still surround this case,'' lawyer Seth A.
Tucker said in the petition filed Wednesday. He argued that
Barnabei should not be executed while a state police investigation
continues into a temporary disappearance of evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would do a disservice not only to Derek Barnabei, but also
to the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia, to continue with an
execution when there is still no conclusion as to who moved the
evidence, what they did with it, and why,'' Tucker wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore said Thursday that he is sure nobody tampered with the
evidence that was tested - Wisnosky's fingernail clippings, which
were in a sealed envelope that had not been opened.
</P>
<P>
   He also said plenty of other evidence was considered at trial
and in Barnabei's appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't retry cases in the governor's office,'' Gilmore told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's denial of two stay requests followed rulings
against Barnabei by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and U.S.
District Judge James Spencer in Richmond. The courts dismissed
defense arguments that the state tampered with evidence and that
more DNA testing should be done because some evidence disappeared
from Aug. 29 to Sept. 1 at the Norfolk Circuit Court clerk's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei had asked for DNA tests on some of that evidence -
genetic material on Wisnosky's fingernail clippings - in effort to
prove someone else committed the crime. Instead, the DNA tests
matched Barnabei.
</P>
<P>
   Wisnosky was last seen alive in Barnabei's room in a house he
shared with other young men in Norfolk. Her nude and beaten body
was found floating in the Lafayette River.

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Barnabei Vigils, 1st Ld-Writethru,640 	   Protesters rail against death penalty at vigils </HEADLINE>
By MARIA SANMINIATELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   JARRATT, Va. (AP) - Death penalty opponents said Derek R.
Barnabei was being put to death Thursday night for political gain
and that executions of criminals are themselves crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a human sacrifice, not for the sake of justice, but
for the sake of political gain,'' said Oliviero Toscani of New
York, an Italian citizen who has written extensively against the
death penalty in Talk magazine. ''Whoever has more condemned
inmates has more votes.''
</P>
<P>
   About 25 protesters carrying candles waited outside the
Greensville Correctional Center where Barnabei was put to death by
injection at 9 p.m. One carried a sign that said, ''Derek, we are
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie France McBirney, who lives in Norfolk, said she was
ashamed to live in a state that puts people to death.
</P>
<P>
   McBirney said she met Barnabei several years ago while doing
translation work for a French writer and began corresponding with
the inmate. ''He is very nice, an interesting and articulate
person. I am still convinced he's innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Vigils were held around the state Thursday as the execution hour
approached.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day in Charlottesville, protesters railed against
the cruelty of capital punishment and promised Gov. Jim Gilmore
they would not go away.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is America. We're supposed to be civilized. That's not
what I see,'' Ida Reid of Charlottesville told about 30 protesters
outside the local circuit court building.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said her brother, James Reid, has been brain-damaged since
a car accident 30 years ago, but he was still sent to death row for
the 1996 slaying of Annie Lester, a female acquaintance in
Montgomery County.
</P>
<P>
   Holding signs that bore slogans such as ''Life is sacred. Do not
kill,'' and ''An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind,'' some
protesters said the justice system is too unreliable and capital
punishment too brutal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone can get capital punishment one day and on a different
day, judge, and jury, he's acquitted,'' said Deborah Wyatt, a trial
attorney in Charlottesville. ''There's too much fallibility in the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt thinks public opinion is moving away from the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why are the European countries so ahead of us?'' she said.
''What's wrong with us?''
</P>
<P>
   Barnabei, who was denied two stay requests by the Supreme Court
on Thursday, has denied raping and killing 17-year-old Sarah J.
Wisnosky, an Old Dominion University freshman.
</P>
<P>
   But DNA tests released Monday showed that the blood on
fingernail clippings from the victim matched Barnabei.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a federal judge denied a stay for Barnabei and
dismissed arguments by his attorneys of ''deliberate and malicious
tampering'' by the state with evidence - including Wisnosky's
fingernail clippings - that were missing for two few days before
turning up and being tested.
</P>
<P>
   The material, along with other forensic evidence, disappeared
from a secure holding area in the Norfolk Circuit Court Clerk's
office late last month. After it was found in the office, Gov. Jim
Gilmore ordered an investigation into the disappearance. The
investigation is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why this cloud of secrecy?'' said Henry Heller, director of
Virginians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty. Heller pointed
out that members of Barnabei's defense were not allowed to witness
the testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are just taking the word of our governor, and I'm not
comfortable with that at all - that smacks of fascism,'' Heller
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are so many questions'' about the case, Heller said.
''This is not cut and dry and we're not being told the whole
story.''

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Greg Vanney scored on a penalty kick in the
61st minute as the Los Angeles Galaxy opened the MLS playoffs with
a 1-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Mutiny on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty kick was awarded after Tampa Bay's Steve Trittschuh
took down Luis Hernandez. Vanney converted five of six penalty
kicks during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles received three points for the victory under a new
playoff format. Game 2 of the quarterfinal series is Wednesday
night at the Rose Bowl. Game 3, if necessary, will be Saturday at
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay has lost seven straight playoff games, and hasn't
scored in 414 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which lost to D.C. United in last year's MLS final,
lost goalkeeper Kevin Hartman in the 39th minute with a concussion.
He was replaced by Matt Reis.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman appeared to hit his head against the goal post after
landing on the ground following a shot by Josh Keller in the 38th
minute. Tampa Bay's Steve Ralston also collided with Hartman early
in the half during a goalmouth scramble.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay had the better scoring chances during a scoreless
first half. Hartman made a diving deflection on Carlos Valderrama's
shot from 17 yards in the 18th minute, and Manny Lagos sent a
30-yard shot just wide in the 35th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy were without three starters -- Peter Vagenas, Sasha
Victorine and Danny Califf -- who are with the U.S. Olympic team.
Tampa Bay's Chad McCarty also is playing for the U.S. squad.

<HEADLINE> Aikman Not Sure of Playing Status  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Not even Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy
Aikman is sure of his playing status.
</P>
<P>
   After practicing for the second time since missing Sunday
night's game at Arizona because of a concussion, Aikman said he
felt good but didn't know if he would play Monday night at
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to be a little more committal on what I'm going to be
able to do ... I don't know. I really don't know,'' Aikman said
after practice Thursday. ''It's something we're taking a lot of
time in deciding and trying to make a decision on this thing and
it's not easy. It's not real clear-cut and black and white.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman suffered his ninth career concussion -- and third in 10
regular-season starts -- in the season-opening 41-14 loss to
Philadelphia. He missed two games last season after concussions in
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Thursday if he still had headaches or any other
lingering affects from the latest concussion, Aikman provided an
evasive answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not at liberty to discuss some of the things that I've
experienced or haven't experienced or where I'm at with all of
those things,'' Aikman said. ''Those are things being discussed
with the doctors, and that evaluation process is obviously the
reason why we haven't come to a clear-cut answer yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has split snaps in practice this week with Randall
Cunningham, who completed 24 of 34 passes for 243 yards and two
touchdowns Sunday night in Dallas' 32-31 loss to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, 33, admitted to treating this concussion differently
than others he has had.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's probably partly true and I think last year is what
initiated that,'' he said. ''I think because of what took place
last year is why there's extra caution. And then in addition to
that, probably my age and my stage in my career has instigated a
lot of this.''

<HEADLINE> Police seize 150 bombs from house  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEBSTER, N.Y. (AP) - Police removed 150 homemade bombs and 20
guns Thursday from a suburban house after evacuating neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Police staked out Jack Roessel's house after learning a company
had sent the man five pounds of potassium perchlorate, a chemical
that can be used in explosives, on Sept. 5. The federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms joined local and state police in the
raid Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Roessel, 41, is charged with two counts of criminal possession
of a weapon and first degree reckless endangerment, both class D
felonies.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were five kids within a tenth of a mile waiting to get
on a school bus,'' State Police Capt. Mark Fischer told the
Democrat and Chronicle of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Had the explosives detonated, with the equivalent power of 18
pounds of TNT, the children ''would have been killed,'' Fischer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Roessel probably didn't intend to hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''He tells us he likes to see things explode,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the guns found, p[olice recovered a AR-15 assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Roessel was jailed in lieu of $10,000 bail.

<HEADLINE> Bush Strikes at Gore on Fund Raising  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. (AP) -- George W. Bush, trying to regain the
offensive against Democratic rival Al Gore, said Thursday the vice
president ''may have crossed a serious line'' on campaign fund
raising, reviving questions about whether Gore can be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The appearance is really disturbing,'' Bush said by satellite
to a conference of the National Guard Association of the United
States. ''I will restore the bond of trust between the president
and all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in weeks, Bush was prodding Gore to react to
a controversy, rather than being thrown off-stride himself by
developments.
</P>
<P>
   Documents being reviewed by the Justice Department indicate Gore
was asked to make a fund-raising phone call in 1995 to a Texas
trial lawyer involved in tobacco industry litigation. The lawyer
and his firm later gave $790,000 to the Democratic Party after
President Clinton vetoed a bill to limit liability lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore aide said the vice president never made the phone call.
But Bush pounced on the issue, which recalled other queries into
such matters as Gore's fund raising at a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounded like on the surface there's a quid pro quo,'' Bush
said in an interview with KTTV-TV in Los Angeles, citing newspaper
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans are tired of investigations and scandal, and the
best way to get rid of them is to elect a new president who will
bring a new administration, who will restore honor and dignity to
the White House,'' Bush said to the National Guard group. ''I have
done so as governor of Texas. I will do so as president of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign said Bush was trying to distract voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Bush has become desperate,'' said Gore spokeswoman Kym
Spell. ''Instead of talking about the issues, Bush is dredging up
ancient allegations that have nothing to do with this election,
tired old personal attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had some distractions himself. After balking for weeks at a
three-debate proposal by Gore and the Commission on Presidential
Debates, Bush gave in Thursday and agreed to that plan.
</P>
<P>
   And spokeswoman Karen Hughes said a mystery package received
Wednesday by the Gore campaign was, indeed, authentic footage of
Bush practicing his debate style and strategy -- political gold if
his opponent had studied it. But the man who received it in the
mail, Gore adviser Tom Downey, said he didn't watch much of it and
instead turned it over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign clearly reveled in the chance to try to put Gore
on the defensive and to allow the Republican to focus on his own
issues rather than answering daily queries about messages buried in
ads or why Gore has gained in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Bush campaign released an ad intended to
complement a Republican National Committee spot assailing Gore on
Social Security, education and tax cuts. Called ''Compare,'' Bush's
ad is scheduled to run in 18 states beginning Friday, while the
party's spot began running Wednesday in seven states.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore? He says he wants to fight for the people against
HMOs, but his prescription drug plan forces seniors into one HMO
selected by the federal government,'' an announcer says in the
party ad.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Bush ad says Gore's plan ''forces seniors into a
government-run HMO.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than indulge reporters' questions about strategy, Bush
stuck to his subjects of choice in California, education reform and
military readiness. Polls show Gore ahead in the state, but Bush
says he is going to compete hard here.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to students at Santa Ana High School, he reiterated his
plan to make schools more accountable for student performance and
to give local and state governments more flexibility to spend
education money as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Students of this heavily Hispanic school peppered him with
questions on other topics, such as whether he supports the teaching
of sexual abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   He replied: ''I think it's very important for our children to
understand the power and promise of abstinence education.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping up his trip to California, Bush was stopping in New
Mexico on Friday before heading home to Texas for the weekend. He
was to visit battleground states in the Midwest and Florida next
week, including a stop in Chicago Tuesday for the Oprah Winfrey
Show and one in New York for the ''Live with Regis'' show on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> SWAT Team Kills 11-Year-Old Boy  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MODESTO, Calif. (AP) -- Authorities said a veteran SWAT team
member with a ''star record'' accidentally shot and killed an
11-year-old boy during a drug raid at his parents' home.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Sepulveda, a seventh-grader, was shot in the back
Wednesday when an officer accidentally fired his shotgun, Police
Chief Roy Wasden said. Alberto died on the floor of his bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the preliminary investigation, all indications so far is
that the shooting was accidental,'' Wasden said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   David Hawn, a 21-year department veteran and a SWAT team member
for more than 18 years, was placed on paid leave pending an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father, Moises Sepulveda, was arrested and booked on
charges of methamphetamine trafficking. The boy's mother and two
young siblings were also home during the raid.
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Agency said the raid had been part of a
nine-month investigation into methamphetamine trafficking and that
14 people had been arrested Wednesday during separate raids.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Van Winkle, a spokesman for the state Department of
Justice, which has 500 drug agents and investigators, said no
veterans he spoke with could recall any other accidental shooting
of children during previous drug raids.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hawn was cleared of wrongdoing for misfiring his gun
into a suspect who had already killed himself during a SWAT raid.
An internal investigation concluded an attacking pitbull brushed
the muzzle of Hawn's gun as he and other officers were checking the
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a star record,'' his chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Sepulveda Jr., 14, was on the top bunk bed above his
brother when the SWAT team banged on the door. He said he does not
know if his brother was awake when he left the room.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father said to stay calm. Then the front door blew open and
they threw out one of those smoke bombs,'' the teen-ager said,
pointing to the brown scorch mark left on the living room floor by
the canister
</P>
<P>
   ''My dad was cuffed and I was cuffed and one of them was
stepping on my neck, pointing a gun down at me and told me not to
move,'' he said. ''I heard another blast and thought it was another
smoke bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it turns out they shot my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Sepulveda Jr., echoing the feelings of neighbors, relatives and
other community members, said he didn't understand why
investigators did not try to enter peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would have opened the door,'' he said. ''My dad isn't the
kind of man who would put his family in jeopardy.''

U.S.Deploys Warship in East Timor
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- U.S. Navy ships and Marine troops arrived in East
Timor waters Thursday to counter any threat by militia gangs against an aid
mission on the devastated island, a military spokesman said. Last week, militias
killed three U.N. aid workers in neighboring West Timor and other gangs have
killed two U.N. peacekeepers in East Timor in recent clashes. Marine spokesman
Lt. Jeff Landis said about 4,000 troops arrived aboard four U.S. ships. The
vessels were carrying tons of building materials and food for the island
territory. The ships will leave East Timor on Saturday.

Poll: 3 in 10 Voters Not Sure Yet
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About three in 10 voters, many of them independents, have
not firmly decided whether to vote for Al Gore or George W. Bush, and that could
keep the race competitive for weeks, a new poll suggests. The survey, coming at
a time that Democrat Gore has been edging ahead in some polls and seeming to
gain momentum in key states, indicates there are plenty of voters still weighing
which candidate they like on the issues and which they trust personally. Some of
the key demographic groups are younger women, older men, Catholics, mainstream
Protestants and parents, according to the poll released today by the Pew
Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press.

   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- A pro-government militia said Thursday that it had
killed nearly 100 Rwandan soldiers and six white mercenaries in eastern Congo.
The claim from the Mai-Mai militia came a day after a rebel leader declared an
offensive on the militia, after the Mai-Mai group killed 15 civilians in eastern
Congo. A statement from Mai-Mai leader Gen. Padiri Kalendo, read on state
television, said his forces killed 93 Rwandans and six mercenaries in the

Scientists Alter Gene in Mouse

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have found a way to produce mice with genes
that can be switched on and off, a development that could speed up the
laboratory study of genes and their effect on disease. In a study appearing
tomorrow in the journal Science, researchers at Oregon Health Sciences
University in Portland report that they altered a target gene in mouse embryos
so that a special protein was triggered when the mice were fed an antibiotic.
When the mice were grown, the researchers showed that feeding the animals an
antibiotic would cause the gene to shut down. The gene could be turned back on,
the researchers said, when the antibiotic was removed from the diet of the
animals.

<HEADLINE> Drugs an Issue as Olympics Begin  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN CANFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- As preparations for the Sydney Olympics
entered their final hours, a prestigious science journal questioned
drug-testing efforts and a royal member of the International
Olympics Committee said the games may never be drug free.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the Thursday issue of Nature said some athletes
will still be able to get away with using human growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the scientists developing the tests are confident
that they could have been readied in time for Sydney, the IOC
refused to sanction funding for the necessary validation studies,''
the journal said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a result, unscrupulous athletes know that they can abuse
hGH with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Princess Anne, president of the British Olympic Association and
an International Olympic Committee member, said the temptation for
world-class athletes to gain an edge by taking
performance-enhancing drugs would always be too great.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will never defeat it entirely,'' she said in an interview
with Britain's ITN. ''It is a problem that will always be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Human growth hormone, which was designed to treat dwarfism, is
used by some athletes to build muscle. In January 1999, a
consortium headed by London endocrinologist Peter Sonksen told the
IOC it had found a ''very credible test'' for hGH.
</P>
<P>
   Sonksen said validation studies would cost about $5 million,
which the IOC called too high and declined to fund.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also found flaws in the IOC's tests for EPO, a
hormone that raises the level of oxygen-carrying red blood cells
and is favored by endurance athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ''But few athletes (taking EPO) are likely to be caught out at
the games,'' the article said. ''Provided they stop taking EPO a
few days before their events, they will probably test negative.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said an athlete can take EPO up to a few days
before competition and still test negative in a urine sample. Even
a positive blood test would not mean punishment since the IOC
requires two failed tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the International Olympic Committee and other sports
governing bodies do not provide more funding to back their tough
words on drugs ... scientists say they will continue to be
runners-up in the doping contest,'' the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   German swimmer Franziska van Almsick, winner of three medals at
the Atlanta Olympics, questioned the will of sports to control
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have the impression that not everybody 100 percent wants
something to be done about it,'' she told the financial daily
Handelsblatt.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Calls Jones' Situation Unfair  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Carl Lewis, winner of nine Olympic gold
medals, thinks that Marion Jones never should be in the position of
trying to win five golds at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfair that her camp or her people put her in that
situation -- to have to run two relays,'' Lewis said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is attempting to win golds in the 100 and 200 meters, 400
and 1,600 relays and the long jump. The two relays will be
contested on the final full day of track and field, and Jones is
inexperienced at running the long relay.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis can empathize with her. He went for four golds in 1984, in
the 100 and 200, 400 relay and long jump, and won them all.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a lot easier for me because it was in Los Angeles,''
Lewis said. ''I knew the city well. We just parked ourselves
somewhere and drove to the stadium. Things were totally different
in Barcelona (in 1992) and in Seoul (in 1988). It's nice when
you're able to navigate around and the people speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is much hype surrounding Jones' bold bid, Lewis said
his record-equalling attempt ''wasn't that big a deal going in.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to keep life simple,'' he said. ''If I trained hard
every day, I knew I would be OK. Coach (Tom) Tellez had a plan and
I just followed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his try to match Jesse Owens' four golds in the same
events at the 1936 Berlin Games also received widespread publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was strange being on the cover of magazines for nine
months,'' Lewis said. ''After the first couple of weeks, I didn't
go to the store.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was strange seeing 'Car and Driver' and there was someone
staring at you. Very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis admitted that his life changed considerably after his
remarkable achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of 1983, a lot of people recognized me,'' he said.
''After 1984, everybody recognized me.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mind all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ninety-nine percent of the people were nice to me,'' he said.
''They were very polite. It's different, but you adjust. It's part
of the maturation process. There's no better learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was only 23. I was just a baby then.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis won't make any predictions on how Jones, 24, will fare.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to put any pressure on her,'' he said. ''It's not
fair. There's too much pressure.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls Iraqi Flight Provocation  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time in more than a decade, at
least one Iraqi fighter jet flew over Saudi Arabia airspace last
week, a senior U.S. official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Iraq's purpose may
have been to confront the United States during the U.N. Millennium
Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put pressure on President Saddam Hussein, she met for
50 minutes with eight Iraqi opponents of his rule and discussed
trying to build a legal case against him, possibly with the
formation of a war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States salutes the courage of Iraqis everywhere in
the opposition,'' Albright said in a statement. ''I wish them
success in presenting to the world the true hopes and needs of the
Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright warned Iraq, meanwhile, that if it rebuilt its arsenal
of weapons of mass destruction or otherwise crossed U.S. ''red
lines,'' it risked a U.S. attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a credible force in the region and we are prepared to
use it at a time and place of our choosing,'' she said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   With exceptional anger, Albright rejected Iraqi claims that
Kuwait was stealing its oil.
</P>
<P>
   ''I genuinely have trouble believing one word out of the mouth
of any Iraqi official,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Albright ridiculed any suggestion that U.N.
sanctions were denying food to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   She said oil revenues were so high ''they import 12,000 cases of
scotch each year.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not sure if this is food or medicine,'' Albright added.
</P>
<P>
   There was no response to the Iraqi incursion from U.S. or
British planes, which were taking a day off from patrolling the
''no fly'' zone over southern Iraq, but coalition aircraft attacked
an Iraqi radar facility on Thursday, defense officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said there
were two Iraqi planes over southern Iraq on Sept. 4, but he
pointedly declined to confirm the incursion into Saudi airspace,
saying any comment on that would have to come from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley declined to speculate on what Iraq's motivation might
have been for the flights, but he said this time of year regularly
brings increased Iraqi actions and nothing has occurred to indicate
a seriously heightened threat in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were not looking for a fight with coalition aircraft,''
he said, noting that the Iraqis know when there are no U.S. or
British planes in the air.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's attack, Quigley said U.S. and British planes all
returned safely after bombing the facility, which is part of Iraq's
air defense system. He said damage assessments were still being
made.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the United States and Iraq have been on the
rise, mostly over a renewed attempt to have U.N. inspectors go to
Iraq to look for hidden weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Albright said the United States would back
vigorous diplomacy with a threat of force to preserve stability
through the Middle East and Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   While Albright did not identify the potential targets in a
speech to a Jewish group, a senior U.S. official said the United
States would take military action if Iraq rebuilt its arsenals of
dangerous weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the United States and Britain conducted
airstrikes to punish Iraq for refusing to cooperate with weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The administration evidently is not looking for another
confrontation with Saddam over inspections. But Albright's
reference to ''red lines'' appears to indicate the United States
could use force if Iraq crosses those unspecified lines.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate warning, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
said he had told Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz it would be
''a very serious mistake'' to expect any weakening of the Security
Council determination to send U.N. inspectors back to Iraq.

   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona State quarterback Ryan Kealy,
suspended indefinitely after being arrested for driving under the
influence of drugs, was reinstated Thursday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rangers 8, Royals 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Rookie Doug Davis allowed three hits in
7 1-3 innings and Rafael Palmeiro hit his 36th homer of the season,
leading the Texas Rangers over the Kansas City Royals 8-1 Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's homer, which tied the score in the first, was his
397th, moving him past Joe Carter and into 34th on the career list,
one behind Dale Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Texas broke the game open in the eighth on two-run homers by
Chad Curtis and Gabe Kapler off reliever Paul Spoljaric. It was
Curtis' second career pinch-hit homer.
</P>
<P>
   Davis (7-5) walked four in the first three innings, five in all,
but none turned into runs. He retired 12 straight before a one-out
walk in the eighth to Johnny Damon, his final hitter. Tim Crabtree
pitched the final 1 2-3 innings for his second save in eight
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Suzuki (8-10) allowed four runs and five hits in 6 1-3
innings. He matched his career high with eight strikeouts and
walked six.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Beltran's sacrifice fly put Kansas City ahead in the
first after Rey Sanchez and Mike Sweeney singled, and Jermaine Dye
walked.
</P>
<P>
   After Palmerio's homer tied it, the Rangers went ahead in the
third. Luis Alicea doubled, Palmeiro was intentionally walked with
one out, and Kapler walked to load the bases. Suzuki then walked
rookie Pedro Valdes on a 3-2 pitch, forcing in the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto reached first on second baseman Carlos Febles'
fielding error in the seventh and Palmeiro walked. Kapler singled
in a run off Suzuki, and pinch-hitter Ruben Sierra singled in a run
off Scott Mullen.
</P>
<P>
Notes: X-rays showed Texas C Ivan Rodriguez's broken right thumb
is healing on schedule. Rodriguez will have the split removed from
the thumb and he has been cleared to begin range-of-motion
exercises. Rodriguez sustained the season-ending injury on July 24.
... The Royals fell to 14-26 against the AL West this season ...
Suzuki's has had eight strikeouts five times in his career.

<P>
   Florence probably will resume an eastward track by early Friday
toward Bermuda, where the island's weather service issued a storm
watch Thursday. Florence was briefly a hurricane Tuesday before
degenerating to a tropical storm Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Florence could brush Bermuda with tropical storm-force winds and
give it drenching rains and a pounding surf by Friday evening, said
forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it follows the forecast track, then they will be right on
the edge,'' said Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist. ''They
could get wind gusts of up above 40 miles per hour.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT, Florence, still nearly stationary, was centered
near latitude 29.2 north, longitude 73.0 west, or about 535 miles
west-southwest of Bermuda. Moving southeast at nearly 3 mph,
Florence had maximum sustained winds reaching 45 mph. It was
expected to begin trekking eastward by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The depression off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula in the western
Caribbean could remain over the peninsula before entering the
south-central Gulf of Mexico sometime Friday, said Eric Blake, a
hurricane center meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   If the center survives the trip over the Yucatan - and it's
small enough that it may not survive - intensification into a
tropical storm is likely over the warm waters of the Gulf of
Mexico, Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was too early to know which track the depression would
take if it makes it into the Gulf, Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane hunter aircraft flew into the depression Thursday
morning and found its center near latitude 20.0 north and longitude
87.5 west, moving to the northwest near 10 mph with sustained winds
near 30 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rip currents associated with Florence and blamed for
at least two surf deaths Tuesday in North Carolina were expected to
continue. Rescue workers searched a second day for a 23-year-old
man missing after falling out of a kayak, but did not find him.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they do not intend to reopen the two beaches
until Florence is no longer a threat.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 3, Yankees 2, 11 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jose Cruz Jr. hit a two-run homer in the 11th
inning as the Toronto Blue Jays beat the New York Yankees 3-2
Thursday night despite David Wells again failing to become the
first 20-game winner in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   In a pitchers' duel full of postseason intensity, Wells and Andy
Pettitte matched zeros for seven innings, yet neither was around
when the game was decided.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 1-all, Carlos Delgado led off the 11th with a
walk against Randy Choate (0-1). Two outs later, Cruz hit a drive
into the wind in left field. Luis Polonia backed up to the wall,
leaped, but the ball just cleared his glove for Cruz's 30th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz joined Delgado, Tony Batista and Brad Fullmer with 30
homers, making Toronto and this year's Anaheim Angels as the only
AL teams with four 30-homer hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch (8-3) pitched two innings for the win and Kelvim
Escobar pitched the 11th for his second save, allowing a one-out
homer to Ryan Thompson. The Blue Jays moved within three games of
wild card leader Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who allowed eight hits and no walks in eight innings,
failed for the third time to reach 20 wins for the first time in
his career. He got knocked out in the second inning against Oakland
on Sept. 4, and Koch blew a 5-4 lead in the ninth for Wells last
Saturday against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   After Pettitte's throwing error led to an unearned run in the
top of the eighth, Wells appeared to be on his way to winning No.
20 in his favorite stadium and in front of the fans who adored him
during his two years in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Derek Jeter tied the game in the bottom half when hit a shot
over the center-field fence for his 14th homer. Wells slapped in
disgust as plate umpire Angel Hernandez threw out a new ball,
watching another chance at 20 wins go by. Wells probably will get
three more starts.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, going for his 100th career win, didn't allow a runner
past first base until Craig Grebeck led off the eighth with a
double. Alberto Castillo then bunted back to Pettitte who wheeled
and threw to third. The wild throw sailed into left field, scoring
pinch-runner Dewayne Wise and sending Castillo to second on the
error.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Stewart followed with another bunt to Pettitte, who
struggled to pick the ball up before throwing to first. The throw
appeared to beat Stewart, but umpire Marty Foster called him safe,
sending manager Joe Torre barreling out of the dugout. Torre was
ejected in the argument.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte left after a sacrifice bunt by Alex Gonzalez, and Mike
Stanton got out of the jam without additional damage. Pettitte
allowed four hits in 7 1-3 innings, striking out nine.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees nearly lost it in the 10th when reliever Jeff Nelson
made a boneheaded play on a bunt. With a runner on first and one
out, Gonzalez popped it back to Nelson, who let the ball drop to
try for a double play. Nelson threw to first, and the speedy
Stewart to reach second without a play.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson recovered to strike out Dave Martinez and sprinted back
to the dugout in relief.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wells walked none in 13 of 32 starts. ... Wells is 28-9
with a 3.27 ERA in his career at Yankee Stadium. ... Jeter singled
in the first and has reached base safely in 39 straight games -- the
longest active streak in the majors. ... Delgado, third in the AL
with 39 homers, went 1-for-4 with three strikeouts and has a
15-game homerless stretch -- tied for his longest of the season. ...
Torre has been ejected twice this season.

<HEADLINE> Drugs, as Always, an Olympic Issue  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN CANFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- As preparations for the Olympics
entered their final hours, a prestigious science journal questioned
drug-testing efforts and a royal member of the IOC said the games
may never be drug free.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the Thursday issue of ''Nature'' said some
athletes will still get away with using human growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the scientists developing the tests are confident
that they could have been readied in time for Sydney, the IOC
refused to sanction funding for the necessary validation studies,''
the journal said. ''As a result, unscrupulous athletes know that
they can abuse hGH with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Princess Anne, president of the British Olympic Association and
an International Olympic Committee member, said the temptation for
world-class athletes to gain an edge through performance-enhancing
drugs would always be too great.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will never defeat it entirely,'' she said in an interview
with Britain's ITN. ''It is a problem that will always be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois Carrard, IOC director general, said that as of Friday,
the IOC had conducted 269 out-of-competition tests and 149 controls
for the hormone EPO, with no positive results. EPO raises the level
of oxygen-carrying red blood cells and is favored by endurance
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Romanian delegation withdrew weightlifter Traian
Ciharean from the competition following reports he was caught
doping. Media reports said Ciharean tested positive for a
prohibited substance in an out-of-competition test in July. No
further details were available.
</P>
<P>
   Human growth hormone, which was designed to treat dwarfism, is
used by some athletes to build muscle. In January 1999, a
consortium headed by London endocrinologist Peter Sonksen told the
IOC it had found a ''very credible test'' for hGH.
</P>
<P>
   Sonksen said validation studies would cost about $5 million,
which the IOC called too high and declined to fund.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also found flaws in the IOC's tests for EPO, saying
any athlete who stopped taking EPO a few days before their event
''will probably test negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a positive blood test would not mean punishment since the
IOC requires two failed tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the International Olympic Committee and other sports
governing bodies do not provide more funding to back their tough
words on drugs ... scientists say they will continue to be
runners-up in the doping contest,'' the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, head of the White House drug office and a
critic of drug-testing methods in sports, said he isn't satisfied
with the EPO test but that, ''It's a valid effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The current test will have an ''enormously reassuring effect on
the many honest athletes who wanted to come here and compete,''
McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   German swimmer Franziska van Almsick, winner of three medals at
the Atlanta Olympics, questioned the will of sports to control
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have the impression that not everybody 100 percent wants
something to be done about it,'' she told the financial daily
Handelsblatt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the coach of the Chinese rowing team insisted his
athletes have not used EPO, even though seven members failed the
test. Zhang Quing suggested traditional medicines might be to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   He said if Chinese authorities had used the combined blood and
urine test being employed at Sydney to check for use of the
performance-enhancing substance, all of his rowers would have been
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ''They definitely did not use EPO,'' Zhang said Thursday. ''If
they had used the full EPO tests, not one of our athletes would
have been positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The rowers were dropped after the blood test, which Zhang said
showed they had above-normal red blood-cell counts. In all, China
dropped 27 athletes, most for failing blood tests for EPO.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang said nutritional supplements might have affected the
tests. He also said some rowers take Chinese medicines typically
given to women after childbirth to boost their blood cell counts.
</P>
<P>
   A Greek athlete who was stopped Saturday for carrying a natural
drug that is banned in Australia arrived in Sydney to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Triple jump champion Stamatis Lenis, 22, and coach Stavrou
Zougouridis were stopped by customs officers in Perth for carrying
the natural Russian drug Ekdisten.
</P>
<P>
   Tests conducted in Canberra revealed the drug contained
Ecdysterone, a natural substance used to aid an athlete's recovery.
The drug is outlawed in Australia but isn't banned by the IOC as a
performance-enhancing drug.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek team announced that Lenis had been given the go-ahead
to compete.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 4, Cubs 0  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The closer the St. Louis Cardinals get to the
postseason, the better Pat Hentgen gets.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen (15-10) pitched a three-hitter for his first shutout in
more than three years in a 4-0 victory over the Chicago Cubs on
Thursday night. He struck out a season-high nine and walked none
for his 10th career shutout, and first since June 20, 1997 against
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think he's a big-game guy,'' catcher Mike Matheny said.
''Things are real exciting around here and I think he's the kind of
guy who just swells up and comes up with a little better stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen (15-10) won for the fifth time in six decisions. He
allowed singles by Shane Andrews in the second and seventh innings
and a leadoff double by Ricky Gutierrez in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   He has 31 complete games, the last coming Aug. 12, 1999 in a 3-0
loss to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hentgen was fabulous,'' said the Cubs' Mark Grace. ''Our guy
threw pretty good, but if he didn't throw a shutout he wasn't going
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals manager Tony La Russa is considering a three-man
rotation for the playoffs, and for a long time Hentgen was likely
the odd man out behind Darryl Kile, Garrett Stephenson and Andy
Benes. Hentgen, who gave the Cardinals three 15-game winners for
the first time since 1985, doesn't appear to care.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no control over that,'' he said. ''Tony's going to make
that decision and when I'm asked to pitch I'm going to go out and
try my best.''
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew and Craig Paquette homered for the Cardinals, who won
their fourth straight and opened a season-high, 11-game lead. St.
Louis, which last won the division in 1996, reduced its magic
number to five over second-place Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think guys smell it,'' Hentgen said. ''They know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Quevedo (2-9) gave up all four runs -- three earned -- and
five hits in six innings. It was a major improvement over his
previous two outings, he allowed 13 runs in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was one of the better games he's pitched,''
manager Don Baylor said. ''He had a blister and he got through it.
He kept us in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew's homer with two outs in the fifth was the 200th at Busch
Stadium this season, a high for the 34-year-old park. The previous
high was 196 in 1998, the year Mark McGwire hit a record 70 homers.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who was listed as a starter in all six of the
Cardinals' game on the just-completed trip just so he could bat in
the first inning, did not play.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa was 0-for-4 with two strikeouts as the Cubs lost for
the 12th time in 15 games. Sosa is 2-for-26 against St. Louis this
year with a pair of homers.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Cubs' first game in St. Louis since April 3-6, when
the Cardinals had a three-game sweep and outscored them 30-8 with
nine homers.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis took a 2-0 lead in the third on an RBI single by
Placido Polanco and a run-scoring error by Andrews at third.
</P>
<P>
   After Drew's homer, Paquette homered in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cardinals are a season-high 25 games above .500. ...
The game was played with a three-man umpiring crew minus Mark
Wegner, scheduled to work second base. Wegner missed the game for
personal reasons. ... Dennis DeYoung, the former front man of one
of Tony La Russa's favorite bands, Styx, threw out the ceremonial
first pitch. ... Cardinals LF Ray Lankford missed the game with a
slightly injured right hamstring and may be out until Sunday. ''It
just grabbed a little on me,'' Lankford said. ... Cubs 2B Eric
Young left after the top of the fourth with tightness in his right
quadriceps. ... The crowd of 41,493 was the Cardinals' 29th
sellout.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Setting a new standard for dullness,
the U.S. men's basketball team fidgeted, fussed and flung out
endless cliches at its inaugural news conference at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt that this team is not the Dream Team,
that point was driven home relentlessly Friday (Thursday night EDT)
in a gathering with the international media that might have been
the most mind-numbing 35 minutes in Australian history.
</P>
<P>
   Flirting with the all-time Olympic record for use of the phrase
''it's a tremendous honor,'' the U.S. team did nothing to dispel
the notion that they are boring and nobody cares about them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to step on the floor every night and get the job
done,'' said the team's biggest star, Vince Carter.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, none of the players was seen yawning.
</P>
<P>
   They slumped forward, they slumped backward. They drank water,
they tried on headphones and listened to different translations of
their, um, insight.
</P>
<P>
   The stretched their necks, they rubbed their eyes, they fiddled
with pens, they giggled among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived 15 minutes late and left 10 minutes early, and no
one even considered complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys are a lot different from the '96 guys,'' said Gary
Payton, the only holdover from the men's basketball team that won
the gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics. ''They are younger guys,
more athletic guys.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not, however, more interesting guys.
</P>
<P>
   They are not like the 1992 team, a star-studded crew that
included Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and John
Stockton. That team inspired awe.
</P>
<P>
   They are not like the 1996 team, a veteran cast that included
funnymen Charles Barkley, Reggie Miller and Shaquille O'Neal. That
team at least knew how to lighten the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   This team features the likes of Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Antonio
McDyess, Ray Allen and Allan Houston. They all seem like good guys,
they all have a good sense of humor, they all have a flair for
showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   They just don't know how to show it, a point that was
illuminated Friday as brightly as the glare radiating off of
assistant coach Gene Keady's head.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team begins Olympic play Sunday night against China.
Other preliminary opponents are Italy, Lithuania, New Zealand and
France.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the best teams from the rest of the world, including
Yugoslavia, Australia and Canada, are grouped in the other bracket.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans might not have a compelling game until the
Olympics are almost over.
</P>
<P>
   ''People that love basketball are in for a treat,'' assistant
coach Larry Brown said. ''These guys play the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, the world wants something more.
</P>
<P>
   And this U.S. team didn't provide it as they were introduced to
the world.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 7, Indians 4  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Pedro Martinez can't be intimidated by taunts,
boos or death threats. And as far as the Cleveland Indians are
concerned, Martinez can't be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez did it to Cleveland once again Thursday night, allowing
four hits in seven innings to remain undefeated in his career
against the Indians in leading the Boston Red Sox to a 7-4 win.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the MVP of this team,'' Dante Bichette said. ''He's so
valuable I don't think it can even be measured. He's the most
dominating pitcher that I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (17-5) improved to 7-0 in seven regular-season starts
against the Indians. He's also 2-0 against Cleveland in the
postseason, and has been branded Public Enemy No. 1 around Jacobs
Field.
</P>
<P>
   There was beefed up security for the series finale after
Martinez revealed on Wednesday that his life had been threatened
while warming up for Game 5 of the playoffs last season.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he got the same treatment as he got ready for this
start.
</P>
<P>
   ''They called me trash,'' he said. ''They said I stunk. So I
guess it was just another day at the office.''
</P>
<P>
   That it was.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was making his first appearance at Jacobs Field since
April 30, when he hit Roberto Alomar with a pitch, earning a
five-game suspension. He buzzed a couple of hitters, but baseball's
best pitcher zeroed in on the strike zone when he needed to.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out 10, including the side in the third and
seventh, when the Indians put two on with none out.
</P>
<P>
   ''A guy like Pedro doesn't bend under the pressure,'' Bichette
said. ''He just puts a 97 mph fastball on the outside corner.
That's why he's Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Indians were in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the same Pedro, hitting spots, beautiful,'' shortstop
Omar Vizquel said. ''Seeing that guy on the mound is like watching
Manny (Ramirez) hitting. Unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett went 4-for-5 with a two-run homer and Bichette
homered off Charles Nagy (2-5) as the Red Sox moved within two
games of the Indians, who lead the AL wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to Cleveland, Boston lost three of four games to
the New York Yankees, putting its season on the brink. But just
like last year's Red Sox, this group is showing it can come back,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ''It says that we are warriors and we don't give up,'' Martinez
said. ''We've battled back the whole season. We're known to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   David Segui hit a two-run homer and an RBI single for the
Indians, who play five games at Fenway Park next week, including
back-to-back doubleheaders.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe got four outs for his 34th save, his second of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's two-run homer capped Boston's four-run sixth, with the
Red Sox scoring all their runs with two outs. The Indians had a
chance to get out of the inning, but first baseman Jim Thome
couldn't come up with Trot Nixon's hard smash.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox scored their other runs in the inning on a wild
pitch by reliever Justin Speier and Nomar Garciaparra's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Segui's homer in the fifth gave the Indians their first earned
runs in 32 1-3 innings against Martinez, who had not allowed
Cleveland to score since Sept. 15 last season, a span that includes
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just so tough. I've never had an easy at-bat against
him,'' Segui said. ''You go up there thinking to just make contact,
but he throws so hard. It's easy to say what to do and real hard to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez retired the first 13 hitters so easily, it looked like
he might be on his way to finally pitching the no-hitter that has
somehow eluded him.
</P>
<P>
   Thome became Cleveland's first runner, drawing Martinez's lone
walk before Segui hit his sixth homer since coming to the Indians
in a July trade.
</P>
<P>
   Segui had been 3-for-24 with 11 strikeouts against Martinez
before connecting.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Indians manager Charlie Manuel said his
scouting reports showed that Martinez hadn't been topping 92 mph on
the radar gun recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''He may not be able to blow the ball by us like he used to,''
Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez's fastball hit 98 mph several times in the third,
when he needed 16 pitches to fan Travis Fryman, Russell Branyan and
Sandy Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette put the Red Sox ahead 3-0 in the fourth with his fourth
homer since coming to Boston in an Aug. 31 trade from Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy, making his first start since undergoing elbow surgery in
May, fell behind 1-0 in the first when Everett reached on an
infield single and Garciaparra followed with a double.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's wind-blown RBI double made it 2-0 in the third.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Everett's steal of second in the fifth was just Boston's
39th steal this season. Only Oakland, which has 35, has fewer in
the majors. ... Indians manager Charlie Manuel was ejected in the
seventh inning by third-base umpire Eric Cooper, who called Jim
Thome out on a checked-swing. ... The Indians added security
personnel around the Boston dugout and bullpen in response to
Martinez saying he received a death threat while warming up in last
year's playoffs. ... Martinez has 15 double-digit strikeout games
this season. He had 19 last year.

<HEADLINE> One hurt when police boat smashes rowing scull  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - A 13-year-old was seriously
injured Thursday afternoon when the rowing scull she was in was
struck by a police patrol boat.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the Saratoga County Sheriff's boat piloted by
Deputy Richard Lawrence was moving fast over Saratoga Lake when it
struck the rowing scull broadside at 4:35 p.m. Nine junior high and
high school girls were aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the area where the accident happened was
posted as a ''no-wake zone'' to slow boats down.
</P>
<P>
   Maya Hensley-Lapham, the most seriously injured, was being
treated at Albany Medical Center Hospital for a broken pelvis and
broken ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Witness Dave Bronner said it was lucky more people weren't hurt.
The 63-foot long boat was broken in half.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really dodged a big bullet out on Saratoga Lake today,''
Bronner told The Saratogian. ''I can't believe the propeller on
that big outboard motor didn't get those girls. There was Fiberglas
all over the place. He was really moving.''
</P>
<P>
   State Park Police are investigating the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Falvo, 13, the coxswain aboard the scull, said she had
the rowers change course to try to avoid the collision. She thinks
Lawrence saw her but too late to change direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he saw me, he turned really hard, but it was too late,''
she said. ''He was going too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The glare of the sun may have played a role in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga Springs is 30 miles north of Albany.

<HEADLINE> Ex-San Francisco Mayor Dies  </HEADLINE>
By RON HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- George Christopher, the former San
Francisco mayor who persuaded the New York Giants to move to the
West Coast, died Thursday of a stroke. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher was the city's 34th mayor and served in office from
1956-64. He was the last Republican mayor of San Francisco and
retired from politics arena after finishing behind Ronald Reagan in
the 1966 California governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher's tenure as mayor was highlighted when he convinced
the New York Giants to move to San Francisco after the 1957 season.
He was also instrumental in getting Candlestick Park built amid the
chilly, swirling winds along the San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   He was teased later by colleagues about the poor weather
conditions at Candlestick Point, but Christopher was remembered
fondly Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''San Francisco has suffered a monumental loss following this
morning's death of former mayor George Christopher,'' current mayor
Willie Brown said in a statement. ''George was a dear friend and he
will be deeply missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Born George Christopheles in Arcadia, Greece on Dec. 8, 1907,
Christopher was brought to San Francisco when he was 2 years old.
He went on to earn a degree in accounting from the Golden Gate
Night College and became a citizen of the United States in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher began his political career serving on the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1945. Ten years later he was
elected mayor by the largest majority in the city's history at that
time.
</P>
<P>
   During Christopher's mayoral terms, Fortune Magazine called San
Francisco ''one of the best administered cities in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has ordered the city's flags flown at half-staff to
commemorate Christopher's life.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Basketball Program Probed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Federal investigators are trying to determine
whether academic cheating in Minnesota's basketball program
occurred before a former tutor did coursework for players, the
Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Gangelhoff revealed in March 1999 that she wrote more than
400 research papers and tests for about 20 players. WCCO-TV
reported Wednesday night that she will plead guilty to a federal
charge of misappropriating funds.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the plea, Gangelhoff will testify against former
coach Clem Haskins and former basketball academic counselor Alonzo
Newby, WCCO reported. In a follow-up report Thursday night, the
station quoted sources as saying investigators are considering
prosecuting Haskins and Newby on more than a dozen felony counts
each.
</P>
<P>
   The station did not identify its sources for the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators now are looking into Haskins' role in the alleged
mail fraud, wire fraud and misappropriation of Pell Grant funds to
determine when the fraud began.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they are trying to set a foundation and I think they
are looking at coach Haskins' entire tenure,'' said Anne White, who
tutored basketball players 10 years ago and said she was
interviewed by investigators this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they were trying to establish a pattern, when did it
spiral out of control, a starting point. I couldn't give them a
starting point. I was never asked to do anything unethical by the
students or the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the federal inquiry, Gangelhoff's revelation has
led to the departure of Haskins and two top administrators,
university-imposed sanctions and an NCAA investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the university sued Haskins to recover the $1.5
million it paid to buy out his contract, saying the coach lied when
he denied giving $3,000 to Gangelhoff and that he told players to
mislead investigators after the scandal broke. Haskins' attorney
said the university's allegations are false.
</P>
<P>
   Gangelhoff has agreed to plead guilty as early as Friday to one
felony count related to federal grant money given to former guard
Bobby Jackson and to testify before a grand jury, WCCO reported.
Prosecutors will argue that by doing Jackson's work, Gangelhoff
enabled him to collect Pell Grant student aid.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, prosecutors will ask that she not receive any
prison time, the station said.
</P>
<P>
   Gangelhoff has said she received the $3,000 for tutoring former
player Antoine Broxsie. His lawyer, Phil Resnick, was quoted by
WCCO on Thursday night as saying he had refused to let his client
make a voluntary statement to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something that's behind him, and he would just as soon
leave it behind him and move forward,'' Resnick told the station.
</P>
<P>
   Key witnesses will testify before a federal grand jury in
Minneapolis next week, including Gangelhoff and her sister, Jeanne
Payer, who also was a tutor at the university, and Jackson, WCCO
said. It also said Broxsie and other former players almost
certainly will be subpoenaed.

<HEADLINE> Buses Unloading Trouble for Athletes  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- For some Olympic athletes, getting to
where they're trying to go may seem almost as stressful as their
competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing transportation problems just a day before the Sydney
Games' opening ceremony are similar to those endured in Atlanta
four years ago, U.S. Olympic Committee vice president Sandy Baldwin
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had drivers get lost,'' she said. ''We've had athletes
standing on street corners. This morning, the women's water polo
players missed a scrimmage because their driver took them to the
wrong university.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a Ukranian cyclist was knocked off her bike by a
car as she rode back to the athletes village after training. The
24-year-old cyclist, who was not identified, was treated at a local
hospital for a shoulder injury and released, a police spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The transport problems were the focus of the first daily
coordination meeting between SOCOG and the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   SOCOG spokeswoman Liz Smylie said organizers had brought in 150
extra bus drivers, and will draft in another 100 over the next
couple of days. Tour guides will accompany some of the drivers to
show them the routes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was always going to be a mammoth task,'' she said. ''We
knew it was going to be a challenge. Our contingency plans are
being put into place.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the transport fleet consisted of 3,500 buses and
4,500 drivers, Smylie said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report from SOCOG showed the problems all have been
identified,'' IOC director general Francois Carrard said.
''Extremely serious hard work is being done to remedy the
situation. The situation is improving. We really do hope for the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrard said the transport problems were not a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has happened everywhere,'' he said. ''We always have
these problems shortly before the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Smylie said SOCOG expects 500,000 people to travel to Olympic
Park on peak days during the games.
</P>
<P>
   Around 100 extra soldiers were scheduled to arrive Friday to
assist the hundreds of military personnel who are already involved
in the games, said a spokesman for organizing committee president
Michael Knight.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the extra soldiers would be used as bus drivers
on Olympic routes, the spokesman said, on customary condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   While the transport problems have been around for days,
Baldwin's comments represented the first time officials
acknowledged the athletes were paying the price for a
transportation system that appeared to be a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there had been problems getting U.S. teams to practice
sessions, Baldwin paused before replying, ''Well, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the boxing team had been left without a ride at one
point, and would be practicing primarily at a warehouse the USOC
has rented next door to the Olympic Village.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a godsend,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The water polo team, in the first women's Olympic tournament,
was to have scrimmaged at the University of Sydney but was taken to
another, unidentified school and missed the session.
</P>
<P>
   ''Transportation leaves something to be desired,'' U.S. coach
Guy Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the first week his team was at the village, they were
waiting for a bus for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's not a water polo thing, it's not a U.S. thing. We're
not the only ones, it's happening to everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. Olympic representatives said the men's volleyball
team was dropped off from its bus on the wrong side of a highway
for a practice session. Members wound up crossing the road and
scrambled to find the court.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin said a flood of new arrivals in recent days had put
added pressure on the athletes' transportation system.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got 170 athletes from our team into the village in the last
two days, and now have more than 450 there, and that's when we've
seen the unexpected situations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta finally got its problems solved and Baldwin said she
expected Sydney to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Although the USOC has put its own transit plans for athletes in
place before -- at the 1995 Pan American Games in Argentina --
Baldwin said she did not anticipate having to follow that route in
Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Reno To Push for Puerto Rico Vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
said Thursday the Justice Department will take ''appropriate
steps'' to deal with an effort by residents of Puerto Rico to gain
the right to vote in the upcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ''While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and can vote in any of
the states, the Constitution does not provide for residents of
territories -- Puerto Rico being a territory -- to be able to vote in
presidential elections,'' Reno said during a news conference in
Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A group of residents filed lawsuit in U.S. District Court for
Puerto Rico pushing for the right to vote. The judge hearing the
case in August ordered that Puerto Rico's government ''act with all
possible expediency'' to enable islanders to vote for president as
a constitutional right. The Justice Department filed its appeal
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If Puerto Rican officials go ahead with preparations for the
vote, ''what we would do is look at it, talk with authorities and
take whatever steps would be appropriate to let them know what the
results were based on the court's decision,'' Reno said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Peace Talks Resume  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Clinton administration renewed its efforts
Thursday to end a deadlock between Israel and the Palestinians over
the future of Jerusalem. Hanging in the balance was a long-sought
settlement of their half-century dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most delicate subject,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said at a news conference before she held
separate meetings with a Palestinian negotiating group headed by
Saeb Erekat and then, over dinner, with Israeli Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's senior aide, Dennis Ross, also met with the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will keep working, step by step,'' State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Albright said, was to find a formula that the two
sides can accept -- a task that has eluded President Clinton and all
other American mediators who tried to find a compromise between
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's demand for sovereignty over East
Jerusalem and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's offer of some
local Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah backed the
Palestinians in demanding control of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing to negotiate about and compromise on when it
comes to Jerusalem,'' the crown prince told a group of
Arab-American and Muslim leaders at a New York hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jerusalem is important to the hearts of all Muslims and in
fact it's in the heart of everybody with a sense of humanity,'' he
said. ''This is something on which there can be no compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright called the U.S. diplomatic effort an ''evolving
situation.'' The initiative includes a call at the White House on
Friday by senior Palestinian official Nabil Shaath to talk to Sandy
Berger, Clinton's assistant for national security.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami said it would take 10 days to two weeks ''to show
whether there is grounds for an agreement or it is impossible to
reach an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaath said the Clinton administration was trying at this point
to establish ''a base line'' to measure progress in peacemaking
between Israel and the Palestinians over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hope is to restart the process,'' he told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami described the negotiations with the Palestinians as
''incredibly difficult'' and questioned whether Arafat was ready to
make the final courageous decisions for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Shaath dismissed the Israeli minister's jab with a wave of his
hand, saying, ''This is negotiating hyperbole.''
</P>
<P>
   The new talks were announced Wednesday, the deadline Israel and
the Palestinians had set last year for a final settlement. While
there is no agreement, the Palestinians' Central Council this week
deferred for two months a decision whether to declare statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Thursday that gave her some ''breathing room'' and
that she would use it.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Case Can Be Heard in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A lawsuit accusing the Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.
of assisting in the torture and murder of Nigerian activists can be
heard in federal court in New York rather than England, an appeals
court ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Brown Chomsky, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, called
the ruling from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals a
''significant victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the defendants, Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.,
incorporated in the Netherlands, and Shell Transport and Trading
Co., incorporated in Great Britain, did not return telephone
messages.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies jointly control and operate the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group, an international network of affiliated but
formally independent oil and gas companies, according to the ruling
from Judge Pierre Leval.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs alleged in a lawsuit in federal court in New York
that one of the affiliated companies, Shell Petroleum Development
Co. of Nigeria Limited, coercively took land for oil development
without adequate compensation and polluted air and water in the
Ogoni region of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   They said Shell Nigeria recruited the Nigerian police and
military to attack local villages and suppress the organized

   ''This is a great opportunity,'' said DeLorese Pearson, 27,

freedom, ''I have filled out hundreds of applications, and no one
has called me.''

way. At the moment, I'll settle for anything, just to be part of
society again,'' he said.

   The job fair was organized mainly by federal, state, Cuyahoga
County and Cleveland officials supervising more than 15,000 former
offenders. About 40 employers attended Wednesday's fair, along with
40 social service agencies helping the former offenders.

   ''Some people have gone through the correction system and paid
their debt to society and would make good employees,'' said
Elizabeth Vechter, United Parcel Service employment manager for
northern Ohio.
