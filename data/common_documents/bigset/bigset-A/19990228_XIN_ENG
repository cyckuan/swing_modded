<P>
OTTAWA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Forces opened a
year-2000 command center Friday where troops will respond to the
fallout from any major computer failures caused by the fateful
date change, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters for the military's Operation Abacus will
oversee any deployments on, or around, Jan.1, 2000, based on a
wide range of possible disruptions to the country's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
About 500 troops will begin a training exercise Sunday to make
sure all their communications systems function properly when the
time comes.
</P>
<P>
Some of the scenarios being considered include major air
disasters, loss of power and telephone service in various
communities, and evacuating areas in the event hazardous spills.
</P>
<P>
Defense officials caution that these are just possibilities-- a
clearer picture of what could happen will emerge as
risk-assessment reports start to reach their offices about the
middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
Training exercises for Operation Abacus will continue
throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
A force of 14,500 service personnel has already been earmarked
for mobilization on Jan.1, 2000, and beyond, as part of Operation
Abacus. Another 4,000 reservists are expected to participate.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Becker to Retire Completely By Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- German Tennis star Boris Becker
is set to retire completely by the summer, a magazine quoted him
as saying on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
News magazine Spiegel said the former Wimbledon champion, who
gave up grand slam events in 1997, had realized now was the time
to give up the professional game completely.
</P>
<P>
"I'll stop this summer," the 31-year-old German said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
"I've realized over the past few months that to maintain the
level needed I have to devote myself entirely to tennis. I'll
somehow manage that until the summer but, after that, that's
enough."
</P>
<P>
He said he expected his last event to be the Weissenhof
tournament in Stuttgart in July.
</P>
<P>
Becker, who won Wimbledon three times, the Australian Open
twice and the U.S. Open once, vowed after his withdrawal from
grand slam competition he would continue playing Davis Cup and ATP
Tour events.
</P>
<P>
This year, however, he has played just one singles game and
annoyed organizers of a tournament in London this week by
withdrawing after being diagnosed as having gastro-enteritis.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Historic Presidential Election Concluded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria concluded its historic
presidential election on Saturday with polling stations all over
the country closing at 13:30 (gmt) and counting starting soon
after.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar could not
vote in Saturday's presidential election because he arrived five
minutes after voters' accreditation was concluded in the polling
station near the State House where he was registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar who had earlier gone round the city to monitor the
elections arrived five minutes after 10:00 ( gmt) when voters'
accreditation was concluded and was advised against voting by the
Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Justice
Ephraim Akpata.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar applauded the conduct of the elections, saying "From
what I have seen I believe we are going to have a very peaceful
election."
</P>
<P>
He also commended on the high turnout which was higher than the
previous national Assembly election, saying "I am very happy with
the turnout."
</P>
<P>
He said that Nigerians and politicians have worked hard to
ensure the success of the transition program, which will terminate
on May 29 with the handover to a civilian administration.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar disclosed that the constitution for the next republic
will be promulgated next week. "we have almost finished work on
the constitution and I hope that during the week we will put
finishing touches to the document and release it," he added.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election is the fourth and last vote under the
current on-going transition program in the run-up to the hand-over
of power to a democratically-elected president.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 million registered voters in Nigeria cast their ballots
in a contest between former head of state General Olusegun
Obasanjo, presidential candidate of the People's Democratic Party
(PDP), and former Finance Minister Olu Falae, joint flag bearer of
the Alliance of the All People's Party (APP) and the Alliance for
Democracy (AD).
</P>
<P>
Abubakar Nuhu, a veterinary doctor, said in capital Abuja: "we
are voting for Obasanjo in the hope that if he wins, he would
accept that criticism and disagreements are part of democratic
ethos and that opponents should not be hounded or treated as
felons."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that an Obasanjo presidency will clear
the mess of long years of military rule that has left the
country's economy prostrate and its infrastructure in ruins.
</P>
<P>
A civil servant called Anselm Onuka said in the capital that
the exercise has provided an opportunity for Nigerians to vote for
a presidential candidate of their choice for the first time in six
years.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that whoever emerges would face the challenges of the
economy like the fuel problem and inflation that have left many
Nigerians economically stranded," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his campaign, PDP candidate Obasanjo has called for
political reform to help revive Nigeria's moribund economy and
pledged to set up an anti-corruption agency with wide-ranging
powers used to deal with corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
Joint APP-AD candidate Falae has also promised to get the
Nigerian economy back on track, saying "I can have a debt strategy
in place, and get foreign investment flowing again by creating an
environment that is investment friendly."
</P>
<P>
Saturday'"s election was being closely monitored by
international observers from the European Union, The Organization
of African Unity, the Commonwealth and the U.S. Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who arrived here Thursday,
said Saturday that the turnout has been very impressive and
orderly."

<HEADLINE> GCC Backs UAE Over Island Dispute with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) Saturday extended its support to the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) in its fresh dispute with Iran over the Gulf
island of Abu Mousa where Tehran recently opened a municipal
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian move was an attempt to "consolidate the Iranian
occupation of the island," GCC Secretary General Jamil
Al-Hujailan was quoted as saying by Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hujailan reiterated GCC support to the UAE's right to
recover the three Islands of Greater and Lesser Tunbs and
Abu Mousa in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"Iran would contribute to boost ties with other Gulf states by
accepting repeated UAE calls to solve the dispute through the
international court of justice," said Al-Hujailan.
</P>
<P>
The GCC chief said the Gulf Arab states were striving for
building strong ties with Iran, but "any consolidation of the
occupation would be harmful to these ties."
</P>
<P>
The UAE last Saturday lodged protests against Iran over its
move in Abu Mousa and said Tehran was attempting to change the
demographic nature of the island.
</P>
<P>
The move is illegal and does not grant Iran any sovereignty
rights on the island, the UAE said in a memo sent to the Iranian
government, the United Nations, the Arab League and the GCC.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance
established in 1981, groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The three islands have been at the center of a long-standing
dispute between Abu Dhabi and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iran has rejected calls by the UAE and the GCC to accept
international arbitration on the fate of these islands, which are
strategically located near the strait of Kormuz through which some
two-thirds of the world's oil is shipped to the world markets.

Sufian Ahmed said Saturday that more than 4,099 million Birr (7.6

economic growth is expected this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Lagos State Administrator
Colonel Mohammed Marwa said here Saturday that the peaceful
conclusion of the presidential election has clearly justified
commitment of the present military government to the power to
civilian transition.
</P>
<P>
Marwa was speaking to reporters after he monitored the fourth
and last vote in eight local government areas in the state under
the on-going transition program put forward eight months ago by
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The successful conclusion of all the elections including the
local, state and National Assembly elections under the transition
program has justified the promise made by General Abubakar that he
would not stay beyond the handing-over date of May 29, the state
administrator noted.
</P>
<P>
Marwa said: "The Head of State, General Abubakar, deserves an
applause for keeping to his promise."  The present arrangement
would give the incoming administration enough time to evolve good
policies that would launch the country into the next millennium,
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the turnout at the presidential election in
Lagos State was larger than the election for the Senate and House
of Representatives held on February 20, which was blamed on poor
campaign and enlightenment on the part of politicians.

<HEADLINE> China Continues Anti-Graft Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The latest issue of Seeking
Truth Magazine, which will be published throughout China tomorrow,
carries the full report of Wei Jianxing, secretary of the
Communist Party of China's Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection, on stepping up the anti-corruption drive this year.
</P>
<P>
In the report, delivered at the Third Plenary Session of the
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection held in Beijing on
January 13, Wei said that of the 158,000 Party members who were
penalized by the end of December 1998, 5,357 were officials at the
county magistrate level, 410 were above the prefecture
commissioner level, and 12 were above the provincial governor
level.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorial organs across China have placed 35,000 cases on
file, of which 10,000 are key cases. Officials involved in these
cases included 1,820 officials at or above the country magistrate
level. People's Courts have tried 33,000 economic cases, 19,500 of
which were cases of corruption, bribery and dereliction of duty,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The state has attained the objective of banning the People's
Liberation Army, the armed police, legal organs, and Party and
government departments from participating in business activities,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Outlining five major tasks for this year, Wei, a Standing
Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of
China Central Committee, said leading government officials should
maintain their honesty and set high demands for themselves. They
may not hold meetings at 12 scenic areas specifically prohibited
by the Central Government, and they must control the number of
construction projects of new office buildings and keep a tight
management on going abroad at government expenses.
</P>
<P>
The state will continue to crack down on violations of the law
by leading officials of Party and government departments, and
priority will be given to the most significant cases.
</P>
<P>
Unhealthy tendencies in government departments and all trades
will be corrected, and burdens on farmers should be lightened, Wei
said.
</P>
<P>
A system of auditing whereby leading officials will assume
economic responsibilities will also be established. The state will
continue to implement the system of publishing village and factory
financial accounts and improve democratic management, he said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these goals, the Party will launch a campaign on
study, politics and moral integrity, enhance supervision of
leading Party and government officials, and carry out reforms at
procuratorial organs this year, Wei said.

ZHUHAI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Le Kha Phieu, general secretary
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, showed
great interest in shareholding during his visit to an enterprise
in the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone in south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
The top leader of Vietnam today had an extended stay at the
Gree Electric Appliance Holding Co., which has grown from a small
factory to a well-known enterprise producing 2.5 million air
conditioners annually.
</P>
<P>
Phieu inquired about the details of the enterprise's
transformation into a shareholding firm, and said Vietnam is
conducting large-scale restructuring of enterprises, including a
pilot shareholding company.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that this is currently limited to
within enterprises and does not yet involve a securities market,
adding that China is bolder than Vietnam in this area.
</P>
<P>
Before he left, Phieu said he hopes the two sides can continue
discussions and exchanges on China's reform and opening-up
experience.

<HEADLINE> Katyusha Rockets Fired into Northern Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Katyusha rockets
presumably fired by Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas from south
Lebanon slammed into a northern Israeli village Sunday, causing
slight damage to a house, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
One woman was treated for shock after one rocket hit her
house, the radio quoted Israel's army spokesman as saying. The
other landed unexploded at the entrance road to the village.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not
disclose the village's name, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, sporadically fires
Katyusha rockets into northern Israeli villages and towns, mostly
in retaliation for Israel's attacks on Lebanese civilians in its
self-styled security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The zone was set up by Israel in 1985 with the claimed aim of
protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has since been spearheading a guerrilla war against
Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports reaching here said that four Israeli
soldiers, including a general, were killed and several others
wounded in two Hezbollah roadside bomb blasts Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The general was the commander of the liaison unit in the
Israeli army, the reports quoted pro-Israeli SLA sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman has not commented on the reports.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, an Israeli commando unit was ambushed by
Hezbollah in south Lebanon, with three officers killed and five
others wounded.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Doctors Conduct Heart, Liver Transplants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese doctors Sunday
conducted the country's first heart and liver transplants since a
law on organ transplant went into effect in October 1997, the
Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
The two vital organs, together with kidneys and corneas yet to
find recipients, were removed from a single brain-dead donor at
the Kochi Red Cross Hospital in Kochi Prefecture, western Japan,
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
At Osaka University Hospital, also in western Japan, a male
company employee with a history of hypertrophied cardiomyopathy
for 40 years began receiving a heart transplant at 7:30 p.m. local
time after the organ arrived.
</P>
<P>
Doctors started operating on the recipient after they were
informed by Kochi hospital that the donor's heart was in good
condition.
</P>
<P>
The transplanted heart has begun beating, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
Later Sunday, doctors began transplanting the donated liver to
a 43-year-old male resident of the city of Nagano, at Shinshu
University Hospital in Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture, central Japan.
The liver was the first from a brain-dead donor in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The heart transplant is Japan's second, following the one in
1968 that led to a murder complaint against surgeon Juro Wada at
Sapporo Medical College, who performed the transplant, although
prosecutors did not press charges.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Japan had not performed a transplant from a brain-
dead donor since the Wada case. The incident had made organ
transplants from brain-dead donors taboo in Japan until the Diet,
or parliament, passed the 1997 law.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Inland Areas, Macao to Strengthen Trade Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China's inland areas will
continue to intensify trade cooperation with Macao, actively
support trade activities beneficial to economic development and
social stability in Macao, and ensure the smooth return of Macao
to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hui, director of the Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
Macao of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (
MOFTEC), made the remarks during an interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the inland area and Macao reached 870 million U.S.
dollars last year, up 13.8 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Macao business people invested 438 million U.S. dollars in the
inland area in 1998, up 11 percent on a yearly basis. The inland
area signed contracts involving a combined 266 million U.S.
dollars in contractual projects, labor services and design and
consultation in Macao last year.
</P>
<P>
The inland area has become Macao's largest import source and
transit trade destination, and its fourth largest export market,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Macao also ranks 10th among sources of overseas funds actually
utilized in the inland area, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that this trading partnership is complementary, and
the inland area will implement more flexible policies to encourage
Macao's investment and trade.
</P>
<P>
Wang is very optimistic about the future of trade cooperation
between the Chinese inland area and Macao, saying that the return
of Macao to the motherland will provide new opportunities for and
inject new vitality into Macao's economic expansion.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Continuing Attacks on Iraqi Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes on Sunday
attacked Iraqi military installations with bombs and missiles in
the northern on-fly zone, a U.S. military official said.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at about 1:55 p.m. to 2:20 p.m. local
time (0855 to 0920 GMT) when the U.S. Air Force F-15 patrolling
the no-fly zone were fired upon by Iraq's anti-aircraft sites,
said Capt. Mike Blass, a spokesman for the U.S. European Command
which overseas the northern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The F-15s fired three air-to-ground missiles and dropped eight
bombs -- three laser-guided bombs, two GBU-12 precision-guided
bombs and three BGU-24 precision-guided bombs -- on targets mostly
around the city of Mosul, Blass said.
</P>
<P>
The targets attacked by the U.S. planes included an Iraqi air
defense headquarters, a radio relay site and a surface-to-air
missile site, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 clashes have taken place since last December's
bombing raids against Iraqi targets by U.S. and British warplanes
as Iraq has announced even since that it would challenged all
western warplanes violating its airspace over both northern and
southern no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
But the United States remained adamant to pursuing its
containment of Iraq by patrolling the two no-fly zones imposed by
Washington and London since the Gulf War in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Election Commission Fails to Decide on Election Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Election Commission of
Nepal on Sunday failed again to make a decision on whether to hold
the election to the House of Representatives phase-wise or in a
single day on May 3.
</P>
<P>
The commission called Sunday a second all-party meeting to
discuss the schedule of the election. Officials at the commission
were hopeful that a final decision could be made after it.
</P>
<P>
However, Chief Election Commissioner Bishnu Pratap Shah said
the Election Commission will be compelled to hold the polls in at
least two phases because of security reason.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-leftist guerrillas have launched a violent people's
war in the country since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Talking to Radio Nepal, Shah said that 71,000 security
personnel will be needed to make the election free and fair and
provide security to the people, but the police said it could
provide only 28,000 personnel for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some political parties suggested the mobilization
of army for the polls but the government said the army can be
involved indirectly and the number is still not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
He opposed the idea of recruiting temporary police, saying
there could be political influence in their recruitment.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is up to the Election Commission but not
the political parties to decide the schedule of the polls.
</P>
<P>
As recommended by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, King
Birendra dissolved the House of Representatives on January 15 and
set fresh polls for May 3.
</P>
<P>
But the Nepali Congress led by Koirala favored phase-wise polls
while the other parties including its ruling partners the
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and
the Nepal Sadbhavana Party demanded polls at one go on May 3 as
announced by the King.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) even
threatened to boycott the election if the government would try to
go ahead forcibly with phase-wise polls.
</P>
<P>
Under the kingdom's constitution, the King determines date for
the election on the recommendation of the cabinet. The House of
Representatives Election Act 1991, however, empowers the Election
Commission to announce the date and time.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Koirala had said that it is up to the Election
Commission to decide; the government had reached an agreement with
the constitutional body in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission said about 13.5 million adults are
eligible to vote in the polls and more than 8,000 polling stations
will be set up throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> 4 Israeli Soldiers, Officers Killed in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Four Israeli military
personnel, including a general, were killed and three others
wounded in south Lebanon on Sunday in two guerrilla bomb blasts,
Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the general, who was not named, was
commander of the liaison unit in the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying its fighters detonated two
roadside bombs when Israeli convoys passed by.
</P>
<P>
The first bomb exploded at 11:50 (0850 GMT) on a road between
the villages of Kawkaba and Hasbaya in the eastern sector of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The second one was detonated 10 minutes later only one
kilometer away from the first blast site, the party's statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The blasts took place when the two targeted Israeli convoys
were carrying Israeli senior military officials to their south
Lebanon commander headquarters at Marjayoun, about five kilometers
from the explosion sites.
</P>
<P>
The attacks raised to seven the number of Israeli soliders kill
in south Lebanon since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, three Israeli officers were killed and five others
wounded in an ambush staged by Hezbollah guerrillas on an Israeli
paratroops commando in western Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, conflicts between Israeli forces and Lebanese
guerrillas who are fighting to oust Israelis out of the country
have never stopped.

ISLAMABAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will encourage the

said Pakistani Minister for Kashmir Affairs Abdul Majid Malik
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a visiting Taliban delegation led by Al-Haj Abdul
Raqib, Taliban senior official responsible for repatriation and

Pakistan has asked the Taliban government to make the
atmosphere conducive for the returning of nearly 1.2 million
Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
</P>

Raqib said since the Taliban militia have held over 90 percent
of Afghan territory where strict Islamic laws have been
established, a compatible, expedient and phased withdrawal of
Afghan refugees from neighboring countries are now possible.

HOHHOT, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River embankments in
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China have sustained
a high-level ice inflow for the past 84 days, and so far no danger
from breaches has been reported.
</P>
<P>
This year's icing-up period of the country's second longest
river has coupled with high water levels to create great
difficulties for local residents in combating the icy floods. A
total of 52,000 people from all over the region have been drafted
into emergency teams, and supplies of materials and equipment have
been made ready for any rescue work in case a dangerous situation
develops.
</P>
<P>
The local government has warned of potential dangers of
breaches along the 919-km-long embankments, which was built in the
50s and 60s. The flood-control capacity of the levees has
diminished and many sections need repairing, according to a local
source.
</P>
<P>
Reservoirs on the upper reaches of the river have been used to
hold the water, and so far, more than 700 km of levee sections
have been reinforced, and danger spots at seven places are being

<HEADLINE> Beijing Moves to Lure More Multinationals (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing has great appeal for many of these corporations because
of its various advantages in location, professionals, information,
technology, and services, said Vice Mayor Zhang Mao.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that nearly 300 of the world's top 500
multinationals have invested in China, and over half of them are
in Beijing. More than 80 multinationals have already moved their
regional headquarters in Asia to the Chinese capital, including
world-renowned companies such as Motorola and Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
In foreigners' eyes, the capital city of Beijing stands for a "
responsible China," which has stood the test of the Asian
financial crisis and has kept its currency stable, said municipal
trade official Wu Yutian.
</P>
<P>
China has also proved to have strong appeal to foreign
investors from all Asian nations, according to a survey conducted
among 5,000 Asian enterprises recently, with more than 70 percent
of the firms saying they plan to stay in China for more than ten
years.
</P>
<P>
Motorola, which has invested most heavily in China among
American enterprises, moved its North Asian headquarters to
Beijing last year and pledged to increase its investment in China
to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars next year from the present one billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Along with Beijing, other Chinese cities such as Shanghai,
Tianjin and Guangzhou are also mapping out similar preferential
policies to attract more multinational corporations.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Moves to Lure More Multinationals (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital of Beijing
is expected to unveil a new set of regulations shortly which aim
to attract more multinational regional headquarters to the city.
</P>
<P>
Along with the exemption from the local income tax of three
percent, such regional headquarters can expect to enjoy
preferential treatment in exporting products, importing equipment,
transferring foreign currencies and setting up their own finance
companies.
</P>
<P>
Economists are hailing this move as a major step introduced by
the city to boost this year's flat overseas investment influx in
the face of the Asian financial crisis. These steps are also in
accordance with the recent government pledge to increase support
for multinationals investing in China.
</P>
<P>
Attracted by the nation's huge market potential, overseas
investment comprises a major driving force behind China's high
economic growth. China presently ranks second in the world in the
amount of used overseas investment, claiming 324,000 overseas-
funded enterprises with investment totaling 267.4 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists have warned that China must work
harder this year to keep the momentum of overseas investment
influx since the global investment capacity is shrinking as a
result of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Multinationals have therefore become the primary target of all
countries soliciting overseas investment, since they have become
the powerhouses of world economic growth.

Ning, 23.

</P>
<P>
In an all-attack fight Zhang controlled the games by her serves
and played more steadily than her compatriot.

"I made too many unforced errors and lost the match, " said 21-
year-old left hander Dai Yun, who captured her first Grand Prix
title at the Chinese Taipei Open early this month.

In an all-Indonesian clash, Denny Kantono and Budi Antonius

BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua)-- Wei Jianxing, a member of the
Political Bureau Standing Committee of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), met with the 10th delegation
of the "Great Wall Program" from Japan here today.
</P>
<P>
Ichiro Ozawa, leader of Japan's Liberal Party, is serving as
the senior adviser to the delegation, which is headed by Syozo
Azuma, a member of the Japanese Diet.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that Sino-Japanese relations are facing with both
development opportunities and challenges at the turn of the
century, and it is the common task of China and Japan to decrease
or even eliminate the various negative factors in the process of
developing bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the Japanese statesmen and people in various
sectors will serve better Sino-Japanese relations in their words
and deeds, Wei told Ozawa.
</P>
<P>
Only in the spirit of drawing lessons from history while
looking to the future, and properly handling historical
understanding and the issue of Taiwan, can Sino-Japanese relations
realize a new phase of steady development, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Wei spoke highly of the "Great Wall Program," which has had a
positive impact on the growth of Sino-Japanese friendly ties. He
expressed the hope that the program will make new contributions to
the establishment of a friendly and cooperative Sino-Japanese
partnership devoted to peace and development, a position which was
confirmed by China and Japan during Chinese President Jiang Zemin'
s state visit to Japan last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Over 40 world leaders are
expected to attend the inauguration ceremony of Nigeria's elected
president on May 29 this year, Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has said.
</P>
<P>
While monitoring the conduct of Saturday presidential election
in capital Abuja, Abubakar said that all heads of the member
states of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
are expected and many other world leaders have already indicated
their interest to attend.
</P>
<P>
The head of state expressed optimism that the handing-over
ceremony will be successful as the Nigerian government has made
enough efforts to ensure its success, according to a New Nigerian
report Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said that the period between now and the handing-over
date has been set aside for any by-election.
</P>
<P>
The in-coming president will be allowed to under-study the
activities of the current government during the period, according
to the head of state.  General Abubakar said that he will retire
from military service after handing over power to a democratically
elected president on May 29.
</P>
<P>
He declined to say what he would do after retirement, but said
"I will not go into politics."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the present regime has started disembarking
the military from civil post to the barracks and assured that
before May 29, all military officers will go back to the barracks.

<P>
Wei went on to say that the establishment of a healthy and
stable Sino-Japanese relationship strictly guided by the Sino-
Japanese Joint Statement and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and
Friendship, will not only benefit the fundamental interests of the
two peoples, but also serve as an important guarantee to peace and
development in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
China has always carried out an independent foreign policy of
peace and it opposes the practice of seeking one's interests on
the basis of infringing upon the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of other countries, Wei said. Japan, a power in the Asia-
Pacific region, should seriously regard the lessons of history and
adhere to the path of peaceful development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa said he will carry forward the tradition of cherishing
Japan-China ties bequeathed Kakuei Tanaka, the former Japanese
prime minister. He told Wei that he will continue to work for the
enhancement of mutual understanding and trust between the two
countries and dedicate himself to the healthy and stable
development of Japan-China ties in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The "Great Wall Program" was jointly initiated by the All-China
Youth Federation and the Japan-China Association for Youth
Exchange in 1989.

On another occasion today, vice chairman Buhe of the National
People's Congress Standing Committee, also met with and hosted a

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Winds up his Tokyo Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen returned here Sunday afternoon, ending his six-day Tokyo
trip during which he attended an international meeting of donor
countries and aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen was accompanied by Foreign Minister Hor Namhong,
Finance Minister Keat Chhon, Minister of Council of Ministers Sok
An and other government officials.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told the reporters at the airport that his official
visit to Tokyo and the third Consultative Group (CG) meeting on
aid for Cambodia were successful.
</P>
<P>
"It is a victory of the royal government of Cambodia and
Cambodian people who support the new government and I hope we will
have a positive change in the society since the aid we received is
more than that we expected," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "I will resign if there is no reform, which I had
promised during the CG meeting, within two years."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hun Sen pledged to crack down and stop the illegal
logging within three months.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed that he will sack all the corrupt people in the
government.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Hun Sen met with his Japanese counterpart
Keizo Obuchi and Foreign Minister Nasahiko Komura. They exchanged
views on strengthening and developing the economic and trade
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Japan pledged to provide 100 million U.S. dollars in aid to
Cambodia and agreed to resume yen-denominated loans for the first
time in about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
At the CG meeting, major donor nations pledged 470 million U.S.
dollars in aid this year to Cambodia which exceeded Cambodia's 450
million dollars request.
</P>
<P>
In return, Hun Sen promised to undertake such reforms as
downsizing the armed forces, cracking down on illegal logging and
corruption. He also agreed to allow donor nations to check on the
progress of reforms every three months.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen donor countries (including the United States, Britain,
France, China, Japan), seven international finance organizations
and three NGOs participated the two-day meeting hosted by the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The next donor conference for Cambodia will be in Paris next
February. First and Second CG meetings were held in Tokyo and
Paris.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Undecided on Fate of Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- After being detained for over
eight months in the United States, Kampala City Mayor Nasser
Sebaggala was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment Wednesday on
charges of bank fraud, transporting forged checks and lying to
customs officers.
</P>
<P>
This verdict triggered a new spate of hot debate among city
councilors on whether the capital city should have a new mayor.
Yet they have still not yet decided on the mayorship of Sebaggala.
</P>
<P>
A Boston court sentenced Sebaggala to15 months in jail, ordered
him to pay a fine of 10,000 U.S. Dollars and to refund 44,000
Dollars he fraudulently withdrew from Bank Boston. The sentence
ran from December 4, 1998 when he was convicted.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the sentence, Sebaggala's political assistant
Matthias Nsubuga said that the embattled mayor has no intention to
resign. His former campaign managers and supporters have also
maintained that he is still the mayor of Kampala city.
</P>
<P>
The mayor's lawyer Paul Kelly also said there was a chance for
his return to Kampala within nine months because the mayor has
already appealed against the guilty verdict.
</P>
<P>
Kampala City Council's Public Relations Office Simon Muhumuza
said that although the country's Constitution says that the mayor
can be removed if sentenced to a certain prison term, yet it does
not specify whether the mayor can be removed if sentenced abroad.
</P>
<P>
Solicitor General Peter Kabatsi said last December that the
post of mayor would automatically fall vacant if Sebaggala was
sentenced to jail for nine months or more.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Local Government Kahinda Otafiire said
Thursday that the capital city needs a new mayor, but an official
with the Electoral Commission said that it has not yet been
informed whether the post of the Kampala district chairman has
fallen vacant.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision paper reported Sunday that the 51-year-old mayor
is still earning salary and allowances from the Kampala City
Council.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Bart Katureebe said he is yet to study the
contents of the law over the fate of Sebaggala and promised to
advise the Electoral Commission when time comes.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala, who was sworn in as Kampala's 16th mayor in May of
1998, is the city's first directly elected mayor. He is said to
enjoy wide support from the local people.
</P>
<P>
He is short of an A level certificate required for his post, a
target often attacked by his learned opponents. Yet this is a kind
of advantage which made him so popular among the largely
illiterate common people.
</P>
<P>
In April 1998, about one third of Kampala's eligible voters
cast ballots for a new mayor. Most of them are the local people
because the intellectuals were tired of voting, Radio Broadcasting
Commissioner Jack Turyamwijuka told Xinhua over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
During his months of detention, his supporters in Kampala
launched several fund-raising campaigns to prepare for his return
home. They even wrote to U.S. judges, demanding them to be lenient
on the mayor's sentence.
</P>
<P>
Yet all these efforts could not help much. The mayor was
sentenced and ordered to serve his term in a prison in the state
of Pennsylvania, dashing all hope of the mayor's quick return
home.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government believed that Sebaggala committed all
the crimes in his personal capacity and therefore could do nothing
about it, leaving the newly-elected mayor to fend for himself on
foreign soil.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldiers Killed In South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 28 (Xinhua) -- At least four Israeli soldiers
were killed in south Lebanon on Sunday in two bomb blasts,
Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying its fighters detonated two
roadside bombs when Israeli convoys passed by.
</P>
<P>
One bomb exploded on a road between the villages between
Kawkaba and Hasbaya in the eastern sector of the Israeli occupied
border zone in south Lebanon, the party's statement said.
</P>
<P>
The second one was detonated only one kilometer away from the
first blast site, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The attack raised to seven the number of Israeli soldier killed
in south Lebanon since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, three Israeli officers were killed in an ambush
staged by Hezbollah guerrillas on an Israeli paratroops commando
in western Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, conflicts between Israeli forces and guerrillas
who fight to oust Israelis out of the country have never stopped.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reiterates Refusal to Deal With U.N. Panels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Mohammed
Amir Rasheed reiterated Sunday that Iraq will not deal with U.N.
panels established recently to assess what Iraq has accomplished
in implementing the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a news conference, Rasheed said that Iraq recently
sent "briefings" to some members of the U.N. Security Council
regarding what Iraq has implemented in all the different areas of
prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq did so because it deems it "useful" to inform some
members of the Security Council of the facts, in order that they
are not ignorant of some of the basic elements of Iraqi fulfillment
of its obligations.
</P>
<P>
He said the documents were prepared before the mid-December
U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq when a comprehensive review
of Iraq's progress in disarmament was under discussion.
</P>
<P>
Celso Amorim, Brazilian ambassador to the U.N. and chairman of
the U.N. panel assessing the state of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, said Friday that Iraq had submitted a hefty document
and invited him to visit Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed said Iraq invited Amorim to visit Iraq in his capacity
as Brazilian ambassador to the U.N., not as head of any of the
three panels established according to an agreement reached by the
Security Council last month.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspection in Iraq has come to a standstill since
the December U.S.-British military air strikes to punish what was
claimed as Iraqi failure to cooperate fully with U.N. arms
inspectors in charge of eliminating Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament panel is one of the three panels assessing
U.N. future policy toward Iraq. The other two panels are on
humanitarian situation in Iraq and prisoners of war and Kuwaiti
property and archives.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq has declared that it will not deal with these
panels since Iraq was not consulted on their establishment.
Instead, Iraq demands an immediately lifting of the U.N. sanctions
imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Rasheed said that Iraq has fulfilled
the export of 165 million barrels of crude oil so far under the
fifth phase of the oil-for-food program which started last
November 26.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Iraq so far had received only 11 million
U.S. dollars worth of spare parts direly needed in the oil sector
to order to boost crude export, now below the 3-billion level in
six months.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been allowed to export 5.2 billion dollars worth of
oil to buy food and medicine for its 22 million people. In
addition to that, Iraq was also allowed to import 300 million
dollars worth of spare parts to repair its dilapidated oil
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The oil minister called on Saudi Arabia to reduce production of
crude oil to contribute to a recovery of oil prices. He complained
that Iraq will lose 6 billion dollars from mid-1998 to mid-1999
due to the sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the U.S. and British representatives in the
U.N. Sanctions Committee for blocking the approval of some 140
out of a total of 507 contracts it signed with foreign companies
to purchase oil spare parts.
</P>
<P>
He added that the sharp decline of the oil prices in the world
markets and lack of spare parts will be reflected negatively on
the current phase of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Iraq now has a capacity of exporting 2.1 million barrels of oil
per day, said Rasheed, adding that after the delivery of
contracted spare parts, Iraq will be able to export 2.5 million
barrels per day.

On February 17, Israeli troops and the pro-Israel South Lebanon
Army entered Arnoun, which lies just outside the Israeli occupied
zone, laid down barbed wire and land mines around the village and
set up a checkpoint to supervise traffic in and out of the village.
</P>
<P>
Israel justified the seizure as a "technical adjustment," not
an expansion of the occupied zone which it set up in 1985 with the
claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that Arnoun, with no more than 70 residents, was
always used by Lebanon's Hezbollah, or Party of God, guerrillas as
an operation pad.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, thousands of Lebanese students flocked to the Arnoun
village to protest the Israeli aggression. They tore down the
barbed wires set up by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomatic sources said Israel has no intention to
replace the barbed wire barricades around Arnoun.

<HEADLINE> Granny Zhang Lives in Harmony with Tibetan Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- In a compound on Barger Street
in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Granny Zhang
Zangyue and her family from North China's Hebei Province have been
living in harmony with Tibetan neighbors for more than four
decades.
</P>
<P>
During every Tibetan Spring Festival, Zhang takes her family
members to call on their Tibetan neighbors and to extend festival
greetings to them.
</P>
<P>
"I have become accustomed to my life here in Lhasa and I can
not tear myself away from the compound where there are 23
households."
</P>
<P>
Granny Zhang is just one of the 1,293 residents of Han, Hui and
Tibetan ethnic groups under the Barger Street Neighborhood
Committee with 96 percent residents being Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, 62, came to Lhasa with her husband in 1959. Zhang
brought up her two sons and one daughter in the compound. Now her
son-in-law and daughters-in-law are all Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
With a heavy Hebei accent, Granny Zhang said, "Every year we
spend two spring festivals -- Chinese Spring Festival and Tibetan
Lunar Spring Festival."
</P>
<P>
She said, "Most of the households in the compound are Tibetans.
Although residents here belong to different ethnic groups, they
always respect each other. When a family is in difficulty, it
will receive aid from all other residents."
</P>
<P>
A senior lama, Nmg Zhoin, lived in his apartment upstairs and
his neighbors often help him to carry heavy things to his room.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago Zhang's husband passed away. Barger Street
Neighborhood Committee and her Tibetan neighbors also offered her
a lot of help.
</P>
<P>
Now every morning, Granny Zhang goes with her Tibetan neighbors
to walk around Johkang Monastery, one of the oldest temples in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Granny Zhang likes to chat with her Tibetan neighbors. One of
her favorite subject is the great change that has taken place in
Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
She said that forty years ago, it took her almost one month to
travel from Hebei to Lhasa, but now the time for the traveling is
only about two or three days.
</P>
<P>
"Lhasa City is becoming increasingly beautiful. When we walk
along the stone-plate road outside our compound, we feel
comfortable," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON February 28 (Xinhua) -- The third world countries are "
absolutely united" to oppose genetically modified foods, the
Independent newspaper Sunday quoted a senior Ethiopian official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Tewolde Gebre Egziabher was speaking after last week's talks
collapsed in Cartagena, Colombia, following the United States'
accusation that the developing countries were endangering free
trade.
</P>
<P>
The paper said biotechnology firms had consistently argued that
GM crops' increased resistance to parasites and disease makes them
valuable to the third world.
</P>
<P>
An international treaty to regulate trade in GM produce had
been discussed by 132 nations. Egziabher, the senior third world
negotiator at the talks, said third world resistance to the
imposition of GM crops was growing.
</P>
<P>
The third world countries are united in opposing U.S. plans to
"decide what we eat," he told the newspaper in an exclusive
interview.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that last week the government of RioGrande do
Sul, in Brazil, would ban the planting of GM beans produced by the
U.S. giant Monsanto. And India's Supreme Court stopped trials of
GM cotton.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Denies Firing Katyusha Rockets at Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon on Sunday denied that
the Katyusha rockets landed on northern Israel overnight were
fired from its territory.
</P>
<P>
Security sources, who asked not to be named, said that Lebanon
had not got any information from Lebanese guerrillas that they
fired Katyusha rockets into Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli radio reported Sunday morning that several rockets
fell on upper Galelii area in northern Israel and one of them hit
a civilian house. Other rockets landed on nearby crop fields.
</P>
<P>
The attack didn't cause human casualties, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
The sources termed the reports as false and were fabricated by
Israel to cover the confusion among Israelis following the
liberation of the Arnoun village by Lebanese students.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Lebanese university students Friday removed all
fences around Arnoun erected by Israeli forces who attempted to
annex the village into its occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On February 17, Israeli troops and the pro-Israel South Lebanon
Army entered Arnoun, which lies just outside the Israeli occupied
zone, laid down barbed wire and land mines around the village and
set up a checkpoint to supervise traffic in and out of the village.

</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been fighting against its
occupation.

<HEADLINE> Riyadh Slams Israeli Annexation of Lebanese Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Sunday
condemned Israel's annexation of the Arnoun village in south
Lebanon, saying that the move was against international laws.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Press Agency monitored here quoted an official as
saying that "this move is a continuation of Israel's expansionist
policy that rejects peace."
</P>
<P>
The official called on the international community to force
Israel to implement the United Nations Security Council Resolution
425 adopted in 1978 that calls for a complete and unconditional
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On February 17, Israeli troops and the pro-Israel South Lebanon
Army entered Arnoun, which lies just outside the Israeli occupied
zone, laid down barbed wire and land mines around the village and
set up a checkpoint to supervise traffic in and out of the village.
</P>

Israel claimed that Arnoun, with no more than 70 residents, was

</P>
<P>
Lebanon had lodged a complaint against the fresh Israeli
aggression to the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
the multi-national monitoring group entrusted with overseeing
truce between Lebanese guerrillas and Israeli troops and
precluding civilians from conflicts.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, thousands of Lebanese students flocked to the Arnoun
village to protest the Israeli aggression. They tore down the
barbed wires set up by Israel.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Selling Weapons to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian official
has again denied reports that Russia had sold weapons to Iraq in
violation of a U.N. arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said these
reports were "groundless" in an interview with Kuwait's Arabic
daily Al-Watan published here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The British Sunday Telegraph newspaper recently carried reports
claiming that Russia had signed an agreement worth 100 million
pounds sterling (162 million U.S. dollars) with Iraq to strengthen
its air defense capability.
</P>
<P>
To counter the claim, head of Russia's Ross Vioginia company
specialized in exporting weapons to foreign countries affirmed
that his country was sticking to international resolutions banning
sales of weapons to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Russian foreign ministry officials had earlier slammed the
reports as "provocation" which smacked of cold war disinformation
approaches and insisted that Moscow "fully and meticulously"
observed United Nations sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But the British newspaper stood by its story, claiming that "a
very different picture of Moscow's military ties with Iraq has
emerged from Russia's military experts."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has been enforcing a comprehensive
embargo against Baghdad since Iraq's invasion and occupation of
Kuwait in 1990, which triggered the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> China Slashes Telecommunication Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China announced here today
that it will cut the charges on using the Internet by about 50
percent and lower international telephone fees as of March 1.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Information Industry (MII) said in a news
release today that it will also lower charges on fixed telephone
installation and on opening mobile telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
It also announced to stop levying administrative fees on local
telephone call networks and cut administrative fees levied on long-
distance telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
Postal fees of letters will be raised by 20-60 percent, MII
said in the news release.
</P>
<P>
"The adjustment of postal and telecommunication fees will
greatly lower the general level of charges," the news releases
said.
</P>
<P>
"This move is aimed to resolve the protruding contradictions in
the structure of fees," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to MII, charges on international telephone calls to
the United States will drop from 18.4 yuan to 15 yuan per minute,
an reduction of 18 percent. Fees on international telephones calls
to Asian countries will be cut to 12 yuan per minute.
</P>
<P>
Individuals using the Internet will pay four yuan per hour for
the first 60 hours in a month and pay eight yuan for every
additional hour in the month.
</P>
<P>
Internet service providers (ISP) will pay the same fees as
individual users do for using dedicated lines linking with
Internet.
</P>
<P>
China has adjusted telecommunications fees for several times in
the past decade. The latest adjustment took place in December 1996
when international telephone fees were reduced.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Central Government's Tibet Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The following is a description
of the Central Government of the People's Republic of China's
Tibet policy:
</P>
<P>
Tibet has regional autonomy in accordance with the Constitution
of the People's Republic of China. In September 1965, the First
Session of the First People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous
Region was held in Lhasa and the Tibet Autonomous Region was
officially established.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Regional Autonomy Law, the People's
Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region has formulated more than
60 rules, regulations, decrees, decisions, and resolutions since
1965 on politics, economy, culture, and education that suit the
reality of Tibet and the interests of the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
China's Central Government has introduced a series of
preferential economic policies for Tibet. Since 1980, agricultural
and pastoral parts of Tibet have had diverse economic reforms that
focus on household production and farmers and herdsmen are exempt
from certain taxes.
</P>
<P>
The region enjoys a low tariff policy in foreign trade and
financial subsidies and preferential loan rates.
</P>
<P>
Education is free in the Tibet Autonomous Region. All costs for
Tibetan students, from primary school to university, are covered
by the government. Since 1985, Tibet middle schools and classes in
the Tibetan language have been established in various other
provinces and cities for students from Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Family planning is not enforced among the farmers and herders
who make up 88 percent of the region's population, and the
government simply holds publicity campaigns to inform them about
more rational ways to have healthier children.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the regional government has advocated a policy of
two children per couple among Tibetan cadres, workers, and
employees of enterprises in cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
The government provided free medical care for all Tibetans for
more than 40 years. In November 1993, the State formulated a new
policy for free medical care for all farmers and herdsmen and part
of the urban residents. The average life expectancy of Tibetan
residents has risen from 36 years before liberation to 65 years.

<HEADLINE> Air Tanzania to Expand Fleet by Leasing Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned Air
Tanzania Corporation (ATC) will next week expand its fleet by
dry-leasing a Boeing 737-300 jet from Australia, managing director
of the company said.
</P>
<P>
Dominic Rwehumbiza, said Saturday that with a four-year lease
period, the aircraft will play an important role in expanding the
company's air services.
</P>
<P>
He sad the aircraft will enable ATC to look into developing new
routes or increasing frequencies on popular routes, adding that
the plane will also boost the ATC staff morale.
</P>
<P>
A once vigorous flag carrier with a nine-aircraft fleet
monopolizing the domestic market, the 20-year-old ATC currently
owns only two Boeing 737-200 and one Forkker Friendship 27 and
covers only 70 percent of the market share.
</P>
<P>
ATC decided last December to reduce 135 from a staff of 658 in
the first quarter of this year to improve the competitiveness in
the market.
</P>
<P>
Rwehumbiza explained that ATC decided to lease the aircraft due

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Thanks Kuwait for Prisoner Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein has expressed appreciation of Kuwait's release of the last
eight Jordanian prisoners held since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
In a message to Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah dated
Saturday, Abdullah hailed Kuwait's "kind move (to release the
prisoners) as a great step to strengthen bilateral relations
between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The Jordanians have been kept in Kuwaiti jails since the 1991
Gulf War for alleged collaboration with Iraqi forces. Jordan sided
with Iraq after President Saddam Hussein's troops stormed into
Kuwait on August 2, 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti emir's decision to free the Jordanian prisoners
was apparently a goodwill gesture to Jordan, which is embarking on
a fast track to improve relations with the gulf emirate.
</P>
<P>
Their bilateral relations began to thaw in 1995 when Amman
distanced itself from Baghdad and called for political changes in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait also extended an invitation to Jordanian Foreign
Minister Abdul Ilah al-Khatib in January to visit Kuwait as the
last step to normalize ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib is expected to leave Amman for Kuwait Tuesday to
reopen the Jordanian embassy in Kuwait, which has been closed
since the Gulf War.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Government
announced on Sunday that "a total victory" for Operation Sunset on
the Badme front was achieved by Ethiopian defense forces from
Tuesday to Friday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Office of Ethiopian Government
Spokesperson Selome Taddesse quoted the Central Military Command
as saying that a total victory for Ethiopian defense forces was
achieved on Friday and was consolidated Saturday on the Badme
front.
</P>
<P>
The Office said the Eritrean troops "have been totally routed
out of the (Badme) area" and "this area has been freed".
</P>
<P>
The Office said, during the 4-day operation, the Ethiopian
ground and air forces "captured, killed and wounded tens of
thousands of enemy army personnel"; "destroyed many tanks and
heavy artillery and captured several"; and "shot down two MIG-29
fighter planes".
</P>
<P>
The contested Badme area was occupied by Eritrean troops on May
12, 1998. The framework agreement approved last December by the
Central Organ Summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution
called for withdrawal of Eritrean troops from the Badme area.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Warn of Steam Bursts in Philippines' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) Sunday warned residents at
the perimeter of Taal Volcano in Batangas as well as visitors
against venturing inside the volcano's main crater "as sudden
steam bursts or phreatic explosions may occur."
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued by Phivolcs after another mud sputtering
activity was observed Saturday at the 1999 reactivated vent of the
volcano in the northern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The mud sputtering activity was observed between 10:30 and
13:00 Saturday, according to the Taal Volcano Update report
released Sunday by Phivolcs.
</P>
<P>
The report said spewed mud reached a height of about four
meters and was associated with steam emission that reached a much
higher altitude ranging from 40 to 50 meters.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this activity, the report said, only weak steaming
persisted at the vent.
</P>
<P>
Similar to the previous events, no volcanic tremor had
accompanied the activity as revealed by the seismic network at
Taal Volcano, it said.
</P>
<P>
Thermal measurements inside the main crater will be conducted
Sunday to determine any change in the temperature of the vent,
Phivolcs said.

<HEADLINE> Reconciliation Policy May Be Revisited: Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has warned that the government may have to revisit the
policy of reconciliation as some sections of society continue to
reject it and deliberately incite division among the people.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe gave the warning Saturday while addressing hundreds of
people including cabinet ministers and diplomats who gathered in
Bindura, north Zimbabwe, to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the
21st February Movement.
</P>
<P>
This year's theme for the movement is "Youth for Positive
Living." The campaign is targeted at getting rid of diseases,
ignorance, poverty, defeatism and despair.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Sunday Mail, Mugabe said, "If they
do not do that we may go back and remove the clothes of
reconciliation. But this means that there will be no understanding
each other. We will always shout at each other and this should not
be the message for our children."
</P>
<P>
He also lashed out at journalists from certain sections of the
private media saying that these journalists had lost their
identity and self- respect.
</P>
<P>
"For some, and those with no or little national pride, Zimbabwe
is now hell on earth and the grass is always greener outside our
borders. Others have become such willing puppets of the racist
enemies of Zimbabwe that they even call for our international
isolation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the country has some people who support the enemy
while the nation's soldiers are engaged in battles. "It makes one
wonder what has happened to that patriotism that some of us
suffered or died for in order to bring the freedom and dignity we
enjoy today."
</P>
<P>
He also said the spirit of reconciliation is against all forms
of discrimination, stressing schools must accept all children
regardless of their color and religion.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Seeks Increased Foreign Investment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China plans to introduce a
series of measures this year to expand the use of foreign
investment in order to offset the repercussions of the financial
crisis engulfing Asia.
</P>
<P>
The policy on overseas investment will remain basically
unchanged amidst the uncertainty of international environment and
China will focus on the use of foreign direct investment (FDI),
according to officials with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Plans also call for China to open more fields to foreign
investors. For example, pilot joint ventures in the retail sales
sector will be established in a number cities in central and
western China to supplement existing ventures in Shanghai and
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors will be encouraged to establish joint foreign
trade companies in central and western China, as well as in a
dozen coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of shares foreign investors are allowed to hold
in air transport companies will be increased and the government
will encourage more pilot joint companies in the accounting
service, appraisal, commodity inspection and quality control
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Multinational companies will be one of the main targets for
attracting increased foreign investment. MOFTEC has instructed
local departments to formulate specific preferential policies to
encourage multinational companies to invest in various areas,
including the high technology sector. Related departments will
also help multinationals establish regional research and
development centers in China.
</P>
<P>
Multinational companies with existing investments in China will
be encouraged to expand their product lines and upgrade technical
levels.

<P>
MOFTEC will seize every possible opportunity to promote
cooperation between small- to medium-sized domestic and foreign
companies, and will encourage Chinese companies to produce parts
for foreign-funded ventures.
</P>
<P>
Private companies will be encouraged to use foreign investments
under the guidance of MOFTEC.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a number of pilot development zones in central and
western China will be designated as model zones to effectively
boost foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
China will strengthen its diversification strategy in
attracting foreign investment, and accelerate efforts to establish
cooperative ties with international investment promotion agencies.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC will also introduce a number of new approaches to
attract investments, including specialized canvassing in
conjunction with investment promotion companies, sending
investment groups abroad, stationing resident representatives in
major investor nations and expanding use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC officials are cautiously optimistic about this year's
expanded use of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"China will face great difficulty in attracting foreign
investments during 1999," said MOFTEC Assistant Minister Ma
Xiuhong. "Nonetheless, foreign investments should remain on a
relatively large scale due to the attractiveness of the nation's
political and social stability, stable currency and rapid economic
growth," according to the assistant minister. Ma made the comments
earlier this year during a meeting with trade officials.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Official: Peace Options With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Peace options between the
Philippine government and rebel groups remain open "because the
government is committed to pursue peace with them," a senior
official said Sunday in the southern General Santos City.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican gave this assurance in the
wake of the aborted Saturday meeting between President Joseph
Estrada and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) leader Hashim
Salamat set in Cotabato City, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Barican, who is with President Estrada in General Santos City
for a visit, said that a meeting between the president and the
MILF leader will likely be scheduled, only if it is recommended by
the presidential adviser on the peace process, former Ambassador
Manuel Yan.
</P>
<P>
"The president is willing to talk peace if that is recommended
by Ambassador Yan and that could get the process moving," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barican clarified, however, that the MILF has not signified any
intention to have its leaders meet with the president and no
formal plans have been set for the possible meeting
</P>
<P>
Peace initiatives with the Moro rebels recently suffered
serious setbacks resulting from armed clashes between the MILF and
government forces in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"The president is willing to meet (with Salamat), if there's an
agenda. The president is willing to meet if that's what it takes
to get the process moving," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's meeting between the two leaders was canceled because
of disputes over security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
But an MILF official said earlier that the two leaders will
meet at a later date and the date, venue and security arrangement
for the meeting have been set by the two sides.

DAR ES SALAAM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council has called on the international community to
assist African countries in hosting refugees.
</P>
<P>
A report by the the UN Security Council said that African
states should be supported to ensure security in refugee camps and
settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam-based Sunday Observer quoted the report as

elements, curtailing the flow of arms and separating refugees from
other persons who are not under international protection.

<P>
The report reaffirmed the primary responsibility of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), with the
assistance of other international organizations to help African
states safeguard the due rights of refugees.
</P>
<P>
African states should also develop institutions and procedures
to implement the provisions of international law relating to the
status and treatment of refugees, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The UNHCR, other relevant bodies and organizations, member
states, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and sub-regional
organizations should initiate coordinated programs to provide
advice, training and technical or other assistance to African
States which host refugee populations," the report said.

BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China's extraordinary
diplomatic moves from the beginning of the year demonstrate its
determined efforts to weave an all-round diplomacy policy.
</P>
<P>
This will be further boosted when President Jiang Zemin kicks
off his state visit to three European nations soon, while Premier
Zhu Rongji returned home this morning after a four-day official
visit to Russia while Vice-President Hu Jintao paid a successful
visit to four African countries late last month.
</P>
<P>
"The more friends the better" -- an old Chinese saying often
quoted by Chinese leaders on diplomatic occasions is an essential
ingredient of the country's independent foreign policy of peace,
and has been fully reflected in the partnerships forged between
China and Western countries as well as with developing countries
which maintain the traditional friendships and cooperation with
China.
</P>
<P>
Yan Xuetong, a research fellow of the China Institute of
Contemporary International Relations, said that as a developing
large country, China must take into consideration its relations
with other big nations, and shoulder its international obligations
and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Yan went on, as the largest developing
country in the world, China should safeguard the rights and
interests of developing countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
This new form of partnership, which has often been quoted by
news media in recent years, has indeed instilled new impetus into
international relations and especially ties among big nations.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the cold war, nations have been working to
seek a new way of getting along with each other, and the
establishment of a new pattern of partnership plays a positive
role in shaping a modern world structure, as it is based on shared
interests, and based on consultation on an equal footing, seeking
common ground while reserving differences and not targeting any
third party.
</P>
<P>
China has played a major role through the whole process by
working hard to set up varying partnerships with other nations
over the past years.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia decided to establish and develop a strategic
and cooperative partnership into the 21st century in April 1996;
Since then, China has decided to establish a long-term
comprehensive partnership with France; to establish a constructive
strategic partnership with the United States and to develop a
comprehensive partnership with Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China and Japan made considerable effort in
developing a friendly and cooperative partnership devoted to peace
and development at the end of last year, during President Jiang
Zemin's state visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The relations between China and regional organizations have
also been cemented by this new mode and manner of partnership. The
leaders of China and the European Union (EU) held their first
meeting last year, during which the two sides decided to set up a
long-term, stable and constructive partnership for the new century.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the good-neighborly partnership of mutual trust
between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (
ASEAN) has been growing steadily.

<P>
The establishment and growth of such partnerships has benefited
from the rapid development of China's national strength and its
correct foreign policy. And China has been highly praised by the
international community because of its responsible attitude and
constructive role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
From the Asian financial crisis to the nuclear crisis in South
Asia, and from the Iraqi weapons inspection crisis to the Kosovo
crisis, China has played an indispensable role in maintaining
regional and global peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said that China's
peaceful and responsible image has been more noticeable through
its stand for the peaceful settlement of the international
conflict by consultations as well as through its opposition to
resorting to force or the threat of it.
</P>
<P>
China has also participated in and pushed the international
disarmament process since the beginning of the 1990s. The country
cut its armed forces manpower strength by 500,000 in 1997 in
addition to the previous reduction of one million in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, China has joined about 70 multi-lateral
international treaties, including the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty and the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believe that as China becomes more stronger and
prosperous, it will take up more responsibilities. As a
responsible partner, China will contribute more to world peace,
stability and development in the 21st century, and become a major
pillar of world peace.

who is representing Rahim, told the three-member panel.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry resumed Sunday to enable Anwar, who testified on
Tuesday, to continue with his evidence by answering questions from
counsel representing various individuals.
</P>
<P>
Questioned by Teh, Anwar denied that he had provoked Rahim and
explained that there was absolutely no conversation at all at the
lock-up in Bukit Aman on the night he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on September 2 and arrested on September 20 for allegedly
leading an unlawful assembly, appeared at the Sessions Court on
September 29 with the infamous black eye and claimed he had been
beaten unconscious while in police custody.
</P>
<P>
Rahim resigned as Inspector-General of Police On January 7, two
days after Attorney-General Mohtar Abdullah said in his statement
that the police were responsible for injuries sustained by Anwar
on certain parts of his body.

OTTAWA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Takeshi Honda of Japan overcame
an injured ankle to win the ISU Four Continents figure skating
championships in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Saturday.
</P>

<P>
The 17-year-old Honda was ranked 11th in the world last year.

Li's second-place was a remarkable achievement for a male
skater from China, whose men have yet to establish themselves in
the top echelon of international competition.

"When I finished I was so overwhelmed and saw it as a big
success for me," Li said. "I heard the support of the audience and
it helped me a lot."

HONG KONG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Charies Tangus of Kenya,
marathon powerhouse, won the men's title at 2:17:00 in the record-
breaking Standard Chartered Marathon 1999 in Hong Kong on Sunday.

"I am very happy to win the title," said 24-year-old Tangus,

<P>
"I expected to get a better result, but unfortunately I had
loose bowels this morning," she said.
</P>
<P>
"However, I am satisfied with my time," added Zheng.
</P>
<P>
Tangus, who finished sixth at 1997 Boston Marathon, turned out
to lead from the leading group, mostly are Kenyans, at 29km but he
was caught up in the last kilometer by his compatriot Mbarak

<HEADLINE> IMF Increases Quota Subscription for Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has increased Sri Lanka's quota subscription from 303.6
million Special Drawing Rights (SDR) (about 412.4 million U.S.
dollars) to SDR 413.4 million (560 million Dollars) as part of the
overall strategy of increasing its members' quotas, said an IMF
release available Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's Executive Board passed a resolution proposing a 45
percent increase in the total IMF quotas to SDR 212 billion (about
288 billion U.S. dollars) from SDR 146 billion (about 199 billion
dollars), said the release.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the overall quota increase reflects the
changes since the last quota increase in 1990 in the size of the
world economy, the scale of potential payments imbalances, and the
rapid globalization and liberalization of trade and payments,
including the capital account.
</P>
<P>
Members' quota subscriptions constitute the largest source of
money at the IMF's disposal.
</P>
<P>
Members pay 25 percent of their quota subscriptions in hard
currencies, the rest in their own domestic currency. As of July
1998, the IMF's currency holdings through quota subscriptions
amounted to 195 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IMF conducts a quota review every five years to see whether
they need to be adjusted in light of the growth of the world
economy and changes in individual country's economic positions.

DHAKA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people, including a
woman and a six-month-old baby, were burnt alive in a devastating
fire in the Bangladeshi capital on Saturday, press reports here
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The fire also injured over 50 others and razed at least 5,000
shanties at a slum in the city's Agargaon area, leaving about
20,000 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
The blaze originated from an earthen oven at about 11:40 a.m.
local time at the northwest end of one of the biggest slums in the
city, housing about 12,000 shanties, fire brigade sources were
quoted as saying. Firefighters took over one hour to extinguish
the fire.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the fire started, it spread to surrounding thatched
houses, engulfing the little huts, home to over 30,000 people,
mostly from the low-income group.
</P>
<P>
Home Minister Rafiqul Islam and Dhaka City Mayor Mohammad Hanif
visited the site after the fire, and relief materials were
sanctioned among the slum dwellers.

<HEADLINE> Greater Gold Reserves Needed In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China should increase its gold
reserves to hedge against financial risks, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
A diversification of the nation's foreign exchange reserves,
the bulk of which are now in U.S. dollars, is also necessary, Liu
Shan'en, deputy director of the Gold Economic Development Research
Center, was quoted by today's Business Weekly as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If there are problems with the dollar, there will be an
international catastrophe," Liu said. "Reducing reliance on the
dollar and maintaining greater variety in foreign reserves is the
only way to reduce the risk."
</P>
<P>
According to International Monetary Fund statistics, China's
gold reserves stood at 395 tons at the end of 1997, accounting for
only 2.6 percent of the total reserves. That proportion contrasts
sharply with Germany's gold reserve ratio of 34 percent or France'
s 55 percent at that time.
</P>
<P>
Some experts say China should allow Chinese residents to buy
and sell gold freely. At present, they are prohibited from dealing
in gold bullion and can only buy gold in the form of jewelry and
other ornaments through retail stores.
</P>
<P>
China's gold industry is undergoing progressive deregulation,
and official pricing is now based on the international price.
</P>
<P>
"Deregulation is one of the keys to unlocking the real
potential for increased gold demand in China," said Kerr
Cruikshanks, chief executive officer of Far East operations of the
World Gold Council.

<HEADLINE> Conflicts Continue in Kosovo During Peace Talk Adjournment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Bloody conflicts continued in
Kosovo Saturday after the Rambouillet peace talks were adjourned,
leaving at least one policeman dead.
</P>
<P>
The policeman was shot to death and another was seriously
wounded on a road in Pristina Saturday afternoon when a police
patrol vehicle was attacked, news from the Pristina Information
Center said.
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday morning, an ethnic Albanian said to be missing
four days ago was found dead in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Army killed two Kosovo Liberation Army members in
self-defense Friday afternoon when armed ethnic Albanians made a
surprise attack on the Yugoslav Army.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Vojislav Seselj, deputy prime minister of the
Serbian Republic, said however great the pressure from the outside,
no Serbian would sign agreements that would separate Kosovo from
Serbia and allow foreign military presence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
At a mass rally in Belgrade Saturday, Seselj said the Serbian
government would firmly defend Kosovo, never give up Kosovo and
never allow foreign troops to station on Yugoslav territory.
</P>
<P>
He also warned neighboring countries, especially Macedonia, not
to "play with fire" and not to allow NATO (North Atlantic Treaty
Organization) troops to attack Serbia from their territory.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Bulls coach Tim

fine of $5,000 for verbally abusing the officials following his
ejection from Thursday's home loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
Portland Trail Blazers guard Isaiah Rider was suspended one

also was his 45th birthday.
</P>
<P>
He drew technical fouls about 10 seconds apart and came onto
the court to argue with referee Bill Spooner. Floyd could be seen
mouthing expletives toward the referee.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Refutes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Foreign Ministry
Spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh refuted the annual human rights report
of the U.S. State Department by saying that the U.S. human rights
report is not impartial in commenting on the human rights
situation in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Thanh was answering foreign media men to comment on the report
in Hanoi on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that it is regrettable that at a time when the
Vietnam-U.S. relations are experiencing new developments, the
report is not impartial with regard to Vietnam and is inimical to
the promotion of Vietnam-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating Vietnam's position on human rights, Thanh said that
Vietnam, once a victim of the violation of the most basic human
rights, has developed a legal system and provisions to first and
foremost ensure to the Vietnamese people the rights to live in
independence and freedom.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that such freedoms of the individual as
freedoms of speech, of the press, of assembly, of demonstration,
and of worship are specified in Vietnam's constitution and are
ensured in practice.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese spokeswoman further said that in order to ensure
the interests of the community, the Vietnamese state strictly
punishes those who intentionally violate the law and the rights
and interests of other people and of the community as a whole. She
reaffirmed that in Vietnam there are no political, and religious
prisoners, but only prisoners convicted for breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
Thanh added that it is not in conformity with international
practice for a country to reserve by itself the right to assess
the situation of human rights in other countries.

<HEADLINE> Meeting Between Estrada, Rebel Leader Reset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada and rebel leader Hashim Salamat will meet at a later date
after a meeting scheduled for Saturday aborted.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Bulletin Sunday quoted Ghaazali Jaafar, vice
chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) as saying
that he and President Estrada's personal emissary have already
fixed the date of the meeting, the venue, as well as the security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to give any details, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"We have just concluded this morning (Saturday morning) the
one-one meeting between President Estrada and Chairman Salamat,
but we cannot reveal the details of that meeting to avoid the
repetition of the canceled meeting between the two leaders,"
Jaafar said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada and Salamat were scheduled to meet in Cotabato City,
Mindanao, Saturday, to discuss peace in the south, but the meeting
was canceled because of disputes over security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said that the new date, venue and the security
arrangements have been approved by President Estrada.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, the 12,000-strong MILF has been fighting
for an independent Islamic state in the south. But the government
insisted that the territorial integrity should not be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said Saturday that any talks with the MILF
and other rebel groups could only focus on peace and development
in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Mexican President Calls for efforts to Curb Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo Saturday called on his nationals to prevent forest fires
and to recover forested areas lost until now.
</P>
<P>
He said 14,445 fires broke out last year, affecting more than
582,000 hectares of land. Of the total 405,000 were ecological
forest systems and the rest grassland.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 there were 78 million hectares of forested land, and
now only 53 million, and in less than 50 years the country has
lost almost one third of its forests and jungles, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to stop the extinction of the forests and jungles,"
Zedillo said. "We cannot permit this wealth to continue being
destroyed, which our children and all the future generations of
Mexico need."
</P>
<P>
Among the causes of the destruction, he said, are the
population growth and irrational destruction of the forest
resources, as well as the primitive methods for land cultivation,
such as the cutting of trees and burning of grass to prepare the
soil for sowing.
</P>
<P>
The president warned the impact of the forest destruction has
started to be felt, citing as an example the bad weather that
affected the southern state of Chiapas last September due to the
cutting of trees and the erosion in the higher lands of that
region.
</P>
<P>
As for the official move in forest protection, the president
said protected natural areas of 955,000 hectares of jungles and
forests have been created, and this year and the next another 660,
000 hectares will be added.
</P>
<P>
The National Reforestation Program will be promoted more
dynamically, under which 100 million trees were planted in 674,000
hectares, and there are plans to plant 285,000 more trees before
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The National Fire Prevention Program is already in force and a
big budget has been allocated to it, he said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Cultivate More Poppy-Substitute Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is planning to
cultivate 810 hectares more Japanese buckwheat, a kind of
poppy-substitute crop, in Kokang's Laukkai area in northern Shan
state of the country as part of its efforts to eradicate narcotic
drugs.
</P>
<P>
Other crops such as paddy, sugarcane, lychee and apple will
also be included in the cultivation.
</P>
<P>
First Secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt and three members of the
Japanese House of Representatives Koichi Kato, Yoshio Mochizuki
and Hiroshi Moriyama jointly observed the preparatory works of the
plan in Laukkai on Saturday, official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has begun last December commercial production of
Japanese buckwheat in Kokang's Ta Shwe Tang area following the
successful implementation of a Japanese-proposed pilot project of
the production in the area with more than 93 hectares of the
crops harvested.
</P>
<P>
Japan had reached a memorandum of understanding with Myanmar on
buying all the buckwheat produced.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimation, in the 1998-99 fiscal year
ending in March, a total of 5,898 hectares could be placed under
poppy substitute crops including paddy, corn, sugarcane and
Japanese buckwheat.
</P>
<P>
And in 1999 and 2000, it is targeted that a total of 4,916
hectares could also be put under paddy, wheat, coffee seedlings
and rubber cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has worked out a 15-year plan (1999-2014) for total
elimination of narcotic drugs, initiating the move in 48 townships
in the country which cover those in Shan, Kachin, Kayah and Chin
states after successful transformation of eastern Shan state's
Mongla region into an opium-free zone in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
The total budget expenditure for the 15-year plan is estimated
as 5.613 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka and the United
States have concluded a new extradition treaty to replace the one
that existed since 1931, Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The negotiated text of the treaty was initialed in Washington
last week by Sri Lankan Ambassador Warnasena Rasaputram and U.S.
State Department legal advisor David Andrews, the Sunday Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The new treaty replaces the pre-independence treaty between
the U.S. and Britain signed at London on December 22, 1931, which
was then applied to Ceylon (the former name of Sri Lanka), " the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The need for a new extradition treaty between the two countries
was first raised by Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman
Kadirgamar during his official visit to Washington D.C. in October
1997.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and Sri Lanka recognized the need for a
new treaty for the reciprocal surrender of offenders between the
two countries, which takes into account the current developments
in the law, the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Report Says Agreement on Marcos Wealth Initiated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
initiated a parallel agreement with the Philippine National Bank
(PNB) and the counsel of the five Marcos foundations to effect the
release of 150 million U.S. dollars to the 1,000 victims of the
Marcos rule.
</P>
<P>
According to a Today newspaper report Sunday, the money will
come from the recovered 540-million-dollar (now 590 million
dollars with interests) Marcos Swiss accounts held in an escrow in
the PNB.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Chairman Magdangal Elma of the
Presidential Commission on Good Government, PNB Vice President
Jose Ferro and Lawyer Patrick Feotish of Marcos foundations, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
However, it quoted the lawyer of the victims as saying that the
release of the money to the victims will depend on the following
conditions:
</P>
<P>
-- The compromise agreement signed between the victims' lawyers
and the family of late President Ferdinand Marcos must be signed
and approved by President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
-- There must be a certification by the bank where the money
will be deposited that in the event that the final approval will
not be issued or attained, then the money will have to be sent to
its point of origin.
</P>
<P>
-- The court, which has jurisdiction over the
590-million-dollar Marcos Swiss deposits, must also approve the
deal.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The National Democratic Front
(NDP), one of the major rebel groups in the Philippines, has
threatened to completely withdraw from the stalled peace talks
initiated six years ago by the previous administration.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published here Sunday, the NDP said: "The
"national leadership of the NDP is now seriously considering to
terminate its peace negotiations with the government."
</P>
<P>
The rebel group blamed President Joseph Estrada for the
complete breakdown of the peace negotiations between the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
"In one act of impulsiveness, Mr. Estrada has destroyed the
work of so many years," it said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada suspended the peace talks with the NDP last Wednesday
following the abduction of a army general, a captain and a police
officer by the New People's Army, the armed wing of the NDP, in
the past week.
</P>
<P>
The NDP said that the statement was meant to explain in advance
why the NDP is considering the termination of the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Deposits Insurance System Called For In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Establishment of a deposits
insurance system will be beneficial to the stability of China's
financial system as a whole, economists say.
</P>
<P>
China needs to introduce such a mechanism to tackle financial
risks, Wang Guogang, deputy director of the financial research
center of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, was quoted by
today's Business Weekly as saying.
</P>
<P>
The deposits insurance system, under which savings deposits in
banks are guaranteed by insurance companies, gives top priority to
the interests of depositors, protecting them from the vagaries of
the market economy.
</P>
<P>
Individual savers will feel reassured of the safety of their
money in banks that are protected by deposits insurance, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese banks have implemented a deposits reserves system,
under which they set aside a certain amount of funds in the
central bank in case of failure in the ability to repay the
savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
But this is insufficient in view of the pace of the nation's
banking reform, Wang said.

<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The newly established
Guangzhou Branch of the People's Bank of China has decided to make
the areas under its supervision a financially safe zone.
</P>
<P>
Founded in December last year, the branch is one of the nine
regional branches of the central bank set up as a consequence of
the bank's overall structural reorganization, according to today's
Business Weekly. It covers the provinces of Guangdong and Hainan,
as well as the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The branch is to improve financial supervision and financial
services, and steadily push forward financial reform and opening-
up on the basis of prevention of financial risks, said branch
governor Jiang Chaoliang.
</P>
<P>
A two-year program to improve financial supervision regulations,
management mechanisms, and financial risk warning, monitoring and
controlling systems is being implemented.
</P>
<P>
Major efforts are to be directed towards completing the
supervision mechanism for rural co-operatives, strengthening
investigation of the asset quality of wholly-owned state
commercial banks, monitoring and controlling the liquidity and
payment capability of urban commercial banks, enhancing the
supervision and management of issuance and cashing of corporate
bonds, and suppressing illegal financial institutions and
activities.
</P>
<P>
The branch will also improve the management of foreign exchange
business to fend off overseas financial risks.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Sporadic clashes continued in
the destroyed Ambon city, capital of Indonesia's Maluku province,
on Saturday and at least five more people were injured.
</P>
<P>
"Four are Christians and one is Muslim. They have bruises and
stab wounds, and two are still being treated in hospital,"
Abdurrahman, a staffer at the police Bhayangkara Hospital said.
</P>
<P>
Wawan, a member of staff at the downtown Al Fattah Mosque, said
that Muslim houses in Ahuru village were set on fire by Christians
early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Reports have just come indicating that security personnel
fired warning shots to disperse crowds in the area," Wawan was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wawan said that angry mobs were also burning houses on the
boundary of the villages of Ahuru and Waihoka on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Warning shots have also been fired as people there refused to
lay down their weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wawan also said there were reports of attacks on the state-run
Islamic Studies Institute in the Air Besar area of the city.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the situation in the city was still tense on
Saturday as shops and schools remained closed and public
transportation was still not running.
</P>
<P>
At least 16 have been killed in renewed clashes with religious
overtones which broke out Tuesday in the downtown Batu Merah
village.
</P>
<P>
Thousands have taken refuge in churches, mosques and military
installations since the violence broke out on Tuesday while
thousands of others have fled the city on ships for their
hometowns in Southeast Sulawesi and South Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
Ambon and several other islands in Maluku province have been
the scene of violent clashes between Muslims and Christians groups
since mid-January which have left at least 127 people dead and
caused massive damage.
</P>
<P>
The violence was initially sparked by a dispute between a
Muslim migrant and a local Christian driver of a public minibus on
January 19.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim. Maluku is a
pre-dominantly Christian province.

<HEADLINE> China's Apple Juice Exports Have Agreed Minimum Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China's apple juice export
sector is expected to be brought under better control as the
result of a self-regulatory agreement concluded by the country's
major exporters.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting held recently by the China Chamber of Commerce for
Import and Export of Foodstuffs, Native Products and Animal By-
products, major apple juice exporters agreed minimum export prices
for various apple juice products, the "Business Weekly" reported
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
All apple juice exporters will have to raise their prices above
the agreed minimums or face sanctions from the Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the move was initiated after the
United States hinted it was considering launching an anti-dumping
investigation against apple juice imports from China, the world's
top apple producer.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics showed that China's apple juice exports to
the US have increased 10-fold in the past three years, while the
average price has dropped by 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
This was caused by the Chinese apple juice exporters who have
undercut each other in order to grab more share of the world
market.
</P>
<P>
The price cutting among Chinese apple juice exporters has not
only disrupted the market order, but also severely hurt China's
apple juice exporters themselves.
</P>
<P>
"The price increase for exported apple juice products will
greatly alleviate the pressure on Chinese apple juice exporters,"
said an official with the China Chamber of Commerce for Imports
and Exports of Foodstuffs, Native Produce and Animal By-products.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed the worry that the united price-rising action
will hurt the competitivity of Chinese apple juice products, which
he said would still be cheaper than those of similar quality from
other countries.

<HEADLINE> Ocalan Refuses Italy's Arrangement, Says Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan had refused an Italian government offer to take him to a
third country which would have granted him asylum, said Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the German weekly Der Spiegel,
D"Alema said Ocalan preferred to remain in Europe in order to
continue his political activities after his Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) lost its bases in the Near East.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema told the German weekly in an interview that Italy had
found a "safe haven" for Ocalan, but he preferred to place his
confidence elsewhere. "We acted in a truly honest, legal and open
way," the Italian premier said.
</P>
<P>
But D'Alema declined to say which country had offered to give
the PKK leader asylum because "this would place a friend nation in
jeopardy."
</P>
<P>
He said there is a clear and single European position on the
Kurdish issue -- the question must be resolved in a peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan arrived in Italy from Moscow in mid-November of last
year seeking political asylum. Italy first arrested him on a
warrant issued by Germany but then freed him after Bonn refused to
seek his extradition.
</P>
<P>
Extradition requests from Turkey were turned down by Rome
because the PKK leader risked the death penalty. Ocalan left Italy
on January 16 only to fall into Turkish hands a month later in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan is currently being questioned by three prosecutors on
the Turkish prison island of Imrali, which has been declared a
prohibited area. He is expected to be tried on charges of treason
for which the Turkish penal code stipulates capital punishment.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Real Stops Dropping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The steep drop of the
Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar in the past four days
practically stopped Saturday when the Senate approved the
appointment of Arminio Fraga as the new Central Bank president.
</P>
<P>
The confidence with which Fraga answered the senators'
questions, the bank decision to sell dollars in the market to
detain speculative pressures and the central bank monitoring of
the exchange boards of the main investment banks in the country
braked the dollar appreciation, economic analysts said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar, which opened at 2.06 reals Friday, finally closed
at 2.04 reals after the Senate Economic Affairs Commission
confirmed Fraga's appointment with 21 votes for and seven against.
</P>
<P>
"The day was peaceful, since the bank's overseeing prevented
panic and hysteria. The rate of exchange closed at a value under
that of Thursday," said acting Central Bank President Demosthenes
Madureira.
</P>
<P>
The stock markets in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro also showed
their upward trend Friday. The Sao Paulo market ended the day
with a gain of 2.72 percent and the Rio market with 2.50 percent.

BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- China's top legislative body Saturday started to deliberate
the agenda of the upcoming Second Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC). Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing
Committee, presided over the eighth meeting of the standing
committee.
</P>
<P>
The second session of the Ninth NPC, which is scheduled to open
on March 5, will examine the government work report to be
delivered by Premier Zhu Rongji, as well as the amendments to
China's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
-- The Standing Committee of the Ninth National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
yesterday started its fourth meeting in Beijing. The meeting
decided that the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National
Committee will start in Beijing on March 3.
</P>
<P>
"Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- China and Vietnam Saturday issued a joint statement in
Beijing, saying that the consolidation and positive development of
friendly and cooperative ties between the two countries are in
their fundamental interests and can benefit peace, stability,
cooperation and development in the region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement was issued during a six-day official
goodwill visit to China by Le Kha Phieu, general secretary of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, at the
invitation of Jiang Zemin, Chinese President and Party general
secretary.
</P>
<P>
Phieu arrived in Beijing last Thursday and left here for
Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, on the
second leg of his visit on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
-- The statement made by Hong Kong's highest court last Friday
is necessary to clarify its previous abode right judgment, said a
spokesman of the Commission of Legislative Affairs of the NPC
Standing Committee in an interview with the press Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On January 29, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) ruled that
mainland children born to Hong Kong permanent residents had the
right of abode in the territory, whether or not the parents were
married or they were residents at the time the children were born.
</P>
<P>
-- The families of 13 people who died in the plane crash in
east China's Zhejiang Province on February 24 will each get 200,
000 yuan (about 25,000 US dollars) in compensation from the People'
s Insurance Company of China and its three local branches.
</P>
<P>
The crash of the Tu-154 China Southwest Airlines plane killed
all 61 people on board, including 50 passengers and 11 crew
members.

<P>
Only 13 of the 50 passengers had bought life insurance policies.
China Southwest Airlines has also worked out a compensation
package of 70,000 yuan to each of the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
 "China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese financial analysts say that China should increase
its gold reserves to hedge against financial risks.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, China's gold reserves, which according to
International Monetary Fund statistics totaled 395 tons,
represented only 2.6 percent of total reserves (priced at US$300
an ounce).
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese economists say that Chinese banks should face up to
market realities and work for the establishment of a deposits
insurance system, which will be beneficial to the stability of the
financial system as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The deposits insurance system, under which savings deposits in
banks are guaranteed by insurance companies, has long been a
service in the United States and has spread to many other
countries.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Spain's Carlos Sainz won the
mountainous second leg of the Safari Rally on Saturday and
overtook the lead heading into Sunday's final stage.

<P>
Seven other drivers were eliminated in Saturday's grueling leg,
a 1,255-kilometer odyssey through the lava bends, mountains and
hairpin turns of Kenya's Rift Valley.
</P>
<P>
Sainz's cumulative time after two full days was six hours, 18

Lancer.
</P>
<P>
Piero Liatti of Italy was third another five minutes behind,
and was followed by Britain's Colin McRae and Ian Duncan of Kenya.
</P>
<P>

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Torrential rains
caused by the "La Nina" weather phenomenon were blamed for the
death of 11 children in Riosucio, the Choco Department of Colombia,
Governor Freddy Pino Lozano said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pino alerted the emergency committees about the situation
caused by the "La Nina" phenomenon characterized by a cooling of
the Pacific Ocean waters, which increased the rains in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Choco Department Government Secretary Higinio Mosquera said
earlier that in Riosucio, more than 500 houses were destroyed and
some 4,000 people had to be relocated.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 180 Sea Lions Found Dead in California Gulf </HEADLINE>

<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Environmental authorities
said Saturday that a group of experts found the carcasses of 180
sea lions in an island in the Gulf of California across the coasts
of Mexico's northwestern Sonora State last week.
</P>
<P>
The remains of the sea mammals were found in the San Jorge
Island on February 23 during a routine inspection in the northern
zone of the Gulf, said the Federal Environmental Protection Agency
(Profepa).
</P>
<P>
The Profepa experts took samples of the sea lions organs for
National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) researchers to
determine the causes of the deaths, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The authorities found four dead whales in the Mexican Pacific
coasts in January this year.
</P>
<P>
The most recent case of a mass death of marine mammals in the
Gulf of California was registered in 1996, when the experts
attributed the deaths to poisoning of crude oil and to the
presence of the red tide in the Gulf.

<TEXT>
<P>
"I will quit in summer. I realized over the past months that I
had to concentrate fully on tennis if I want to maintain my level.
I will get through it until summer and then that's the end,"
Becker told Der Spiegel news magazine in the interview made
available to the German Press Agency DPA ahead of publication.
</P>
<P>
Becker said he planned to continue playing until the Stuttgart
clay court tournament July 19-25.
</P>
<P>
Becker, 31, who briefly held the world number one position in
1991 and has a total 49 career titles, retired from Grand Slam
events after Wimbledon 1997.
</P>
<P>
As a part-timer he still plays at some tournaments, but after a
withdrawal in London has been the center of criticism because
organisers are fed up with him cancelling his appearance the third
straight time after Doha and Rotterdam earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
This was also criticised by the new German top player Tommy
Haas: "I don't like Boris' farewell. He signs in at tournaments
and then doesn't play. I don't know if that is good for the
spectators and tennis in general," said world number 16 Haas.
</P>
<P>
Off the court Becker is these days engaged as Davis Cup team
boss and head of a Mercedes Junior Team.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Hails Eritrea's Acceptance of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 27 (Xinhua) - The U.N. Security
Council on Saturday issued a statement, extending a welcome to the
Eritrean acceptance of a peace initiative put forward by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) to end its border dispute with
neighboring Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council welcomes the acceptance by Eritrea at the
Head of State level of the Organization of African Unity Framework
Agreement and recalls the prior acceptance of the agreement by
Ethiopia," said the statement, read to the press here by the
president of the Security Council for the month of February,
Robert Fowler of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The council issued the statement in a response to an official
letter from Eritrea's permanent representative to the United
Nations, Haile Menkerios, which said, "The government of Eritrea
accepts the OAU framework agreement to pave the way for an
expedited demarcation," of its border.
</P>
<P>
Menkerios said that the "Ethiopian government now occupies by
force Eritrean sovereign territory" in the conflict which U.N.
trouble-shooter Mohammed Sahnoun earlier this month called
"nonsensical and unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Eritrean ambassador, the 15-member U.N.
Security Council, meeting in an emergency session with the
presence of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, voiced its
immediate welcome to Eritrea's reversal of its earlier positions,
and called for both sides to stop fighting immediately.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council demands an immediate halt to all
hostilities and calls on the parties to refrain from the further
use of force," the council said in a statement issued at a formal
meeting attended by Secretary-General Kofi Annan"
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia previously accepted an OAU peace initiative which
called for Eritrea to withdraw to positions held before the
conflict erupted. Until Saturday, Eritrea asked for an
international monitoring force to be in place first.
</P>
<P>
The two East African neighbors in the Horn of Africa are
contesting a largely uninhabited, rocky 390 square-kilometer patch
of land in their 1,000-kilometer border that has never been
totally demarcated.
</P>
<P>
Fighting intensified since Tuesday with each side claiming to
have inflicted heavy loses on the other. In May and June more than
1,000 people were killed, after which unsuccessful negotiations
began. The fighting resumed on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
The Council on February 10 issued a similar appeal and also
urged nations to hal was not mandatory and diplomats said weapons
were still flowing into the region from eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun, at the time, said that both countries had acquired
fighter planes and bombers, adding that the world might "soon be
witnessing the first high-tech war in Africa."
</P>
<P>
Asked if Sahnoun, Annan's special Africa representative, would
return to the area, Fowler said it depended on developments on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
They noted Eritrea, with far less troops than Ethiopia, had put
most of its forces at the front.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Eritrean capital of Asmara said that Eritrean
troops beat a retreat in parts of Badme. Its radio contended more
than 9,000 Ethiopian fighters were killed in the last four days
after they broke through Eritrean defenses.
</P>
<P>
Menkerios, in his letter, said that Ethiopian troops advanced
some "10 kilometers into Eritrean territory beyond the disputed
Badme sector."
</P>
<P>
The February 6 breakout of the latest round of fighting in the
Horn of Africa has put an end to an eight-month stalemate after a
fierce war in May and June last year. Badme region was
administered by Ethiopia before May last year.
</P>
<P>
A string of foreign mediation efforts based on the OAU peace
plan have failed to broker a peaceful solution to the inter-state
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia, with Ethiopian
blessing, in May 1993 after a referendum.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The South African
national team gave their best performance on a home ground
Saturday when they thrashed Gabon 4-1 in the African Nations Cup
qualifier in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
This was one of the biggest win the side has registered in
international soccer, and it put South Africa firmly on top of its
group with seven points, South African media reported.
</P>
<P>
In earlier group clashes, South Africa beat Angola 1-0 at home
and drawn Mauritius in an away match.
</P>
<P>
Gabon went 1-0 ahead after striker Theodore Nguema found space
behind the South African defense and whipped a 20-meter shot into
the far corner in the 27th minute.
</P>
<P>
South Africa piled on the pressure and midfielder John Moeti
levelled the scores 1-all before the end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
The team took the lead in the 50th minute when striker Phil
Masinga launched a powerful shot past the Gabonese keeper.
</P>
<P>
South Africa went further ahead when strikers Shaun Bartlett
and Benedict McCarthy net the third and the fourth goal in the 57
th and 81th minutes.
</P>
<P>
Pleased with the team's performance, South African national
coach Trott Moloto said after the match that the squad were
showing signs of maturity and were getting their act together on
the international front.
</P>
<P>
"This is what I have expected from my players. We knew Gabon
would come at us with all cylinders firing but we were well
prepared," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the coach said there was still much work to be done,
as it would not be easy against Gabon in the return leg in
Libreville in April.
</P>
<P>
"But I know I have the soldiers to win this Nations Cup 'war',"
he added.
</P>
<P>
South Africa won the Nations Cup in 1996 and lost to Egypt two
years later in the final in Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Gabon coach Antonio Dumas praised South Africa's performance,
saying they were a very good side and would be a force to be
reckoned with for a long time.
</P>
<P>
But he said his team would have done better if he had all his
foreign-based players in his lineup.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United maintained
their leading place at the English Premier League with a 2-1
victory over Southampton on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Manchester United kept their four-point lead over
Chelsea thanks to late goals from Roy Keane and Dwight York. Matt
Le Tissier scored a last-minute consolation goal.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, who have a game in hand on Alex Ferguson's side,
stayed snapping at their heels as they outclassed Liverpool 2-1,
taking the lead through a Frank Leboeuf penalty and Bjarne
Goldbaek's third goal in two games.
</P>
<P>
Michael Owen got one back for ragged Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
United have 57 points from 28 games and Chelsea 53 from 27.
</P>
<P>
Only Arsenal, who are third on 49 points but with two games in
hand on United, look capable of providing a challenge for the
leading pair. They will look to get back in the race with a
victory over Newcastle on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Aston Villa failed to resurrect their title hopes as they were
thumped 4-1 by neighbours Coventry. John Aloisi and George Boateng
each scored twice.
</P>
<P>
Victory for Gordon Strachan's side moves them out of the
relegation zone. Blackburn slipped down to third from bottom after
a 2-0 defeat by West Ham.
</P>
<P>
Nottingham Forest managed to snatch a point against Charlton
but remain anchored in bottom place, six points behind Southampton.

<HEADLINE> Rusedski to Face Krajicek in London Indoor Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He will play Dutch player Richard Krajicek, who returned from
the funeral of a friend on Saturday to crush Thomas Johansson 6-2,
6-4.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek flew back from the Netherlands just hours before the
semi-final after attending the funeral of compatriot Menno Oosting,
a doubles specialist killed in a car accident earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
"The funeral was really emotional, it was really tough saying
goodbye," said Krajicek. "Maybe that's why I played so well today -
- I realised there were more important things than a tennis match.
"
</P>
<P>
Krajicek, the fourth seed, has yet to lose a set here and he
was in superb form against the Swedish eighth seed, especially on
his serve.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Rusedski almost matched Krajicek's commanding form
against Arazi. In a battle between two left-handers of vastly
different styles, the Canadian-born Briton was simply too strong
and consistent for his unseeded opponent whose normally reliable
touch deserted him for long periods.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski did not have to serve at full bore -- he hit just five
aces compared with 20 in his quarter-final against Thomas Enqvist -
- but he still won 90 percent of points where his first serve went
in.
</P>
<P>
John Lloyd reached the final of the London Indoor tournament
when it was at Wembley in 1977, before losing to Bjorn Borg.

<HEADLINE> Premier's Visit to Spur Bilateral Trade with Russia: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Russian bilateral trade
is expected to revive this year on the back of Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji's just-concluded visit to Russia, the "Business Weekly"
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Bilateral trade between China and Russia will definitely
surpass US$6 billion this year," Qin Xuanren, a senior researcher
from the Institute of Euro-Asian Social Development under the
Development Research Center of the State Council, was quoted as
saying by the English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Russian trade volume dropped to US$5.48 billion last year,
compared with US$6.12 billion in 1997. Bilateral trade has
fluctuated around a low level over recent years.
</P>
<P>
During Premier Zhu's official visit to Russia last week, China
and Russia signed 11 agreements on co-operation in economic and
trade, science and technology, transportation and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Inked at the end of the fourth regular meeting between the
prime ministers of the two countries, the documents also included
four accords on oil, natural gas and electricity.
</P>
<P>
China has traditionally exported daily consumption goods to
Russia and imported large quantities of machinery, electronics
products and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
But the complementarity between the two economies has been
reduced in recent years as a result of changes in demand in both
markets and industrial restructuring by both sides.
</P>
<P>
"As the general commodity trade between China and Russia is
suffering mounting difficulties, we will encourage and assist our
enterprises to explore new co-operation channels to tap the
Russian market," said an official from the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Accepts OAU Peace Plan After Border Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea on Saturday
voiced its willingness to accept a peace plan offered by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) to end its border dispute with
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Eritrea accepts the OAU framework agreement
to pave the way for an expedited demarcation," Eritrean Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Haile Menkerios said in a
letter to the U.N. Security Council, which called for an emergency
Saturday meeting of the 15-member body.
</P>
<P>
A Security Council session is going on here to discuss the
border dispute between the two warring nations in the Horn of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Before Saturday, Eriteria rejected the OAU-sponsored peace
initiative and the unexpected policy shift represents a welcome
step and followed the Eritrean admission that Ethiopia seized its
territory "by force."
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the president of the Security Council, Robert
Fowler of Canada, Menkerios said that Ethiopia "now occupies by
force Eriterian sovereign territory."
</P>
<P>
Fowler told Security Council members that Ethiopia had broken
through the Badme front on Friday and was about 9.6 kilometers
into Eritrean territory.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean letter called for a Security Council meeting to
ask the Council to lash out at Ethiopia's "aggression" and ensure
that observers are sent to "verify facts on the ground and
facilitate demarcation" of a border dispute between the two Horn
of African countries.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has accepted an OAU peace initiative which called for
Eritrea to withdraw its troops back to positions held before the
conflict erupted. Earlier, Eritrea turned down the peace plan,
asking for an international monitoring force to be in place first.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, which convened the unusual weekend
session with the presence of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, is
expected to issue a statement calling for an end to hostilities,
the withdrawal of troops from areas beyond their demarcated
regions, respect for ech country's territorial sovereignty and
welcoming Eritrea's acceptance of the peace plan, sources close to
the Security Council said.
</P>
<P>
In its previous relevant resolutions and statements, the
Security Council repeatedly called for an immediate ceasefire and
a halt to arms sales to both warring countries. The Council also
called on Eriteria to heed the peace proposal and to solve the
dispute through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries are locked in a dispute over
Badme border region, a barren, rocky and largely uninhabited
region which covers an area of 150 square kilometers. The common
border between the two nations has never been clearly demarcated
since Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia, with Ethiopian
blessing, in May 1993 after a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting broke out on February 6, putting
an end to an eight-month stalemate after a fierce war killed 1,000
people in May and June last year. Badme region was administered by
Ethiopia before May last year.
</P>
<P>
A string of foreign mediation efforts based on a peace plan
drawn up by the OAU have failed to broker a peaceful solution to
the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's New Budget Based on Five Principles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Wages rise, efficiency
improvement, food subsidy, debts repayment and rural development
are to take priorities in Egypt's budget for the 1999-2000 fiscal
year starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
At a Saturday meeting of Economic Ministerial Group under Prime
Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri, Egyptian Finance Minister Mohi Eddin
Al-Gharib said wages of government employees will be increased by
10 percent in the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in line with the privileges afforded by
the government to employees under the framework of administrative
reforms and promotion of employees, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The new budget will allocate a considerable amount of money for
raising the efficiency of governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
It will also put emphasis on the obligations on repayment of
local and foreign debts, which reach over 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian government will further provide subsidy to food,
especially bread, to keep the price stable while improving its
quality.
</P>
<P>
With regard to investment in infrastructures, including roads,
electricity and sanitary drainage, priority is given to the rural
areas, particularly in southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gharib said the expenditure of the new budget amounts to 102
billion Egyptian pounds (30 billion dollars) in the new fiscal
year, compared with 90 billion pounds (26.47 billion dollars) for
last fiscal year.
</P>

The budget should be approved by Egypt's People's Assembly
(Parliament) before the end of May.

<HEADLINE> Presidents of Uganda, Zambia Hold Talks on DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and Zambian President Frederick Chiluba held private
talks on the current situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) here Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Ugandan President's Office said that
the two leaders had a useful exchange of views on regional issues,
especially on the latest developments in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Their talks centered on the current regional peace initiative
for finding a peaceful solution to the seven-month-long conflict
in that country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, accompanied by Zambian Minister of Presidential
Affairs Eric Silwamba, arrived here Saturday morning for a two-day
official visit to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president is the chairman of a regional peace
initiative aimed at bringing an end to the war in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is widely regarded as one of the key players in the DRC
crisis. Together with Rwanda it has been accused of backing the
Tutsi-led rebels fighting to oust President Laurent Kabila, a
charge Kampala has denied.
</P>
<P>
The continued fighting between the rebels and allied forces of
the DRC government troops and troops from Angola, Zimbabwe,
Namibia and Chad poses a big threat to regional and even
continental peace.
