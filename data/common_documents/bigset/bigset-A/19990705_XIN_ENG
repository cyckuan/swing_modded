<HEADLINE> Iran condemns U.S. Stance over Arrested Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Sunday condemns the stance taken by
U.S. officials over the arrest of 13 Iranian Jews on espionage
charges.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the recent remark made by the U.S. State
Department spokesman James Foley on the issue was "unfounded
and baseless," the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Condemning Foley's remark as "vain statement," he said that
the stance represents blatant intervention in Iran's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"No country has the right to interfere in Iran's internal
affairs and such irresponsible and questionable statements are
raised on the basis of special political motives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foley on Friday rejected Iran's charges against the 13
Iranian Jews arrested for spying for the U.S. and Israel and
stated that the U.S. would make efforts to seek the release
of the Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israel denied any links between their
intelligence services with the Iranian Jews soon after Iran
confirmed the arrest last month.
</P>
<P>
"Foley's statement looks as if he is fully aware of the
contents of the files of the accused, and such an attitude is not
only astounding but it only raises a serious question" the
Iranian spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the circumstances when no court hearing
has been held for the accused, predictions on type of the
punishments on the accused are meant for exerting political
pressure to bring about political gain.
</P>
<P>
"Detection, arrest and trial of those accused of espionage
charges is an internal issue," Asefi said, "it is but natural for
any and all countries to be hyper sensitive towards such an
issue."
</P>
<P>
"The whole affair is a legal issue being domestic and
universal in nature, which also applies to the United States
of America without an exception to the rule," he said.

<HEADLINE> Major Progress Made in DRC Peace Talks: Chiluba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said Sunday that "tremendous progress" has been made in the peace
talks for ending the conflict in Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
He said he saw the hour coming when a deal will be finally
clinched.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said this at Lusaka international airport when he bade
farewell to Botswana President Festus Mogae who was in the country
on a three-day official visit during which he officially opened
this year's Zambia Trade Fair in Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the team working on the cease-fire agreement was
not revealing anything to the press because it would like to keep
everybody guessing with how far the talks have gone.
</P>
<P>
"I can guarantee you that the discussions are moving well as
tremendous progress has been made so far," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sources close to the peace talks said that key
players in the conflict would meet the Zambian leader soon, who is
the mediator for the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The sources explained that the key players are just working out
a calender on how the cease-fire agreement would be implemented
once signed.
</P>
<P>
They also disclosed that ministers of defence, home and foreign
affairs will meet soon after Chiluba briefed to set a date for the
heads of state summit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which expected to take place in Lusaka is also
aimed at adopting the final cease-fire document by the ministers.
</P>
<P>
The ministers in the region have been in Lusaka for over a week
to try hard and pave way for the signing of a cease-fire to end
the 11-month conflict in the vast African country.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the cease-fire agreement which was initially
scheduled for June 26 has been delayed due to a number of
differences.

<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- France plans to resume the flights of
Air France to Algeria, which was suspended in December 1994 after
a terrorist attack on an Airbus passenger plane of the air company
at the Algiers airport.
</P>
<P>
French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said in an
interview with the French daily Parisien published on Sunday that
France and Algeria should re-establish normal relations in air
flights as well as other transportation fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that France will soon send a technical delegation to
Algiers to make sure that conditions are ready for the resumption
of Air France flights.
</P>
<P>
All European air companies have suspended air flights to
Algeria since 1994 in fear of terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
France and Algeria have expressed their wish to improve
relations after Algeria's new president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika came
to power on April 15.
</P>
<P>
Algeria has called on France to resume the flight of Air France
because the Algerian airline cannot provide its passengers with
enough flights to France.

<HEADLINE> EC Urges Zimbabwe To Launch Anti-AIDS Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) has
urged Zimbabwe, with the highest AIDS cases in the world, to
initiate a national campaign against this fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
It said in a report released in Harare on Sunday that Zimbabwe
had one of the worst Hiv epidemics in the world with as many as 25
percent of adults or 12 percent of the population infected.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe with a population of about 12.5 million people is
expected to have its annual population growth rate decline from
2.5 percent to about 0. 7 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to the report business was currently not only losing
skilled labor but also hearing the substantial costs in health
care complications resulting from the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
It said chronic diseases emanating from HIV/AIDS was pushing
the poor to the wall.
</P>
<P>
"They sell their meagre possession for ineffective and costly
treatment on top of extended families responsibilities as
relatives die leaving behind helpless orphans now around 500,000
and expected to reach 900,000 by 2005," the reported said.
</P>
<P>
The report said devaluation of the local currency worsened an
already precarious situation with drug and equipment import costs
having doubled.
</P>
<P>
"The Blood Transfusion Service has contacted us indicating it
can no longer afford to import HIV testing kits or even blood
bags," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report criticised the government for giving little
attention to the disaster, leaving the burden to donors.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare to focus on a
number of known interventions to reduce incidence of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
These included treatment of sexually transmitted diseases known
to reduce transmission of HIV by up to 30 percent, social
marketing of condoms, ensuring safe blood transfusion, voluntary
HIV testing and management of complications of Aids in the health
system and in the community.
</P>
<P>
The EC is at present working with the Ministry and other
organizations towards strengthening district health services and
decentralization.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to secure long term supplies of district hospital
bed occupancy and plans to secure long term supplies of
reproductive health drugs, tuberculosis drugs and HIV testing
kits.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Predicts Partial Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's main anti-Israeli Muslim
group Hezbollah, or Party of God, Sunday predicted that Israel
will soon withdraw its troops from parts of the occupied border
zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Naim Qassem, Hezbollah's second-in-command, said at a
mass rally in Beirut's southern suburbs that Israel will conduct
a pullback from parts of the border zone like the previous one by
its proxy South Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
He said Israel can no longer hide behind SLA, which has
collapsed and become an additional burden on the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, the SLA was forced to leave the biggest
Christian town of Jezzine in south Lebanon it has held for 14
years under the pressure of Hezbollah's intensified bombing
attacks around the area, which lies just north of the occupied
zone.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong militia was armed and trained by Israel to
help it patrol the border zone which Israel occupied in 1985
with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli troops and SLA out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The militia's commander Antoine Lahd was reported to have made
a decision to quit his post and is waiting for the reply from
Israeli authorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Nato troops in Albania (AFOR) has
changed its role in Albania from the military aspect to the
"humanitarian mission", a high ranking Nato officer said in
northern Albania on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The main task of AFOR's humanitarian mission is to maintain the
transportation corridor from the Albanian port of Durres to Kosovo
and help Kosovars resettled in their houses, General John Reith
said at Mjeda, southeast of Shkoder.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the military camps in Albania, Reith said that the
camps can be used as training centers for Nato troops in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,000 to 8,000 Nato soldiers in Albania can come to be
trained together with Albanian soldiers in these camps, the
commander of AFOR was quoted as saying by the Albanian Telegraphic
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Nato troops will continue to stay in Albania for a long time,
till its Humanitarian mission ends, Reith added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the repatriation of Kosovars could be completed in
September if the work is carried out at current pace.
</P>

<P>
BEIRUT, July 4 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was wounded
Sunday in Lebanese guerrillas' attack in south Lebanon, the Voice
of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted security sources as saying that the soldier
was wounded when his convoy was hit by Lebanese guerrillas' heavy
weapons in the western sector of the Israeli occupied border zone
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Moslim Amal movement headed by House Speaker Nabih
Berri claimed responsibility for the attack and said its fighters
hit an Israeli intelligence vehicle, causing human casulties.
</P>
<P>
The attack raised the number of Israeli soldiers wounded in
south Lebanon to 35 since the start of this year. Ten Israeli
soldiers were killed during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in 1985 in south
Lebanon with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been spearheading a
guerrilla war to oust the Israeli occupation troops out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Amal and other groups' fighters also often carry out attacks
against Israelis in the border zone.

CAIRO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic
arrived here on Sunday for a three-day visit, during which he is

President Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon arrival at Cairo International
Airport, Granic said he will discuss with Egyptian officials
regional issues and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Granic is scheduled to hold talks with his Egyptian counterpart
Amr Moussa on ways of bolstering bilateral ties in various fields
and opening new vistas for cooperation, Croatian Ambassador in
Cairo Drago Seameuk told Egypt's Middle East News Agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also dwell on regional and international issues
of mutual interest with emphasis on the latest developments in the
Middle East, the Balkans and Africa, Seameuk said.
</P>
<P>
Granic, accompanied by 14 businessmen, is to hold talks with
Egyptian trade minister and state minister for international

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Minister Confirms Progress of DRC Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven
Mahachi said on Sunday African ministers meeting in Zambia to find
a lasting solution to the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) have adopted the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi told the Zimbabwe News Agency from Zambia that the
ministers from the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
allied forces, Rwanda and Uganda among others who had been meeting
since June 26 were now working on the time table to implement the
accord.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy that we are making progress as major
dis-agreements have been ironed out. We have agreed on principles
and methodologies and what is left is when it becomes effective,"
Mahachi said.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said the major players in the Congo war saw it fit to
have an international peace keeping force either from the United
Nations or the Organization of African Unity to enforce any truce
in the third largest country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This matter cannot be handled by any interest group as it
involves a lot of politics and fairness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, accused of aiding the Congolese rebels alongside
Uganda, had wanted Zimbabwe to take responsibility of the Hutu
militia in the Congo and disarm them.
</P>
<P>
While the rebels are backed by Rwanda and Uganda, DRC President
Laurent Kabila is enjoying military support from Zimbabwe, Angola,
Namibia and Chad.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said it was time that Rwanda and Uganda gave the
Congolese an opportunity to decide on the sovereignty of their
state and their future.
</P>
<P>
The 11-month-old war which has sucked in the six armies has
already displaced some 500,000 people inside the Congo and caused
up to 200,000 more to flee to neighboring states, according to
U.N. estimates.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord would aim at re-establishing Kinshasa's
control over the whole of the central African country and merge
three separate rebel forces with the government army, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported.

JOHANNESBURG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The African National Congress
Youth League has called on the South African Youth Council to
immediately convene a National Youth Moral Convention to tackle
the scourge of a moral decay in South African society.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made on Sunday by Youth League president
Malusi Gigaba at the end of the league's extended National

The organization's political vision, overview and its future

degeneration is not to the interests of our transformation
agenda".
</P>
<P>
The committee also adopted a youth development framework for
the next five years, based on a number of issues, including
prioritizing the completion of a guiding white paper and the
National Youth Service Act.

The youth brigade program agreed upon by the presidential Job
Summit should also be implemented, while youth participation in

<HEADLINE> Botswana Disappointed of Congo (K) Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Botswana President Festus Mogae said
he was disappointed that the on-going peace talks to end the
11-month conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have
not been concluded with the signing of a peace deal to date.
</P>
<P>
"I was made to believe that the tacks were coming to a close
but I'm disappointed that it has not happened," the president told
a press briefing in Lusaka Sunday shortly before he concluded his
three-day visit to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said he was told that an agreement had been reached in
principle to stop the fighting in the DRC, but up to Saturday no
final agreement had been reached.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the most stumbling issue to the talks has been
the absorbing of the rebels into the main army and the question of
a cease-fire after it is signed.
</P>
<P>
He added that there was no alternative to the cease-fire and
stopping the war as the region can not afford the war to continue.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue to negotiate and bring the current
hostilities between the warring parties to an end," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president could not confirm whether his
government will send a peace-keeping force to the DRC once a
cease-fire has been reached.
</P>
<P>
He said though his country has had experience in the cease-fire
 operation, he could not confirm whether it will be possible for
his small army to send soldiers to the DRC as part of
peace-keeping mission.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between Botswana and Zambia, the president
said there is need to increase trade between the two countries and
for this reason that his country has decided to build a bridge
across the Zambezi River at Kazungula to link the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the bridge will make it easier for the two countries to
export and import goods from each other.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Committee Blocks Contracts: Iraqi Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 395 contracts Iraq
signed under the fifth phase of the oil-for-food program are still
on hold by the U.N. Sanctions Committee, the Iraqi Trade Ministry
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that the contracts valued at
562 million dollars cover oil spare parts, electrical equipment,
medicine and food, medical appliances, requirements for
agriculture, irrigation and education sectors, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The fifth phase of the oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq
to export limited amount of oil in every six months to buy food
and medicine for its 22 million people, expired on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Iraq frequently complains that the U.S. and British
representatives with the Sanctions Committee deliberately block
Iraq's contracts despite the availability of funds from its oil
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
All Iraq's contracts for oil, food and other humanitarian
supplies must get the approval of the Sanctions Committee first
before shipment can be made.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long complained that the humanitarian program has
done little to alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people under
stringent U.N. sanctions imposed on the country following its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain adopt aggressive policy against Iraq and
endeavor to continue the genocide policy against the Iraqi people
by prolonging the sanctions immorally and inhumanely, said the
ministry statement.

The meeting was on the fringes of the ninth annual Southern

</P>
<P>
A Department of Trade and Industry official confirmed that the

<P>
He would not say whether the stalled trade pact was on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Both ministers were accompanied by business delegations.
</P>
<P>
Trade relations between the two countries has been marred by a
fallout over protracted negotiations about a trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Harare accuses Pretoria of dragging its feet over the renewal
of a 1964 trade agreement that expired in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The trade agreement would see the reduction of trade tariffs
which would allow Zimbabwean exports into the South African
market.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is Zimbabwe's largest trade partner, with the
balance of trade radically skewed in Pretoria's favor.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent retaliation last year in November, Zimbabwe
introduced import duties up up to 100 percent, resulting in a vast
decline in the the amount of goods entering Zimbabwe from South
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Wins Wimbledon, Makes History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Pete Sampras of
the United States claimed his rightful place in tennis history
with a sixth Wimbledon title after a straight sets win over Andre
Agassi on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old American defeated his compatriot and world
number one Agassi 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 on Center Court for his sixth win
at the All England Club in seven years.
</P>
<P>
It means Sampras is the most successful player of the modern
era and second only to William Renshaw, who won seven titles
between 1881 and 1889. And the surprisingly straightforward
victory also sees him equal Roy Emerson's record of 12 career
Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
"It feels great," said Sampras. "I love it out there on Center
Court. I don't know why but this tournament brings out the best in
me. The atmosphere is phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question this is our biggest tournament and to
beat Andre on the Fourth of July is pretty sweet," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is a weird feeling after you win... it all hits you at once
but it's a great feeling. I have got a lot of respect for Andre, I
had to be at my best to beat him and although it was straight sets
it certainly wasn't easy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who lost his top spot in the world rankings to Agassi
despite his victory, was always on top after saving three break
points in the sixth game before breaking Agassi in the next game
and then taking the opening set 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, attempting to become the first player since Bjorn Borg
in 1980 to win the French Open and Wimbledon crowns in the same
year,battled as hard as ever but found himself matched by Sampras
from the back of the court as well as the net.
</P>
<P>
Sampras held his own serve with comfort and in typical style a
thumping serve gave him the second set 6-4 and left Agassi with a
mountain to climb. The crowd was willing Agassi to get back into
the match but whenever he sensed a chance on the Sampras serve, he
found another big serve whistling past him.
</P>
<P>
He saved two break points midway through the set to keep the
match alive but it was only delaying the inevitable and the key
moment in the third set came as Agassi served at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old saved one break point before hitting a
straightforward backhand into the net to gift his opponent the
crucial break. Sampras now only had to serve out for an historic
sixth title - and third successive - and fittingly did it in style
with an ace at 110mph on second serve on match point.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika has decided to pardon some terrorism-related prisoners
as a step for national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
A presidential statement said Bouteflika used his power to show
his personal determination to achieve the national reconciliation,
the Algerian News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty will benefit thousands of convicts who have been
proven guilty in the terrorism phenomenon, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
But those who have been proven guilty of murder, rape or
possession of explosives for intimidating people at public places
will be excluded from the pardon.
</P>
<P>
The president paid homage to the souls of the victims of
terrorism and expressed deep condolence to their families.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he vowed to protect the rights of these families and
respect the results of the proposed referendum on national
reconciliation among the Algerian people.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika was elected president of Algeria on April 15.
</P>
<P>
In his first address to the nation since taking office,
Bouteflika declared national reconciliation and arousing the
national awareness as his top priorities.
</P>
<P>
In response to Bouteflika's initiative, head of the Islamic
Salvation Army (ISA) Medani Mezeraq declared a total cease fire on
June 6 and urged his followers to comply with his call.
</P>
<P>
The ISA is the armed wing of the Islamic Salvation Front banned
by the Algerian authorities in 1992. The ISA and other armed
militias have since launched terrorist acts that killed thousands
of people.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Pardons Thousands of Islamists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika announced on Sunday an amnesty measure to pardon
thousands of Islamists imprisoned for terrorist and subversive
activities against the government, according to reports from
Algiers.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty measure fell on the eve of the 37th anniversary of
independence of Algeria on July 5.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Algerian Parliament is beginning to debate a
draft law presented by the government on seeking ``civil concord''
in the country, which was tortured by seven years of violence.
</P>
<P>
The civil concord law would decide the fate of the Islamic
guerrillas engaged in the war with government forces since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Algerians are also waiting for unspecified ``extra measures''
aimed at national reconciliation, as was announced by President
Bouteflika last week.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Sunday's amnesty measure, the Islamists to
be released do not include those convicted of killing, rape and
staging bomb attack in public places.
</P>
<P>
Those who committed ``soft'' crimes such as information
collection and logistical support, will be pardoned.
</P>
<P>
Algerian press estimated that from 5,000 to 12,000 people will
benefit from Sunday's amnesty.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian newspapers also said that President Bouteflika
could lift the state of emergency imposed in 1992 by the
military-backed government, and release the number one of the
outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), Abassi Madani, who is
under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
An inquiry could also be launched by the government into the
whereabouts of ``disappeared'' people in the past seven years,
said some Algerian press reports.
</P>
<P>
These measures could be announced Monday evening by Bouteflika
in an address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
But the measure is not expected to cover the number two of FIS,
Ali Belhadj, who has refused to support the recent decision by the
Islamic Salvation Army, the armed wing of FIS, to definitely give
up armed struggle against the government.
</P>
<P>
The most hardline Islamic group, the Armed Islamic Group (GIA),
has presented six conditions for accepting the government
initiative on national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The GIA conditions are not likely to be accepted by the
government because they call for the release of all Islamists from
jail.

<HEADLINE> Second Shipment of Saudi Foodstuff Reaches Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A second shipment of foodstuff
from Saudi Arabia under the U.N. food-for-oil program has arrived
in Iraq, the Iraqi Trade Ministry announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The first shipment of foodstuff from Saudi Arabia under the
oil-for-food program arrived in Iraq last month, the Iraqi News
Agency quoted an unnamed Trade Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The total contracts Iraq signed with Saudi companies under the
oil-for-food deal for the purchase of foodstuff and some oil
equipment are valued at 150 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, but since 1996 allowed it to export limited amount
of oil every six month to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people. The program is
called oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The current sixth phase of the deal, which came into force on
May 25, allows Iraq to export 5.26 billion dollars worth of oil.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-Saudi relations have remained cool since the 1991
Gulf War touched off by Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the Saudi government of allowing
U.S. and British warplanes to use its bases for patrolling a
no-fly zone over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the southern no-fly zone
in Iraq in 1992 with a claimed aim of protecting the Shiite
Muslims there from any possible attacks by Iraqi government
troops.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes taking off from
Saudi, Kuwaiti and Turkish bases have been regularly attacking
Iraqi targets.

MOSCOW -- Russia said Sunday that it was "stunned" by the
refusal of Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania to provide air corridors
to its peacekeepers flying to Kosovo under pressure from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
It said all references to improperly coordinated technical
details of locating Russian paratroopers in Kosovo are absolutely
unfounded, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting sources with
the Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Denial of air corridors by Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria
forced Russia to postpone indefinitely the departure of two
military transport aircraft for Kosovo originally scheduled for
early Sunday.

<P>
Washington and its NATO allies reportedly want to work out
details of Russia's peacekeeping role in Kosovo before Moscow
sends any new troops to augment its about 400 troops already

NEW DELHI -- After three days of fierce fighting, Indian troops
Sunday recaptured the strategic Tiger Hills, a strategic 4,877-
metre high peak overlooking the vital Sringagar-Leh national
highway in the Indian side of the line of control (LOC) in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The recapture was announced by the Defense Minister George
Fernandes in Amritsar, 447 km northwest of here, according to the
Press Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
Fernandes said that he had been informed by the Army chief V. P.
Malik about the recapture of the Tiger Hills, a key bastion and
supply camp of the so-called intruders in the Kargil region of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
On the news of recapture, Indian caretaker Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee announced Sunday that Indian troops had achieved "
tremendous success" in evicting entrenched Pakistani "intruders"
in Kargil.
</P>
<P>
At a function in the state of Haryana, Vajpayee appealed to the
nation to be united to win the conflict with neighboring Pakistan.

NEW DELHI -- Indian caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee had expressed his inability "at this stage" to undertake
a visit to the United States, a spokesman of the External Affairs
Ministry disclosed here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Saturday invited Vajpayee to
visit Washington "at an early date" for discussions apparently on
the on-going conflict between India and Pakistan in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Clinton extended the invitation during
his 10-minute telephone conversation with Vajpayee last night.
</P>
<P>
The Indian leader told Clinton that it would "not be possible
for him to accept this kind of invitation for the present" and "
not convenient at this stage," the spokesman told a daily news
briefing here.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. leader's invitation was "bilateral" in
nature and had "no relation whatsoever to Pakistan Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif's visit to Washington" which began Sunday. (India-PM-

WUHAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The water levels of the Yangtze River,
the largest in China, have surpassed warning lines, due to big
rainfalls in the area since June 15 and the year's first flood
peak that is passing through Hubei Province in central China.
</P>
<P>
This morning at 8:00, the water level at the Wuhanguan Point,
Hubei, measured 27.36 meters, 0.06 meters above the warning line,
while the measuring points in Jianli County, Hubei, and Jiujiang
City, Jiangxi Province, have already exceeded the warning lines.

Provincial leaders of Hubei have arrived in affected areas to

<HEADLINE> South Asia More Prone to Natural Disasters: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Experts warn that South Asia is
now more prone to natural disasters than ever before due to
highest population in the world, deforestation wrecking ecological
defects and global warming.
</P>
<P>
Subhash Gupta, Joint Secretary of the India Red Cross Society,
said Sunday that environmental changes are now leading to
increasing instances of cyclones, earthquakes, floods and famines
in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
In India alone, the annual loss due to cyclone damage along its
vast coastline is 2 billion rupees (46.5 million U.S. dollars) and
at times it could even exceeds 4 billion rupees (93 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Gupta indicated that environmental changes also raise the risks
of resource wars as nations and communities fight for rights to
key resources such as water.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, even though India and Pakistan have an
international treaty over division of the waters of the River
Indus and its tributaries, it could come under pressure if the
Indus loses 40 percent of its flow as predicted by climatologists.

<HEADLINE> Report: NATO Delegation in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A NATO delegation arrived in Moscow
on Sunday afternoon to discuss interaction with Russia in
peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda would be the denial by Hungary, Romania and
Bulgaria of an air corridor for Russian planes with peacekeeping
troops to Kosovo, Interfax said, quoting Western diplomatic
sources in the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman has neither confirmed nor
denied the reported arrival of a NATO mission, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The three East European countries decided to block Kosovo-bound
Russian aircraft as a result of pressure from the United States,
which says details of Russian's peacekeeping role in the Yugoslav
province must be clarified before more Russian troops fly to
Kosovo, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow said Sunday that it was "stunned" by the refusal to
grant an air corridor, adding that all references to improperly
coordinated technical details of locating Russian paratroopers in
Kosovo are absolutely unfounded, the Interfax news agency
reported, quoting sources with the Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Denial of air corridors by Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria forced
Russia to postpone indefinitely the departure of two military
transport aircraft for Kosovo originally scheduled for early
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Western media reports said that Russian military negotiators
last week sought to alter an agreement reached earlier in Helsinki
by having their troops in Kosovo report only to Russian officers,
rather than be under the formal command of NATO. Russia also
wants to station forces in the Italian, French, American and
German sectors of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, a representative with the Russian Defense Ministry
said, "All details of the location of Russian peacekeepers in
Kosovo were documented during the talks held by the defense and
foreign ministers in Helsinki."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, these details were updated during the talks held
in Brussels this week by Deputy Head of the Defense Ministry's
Department for International Military Cooperation Valentin
Kuznetsov.
</P>
<P>
Mistrust has been mounting between Moscow and the U.S.-led NATO
following Russia's surprise deployment of 200 troops to Pristina
airport last month and an usual military exercise about two weeks
ago in which American F-15 jets intercepted Russian
fighter-bombers near Iceland.
</P>
<P>
The two Il-76 planes were to have taken off from the Severny
airport near the city of Ivanovo early Sunday. One plane was to
carry two heavy-duty trucks, technological equipment and a
maintenance team. The other was to take over 100 paratroopers and
a group of reporters to cover the peacekeeping mission in the
Balkans, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Committee Set Up in UAE to Deal With Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
has set up a committee to deal with border-related issues with
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The Permanent Border Committee, as it is named, will carry out
contacts and negotiations related to the country's land and marine
borders with neighboring countries and to perform other duties
entrusted to it by the president.
</P>
<P>
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan issued a decree on
June 29 to appoint Dubai Crown Prince and UAE Defense Minister
General Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum chairman of the
committee, the official WAM news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has a border dispute with its Gulf neighbor Iran over
the islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs, which are
located near strategic shipping lanes in the Gulf. Iran took over
the three islands from Britain in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The decree stipulated that the committee should be joined by
the crown prince of the emirate when its border issues are
discussed.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is a federation of seven emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai,
Sharjah, Ras al-Khaimah, Fujairah, Umm al-Qaiwain and Ajman.
</P>
<P>
On June 29, the president issued another decree to transfer the
duties of the country's land-based border guards to the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, which group Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain
and the UAE, issued a joint statement in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,
after a one-day meeting, supporting the UAE's sovereignty over the
three disputed islands with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran rejected the statement as "unacceptable" and reiterated
that the islands were part of Iranian territories.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran reiterated on Sunday that the
four Iranian diplomats missing in northern Beirut in 1982 had
been kidnaped by Israel and Tel Aviv should release them without
any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement on the eve of the 17th anniversary of
the missing, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said that Israel
should directly bear the responsibility for the missing of the
Iranians with the consideration of evidences.
</P>
<P>
Various evidences indicated that the missing Iranian diplomats
are still alive and have been moved to Israel, the Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
It called on the Lebanese government to use all possibilities
to probe into the case and seek the release of the Iranian
diplomats and also urged international human rights groups to help
clarify the fate of the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
The ministry vowed that it would spare no efforts to find out
the Iranian diplomats under any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Israel entered a new round of tension following the
arrest of 13 Iranian Jews on charge of spying for Israel and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and the U.S. have rejected the Iranian claims and
called on Tehran to release the Iranians immediately.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran has stated that the Iranian Jews would be tried
according to Iranian laws and they might be sentenced to death for
spying against the country's security.

NAIROBI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-nine people were killed and
dozens of others seriously injured in three separate accidents
over the weekend in Kenya.

<P>
Eyewitnesses said that vehicles involved were badly destroyed
and local residents used axes to hack away metal of the mangled
vehicles to rescue the victims.
</P>
<P>
Local police base commander G. Maina said that the toll might

<HEADLINE> Maronite Cypriot Jailed for Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A Maronite Cypriot was sentenced
for four years in prison Monday by Cypriot court on charge of
spying for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The three-judge assize court meeting in Nicosia said
Avgoustinos Skoullou was found guilty of collecting information
about Cyprus' National Guard for Turkey, the Cyprus News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
During the period between 1996 and January 1999, when he
visited the Turkish Cypriots-controlled northern part of Cyprus,
Skoullou passed on information to an officer of the Turkish army,
who is also member of the Turkish intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Skoullou, 53, at last was caught red-handed when he was
intending to give a note about Cypriot political situation to the
Turkish military.
</P>
<P>
The convicted spy was seen on four occasions loitering near
National Guard camps and collecting information.
</P>
<P>
Skoullou is from the Maronite village of Kormakitis in the
Turkish Cypriot area of the northern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
Skoullou's conviction came several weeks after another
Maronite, George Iosifides, was sentenced to six years
imprisonment on spying charges.
</P>
<P>
"The seriousness of offenses of this nature, especially at
a time when the dangers to the very existence of our country
are an obvious reality, need hardly be stressed," judge Georgios
Arestis said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,000 Roman Catholic Maronites live in Cyprus, but only
some 160 remain in the Turkish Cypriots-controlled northern
area.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Launches Technopreneur Home Office Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore released on Monday
details of a scheme under which start-up technology entrepreneurs
can set up offices at their homes.
</P>
<P>
The Housing and Development Board (HDB) and the National
Science and Technology Board (NSTB) said in a press release that
from Monday technopreneurs may apply for approval to use their own
residential homes as home offices under the Technopreneur Home
Office Scheme.
</P>
<P>
The measure, as part of a comprehensive package to create a
conducive environment for technopreneurial development, is aimed
at easing entry and lowering the cost of starting up business in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
It will allow people to focus on getting their business ideas
to the market rather than having to worry about a place to start,
said Low Kiam Cheow, chairman of the Technopreneur Home Office
Task Force.
</P>
<P>
"The prime objective is to make sure that in terms of the entry
barrier we try to make it as low as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, people living in HDB apartments and private
residential property will be able to use their residential
addresses for the purpose of registering their unlisted companies.
</P>
<P>
To qualify, the principal activity of the start-up must be
information and communication technology-focused and the business
should be in sectors which NSTB has identified as high-growth,
export-oriented and intellectual property-based.
</P>
<P>
The same premise may be used as the registered address for more
than one business, if the businesses are owned by the same
eligible person. However, the primary purpose of the premises must
remain residential.
</P>
<P>
These home offices could be the equivalent home garages in the
United States that have spawned many hi-tech enterprises, the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, a resource-poor island country, has often referred
to the U.S. Silicon Valley's legendary story as its model to
nurture the information technology (IT) industry by supporting
budding hi-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
About 100 new IT companies start businesses in Singapore every
year and the city state aims to bring that figure to 1,000 in 10
years.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 14 Wounded in Suicide Bombing in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and 14 others
wounded in a suicide bombing in southern Turkey on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The woman suicide bomber killed herself in the front of Seyhan
Town Gendarme Coomandership in Adana province at 16:20 local time
(1320 GMT), the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
One police director, seven policemen, two technicians and four
civilians were wounded in the bombing, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
It added that an investigation into the bombing is underway.
</P>
<P>
Last October, one woman terrorist made a suicide bombing in
Adana, leaving four people dead, including herself, and 12 others
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday night, one person was killed and 25 others injured
when a time bomb exploded in a dustbin in a picnic place at
Avcilar district of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul Governor Erol Cakir accused rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) of being responsible for the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were suspected of retaliation acts launched by PKK
rebels because their leader Abdullah Ocalan was sentenced to death
last Tuesday on charges of treason and separatism.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan-led PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Conflicts
between the Turkish security forces and the PKK militants have
claimed over 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkish special agents in Kenya in
mid-February and has ever since been detained on Imrali Island in
Marmara Sea near western Turkey's province of Bursa where he was
tried on charges of treasons and separatism.

<HEADLINE> French Oil Giants Likely to Merge As Total Makes Takeover Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- France's two oil giants, Total-Fina
and Elf-Aquitaine, are likely to merge after Total-Fina launched
an unfriendly takeover bid against Elf on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Elf immediately rejected the takeover bid by its brother-rival
as "hostile," but the stock market welcomed the bid by Total-Fina
by pushing Elf's share value up by 17 percent to 172 euros (175 U.
S. dollars) per share by noon on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Officer of Total-Fina, Thierry Desmarest,
expressed his optimism about an eventual merger with Elf and he
expected the French government with the veto right over the said
merger not to block the move.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the initiative by Total-Fina will surely win
support from the French government and the European Union
Commission.
</P>
<P>
A merger between the two groups will also have to win support
from the Commission of Operations of Stock Exchange in France, and
New York-based European and U.S. authorities in charge of anti-
trust affairs in free market competition.
</P>
<P>
Total-Fina offers to exchange every three shares of Elf with
four of its own shares, and promises to offer Elf's stock holders
a 15 percent premium.
</P>
<P>
The total shares of Elf in the stock markets were estimated at
42 billion euros (42.8 billion U.S. dollars) as stock markets
closed last Friday.
</P>
<P>
If Total-Fina and Elf merges, it will become the world's fourth
largest oil group after the oil mega-powers of Exxon Mobil, BP-
Amoco-Arco and Shell.
</P>
<P>
A new Total-Fina-Elf group would produce 2 million barrels of
oil each day, behind 4.2 million barrels by Exxon-Mobil, 4 million
barrels by BP-Amoco-Arco, and 3.7 million barrels by Shell.
</P>
<P>
The Total-Fina bid was made after rumors were spread recently
that Elf could be seeking an alliance with Shell.
</P>
<P>
Total-Fina, which has just completed its merger with Belgian
Petrofina, employs 71,600 people, while Elf employs 85,000.
</P>
<P>
International oil analysts said that a merger between the two
French oil giants will be a good inter-French solution in the face
of increasingly fierce competition in world oil market.
</P>
<P>
The two groups will benefit from their common French culture
and "typically French" strategies -- a strong will of independence,
solid establishment in Western Africa, and strong influence from
the French government in their choices of investment.
</P>
<P>
Both Total-Fina and Elf have also built strong links with
Middle East countries such as Iran, especially in upstream fields
of exploration and production.

DHAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Two buses carrying 70 passengers left
here Monday for Calcutta, capital of the West Bengal state of
India, marking the formal start of the commercial operation of bus
service between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight officials led by Kader Mahmudul Hasan, joint
secretary of the Communication Ministry, and 42 ordinary
passengers were traveling by the inaugural buses.
</P>
<P>
The full operation is expected to begin from Friday after the
buses come back on Wednesday, as the opposition parties have

The maiden commercial bus trip, which was initially scheduled
for June 29, had been deferred three times for various reasons.

Under a two-year agreement signed here between the two South
Asian neighboring countries last month, initially two buses from
Dhaka and two from Calcutta will operate on the route every other
day except Sundays and the arrangement will continue for three
months before it is reviewed.

<HEADLINE> World Price Drop to Hit Hard Thai Sugar Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report said the prospects of Thailand's sugar export this
year were quite worrisome as the shipments in the first four
months just totaled 1.06 million tons worth 7.65 billion baht
(206.8 million U.S. dollars), down 9.2 percent and 46.7 percent
respectively from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Although the volume of Thailand's sugar export fell slightly,
the value plummeted significantly. It was because the world sugar
prices this year adjusted downward to an average of 6.64 cents a
pound, the lowest level in the past 12 years, compared with an
average of 12 cents a pound during 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The world sugar price slump mainly resulted from the reduced
world consumption and the increased production in some sugar
producing countries, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The center said the price slump is expected to hit hard the
Thai sugar industry this year because its 60 percent revenue will
have to be acquired from sugar export.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Reiterates Stance on Reuniting Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' National Council, the top
advisory body on the handling of the Cyprus issue to President
Glafcos Clerides, Monday reiterated its firm position not to allow
any deviation from the ultimate goal of reuniting Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The National Council Monday held a three-hour meeting to
review the recent developments in efforts to resume peace talks
on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Nicos Anastasiades, leader of the ruling Democratic Rally
party, said after the meeting that there was a serious discussion
on the basis of the recent developments.
</P>
<P>
He justified concerns as well as the need to see the political
leadership act in concert to avert any unpleasant developments
others may be pushing for.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the left AKEL party Demetris Christofias
said the Cyprus issue is "undergoing a very crucial phase."
</P>
<P>
He warned that "a deviation from the U.N. resolutions is being
planned by the U.N. themselves."
</P>
<P>
Spyros Kyprianou, leader of the Democratic Party, said there
are critical times ahead given that certain developments indicate
that a confederal solution seems to be on the cards.
</P>
<P>
Yiannakis Omirou, first vice-president of the socialist EDEK
party, warned of the risk to see the Cyprus issue being discussed
on a different basis.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government and political leadership must
work together to make sure there is no diversion from the
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The National Council will meet again on July 16 for further
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on June 29 passed two resolutions,
which called on the two sides to hold unconditional talks by
putting all issues on the table.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side insists that negotiations on Cyprus
should be carried out on a state-to-state basis in a bid to obtain
some kind of international recognition for the "Turkish Republic

VIENNA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The average price of OPEC's basket
of seven crudes rose to 16.38 U.S. dollars per barrel last week,
from 15.75 dollars the week before, the Vienna-based Secretariat
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the notable price rise to OPEC members'
strict implementation of an agreement on cutting oil output, which
was reached in Vienna in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, declining oil storage in major oil consumption
countries such as the United States, and the recovery of Asian
economies, also contributed to the OPEC oil price rise, analysts

<HEADLINE> U.S. Maintains Trade Privilege for 5 Thai Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States has agreed to
maintain its trade privileges under the Generalized System of
Preference (GSP) for five Thai products as requested by the Thai
government, a senior Thai Commerce Ministry official said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pisanu Lienmanhasarn, deputy director-general of the Department
of Foreign Trade, said the five products include papaya, flour,
boiled shells in pressed-air containers, lychees and longans, the
Thai News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision was a result of the 1998 review by the U.S.
government on the GSP status of foreign products imported into the
country, which was recently announced and sent to the Thai
Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government earlier asked Washington to continue to
grant GSP to the five Thai exports, quoting Bangkok's worst
economic crisis in decades as the reason.
</P>
<P>
However, pending the official renewal of the GSP program, which
expired on June 30, exports of the five Thai food products to the
United States would be temporarily taxed at regular rates, ranging
from 2.2 percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Pisanu told Thai exporters that they could ask for tax refunds,
retro-effective from the date that the GSP expired, after
Washington announces its official renewal of the GSP program.

MOSCOW -- Russia said Monday that it has reached a deal with
NATO on the transfer and deployment of its peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically, (the troops) can leave at any moment," a
Russian Defense Ministry official was quoted as saying after the
end of talks here with a NATO delegation.
</P>
<P>
During two days of talks, the two sides reached the conclusion
that there are no obstacles to the stationing of a Russian
peacekeeping contingent in Kosovo, the Interfax news agency
reported, quoting Russian Defense Ministry sources.
</P>

On Sunday, denial of air corridors by Hungary, Romania and
Bulgaria, under pressure from the United States, forced Russia to
postpone indefinitely the departure of two military transport
aircraft for Kosovo originally scheduled for early Sunday.
</P>

The United States and its NATO allies reportedly want to work
out details of Russia's peacekeeping role in Kosovo before Moscow
sends any new troops to augment its about 400 troops already

<HEADLINE> Withdrawal of Pakistani Troops First: India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- India Monday said that only after
Pakistan withdraws its troops from its side of the Line of Control
(LOC) in Kashmir, other steps could be initiated.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Pakistan will heed this call immediately. We will be
watching developments on the ground," an official spokesman said
in a statement released here.
</P>
<P>
He said India has seen the U.S.-Pakistan joint statement issued
in Washington Sunday, in which Pakistan reportedly agreed to take
"concrete steps" for restoring the LOC as per the Simla Agreement
signed with India.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif held three hours of talks in Washington and issued a joint
statement Sunday. U.S. officials told reporters that Pakistan
would withdraw from Indian soil in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement also quoted Clinton as saying he would take
personal interest in "encouraging an expeditious resumption and
intensification" of dialogue between India and Pakistan to resolve
all bilateral issues once the sanctity of the LOC was fully
restored.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had also reportedly invited Indian caretaker Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to visit Washington for talks, but
the the invitation was rejected. India is strongly against a
third party being involved in the Indo-Pakistan dispute over the
Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
"Our U.S. interlocutors have informed us that 'concrete steps'
referred to in the statement means withdrawal by Pakistan of their
forces from our side of the LOC in the Kargil sector. We have also
noted the sequencing of steps agreed to in the statement, that
only after withdrawal is completed will other contemplated steps
be initiated," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"One word about the Lahore process, it is direct and bilateral.
In this process, there is no place whatsoever for any third-party
involvement. The same is true for any other aspect of the
India-Pakistan relations," the statement further said.

transportation, while the centerpiece of the games, the San Moix
Stadium, has yet to be officially sanctioned for athletics
competition.
</P>
<P>
Athletes are competing in 12 sports through July 13 on the

temperatures reaching into the 30s Celsius (90s F) daily. Many
athletes are housed in hotels without air conditioning.

<HEADLINE> China to Set up Tri-Party System for Tackling Labor Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China is to establish a tri-party
mechanism, formed of representatives from the government,
enterprises and trade unions, to deal with important labor issues
in a coordinated way.
</P>
<P>
China's top union leader Wei Jianxing, president of the All-
China Federation of Trade Unions, announced this today at a forum
to mark the fifth anniversary of the introduction of the country's
Labor Law. He called for the Labor Law to be implemented properly
and fully in order to safeguard the working and political rights
and economic interests of laborers.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that the Labor Law was the first of its kind in China
aimed at protecting the legal rights of laborers and was also a
basic law for the overall regulation of the labour market.
</P>
<P>
He is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Political Bureau, and spoke
highly of the great achievements made by the CPC and government
departments at all levels on carrying out the law over the past
five years. However, he noted that publicizing the law is still
laggardly and incidents involving violations of laborers' rights
occurred occasionally in some localities.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing development of a socialist market economy, featured
with the readjustment and improvement of ownership, the
diversification of forms of public ownership, and the rapid
development of a non-public sector have brought about a far-
reaching impact on the labor force, which has created new
opportunities as well as new problems and call for higher demands
in the implementation of the law, according to the top union
leader.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that to further implement the Labor Law depends
on consistently increasing public awareness about its importance
and making substantial efforts to strengthen the leadership over
the implementation of the law.
</P>
<P>
"To materialize, guard and develop the interests of the working
people is the fundamental starting-point of the current reform and
economic drive as well as the most important policy of the state,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that over the past five years, over 300,
000 companies across the country have signed collective contracts,
covering more than 66 million employees; while departments
concerned have handled more than 700,000 labor disputes so far.

<HEADLINE>   Palma Stages Cheapest Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Palma de Mallorca has been
staging the cheapest Universiade with the record entry of
participants, said Joan Fageda Aubert, Mayor of Palma, on Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Joan Fageda Aubert, also
president of the Universiade Foundation set up in December 1994,
said that a total of 12,000 million pesetas (80 million US dollars)
has been invested as a budget for the Games.
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect to make money from the Games as we even
foresee a 10-20 percent deficit eventually," said the mayor. "But
we will take over all the infrastructures and facilities after the
games, which was the main reason for us to bid for the Games 10
years ago."
</P>
<P>
"We're proud of staging the cheapest Universiade as Fukuoka of
Japan had an earlier low-record budget of 15,000 million pesetas (
100 million US dollars) in 1995," said Fageda.
</P>
<P>
As being the first time to be host for such an international
sports meeting, Palma sought the help from the Federation of the
International Students Unions and did send out officials to attend
the previous Games in Shiefield, Buffalo, Fukuoka and Sicily to
seek experiences.
</P>
<P>
"But we still encounter the problem of infrastructure work,
with the coordination efforts to be the toughest one concerning
the central, provisional, municipal government levels," the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
"Surely, we have some factors to improve for the Games, such as
transportation and language services as most of the volunteers can
't speak English," Fageda admitted.
</P>
<P>
However, "everything is in order, in place and is working and
even the opening ceremony is spectacular although our volunteers
have only two to three months for rehearsal," he said, adding that
the audience for the Games is reportedly as high as 800 million.
</P>
<P>
The organizers have contacted officials from four delegations
of China, the United States, Costa Rica and the Netherlands, "they
are satisfied with the services and didn't complain about all the
things concerning transportation, food and accommodation," said
Fernando Gimenez Pascual, executive president of the organizing
committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Malaysian trade
ministers met Monday to explore ways to enhance tourism
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Trade and Industry Minister George Yeo and Malaysian
Minister of Culture, Arts and Tourism Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir
agreed during the meeting to revive the Malaysia Singapore Tourism
Council.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also agreed to pool resources to better
promote tourism, a move to be examined by the council.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the two neighboring countries should increase
meetings between the National Association of Travel Agents
Singapore and its Malaysian counterpart and facilitate exchanges
between the arts councils of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed ideas of making traveling
between the two countries more convenient, including making
available a smart card for Singapore visitors and speeding up
customs clearance at the causeway connecting the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both ministers agreed that there should be more informal
meetings at various levels between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Kadir, who is on a private visit to Singapore, said that
while there will always be bilateral hiccups, Singaporeans and
Malaysians should always visit each other naturally.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Singapore and Malaysia have been bumpy as the
two neighbors squabble over a series of knotty issues such as the
renewal of agreements on Malaysia's water supply to Singapore, the
opening of Malaysia's sky to Singapore's training military
aircraft and the Malaysian immigration and customs facilities in a
Singapore railway station.

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker Defense Minister
George Fernandes has said the capturing of Tiger Hill in the
Kargil sector of Kashmir would pave the way for India's final
victory in the fighting with Pakistan along the Line of Control
(LOC).
</P>
<P>
It was a decisive victory and a turning point in the operations
which would pave the way for an early end to the operations
against the Pakistani "intruders," the Press Trust of India (PTI)
Monday quoted the minister as saying in a border area in the
Western Sector Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mop-up operations at the Tiger Hill top were in progress and
according to the latest reports received from the troops, 10
Pakistani soldiers were killed and many wounded. Fierce fighting
was going on one of the spurs emanating from the Tiger Hill top
and five Indian soldiers had been killed and five others wounded,
an Army spokesman said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reconnaissance sorties were launched Monday morning in the
Muntho Dhalo area to monitor enemy activity in the sector. In the
Drass sector, a pair of fighters carried out a search-and-destroy
mission Monday morning. The Air Force launched two airstrikes
against an enemy supply camp near Kaksar Sunday evening, an Air
Force spokesman said here Monday.

<HEADLINE> Senior Legislator Urges Improvement of Product Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The general quality of products in
China needs to be greatly improved as soon as possible, and the
law on product quality should be enforced nationwide, a senior
legislator stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (
NPC) Standing Committee, made the remarks after hearing the report
of an inspection by the NPC Standing Committee on five provinces
and municipalities on the enforcement of product-quality law.
</P>
<P>
The inspection was conducted from June 18 to 30 in Zhejiang,
Shandong, Guangdong, Henan provinces and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Tian said many painful lessons have told us that fake and
shoddy goods, especially in the electrical field, can not only
cause serious losses to people's life and property, but also
affect potential economic development.
</P>
<P>
The law on product quality should be further publicized and its
enforcement should be strengthened. "The production of fake and
shoddy products will be severely cracked down on," said Tian.
</P>
<P>
The inspection team reported that the punishment stipulated in
the law is not feasible or tough enough yet. Therefore, an
amendment of the product-quality law will be submitted to the NPC
Standing Committee for discussion.

<HEADLINE> Four Insurance Companies Punished for Malpractices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC) has punished four insurance companies for
carrying out illegal practices and irregularities.
</P>
<P>
They include two branch offices of the People's Insurance
Company of China (PICC) in Zunyi City in southwest China's Guizhou
Province and Zibo City in east China's Shandong Province, and two
branch offices of China Ping'an Insurance Company Ltd., in
Xiangtan in central China's Hunan Province and Beijing, according
to a national meeting held by the CIRC.
</P>
<P>
They were accused of chaotic management, incomplete procedures
and the use of outdated policies or financial systems in providing
insurance policies for automobiles. The company in Zunyi was
ordered to suspend business for three months; the companies in
Zibo and Xiangtan were also ordered to suspend business for three
months and the company in Beijing was criticized in a circulated
notice.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of standardizing the market is to prevent risks and
strengthen management, and the effort will help spur the sound
development of China's insurance industry," said Wu Dingfu, vice-
chairman of the commission.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says Kosovo Row With NATO Resolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Monday that it has
reached a deal with NATO on the transfer and deployment of its
peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically, (the troops) can leave at any moment," a
Russian Defense Ministry official was quoted as saying after the
end of talks here with a NATO delegation.
</P>
<P>
During two days of talks, the two sides reached the conclusion
that there are no obstacles to the stationing of a Russian
peacekeeping contingent in Kosovo, the Interfax news agency
reported, quoting Russian Defense Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, denial of air corridors by Hungary, Romania and
Bulgaria, under pressure from the United States, forced Russia to
postpone indefinitely the departure of two military transport
aircraft for Kosovo originally scheduled for early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its NATO allies reportedly want to work
out details of Russia's peacekeeping role in Kosovo before Moscow
sends any new troops to augment its about 400 troops already
stationed in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The two Il-76 planes were to have taken off from the Severny
airport near the city of Ivanovo early Sunday. One plane was to
carry two heavy-duty trucks, technological equipment and a
maintenance team. The other was to take over 100 paratroopers and
a group of reporters to cover the peacekeeping mission in the
Balkans, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Western media reports said that Russian military negotiators
last week sought to alter an agreement reached earlier in Helsinki
by having their troops in Kosovo report only to Russian officers,
rather than be under the formal command of NATO. Russia also
wants to station forces in the Italian, French, American and
German sectors of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, five ships of the Russian Black Sea
Fleet have started to take aboard 155 armored vehicles and about 1,
500 servicemen for departure to Greece, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
The hardware and troops, brought to the Black Sea's Agoi Gulf
by rail, will eventually go to Kosovo as part of deployment of
Russia's 3,600 peacekeeping contingent in the Yugoslav province.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Soothes Retired Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has assured that his administration would not hesitate to
"recycle" retired officers back into national service if it found
such officers fit and capable of carrying out desired
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
At a special dinner given in honor of retiring top army, navy,
air force and police officers at the State House in the capital
Abuja, Obasanjo Sunday advised his audience to always make
themselves available to the government any time their services
were required again.
</P>
<P>
He noted that those of them who gave loyal, honorable and
meritorious services to the country must be ready at all times for
the possibility of being recycled back into the service, the New
Nigerian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo told the retired officers that the government was
proud of the services that they had rendered to the nation,
adding: "even though you are retiring, you should regard your
retirement as only a halt and not a stop in the service of your
fatherland."
</P>
<P>
The most senior officer in the group, Lt. Gen. Rufus Kupolati,
stated in a brief response on behalf of the retiring officers,
that the invitation to dinner by the president was very soothing,
coming at a time when every comment in the mass media on the
military had been uncomplimentary.
</P>
<P>
The new civilian government has retired, on a voluntary and
compulsory basis, around 100 high ranking military officers since
its inauguration in May 29. Obasanjo has explained on different
occasions that the move is made on consideration of fairness and
improvement of the government's image.

<HEADLINE> Mainland Protests Murdering of Fishermen But Wants Normal Cooperation: Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A Taiwanese sea-captain who killed
11 Chinese mainland contract fishing laborers and caused the
deaths of four others in Mauritius waters last February must be
strictly punished by law and the incident should not affect
cooperation in terms of labor supply across the Taiwan Straits, a
senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hui, director of the Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), told Xinhua that the mainland side was
astonished and indignant at the incident and has closely followed
the matter.
</P>
<P>
A joint investigation by mainland officials has brought to
light that during the February incident, 11 mainland crew members
of the Taiwan fishing boat Chin Ching 12 were shot dead by the
captain Kung Tai-an. Four others, in extreme terror, jumped into
the sea and were drowned.
</P>
<P>
The investigation found that Kung took the "brutal actions"
because the mainland crew members refused to sign a renewal of
their three-year contracts, which were due to expire by the end of
last February.
</P>
<P>
"These criminal actions must be strictly punished by law,"
stressed Wang. "Relevant Taiwanese companies should also be held
responsible for the incident." he added.
</P>
<P>
"MOFTEC will notify all cross-strait contract fishing labor
service companies to stop cooperation with the Taiwanese companies
involved," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that in general terms normal cooperation
should not be affected by the incident as the business has become
important and beneficial to both sides.

</P>
<P>
"A new model contract on providing crew for fishing boats
across the Taiwan Straits is being drafted and will be made
available soon," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mainland companies involved in providing such services will
also establish liaison groups so as to open dialogue with
relevant fishery organizations on the Taiwan side.
</P>
<P>
"We hope such moves will help exchange information, handle
disputes and other emerging incidents," he said. "We also hope
that the Taiwan authorities will pay attention to the problems,
help resolve them and ensure that this lucrative business grows."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang said China should have jurisdiction over the
case because it involves Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
The case is now being handled by the judicial department of
Mauritius where the ship docked after the killings, and the
Chinese embassy there is keeping a close eye on developments.

<P>
Athletics confirms as the unquestionable king of the sport with
1,134 athletes, followed by volleyball and basketball with 525 and

<HEADLINE> Surprise Find of Rare Hemlock Trees in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Wild hemlock trees, whose origins
can be dated back to the age of dinosaurs, have recently been
found on Mao'er Mountain, a protected natural reserve in southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,300 of the rare trees, a species under first-class
national protection similar to that which applies to the giant
panda in China, were found more than 1,200 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The natural reserve, founded in 1996, is especially renowned
for its hemlock trees but the number was formerly thought to be
only around 1,000. The new find has increased the figure to over 2,
300.
</P>
<P>
The hemlock trees found here are in an early stage of growth
with the largest having a trunk diameter of three meters.
</P>
<P>
The hemlock habitat has been threatened by human activities
with the number shrinking by an estimated half a dozen a year
since 1979, according to botanists working in the reserve.
</P>
<P>
They said it is important to improve people's awareness of
protecting the rare tree to keep it from extinction, because it is
difficult to grow hemlock artificially. Such a species takes at
least five years to grow a mere 10 centimeters tall.
</P>
<P>
Botanists in Guangxi are devoted to protecting rare plant
resources in the region, which enjoys favorable sub-tropical
weather. They have successfully relocated 167 kinds of rare
species, accounting for 41 percent of the total varieties of
nationally-protected plants, to an arboretum spanning some 1.33 ha.
in a bid to save them from extinction.

Yongzai, a well known Chinese expert in the field.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that one day the elderly could even have
robot servants to look after their daily needs," Song said in his
speech, entitled Control and Automation Beyond the Century. "And
when the IFAC, which was first formed in 1957, convenes its 31st
congress, each participant could have a robot secretary instead of
today's electronic notebook."
</P>
<P>
He said the investigation into and emulation of human
intelligence is actively being pursued by scientists working in
the automation field. It took 10,000 years for mankind to hobble
from the Neolithic Era to the era of mechanization. However, it
took only 100 years to step up from mechanized to electronic
automation.
</P>
<P>
"It may take still several decades to reach intelligent
automation, and to uplift the IQ level of robots to that of early
Homo Sapiens," Song said as many scientists argue that new
principles need to be discovered, or the known laws of physics be
modified to fully understand and imitate human intelligence, and
design and manufacture highly intelligent automatic control
systems.
</P>
<P>
"But in any case, the process has already started," said Song.
The astonishing achievements of microelectronics, life sciences
and automation technology in the second half of the 20th century
have created a sound starting point for advancement to intelligent
control and automation into the next century.

<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua)-- An unusually hot and dry spell with
high temperatures lasting around 11 days ended today with rain
falling on most of North China, the Central Meteorological Station
reported.
</P>
<P>
From June 24, high temperatures hovering above 35 degrees
Celsius left residents sweltering in Beijing, Tianjin and much of
Northern China. The highest temperature, 40.1 degrees Celsius, was
recorded in Baoding City of North China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
But starting from yesterday, rain fell in North China, finally
pushing the air temperature below 35 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Automation Science, Technology to Benefit Human's Life in 21st Century (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tremendous progress has taken place in control theory,
automation techniques and their applications. Control and
automation have proliferated into all industries including
manufacturing, agriculture, communications, aeronautics,
astronautics and service industries.
</P>
<P>
Robotics now dominate most mass production lines. As a result,
productivity has been lifted by tenfold or even a hundredfold, man
's capacity to invent and innovate enhanced, industrial products
enriched, with the working and living conditions of human-beings
improved to a level beyond expectation half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
In all walks of life today, automation is ubiquitous. The
communications and financial industries are almost completely
computer-automated. The automation level of medical facilities is
enhanced daily and automated domestic appliances have become
indispensable in the home.
</P>
<P>
Song revealed that in recent years, such high levels of
automation and control have also been widely applied in political,
military and social sciences. Many state leaders have begun to
understand the importance of the control theory, its concepts and
methodology.
</P>
<P>
He said that the applications of the control theory and
automation should continue to expand in the 21st century. Control
scientists are to be invited to lend a hand in finding solutions
to many issues of global importance, such as the prevention of
financial crises, population control, food security, protection of
the eco-system along with the forecasting and control of climatic
changes.
</P>
<P>
The IFAC aims to promote scientific research and technological
development in the field of automatic control and applications in
the broadest sense in all systems, including engineering, physical,
biological, environmental, social, economic and computational
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The number of its member countries has increased from 18 in
1957 to the current 50 and it now holds a world congress every
three years.

<P>
-- After a hastily arranged meeting on Sunday between President
Bill Clinton and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, U.S.
officials said they had received assurances that Pakistan would
withdraw forces that had crossed into the Indian portion of
Kashmir six weeks ago and triggered an escalation of fighting
between the world's two newest nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton begins a four-day, six-state tour to some
of the nation's most impoverished areas on Monday, saying that the
government and private sector should do more to bring the benefits
of a booming economy to regions that continue to struggle.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Sharif of Pakistan met in Washington with
President Clinton for three hours of hastily arranged talks
designed to defuse the conflict in Kashmir. Officials held out the
prospect that Pakistani backed forces would withdraw from Indian-
held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
-- President Hafez Al-Assad of Syria is scheduled to arrive in
Moscow on Monday as the first step in an expected flurry of Middle
East diplomacy. Arab and Israeli leaders are jockeying for

<HEADLINE> Philippines Has New Central Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Rafael Buenaventura formally assumed
the post of the Philippine Central Bank governor on Monday,
following Gabriel Singson's retirement after more than 43 years in
public service.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura served as president of the Philippine Commercial
Industrial Bank before his appointment to the current position.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said Monday morning that he
hopes Buenaventura would help his administration by defending the
country's financial stability.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the office of the central bank governor is a
sensitive post as the direction of the country's economy largely
depends on its decisions and policies.
</P>
<P>
The president said he will continue to respect and uphold its
independence.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who said he is sad to see Singson go, described
Singson as "one of the best" governors of the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence, however, that Buenaventura, his former
classmate at the Ateneo de Manila University, can continue the
financial stability achieved under Singson's watch.
</P>
<P>
"I have great confidence in him. Not because he was my
classmate, but because he has experience in international and
domestic banking," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also lauded Singson for helping his
administration parry the worst lashings of the Asian economic
crisis by keeping interest rates down.

<HEADLINE> Education Ministry Clamps Down On Bad Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- New regulations was introduced
today which will streamline services for Chinese students to study
abroad at their own expense.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to regularize and monitor the management of
intermediary agencies some of which have been providing illegal
services when increasing numbers of Chinese people apply to study
abroad.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed today by Wei Yu, vice minister of Education,
who stressed such agencies in future will have to get approval by
the local education and public security departments, obtain
qualifications validated by the ministries of education and public
security and be officially registered before being allocated a
business license.
</P>
<P>
"A more efficient and better standard of service will be
provided for applicants now that this regulation has been issued,"
Wei noted.
</P>
<P>
It will help put into effect the three basic principles for
overseas study: supporting Chinese people to study abroad;
encouraging them to return to China after graduation; and the
freedom to come and go, the official said.
</P>
<P>
She urged departments concerned to exert greater efforts to
curb the illegal activities of some intermediary agencies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that a total of 567,000 Chinese people went
abroad for further learning at their own expense between 1986 and
1998.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Five projects totaling more
than 40 million U.S. dollars aimed at promoting trade and
investment in southern Africa were unveiled during the second day
of the World Economic Forum's regional summit in Durban, South
Africa, Monday.
</P>
<P>
The projects were supported by the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (Opic) of the United States, South African Press
Association said.
</P>
<P>
Opic is a U.S. federal agency which promotes business in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The five projects are:
</P>
<P>
-- three-million-dollar support for Angolan battery
manufacturer AMT, which is expected to support 127 jobs in Luanda
and strengthen that country' s manufacturing base;
</P>
<P>
-- a 24.9-million-dollar loan to American Commodity Associates
in Angola to enable the company to build and operate a food
production facility which will create 350 jobs;
</P>
<P>
-- a five-million-dollar investment in Lesotho by Seaboard
Overseas Corporation in the privatization, restructuring and
operation of a flour mill; and
</P>
<P>
-- through its sponsorship of the New Africa Fund, Opic will
support two new investments in Namibia and South Africa totaling
eight million dollars. In Namibia, three million dollars will help
FM du Toit Transportation Company provide refrigerated transport
for perishable items between the two countries. The balance will
assist DTB, a subsidiary of African Broadcast Network, in South
Africa, to form alliances with local broadcasters to lower
operating costs.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to be very excited about the level of interest and
 commitment on behalf of US investors in this region," said Opic
President George Munoz during a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Munoz said Opic had a very strong portfolio in the region and
expected it to continue to grow in the short and medium term.
</P>
<P>
About 850 delegates, far more than anticipated, are attending
the Southern African Economic Summit at Durban's International
Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
They include southern African heads of state and political and
business leaders from the United States, Europe, Asia and the rest
of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the theme of responsible leadership in the region,
the three- day summit has brought state and business leaders
together in a workshop atmosphere to determine priorities and a
course of action to ensure economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Delegates have been at pains to emphasize that the conference
is not just a public relations exercise, but that concrete steps
should and will be taken to ensure and enhance greater economic
development and cooperation among the 14-member Southern African
Development Community (SADC) states.
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki and Trade Minister Alec
Erwin signaled Sunday that the member states were close to
implementing a regional free trade agreement, but cautioned that
there were still difficulties to overcome.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said South Africa's parliament was expected to ratify a
SADC trade protocol in time for implementation by January next
year.
</P>
<P>
SADC trade ministers will meet next week to thrash out thorny
issues impeding implementation of the agreement.

Arthorn Chantavimol, secretary to the Office of the Committee
on Natural Cultures, was quoted by the Thai News Agency as saying
that results of a recent survey of Thai restaurants and food
houses in Los Angeles showed that the most popular Thai dish among
American consumers was "Phad Thai".
</P>
<P>
The Office of the Committee on Natural Cultures then reached an
agreement with the Thai Press Club in Los Angeles to further
conduct a survey and collect information to find out "Phad Thai"
formula that best suits the taste of the Americans, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The project is aimed at promoting and proliferating Thai food
in the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
A team of foreign surveyors would be sent to Los Angeles to
taste "Phad Thai" at 20-30 restaurants and food houses, which
would be members of the initiative project, Arthorn elaborated.
</P>
<P>
A restaurant or food house selected by the team as having the
"Phad Thai" formula that best suits the taste of the Americans
would be invited to launch training courses to spread the formula
to other member restaurants or food houses, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the project will be expanded to other Thai
dishes, also popular among the Americans, he said.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Yearly 40 Billion Dollars Needed to Provide Basic Social </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said here Monday that it would cost about 40 billion U.
S. dollars per year to achieve the basic goal of poverty
eradication worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"The goal of eradicating poverty is the primary focus of this
council," Annan said when speaking at the opening meeting of the
1999 substantive session of the Economic and Social Council (
ECOSOC).
</P>
<P>
"It may be an ambitious goal, but it is not utopian," he went
on, "The progress that has been made these past few decades has
shown us what can be done and how to do it."
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that it has been estimated that the total
additional investment required to achieve universal access to
basic social services -- education, health, nutrition,
reproductive health, family planning, safe water and sanitation --
would be roughly 40 billion dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
To explain it, Annan said that that amount of money is less
than what Europeans spend on cigarettes, and one tenth of the
world trade in illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. chief said, non-industrialized countries,
which can least afford to divert their resources, spend more than
three times as much on their militaries.

<HEADLINE> 4 Cambodian Volunteers to Assist in East Timor Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Four Cambodian volunteers will
join the 400 polling officers recruited by the U.N. Volunteers
(UNV) to assist East Timor in a direct ballot in August to
determine whether the territory will stay in Indonesia or gain
independence.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Cambodians are being posted abroad
for election-related work, according to a news release issued by
the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
All the four volunteers were involved as monitors and observers
during the 1998 Cambodian national election. With other polling
officers, they will assist with voter registration, maintain
election records and select and supervise local staff.
</P>
<P>
The four Cambodians were dispatched along with five other
international volunteers from Cambodia on June 28 for a two-month
assignment. They are now in Australia for training and may arrive
in East Timor this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The UNV program in Cambodia is the largest and most diversified

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy PM Leaves for Moscow for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz left here Monday for Moscow for talks with Russian officials
on issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that he would also attend a world meeting of former
foreign ministers due to be held in Moscow on Wednesday, the
Iraqi News Agency INA reported
</P>
<P>
Aziz said former foreign ministers will discuss at the meeting
many international and regional issues and exchange views on the
political, environmental and social challenges facing the world.
</P>
<P>
Aziz's visit to Moscow came at a time when the U.N. Security
Council is locked in a deadlock as to how to deal with the Iraqi
issue.
</P>
<P>
U.N. arms inspections in Iraq have come to a halt since the
U.S. and Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq last December.
</P>
<P>
Russia, France, Britain and the Netherlands have submitted
their proposals on the Iraqi issue to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Russia, supported by France and China, proposed to lift all
the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 and to enhance the
ongoing monitoring and verification mechanism in Iraq under which
the unresolved disarmament issues of the Iraqi military programs
will be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Netherlands proposed to suspend the sanctions
against Iraq on the condition that Iraq fully cooperates with an
enlarged body of weapons inspectors, which will replace the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and carry out more intrusive
inspections of Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has clearly voiced its rejection to the British-Dutch
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad called the proposal "dubious" and aimed at reforging
the U.N. Security Council resolutions and tries to find new
pretexts to launch fresh aggressions against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> PNA Insists on Refugees' Right to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official has
rejected a recent U.S. proposal to compensate Palestinian refugees
in lieu of their return home.
</P>
<P>
In an interview broadcast Monday by the Voice of Palestine,
deputy head of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Mahmoud
Abbas (also known as Abu Mazen) said the proposal was not new.
</P>
<P>
He said the return of refugees to their homes is a
legitimate right and the issue will come up for discussion during
the final status negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
On the convening of an Arab summit, Abu Mazen said that 15
Arab states have already agreed to attend the summit meeting,
asserting that it has become an urgent necessity in the light of
the current changes in the region.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Morocco proposed to hold an expanded Arab summit,
upon the failure of efforts to convene a five-way summit due to
Syria's rejection.
</P>
<P>
Egypt had called for a five-way summit of
Jordan, Egypt, Syrian, Lebanon and the Palestinians to coordinate
Arab stances on peace talks with Israel after moderate Labor party
leader Ehud Barak won the May elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak pledged before the elections to revive all tracks of the
peace process which had been stalled due to the hard-line polices
pursued by the outgoing prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Militiamen in Somalia Take Action Against Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The tolerance of Somalis for the
illegal roadblocks seems to be wearing out especially in south
Mogadishu and the roads leading to the southern regions.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen-supported militiamen of the Islamic courts are
now further spreading their influence and control as they continue
their struggle in the creation of peaceful environment for the
business activities and the smooth flow of traffic by fighting
the outlawed militiamen manning the illegal roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
In a latest round of operation, militiamen of the four Islamic
courts attacked early Monday morning several illegal roadblocks
north of Mogadishu. The operation was unexpected and the heavy
exchange of gunfire between the Islamic courts' militiamen and the
bandits has awakened the people in the area.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Omar Sabriyeh, head of the operations for the Islamic
courts, told reporters after the operation that they successfully
removed seven roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses in the area said the bandits were less armed and
were forced to flee for their lives firing at every direction.
Sabriyeh said their operation attended by ten battle wagons and
130 well-equipped men was pre-planned and well organized.
</P>
<P>
"We've apprehended seven of the bandits and confiscated their
weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the operation, the courts' militiamen did not suffer
any casualties and nobody knows about the fled bandits, said
Sabriyeh.
</P>
<P>
People residing in the area said the bandits did not only
extort money from the commercial activities but most often also
killed and raped women. They also complained that the bandits
also stopped the milk coming from the countryside to reach the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Residents living near the neighborhood, one of the most
populated areas of the capital, have expressed relief at the
presence of the Islamic courts in their streets Monday. However,
some of them worried that the bandits will return and even do a
lot worse in retaliation if the Islamic militiamen leave the
area.
</P>
<P>
In a similar operation along the road leading to Afgoie town,
30 km south of Mogadishu two days ago, the Islamic courts'
militiamen killed a man and apprehended three others after they
attacked bandits who were extorting money from two public
transport buses operating on the road.  During the exchange of
fire, one of the Islamic militiamen has suffered gunshot wounds,
while the killed bandit was left hanging from a tree as a stern
warning for the other possible bandits.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, voluntary businessmen attacked five illegal
roadblocks near Bulo Marer Village, about 180 km south of
Mogadishu Sunday. The businessmen-supported militiamen have
cleared all five illegal roadblocks and captured four bandits in
the process.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Plans to Stabilize Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian government will soon come up
 with a plan on adjusting the economy and propping up the value of
its currency, naira.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Vice-President Atiku Abubakar made the announcement
Sunday, according to Monday's Daily Times.
</P>
<P>
"We are right now working out a blueprint to shore up the
value of the naira," said Atiku.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president seemed to have put some hopes on the
retrieval of the looted money and its impact on the recovery of
Nigeria's economy.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are on to retrieve stolen money stashed away in foreign
accounts, and hopefully this will help to improve Nigeria's
financial situation, said Atiku.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 55 billion U.S. dollars are
deposited in secret accounts in foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Many people, said the vice president, had promised to
facilitate the location, negotiation and release of the loot of
the family of Sani Abacha, Nigeria's ex-military leader, but are
demanding a certain percentage as commission for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are going on. But it is a slow and complicated
process. Some of those who are holding the money want commission,
said the vice- president.

<HEADLINE> HK Technology Commission Submits Final Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Professor Chang-Lin Tien,
chairman of the Chief Executive's Commission on Innovation and
Technology, said here Monday that Hong Kong has the capability to
become a knowledge-driven and technology-intensive economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after submitting the commission'
s second and final report to Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa, Tien said he was optimistic that Hong Kong should be able to
achieve noticeable results in this field in three to five years
and reap substantial benefits in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Professor Tien said he was delighted by the change from
skepticism to general acceptance in public attitude toward
innovation and technology in the past year.
</P>
<P>
"Technology is advancing and changing so rapidly that Hong Kong
is not really behind its regional competitors. More important,
Hong Kong must leverage on its areas of strength and develop its
own niches," Professor Tien said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong should not promote high tech for the sake of high
tech. Instead, it should encourage firms in all economic sectors
to innovate, by introducing improved technology and methods, by
penetrating new market segments and by entering into activities of
higher value," Professor Tien added.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the commission puts forward proposals to the
chief executive with regard to institutional arrangements,
building up human capital, fostering an innovation and technology
culture, creating an enabling business environment and setting up
an innovation and technology fund and an applied science and
technology research institute.
</P>
<P>
The publication of the report Monday marked the completion of
the commission's task.
</P>
<P>
Regarding institutional arrangements, the report recommends the
establishment of a policy group headed by the financial secretary
and comprising relevant bureau secretaries to set and coordinate
policies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government should set up a standing advisory
body reporting to the chief executive to succeed the commission on
innovation and technology.
</P>
<P>
Some full-time science advisers should be appointed to support
the proposed new setup, the commission suggested.
</P>
<P>
As for non-government public institutions, the report
recommends that the Hong Kong Science Park, Hong Kong Industrial
Estates Corporation and the Hong Kong Industrial Technology Center
Corporation be merged and the division of responsibility among
various institutions involved in service delivery be sharpened.
</P>
<P>
For building up human capital, the report recommends such
measures as continuing to invest heavily in education; stepping up
overseas liaison and promotion efforts targeting especially at
Chinese talents and technology entrepreneurs by the government;
and admitting talents from China's mainland to work in Hong Kong
quota-free.
</P>
<P>
The commission's first report was released in October 1998 and
the main recommendations in the report were accepted by the chief
executive in his 1998 Policy Address.
</P>
<P>
These included setting up a 5 billion HK dollar (641 million U.
S. dollars) Innovation and Technology Fund and an Applied Science
and Technology Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Upon receiving the second report, Tung said the two reports of
the commission had constructed a comprehensive road map for Hong
Kong to develop into a knowledge-driven and technology-intensive
economy.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased by the noticeable gathering of interests and
action in the community toward this new direction for Hong Kong,"
he said. Tung added that the government would carefully study the
recommendations in the final report so as to decide how they
should be taken forward.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Office of the Macao
government has decided to put emphasis on attracting more tourists
from the mainland areas of China this year.
</P>
<P>
The strategy was made as the number of tourists from the
mainland has been growing drastically in recent years, according
to sources with the Tourism Office.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that more than 1.3 million persons
from China's mainland areas came to Macao in 1998, an increase of
50 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
During the first two months of this year, 238,000 tourists from
the mainland paid visit to Macao. And the number doubled that in
the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In addition, tourists from the mainland stayed in Macao for
four to five days on the average. In contrast, tourists from other
regions spent only 1.4 days on the average.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthening Management of Pesticide Imports, Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China is strengthening its
management of pesticide import and export with a registration
procedure, in a bid to protect the ecological environment and
people's lives.
</P>
<P>
A notice jointly issued by the Ministry of Agriculture (MA) and
the General Administration of Customs (GAC) recently has called
for registration of pesticide imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
According to the notice, any unit that hopes to be engaged in
pesticide import and export business are obliged to apply to the
MA, which is authorized to issue Certificates of Pesticide Import
and Export Registration (CPIER) to qualified applicants.
</P>
<P>
Units that want to import or export pesticides ranked in the
Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedures must also apply to the MA,
the notice says.
</P>
<P>
PIC pesticides can only be imported with the approval of the MA,
while the export of such pesticides can be conducted after the MA
has sought the consent of the importing country and issued CPIER,
the notice stresses.
</P>
<P>
The GAC will handle pesticide import and export procedures
according to CPIERs issued by the MA. Imports or exports of
pesticides without CPIERs will be strictly banned, the notice
stipulates.
</P>
<P>
Each CPIER can only be used once within its valid duration of
time and the contents can not be altered. And if they need to be
altered, the import and export unit has to apply to the MA for a
new CPIER, the notice notes.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of CPIERs are handled by the Pesticide Appraisal
Institute under the MA, according to the notice.
</P>
<P>
An official from the MA says that the notice is aimed at
implementing China's Regulations on Pesticide Management and
fulfilling the International Convention on the PIC Procedures for
Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticide in International Trade
by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the U.N.
Environment Program.
</P>
<P>
The notice became effective as of July 1, 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC)
has stepped up its credit support to poor areas in the western
parts of China in keeping with the central government's efforts to
boost local economic development.
</P>
<P>
ABC data show that by the end of May, the bank had granted
loans of 30.6 billion yuan (3.69 billion U.S. dollars) to western
provinces and autonomous regions for integrated agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
In response to the call of the central government, the ABC has
launched an extensive poverty-relief project. In the first four
months this year, the bank made arrangements for earmarking a
total of 10.3 billion yuan (1.24 billion U.S. dollars) in poverty-
relief credit.
</P>
<P>
This year the bank plans to increase its poverty-relief loans
to 15 billion yuan (1.81 billion U.S. dollars), accounting for 60
percent of the central government's planned poverty-relief loans.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that from 1986 to May this year, the ABC
arranged 55.36 billion yuan (6.67 billion U.S. dollars) in poverty-
relief loans but 67.6 billion yuan (8.14 billion U.S. dollars) had
actually been disbursed, with the lion's share going to western
areas.
</P>
<P>
Bank sources said that the ABC's targeted key sectors in
western China include rural power network, energy, transportation,
telecommunications, and water, cooking gas and electricity supply
in towns, as well as medical facilities.

MANILA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- In order to generate job

maximize the use of labor-based methods in government projects,
Public Works and Highways Department Secretary Gregorio R. Vigilar

The LB-ES program also aims to optimize labor as the main
component in constructing government infrastructure, minimizing
reliance on expensive equipment and machinery for small and medium
scale projects, Vigilar said.

He added that LB-ES will be institutionalized as the technology
of first choice in projects worth 2 million pesos (50,000 U.S.

<HEADLINE> Blair Tries to Sell Peace Plan to Protestant Unionists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Monday tried to persuade Protestant Unionists into accepting his
new peace plan, saying that a Northern Ireland government could be
formed without Sinn Fein if the Irish Republican Army fails to
disarm.
</P>
<P>
"If at any point in time, including after the first few days,
the IRA and (its political wing) Sinn Fein do not hold to the
commitments they have given, then the process is simply unwound,"
he told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Protestant leaders have resisted pressure from London and
Dublin to agree to proposals under which they would sit with the
republican Sinn Fein party in a new provincial executive in
exchange for a pledge, but no proof, that IRA guerrillas would
give up their arms by next May.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments put forward the proposals
last week in a bid to break the deadlock over guerrilla
disarmament which has jeopardized last year's Good Friday peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
The Protestant Unionists, who back British rule, have accused
Blair of making too many concessions to the Catholics, who wanted
to link up with the Irish Republic. But Blair insisted there were
what he called "fail-safe" guarantees built into the blueprint for
peace.
</P>
<P>
"If the words aren't followed by actions...then the fail-safe
operates and we rewind the process with it being absolutely clear
that Sinn Fein go out of the executive. And if the other parties
can agree, then they can move forward together," Reuters quoted
him as saying. "It will be absolutely clear that the defaulting
party is Sinn Fein."
</P>
<P>
Blair, who is expected to make a statement to parliament on
Monday on the faltering drive for peace, pointed out that IRA
guarantees will have to be made to the independent commission set
up to oversee disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"They have to give to the independent commission a clear and
unambiguous statement, not just that the war is over, but that
they intend to decommission their weapons," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Ten Nigerian soldiers captured by the
rebels in Sierra Leone as prisoners of war (POW) were released to
the Nigerian government Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Minister Alhaji Sule Lamido received the POWs
in capital Abuja on behalf of the Nigerian government, according
to a Vanguard report Monday.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) led by Liberian Foreign Minister Monie Capran and his
Togolese counterpart Kokou Joseph Koffigo brought in the POWs and
handed them over to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Their release was made possible by the Liberian government
following four days of negotiations between the ECOWAS and the
rebel Revolutionary United Front (URF) of Sierra Leone, Lamido
said.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers who were in the west African peacekeeping force of
ECOMOG were captured when the rebels attacked their locations in
Sierra Leone since the overthrow of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
One of the released soldiers said they were kept in detention
for periods ranging from six to 14 months, but added that they
were well treated while in detention.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the URF is still holding some 300 Nigerian
soldiers.

PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After French President Jacques Chirac rejected a demand by
the government to amend the constitution in order to accept the
European Charter on Regional Languages, the issue has become the
topic of a hot debate in France, which has a dozen regional tones.
</P>
<P>
-- Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika pardened thousands
of Islamists on Sunday on the eve of the 37th anniversary of
independence of the country. The number of the prisoners to be
released is estimated from 5,000 to 15,000. But the fate of Ali
Benhadj, the only leader of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (
FIS) still remaining in prison, is unknown.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In a political atmosphere marked by uncertainty, the
traditional procession of North Ireland Orangist Protestants went
on in the small city Portadown on Sunday without accident. The
demonstrators were stopped from marching toward the Catholic
district of Garvaghy Road for a second consecutive year. The
proposal by Britain and Ireland on power sharing between
Protestants and Catholics was torn apart by the loyalists, who
condemned London for yielding to the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
-- After pardoning thousands of Islamists imprisoned for
terrorist activities on Sunday, Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika is expected to announce on Monday other measures aimed
at seeking national reconciliation, including the lifting of the
state of emergency imposed since 1992, the release of FIS leader
Abassi Madani from house arrest, and launching an inquiry into the
"disappeared" during the seven years of violence.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with more details Annan Calls for Promotion of Balanced World Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday called on the industrial nations to enact
policies that will promote higher and more balanced rates of world
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here at the opening ceremony of the U.N. Economic and
Social Council's 1999 substantive session, Annan said, "A world
economy growing at two percent per year will not provide the
resources or the enabling environment for a war on poverty."
</P>
<P>
Some two billion young people in the developing world are
unemployed or under-employed, Annan told the session. About 37
million people in countries of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) are jobless.
</P>
<P>
While the global community can celebrate many remarkable gains
in living standards and in the struggle against poverty, Annan
went on, there is an inescapable blot on this record of
achievement: the extent of global poverty, in rich and poor
countries alike.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, the world population was four billion and the number
of people living in absolute poverty was estimated at one quarter
of the total, the U.N. chief recalled.
</P>
<P>
Today, he said, world population has increased to six billion,
but half the world population is mired in poverty, trying to eke
out a living on three dollars a day or less.
</P>
<P>
"So our choice is clear: we can expand the world economy, or we
can see social exclusion take even deeper root, with all-too-
predictable consequences," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan also suggested that the global community, through aid,
through trade, and through its decision-making at the United
Nations and elsewhere, give the highest priority to meeting the
basic needs of the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
His third suggestion for where to start eradicating poverty is
"to do more to advance the prospects of women".
</P>
<P>
"Women are among the poorest of the poor," Annan said. "By
right and by reason, women must have equal opportunities."

OTTAWA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Three people died and another is
still missing following a helicopter crash Sunday some 700
kilometers east of Vancouver, local reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 214 Bell helicopter went down around 6:30 a.m. (local time)
during a maintenance flight at a logging camp in the Kootenay
region, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
"Witnesses have said that it did come out of the sky, rotated
and crashed in a creek bed," a police officer told a Vancouver
radio.
</P>
<P>
The crash site is inaccessible by road. Emergency personnel had
to be airlifted in to investigate, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Elections Commission Denies Postponement of MPR Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's General Elections
Commission (KPU) Monday refuted reports on the postponement of the
general session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the
country's highest decision-making body.
</P>
<P>
The MPR session, which will elect a new president and vice
president, will be convened as scheduled on October 1-3, KPU
Deputy Chairman Adnan Buyung Nasution said here.
</P>
<P>
He said this schedule, which has been approved by the
government, is the one sanctioned by the KPU.
</P>
<P>
Buyung said the KPU is confident that the general session of
the MPR will stick to the original schedule of October 1-3,
despite the postponement of the national vote count from June 21
to July 6.
</P>
<P>
In its letter to the House of Representatives (DPR)
secretary-general dated June 18, the KPU said the first stage of
the MPR session would begin on October 1 following the induction
of the 700-member of MPR. Members of the body will reconvene in
November to elect a president and endorse decrees deliberated
during the first phase of the general session.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a group of legislators last Friday, President
B.J. Habibie said the presidential election might be postponed to
December, one month after originally planned. Habibie said vote
counting delays in the June 7 general election made it likely that
the new parliament and the MPR would not convene until late
September, which would push back the presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
The president's comment was criticized by opposition leaders
and political experts.
</P>
<P>
Muhaimin Iskandar, secretary general of the National Awakening
Party (PKB), said any delay would only pave the way for "unhealthy
political maneuvers."
</P>
<P>
Amien Rais, chairman of the National Mandate Party (PAN), said
the delay would only result in uncertainty and suspicions. "It is
not impossible that the delay would incite protests from students
and people," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional law experts Sri Soemantri and Satya Arinanto,
and political observers Hermawan Sulistyo and Marsilam Simanjuntak
observed that the postponement was politically motivated. They
warned that a delay of the MPR session would wreck havoc to the
country's political life.
</P>
<P>
The delay could pose a threat to national unity as well as
economic recovery, which many have said relied much on political
stability, Hermawan said.
</P>
<P>
The MPR would be made up of 462 elected legislators and 38
military appointees and 200 provincial representatives.
</P>
<P>
Only more than 60 percent of the votes in the June 7 general
election have been counted so far. The Indonesian Democratic
Party of Struggle maintains a commanding 35-percent lead, trailed
by the ruling Golkar Party with 22 percent.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Mayon Volcano Shows Inflationary Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Mayon Volcano in the central
Philippines continued to show inflationary trend as instruments
around the mountain registered high frequency volcanic tremor
Sunday night, volcanologists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs)
said Monday morning in a report that on Sunday, moderate levels of
steam emission rose up to about 100 meters and the sulfur dioxide
flux measurement was 4,100 tons per day.
</P>
<P>
Phivolcs said Mayon Volcano's alert status remains at Alert
level 2, but for safety the 6-km radius Permanent Danger Zone in
the southeast sector of the volcano was extended to 7 km.
</P>
<P>
As an additional precautionary measure, residents near the
volcano's slopes should be alert against hazards from sudden
explosions, Phivolcs said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada appealed Monday to
residents living near Mayon Volcano to cooperate with regional
authorities and prepare to evacuate as soon as the situation
becomes critical.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a radio interview that while authorities
have said Mayon is not likely to erupt yet, residents should
remain alert and should make the necessary preparations.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who flew Sunday
to the volcano area in a helicopter, declared the "highest alert"
around restive Mayon Volcano and ordered evacuation preparation in
case of an eruption.
</P>
<P>
But Raymundo Punongbayan, director of Phivolcs, said that he
didn't know yet if the current activity will definitely lead to an
eruption.
</P>
<P>
Phivolcs earlier said an eruption could occur in days or weeks
if the ominous signs persisted.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that if a major eruption occurs, 12,359
families or 63,055 persons near the volcano would have to be
evacuated to 52 designated evacuation centers.
</P>
<P>
Looming over half a dozen towns in Albay province, Mayon
erupted 45 times in the past 360 years.
</P>
<P>
The deadliest was in 1814 when it buried a whole town and
killed 1,200 villagers. At least 77 people died in its last
eruption in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Latvian Prime Minister to Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Latvian Prime Minister Vilis
Kristopans said Monday that he would tender his resignation to
President Guntis Ulmanis later in the day, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kristopans told a radio interview that his decision to step
down was related to "a conspiratorial and subversive agreement"
reached Saturday by the governing coalition and the opposition
People's Party while he was attending an international economic
forum in Salzburg, Austria.
</P>
<P>
"The sole cause of my resignation is the recent atmosphere of
mistrust in the Cabinet. I cannot continue to work as prime
minister while political groups represented on the Cabinet hold
talks and sign agreements behind my back with an opposition party
concerning the formation of a new Cabinet," he said.
</P>
<P>
People's Party leader Gundars Berzins said Kristopans'
resignation would pave the way for the Popular Party, Latvian Way
and For Fatherland and Freedom, the three largest parties in the
Baltic country, to form a new cabinet, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The government has come under criticism for the slow pace of
privatization but Kristopans said his cabinet, formed last October,
had successfully reduced the interest rate on state debts and the
current balance of payment deficit, cut down inflation and brought
about more investment.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Keep Flexible Exchange Rate System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian central bank, Bank
Indonesia (BI), pledged to adhere to a flexible exchange rate
system as a consequence of the integration of the Indonesian
economy with the world economy marked by the increasing role of
foreign trade and the flow of foreign capitals into the economy.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we are willing to integrate our economy with the
global one, the flexible exchange rate system is the best choice,"
BI Governor Syahril Sabirin said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that if the country's economy gets stronger
and the foreign exchange reserves increase, the central bank will
introduce an alternative exchange rate system, such as a
controlled floating exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government introduced the flexible exchange rate
system in August 1997 after its economy was hit by Asian monetary
crisis. The value of the rupiah dropped by 80 percent to 17,000
per dollar in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since April this year, the rupiah has been stronger following
the recovery of economies around the region. The rupiah was traded
at 6,650 against the U.S. dollar Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the ideal exchange rate of the Indonesian rupiah
against the U.S. dollar should be between 6,000 and 6,500.
</P>
<P>
"By taking into consideration the various fundamental factors
in the Indonesian economy, including the competitiveness of export
commodities, we have estimated that the ideal exchange rate of the
rupiah against the U.S. dollar should range from 6,000 to 6,500,"
Sabirin told the House commission on finance and state budget.
</P>
<P>
He however reiterated that this ideal exchange rate is not the
goal of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"The market should determine the ideal exchange rate of the
rupiah against the dollar," he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian FM Regrets Over Incident in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas Monday said that he regretted over incidents in Liquica in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"I've been waiting for reports from our staff. But if it is
true, it deserves to be sorry and the actors must be investigated
and the real facts of the incident need to be clarified," he told
reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Alatas called for both pro-integration group and
pro-independence group to stop fighting each other.
</P>
<P>
According to East Timor police spokesman Capt. Widodo, the
incident broke out on Saturday noon at Loedaha village in Liquica
subdistrict, about 45 kilometers east of East Timor's capital
Dili.
</P>
<P>
A group of Falintil members reportedly attacked the
pro-integration Red-White Iron (BMP) group, shot two to death and
injured others. Falintil is the military wing of the
anti-integration Fretilin group.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, BMP group reportedly attacked a humanitarian convoy
leaving the town of Liquica, injuring some workers. A United
Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) vehicle was
accompanying the convoy when the attack took place and it had also
been targeted, a spokesman of the UNAMET said.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET has been deployed in East Timor ahead of a
U.N.-administered direct ballot scheduled for August to determine
the future of the territory.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara News Agency, local military district chief
Maj. Gen. Jeki Anwar Monday visited victims of Liquica shooting.
</P>
<P>
Regretting the clashes, Anwar said that any clashes in the
run-up to the direct ballot to determine the future of East Timor
should be avoided at all cost.
</P>
<P>
Clashes will never settle any problems and will not be
conducive to the peace efforts now being made, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We ask both parties to restrain themselves and avoid any acts
that may lead to clashes," he added.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Early this year the Indonesian government offered East Timor
independence if its people reject wide-ranging autonomy under
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed
to hold the direct ballot in August this year.

<HEADLINE> Gurkha Soldier's Body Flown Back to Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The body of Sergeant Balaram Rai,
who was killed with another British soldier in Kosovo, was flown
back home Monday from London via Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Rai's widow Ashanta Rai, her six-year-old son Salim and
four-year-old daughter Ashmita were among those to receive the
dead at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Ashanta began sobbing when her husband's body was lifted down a
mini bus. She never raised her head before her husband's body was
put on a military helicopter. She wiped her eyes now and then
while her two kids stared at her, unaware of the happening.
</P>
<P>
A military ceremony was held before the body was ferried to
Dharan in eastern Nepal, where Rai's parents live.
</P>
<P>
Rai was killed on June 21 while clearing land mines and booby
traps in Kosovo. He was from the 69th Gurkha Squadron which is
part of the British peacekeeping forces there.
</P>
<P>
His death has sparked fresh calls in Nepal for equal pay and
pension of Gurkha soldiers with their British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu Post said Rai's widow would receive from the
British government 30,165 U.S. dollars, an annual 1,484 dollars
pension for five years and then 1,218 dollars every year after
that.
</P>
<P>
A British sergeant's widow would receive 86,181 dollars, his
salary for six months and then 24,003 dollars every year, the
daily said.
</P>
<P>
Under a tripartite treaty between Nepal, Britain and India,
Nepalese nationals are permitted to volunteer for service in the
British and Indian armies. They are known as Gurkha soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Currently some 3,000 Gurkha soldiers are on active duty in the
British army.

<TEXT>
<P>
DURHAM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The 10th Special Olympic Summer
Games came to an end for its nine-day competitions Sunday when the
"Flame of Hope" was extinguished in Durham, a city in North
Carolina, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Shriver, president of the organizing committee, closed
the games, paying special tributes to 7,000 mentally retarded
athletes from 152 countries and regions who competed in 19 events
including aquatics, athletics, bowling, equestrian football,
roller skating, sailing softball and volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 spectators gathered at Duke University's Wallace
Wade Stadium for the closing ceremony featuring dances, music and
fireworks. They shared the stories of all of the people who made
the '99 Games possible: athletes, coaches, volunteers, family
members as well as local and international supporters of Special
Olympics. Their individual stories, of courage and triumph, are
what made the games successful, and they are the foundation of the
Special Olympics movement.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the games helped change perceptions of the
mentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
All the matches during the games were held at venues in Raleigh,
capital of North Carolina State, and the nearby towns of Durham,
Chapel Hill and Cary.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation has captured 18 gold, 14 silver and 15
bronze medals during the games.
</P>
<P>
The Special Olympics were founded in 1968 by Eunice Kennedy
Shriver, sister of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy. So far,
the SOI has staged 10 Summer Special Olympics Games and six winter
versions.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 Games operated with a 35.5 million U.S. dollars budget
which was funded by corporations, foundations service
organizations, individual contributions and grants.
</P>
<P>
The seventh Special Olympic Winter Games will be held in Alaska
State of the United States in 2001, while the 11th Special Olympic
Summer Games are expected to be held in Ireland in 2003.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday called on the industrial nations to enact
policies that will promote higher and more balanced rates of world
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here at the opening ceremony of the U.N. Economic and
Social Council's 1999 substantive session, Annan said, "A world
economy growing at two percent per year will not provide the
resources or the enabling environment for a war on poverty."
</P>
<P>
Some two billion young people in the developing world are
unemployed or under-employed, Annan told the session. About 37
million people in countries of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) are jobless.
</P>
<P>
"So our choice is clear: we can expand the world economy, or we
can see social exclusion take even deeper root, with all-too-
predictable consequences," Annan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic and
Social Council (ECOSOC) began the 1999 substantive session here
Monday with the intention of spear heading a global crusade
against poverty.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, ECOSOC President Paolo Fulci called on
the industrialized countries to do more in the world's fight
against poverty.
</P>
<P>
Fulci warned that in a world where the rich are becoming richer
and the poor becoming poorer, solidarity in the worldwide moral
campaign against poverty has more to do with enlightened self-
interest than with mere generosity.
</P>
<P>
"Either we progress together or we sink together," Fulci added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting from July 5 to 28, the ECOSOC will also try
to carry out its political plan to turn the last session of ECOSOC
this century into a "renaissance" of the council in order to re-
establish a central role for itself in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed after prolonged preliminary discussions and
debates in New York that a ministerial statement would be issued
at the Geneva meeting, outlining the upcoming process to reduce
world poverty by half by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the 54 members including China are present
at the opening.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Isolate Gene Related to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have isolated
the gene responsible for an enzyme that plays a central role in
the development and spreading of cancer cells and have created
antibodies to the enzyme, the Haaretz daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
These new discoveries open up a new range of possibilities for
the diagnosis and cure of cancer as well as other diseases in
which the enzyme is involved, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A joint research team led by Professor Israel Vlodavsky of the
Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center found that an enzyme called
heparanase is what allows cancer cells to move through the walls
of blood vessels to attack other body organs.
</P>
<P>
They also discovered that the enzyme is produced and excreted
in large quantities by cancer cells which have a strong potential
to metastasize, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
After successfully isolating the gene responsible for the the
enzyme, the research team created antibodies which, apart from
slowing down the enzyme, can be used as a method for diagnosing
high-risk secondary cancer growths.
</P>
<P>
The team also found that the enzyme is involved in other
diseases besides cancer. For instance, it is involved in white
blood cell movement toward inflamed areas of the body and
responsible for the movement of the self-attacking cells of the
body's immune system in auto-immune diseases.

CANBERRA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Two Australian cyclists have
tested positive to banned drugs, the Australian Sports Commission
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) which they are with
declined to name them until a hearing to determine if there has
been a breach of drug policy, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Three riders were suspended from the AIS for taking a dug with
permission of their coach or doctor. It is not yet known if the
positive tests relate to the suspension.
</P>
<P>
Australian Cycling Federation president Ray Godkin said that of
the three, 1,000 meters time trial rider Josh Kersten had been
cleared of wrongdoing but pursuit riders Tim O'Shannessey and Tim
Lyons remained under suspension, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Godkin said Lyons and O'Shannessey would rejoin the Australian

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Sector to Be Computerized in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Ministry of Agriculture,
Food and Fisheries is to computerize the agricultural sector
nationwide to facilitate information flow between the ministry and
stake-holders in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Monday quoted Peter Masunu,
director of National Agriculture Information Service, as saying
that plans were underway to connect all the districts and
provinces to facsimile and electronic mail systems in order to
enhance information flow in the agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
Masunu said the exercise would be completed before the end of
next year and that it would alleviate all communication problems
dogging the sector.
</P>
<P>
"The information network is and will be vital for the ministry
to know prices of commodities and to fix prices for particular
goods at a given time throughout the country," Masunu said.
</P>
<P>
He said small scale farmers have for a long time experienced
hardships as regards marketing and selling of their products, a
thing he said leads to economic disaster frequently faced by many
households in the country.
</P>
<P>
The market availability had been difficult to access mainly
because producers have been denied useful information on marketing
their products, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Both fax and E-mail facilities will be utilized adequately to
help small scale producers to compete with commercial farmers on
the market and there are proper channels which will be used to get
farmers complaints," he added.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Plans Introduction of New Burial Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
plans to introduce a new practice of burying the ashes of cremated
people under trees.
</P>
<P>
The new practice is expected to replace traditional burial
practices, including tomb burials. Officials expect so-called "
tree burials" to provide an effective means for ensuring the
protection of the environment and land resources which are
dwindling owing to tombs scattered throughout in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 29 million sq.m. will be used to build tombs over
the next ten years, with each tomb covering 10 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Mountains cover some 70 percent of Zhejiang's total land. The
per capita cultivated land has dropped to 0.04 ha. because of
rapid industrialization and urbanization over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Coastal areas with large population densities have suffered
greatly from increasingly serious soil erosion which has at least
in part been caused by the loss of green areas because of the
rising number of tombs.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the province has made headway in advocating the
practice of cremation in recent years is expected to facilitate
the introduction of "tree burials".
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou intends to introduce the practice on a trial basis
during the traditional Tomb Sweeping Festival in early April next
year.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Army Ready for Border Menace: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has put its
army on combat-ready alert following the escalating insecurity
along the country's border with its Horn of Africa neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times Monday quoted State Minister Marsden Madoka as
saying that Kenyan forces are on full alert for deployment for
any military operation to counter any form of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Madoka said Sunday that the insecurity posed by remnants of the
militia from Somalia and other neighboring countries cannot be
taken for granted and that a state of preparedness was needed to
resist cross-border incursions by hostile groups.
</P>
<P>
Madoka warned the Somali militia not to extend their factional
war into Kenya, noting that the Kenya-Somalia border will remain
closed for security purposes.
</P>
<P>
He also described the ambushing of Kenyan soldiers by Somali
militia last week as an isolated incident, adding that the aim of
the attack was to obtain firearms.
</P>
<P>
About 400 Somali militia robbed a Kenyan Army platoon of
rifles, ammunitions and vehicles last Tuesday but returned them
to Kenya later on Friday after Kenya gave an ultimatum and sent
jet-fighters over the territory into Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Most Lebanese See Israel as Threat to Peace: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 percent of the Lebanese
think Israel will still impose threat against Lebanon even after
it achieves peace with neighboring Arab countries, the results of
a survey have indicated.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the local research company MEDMA and
published by al Mustaqbal newspaper Monday, revealed that only
10.6 of the Lebanese think Israel will not be a threat to
Lebanon's economy, tourism, technology and military while 12.7
percent have no idea about the question.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was carried out between June 11 and 13,
involved 1000 individuals randomly interviewed from across Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It showed that only 8.8 percent of the Lebanese think Lebanon
should comprehensively normalize relations with Israel after the
Jewish state achieves peace with Arab countries while 13.4 percent
only agree on partial normalization of ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Some 66.4 percent of the interviewed are categorically opposed to
the normalization of relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The survey, whose first part had been published by the
newspaper last week, showed that 50 percent of the Lebanese don't
believe Israel will pull its forces out of south Lebanon in one
year as Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak promised during
his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five percent of the Lebanese don't think the election of
Barak will alter the pace of the Middle East peace process which
has been deadlocked in the three-year tenure of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
After his landslide victory over Netanyahu, Barak vowed to
withdraw Israeli forces from Lebanon within one year starting from
the formation of his coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The deadline set for forming the government is July 8.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> All Public Service Vehicles in Kenya to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has instructed that all public service vehicles must adhere to
the recently- introduced regulations by the Transport Licensing
Board.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks Sunday at a rally in Nakuru, a
city in central Kenya, that road accidents involving matatus
(min-buses) have claimed many lives of Kenyans and all operation
of public transport vehicles should be regulated, media reports
here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 30 people were killed in matatu clashes
last Saturday alone in the country due to the violation of the
traffic rules on the part of matatu drivers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Transport Licensing Board issued the
requirements that all matatus must be licensed and their
operational routes be re- allocated by the board.
</P>
<P>
However, the officials of the Matatu Owners Association refused
to implement the order and threatened to go on a strike
nationwide two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that matatu owners did not care about the travellers
who are killed by matatus on Kenyan roads daily, saying his
government would not tolerate any demonstration against the
requirements of the licensing board.
</P>
<P>
He also declared that "leadership required courage and the
truth is that matatus have killed many people, most of whom are
not adequately compensated. The board should enforce the rules."
</P>
<P>
The board's rules require that all matatus be licensed; matatu
drivers and conductors wear identification badges; re-allocation
of matatu routes be done by the board; and matatu owners pay road
licence, advance tax and insurance fee.

<HEADLINE> Thai Coalition Meeting on Reshuffle Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A meeting among the ruling
coalition of the Thai government, scheduled for later Monday, was
put off till Tuesday, Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was postponed because some partners of the
coalition need more time to discuss the reshuffle, Sanan, who is
also secretary-general of the core ruling party, the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
Though the parties should be allowed more time for discussion,
the government reshuffle would not drag on beyond this week, said
Sanan, who plays as chief mediator among the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that the posts of deputy industry minister
and deputy transportation and communication minister would be
allocated to Chart Pattana Party, the second largest party in the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
But Chart Pattana asked for a more important post of deputy
interior minister instead.
</P>
<P>
After a party meeting Monday morning, Chart Pattana Party
leader Korn Dabaransi said that it was still unclear which posts
would be given to his party.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that the postponement of the
coalition meeting reflected hard bargaining among coalition
partners.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said earlier that the reshuffle
would limit only on the seven seats left vacant by resignations.
</P>
<P>
However, it seemed now that the reshuffle will go beyond that
limitation, analysts said.

YANGON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar Monday called for preparing for food security to meet the
country's growing population which is estimated to reach 60
million by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's population was registered at 46.4 million in fiscal
year 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
There are about 9.3 million hectares of land in the country
used for cultivation, the paper said. Over 9 million hectares of
vacant and virgin land lie unreclaimed, and plans are under way to
reclaim them.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, since the beginning of this

wet lands have been reclaimed by private entrepreneurs in
Ayeyawaddy, Yangon, Bago, Magway, Tanintharyi divisions and Shan
state to cultivate crops.
</P>
<P>
Another official report said Myanmar is to reclaim 291,600
hectares more of such lands in Mon and Kayin states as a
follow-up.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's paddy production dropped steadily over the past few
years, from 19 million tons in fiscal 1995-96 to 17.3 million
tons in 1997-98.

<P>
COLOMBO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops Sunday
killed 10 Tamil rebels in separate clashes in the Northern
province, the Defense Ministry announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Government troops operating ahead of defenses observed a group

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Warns Against Selfish Clerics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has warned Kenyan Christians to be wary of opportunists who were
using various titles in the church to achieve their personal
interests.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times newspaper Monday quoted Moi as saying that such
people were out to cheat people by using the titles recognized by
various churches.
</P>
<P>
Moi said Sunday that titles such as "Reverend", "most Revered"
and "Right Reverend" were unnecessary in the church as Christians
worship only God.
</P>
<P>
What was happening around the world today was what is written
in the Bible, which says that toward the end of the world many
people will appear to confuse Christians using Christ's name,
said the president, whose own religion is Christianity.
</P>
<P>
He told the church to stop lamenting over the behavior of youth
and instead play a leading role in moulding them into responsible
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Moi also praised early Western missionaries who settled in Rift
Valley Province of central Kenya and brought the region
Christianity which had spread to other parts of Kenya.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 25 Wounded in Bomb Attack in Istanbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and 25 others
were wounded late Sunday night when a time bomb exploded in
Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, the Milliyet (National)
daily reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the bomb planted in a dustbin exploded in a
picnic place at Avcilar district of Istanbul, leaving one civilian
dead and 25 others, including women and children, injured.
</P>
<P>
Five of the injured people are in serious conditions, said the
the report.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul Governor Erol Cakir accused the rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) of being responsible for the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
This was the first suspected PKK explosion attack after a
Turkish court gave the death verdict to PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan
last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Hurriyet (Freedom) daily reported Monday that a
group of PKK supporters held a demonstration in the southeastern
city of Diyarbakir to protest the death sentence against Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkish special agents in Kenya in
mid-February and has ever since been detained on Imrali Island in
Marmara Sea near western Turkey's province of Bursa where he was
tried on charges of treason and separatism.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan-led PKK has been fighting a war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey since 1984. Conflicts
between the Turkish security forces and the PKK militants have
claimed over 37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Disappointed at U.S. Dairy Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister for
International Trade Lockwood Smith has expressed disappointment at
the U.S. latest announcement of allocations for a range of dairy
products under its Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP).
</P>
<P>
"I am frustrated that the U.S. is once again resorting to the
use of export subsidies" to improve the competitiveness of U.S.
dairy exports in international markets, Smith said in a statement
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I have repeatedly protested to the U.S. government about the
price distorting effects of export subsidies in an already
depressed global commodity market," he said, adding the use of any
export subsidy "undermines the strong messages that New Zealand
and the United States have together been sending to other major
users of export subsidies such as the European Union."
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand minister strongly urged the United States to
desist from subsidizing dairy exports.
</P>
<P>
"Such a move would be consistent with the U.S. credentials as a
leading proponent of free trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced on June 30 its
allocations for 1999/2000 under the DEIP. DEIP bonuses are being
made available this year for 76,207 metric tons of skim milk
powder, 2,518 metric tons of whole milk powder, 25,475 metric tons
of butterfat, and 3,190 metric tons of various cheeses.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand is one of the biggest exporters of dairy products
in the world. Its dairy industry earned around 3.7 billion NZ
dollars (2 billion U.S. dollars) in foreign exchange in the year
to June 1998.

<P>
MANILA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' year-on-year
inflation rate slowed down to 23-month low of 5.8 percent in June
from 6.7 percent in May, a report of National Statistics Office
said Monday.
</P>

most heavily-weighted on the consumer price index. The comparable
figure for May was 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the rate of clothing dropped to 6.0
percent in June from 6.7 percent in May, while the miscellaneous
items dropped to 4.8 percent from 5.3 percent.

in June from 8.9 percent in May.

3.9 percent in June from 4.7 in May, while the inflation rate for
areas outside Metro Manila moved down to 6.5 percent from 7.7
percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Not to Buy Maize for Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has said it
is impossible for it to find money to buy maize for strategic
reserves because this will put more pressure on the budget of this
year.
</P>
<P>
But the Zambia National Farmers Union has insisted that the
government should find an alternative way of funding the Food
Reserve Agency if the process is to go smoothly, Times of Zambia
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Suresh Desai, Zambian Minister of
Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, as saying Sunday that it is not
possible for the government to find money for this year's maize
marketing season, which falls on July to November.
</P>
<P>
Desai appealed to farmers to pay back fertilizer loans from
Food Reserve Agency to ensure this year's maize marketing season
to succeed.
</P>
<P>
The government will find it difficult to improve the
agriculture sector because of the major setbacks of non-repayment
of loans by the farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Desai said the farmers should stop demanding too much from the
government until they pay back what they borrow.

CHANGCHUN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Filming of "Mao Zedong and Snow,"
a screen adaptation of Edgar Snow's Red Star Over China, is
scheduled to begin in August.
</P>
<P>
The film will be produced as part of celebrations to mark the
50th anniversary of the founding of New China.
</P>
<P>
American journalist Edgar Snow, a widely respected friend of
China, first visited the country in 1928. Snow wrote Red Star Over
China following a visit to the revolutionary base area in northern
Shaanxi Province in 1936.
</P>
<P>
The work introduced people throughout the world to China's
revolutionary struggle and the legendary 12,500-km Long March of
the Chinese Red Army.
</P>
<P>
The Changchun Film Studio, Jiangxi Film Studio and Jiujiang
Yangtze Film Corp. will jointly produce the film.
</P>
<P>
Screenwriter Li Chao said great emphasis will be placed on Mao'
s characteristics as a poet and a man of letters, rather than on
his achievements as a Chinese leader.
</P>

Snow visited the New China three times after 1949 and published
numerous reports on the nation's socialist construction.
</P>
<P>
He died in Switzerland in 1972 and part of his ashes were
buried in China according to his wishes.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Strives to Draw Tourists in New Millenium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has set up a
committee as part of promotion campaign to attract tourists from
both home and abroad to spend the new millenium celebration
activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The tourism committee was formed recently by the Ministry of
Natural Resources and Tourism following reports that there are
more than 3.8 billion people in the world wanting to know where
and how to celebrate the millenium.
</P>
<P>
Amant Macha, the chairman of the committee, said Tanzania is
one of the tourist destinations aspiring to get its share of the
lucrative market, the Daily News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
One of the ways to celebrate the arrival of the year 2000 is to
organize people to go to wonderful places in search of adventure,
have fun at millenium parties, relax on magnificent beaches or
hiking through lush forests, Macha said.
</P>
<P>
The nine-member committee will also collect, advertise and
disseminate information on major millenium events in Tanzania, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the millenium festivities will reach climax with a gala
party where best chefs from the country will prepare a dinner.
</P>

With abundant resources, Tanzania has developed rapidly in
tourism. In 1998, the east African country attracted 482,000
tourists, some 120,000 more than the previous year. Tourism
earnings in 1998 topped 570 million U. S. dollars, up 45.3

<HEADLINE> 20,000 Year Old Rhinoceros Skull Fossil Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The fossilized, almost intact, skull
of a rhinoceros believed to be 20,000 years old has been found in
northeast China's Heilongjiang province.
</P>
<P>
A worker in Liuhe Township of Mulan County discovered the skull,
which is perfectly preserved, about 15 meters beneath the ground
when he was digging for clay and sand to making bricks.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Xiujuan, of the provincial museum, the weight
of the animal could be around 1,500 kilograms and it was a large
herbivore which lived in a cold climate and has been extinct for a
long period of time.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the animal and the legendary mammoth belong to
the same family and were quite often found in frigid and temperate
zones.
</P>
<P>
"The fossil will provide important references for research into
the climate and geological conditions in northeast China about 20,
000 years ago," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The fossil is being restored for public exhibition in the
future.

<HEADLINE> Computer Network Introduced to Control Shoddy Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China's first computer network
designed to enhance controls on shoddy goods recently passed a
State technical appraisal.
</P>
<P>
The network, designed and developed by Zhejiang University,
will link manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, consumers and
supervisory agencies. Product information inputted into the
network will provide interested parties with an opportunity to
directly verify the authenticity of goods.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that the internationally advanced network
combines various traditional counterfeit prevention techniques and
computer technology. They also pointed out that the network will
accelerate China's efforts to eradicate shoddy and poor quality
products.
</P>
<P>
A knowledgeable source with the State Administration of
Internal Trade said the network will initially be used to
supplement the national supervisory system over the production and
sales of liquor.
</P>
<P>
China has faced major problems resulting from sales of shoddy
and poor quality goods over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The country has adopted a series of measures to tackle the
problem, including a program to expose related cases through the
media and punishing individuals engaged in the distribution of
related products.
</P>
<P>
China has published the results of product quality surveys in
Beijing newspapers since April 1997 in order to inform the general
public about poor quality goods.

<HEADLINE> Change Important in Grain Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The newest measures for reforming
China's grain marketing system indicate a substantial change in
policy-makers' judgment of the country's grain supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
"The ingrained idea that China is always in the grip of a tight
grain supply has been greatly shaken, if not completely abandoned,
" today's China Daily quoted Xie Yang, an economist at the
Development Research Center under the State Council, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ideological change will lead to a distinct
orientation in China's grain policy, as compared with past years.
</P>
<P>
Superficially, reasons for the recent round of reform are the
mounting stockpiles of low-grade grain and nearly unbearable
subsidies by the central government to State grain firms.
</P>
<P>
"However, nearly all problems in the current grain marketing
system can be attributed to an incorrect concept of China's grain
supply," said Lu Feng, an economist at the Chinese Center for
Economic Research of Beijing University. "That is, there is by no
means a surplus in China's grain market.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese tradition of regarding grain as supreme importance
to human existence and social stability, the searing memory of the
catastrophic famine from the early 1960s and the ever growing
population have all led policy-makers to conclude that supply-and-
demand balance in the grain market is rather precarious, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, whenever there is price fluctuation in the grain
market, policy-makers tend to think of the price wave as a signal
of a grain shortage and always turn to a certain form of
administrative power to restore the balance," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
China has at least three times witnessed an obvious grain
surplus during the past two decades - in 1985, mid-1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The three grain surpluses and the corresponding price
fluctuations are, in fact, testimonies to the market's spontaneity
in balancing grain supply and demand," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, repeated waves of grain price fluctuations have
not led to a more active role of the market, but tighter
government controls.
</P>
<P>
The recent moves by the government, such as lowering the
protective price for some grains will promote the market-oriented
reform of the grain marketing system, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
"But how far the reform can go is yet to be observed," Xie said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Coach Accuses Officiating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian coach Ismaila Mabo
accused the officiating of the women's World Cup, saying the
ejection of Nigerian forward in the match against Brazil was part of
a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
Patience Avre was sent off in Brazil's 4-3 sudden death
quarterfinal victory over Nigeria. Mabo said it was part of a
conspiracy to knock the Nigerian team out of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
After receiving a yellow card at the 41st minute, Avre got her
second and an automatic ejection from Mexican referee Virginia Tovar
Diaz at the 87th minute. Only three minutes earlier, Nigeria had
tied the score 3-3.
</P>
<P>
"It was a deliberate intention to ruin my team," Mabo said.
"The offense she committed on Maicon was not even a cautionable
offense. The referee kenw she already had a yellow card earlier and
went ahead and destroyed the Nigerian team."
</P>
<P>
Mabo said Avre was a victim of an acting job by Maicon:"I want
to appeal to FIFA to ensure that its referees have been instructed
to deal with players who fake injuries or take dives. I'm not happy
with the way my players were dealt with. But I'm not complaining."
</P>
<P>
Mabo was not the only one unhappy with the officiating. German
coach Tina Theune-Meyer was asked if "it was a mistake for FIFA not
to have the best referees" available during the World Cup after her
team's 3-2 loss to the United States, Meyer said:"that's true, I can
agree with that."

<HEADLINE> Thailand Steps up Campaigns against Alien Gangs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's immigration police have
asked foreign embassies in Thailand for intelligence information
on foreign criminal gangs so that they can step up campaigns
against them, The Nation newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The move follows widespread public complaints about a rise in
crimes committed by alien criminals over the past few months,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Foreign criminal gangs in Thailand have been involved in the
flesh and drug trades as well as human trafficking, preying mostly
on foreigners and using Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket as their
operating bases, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the gangs have operated by providing falsified travel
documents for foreigners and Thais to enter the United States,
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Scandinavia and European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Immigration Bureau Chidchai Wannasathit, said that
increased surveillance in areas frequented by foreign visitors
could help police curb foreign criminal activity, the paper
reported.
</P>
<P>
He urged the foreign embassies to cooperate in sharing
intelligence information with his agency. And So far 21 embassies
have exchanged intelligence information with his unit, according
to the report.

<HEADLINE> hke070511 - No Conflict Over Cabinet Seats in Coalition: Thai PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- There is no conflict over the
upcoming government reshuffle within the ruling coalition, Thai
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai was quoted as saying by Channel 9,
the state TV station Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Chuan stressed that the reshuffle must be completed within this
week and that the fresh faces to be introduced to the cabinet must
be chosen according to their individual character and ability.
</P>
<P>
Key members from all the partners of the coalition are expected
to meet later Monday to discuss the reshuffle, Sanan
Kachornprasart, secretary-general of the core ruling party, the
Democrat Party, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chart Pattana Party leader Korn Dabaransi, said his
party, the second largest in the coalition after the Democrat, is
waiting to be informed of the number of cabinet seats available
before selecting candidates for the posts.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the party said earlier that Chart Pattana will
not bargain for more cabinet seats under its portfolio.
</P>
<P>
All partners in the coalition should cooperate closely since
the majority of the government in the lower house has been reduced
due to the withdrawal of the Social Action Party, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Banharn Silpa-archa, leader of the Chart Thai Party, also said
that his party, the third largest in the coalition, has not asked
for more cabinet seats in the reshuffle.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Foundation to Convene Workshop For Its </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) Foundation will hold a workshop to formulate its
plan of action and work program from Tuesday to Wednesday in
Jakarta, according to a press release published by ASEAN
Foundation here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas will deliver the keynote

the ASEAN Foundation's plan of action and work program," the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN governments together with the governments of China
and Japan provided initial funding of the ASEAN Foundation.
Contributions from other ASEAN Dialogue Partners and from the
private sector, particularly big businesses in the region, will
hopefully comprise a significant portion of funds in the
foundation, the press release said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Auto Production Up Sharply This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Automobile production
recorded a 108.7 percent year-on-year rise in total production
during the first five months of this year, according to statistics
from Bank of Thailand available on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand assembled 103,943 vehicles during the first five
months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Based on the latest projection by the government and the
industry, Thailand's auto production this year is expected to
almost return to the 1997 production level of about 360,000 units,
although still far from the peak 1996 year volume of 559,428
units.
</P>
<P>
Thailand Board of Investment expects auto exports to climb from
67,000 units in 1998 to 160,000 this year and up to 200,000 in
2000.
</P>
<P>
Auto was one of the hardest hit industries in the crisis in
Thailand with sales plunging by 70 percent year-on-year for
several months since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
But now the auto workers are returning to the production lines,
and many auto factories are recruiting more workers in preparation
for the assembly of new models for 2000.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian "Queen of Soccer" Still Has a Shot at Best  Scorer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Though her team was beaten 2-0
by the United States, though Sun Wen of China tied her for the top
place on the leading scorers' list with two goals against Norway,
Brazilian "Queen of Soccer" Sissi still has a shot at the World
Cup's best scorer.
</P>
<P>
Sissi, the sole leader on scorers' list with 7 goals before
Sunday's semifinals, failed to find the target again in the match
against the United States. The host team won the match 2-0 thanks
to goals from Cindy Parlow and Michelle Akers.
</P>
<P>
Yet Sissi still has the chance to overtake Sun Wen for the best
scorer award as her team will play the third-place playoff against
Norway, the 5-0 losers to China in another semifinal match.
</P>
<P>
Sissi, a lean serene scoring machine, is "the true leader and
the key to Brazil's success" as described by soccer legend Pele.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old forward nailed a free kick in overtime against
Nigeria to send Brazil into the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Sissi's full name is Sisleide Lima do Amor. She drops her
romantic-sounding surname in the tradition of her country's players.
Few have come from a greater psychic distance to play in this
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Sissi grew up in the impoverished city of Salvador in northern
Brazil. She is one of seven children of a road construction worker
and his wife.
</P>
<P>
In Brazil, parents put soccer balls next to their infant sons
and give their baby daughters dolls to cuddle. But Sissi had
different ideas.
</P>
<P>
"I used to tear off the doll's heads and make them into soccer
balls. Then my parents decided to buy me a soccer ball so that
I could leave the dolls alone." said Sissi.
</P>
<P>
That was the beginning of Sissi's soccer career. When she was
14, her natural talent was so apparent that she left home to play
with a professional club.
</P>
<P>
Sissi played an important role in the Brazilian team. She
played every one of the matches at the 1996 Olympic Games in which
Brazil finished fourth behind the United States, China and Norway.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian coach Rica, who has coached the team for only three
months, had nothing but efusive praise for her:"When you look up in
the sky at night and see all the constellations, there is one star
that shines brighter."
</P>
<P>
But until a couple of weeks ago, Sissi was still labored in
obscurity. Even now, she is still receiving more attention in the
United States than in her own country.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Seeks to Bring Home "Runaway" Productions From Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Hollywood's actors and directors are
plotting to bring "runaway" American film and TV production home,
and that could strip Canada of millions of dollars, the Canadian
press reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the Screen Actors Guild and Directors Guild
of America as saying that "what bothers us is that American
companies are using American money making programs for American
and spending that money in Canada."
</P>
<P>
The American guild is planning to press the U.S. Congress to
come up with tax breaks for the industry, the report said, adding
all this could mean trouble for the Canadian film sector.
</P>
<P>
In British Columbia of Canada, producers, most of them American,
will spend one billion Canadian dollars (about 680 million U.S.
dollars) this year making TV shows and movies.
</P>
<P>
That means more than 20,000 jobs for a province with an
otherwise slumping economy, the Canadian press said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Declares Highest Alert Around Mayon Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
declared the "highest alert" around restive Mayon Volcano, which
has shown ominous signs of eruption, the Philippine Post said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who flew Sunday
to the volcano area in a helicopter, ordered evacuation
preparation in case of an eruption.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, as previously after its explosion on June 22, Mayon
belched white smoke and instruments registered non-stop tremors,
suggesting molten rocks were pushing their way up to the crater,
volcanologists said.
</P>
<P>
But Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute
of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), said that he didn't know
yet if the current activity will definitely lead to an eruption.
</P>
<P>
Alert Level 2 of the five-stage volcano alert system remained
in effect Sunday but Phivolcs expanded the six-kilometer danger
zone at the southeast sector of Mayon to seven kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Phivolcs earlier said an eruption could occur in days or weeks
if the ominous signs persisted.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that if a major eruption occurs, 12,359
families or 63,055 persons near the volcano would have to be
evacuated to 52 designated evacuation centers, reported the paper.
</P>
<P>
Looming over half a dozen towns in Albay Province in the
central Philippines, Mayon erupted 45 times in the past 360 years.
</P>
<P>
The deadliest was in 1814 when it buried a whole town and
killed 1,200 villagers. At least 77 people died in its last
eruption in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Falling Retail Prices Bring Challenges: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The continuous fall in retail
prices over the past 21 months may be a mixed blessing for the
Chinese economy, said an official of the State Development
Planning Commission (SDPC).
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the general price level is conducive to
smoothing out the uneven results of rapid economic development in
past years, and has improved living standards of the people as
well as sharpen the competitive edge of exporters, Wei Dale, with
the State Development Planning Commission SDPC was quoted by today
's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Wei said the fall in the retail price index will
reduce profits for enterprises, lower income of their employees,
weaken consumer confidence, and bring about a less active market.
</P>
<P>
The continuous fall in prices has increased investment risks,
reduced the rate of investment returns and influenced investor
confidence, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC, the country's highest pricing authority, is to take a
series of measures to tackle this issue in an effort to stimulate
domestic demand, according to Wei.
</P>
<P>
"The emphasis is being put on rural areas," Wei said, adding
that the purchasing price of agricultural products must be stable
and products with good quality will enjoy high prices.
</P>
<P>
Funds which were used for subsidizing producers in times of
short supply will be used now to boost consumption, and price
supervision will be strengthened to protect fair competition, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index began its fall in October 1997, while
the price index of the means of production, another important
reflection of the overall economic situation, has been in decline
for even longer, according to the SDPC's Macro-economic Research
Institute.

<HEADLINE> China's Disabled in Poverty to Get Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China's seven million disabled
people will get a helping hand to lift them out of poverty, the
country's English-language newspaper, China Daily, reported today.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the country's disabled population will be
adequately fed and clothed by the end of this century, according
to Cheng Kai, director of the poverty-alleviation office of the
China Federation of Disabled Persons.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident the goal can be achieved with the help of
special government funds, preferential policies, and the joint
efforts of disabled people and anti-poverty officials," Cheng was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 13 million poverty-stricken people with
disabilities across the country in 1997, most of them living in
rural areas, according to the federation.
</P>
<P>
About three million of them have shaken off poverty over the
past two years, accounting for almost one-fourth of the total,
Cheng said.

HANOI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's biggest
metropolis, received 418,453 foreign visitors in the first six
months of the year, an 11.5 percent year-on-year increase,
Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News reported Monday.

<P>
"The increase in tourist arrivals following the past two years'

The figures included a 20.3 percent increase in overseas
Vietnamese, and a 7.5 percent growth for other arrivals. The

<HEADLINE> China Dominate Defending Champions Norway 5-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BOSTON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China dominated defending champions
Norway 5-0 in a one-sided semifinal match here to set up a clash
against hosts the United States in the final of the women's World
Cup soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Ma Yuanan said on Saturday that Norway and China were
on the same level. But Sunday's semifinal told another story: the
Chinese team were just too strong for the Norway team to cope with.
</P>
<P>
Within 20 minutes, the Chinese team were already 2-0 ahead,
thanks to goals from captain Sun Wen and midfielder Liu Ailing.
</P>
<P>
Sun Wen, the top scorer of the Chinese team, scored the first
goal of the match for China with a left-footer. She also converted
a penalty kick at the 72nd minute to make her goal tally at the
tournament to 7, the same as the Brazilian forward Sissi.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team outshot Norway 11-2 in the first half and
enjoyed a 2-0 lead at half time. Sun wen had another two scoring
chances later in the first half, but her shots were all blocked by
the Norway goal-keeper.
</P>
<P>
Liu Ailing also scored twice in the match. She released a long
shot in the first half to consolidate China's lead and went on to
rocket home a shot at the 51st minute, making it 3-0 for the Chinese
team.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yan, another forward of the Chinese team, hit the crossbar
at the 58th minute. Bai Jie was also denied a goal by the crossbar
at the 76th minute.
</P>
<P>
Chinese defender Fan Yunjie made it 4-0 for her team after
tapping home a free-kick by Sun Wen at the 65th minute.
</P>
<P>
After Sun's second goal in the match, the Chinese team appeared
a little relaxed and Norway took the chance to test Chinese
goal-keeper Gao Hong.
</P>
<P>
The Norway team had several scoring chances in the last 20
minutes, but their efforts were all denied by Gao Hong who put up a
heroic performance.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yuanan said he was very satisfied with the result:"We are the
stronger team in the match. Norway played a simple game today while
our team were tactically sound. We deserved the victory."
</P>
<P>
China were also stronger in technique and team-work. They
enjoyed a dominant ball possession in the match and the result was a
honest reflect of the match.
</P>
<P>
China will play hosts the United States in the final at Los
Angeles on July 4. The American team battled into the final after
beating Brazil 2-0 at San Francisco earlier on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Unemployment Rate Declines to 8.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's unemployment rate which
stood at 13.1 percent when the present government assumed office
in 1994 declined to 8.8 percent in 1998, according to the latest
figures released by the Department of Census and Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The steady decline in unemployment in recent years is due to
the country's rapid economic growth and the growth of employment
opportunities, said the department.
</P>
<P>
Numerous new industries have been launched since 1994 following
attractive incentives being offered to investors.
</P>
<P>
Besides, many new industrial parks were set up in different
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Consequently tens of thousands of direct and indirect
employment opportunities were made available, specially in rural
areas, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Employment generation increased by about nine percent in 1998,
pushing the total number of employed persons to 6.08 million from
5.58 million in 1997, it said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' BOP Surplus Jumps 90 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' balance of payments
(BOP) surplus rose to 3 billion U.S. dollars for the first half of
this year, 90 percent higher than the 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in
the first semester in 1998, the Philippine Star said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted outgoing Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson
as saying that this is the 17th consecutive month that the country
has posted an external payments surplus.
</P>
<P>
Singson attributed the strong BOP to a weakening in the current
accounts position brought about by the economic recovery that is
supported by a development in the capital account.
</P>
<P>
The BOP is a measure of the country's external transactions
which include trade, transfers, investments and loans. It is
composed of three major items: balance of trade, current accounts
and capital accounts.
</P>
<P>
Singson told the paper that he remains confident that more
positive developments in the external sector will continue to
provide stability in the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
He also said the country's exports will regain momentum after a
momentary lull in March and April brought about by soft prices of
electronic products which comprised more than 50 percent of the
Philippines' total exports.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Singson is optimistic that the Asian
recovery is expected to help boost intra-regional trade and lure
back capital flows into the region.

<HEADLINE> Goal-Keeper Gives Host Team Semifinal Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Goal-keeper Briana Scurry was
the hero of the semifinal when the host team the United States beat
Brazil 2-0 here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The American team relied on offense in their first four matches
of the women's World Cup, but in Sunday's semifinals against Brazil,
it was Scurry who played a decisive role.
</P>
<P>
Scurry was tested throughout the game. She made six brave saves
to post her 52nd career shutout, her third of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The American team scored their lone goal of the first half at
the 5th minute. Julie Foudy sent the ball in front of the goal from
the left wing. Brazilian goal-keeper Maravilha got her hands on the
ball but fumbled it. Cindy Parlow was making a run to the near post
and the ball dropped right into her path, where she headed the ball
into the goal.
</P>
<P>
The game was even closer in the second half as the host team
failed to take control of the pace. The speedy and skilled
Brazilian team pressured the U.S. defense, only to have Scurry
repeatedly turn them back.
</P>
<P>
The host team finally broke through for a second opportunity in
the 79th minute as Mia Hamm was fouled in the penalty area. The
referee awarded a penalty kick to the American team and Michelle
Akers converted the kick to put her team 2-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
The American team will play the championship match against China
on July 10 at Los Angeles. It will be a rematch of the 1996 Olympic
gold medal match in which the American team prevailed.
</P>
<P>
In another semifinal match played later on Sunday at Boston, China,
with power and accuracy, trounced defending champions Norway 5-0 for a
berth in the final. It is the first time the Chinese team enter the
final of women's World Cup. They were beaten in the quarterfinals in
the inaugural World Cup in 1991 and finished fourth in the second
edition of the tournament in Sweden four years ago.

With the win, the top seeded American became the most
successful player of the century, winning the most times of the
men's singles event at the All England Club.
</P>
<P>
Sampras said he played the best match of his life to clinch his
sixth title in seven years, beating Bjorn Borg's 20th century
record of five titles.
</P>
<P>
Sampras also equaled the record of Australian Roy Emerson who
won 12 Grand Slam titles in his career. Add to this the 28-year-
old's record of being world number one for six years and, in
Agassi's eyes, he's out on his own as the greatest ever.
</P>
<P>
"He's accomplished more than any one else has, there's no doubt
about it," said Agassi.
</P>
<P>
Ironically he now takes over from Sampras at the top of the
rankings after his French Open title in June.
</P>
<P>
Another American player Lindsay Davenport beat seven times
champion Steffi Graf of Germany 6-4 7-5 to claim her first women's
title at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
The last American duo to win both singles titles were John
McEnroe and Martina Navratilova in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who first played here as a precocious 15-year-old with a
ferocious forehand, announced her ninth final was her last match
at the All England Club.
</P>
<P>
"There have been some unbelievable good times and it's been a
lot of fun... but there's got to be a time when I've got to move
on with something else in my life," said the 30-year-old.
</P>
<P>
She follows Boris Becker into the twilight of semi-retirement
and ends an unprecedented period of German success at the world's
most famous tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes became the first Indians to
win a senior Wimbledon title when they made their dream come true
by securing the men's doubles.
</P>
<P>
The top seeds, who won the French Open doubles title last month,
beat Dutchman Paul Haarhuis and Jared Palmer of the United States
6-7(10-12), 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) on court one.
</P>
<P>
In the women's doubles, Davenport, paired with American Corina
Morariu, defeated Mariaan de Swardt of South Africa and Elena
Tatarkova of Ukraine 6-4, 6-4 while Leander Paes and American Lisa
Raymond powered past Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and Russian Anna
Kournikova 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the mixed doubles final.

<HEADLINE>   Japan Beats Russia to Win Gymnastic Team Title (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan's first-string gymnasts
beat the mistake-prone Russians to take the men's team title at
the 20th World University Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese collected their winning total of 170.750 points
for their first-ever team title in decades after their successes
from the 50s up to the 70s and a heavy fall into the abyss after
China and Russia took over the podium.
</P>
<P>
Russia, headed by Alexei Nemov, the all-around individual
champion of the world championships in 1997 and the member of the
winning squad in the Olympic Games in 1996, finished second with
170.075 points.
</P>
<P>
China with its second-string squad collected the bronze medal
with 169.675 points as its gymnasts made a slow start from floor
exercise due to the too-soft sponge, said Chinese coach Bai
Yuanshao
</P>
<P>
Chinese Dong Zhen claimed a day-high 9.800 points in his
specialty of rings with a perfect performance by holding his body
up to a horizontal level while the audience hailed every move of
his routine with big applause.
</P>
<P>
"Dong Zhen is going to win the rings in the world championships
in October because nobody can stretch over his arms to a perfect
horizontal level in the world at the moment," said Chinese coach
Pan Chenfei, who also serves as a judge in the Universiade.
</P>
<P>
For the Japanese, the title was both a surprise and a certainty
as they already overtook the Russians before the final rotation
wherein the Russians had made glaring mistakes including Menov's
failure to show up his world-class calibre in the horizontal bar,
floor exercise and the rings, said Pan.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with the title as our gymnasts did not
make any big mistakes through all the six apparatuses," said
Tetsuro Murakami, head of the Japanese gymnastic delegation.
</P>
<P>
"But we need more hard training to prepare for the world
championships to be held in Tianjin, China in October," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese squad is composed of all the top three finishers
in the All-Japan Championships, namely Naoya Tsukahara, Akihiro
Kasamatsu and Yoshihiro Saito, besides Tatsuya Yamada and Takashi
Uchiyama.
</P>
<P>
"It's a surprise for me to see the Japanese to rush to the top
of world," said Joachim O. Sporel, a German freelancer for a dozen
years for the International Gymnastic Federation as well as the U.
S.-based International Gymnastic magazine.
</P>
<P>
As many countries have sent in their best gymnasts to the
Universiade, including Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and even the South
Koreans who finished second behind China in the Asian Games in
Bangkok, the Japanese did have a very strong showing in Palma, but
they are not expected to be the great winners in the upcoming
world championships in China, said Sporel.
</P>
<P>
"The Russians are still warming up for the world championships,
and of course the Chinese will send in their best gymnasts then,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I expect China will be the first, followed by Russia, in the
championships as it will also serve as the qualifier for the
Sydney Olympics," said Sporel.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Major Projects to Reduce Yellow River Silt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These projects include the construction of 20,000 large dams
with some 500 completed every year, engineers said
</P>
<P>
As the 5,800-km long Yellow River flows down from the Loess
Plateau it gathers some 1.4 billion tons of sand and silt every
year, causing severe soil erosion along its areas.
</P>
<P>
Huang Ziqiang, deputy head of the river's Water Conservation
Committee, said that once the series of projects are completed,
they will allow more than 1.5 million hectares of farmland to be
reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
By to the end of last year, some 170,000 sq. km. of land had
been reclaimed on the Loess Plateau in seven provinces and regions,
namely Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan provinces and the
Ningxia Hui and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions
</P>
<P>
Ningxia, where 75 percent of the farmland has been eroded, has
reclaimed 8,340 sq. km. of land in the past 10 years, twice the
amount of the preceding 30 years, and has built 60 key silt-
preventing dams with a combined water storage capacity of 150
million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The central government plans to invest 200 million yuan this
year on another 80 water and soil conservation projects along the
Yellow River.

<HEADLINE> Ancient City Discovered in Hubei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The site of a 5,000-year-old city has
been discovered at Tangchi Town, in China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The ancient city is elliptical in shape and has a south-north
geographical span of about 1,000 meters and 850 meters east to
west.
</P>
<P>
The city had earth walls, part of which had been washed away by
the nearby Silong river. Around the walls was a moat. The
surviving walls are one to four meters above the ground.
</P>
<P>
Also found were a large number of cultural relics from the
Neolithic Age.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists found a similar city at Menbanwan, 15 kilometers
away from the town of Tangchi in December of last year.
</P>
<P>
"People settled here partly because salt was produced in the
area," said Li Taoyuan of the Hubei archeology research institute.
</P>
<P>
The sites of eight cities from that period have so far been
found in Hubei and Hunan provinces, indicating that the middle and
lower reaches of the Yangtze river had an important position in
the history of Chinese society and civilization.

<HEADLINE> China to Prospect Seabed Natural Gas Hydrate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to prospect for
seabed natural gas hydrate, a new type of fuel believed to be very
rich under the sea.
</P>
<P>
The China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development
Association has already finished studies on exploration of the
hydrate and methods to prospect it.
</P>
<P>
More research projects will be launched on the economic
evaluation of natural gas hydrate resources, prospecting
technology, environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
According to Jin Xianglong of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
natural gas hydrate is a white solid substance that burns easily
and is likely to become a major kind of fuel in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
Total natural gas hydrate reserves under the sea are estimated
at 1.1 trillion tons, 100 times the amount on land.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's fifth-largest investor in undersea mining,
after France, Japan, Russia and India.

<HEADLINE> Australian Firm Wins Lawsuit Against British Company in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai No. 1 Intermediate
People's Court has ordered a British shipping company to pay 92,
706 U.S. dollars in compensation to an Australian design company
for patent infringement.
</P>
<P>
This was the city's first patent infringement case in which
both the plaintiff and the defendant were foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The European Container Shipping Company, the defendant, ordered
a container ship from a Japanese shipyard in 1992, and later
leased it to the Hong Kong-based Orient Overseas Container Line
Ltd. which then used it on the shipping route between Hong Kong
and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Advance Ship Design Company Ltd., the plaintiff, believed
the design of the ship was covered by its patent right for a
similar ship, and therefore sought but failed to get payment from
the European Container Company.
</P>
<P>
Advance then filed a lawsuit against both European Containers
and Orient Overseas Containers, asking for compensation of 414,500
U.S. dollars from European Containers.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that Advance's patent was valid in China and
should be protected in accordance with related laws.
</P>
<P>
It also ruled that Orient Overseas Containers was innocent
because it was not compulsory for the company to find out who held
the patent for the ship's design.

<HEADLINE> All Sides Would Accept Ballot Results in E. Timor: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas and East Timor's pro-independence leaders Sunday vowed that
all sides would accept the results of the U.N.-supervised ballot
on the future of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the government would not stay long in East Timor if
the August ballot opts for independence.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, the government would not leave the territory
in "an irresponsible way."
</P>
<P>
"What we're simply saying is that we are not going to pack up
in a huff," Alatas was quoted by national newspapers Monday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"We will attend to whatever issues which are related to the
separation. That will take a few weeks to a few months perhaps,
but don't think in terms of years, because we don't want to stay
that long," Alatas said after meeting top pro-independence leaders
Alexandre Xanana Gusmao and Jose Ramos-Horta at his office here.
</P>
<P>
Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Ramos-Horta said the
pro-independence faction reiterated to Alatas its "strong desire
to collaborate with the Indonesian government and the United
Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) in order to
secure peace and stability in the territory ahead of the ballot."
</P>
<P>
He said the pro-independence group would also honor the result
of the direct ballot even if it goes for the government-sponsored
autonomy plan.
</P>
<P>
"We will work to persuade our side to accept the people's
decision gracefully. Our view is that there should be no loser in
whatever the outcome is," Ramos-Horta said.
</P>
<P>
Jailed East Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao said his camp
strongly believed that the meeting would help smoothen a peaceful
solution to the East Timor problem.
</P>
<P>
"We hold to the view that we are not trying to find the winner
or the loser. It is the East Timorese people who should win. If
the people accept autonomy we are ready to accept it and join in,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Early this year the Indonesian government offered East Timor
independence if its people reject a wide-ranging autonomy under
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed
to hold the direct ballot in East Timor in August this year.

<HEADLINE> Universiade Round-up: American Swimmers Steal Limelight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States became the
biggest winners as its swimmers bagged home three out of six gold
medals from the first day competitions while Japan stunned the
world by beating top favorites Russia to take the men's gymnastic
team title in the 20th World University Games Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Cara Lane initiated the U.S legion's haul for golds as she
pulled something out of the bag, claiming the first event of the
women's 800-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
The final splash made the difference as Lane surpassed the
pacesetter Jana Pechanova of Czech Republic some 25 meters from
the finish line and powered home in eight minutes 42.62 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Pechanova, who led all the way until being overtaken by Lane,
had to settle for the silver in 8:43.91, with Lane's teammate
Julie Varozza in third in 8:46.83.
</P>
<P>
"I am very excited with my victory," said the Virginia
University freshwoman. "Pechanova swam very nice, but perhaps she
didn't notice me catching up."
</P>
<P>
Tomoko Hagiwara made Japan's presence in the pool felt as she
won the ensuing event of women's 100-meter butterfly in 1:00.47.
</P>
<P>
Cheered by her raucous teammates, the 19-year-old from
Yamanashi Gakuin University leapt to a power start and never
looked back throughout.
</P>
<P>
The silver went to Julia Ham of Australia who finished in 1:00.
86, with Pang Ran of China third in 1:01.05.
</P>
<P>
Mark Warkentin put Americans back to the winning track when he
clinched the gold of men's 200-meter freestyle in 1:51.30. Lionel
Poirot of France finished runner-up in 1:51.38. Dmitri Tchernychev
of Russia took the bronze in 1:51.83.
</P>
<P>
But America's winning momentum was thwarted as Czech Hana Cerna
and Russian Roman Makarov struck gold respectively in the
following two races.
</P>
<P>
Cerna finished first in the women's 400-meter individual medley
in 4:46.03, followed by Catalina Casaru of Romania in 4:48.52.
Corrie Murphy of the United States was third in 4:49.99.
</P>
<P>
Makarov clocked 2:16.07 to triumph in the men's 200-meter
breaststroke, beating Yoshiaki Okita of Japan to second in 2:16.12
with another Russian Andrei Perminov taking the bronze in 2:17.15.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Americans were strong enough as they won the
conclusive women's 4x200 meter in 8:13.41, through an unnerving
one-length lead in the first leg.
</P>
<P>
Japan finished second in 8:17.63, and Italy was third in 8:18.
11.
</P>
<P>
From the gymnastic competition, the Japanese men beat the
mistakes-prone Russia for the team title in decades.
</P>
<P>
Composed of the top three finishers in the All-Japan
championships, the Japanese gymnasts collected their winning total
of 170.750 points, beating the Russians to second with 170.075.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to win the title as our gymnasts did not make
any big mistakes," said Japanese gymnastic delegation chief
Tetsuro Murakami, adding that "we still have to train harder in
order to achieve better results from the upcoming world
championships to be held in Tianjin, China in October."
</P>
<P>
China, with its second-string squad for the Universiade,
finished third with 169.675 as its gymnasts made a slow start from
the floor exercise.
</P>
<P>
However, the day-high 9.800 points was awarded to Chinese Dong
Zhen who performed a routine of the rings by hanging up his body
to a perfect horizontal level.
</P>
<P>
Alexi Nemov of Russia, the individual all-around world champion
and a winning member of the Olympic squad in 1996, failed in the
horizontal bar, the floor exercise and the rings, to the misery of
the Russian squad.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Farmers Protest Over Food Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 Belgian farmers
demonstrated here on Sunday to protest against the government's
handling of the dioxin-contaminated food crisis.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators said compensation from the government was not
enough to offset their losses in the food crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a clash with journalists and local police, they overturned a
car belonging to a local TV and damaged equipment of foreign
journalists. Carrying banners saying "Your health, our livelihood,
" they blamed journalists for spreading panic over the health
scare.
</P>
<P>
The farmers were seeking higher compensations for lost sales in
both domestic and foreign markets in the wake of the food scare
started in late May.
</P>
<P>
The dioxin-contaminated food crisis is officially estimated to
cost 60 billion Belgian francs (1.54 billion US dollars). The
Belgian government has so far allocated 6.3 billion Belgian francs
(161 million dollars) to help farmers and businesses hit by the
food crisis, which is believed to be Europe's worst since the Mad
Cow crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that our politicians take measures to support
this sector, which has been seriously weakened by the exceptional
and sudden dramatic circumstances," organizers of the protest said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of farms suspected of receiving tainted animal feed
remain in effective quarantine. Their products are still banned
from sale unless scientific tests prove them to be dioxin-free.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Believes Guerrilla to Withdraw from Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States believes
militants who have crossed from the Pakistan-held Kashmir into the
Indian portion of Kashmir will be withdrawn under an agreement
reached between President Bill Clinton and Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif on Sunday, a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
"Our understanding is that there will be a withdrawal of the
forces now," said the official briefing reporters on the talks
between Clinton and Sharif. "Both have a great sense of urgency.
We want to see steps taken very quickly."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Sharif met on Sunday for three hours in a hastily

<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Estonian Jaan Kirsipuu put his
country on the cycling history after he won the first stage of the
Tour de France from Montaigu to Challans on Sunday. He became the
first rider from the Baltic nation to score a stage victory in the
Tour.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old is by no means an unknown face in the field
after winning 16 races last year including a stage in the Vuelta,
but most were in minor events.
</P>
<P>
This time, Kirsipuu who fell twice in the Tour last year,
stunned two of the world's best sprinters, Tom Steels from Belgium
and Germany's overall winner on the Tour for the past two years
Erik Zabel, with a powerful sprint over the last 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
American Lance Armstrong retained his overall leader's yellow
jersey on his country's Independence day.
</P>
<P>
Favorite Mario Cipollini of Italy finished a lackluster 29th.
</P>
<P>
Monday's second stage takes the riders 176 kilometers from
Challans to St Nazaire.

<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Following are the highlights of
today's major Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The current summer harvest in China has produced higher
yields and a better quality of grain thanks to a new government
agricultural policy which was introduced last year in a bid to
improve productivity and output. Since last Autumn, although many
areas have suffered from drought, the country's grain production
has remained stable, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that so far in 1999 the summer crops,
mainly wheat, covered about 31 million hectares, over 800,000
hectares less than in 1998, but the unit yields have increased and
the entire output may also be higher.
</P>
<P>
-- Poyang Lake, one of the biggest four fresh-water lakes in
China, has increased its flood storage area to that of 1954 due to
efforts in the past year.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, people in the east China province of Jiangxi
invested four billion yuan (about 800 million U.S. dollars) in
improving the overall conditions of the lake. The lake's flood
storage area has increased from 3,900 square kilometers in 1997 to
5,030 square kilometers, about the same level as that in 1954.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- Science and technology have become the engine for the
agricultural sector of the northwest China province of Qinghai.
About 100 million yuan (about 80 million U.S. dollars) more output
has been added to the sector as a result.
</P>
<P>
-- China's foreign trade entities have become more diversified
thanks to 20 years of reforms. All of the 320,000 overseas-funded
enterprises enjoy the rights of import and export.
</P>
<P>
 "China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- More than 10 tasks face Edmund Ho Hau-wah, the first Chief
Executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region, for
completion before the SAR is established on December 20.
</P>
<P>
-- The China Federation of Disabled Persons has pledged to help
lift seven million disabled people out of poverty by the end of
this century.

<HEADLINE> Dvorak Betters World Decathlon Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- World champion Tomas Dvorak broke
the decathlon world record here on Sunday, eclipsing the nearly
seven years old mark and getting close to exceeding 9,000 points.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Czech collected 8,994 points in the 10 events
on Saturday and Sunday at the European Cup Decathlon Team
Championship, beating the previous record of 8,891 set by Dan O'
Brien of the U.S. in Talence, France, on September 4 and 5, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Dvorak, bronze medalist in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, ran the 1,
500 meters in four minutes 37.20 seconds in the final event on
Sunday, having needed to finish in 4:54.04 to take the record from
his long-standing rival.
</P>
<P>
He created personal bests in Saturday's 100 meters (10.54
seconds), long jump (7.90 meters) and shot put (16.78 meters) and
Sunday's discus (48.33 meters) and javelin (72.32 meters).
</P>
<P>
On a day of sweltering heat, he also recovered from a
frightening incident in the pole vault when his pole snapped in
two. He went on to clear 4.90 meters.

<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 4 (Xinhua) -- American swimmers stole the
limelight in the first day of the swimming competition at the
World University Games here on Sunday when they snatched three
golds out of six at stake.
</P>
<P>
Cara Lane led the U.S legion's charge for golds as she pulled
something out of the bag, claiming the first event of women's 800-
meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
The final splash made the difference as Lane surpassed the
pacesetter Jana Pechanova of Czech some 25 meters away from the
finish line and powered home in eight minutes 42.62 seconds.
Pechanova, who led all the way until being overtaken by Lane, had
to settle for the silver in 8:43.91. Lane's teammate Julie Varozza
came in third in 8:46.83.
</P>
<P>
"I am very excited with my win," said a beaming Lane, a
Virginia University freshwoman. "Pechanova swam very nice, but
perhaps she didn't notice me catching up."
</P>
<P>
Tomoko Hagiwara made Japan's presence in the pool felt as she
won the ensuing event of women's 100-meter butterfly in 1:00.47.
</P>
<P>
Cheered by her raucous teammates, the 19-year-old from
Yamanashi Gakuin University leapt to a power start and never
looked back throughout.
</P>
<P>
The silver went to Julia Ham of Australia who finished in 1:00.
86, with Pang Ran of China third in 1:01.05.
</P>
<P>
Mark Warkentin put Americans back to the winning track when he
clinched the gold of men's 200-meter freestyle in 1:51.30. Lionel
Poirot of France finished runner-up in 1:51.38. Dmitri Tchernychev
of Russia took the bronze in 1:51.83.
</P>
<P>
But America's winning momentum was thwarted as Hana Cerna and
Roman Makarov struck gold respectively in the following two races.
</P>
<P>
Cerna of Czech finished first in the women's 400-meter
individual medley in 4:46.03. She was followed by Catalina Casaru
of Romania in 4:48.52. Corrie Murphy of the United States was
third in 4:49.99.
</P>
<P>
Makarov of Russia clocked 2:16.07 to triumph in the men's 200-
meter breaststroke. Yoshiaki Okita of Japan took the silver in 2:
16.12, and another Russian Andrei Perminov won the bronze in 2:17.
15.
</P>
<P>
But the Americans laughed last, winning the conclusive event of
women's 4x200 meter in 8:13.41.
</P>
<P>
The American quartet proved just too strong for their rivals.
They built an unnerving one-length lead in the first leg and never
gave their opponents any chance to narrow the gap.
</P>
<P>
Japan finished second in 8:17.63, and Italy was third in 8:18.

<HEADLINE> Quebec Nurses Continue Strike in Defiance of Government Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Despite the government-imposed
deadline of Saturday afternoon, some 47,000 striking Quebec nurses
stayed off their job on Sunday, the ninth day since they walked
out for higher pay on June 26.
</P>
<P>
The provincial legislature passed a law on Friday night that
ordered the nurses to return to the job by 4 p.m. Saturday local
time.
</P>
<P>
But some nurses suggested Sunday that a mediator might be
necessary to settle the impasse.
</P>
<P>
The local media say that the minimum annual wage for Quebec
nurses is 30,340 Canadian dollars (about 20,631 U.S. dollars), the
lowest among unionized nurses in the country, while the maximum
amounts to a national average of 44,072 Canadian dollars (about 29,
969 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The strike is not the only worry in Quebec's health-care system.
Some 1,000 pharmacists who work in hospitals have threatened to
resign en mass on September 4, if they do not get a 17 percent
salary hike.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- New technology in China's Hunan
Province is expected to receive 300 million yuan of government
financing this year.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the provincial finance department, 50
hi-tech firms have been singled out to benefit from it. So far,
some 177 million yuan of the fund has gone to these companies in
government shares, interest-deducted loans and direct government
financing. The remainder will be in place by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
An official from the department said that the new high-tech
sector has been designated by the provincial government for
priority in economic growth. Its output value reached 30 billion
yuan last year, making Hunan one of the country's top 10 provinces
in the hi-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Most of the province's hi-tech companies are in information,
machinery, new materials, bio-pesticides, and new agro-technics.
</P>
<P>
LG Sea Kwang Electric Co. Ltd., the largest Sino-foreign joint
venture in the province, was the first to receive government
funding; 30 million yuan of company stock in March. The company
earned profits of 70 million yuan in the first four months.

More than 2,000 cultural relics, mostly pottery, bronze and
agate articles, have been excavated from the tombs. Among them,
the rarest is a 2,000-year old pottery ship model.
</P>
<P>
Most of the tombs have chambers made of wood or brick, said an
archaeologist. The discovery are expected to provide valuable
clues for the study of the history and culture of the dynasties.

<HEADLINE> Japan Takes Men's Gymnastic Team Title at Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese gymnasts beat the
mistake-prone Russians to take the men's team title at the 20th
World University Games here Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese collected a total of 170.750 points for their
first-ever world team title in decades after their successes in
the 50s up to 70s and a heavy fall into the abyss after China and
Russia took over the podium.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with the title as our gymnasts did not
make any big mistakes through all the six apparatuses," said
Tetsuro Murakami, head of the Japanese gymnastic delegation.
</P>
<P>
"But we need more hard training to prepare for the world
championships this October Tianjin, China," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese squad is composed of top three finishers in the
All-Japan Championships, namely Naoya Tsukahara, Akihiro Kasamatsu
and Yoshihiro Saito, besides Tatsuya Yamada and Takashi Uchiyama.
</P>
<P>
"It's a surprise for me to see the Japanese to rush to the top
of world," said Joachim O. Sporel, a German freelancer for a dozen
years for the International Gymnastic Federation as well as the U.
S.-based International Gymnastic magazine.
</P>
<P>
As many countries have sent in their best gymnasts to the
Universiade, including Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, the Japanese
did have a very strong showing in Palma, but they are not expected
to be the great winners in the upcoming world championships in
China.
</P>
<P>
"The Russians are still warming up for the championships, and
of course the Chinese will send in their best gymnasts then," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I expect China will be the first, followed by Russia, in the
championships as it will also serve as the qualifiers for the
Sydney Olympics," said Sporel.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Sharif end Talks over Kashmir Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
ended his talks with Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif over
the Kashmir dispute on Sunday and said the United States planned
to issue a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We have a statement on that," Clinton told reporters when
asked if his talks with Sharif had yielded progress on ending the
confrontation between India and Guerrillas in the Himalayan region
divided between Indian and Pakistani control. But the president
gave no details about the statement.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said Clinton and Sharif sat
down at the official guest House, Blair House, at about 1:40 p.m.
EST for a hastily-arranged meeting about the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
"These are serious issues. The prime minister came a great
distance and the president is fully engaged in trying to see how
we can resolve the immediate situation," Crowley told reporters,
but he declined to discuss the substance of the discussions.
</P>
<P>
The Meeting was requested by Sharif on Saturday and Clinton,
after telephoning Indian Prime Minister Atal Vajpayee who raised
no objection, agreed the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders met initially for 40 minutes, and after a brief
break, they resumed the talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's National Security Adviser Sandy Berger also attended
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
White House officials said Clinton would not attempt to mediate
the dispute. They said he continues to believe that the Kashmir
problem must be resolved by direct dialogue between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"The United States does not plan to mediate" White House
spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters before the meeting. "this is
a situation that has to be resolved by these two countries and
these two governments directly."
</P>
<P>
But the White House officials said that Clinton, Sharif and
Vajpayee all agreed "the situation is dangerous and could escalate
if not resolved quickly."
</P>
<P>
Crowley told reporters that Sharif had brought "some ideas that
he wants to share with the president on how to resolve the current
situation."
</P>
<P>
Crowley said that Clinton believed it was appropriate for him
to meet Sharif given the "increasingly tense" situation in
Kashmir. He said Clinton was expected to call Vajpayee on Sunday to
brief him on the Sharif meeting.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Shoots Dead Minority in Bloomington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A gunman on Sunday shot and
killed a man outside a Korean Church in Bloomington, Ind..
</P>
<P>
Authorities linked the gunman to white supremacist group and
police believed he was targeting minorities in his deadly shooting
spree.
</P>
<P>
Police were searching the gunman, called Benjamin Daniel Smith,
who allegedly was driving a blue Ford Taurus and sped away after
firing four shots into a crowd of worshippers as they left church
about 11:30 a.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
The identity of the victim was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
Bloomington Police Chief Jim Kennedy said Smith is member of
the World Church of the Creator, an organization involved in the
distribution of anti-minority and anti-Semitic literature in
Bloomington last year, when Smith was a student at Indiana
University.
</P>
<P>
``The material he is passing out represents extreme right-wing
views. It's very anti-minority, very anti-Semitic and it certainly
alarmed the people in this community,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said Smith matched descriptions provided by Chicago
police of the gunman being sought in connection with several
attacks in Illinois on Friday night. Those attacks left a black
former college basketball coach dead, and six Orthodox Jews
wounded.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Sharif Reach Agreement on Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- pakistan's Prime Minister and
U.S. President Bill Clinton ended their talks over the Kashmir
dispute and issued a joint statement, calling for restoration of
the Line of Control in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"It was agreed between the president and the prime minister
that concrete steps will be taken for the restoration of the Line
of Control," said the joint statement, released by the White House
after the two leaders ended their talks.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement said the two agreed the confrontation
"contains the seeds of a wider conflict" and "it was vital for the
peace of South Asia that the Line of Control in Kashmir be
respected by both parties."
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged an immediate cessation of hostilities once steps
were taken to restore the Line of Control. The breaching of the
line by insurgents prompted India on May 26 to launch an air and
ground offensive to drive the guerrillas back.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Sharif agreed that the way to resolve issues
between India and Pakistan, including the Kashmir conflict, was
the direct talks initiated in February in Lahore. "The president
said he would take a personal interest in encouraging an
expeditious resumption and intensification of those bilateral
efforts once the sanctity of the Line of Control had been fully
restored," the joint statement said.
